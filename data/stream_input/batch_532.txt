B000A6T1KE|4.0|It seems like every person has jumped on the bandwagon that this was a terrible movie. People..lighten up! While the Director was not the best choice (Nimoy would have been ideal), and the story could have used some more familiar elements (Spock is supposedly still on Romulus, right? What about Sela?), this was still a worthy effort by a wonderful acting troupe. I have been a fan of Star Trek and watched nearly every episode and movie (yes, even the short lived cartoon series) and find nothing in the movie that would make anyone think this movie is that bad. Did it perform well at the Box Office? No..and that is not because it is a bad movie, but because the powers that be decided to open it at the worst time to do so...in December when a lot of other Big Budget flicks open (i.e. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc). Had this movie opened two months earlier or two months later, it would have broken the $100,000,000 mark with ease, instead of languishing in the basement where it ended up. This was one Trek's strongest outings and ranks up there with the best of the even numbered Trek movies and for all those folks out there who rate this movie below The Final Fronteir and Insurrection...you might as well pack up and move away from Star Trek, because you know not what you say. In the end everyone, remember, that this is a movie for entertainment purposes and it delivers that!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Tonight at about 11:39 p.m., make a pot of coffee, drink a few cups.  At about 2:00 a.m. put on \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and listen to \\"Visions of Johanna\\" three or four times in a row. . . .  There's another soulful version of that song in \\"No Direction Home\\".  When you see Bob Dylan performing live you can hear his idea at its root.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|First of all, it was dumb to not release the extra scenes and footage with the first DVD set.  But, at least, releasing it now is better than never releasing it.  So, I'm glad they finally decided to stand up and get it done.  It's only 2005 so I suppose eight years isn't so bad to wait.  :-(  Anyway, this is an excellent film.  I recommend it highly for each and every family.  It's just an excellent film.  You won't find a better well made film than this one and probably won't see one made like this for a long time.

B0009S3HI0|3.0|I love the Deftones. Let me just say that. I just think this could have been a lot better thats all. The songs on here are okay, there are a couple that DO stand out and are great but for the most part this seems a little too bootleg for something that costs as much as it does.<br /><br />The DVD that come along with it is nice because it has all of the Deftones videos plus some extra things between them but as I was watching it I realized...well...the Deftones only have a couple really good videos, like Change. All the rest are kinda... blah! But I mean I do like the songs so it's worth watching for that.<br /><br />All I have to say is, if you really love the Deftones like I do then go ahead and buy it, it's fun. But if you only sort of like the Deftones then it's probably not for you.
B0007NFL18|1.0|Is he serious? Was this album some sort of joke? It wasn't worth what I paid. And I bootlegged the stupid cd for me and 10 of my friends, we were all mad. He should be paying me to cop this garbage. All 50 fans who say this album is great, 50's got tight flow, lies. Face it, the fool can't rap. Period. He's garbage, even Dre and Em can't help him.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There was once, some years ago now, a television show that involved heroes. Real, clever, gritty heroes, who dressed like cowboys, flew spaceships, and cursed in Mandarin Chinese. They exchanged witty repartee, travelled the 'Verse from one end to the other looking for work (honest or not), and even attended a couple of Shindigs. When things got a little slow, there was always the psychotic psychically-gifted child to look after, or the flesh-mutilating cannibals from the edge of space to avoid.<br /><br />And then Fox, in a decision even more mind-numbingly stupid than airing any of its reality shows, cancelled it mid-season. Thanks to the efforts of Browncoats (as \\"Firefly\\" fans call ourselves), \\"Firefly\\" lives again, with all fourteen episodes (two of them originally unaired) and some juicy extras on four DVDs. Joss Whedon's sci-fi/Western/fantasy world - once described to me as \\"Star Wars, but Han Solo's world, with Han still shooting first\\" - is one of the most original things to air on television in a long while...possibly ever.<br /><br />\\"Firefly\\" is set approximately five hundred years in the future, in a new universe with \\"terraformed\\" planets made inhabitable for Earth colonists, whose numbers have grown too many for Earth-that-was. Chinese and Western cultures are the dominant influences; characters dress like John Wayne and are fluent in Chinese, at least enough to swear in. Unlike most sci-fi, there are no aliens; the Reavers, cannibals who mutilate their own flesh and eat others, were once human too, till something drove them over the edge of sanity. The Alliance, a hyper-controlling government coalition of the central planets, manages most legal trade and activities, and have ever since they won a war some years back with the Independents (or \\"Browncoats\\").<br /><br />With the Alliance in control of all legal economic activity, those Browncoats were forced to retreat to the \\"raggedy edge,\\" taking what jobs they could to eke out an existence. Some of these are the crew of Serenity, a most rag-tag group of compatriots whose numbers include warrior woman Zoe; her husband, geeky pilot Wash; cheerful and naïve mechanic Kaylee; gentle man of the cloth Shepherd Book; exotic geisha-like \\"Companion\\" Inara; ship's doctor Simon Tam and his genius but damaged sister River; and man's man Jayne, the blunt mercenary with a softer side. They are led by Captain Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds, who is if nothing else a man of determination, who lives by his own code of honor: stand by your crew, love your ship, get the job done.<br /><br />It is in this world, with these people, that \\"Firefly\\" makes its home. And what a home it is; even though we only get fourteen episodes, it is easy to develop attachments to these characters, and to care about what happens to them. Whedon's stories are tailored to provide layered character development, with each episode building on the last one's jokes and insights. Even Serenity, the ship itself, becomes a character of sorts: its nooks and crannies feel familiar and homely, something to be loved and protected.<br /><br />In this short span of time we also learn that Book is not all he appears to be, that River has been brutally experimented on by the Alliance to make her into a weapon, and that Mal has serious issues with womenfolk and relationships. It is sad that these hints of stories were cut off before they could be told; one senses that \\"Firefly\\" could have developed into the most interesting show on television if handled properly.<br /><br />What it undeniably is, however, is fourteen episodes' worth of brilliance. Whedon's dialogue is one of the high spots of the show: rarely has anything been as quotable as \\"Firefly.\\" The wacky humor and the often unfamiliarly Westernized syntax give a simultaneously homey and foreign feel to the show and its characters; we recognize these people as kin to us, but maybe second cousins. The theme song is particularly good, an innately hummable ballad that will stick in your head even when you're not watching the show.<br /><br />The acting is truly amazing; although there are no big names here, everyone delivers heartfelt performances that feel real and personal; they make us care about their characters. It's hard to pick a standout performer; this crew works together as an outstanding ensemble, and they are the core of the show's strength.<br /><br />There's no shortage of action, either: as outlaws on the run from the government (and sometimes disgruntled employers), the crew of Serenity encounter their share of enemies, including the sadistic Dr Niska and the sinister bounty hunter Jubal Early. And there's River, too, prone to psychotic episodes that endanger everyone in her path.<br /><br />There are true gems even amongst the fourteen: my favourite episodes are \\"Shindig,\\" \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds,\\" \\"War Stories,\\" and \\"Objects in Space.\\" All of them are excellent, but these four combine all the elements of style, dialogue, humor, and action into episodes that will inspire side-splitting laughter and some moments that will take your breath away.<br /><br />A sidenote: there is a movie addition to the Firefly 'Verse, in the form of \\"Serenity.\\" It's darker and grittier than \\"Firefly,\\" but well worth seeing on its own merit as a fabulous space opera. So go ahead, embrace your inner Browncoat, and immerse yourself in the wonder of the Firefly-that-was. \\"Take me out to the black, tell them I ain't comin' back; burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me...\\"ng the show.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|These Walls is an awesome song.  It is one of Dream Theater's best.  Ok, I guess as complete album, it is not a collection of great licks.  But These Walls is an amazing song.  I don't know why I love it so much; maybe it speaks to something in my soul.  I also think it just fits together as a great piece of music and is itself one of Dream Theater's greatest songs.  If I was in hard rock band, I would encourage band mates to cover it as much as we could.<br /><br />I lost interest for awhile when Scenes from a Memory came out; I just felt no life in the music from that one.  I couldn't get into the dark story the lyrics told.  Train of Thought is prog-metal to the core and Octivarium brings out more of their new keyboardist's talents.  Dream Theater is back!!!! I saw them live in Irvine recently; they are by far the best in all hard rock genres right now!

B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a huge Green Day fan since way back before junior high school (I have since finished college and started a family).  I've been to numerous concerts of theirs, and own just about everything they've ever released.  When I heard that they were releasing a new album, I had my money set aside months in advance.  I don't think anything could ever top Dookie, (it is the standard for all to follow) but American Idiot comes really close.  I loved Insomniac, liked Nimrod, and wished Warning was better (it was still OK), this takes the best elements of all of them.  They intergrate new elements into their music and come out stronger with a political message than any mainstream band has done for awhile.  The only reason this album would not be considered to top Dookie would be that a couple of the songs have to be listened to several times before really becoming good (like Wake Me Up When September Ends) other than that I have no complaints and hope that then new DVD that they are releasing will kick butt as much as this!
B0002EXH5O|4.0|I just bought this the other day, I have the original, but I was looking around in the shop one day, and saw this, so I figured I would check it out remastered, while it not being bad at all, it's just really different hearing it like this, because I've been listening to the original for years, so long time fans of this album, this remaster will take some getting used to, but it's not all that bad, Dave DID re-do the vocals on \\"Take No Prisoners\\" \\" Five Magics\\" and \\"Lucretia\\", that is what will take the longest for me to get used, but I still have the original, so I can always throw that in for the original vocals on those, as you can see, it comes with bonus tracks, which are nice, first is \\"My Creation\\" nothing spectacular, but it's kind of cool, then comes the demo of \\"Rust In Peace...Polaris\\", which is very different in certain spots from the final version, but it's cool to hear the demo, pretty much the same with \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\\", The \\"Take No Prisoners\\" demo is not much different, aside from a few lyrics, all those demos have Chris Poland on them, nice to hear them, now a rundown of the songs on the original release <br /> <br />Holy Wars...The Punishment Due: 5/6!!!, a Thrash classic, one of Megadeths best songs here, just listen to the solos <br /> <br />Hangar 18: 5/5, another great song, one of the most popular, along with Holy Wars, the video rules too! <br /> <br />Take No Prisoners: 5/5, The original version is better, but this will probably grow on me, great song <br /> <br />Five Magics: 5/5, same as above <br /> <br />Poison Was The Cure: 5/4, although still a good song, not as good as others on this release <br /> <br />Lucretia: 5/4, same as above, love the laugh at the beginning <br /> <br />Tornado: 5/5, great song, it picks up after the prior 2 <br /> <br />Dawn Patrol: 5/4, just a cool bassline, with drums, and Mustaine talking in a british accent <br /> <br />Rust In Peace...Polaris: 5/6!!!, great song to finish off a great album, nice and heavy, cool vocals <br /> <br />Well, there you have it, a great album, the remaster is OK, dig the demos and stuff, the songs with the re-done vocals will probably grow on me, if they don't, I'll just throw the original on, but anyways, if you've never heard this, and you like Metal, and old Metallica, check it out, you should like, Later! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009S3HI0|4.0|Most fans know (or should know) that, when it comes to making a new album, the Deftones are perfectionists, so it usually takes them several years to release it. And just when I started getting antsy, waiting for the new record, I started to think I should buy/download/collect the Deftones' live albums, C.D. singles, and soundtracks. Then, in celebration of his band's ten year anniversary, frontman Chino Moreno released this C.D.; a compilation of b-sides, rarities, covers, and live material.<br /><br />To be fair, some of the songs (i.e. \\"Savory,\\" \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\") aren't very memorable, and \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\" is a big disappointment. Plus, most of the rest of the songs are definitely not good enough to be on a real Deftones album.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean this album is bad, because several of the songs are really quite decent. \\"Sinatra\\" and \\"Crenshaw Punch\\" are probably the heaviest songs on the album, and \\"Simple Man\\" and \\"No Ordinary Love\\" are Lynyrd Skynyrd and Sade covers. The latter, \\"No Ordinary Love\\" is an interesting cover, with some good, feminine singing by Chino. \\"The Chauffeur\\" is another cover, this time of a Duran Duran song. It originally appeared on the second \\"Resident Evil\\" soundtrack, and it's very spacey and kind of creepy, even.<br /><br />The acoustic renditions of \\"Change (In the House of Flies),\\" and \\"Mechanical Bath\\" are softer than, but otherwise not very far removed from the original versions (they're equally as atmospheric and soothing). And the acoustic version of the classic `Tones tune, \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\" is decent; it has some more good singing. But I just prefer the original version; the acoustic guitars lose the momentum and groove that the electric guitars had.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Wax and Wane\\" is very spacey, with a catchy drum beat and rhythm, and the \\"Idiot Version\\" of \\"Teenager\\" (a song that originally appeared on the Deftones' 2000 album, \\"White Pony\\") is also quite similar to the original, except this version includes a few light guitar strings. \\"Black Moon\\" sounds somewhat out of place, but nonetheless an interesting and unexpected inclusion. It's a straight-up rap song, featuring a guest appearance by a member of Cypress Hill.<br /><br />The bonus disc is a live DVD, and it is absolutely sick. This DVD (which features 3 songs from \\"Adrenaline,\\" 2 songs from \\"Around the Fur,\\" 3 songs from \\"White Pony,\\" and 3 songs from \\"Deftones\\") more than makes up for the b-sides that were duds on the CD. I've only seem the Deftones live once, and when I did see them, I was not very impressed; but this concert footage gives me a whole new opinion about their live show.<br /><br />If you weren't a Deftones fan before, you won't find much of interest, here. But for people like me, this release is pretty much everything you could ask for. It's a nice snack to tide us over until the new album, which is supposed to be among the Deftones' best work, hits stores in early or mid 2006.o quite similar to the original, except this version includes a few light guitar strings. \\"Black Moon\\" sounds somewhat out of place, but nonetheless an interesting and unexpected inclusion.

B000002UB6|5.0|LET IT BE in my opinion is one of the better BEATLE albums. Its an easy album to listen to. I don't know why people would knock on it, other than LONG AND WINDING ROAD. I can't stand that song, one of the worst.<br /><br />HOWEVER as far as the rest goes; I have the vinyl from 1970. On the back it reads something like \\"This is a new phase BEATLE album.\\" Maybe thats what it was, however I think it was just marketing. I'm pretty sure the Beatles were aware that this was the LAST phase. They originally didn't want to even release this album.<br /><br />PHIL SPECTOR was hired to take the tapes, actually recorded for a film LET IT BE, and make them into an album. What you get is a very different sounding BEATLES. A new phase? Whatever, its still good. I like this album more than others for sure. Its earthy, bluesy, a little more raw. At least not as polished as everything else.<br /><br />TWO OF US acoustic guitar and harmonies between John and Paul, nice. I DIG A PONY is a little strange, but cool, garage/beatle feeling. ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a great song, one of Johns best hippie songs, I ME MINE is one of Georges best, DIG IT and MAGGIE MAY are just some juvenile kiddery that surround the title track. This is all good to me, I enjoy hearing them in the studio goofing around, and chattin'. You get a lot of that here. The goofin won't be found on LET IT BE NAKED the new version of this album. Anyway... I GOT A FEELING is one of the strongest tracks here, very good, ONE AFTER 909 is one of my faves. A raw sounding recording of a song these guys used to mess around with before they were big. There are much earlier recordings of this on ANTHOLOGY ONE. This one rocks out though.<br /><br />LONG AND WINDING is rubbish as far as I'm concerned. It was a hit single though so you might like it. The last two are the strongest cuts, FOR YOU BLUE, a nice bluesy one from George and the country style GET BACK, which was recorded on top of a rooftop in front of a bunch of people. A \\"live\\" performance, that fans had been waiting four years for, it was a spur of the moment thing which made it huge news in the day. At the end John says \\"Thank you and I hope we passed the audition,\\" and everybody laughs and laughs. This closed the door on THE BEATLES for good. Let it be, was the message. One of the best in the BEATLES back log. Dig it.mance, that fans had been waiting four years for, it was a spur of the moment thing which made it huge news in the day.

B00002MZ2C|5.0|This album, the third from Rage Against the Machine, has long been one of my favorite C.D.'s, and it used to be THE favorite. Every band member--especially guitarist Tom Morello and vocalist Zach de la Rocha-- are at the top of their game, here, and this C.D. just sounds awesome! \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" is possibly Rage's heaviest and angriest effort, and almost every song is a hit. It's hard to pick best songs, but the radio hit \\"Guerilla Radio\\" (which has great riffs, angry rapping, and lots of yelling), \\"Testify,\\" \\"Calm Like a Bomb,\\" \\"Ashes in the Fall\\" (which is a song where Zach builds from a whisper to a yell), \\"War Within a Breath,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Sleep Now In the Fire\\" stand out the most. Most of the song structures are the same (with Tom Morello making hip-hop sound effects for Zach de la Rocha to rap over in the verses, and Tom plays bigger, chunkier riffs in the choruses), but when the album sounds this great, how can you complain? This album, which Spin Magazine listed as one of the best C.D.'s of the last 20 years, is also (of course) lyrically very powerful. Zach was always a great vocalist, and an even better lyricist; he could rap in a way that would force you to hang on to every word. \\"Guerilla Radio\\" battles Al Gore, whereas \\"Sleep Now In the Fire\\" is about government greed, \\"Testify\\" is about a whitness testifying in court, \\"Born As Ghosts\\" rhymes about children becoming soldiers and fighting in war, and \\"Ashes In the Fall\\" takes on religious hypocrisy. This is, in my opinion, this group's finest hour. Tom Morello's crazy guitar noise makes every song sound awesome, and Zach's lyrical strength and bold political statements makes this album relevant and timeless, even several years after its release. Sadly, however, \\"Battle of Los Angeles\\" would be Rage Against the Machine's last album of new material (2000's \\"Renegades\\" was a covers album.) Well, at least they went out on top!
0743454537|5.0|Often, we take difficult situations for granted.  We are quick to say what we might or might not do when pressed with ethically challenging scenarios.  Jodi Picoult weaves an intriguing tale of one family's struggle to do \\"the right thing\\" for one child, while disregarding \\"the right thing\\" for another child.  <br /> <br />In this novel, a precocious teenager is placed in the unenviable position of being the \\"spare parts\\" depositiory for her older sister, who is suffering from lukemia.  This young lady retains an attorney to help secure her legal voice in medical matters - much to her parent's shock and emotional upheaval.  This book shines a light on the potential conflicts involved with having a subsequent child for the specific purpose of being a donor for a fatally ill sibling.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|When Megadeth released \\"Cryptic Writings\\" in 1997, it looked for a while that they weren't going to follow in Metallica's footsteps and release an alternative-metal album. But, unfortunately, since Megadeth and Metallica followed very similar career blueprints, I think it was only a matter of time before Dave Mustaine and Co. released their \\"Load.\\"<br /><br />Now, \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" were doubtlessly experimental albums, but I don't think they were \\"sell-outs.\\" But, I think there's really no disputing that Dave Mustaine saw the success of those albums, so he \\"pulled a Metallica\\" as it were, and released \\"Risk\\" in 1999. Not only was this album a greedy, selfish move, but it was also a very \\"risky\\" one. Dave risked alienating all of his fans with this record. Most of his fans had been wanting him to go back to his roots and release a raw, aggressive, thrashy album (like Megadeth's first three discs); but, instead, he did the exact opposite. Therefore, it's not at all surprising that many fans are lukewarm and even hate this album. Professional critics have labeled it \\"a pop metal mistake\\" and even \\"an unbelievable turd.\\"<br /><br />But, while this may indeed be Megadeth's weakest effort, I think it is also quite underrated. Yes, all of the riffs and most of the famous guitar solos are now gone, and yes, ballads like \\"The Doctor Is Calling\\" are somewhat boring. But \\"Risk\\" is still very decent. It sounds fine, and most of it is catchy enough to make up for its pitfalls.<br /><br />The album opener, \\"Insomnia,\\" is the biggest standout track on the record. It is an electronic, Nine Inch Nails-esque tune, with a very catchy chorus (\\"Insomnia-ia-ia-ia\\"), a pretty cool guitar solo, and (what sounds like) a violin in the background. While the rest of the album may not be as immediately memorable, there are a handful of other good tracks, here. Plus, many of the songs have a chorus which you'll be dying to hum along to. \\"Prince of Darkness\\" features bobbing/skipping, semi-crunchy guitars, and a couple of Cookie Monster-like growls and \\"Crush `Em\\" has another rhythm which wouldn't be out of place on a NIN record, as well as an honest-to-god shout-along chorus. Elsewhere, \\"Breadline\\" is also quite catchy, and \\"I'll Be There\\" might be hated by some `Deth diehards for being too mainstream, but it has a nice, melodic, sing-along part. Finally, \\"Time\\" is divided into two parts; the first part \\"Time: The Beginning\\" is an acoustic ballad, but the latter half, \\"Time: The End,\\" is actually pretty heavy.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Risk\\" is definitely not an album which the members of Megadeth should be most proud of, but it does have its moments in the sun. And this album, as a whole, serves as an essential part of every complete Megadeth collection.<br /><br />Now, there's really no need to shell out the money to buy the remaster if you already own the original, because the original's production/sound quality was good, too.uple of Cookie Monster-like growls and \\"Crush `Em\\" has another rhythm which wouldn't be out of place on a NIN record, as well as an honest-to-god shout-along chorus.

B00005NGZX|5.0|I'm slightly new to Converge, but I'd say that I'm becoming a huge fan of them - this CD rocks harder than most other so called hardcore bands and is some of the finest Noisecore music you'll ever hear. I highly recommend this album for fans of The Dillinger Escape Plan
B00004WLXZ|4.0|People are ecstatic about this documentary. Sure, it is a good one : full of innovations and daring angles. Leni dared to do what other directors did not : putting her camera in people's face, looking at things in an active manner and not with the passive neutrality of a robot. I am sure she would  have done exactly the same  job if she had been American and the Republican Party had a huge political rally in Washington DC. But she was German and the rally was Nazi, so since then she has been prosecuted, harrassed and vilified. Poor Leni, she was not a Nazi, just an ambitious woman who believed in her job, filming. Triumpf of the Will must be taken for what it is : a very good documentary even if it does exalt the Nazi regime. As somebody said, men talk about it,  women feel it. She did.  But I would not qualify Leni as an artist : she lacked the distance, the critical approach of the subject that make real artists. She was basically a very gifted sycophant who jumped on the band wagon. Fascinated by powerful bodies and the violence they express, she fell in the Nazi trap. She must not be criticized for her opinions but for her lack of lucidity. Arno Breker and Albert Speer fell in the same trap, both paid dearly for that, Leni got away with it, probably because she was a woman.
B000957O82|4.0|Will Smith has been known over the years as a awesome action movie character.  Bad Boys I and II, Independence Day, I Robot, etc.  He never really has done a romantic comedic film until now and newsflash...he's awesome at that too!!!  Alex Hitchins role seems to be made for Will Smith by the way that he can harness and make the role his own with a lot of his own personality evidently being drawn through this part. <br /> <br />Alex Hitchins is a consultant \\"love doctor\\" that helps out love struck men land the \\"girl of their dreams\\" despite their own geeky and clumsy persona.  The main focus of the film is on helping Albert, a love struck account to land the girl of his dreams, Alegra Cole- only the most sought after socialite of New York City.  They go through many trial and errors towards the path of getting the game right, but in the end do they get together? You have to see the movie to find out.  During this battle Hitch himself is fighting a battle of falling in love with local newspaper columnist, but making all the wrong moves in landing this perfect girl. <br /> <br />The movie has a very good mix of comedy with romanticism.  Perfect for a first date or with your special someone.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|To begin, I have to say that I was very skeptical about Avenged Sevenfold's new album. I had bought \\"Waking the Fallen\\" and I was disappointed at the lack of any real creativity or unique style.  They sounded like any other speed-metal band, which became very boring to me very quickly. But with this new album, \\"City of Evil,\\" I was happy to say that their new sound had really taken a turn for the better.  The only way to describe the huge orchestral arrangements, heavy and technially-proficient guitar solos, precise yet effortless drumming, and the new style of vocals which I think fit very well with the new sound, is to call it epic. At the beginning of track 9 \\"Strength of the World\\" there is even a Western-themed arrangement that I found to still fit very well within the overall \\"color-scheme\\" of the album.  Many have argued that the new vocal style is very pinched-sounding and gets in the way of the guitar solos, but the voice is an instrument like any other and it's not really getting any more attention than the guitar or the drums, because everybody in the band is a professional musician and they all deserve some respect in that regard. This album is by far the best I've heard in a long time and I hope that their next one is even better, and I think any metal or just rock fan should definitely check it out.  You may find yourself expanding your musical tastes a bit.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|No sophomore jinx for Buble. This offering is even better than his first and that says an awful lot. <br />Not one bad song choice or note just proving he is the real thing. <br />Buble, bring us more!  <br />
B000001GAM|5.0|I bought this disc during a trip in Innsbruck. First I was reluctant because of the high price. But the instinctive attraction toward Giulini's art had woned at last. I discover probably one of the greatest interpretation of the mighty Bruckner's symphony no.9 . In my opinion the only true rival of this version is the mystical Celibidache with Munich Philharhomic - 1995 on EMI. Listen to the huge crescendo built from second theme just before the serene finale of the Adagio. It is a moment of awesome true terror. Giulini reaches here a tension that's unrivalled on disc. It's truly  shattering.This happens only when music is regarded as \\"wahrheit\\" and not just a simple sonorous pleasure.  Five stars and my highest recommendations.
B000B0WODA|4.0|The first time I heard Franz Ferdinand was a couple years back when I got one of the Madden Series and Take Me Out was on it.  Since I plated the game way too much, the song got on real tired to me by the time it hit the radio to the point I would always turn it off and play Madden on mute to avoid the song.  A couple months went by, and I had moved on from playing Madden for hours a day, I saw the song again on the original PSP commercial and the song began to grow on me again. <br /> <br />Franz Ferdinand named for the dude who started the First World War, is back with their second album, You Could Have it so Much Better.  Much of the songs are so upbeat ands danceable, it make you sad that summer is over, but at least you will have something to put on at your Halloween party when Monster Mash gets overplayed.  The party gets started with The Fallen, the catchiest of all the dance songs, but still has a dirty feel to it.  The new single Do You Want To sounds like something that would be at home at the disco in the 70's.  You Could Have It So Much Better has the type of time changes that made Take Me Out a hit.  And oddly enough, the start of Evil and a Heathen sounds exactly like the Theme to 9 to 5. <br /> <br />When the band slows things down, such on Eleanor Put Your Boots On, they come across sounding like a Beatles cover band, except the lead singer, Alex Kapranos, sound as if he can't decide whether he wants to channel Lennon or Dylan.  Fade Together, another slow one, sounds like something out of the Beatles psychedelic phase.  But if you take out the slow songs that drag down the album, you will have something to party to until at least the New Year.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold's first novel!  I can't wait for more.  Like Charles Frasier's first novel, Cold Mountain, this novel is emotionally  captivating.  The impact of her death influences all who knew her to differing degrees, as in real life, beginning, of course, with her immediate family, whom she sees disintegrate with the stress her death causes them.  I felt certain sections toward the end fell somewhat flat, but I wasn't expecting to read a perfect novel.  This was one of a few books I've read that had an impact on me for days afterward.  I highly recommend it.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Rain Man is a classic film with global appeal but certainly the one that propelled awareness of autism into the mainstream.  At the same time it failed to give the public a full sense of the diversity of people on the autistic spectrum, most of who do not have savant skills at all and many of whom are not at all wooden or shuffling like Raymond in this film.  But what Rain Man did do was give people an understanding of some of the challenges of autism and paved the way for a far wider public reception of the literary works of people with autism (Nobody Nowhere, Emergence, Lucy's Story etc) which generally went on to challenge the existing stereotypes with the consequence that the incidence of autism was seen to explode from 1 in 10,000 to around 1 in 160 people today.  Cruise and Hoffman are outstanding in this film and the story of the opportunistic and image conscious Cruise contrasted with the 'what you see is what you get' Hoffman is gorgeous.  Its a film that mirrors the best and worst of human beings in modern society and in this sense stretches far beyond autism.
0446677450|1.0|This book is full of stories that tell you the same message, over and over again. We get the point, give us some practical tips and steps to achieve the goals.  I did not find the book helpful at all, I learned very little in terms of practical financial knowlege.  The first chapter got the message across, the rest are just fillers.  I found David Bach's Automatic Millioniare and other books in his series much more useful.
6305428298|5.0|A stormingly brilliant film that blends the best of Billy Elliot with Amelie whilst coming close to the fringes of an Autism flick.  The main character, LV, is agoraphobic, socially phobic, more or less echolalic in her capacity to mimic brilliantly any singer and somewhat selectively mute.  She also comes very close to someone with high functioning autism or Asperger's without ever labouring the point of disability or labels in any way.  That's whats so marvellous about this film, its story, its writing, its direction, its acting... seriously, can't praise this one highly enough.  Michael Caine is fabulous, gritty and brilliantly annoying. Brenda Blethyn is fantastic as his appaling side-kick beastly mother to LV.  Jane Horrocks as LV is an incredible talent and her performance of LV stands up to the standard of Hoffman in Rain Man without a problem.  She is astounding here.  And its an entertaining, informative, captivating and ultimately highly enjoyable film.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Franz is back. Just as we had nearly forgotten the hype from their \\"Franz Ferdinand\\" debut, they release yet another album to keep their buzz alive. In such a short time, for a relatively young band, it is only natural that they would follow up on their winning-formula with another dose of upbeat pop/rock. Good news for fans; Franz Ferdinand is the same band as they were when they last left us.   The album starts off with the incredibly catchy \\"fallen; which leaves the lines \\"For the fallen walk among us - Walk among us\\" lingering in your head. Their single, the next song, \\"Do You want to\\" is no masterpiece; it is a fun-loving, simple dance piece. In fact these words can find meaning as a description for the entire album. Franz Ferdinand offers nothing revolutionary to the world of rock. Rather, they have thus far produced two solid, easy-to-love pieces of upbeat material. To credit the band, Franz has grown a bit since their last album. \\"You Could Have it So Much Better\\" delivers on this fun pop/rock theme more confidently and effortlessly than did their debut.     Rating: 8.0/10.0
B00003CXA2|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite films.  If you liked The Fisher King and The World According To Garp you'll probably love Forrest Gump.    Like Garp, Forrest Gump follows the life of boy into man but never labours the point here about Forrest's disabilities which is one of the really cult aspects of this film.  Forrest is allowed to shine as an eccentric and wonderful character with a real life in which, whilst his disabilities get in the way, the same disabilities equally save him and those around him on a multitude of levels.  But don't think disability equals tragedy.  This film will catapult you equally into as many laughs as tears.  If you like the rollercoaster effect, this is your film.  Nothing drags here and you are not let off the hook till the feather floats again at the end of the film.  Its almost not a film but trully a filmic piece of art.  Astounding.
068987474X|1.0|I confess: I fell for this. Like any aging woman who wants a \\"hip\\" backup to her own motherly advice, I thought a catchy title and two well-connected authors would cement the solid advice she'd been dispensing for years. Reality check: well-connected authors in the secular world didn't make their connections by attaching themselves to chastity, modesty, or virtue in general. Those are the people still out in the cold, knocking patiently on the sealed doors to the mass media. Those on the inside are there because they have joined in the chorus, belting out tunes that praise the sexual revolution. Silly me.<br /><br />Somehow, because they are suffering from the inadequacies inherent in adolescence and are yearning to be loved, young girls often miss important cues from the men in their lives. They overlook key defects and ignore telling traits, seeing only good intentions and banking on vague promises. This generation isn't unique in this regard, but the disintegration of the family means fewer women have fathers who are careful to form them and pay attention to their romantic adventures, and there is a greater sense of independence overall from parental oversight in the best of circumstances. Young people navigate the waters of courtship and love with little moral formation and less respect for convention. It is a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />These two authors, both associated with the hit television series \\"Sex and the City,\\" teamed up to fight the overwhelming trend they witnessed: women pining over losers who had no intention of trying to make them happy. The chapters are rife with entertaining anecdotes under amazingly obvious titles: He's just not that into you ... If he's not asking you out. ... If he's not calling you, ... If he's not dating you, ... If he's disappeared on you, ... If he's a selfish jerk, ... If he only wants to see you when he's drunk. How obtuse can women possibly be? Is all of this really necessary? Sadly, Yes.<br /><br />With even the questionable dating habits that parents and grandparents went through in the last fifty years, we now have \\"serious\\" relationships based on email, instant messaging, hooking up at assigned locations, and cell phone contact (messages, conversations, and graphic pictures). Real human contact - let's call it eye-to-eye contact - is minimal, and parental involvement may be non-existent despite the best of intentions. Children are loose and on the market from a very young age and the peer advice they get is akin to the \\"blind leading the blind.\\" From the fact that this book has been a \\"New York Times #1 Bestseller,\\" we can assume that young women are in a real quandary trying to figure out why they're not getting commitment - or even a modicum of respect.<br /><br />Chapter Four is the key. This is the answer to why there is little commitment and even less wisdom in picking up the cues about where true affections lie. These two saucy and hip authors toss their readers the \\"truism\\" that takes them down the black hole: \\"He's just not that into you if he's not having sex with you.\\" Yes, dear readers, you read that right. In their logic, they explain:<br /><br />Ladies, you are going to meet, and have already met, many, many men in the years that constitute your dating lifespan. And I hate to tell you this, but some of these men will simply not be attracted to you. I know you're hot, but that's just the way it is... If he were into you, he would be having a hard time keeping his paws off you. Oh the simplicity of it all! If a man is not trying got undress you, he's not into you.<br /><br />Then they go on to fielding several protestations about nice guys who don't seem to be this way, which they put down adamantly. Sex is a gift, a right to be enjoyed, they insist, and if your man isn't offering it, it's a very bad sign and you must move on.<br /><br />Is this said earnestly? Jokingly? Sincerely? While laughing up their sleeves? I don't know, but there it is - which explainsthe moral vacuum, the blindness, the myopia, the folly. If this is the standard by which women are to connect with men, then it's no wonder that they are more impaired and abused than any generation of their sisters previously. (Even the \\"flower children\\" knew what they were flaunting and where the moral bar lay.) Contemporary children are surrounded by decadence, with what used to be fringe now parading everywhere as mainstream culture.<br /><br />If sexual intimacy is inherent in all male-female relationships in order to prove \\"I care,\\" then men will be depraved and irresponsible and women will be spiritually and emotionally bankrupt. It's that simple. With the physiological bonding that takes place in women during intercourse, they are serially severing their senses from their being, and fragmenting their very souls. When a woman has to spend $30 on a book for a complete stranger to tell her that the man who abandoned he doesn't care about her, she is beyond confused, she is a blind and irrational soul.<br /><br />Here's the popular culture, arrayed in snazzy colours, stating the obvious to the oblivious. I took the bait, and found that the \\"cure\\" contains poison - not like an antibody to save, but like a nice refreshing glass of water laced with a deadly dose of arsenic. We have to face this message head-on and explain why it is wrong. We cannot afford delicacy on this issue - the darkness lies over this world like a mist and we owe our daughters at least a lamp. Without it, they will be swallowed before our very eyes.<br /><br />[...]ins the moral vacuum, the blindness, the myopia, the folly.

B00004Y6NW|5.0|I really love this CD. One of the very best. Definately <br />worth a rock collection. My favorite songs are Down to the <br />Waterline, Sultans of Swing, & Lions. I will recommend Making <br />Movies & On Every Street in addition to this since I love all <br />those albums.
B00003CXWV|5.0|George Jung is not your typical drug lord.  And Blow is not your typical drug-bust movie.  This film neither glorifies nor criticizes drugs; it simply shows you the rise and fall of a drug lord's empire.  Although it still condones the idea that \\"if you deal drugs, it won't end well,\\" you can't help but like George Jung, the main character.   <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Blow tells the story of George Jung, an American boy born into a middle-class family in the 70's with dreams of breaking away from the blue-collar struggle.  George, played by Johnny Depp, and his accomplice/best friend, Tuna, begin their adventure by smuggling large amounts of marijuana from the west coast to the east coast.  After doing time for a bust in Chicago, George elevates his ambitions to smuggling cocaine into hijacked airplanes across the border of Mexico.  In fact, he acted as an innovator by introducing America to Columbian cocaine.  He became a legendary cocaine kingpin, climbing his way to the top.  In his venture for fortune, Jung is faced with decisions that will inevitably result in his ruin.   <br /> <br />At the end of the movie, you are left to wonder if the protagonist, Jung, is a criminal or a hero?  Although Jung made poor decisions, and he must face the music, you're left with the feeling of regret and sympathy for him.  In many ways, Jung was simply trying to live the American dream-rising from poverty to fortune. Jung was a businessman, merely pushing a product that the era welcomed with open arms.   To quote the real George Jung himself, \\"I felt that there was nothing wrong with what I was doing because I was supplying a product to people that wanted it and it was accepted.\\"  It really makes you question the morality of Jung.  The events that seemed the most \\"wrong\\" were not that of his drug trafficking, but that of his friends, partners, mother, and wife betraying him throughout his life. Drugs are peripheral in this movie.  I feel that Jung lost himself in thewealth and power that the world of cocaine introduced him to.  His ambitions blinded him from the important things in life, such as his daughter.  He simply went too far.  Perhaps it was not the drugs he was addicted to, but rather, the prosperity of his drug career.    <br /> <br />The supporting characters were complex and intriguing, making the film more real.  George's father, a hard-working and devoted man, stands by George in his ups and downs, despite the fact that he disagrees with his son's career choice.  George's money-driven mother seems like no match for his father.  The woman George eventually marries, Mirtha, is a replica of his mother.  She is a crazed, money-hungry firecracker, responsible for one of his arrests.  In fact, there is a scene in the movie where George and Mirtha are fighting in front of their daughter that mirrors that of a fight his parents had in front of him.  His friends start out as likable characters.  Tuna, his lifelong friend, remains true to George, but eventually fades into the wild lifestyle.  Diego, Derek, and Pablo all seem like loyal partners at first, but they all eventually betray him.  It is because of them that his final bust took place, putting him in prison for 60 years.  These characters, especially Diego, are the type of conniving criminals who come to mind when you think of \\"drug dealers,\\" not Jung. <br /> <br />At the end of the film, you are left to question the moral of the story.  By portraying the life of George Jung is the filmmaker inadvertently saying, \\"if you deal drugs, this is what happens?\\"  It seems doubtful considering Ted Demme, the director, died of drug overdose shortly after his film was released.  However, I think the old saying holds true for this movie.  The bigger you are, the harder you fall.  As Jung said, \\"Sometimes you're flush and sometimes you're bust, and when you're up, it's never as good as it seems, and when you're down, you never think you'll be up again, but life goes on.\\" <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|Yes it's true.  Paul's new \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" is his best and finest solo album (in my opinion of course).  This is an album of 13 outstanding songs, all of them excellently played and sung, Paul playing practically all the instruments.  In fact, \\"Chaos and Creation\\" stands up nicely to many of the Beatles albums in that all the songs are really, really good.  Each song has an individual gem-like quality.  There are a couple of rockers \\"Fine Line\\", \\"Promise to You\\"; a number where he's channeling George \\"Friends to Go\\"; a number where's he's channeling John \\"How Kind of You\\".  There are beautiful melodies throughout.  And the instrumentation is Brian Wilson-like in its beauty and complexity.  (Did I mention Paul plays most of the instruments?)  Though it's mostly an upbeat work, there's a very strong under current of melancholy.  It's a very spiritual album too, especially \\"Anyway\\" with its achingly beautiful melody or the lovely \\"Jenny Wren\\".  That instrumental chord passage in \\"At the Mercy\\" after the word \\"explode\\" is simply astounding.  This is one of the most \\"Beatle-y\\" albums Paul has released.  I've enjoyed \\"Band on the Run\\", \\"Ram\\", \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" and most of Paul's solo work.  But THIS album will really get under your skin and into your subconscious.  You'll be hooked after 2 or 3 spins.
1572523166|5.0|I think he's probably one of the few unique performers of his genre.  He could actually just stand on stage in one of his elaborate costumes and most of us would be mesmerized, back in his day of course.  I remember going to this movie when it first came out and had to see it just because he was in it.  There are no CGI effects at all, just something that is seriously lacking in most movies now, a simple story.  I remember crying when he pulled out that living camera and saw his family dying on screen he realizes he'll never see them alive or ever get back to his planet again.  Very powerful and sad.  This movie isn't for every one it is slow and paced and not very noisy.  But if you like something different give this one a try.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Through the years, Manson has turned heads of critics and listeners alike with his vulgar lyrics and amazing, hard-hitting instrumental accompanyment.  Antichrist Superstar is the epitome of Manson's talent.  This album not only holds great songs but shows the band's/singer's versatility.  Slower songs like Tourniquet and Reflecting God are offset by the harder pounding classics like Irresponsible Hate Anthem and of course, Beautiful People.  In this CD, the listener can also see just how much progress Manson has made lyrically since Portrait of an American Family.  After buying this album, I haven't regretted spending the money once.
0060254920|5.0|Our nine-month-old has been read to ever since he was three months.  We have just \\"re-discovered\\" Where The Wild Things Are, and enjoy it immensely.<br /><br />It reminds me of my own childhood, similar to countless other previous reviewers.  For myself, however, it wasn't a book we actually had around the house.  Doubtlessly I remember it from a public library reading or elsewhere.<br /><br />The pictures are so intricate and the colours are vibrant, but yet subdued.  When we reach the three pages of the \\"rumpus\\" (in which there are no words, only pictures), I like to leave it that way, and not comment on the scenery to the child, but just turn the pages very slowly in silence, watching him gaze at the pictures.<br /><br />This book enjoys ongoing popularity.  Recently it's been reviewed on Amazon every couple of days!  Little wonder, as it is a joy and an inspiration to young and old (and in between) alike.<br /><br />Another favourite of ours you may like to try is The Monster at the End of this Book Starring Lovable, Furry Old Grover (ISBN: 0-307-16025-4).  It is (backcover) \\"...the bestselling Sesame Street book of all time...\\"
B000B0WODA|5.0|Finally some group that is able to bring more than one good album. <br />And they don't lack intelligence too. Mainly all artists are caugt on the crossroad after a good debut - will they do more of the same music which occasionaly gets boring, or will they do something new and disappoint the majority of fans. Well, Kapranos and company  found a new formula - they did both on the same album and they did it good. Don't expect the almost perfect album as the first one was, but at least 10 of 13 song are very good. <br /> <br />The Fallen - more of the same old dance style, one of the better tracks 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Do You Want To - very similar to \\"Take me out\\" but always different 5/5 <br /> <br />This Boy - more of the same style 3/5 <br /> <br />Walk Away - wow, a new style, more like combination rock'n'roll and easy rock ballad - their best song so far 5/5 <br /> <br />Evil And A Heathen - less dancing and more like punk, but in their old style, not bad 3.5/5 <br /> <br />You're The Reason I'm Leaving - their reckognizable style mixed with rock'n'roll rhythm in the background on the refrain, one of the better songs 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Eleanor Put Your Boots On - well this is soething new, an easy ballad that will remind you of Beatles and Paul McCartney, well done boys 5/5 <br /> <br />Well That Was Easy - quick rhythm, old style, a good song 4/5 <br /> <br />What You Meant - same style like the past one but more suitable for dancing 4.5/5 <br /> <br />I'm Your Villain - you won't like this one at the first hearing but it is a good song indeed, somehow powerful. You'll hear a little bit of everything in it, punk, dancing riffs, drums and folk,  4/5 <br /> <br />You Could Have It So Much Better - this is almost pure punk, and nice done too 4/5 <br /> <br />Fade Together - the easiest song they have done so far. If you know who Brian Eno is, mix him with Beatles and you'll get the picture. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Outsiders - a good intro riff and not very good after that, but more you hear it, more you're gonna like it 3/5 <br />  <br /> <br />You have certainly noticed there aren't any grades below 3 and they deserve it. I would rate this album 4.5 but it isn't possible and they certainly deserve more then 4/5. You could have it so much better .... with this album.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I may get a lot of flack for even suggesting this, but I do think season 2 was better than 1. My main reasons are that the characters were all sort of pushed to their limits. Starting off with Marissa in the first episode, throwing her chair into the pool because she's so heartbroken and angry, and ending with the breakdown of one of the strongest characters on the show, Kirsten. Sandy and Kirsten's marriage was challenged on multiple fronts; Julie was nearly taken down, but showed her true self when Caleb had the heart attack; Poor Seth was so heartbroken for most of the season but he came back strong, and finally Ryan faced difficult challenges after spending a year trying to be a better person. I thought it was just a more interesting season all around.

B000069AUI|5.0|AROBTTH offers a plethora of varying moods, beats, and sounds. A sampling: <br /> <br /> <br />Politik: 10/10--A pounding, politically charged opener that connects with the listener's moral compass. Best lyric: Wounds that heal and cracks that fix/Tell me your own politik/And open up your eyes... <br /> <br />In My Place: 9/10--An emotive ballad of soul-searching permeated by an infectious keyboard/guitar riff. <br /> <br />God Put a Smile: 8/10--Vibrant beat helps explore the uncertainty surrounding death. Best lyric: Where do we go, nobody knows/Don't ever say you're on your way down when/God gave you style and gave you grace/And put a smile upon your face <br /> <br />The Scientist: 10/10--Heart-rending tale of love lost; great chorus but stick around for the extended guitar climax, a perfect lead-in for Clocks. <br /> <br />Clocks: 10/10--The definitive showstopper--piano on steroids. Opening lyric: Lights go out and I can't be saved/Tides that I tried to swim against/Have brought me down upon my knees/Oh I beg, I beg and plead <br /> <br />Daylight: 9/10--Psychodelic dichotomy of Druid-like chanting and warm bursts of energy builds to an intoxicating refrain of \\"slowly breaking through the daylight.\\" <br /> <br />Green Eyes: 8/10--Folksy, acoustic ode to that special someone. <br /> <br />Warning Sign: 10/10--Simply perfect, from extended instrumental intro through aching verses to soothing finale. <br /> <br />A Whisper: 7/10--An ironically loud, jarring presence in the setlist, but its cryptic (mostly unintelligible) lyrics give it a certain allure. <br /> <br />A Rush of Blood: 9/10--Dense, somber look into human instincts toward war and retribution. Best lyric: Some will laugh and some just sit and cry/But you just sit down there and you wonder why <br /> <br />Amsterdam: 10/10--Gorgeous piano for perfect closer about redemption.  Best lyric: Come on, oh my star is fading/And I see no chance of release/I know I'm dead on the surface/But I am screaming underneath

I think this is a good collection but i have had ALMOST every one of these songs on my computer for a longgg time.. and when i saw the track listing i was really hoping for them to either re-do them in the studio or remaster them,(I.E. Be Quiet and Drive Acoustic). I havent watched the DVD yet but u can get the deftones videos anywhere, granted theres little tid bits in between.. i was hoping for some live songs. Lastly theres some good songs missing i wish they would have included: Like everyone before said \\"To Have And To Hold\\" and \\"Lovers\\", but also my favorite cover they do: Weezer's Say It Aint So.    <br /> <br />So i give the tones cd 4 stars but i think it could have been a little better. Its too boot-leggy for the money, but still a definite must have for any REAL deftones fan <br /> <br />CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW ALBUM!!!!!!
B000008HPE|5.0|Hey, Paul?!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I really love all the songs in \\"Under My Skin\\". It's not the kind of album where you pick out a few songs and the rest are junk. It's got style and attitude, which matters a lot in music. Avril Lavigne is definately not just a random wannabe.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I have never watched the firefly season dvd , as a matter of fact thats why I am here on amazon so I can buy it because after seeing the movie Serenity , I am in love with this franchise and I eagerly look foward to watching the full season series. You don't need to have seen the dvd of firefly as I went in cold and had no trouble knowing whats going on as the movie takes care of all of that for you in the first 20 mins or so. Do yourself a favor , go see this movie..if you like sci fi then go see it and support sci fi movies as when studios see movies like this one succeed they will support more sci fi movies and tv shows.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Is Batman begins. It relies a little too much on heavy handed action sequences (like a Chuck Norris film or recent James Bond movie). But it does have pretty good story and I love the way the guy with the mask is such a non-cartoon like villain so unlike any bad guy we saw in Burton's or Schumacher's Batman films or the 60's Batman series with Adam west. Also, I like the way the guy playing the cop in the film is no macho stud (like Tom Selleck) but is still allowed to be heroic. I also like the brief scene with the loose women and the pool.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is the best music I have heard in a long time.  Enjoyed it very much.
B000002H1T|5.0|The Cars were one of the premiere New Wave bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Their debut CD (\\"The Cars\\") and brilliant single, \\"Just What I Needed,\\" introduced an entire generation to New Wave.  That single is simply one of the best songs ever recorded.  Each subsequent release built upon that legacy.  However, 1984's \\"Heartbeat City\\" was an entirely different animal - perhaps more \\"pop\\" than New Wave.  The CD turned off many of the faithful, but it also won them a ton of new converts and went triple platinum in the process.<br /><br />The first single, \\"You Might Think,\\" was vintage Cars and peaked at #7, becoming their second Top 10 single; \\"Shake It Up\\" was their first in 1982.  The video, which starred Ric Ocasek's wife Paulina Porizkova, was also very popular; in fact, it won the first MTV VMA for Video of the Year.  \\"Magic\\" was the second single and was definitely more pop sounding - it peaked at #12.  What changed their careers was the third single: \\"Drive.\\"  The song became their biggest hit, driving to #3 in late 1984.  The vocals were handled by Benjamin Orr instead of Ric Ocasek, and the song is an uncharacteristic, beautiful ballad.  They returned to their New Wave roots for the fourth single, \\"Hello Again\\" (peaking at #20), and then released a final ballad, \\"Why Can't I Have You\\" (peaking at #33).<br /><br />Hardcore fans of the Cars often dislike \\"Heartbeat City,\\" much as \\"Combat Rock\\" is hated by many Clash faithful.  It made them one of the biggest bands in the world at the time, but it also sounded so different from their prior CDs.  \\"Heartbeat City\\" was the first Cars' music that I purchased, so I will always feel positively toward it.  However, as I've gotten further into the Cars' catalog, I have to admit that it's not as rich or consistent as some of their other releases, particularly 1978s peerless \\"The Cars.\\"  Overall, I recommend \\"Heartbeat City\\" for the extraordinary singles, but if you like this CD, followup with some of their earlier releases as well.earlier releases as well. <br />
B000B0WODA|5.0|I just bought the sucker this morning off of iTunes and all I can say is damn - that's some good music.  Right now, I'm at home sick and when I listened to the first cut all the way through, I wanted to get up and dance, it's so much fun.

B0009WFFS6|3.0|I was crossing my fingers about this one and was not dissappointed. Should be 5 stars (the Amazon rating system somehow fouled up on me). This DVD captures Cream like we had dreamed of seeing them. Although some of the youthful energy is gone (NSU, for instance), it is more than made up by experience, the result being that they have become the seasoned blues/jazzmen they strove for in their heyday. I was struck by the fact that, being a big Clapton fan, songs I had not expected would impact on me did so the most; i.e. Baker's Pressed Rat and Warthog and Bruce's tour de force on Muddy's Rollin' and Tumblin' (with his harp and EC's slide work a searing rendition). Ginger's Toad confirms the fact that his strength lay in supreme skill and not the brute force of many who followed his footsteps. What's so cool about this version of Cream is the fact that they did nor return to the Marshall stack/SG/OB3 instrumentation, but realized a new sound based on their current instrument tastes which, although providing a nod to the past, gives the band a contemporary edge. Although, apart from his trusty OB1 bass, Jack relied on a selection of contemporary gear. EC utilized a strat and a pair of Fender tweeds. As the original Marshalls were designed, in part, as a British take on the Fender Bassman, he was able to achieve the fat \\"woman tone\\" distortion we are all familiar with and yet color the sound with thinner tones when needed. The only other equipment I noticed was the leslie cabinet (for Badge, of course).. Cream was always about taste in songwriting, playing and singing. This Cream's improvisation, although being as supberb as in the past, is taughter and more economical and is due to, in large part, their maturity as musicians. If you looked closely at the audience, you could see, among others, Brian May and (could that be?)Jimmy Page closely watching these veterans improvise. I thought, however, that shots of \\"Hollywood celebrities\\" during some songs (however brief), diddivert the attention from where it belonged (the stage). The interviews are honest and heart rending. Age truly has mellowed these personalities somewhat. We all love this band, admire the players and are just grateful they have reunited (as EC said, they are lucky they can reform at this age and perform at such a level). The opening song, \\"I'm so glad\\" says it all. Well done. boys!! The video and sound quality is wonderful. Now...for us fanatics, please release a multiple disk set including all performances recorded in Britain, as well as the upcoming New York shows. Upon watching this concert, I promptly went online and purchased a ticket for one of the New York performances. I'll be cheering you on at the Gardens on Oct. 25th.  <br />
B0000009SM|5.0|One Size fits All is one of Uncle Frank's finest moments. Along with his 'Mother's of Invention', FZ captures the ultimate fusion between jazz, rock, and Zappa's special blend of comedy and biting humor.<br /><br />It's been many years, but I believe this may be the first exposure to Zappa I ever had and I've never looked back. Po'jama People had me hooked. Only Frank can write this kind of subject matter. He is so sorely missed by his fans. Can't Afford no Shoes is another catchy number that you'll catch yourself singing as are stopped at a red light. The people next to you will think you're nuts.<br /><br />The song this album is most known for is probably San Berdeno. It's a great tune about a girl in love with the boy from the rodeo. His name is Bobby and he looks like a potato. If you have never heard this song (or this album), you are missing out on a wonderful experience. Some people cannot handle Franks 20 minute instrumentals, but this album is great for people with shorter attention spans. Inca Roads is an instrumental, but it's more radio friendly than some of his other works.<br /><br />All in all, if you are new to Frank Zappa I highly recommend this album before venturing out deeper into more complicated works like Joe's Garage or Thing Fish.
0440237688|4.0|A twelve year old boy named Jonas has the perfect life.  He is never hungry, never has to deal with war, and he never has any reason to believe that something is wrong with his life and the society that he lives in.  When Jonas is picked to be the Receiver of Memories, he embarks on a dangerous and exciting journey.  Jonas begins to learn the truth about his society, and what is kept hidden from public view.  He realizes the hypocrisy that he has to deal with everyday, and he learns that maybe the world isn't so perfect anymore.  What will Jonas do with his new knowledge? <br /> I thought The Giver was a great book.  It is the only book of its kind to portray a perfect Utopian society realistically.  Lois Lowry uses her colorful writing skills to create life-like characters that everyone can relate to and an exciting plot with surprises at every turn.  I would recommend this book as a good read for anyone who is into science fiction with a twist.        <br />
B00005JO0J|5.0|A TV show fails to make it an entire season, gets released in its entirety on DVD, and generates a word of mouth buzz that encourages writer Joss Whedon to write a movie script.  The buzz and sales of the DVD were good enough to get studio execs to not only listen but to let Whedon do the show his way.  Welcome to Serenity.<br /><br />Serenity is the name of the ship our heroes are gallivanting the galaxy in.  Heroes is almost too strong a word as we see that they are a bunch of outlaws.  Like most westerns though (that's right western), the good guys are in a shade of grey.  Self preservation and profit tops their priorities, but when the chips are down Mal, the captain, and his crew cannot help but to do the right thing.<br /><br />What makes this movie truly great is not the plot (although a very high point), but the characters.  You truly grow to love the characters and the relationships they have with each other.  The sexual tension between the characters, most fans of the series are already familiar with, is made apparent without flat out telling the audience that it is supposed to be there.  The characters fall back into their roles from the series effortlessly, and it is obvious that they have worked with each other a lot.  The characters are not one dimensional, they have complex reasons for what they do and you get to see them weighing their options on screen.  The crew reacts not as individuals, but as family.  Which is exactly what you would get with a small group of people in such proximity for such a long time.<br /><br />Now on to the plot.  The story centers around the character of River (Summer Glaus), a telepath that was made that way by the alliance, the governing body of the solar system.  Her brother, Simon, breaks her out of the hospital where the alliance is performing the experiments.  The TV show, Firefly started at this point.  The movie starts at a much later point after Simon and River have been on the ship for about a year.  The alliance is out to silence River and whatever government secrets she may know.<br /><br />The story was the easy part and could be redone in any number of action movies, but the relationship that the characters have with each other make this a marvel.  The dialogue is fresh and funny.  The graphics are clean and beautiful.  This movie has been deemed the new Star Wars and for good reasons.  This is the Movie that Lucas wanted episode III to be, this is the chemistry that was absent between Padme and Anakin.  Serenity is the torch bearer for all new science fiction.  Joss Whedon and the thespians, yes thespians, that played their roles have raised the standard by which all scifi shall henceforth be judged,  Serenity is to Movies, what Battlestar Galactica and Lost are to TV.is out to silence River and whatever government secrets she may know.<br /><br />The story was the easy part and could be redone in any number of action movies, but the relationship that the characters have with each other make this a marvel.

B00004XMSN|5.0|This genlte film, based on Robert Nathan's fine story, has the warmth of a cup of hot cider by the fireplace during a cold December day. There is something quiet and magical about it, like the hush of the world when it snows. Cary Grant and Loretta Young are a joy to watch together, their easy chemistry as welcome as popcorn balls and candy canes.<br /><br />Directed by Henry Koster, with some nice photography from Gregg Toland, the screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood and Leonardo Bercovici captures perfectly the sentimental fantasy feel of all Robert Nathan's fine work. Cary Grant convinced producer Samuel Goldwyn to let him portray the role of Dudley rather than the bishop, and after seeing this film, it would be difficult to imagine it any other way.<br /><br />Cary Grant always made everything look easy, but just how much work went into that illusion is exemplified by this film. Before shooting began, Grant could not ice skate, play the harp, or speak any French. By the time \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" was finished shooting, he could do all three. It was truly an accomplishment of heavenly preportions. The film itself was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Picture, and received another nomination for Best Director.<br /><br />Henry Brogham (David Niven) is a newly appointed Episcopalian bishop trying to secure funds for a big cathedral he wants to build. He is selling out little by little to the demands of Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), who helped get him his appointment and has the money he needs to make his dream come true. But he has forgotten about his wife's happiness in his quest to build the massive church, and when he prays for direction from God, he gets more than he bargained for.<br /><br />Cary Grant is the Angel, Dudley, who's been sent to help out. Cars stop for him and he knows the name of everyone he meets before they tell him. Dudley is quiet and charming, and very handsome. He has an easy way about him that makes everyone happy. Henry's maid, Matilda (Elsa Lanchester), is taken with him and he has a gentle effect on everyone he comes in contact with. Henry is not as ecstatic about Dudley, however, since one of those people is his neglected wife, Julia (Loretta Young).<br /><br />Young looks beautiful framed by Gregg Toland's soft focus photography, and is marvelous as the sweet woman who misses the time Henry spent with she and their daughter, Debby (Karolyn Grimes), before he obtained his appointment. Dudley and Julia begin to enjoy the small and wonderful things a couple in love should share together, while Henry continues to fret over the cathedral. Henry has forgotten that he prayed for guidance, not a big church.<br /><br />It is snowing all through this film, and there are many sweet moments between Dudley and Julia. Just the simple pleasure of a walk down the street and having lunch at a familiar place are given back to Julia, as she is made to feel appreciated again. She finally splurges and buys the hat she's been staring at through the shop window for weeks. It is a moment of self-worth, restored by Dudley's attention. There is a magical ice-skating scene as Dudley makes it possible for Julia to glide like an old hand over the ice.<br /><br />There is humor as well, Dudley making Debby's snowballs hit their mark. He also gives Sylvester (James Gleason), the cab driver, the ability to skate. Dudley explains to Julia that the only people who grow old are those who are born old, but if you are born young, you will stay that way. Dudley and Julia restore Sylvester's faith in people.<br /><br />Dudley's gentle effect on people, however, is not limited to Julia. His visit to Mrs. Hamilton will reveal a secret love from her past and change her plans for Henry's cathedral. His visit with Julia's friend, Professor Wutheridge (Monty Woolley), will inspire him to write his book and understand what he could not before. And all the time he is spending with Julia and Debby may make Henry angry enough to realize whatis really important, if it is not too late.<br /><br />There is a tender charm to this heartwarming classic. You will find yourself smiling a lot while watching it. Some nice music by Hugo Friedhofer and the Mitchell Boychoir add to a very special atmosphere. \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is a reminder that it is people that matter, not a building, and the charity we give, should always begin at home, with those we love. It is a wonderful message we can heed all year long.der charm to this heartwarming classic. You will find yourself smiling a lot while watching it.

B000005DQR|4.0|a groundbreaking (at the time of it's release) album utilizing a more \\"electronica\\" feel for it's hip hop blueprint. the and eerie numbers are my favorite, but the upbeat selections show a great skill and creativity.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|There are two movies that people who don't know John Waters and the types of films he normally makes always love.  Cry Baby and Hairspray contain both John Water's sense of humor and style, but don't necessarily dig into the depths of depravity (like eating dog poo) some of his more subversive films do.  I'm not a John Waters aficionado yet, but what I've noticed in his films is that they normally center around two opposite sides that will eventually come crashing into one another.  From Hairspray to A Dirty Shame, the films do a great job of putting two sides in direct opposition to each other and then letting the fur fly. <br /> <br />Cry Baby is no different.  In this case, the Drapes and the Squares square off (pun not-intended) with Johnny Depp's Wade and Amy Locane's Allison at the center.  Basically a love story that draws on the same dichotomous split seen in Romeo and Juliet, you have the poor and rowdy meet the rich and on the surface proper.  What follows is a funny and zany ride as the two sides end up colliding in a winner-take-all car chase.   <br /> <br />The writing is sharp as is the directing.  What I admire about Waters the most is his ability to create vivid characters with personality.  Sometimes he relies heavily on stereotypes, but each character is his or her own.  You won't ever confuse them.  They stay sharp, even when the acting isn't exactly stellar.  The acting, like a majority of John Water's films, is spotty.  Its done in an over-the-top sort of way that you can't help but laugh at.  It reminds you that this isn't real and that you shouldn't take it seriously.  Water's employs not only great upcoming talent (like Depp) but also people like Hatchet Face who haven't been seen much in film since.  All do a great job playing their roles; however, not all of them are good actors.   <br /> <br />Once you look past this minor speed bump, the ride is hillarious.  It, along with Hairspray, is probably the most accessible of John Water's films.It maintains his sharp satirical writing and funny dialogue, but keeps the humor bawdy but not excessive.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|This is the debut album by a very young band from Tennessee.  Singer Hayley Williams is only 16 years old, and, judging from the band's website forum, most of its fans so far are teenagers.  But this album should significantly broaden the band's appeal; it's earnest emo in the vein of Jimmy Eat World or Armor for Sleep, but less dark and more poppy.  The production is clean, the choruses are memorable, and hooks are aplenty.  Williams' confident vocals belie her youth, and, having already scored a slot on this year's Warped Tour, the band looks set for bigger and better things ahead.
0517543052|5.0|Maharaji, Ram Dass's guru, said this book was his \\"Ashirabad\\" or blessing. The ripple effect of this singular work has likely created greater modern acceptance of yoga & meditation in the West than any other.  <br /> <br />Clearly a product of its era, \\"Be Here Now\\" combines Alpert's metamorphosis into Ram Dass, a free-wheeling survey on the possibilities of transformation, and a cookbook outlining sustainable methodologies dating back thousands of years, which are just as effective today when applied correctly.  <br /> <br />Despite the cynicism of our consumer culture, there is such a thing as \\"perfect timing\\", as well as the reality - more familiar in the East - of the \\"Guru's Grace\\". As a seminal work that has inspired millions, \\"Be Here Now\\" stands the test of time as a classic example of both.   <br /> <br />
1400034779|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the characters. I think that the author did a wonderful job bringing the words to life.  It is a mystery, yet not as much \\"who dun it\\" as figuring out the intricacies of others lives, which Mm. Ramostswe does with such class and humor. <br />This is the second time I've read this book and I think I enjoyed even better the second time.  A must read for those who just like a good entertaining book.
B000063DFN|5.0|For new fans or old fans of Iron Maiden this album is a must have. This album includes the songs \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\", \\"Aces High\\", Powerslave\\", \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\", \\"Flash Of The Blade\\" all songs that in my opinion are some of Iron Maidens best work. If you don't have this album and you love metal music buy it.
B000AARKOO|3.0|I simply cannot for the life of me understand the appeal of Orlando Bloom; he melts into the background of this film and I am convinced the only reason that he was remotely memorable in the LOTR series is because he was the only blonde male.  He is too softly boyish, almost wimpy, to be believable.  Zero charisma, zero magnetism, the exact opposite of Russell Crowe in the far superior 'Gladiator'.  I am sure that everyone saw this film as the one that would elevate him to the A list leading man status like 'Gladiator' did for Crowe, but it probably had the opposite effect, limiting his successful roles to movies where the target demographic is female, age 13-19.    Having said all that, I really wanted to like this film, and if someone, anyone, would have been in the title role it would have been far better.  The film looks terrific, and the subject matter is very interesting.  Liam Neeson was a bit of a let down though, I can almost imagine his agent talking to the producers; \\"Look, he does the mentor thing these days and thats it, take it or leave it.\\"  Still, there is enough here to be entertained for an hour or two, but one viewing would be enough for me.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|After hearing everyone talk about Oldboy in my East Asian Cinema class, I decided take the plunge and see it at the Nuart. I didn't know what to expect, which is probably a blessing; expectations can go a long way towards ruining a film.<br /><br />Dae-su, the protagonist, starts out as a useless drunk. Then, seemingly for no reason, he is held in a room for fifteen long years, left with only a television to entertain him. His meals come from a slot under his door, and every once and while he's knocked out with sleeping gas. When he wakes up, his hair has been cut and he's been given a shave. Through his TV, he learns that he is being charged with the murder of his wife. Someone clearly has revenge on his mind, but who? And for what purpose?<br /><br />Since the plot hinges on a central revelation, I won't say anything else about it. Instead, I'll talk about some standout scenes. In a cinematic moment that has become infamous already, Dae-su (who looks just beastly with hair teased within an inch of it's life) walks into a sushi bar after being released and asks to eat something \\"alive.\\" He chomps into a live octopus, but before he can finish, he faints, one tentacle still squirming. On a visceral level, I was repulsed. But then I remembered that this guy just missed out on more than a decade of living and just wanted to feel vital again. In some strange way, my heart went out to him.<br /><br />Eventually, Dae-su figures out where he was incarcerated. So great is his fury that he storms in without any forethought, armed only with a small hammer that he picks up along the way. In a long shot of a hallway, he does battle with his former jailers, displaying an emotion I can only categorize as \\"primal rage.\\" Even a knife in his back can't do much more than slow him down. What made the scene captivating was the fact that violence was used to highlight an emotion, rather than for mere shock value.<br /><br />If you have a strong stomach and a taste for black humor, you'd do well to see this movie.r, you'd do well to see this movie.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Franz Ferdinand enjoyed great success on thier first album, self titled debut that was magnificent. Many hits were created, and a deep fanbase was created. Many people woundered whether Franz Ferdinand would fall to the infamous sophomore slump. Many bands spend years and years writing thier songs and that is why thier first albums are so spectacular. Then when a studio wants a new album, they rush to write it and it isn't as good. Franz's second LP You Could Have It So Much Better is the total polar opposite.     In about a year after thier first LP release these guys came fresh off the bat with great new material. These Scottish revolutionaries return with a second album of smart guitar hooks, and amazing indie dance beats. Even though thier first single \\"Do You Want To\\" makes this album seem like it will be a more fast paced dance rock album, but it's not. There are moments of genuine contemplation in \\"Fade Together\\" and \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On.\\" There is magnificent balance that is strung together by these guys in this wounderful album.    You Could Have It So Much Better leaves you eager for more Franz, instead of concerned on where their careers are headed. Franz is taking over modern rock and roll and are rising stars, this album is great. Franz Ferdinand made music better indeed.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Finally, a real portrait of Dylan is presented in video, directed by known other than Martin Scorsese. The footage alone is worth the price for any Dylan fan. I've never seen early live Dylan like this before. But mostly, this paints a pretty good portrait of Dylan's personality, unlike much of what Dylan said to reporters which was usually nothing.  <br />Also, thought it was already somewhat known, Dylan doesn't intend to put a message in his songs, they write themselves from stream of consciousness. Joan Baez is interviewed about Dylan's writing habits. Dylan would sit for hours typing lyrics and then tell her he knew nothing of the contents.  <br />This further extends Dylan's talent and explains some of Dylan's erratic behaviour around reporters when probed with questions he can't answer.  <br />This is a great set with a 2 dvd feature length that documents the early  days of Dylan to his rise to fame in 1966.
B000021Y77|5.0|This DVD has been reviewed nearly 500 times so there's not too much that you can say that hasn't been said. One repeating theme is the movie's comparison to the \\"investment projects\\" of Hollywood. That Hollywood has the best technique, stars, cinematography, $s, and gimmicks is all true. What it often doesn't have is that sense of taking a chance. Lola does.<br /><br />The presence of a basic problem, lovers on a downward spiral, need not be examined. The consequences of THE ACT is ignored and in its place is the examination of the details of the turns and twists we make each day which brings us to THE ACT.<br /><br />We probably cannot alter what has happened, Tykwer theorizes. But what occurs to Lola and Manni is perhaps a lesson for the future. How small changes, doing small things differently can impact the result drastically. The 'inadvertant ripple in the pond theory.'<br /><br />I found it to be a smart movie, smarter than most created on the West Coast, provocative, out of the box, with an eye towards embracing 'the what if we make just one change' question. It's no wonder it has become an international cult film with an enormous truly diverse following. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
0671027344|5.0|I chose this book because it had the most interesting title on the current Challenged and Band Books list published by the National Library Association.  I went into it knowing only what was said on the back cover.  At first I thought that the device of writing the book through letters would get old fast.  I quickly found that it became very helpful when putting time in perspective.  At first I thought that the hero was too young for his age but then I noticed that he would have been only a year older than me when the book took place and I know that I was that young then too.  It is easy to see why conservative parents and schools would not want their students reading this but I whish it had been on my freshman mandatory reading list.  In 1970 Judy Blume published \\"Are you there God? It's Me Margaret\\" it chronicled the story of a girl becoming a young lady.  It was banned from libraries and called terrible things.  Stephen Chbosky bravely picks up where Blume leaves off.  Every teenage boy, especially the award ones, should read \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\".  It is truly a moving story that delves into the secret lives of teens.  As for being published by MTV... Well even a blind squirrel finds a nut once and a while.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Wow this was bad, I don't know where to start, OK, let's take it category by category: <br /> <br />CAST <br />Brad Pitt - He usually makes good choices about the roles he takes, this was an exception.  His face is too well known and modern to be in historical movies, it's like, 'Hey! it's Brad Pitt pretending to be an ancient Greek!'  His Achilles has no redeeming characteristics and I was very much looking forward to seeking him take an arrow in the heel.   <br /> <br />Orlando Bloom - Displays his usual wimpiness, which, suprisingly, is actually a good thing.  I wish the script writers would have been even less true to the source material and have Paris remain in Greece during the war.   <br /> <br />Eric Bana - I found him to be the only sympathetic character in the entire film, with the exception of Ulysses, and he was little more than a cameo.  Bana's Hector has a dignity and reservation about him that was very noble and watchable. <br /> <br />PRODUCTION VALUES <br /> <br />Sets - Far too neat and clean, looked like something out of a themepark; \\"The City of Troy - Sponsored by Pepsi\\". <br /> <br />Costumes - Same as above, everyone looked like a casino greeter at Caesars Place. <br /> <br />DIRECTION <br /> <br />I know for sure now that Wolfgang sold his soul to the devil for \\"Das Boot\\", lets just leave it at that.  Didn't have the guts to even hint at the real nature of Achilles' grief... sellout. <br /> <br />CONCLUSION <br /> <br />If you don't know the Iliad from Icarus and enjoy watching Brad Pitt scream and smack everyone in sight while covered with what I can only assume is JP4 jet fuel, it's the flick for you

0375703764|5.0|I could not sleep, could not turn off the lights for most of my journey into this book. Its format was really interesting and new, and there was something beyond the words alone that was horrifying. The prevailing feeling was one of darkness and being trapped in a dark, haunted maze.     The basic concept of the book is a psychological odyssey into a mysterious house using various perspectives (notes, scribblings, photos, film, letters...). The house itself is alive and changes: walls shift, closets and passages appear, and a sense of darkness, both real and figurative, creeps into the physical space and into the minds of any unfortunate inhabitants or explorers. As the story delves deeper into the house, so does it penetrate and destroy the reader's sense of comfort. The writings become more strange and obsessive, and sometimes even the visual effect of the text makes one's skin crawl. The way the plot unfolds is masterful, and transitioning through different voices really creates this world that is unquestionably real. I was too frightened to turn the lights off, but could not stop reading...This is one of the best books I have read, and is by far the most frightening one.    The plot is great, the changing voices and perspectives are well put together, and the appendices and weird footnotes add the extra authenticity needed to make this book what it is. Get lost in this strange house. You'll love it.

B000BKJ78K|1.0|First he deliberately keeps quiet about the changes to last years set, now he's trying to outright trick us- these are the very same 2004 destroyed editions from last year, but with the original theatrical poster art. a lot more unknowing people will be dupped. <br /> <br />Being a Christian, there are somethings about Lucas I can't say here.
B0006284JQ|3.0|This album, being britney's 5th, is ok. It is a greatest hits album, which is cool, but I think her fans want to hear some new stuff, eben though they all still love her old stuff too. Also i think she needs to stop acting as if she's still 17, she's married now and has a kid, so start dressing and acting your age! Don't get me wrong I love her music and it makes me want to get up out of my seat and dance, but this 24 year old woman needs to start growing up. She could wear a little bit more clothes and people will still think she's \\"sexy\\" and she could stop getting on tv and telling the whole world that she's no longer a virgin and that her and kevin \\"do it 3 times a day!\\" No one wants to hear that, thats her private business!! Anyway, the CD is ok, it is missing some hit songs but has most of the godd ones, but britney, GROW UP!!!

B000002H2H|5.0|This is beyond a shadow of a doubt Metallica's greatest album. Every song is awesome and every track is as good as the last (well, almost). This is a classic album and every metal fan needs it in their collection. Kirk Hammett proves that he is a skilled guitarist and (while not playing with as much speed as say, oh, Mustaine) he plays with a lot of soul. Lar$ proves that he at one time was a an awesome drummer. Cliff Burton (RIP) is THE MAN. His basswork was great all the time and I wish he would come back and slap some sense into that over acting guy from Korn.<br /><br />1. Fight Fire with Fire: Don't be fooled by the classical-ish intro, this song is all metal. It starts off with a speedy riff and thrashes the hell outta you. 10/10<br /><br />2. Ride the Lightning- The second best track on the album. That riff is one is one of the most memorable metal riffs of all time. 10/10<br /><br />3. For Whom the Bell Tolls- Bells is while very simple to play on guitar, very memorable and one of the band's most known song. I always look past its simplicity and listen to the heart that the band probably put into writing an awesome song. 9/10<br /><br />4. Fade to Black- This one always brings a tear to my eye. Well, maybe not but it is great. While its kind of out of place on this album being very soft, the lyrics are top-notch and the song itself works on so many levels (ballad, heavier song). 10/10<br /><br />5. Trapped Under Ice- My least favourite song of the album. It is good instrumentally but for some reason it just doesnt' hold up as good as the other songs for some reason. Don't get me wrong I still like it but its just not as good as the rest. 7/10<br /><br />6. Escape- Very underrated. No one gives this song decent appreciation. I myself love it. It could of had been great song for the band but it went under everyones radars. 9/10<br /><br />7. Creeping Death- My favourite Metallica song EVER! It has awesome riffs, solos, lyrics and vocals! The second I heard this song I knew Metallica was gonna be one of my favourite bands for a long time. 11111111111111111111111/10<br /><br />8. Call of Ktulu- A beautiful song really. Really highlights the talent of each band member to the fullest. Much like all of their instrumentals do. 10/10e bands for a long time. 11111111111111111111111/10    8. Call of Ktulu- A beautiful song really. Really highlights the talent of each band member to the fullest. Much like all of their instrumentals do. 10/10
0684800713|4.0|I don't know that Hemingway's work takes on quite the depths that he is given credit for, but it does have emotion and a feeling. He gives the feeling that is there, the emptiness that the characters fill with booze and Brett. It is a picture of the loss of innocence and trust in our modern world. It is sad, the only thing that any human has to seek after in the book is alcohol and sex, and both leave the person empty. The closest thing to a real relationship on the book is between Jake and Brett, which cannot be because of his incapability to fill her carnal needs, though it is the one thing that might actually make them happy, since it is not based purely on sexual attraction. The bullfights are gory, and eveything has a kind of gritty, earthy feel to it. It is a simple story of the insatiability of the human desire...there's always another bull to kill...

B0007OCG4W|2.0|Here's what the DVD box said about this film: \\"A witty, romantic, and very dangerous love story...\\" In fact, this film is neither witty nor romantic, and it certainly isn't a \\"love story.\\" This is a film about sexually unhealthy people who bombard us relentlessly throughout the movie with their weaknesses, insecurities, and lack of capacity for love and understanding. If any single person in this script had learned anything at all from their experiences it would have helped, but we are left with an over-riding sense that the whole mess is just one big empty vaccuum of unfilled relationships, inability to make amends, lies, deceit, guilt, perverted sex, and failed attempts at love. Sorry, but although I love all four of the actors in this film, it's pretty much the worst script I've seen in years.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|A fine collection of the b-sides and rareties that have been floating around for a while online.  Noticeably missing are \\"Lovers\\" and \\"To Have and To Hold\\".   A must have for fans and collectors.
B00065JTBA|1.0|Just read his review of this POS and you'll know how idiotic this entire band is.  <br /> <br />Bon Jovi were sugarcoated, inoffensive, cliche, simple, and just stupid. They were the third worst part of the 80's only better than Europe and New Kids On the Block. <br /> <br />God I hate this (joke) ;)
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Forget that this album is DEATH CAB's first on a major label. what does that really mean anyway? if they were to have put these same songs out while still on BARSUK we'd still like them, we'd still respect them. the fact is they are a good bad, a great band. they have proven it in the past and PLANS is no exception. sure it's a little too slick, but they're not THE MOLDY PEACHES. they're DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE, one the best bands to come out of the great Northwest since NIRVANA. they helped pave the way for musical acts like THE DEAD SCIENCE and THE WAY IT IS. as i've said before, a band's true fans must evolve with them, grow with them. that's the case here. new label or not i'm still a DEATH CAB fan and will be until there's a relative gap between what i like to hear and what they like to play. case closed.
B00012QM8G|5.0|One min' he's playing Oscar Schindler...oposing the nazi's.<br /><br />Next he's an IRA leader (Michael Collins), more or less a Nazi sympathizer...make up your mind Liam!<br /><br />....and take an acting role that challenges you next time.<br /><br />But seriously...a very good movie that everyone should watch.
B000B0WODA|5.0|The self titled debut of Franz Ferdinand was, in my opinion, fantastic, though I would argue that it was of limited scope. The sophomore effort, however, is absolutely fantastic and has something for everyone on it. <br /> <br />Almost every song on this album is a gem, especially the first single. My favorite song on the album is probably the Beatles-esque \\"Eleanor Get Your Boots On.\\"  <br /> <br />This album has slower songs on it that appeal to more than the dance hall audience and I would suggest that anyone who liked the first album (and those who didn't, as well) give it a listen.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Martin Scorsese's lengthy study of Bob Dylan's early years is about as thorough a look at the early 1960's folk music scene as you're likely to get.  Along with Bob, there are interviews with Dave van Ronk, John Cohen, Izzy Young, Tony Glover, Suze Rotolo, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, even Pete Seeger and Allen Ginsburg--in short, anyone who could be found who was around in those early years.  There is, amazingly, a candid and almost relaxed Dylan himself, offering early memories and reflections on his entry into the music business, some of which is straight out of \\"Chronicles,\\" but much that is new.  In terms of facts, there is probably nothing here that the committed Dylanologist won't already know--if you've read \\"Chronicles\\" and Robert Shelton's \\"No Direction Home,\\" and if you've bought all the \\"Bootleg Series\\" releases (including the excellent Volume 7 that serves as the official soundtrack to this film), then you're already pretty familiar with what's on this disc.    That being said, there is a cornucopia of visual delight awaiting both hardcore Dylan fan and curious newcomer alike.  The film is rich in images, not just of Dylan, but of the early 60s New York folk scene, including old TV performances and concert clips.  Much of this has never been seen before, and it's an exhilirating treat for the eye as well as the ear.  And it's not just wall-to-wall Dylan: the film does a good job of setting Bob in the context of the folk music boom of the early 60s, in order to highlight just how different, how extraordinary he really was.   In fact, the main theme of the film is how Dylan kept re-creating himself artistically, much to the bewilderment--and sometimes anger--of his fans and colleagues.  The linear narrative of Dylan's rise in first the folk and then the rock world is intercut with scenes from the legendary 1966 tour of the British Isles--footage shot, I assume, by DA Pennebaker for \\"Eat the Document.\\"  Here, the booing and the catcalls are prominent--even morethan they are on the Manchester concert recording issued as \\"Live 1966\\"--and we get close-ups of Dylan's bleary, drug-bolstered-and-sleep-deprived eyes as he forces the audience to listen to grungy, elemental performances of his songs with The Band.  Thus, the darling of the folk boom becomes the \\"Judas\\" who sells out to commercialism.  It all seems rather ridiculous now, but it's fascinating to watch people so upset by Dylan's change of sound.    I'm not sure if, at the end of it all, I understand Dylan the man any better.  For example, the film says nothing about Dylan's relationships with Suze Rotolo, Joan Baez, or Sara Lowndes--so anyone looking for juicy insider gossip won't find it here.  Similarly, a lot of Dylan's childhood is passed over, except for his discovery of Hank Williams and black R & B artists.  Dylan himself is typically offhanded about his work, so we don't get any particular insights into \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" or any other song associated with him.  But that's not really the point.  What the film forces us to see--and what really matters in the end anyhow--is Dylan the extraordinary artist, the writer and performer who, as many in the film suggest, had the uncanny ability to absorb the feelings of those around him, and to articulate those feelings as no one else could.  At the same time, when Dylan chose to follow his own creative urgings, there were many who could not accept that he wasn't necessarily supposed to speak for them.  There's still a lot about Dylan that is left unsaid here, so one cannot call this \\"definitive,\\" but as a portrait of the most amazing songwriter of the 20th century during his most productive and creative time, this film cannot be beat.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|These guys could of easily released a third album which sounded like their two previous albums, or released some sort of trendy, whiny-emo album ala The Arcade Fire and they probably would of sold a lot more records, but they didn't.  This record is stripped of the 'wall of sound' that was their sound on their previous albums, and goes for more of a rootsy/gospel sound, which they do well.
B0001XALTG|4.0|The movies ok...but read the book, or even better, go live in Scotland and get a herroin adiction.<br /><br />Want a good Danny Boyle movie? Try \\"Shallow Grave\\"
B0002OERI0|5.0|As an old ex-republican, I have to see I picture our president and congress everytime I play the title track.  But hey, I like all the other tracks as well.  I really didn't like this album at first, but my daughter played it all the time.  It really grows on you.
B000AA305M|5.0|This is a David Gray must have!  If you get to see him in concert--Do it!  He is amazing. I think this CD really catures and projects his talent.  It is one you won't get tired of either!
B00003CXCW|3.0|This is supposed to be a minor classic in the genre of hollywood movies about hollywood, but it's hard to see what's so great about it. I guess that when it was made, the portrayal of the fading silent screen star \\"Norma Desmond\\" obsessed with fame might have been considered shocking, but not today. Most of the movie takes place within the decrepit mansion of Desmond, which despite its emptiness and size still manages to feel claustrophic. There just wasn't that much human interest in this depressing story of the co-dependent relationship between the aging star and the desperate screenwriter. If you want to see a really great movie about actresses and acting, see ALL ABOUT EVE starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, and Marilyn Monroe, one of her early films.
B00002E224|5.0|If you don't like this film, well that's just too bad!!! Watch Cameron's Titanic instead, or some other stupid blockbuster. You don't deserve a good film like this.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Panic! at the disco is a fresh sound that is very addicting.  It has rock rhythm which is easy to listen to.  There music is addicting as much as the lyrics.  This band reminds me of Fall Out Boy with a more rock edge with a techno beat.  The music is well done and the cd is awesome.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Yes this show isn't SG-1 and sadly some people can't seem to get pass that. The show is different enough from Sg-1 that it can hold its own and not be considered a rip-off or a clone yet retain the same Stargate feel that SG-1 has. This show is actually what rekindled my interest in the Stargate franchise, you've got characters that actually aren't perfect, that make mistakes and are easy to relate to. There mostly ordinary people in an extraordinary situation where they slowly come togethor and become a family of sorts. The strength of this show is the character development, which actually is even more noticeable in the second season but the first season does a pretty good job. Probably the best episodes story wise are Before I Sleep and Letter from Pegasus which are perhaps the best clip show episodes ive seen in the Stargate franchise.  <br />If you can accept that this show isn't actually SG-1 and really we don't need two Sg-1's bcse we already have one, try this show out, you might enjoy it. The show has fun,attractive and real characters that actually grow and change and there is reasonable continuity theoughout the season which is important to you if you don't like shows that you leave you guessing for a long time.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|It's hard to believe that this is from the same guy who did Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive. I never thought David Lynch would make a sentimental movie, but this is it! Supposedly it's based on a true story, which helps save it from complete sappiness. A quirky look at small-town America. Very wholesome, but not exactly gripping. Deliberately slow moving, just like a lawnmower on the freeway.
0375703764|5.0|This book was possibly the best book I've read in a long, long time. It was completely engrossing! I couldn't stop reading it, and through the excitement and frustration of everything it just took me over completely. It is truly a one of a kind book and I would recommend it to anyone who has an open mind and a lot of time on their hands!
B000BBOUU4|2.0|It might be the face that the orginal Charlie and The Choclate Factory was so good that the remake by Tim Burton didn't live up to my standards.  I like Tim Burton and the movies he makes but, tampering with a classic is just wrong.  Everyone who had seen the orginal loved it but people who went back and saw the remake were less than satisfied.  They left out parts of the orginal like the everlasting gobstopper and the bubble scene.  These two things were not in the book but made the first movie that much stronger.  The movie was appealing visually but that what Tim Burton does best.  Overall this movie was a so-so makeover which left critics and fans frowning.
B000929AJQ|2.0|Well, if this is how Reznor wants NIN to be now, so be it. It's his band.  However I Don't like it AT ALL.  I'll just hear The Fragile and think back to that masterpiece which With Teeth doesn't EVEN compare to. With Teeth is a band album really, and The Fragile was Trent Reznor. Being a band album isn't bad of course but at least make it good, lol.  Anyway, I don't promote this album in anyway, I'll always downtalk it if anything.  I never said I was a true or die hard NIN fan anyway but I knew when he made great music and this is NOT it.  And People have said in reviews supporting With Teeth, saying that it is better and a breath of fresh air from The Fragile......That is the BIGGEST oxymoron I have ever heard and a COMPLETE stupid thought process to me, lol.  How can With Teeth, be a \\"breath of fresh air\\"  to a masterpiece like The Fragile?????  As if The Fragile stunk and With Teeth saved NIN!  Please, there is a reason why the majority of people on amazon gave With Teeth a lower overall rating than The Downward Spiral and The Fragile.  Which just undercuts that statement of With Teeth being the saving album.  But, hey, people that like With Teeth better than The Fragile although I can't see why, is their opinion and they are entitled to it.  I just feel The Fragile hasn't gotten enough justice.  The Fragile has instrumentals, great pop/buzz saw hooks.  It is a double CD for a reason, took a lot of time to make it.  Bottom line, his most artistic sounding album to date.  As to why I give it my support over With Teeth.
B00005JOCN|3.0|Granted it is not one of Astaire's and Rogers' best, but if you are interested in 30's chic at all (do you watch the Oscars mainly for the clothes?) this film has Rogers in one of the greatest black satin gowns of all time.
B000AARKOO|4.0|obviously the \\"too slow\\" guy isn't a histoy buff, or else he wouldn't be saying it was to slow.  the movie was full of historical events and it was pretty interesting, and about 10-20 minutes into the movie there is a pretty sweet skirmish, and alot of continous or important information from there out
B000002GFC|5.0|A bold statement, I know, and one that may cost me helpful votes. As if I cared. But it's true: Zeppelin's heavy, distorted blues-rock sound had been pioneered by Cream a good two years before Zep came around, plus Cream had musch more interesting lyrics - it helps that they collaborated with poets while Zeppelin just piled on cliched smut.<br />Anyway, yes this album is loaded with rock classics, mostly originals though there are three amazing blues covers: Crossroads is one of the ten, if not five, greatest songs of all time, and their versions of Spoonful and Born Under a Bad Sign also must be heard. Still, you should treat yourself to original songs such as White Room (my favorite Cream original, though Crossroads is their best song overall), I Feel Free, Sweet Wine, Sunshine of Your Love, Politician (They beat Led Zeppelin to the \\"guitar army\\" sound here!), Tales of Brave Ulysses, Strange Brew and Badge.<br />But some great moments were skipped. I'd like to see As You Said show up on a Cream best-of for a change, since it's really one of their better songs. Same with Ginger Baker's drum showcase Toad, I mean the studio version of course and not the indulgent live one. Lastly, Dance the Night Away would've been appreciated. Any one of these cuts could've taken the place of Wrapping Paper.<br />Start here, but make sure to get Fresh Cream, Disraeli Gears, Wheels of Fire, BBC Sessions and maybe Goodbye.
0385513755|5.0|This book is not only a well written fiction; it is also an inspiring work that made me want to deepen my knowledge of art history and maybe even travel. The illustrations are a great addition to this edition.
B0009QBLA8|5.0|\\"Eraserhead\\" is the bizarre story of a man named Henry who fathers a prematurely born child that just won't stop crying.  Crying, and crying, crying.<br /><br />The movie is shot in grainy black and white, and is constanly filled with sound. Crammed with sound: crying, subway cars rushing, pipes clanking, weird organ music playing, machines humming, and the white noise roar of silence, the loudest sound of all, coursing through all of it.<br /><br />The story unfolds like a dream--and probably actually includes the dreams of the main character as well.  Events transpire associatively--as in dream--going from one thing to the next as a conversation hops from something to something else that one of its speakers was just reminded of.  It doesn't progress at all like a typical narrative, though the darkness and the confusion and the noise and the stress and the awkwardness of it all could classify this movie as a horror film, though it's much, much more.<br /><br />Its images are stark, and its dialogue almost nonexistent.  When there is dialogue, it's often funny (although creepy): \\"Did you and Mary have sexual intercourse?\\"<br /><br />A terrific organ music soundtrack underscores much of the movie, and its images, although black and white, will blaze themselves into your brain.<br /><br />When my younger brother was in high school, he got obsessed with this film.  He watched it literally hundreds of times, painted his room gray, put up \\"Eraserhead\\" posters, wore a black \\"Eraserhead\\" T-shirt, stopped bathing, and got weirder and weirder by the day.  He's never quite recovered from it.<br /><br />This is definitely David Lynch's best in my opinion.  I don't think he's ever equalled it.  It's a great movie to have on in the background of a party, or to watch by yourself late at night.  It's a classic puzzle that no amount of viewings could ever solve, and a fun, wild, weird ride.
B000A0GP18|4.0|...but that might not be saying too much.  I've never been a big fan of Adam Sandler, but I have to say, he was good in this movie.  If you compare it to a movie like Billy Madison, this was a great movie. The story flowed pretty well and casting was pretty good too.  Most of the actors portrayed their characters really well.  My biggest complaint is that a lot of the scenes that were supposed to be really funny weren't funny at all.  After a few scenes, I found myself asking what in the world the director was thinking.  Most of the really stupid moments that were supposed to be really funny were the scenes used in the trailers, so don't judge this movie by its trailer.  I swear the movie isn't that bad.  I haven't watched the original yet, so I can't compare the two, however, from what I've read in the other ratings, myabe I should have watched the original first.  Definately rent before you buy!
B000003JA7|5.0|I had my doubts about TAAB initially, but I still wanted to hear it. Now that I have, I realized that nobody does stuff like this anymore, and that needs to change.<br /><br />For those who've never heard of it, Thick As a Brick is an entire album devoted to one song, entitled Thick As a Brick. It's a long, rambling piece with some impossibly dense lyrics, the first side being by far the best, especially those first three minutes or so. The lyrics are great, rivalling Bob Dylan in delivery and crypticness (is that a word?) And the musicianship is, as we'd expect from the group, top-notch.<br /><br />The second side is a bit weaker than the first, but still strong. You should own this record.
B000002B1M|4.0|This album is very very close to the classic illmatic, but somehthings missing. Maybe all his talk about money, its not his fault that was the era. None the less a 4 1/2.
B00068CVJ4|5.0|This quickly became one of my favourite albums of all time after buying it because I liked the look of the album cover. There aren't many pieces of music that capture my energy quite like the now defunct hardcore post- punk band At the Drive-In.  This isn't for everyone's taste that's easy enough to tell, but if you find it easy to listen and 'get into' various lesser known types of music then I suggest you take a good look at this. \\"Cosmonaut\\" will implode your heart with passion and fury, whilst the following track \\"Non-Zero Possibility\\" will leave you comatose with its anthemic despair.

0736041850|5.0|I am a personal trainer at a local gym.  Whenever I take my copy of this in, everyone wants to look at it and not give it back.  So many of them have bought it, I think the publisher should give me a cut.  Accurate, informative, and readable.
0553260111|4.0|I read the book before I saw the movie but I still agree that the book is better. Marie had more class and was far more interesting than the one in the movie and Jason Bourne also had a more honorable cause. Instead of being a CIA assasin who screwed up he was the legendary Delta tracking the infamous assasin Carlos for three years. It's a non stop page turner that kept me in the dark until the very end, the plot is that unpredictable. There's still a lot of slow areas that I find very annoying but that may be because I was to eager to find out what happened next. Now the only reason why I gave this book four stars was because Carlos aka The Jackle was an assasin in real life that the one in the books was based off of. However somethime after Ludlum wrote the story, \\"Carlos\\" was actually found to be the most pathetic assasin of his time. He messed up simple missions and took credit for kills he had nothing to do with just for the attention then he ended up as a scapegoat both the government and various parties lay blame on. That was probably why Carlos wasn't included in the movie.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is arguably the most influntial modern-rapper around.  He has layed down numerous tracks that have spoken out to many a people.  For instance, \\"Jesus Walks\\" criticized the rap industry for not recognizing people who rap about god and religion.  The line, \\"If I talk about God my record won't get played\\", I think will influence more rappers not to worry about what they rap about.  Not every song you sing has to be about sex, drugs, and rims.  And K-West was the first one to have the balls to spit it out.

B0006IIPIK|3.0|SKY CAPTAIN is one of the most visually striking films of last year but ultimately it's hard to care very much about the story.  Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow are skillful but cold, which is probably partly the fault of the script.  We're supposed to forgive Paltrow's character for hiding the film's all-important McGuffin from her former boyfriend Law because she wants a scoop.  (She's a reporter, which apparently excuses everything.)  The only actor who seems to be having fun is Angelina Jolie, who swashbuckles around doing an English accent that sounds like it was intended to trump all the accents Paltrow's done.  In the end, the film is great to look at but not much to listen to.
B00005JODA|4.0|As evidenced by \\"City of God\\" and now with this feature, Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles may make the most visually arresting movies today and is certainly not afraid to take on seemingly untouchable subjects that are infused with life and death. This time he transposes the plot from his native Brazil to Africa where he captures the kinetic vibrancy of that world with equal &eacute;lan. Similar to his previous film though, where I still feel he is lacking somewhat is developing a core heart around his characters that makes us care about their fates. This gap seems more pronounced this time since the plot is essentially a love story as much as a political thriller.<br /><br />The story focuses on Justin Quayle, a reserved, mid-level British diplomat based in Kenya, and Tessa Abbott, the politically obsessed woman who complicates his life immeasurably but of course, excites him to no end. The development of their romantic relationship is given short shrift for the sake of the movie's time-bouncing structure, but this is not due to the lead actors who are quite compelling. Ralph Fiennes captures the exterior cool and interior fire of Quayle that motivates his intense politicization toward his wife's causes, the primary one being the purported abuses by multinational pharmaceutical companies testing radical experimental drug on unsuspecting Africans who are willing to receive free treatments. Looking and acting uncannily like Kate Winslet, Rachel Weisz has less screen time as Tessa, though she makes her moments count as her character has to remain somewhat of a cipher to move the thriller aspects along effectively. The relationship between Justin and Tessa is unsurprisingly volatile, but Meirelles leaves the actors alone to convey whatever romanticism may be underneath.<br /><br />As is true with most John Le Carr&eacute; stories, this one contains several characters who do not seem to be what the appear - Tessa's colleague Arnold Bluhm may or may not be having an affair with her; Quayle's boss Bernard Pellegrin may be in cahoots with the drug companies; and Quayle's best friend Sandy Woodrow may turn out to be a backstabber worthy of Shakespeare's Iago. Bill Nighy - most familiar to me as the comically aging rock star in \\"Love Actually\\" - certainly does an effective about-face as the malevolent Pellegrin, and Danny Huston (John's youngest son) does an adroit job in portraying a man who has been robbed of his conscience. A grizzled Pete Postlethwaite shows up late in the movie as a doctor who explains some of the loose plot threads and conveniently summarizes the situation with the Africans. Changing locations with dexterity from London to Berlin to Nairobi to remotest Kenya, Meirelles propels the storyline with fury and unique style aided immeasurably by C&eacute;sar Charlone's vibrant cinematography and Alberto Iglesias' original, authentic-sounding music score.ss Bernard Pellegrin may be in cahoots with the drug companies; and Quayle's best friend Sandy Woodrow may turn out to be a backstabber worthy of Shakespeare's Iago.

0393317552|4.0|Overall, this is a brilliant piece of work that provides a convincing explanation of an important, if not sole, factor in explaining certain aspects of the modern geopolitical situation. He discusses fascinating historical theories. Most important, he does this within a scientific framework, explaining the rise of states through evidence rather than bizzare philosophical theories or ideology.    My one fault with this book is its lack of scope. For the most part, Diamond seems content to explain prehistory and 1492. He spends far too much about Polynesian societies relative to his discussion on other civilizations, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. He does not go too much further beyond that in detail. For example, he spends little time on China and its failure to become a greater power during the 1400s. This had much to do with China's geography (a secure border against southern incursions but an open northern one), making it relevant to Diamond's thesis, yet it is ignored. This leaves gaping holes in his thesis about human development.    One last comment: I think Diamond took more care in his recent book Collapse to emphasize that human choice and policy decisions do matter.    A definite must-read for all history students, any age, any continent.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|....this score still gets a 5 out of 5 from me, though I would rather give it a 4.6 out of 5 due to the shortness of it. I did not have the sound quality problems though.  As far as the musicality of the soundtrack goes: <br />I agree -  some of the themes are very overpowering and I don't really like many of Badelt's transitions from very intense themes to a completely different, almost loving theme at times.  However, this does not happen very often. <br />I agree - the names are incredibly off and make no sense.  However, I rarely listen to soundtracks and look at the names at the same time and many times have my player on shuffle anyways, so it leaves it up to my brain to place me in the correct spot in the movie, which generally isn't terribly difficult to do. <br />I agree - this score may not be a great listening experience for Williams lovers.  It will, however be a great listen for Hans Zimmer lovers, as his style is clearly shown throughout the score, which (I believe) is more a testament to the years Badelt spent under Zimmer's tutelage than Zimmer actually having a large hand in the compostion of the score itself.  The score is generally 50% really hard and heavy, 30% playful, and the rest either somber or a love theme of sorts (which I will admit, Badelt does not have a way with love themes).  So, with the general heaviness of the soudntrack, it may not appeal to the John Williams fans.  However, it is still a marvelous work of music in its own right, it's just a different style. <br />I agree - this is not as good as most of John Williams' works.  But honestly, how many soundtracks are?  John Williams has an intangible gift for being able to capture the spirit, mood, and direction of a movie in his music, not to mention wonderful directors in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to be able to tell him exactly what they want from the score and give him very intimate details about the film that can contribute to his composition process.  And I believe thatKlaus Badelt should be compared to John Williams, everyone always wants to be compared to the best.  However, I do not believe it is fair to either Badelt or Williams to hold them to the same standards.  Williams has created such a high standard for himself through his amazing compositions over the years that it's really unfair to both him and other composers to hold anyone other than John Williams to John Williams' standards. <br /> <br />That said, this is a marvelous soundtrack, I found it very entertaining and have problems turning it off.  The themes are very catchy, and though they do get a little repetitive at times, I don't think it takes too much away from the soundtrack.  This is the only instance where the soundtrack's relative shortness plays to its advantage - the length of the soundtrack doesn't really allow the casual listener to get sick of the themes because by the time you begin to get tired of the themes, the soundtrack is over.  Klaus Badelt is a wonderful up-and-coming composer that I see following in Hans Zimmer's footsteps (not Williams').  They have very similar composition styles, so if you like Hans Zimmer's albums, this album would be a very good buy (particularly Gladiator comes to mind as an album that sounds much like this one; Mission Impossible: 2 contains many of the same musical entities and themes, HOWEVER, MI2 contains a lot more of the modern instrumentation and style, as well as utilizing a chorus for much of the score, but the writing styles are otherwise very similar).
B0000A98ZP|4.0|Although it's a tough call to say which of the John Hughes movies had the most heart in them - as he did choose a medium of completely vain and self centered teenagers - I believe The Breakfast Club was probably the most artisticly inclined and showcased the most talent of them all. <br /> <br />A bunch of kids from the same high school from different walks of life and social casts have come together for a Saturday of detention.  They are an unusual mix of people (a Weirdo, a Delinqent, a Nerd, a Princess, and a Jock) all put together in one room for a day.  Here they are forced to look at each other which contemplating their detention assignment - writing an essay about what makes them them.  This was obviously meant to punish, but turns them into talking about themselves in ways they otherwise wouldn't and the play unfolds. <br /> <br />It was odd to see Molly Ringwald here as the snotty popular girl when she is perhaps more famous for being the outcast.  Here she will only speak to the Jock as she considers him to be her equal and not the others until the Delinquent Judd Nelson bullies his way into cracking her shell.  And eating sushi for lunch with chopsticks?  That's a little strange.  Ally Sheedy, however, stole this movie in my opinion.  She is the sullen, twitching creep in the back.  The sandwich!  Who can forget that?!  And using her own dandruff on the drawing of the snowy day!  And we find out she wasn't in detention, she just didn't have anything else to do that day!!!  HA!  Anthony Michael Hall reappeared as the drooling Nerd once again, but he was probably the most dangerous of them all as he was in detention for bringing a gun to school.  And the Jock, Emilio Estevez, which is a sort of bad guy is actually pretty likable. <br /> <br />Why not 5 stars?  Judd Nelson.  Judd Nelson as the Delinquent was just exactly that.  He was annoying, obnoxious, insecure, and proved nothing except that his bad behavior earned him the next six months of detention Saturdays.  He was a rebel without  a clue.  Know what's really scary though?  I remember my first real boyfriend used to look and dress like him, he even had those gloves with the fingers cut off if I remember correctly.  *Yikes!*
B000068IEU|2.0|The only thing that was interesting for me in this edition were the interviews of cast members in bonus features. It was rather funny to observe these guys in normal life understanding that they are not some cold-blooded murderers but really nice people :) As of a movie itself - actually I don't think anyone now can take it seriously. Because with all its plot and bloody sequences it looks very naive and silly. Later Wes Craven made an attempt to create something disturbing and succeeded - with his \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\". But \\"The Last House on the Left\\" is so stupid it can't bother anybody - only invoke an indulgent smile. Although I read so much it is the most shocking, disturbing and so forth... movie ever, although it has a tagline \\"To avoid fainting keep repeating: it's only a movie, only a movie...\\", I can't imagine a person who would faint watching this \\"slapstick horror\\". And can you believe it - in their interviews the makers of the film say their intention was to create a very disturbing flick, the one nobody ever saw. Well, maybe in 1972 this was the idea of a disturbing motion picture but definately not now.<br /><br />I can't see a reason to watch \\"The Last House on the Left\\". If you seek some shocking film, find something more  contemporary, something that would fit your expectations. The only reason I can come up with is to know what garbage Wes Craven was doing before he became a notorious \\"father\\" of Freddy Crueger.<br /><br />There are some interesting moments in \\"The Last House...\\" but they don't overweigh the whole stupidity of this movie. If you're not a fan of Wes Craven don't ever come close to this DVD.
B00028HBKM|5.0|When I came into this movie, I tried to seperate myself from the hype.  I didn't want to be a part of a church group or some religious leftist sect who was adoring this movie (I was actually out on a date that night with a nice Jewish boy seven years my junior and I'm Catholic - HA!).   <br /> <br />You try and try to seperate yourself from this movie, to pretend that you have absolutely no idea what this story is about, but it's impossible.  Live action brings so much more to light about the story, especially since it's so gory and graphic.  All around you there are people crying, gasping with the lashes and screams of pain.  There isn't one person on earth, past, present or future, who doesn't know this story.  Look at how cruel people really are.  Look at how they humiliate and destroy others all for their own gains.  And look at Jesus the whole time. <br /> <br />He FORGAVE them. <br /> <br />I do not consider myself an overly religious person.  I go to church twice a year (Christmas and Easter) to make my mom happy.  I do try, however, to do the right thing and look out for my fellow man.  Maybe it's a little ridiculous and PollyAnna of me, but that's what it's all about plane and simple.  I also don't want to go through life being a bitter person either, which is why we have to practice forgiveness.  It's quite simple really.   <br /> <br />But I don't believe Jesus really loved us.  He forgave us because we didn't know what we were really doing.  In many situations people know exactly what they are doing, and do it with full intent.  And they will hurt you, but you will forgive them somehow.  Don't believe me or agree with me?  That's fine.  I know Jesus had passion for us.
B0000666DW|4.0|MASTODON - Remission  -  In my eyes, Mastodon is one of the last true Metal bands.  Making music for themselves, not for the airwaves.  Now with the release of their newest monster LEVIATHAN they have received some commercial sucsess but it is more than well deserved to a band of this caliber.  In fact I love it when a band doesn't sacrifice their music but still is able to make a good living at it.  (It gives me hope!)  Remission is brutal album focused very much around Brann Dailor who is the best man behind the kit since Danny Carey.   From its 2-minute opener, Crusher/Destroyer to it's closing Elephant Man the album does not let up for a second.  As one reviewer said \\"I would purchase this CD for the snare-fills alone\\"  and he hit the nail on it's head.  On top of some of the finest drumwork around you get powerful guitars and thundering bass.  At first, Troy's vocals didn't really appeal to me that much... then I realized they aren't supposed to take center stage they are being used an instrument and are meant to add to the menacing wall of sound that is Mastodon.

B00005JNQS|2.0|While not the worst film I have ever seen, it was close. This film had not one single original idea. Even the puns were stupid: the main character is Copperbottom---like coppertop, as in battery? It was downhill from there. Robin Williams tries to reprise his brilliant genie from Aladdin, and falls flat. You need a good story to work with.  <br />Here is a short summary:  <br />The hero Rodney goes to the big city to seek his fortune with his hero, Bigweld, only to discover the bad guy ratchet has taken over. He has to find Bigweld and convince him to come back. That's about it.  <br />Throw in bad mamma of Ratchet who is a shameless rip-off of the witch in \\"The Wiz\\", some really pointless flatulence jokes and you have the whole movie. Even the pace was too slow. <br />On the technical side, there is too much on the screen constantly to focus on. On a normal TV the entire show is too tiny to see in the widescreen edition.  <br />The jokes will go over the heads of kids, and regrettably they are not funny for adults.  <br />I am a big fan of computer animation. Someone should have pressed the delete key on this dud.
0740748475|5.0|(I just received this today--The Complete Calvin and Hobbes! 10/4/05)<br /><br />4.9 Stars<br /><br />The collection consists of 3 books within one slipcase. Each page notes the date(s) of original publication of the strip(s) on that page. The strips have an appearance of being imposed on the page separately in respect to their original publication dates. This differs from other Calvin and Hobbes collections/treasuries; within those pages you find the strips laid out as a combined whole without distinction between each strip. There are also, of course, the wonderful watercolors by Watterson which appear occasionally, on pages respective of content and chronological order.<br /><br />Book One starts with a 14-page introduction/forward written autobiographically by Watterson on his view of comics and his relationship with Calvin and Hobbes. Includes photo of Sprite and a few other comics/early works by Watterson, as well as an early version of Calvin and Hobbes. Book One includes all the comics of 1985-1988; Book Two 1988-1992; Book Three 1992-1995.<br /><br />This is definitely an archival collection and not ideal for constant casual perusing, though the attractiveness makes it hard to resist. The printing, layout, paper, binding are beautiful but any wear and tear would be heart-breaking. This leads me to describe one drawback: these books aren't really hardbound books. They look so, because of their hard covers, but actually they are what's called \\"cardboard articles\\", meaning the pages are not stitched to the spine, and instead glued. Albiet, this is common book binding practice, but I'm sure most of us wouldn't have minded paying some more for real hardbound articles for the sake of longevity in preservation. So although this collection is best left for archival purposes, it's unfortunate they are not exactly archival quality.<br /><br />Despite the books being cardboard articles, the pages are easy to open up without damaging the fabric covered spine due to the generous space and horizontal orientation. However the images of Calvin and Hobbes on the front and back faces of the slipcase are printed on separate squares of paper glued to the surface, rather than integrated, or printed directly on. This is something I realized as I slid the collection onto my bookshelf and found I had to be careful or the sides of those squares might catch and lift a bit.<br /><br />The total collection weighs about 22.5 lbs, which makes it a bit awkward to handle. This wouldn't be such an issue except the books are snugly fit within the slipcase, meaning they're a bit difficult to extract without having to tilt the case forward a bit. It would be ideal if the slipcase had round cuts on the top and bottom corresponding to each book so one's fingertips could pry out the books with ease.<br /><br />The bottom line is that for Calvin and Hobbes fans who want to own a nice comprehensive collection, imperfections are there, but not enough to deter. The beauty of the pages and the excitement of owning this make those issues mere minor annoyances. It is also the ideal purchase for those who are new to Calvin and Hobbes. At one concise and reasonable price you get the Complete Calvin and Hobbes. This collection is sure to please.

B00011D1RC|5.0|Suggested by Vicki Baum's book \\"Menschem im Hotel\\" and the Broadway play by William A. Drake, GRAND HOTEL remains to this day one of M-G-M's most delightful and lavish films.  With a hand-picked cast from it's peerless roster of stars and top direction from Edmund Goulding, the film still casts a powerful spell today.<br /><br />The setting is Berlin's Grand Hotel in the 1930s.  Staying at the luxurious hotel is penniless Baron von Guigern (John Barrymore), ruthless magnate General Preysing (Wallace Beery), ambitious stenographer Miss Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford), fragile prima ballerina Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo) and Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) a dying man on his last fling.  It's fascinating to watch these characters and their stories merge and intertwine.<br /><br />The performances are sublime.  Garbo is perfect for the remote and disillusioned Grusinskaya, suddenly woken back to life when she falls in love with the Baron.  Lionel Barrymore is heartbreaking as gentle Otto.  Joan Crawford is a hoot as the stenographer with Hollywood dreams and a shady past.  The chemistry between Garbo and John Barrymore fairly crackles and their scenes together are some of the best in the entire picture.<br /><br />It's here that Garbo first uttered those five little words which would define her for the rest of her life - \\"I want to be alone\\".  The cast also includes Lewis Stone as the Doctor and Jean Hersholt as the desk-clerk.<br /><br />The DVD contains some great bonuses like a new Making-of documentary, footage from the lavish premiere and a rare Vitaphone musical short \\"Nothing Ever Happens\\" which is an hilarious parody of GRAND HOTEL.

0740748475|5.0|Bill Watterson's \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" was and is a singular achievement in art, blending the distinctive fantastic integrity of George Herriman's \\"Krazy Kat,\\" and Berke Breathed's \\"Bloom County,\\" the simple exploration of humanity of George Schulz's enduring \\"Peanuts,\\" and raising and perfecting the lesser talents of Hank Ketcham's circumscribed worldview of \\"Dennis the Menace,\\" and Gary Larson's skewed humor in \\"Far Side.\\" From this constellation of comparisons, Watterson's \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" is by far the brightest star, a supernova against white dwarfs, for it also adds and reveals an interior narrative that is simultaneously whimsical, and profound and moving like the deepest texts of ancient culture. To say that Watterson has created a visual poetic achievement on the scale of The Odyssey or The Holy Bible is not overstated, for as the appearance of this volume attests, something very significant has been achieved here. And yet, like blowing the seeds of a dandelion, it also is fun.<br /><br />It has been previously noted, but frankly too little has been said, of Watterson's refusal to license the Calvin and Hobbes characters for mass market merchandising. Such costly integrity is unknown in this day and age, and therefore a text such as this merits more critical attention, for Watterson has therefore said more loudly than he ever otherwise could have that he is saying something with his art that is beyond price. He could not sell it in that way, and as he allows in his few writings outside of the comic strip itself, Calvin and Hobbes is a deeply personal creation. Perhaps most of us will never be able to create something ourselves so deeply personal, and so we must pause and attention must be paid to the artist who has, particularly the artist who has at great cost.<br /><br />Fandom has explored the philosophical dimensions of \\"Calvin\\" versus \\"Hobbes\\" in the strip, and this again points to the inexhaustible nature of this classic text, for new dimensions are emerging in online discussions even now. Apart from the artistic integrity of the illustrations, Watterson's narrative is proving to be enduring beyond generations, combining the summit of achievement in two fields. Watterson is, therefore, an American artist simultaneously equal to both Mark Twain and John James Audubon, and from his merits deserves the Nobel Prize for literature. Would that the committee had the vision, this volume would certainly be among the finest ever to be recognized.<br /><br />As I live in France, I currently am among the few in the world to enjoy \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" daily re-runs in \\"The International Herald Tribune.\\" This is always a delight, yet Watterson would weep at the compressed space in which his creation appears. This volume, therefore, corrects what many of us suffered under during \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" print run and displays the strips in their proper originally intended size, with the Sunday features fully colored and breathtaking. For that alone this volume deserves five stars, and the additional collected material on Watterson's battle with comic space editors is always a welcome re-read.<br /><br />Watterson's deceptively simple use of line has influenced a new generation of artists, among notable ones are Aaron McGruder and his current strip  \\"Boondocks\\" and children's illustrator Jeff (Jef) Kaminsky in his \\"Poppy and Ella\\" and other works. For this legacy, Watterson is to be thanked. But for this complete collection and the excellent material assembled here as a permanent library worthy edition, Watterson deserves the highest distinctions both this nation and the world can offer.

B0008F1146|5.0|This classic Sepultura album is among the best metal albums of all time.  The tribal beats with hardcore metal is a winning combination.  The addition of the second disc with the intense cover of Bob Marley's \\"War,\\" \\"Lookaway\\" Remix with Mike Patton and \\"Mine\\" also with Patton are worth it alone.  The remix of \\"Mine\\" is intense and furious and the other remixes are good as well.  A live version of \\"Attitude\\" is a nice addition to this package.  If you don't already own \\"Roots,\\" this is the version to get!
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I liked all the songs on this album except Patience, Don't Cry, and Since I Don't Have You. They selected good songs, but this album makes Guns n Roses sound slow and all lovey and kissy. Only a few songs show their badass hard rock side(one of them, of course, Welcome to the Jungle). There were good slower songs(not very slow, but less than medium pace) like Civil War and November Rain. This album is definetly worth the buy, but get Appetite for Destruction as well, then you'll get to know Guns n Roses better.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Yes, the dude abides and walter kicks ass. But before anyone goes on about how funny this movie is, which it is, there is a serious subtext to this movie- nihilism. That's Nihilism, not 'nothing'. Nihilism is the denial that there exists any moral or guiding principle to live by. It is the moral destruction of the idea of good and evil. It's no coincidence that there are some Germans in this movie, even one floating drunk in the Lebowski pool. There are Germans everywhere. That's because nihilism is the pervasive philosophy of our times, for better or for worse, for the right wing (Mr. Lebowski) and the left (Jeff Lebowksi). Nihilism is sex (coitus) without the love, of which Maude Lebowski speaks, the meaningless accomplishments of one man, even without the use of his legs, the Vietnam war, the Credence tapes, the lopsided justice of the malibu police, it's the war against saddam. It's absolutely brilliant because there so much focus on the characters and the humor and the wierdness of it all. It's weird because it really is unsettling, that there really is a message underneath it all.
B000A0GYD2|3.0|When you compare this series with the \\"actual\\" moon landing footage from Nasa, this one is by far a better job and more realistic looking.   It just goes to show you that a moon landing hoax is not impossible to do, just take a look at how well done this series was, since they didn't actually go to the moon to film it, yet they pulled it off as if it were real and there was zero gravity.   Bravo! <br /> <br />If a movie company can do it so well with their budget and resources, keep in mind the government has an endless budget and resources to make such a movie too. <br /> <br />Also keep in mind that the US government is said to have sent all these men and missions to the moon, never once crashing on the moon or being unable to get back, and that is with 1960's technology, but today with all our computers and modern science, we can't seem to get MOST of our probes to Mars without crashing or getting lost, and the ones that do make it, constantly have problems and of course, we don't have the technology to ever have any of them come back to earth either. <br /> <br />To this day, the Russians, who beat us into space, beat us with satellites, even created a space shuttle that looked almost exactly like ours does, have STILL not been able to send a man on the moon. <br /> <br />President Bush wants to send a man to the moon, and for some reason it will take about 15 years to do it.   Perhaps by then, we will actually have the technology and ability to do such a thing.   Why doesn't anyone ask Nasa why they don't just use the EXISTING plans of space craft they already had so much SUCCESS with using 1960's technology that never lost a man on the moon? <br /> <br />Because that wasn't real?   Because it really will take 15 years before Nasa can figure out a way to get a man on the moon for real? <br /> <br />This series is very enjoyable when you realize it is science fiction all the way.    But do not confuse this with the real history of the US space program. <br /> <br />If out of dozens of probes sent to Mars, only a small tiny fraction ever make it, and of those, so many problems occur, then how can going back to 1960's technology have several manned moon missions where not one single man or craft crashed on the moon and died.   Not one.  PLUS they were able to go from the moon back to earth again, something no Mars probe has ever been able to do with today's technology.    <br /> <br />Surely, if even today, we have a plan and desire to \\"return\\" to the moon, the Russians would still want to at least go to the moon ONCE.   Yet they still don't have the technology to do so, just as we never did yet.    Nasa thinks in 15 more years we might be able to first send a man to the moon. <br /> <br />When watching this excellent series, keep in mind that they are not REALLY on the moon in this film.   The extras reveal HOW they dealt with the special effects of less gravity and such. <br /> <br />Keep all of that in mind when watching the Nasa films too. <br /> <br />Think about it. <br />
B000AP04L0|4.0|I love the first half of this movie. It's a dead-on satire of working life, and the details are just perfect. I wish they did more with it in the second half. The heist plot wasn't as exciting, and I was more interested in the office stuff than I was in Jennifer Aniston's character. But that is just a minor complaint. This is a hilarious movie you will watch over and over again t get all the jokes.
0743201140|5.0|That was the key idea I took from this book: it's OK not to be perfect at everything. In the self-help realm, I think there is an unrealistic expectation that if you read all the right books and attend all the right seminars you can become perfect at whatever you set your sights on. Yet, some of us struggle and beat ourselves up when we can't do what we are not naturally good at.  <br /> <br />So now I know what I'm good at and what I strengths I need to find in a business partner to compliment me. And together we can create our success.
B000AV2G3I|3.0|You can't put out a \\"definitive collection\\" of Lennon without \\"Crippled Inside\\", \\"Aisumasen\\", and \\"Remember\\".  Also, there have to be more than two tracks from \\"Sometime in New York City\\".  There are at least several songs on here that have no business being included (e.g. Bless You, Stand By Me, and Come Together).    I give them credit for including \\"Oh Yoko\\", \\"You Are Here\\", and \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out\\".  These are all justifiable, and to my knowledge, new to collected works albums.    If you want the definitive Lennon, you'll have to compile it yourself, because the people who put these things together are amateurs.
B00007KQA3|4.0|I have to admit that I was one of the few people who saw this film without having first read the book. (Most British students get this opportunity at secondary school.) The lack of a feel-good ending, coupled with all the controversy over the Eurythmic's soundtrack vs. the original orchestral score, made it a less than satisfying experience.<br /><br />Since then, I have read the book a couple of times, and it is now one of my all-time favourite novels. Orwell invents an entire political system which is utterly believable in every detail. However, in the novel, the 'proles' clearly have a better time of it than party members; despite official neglect, they are allowed to have a much more natural life-style ... and death. The film virtually ignores the proles entirely.<br /><br />In the novel, Winston has many dark subconscious urges -- e.g. wanting to smash the skull of the dark-haired girl, and thinking about pushing his wife off the cliff. He discovers memory fragments in his subconscious, of a time before IngSoc. In the film, these elements aren't really there. John Hurt portrays a rather agening but innocent 39-year-old, without any dark thoughts, or any leg ulcers or varicose veins. Instead we get a curious recurring dream where he is escorted by Richard Burton's O'Brien along a tunnel leading to a green landscape.<br /><br />The surprising aspect is how well the Eurythmic's soundtrack stands up after 20 years. It's a muted, ambient mix that anticipates an era of treated pop music by nearly ten years.<br /><br />Fortunately most societies have turned away from the totalitarian state that Orwell envisaged. The uniformity and utter obedience required, coupled with the 7x24 monitoring of our every move, now seems closer to the existence many of us experience in large institutions and corporations.
1400043662|4.0|This is my first Murakami novel and based on the reviews I've read, I'm very interested in picking up his earlier work to see how it compares.   He's a talented, wildy imaginative author, no doubt about it, but I do agree with another reviewer that his use of corporate icons feels forced.  Colonel Sanders as a pimp?!  I'm not sure where this comes from.  Is he trying to emulate pop culture obsessed American writers?  I was also disappointed to see Prince's name keep popping up (Kafka likes listening to \\"Little Red Corvette\\" while he works out).  It reminded me once again not only of American influence on this particular writer, but on foreign culture in general; sort of like walking down a beautiful boulevard in some exotic place and stumbling upon a McDonald's.  All nit-picking aside though, the magic realism aspects of 'Kafka on the Shore' and an intensely likeable protagonist in young Kafka make it an enlightening, enjoyable read.
B000AMU0QC|5.0|Anyone who programs a 0:40 track aptly entitled \\"Let's Hear That String Part Again, Because I Don't Think They Heard It\\" has definitely got me by the throat.

Call it hypnotically engaging because of its layer upon layer of sound (no category does it justice: twisted folk, perhaps performance sound art, or someone's fine arts degree thesis?)

Simply wonderfull music. But not in this album ... so repetitive, lacking variety ... just 2 or 3 themes (the fellowship and Frodo's themes) repeated once, twice ... until you sell the CD. If you want Lord of the rings music, and I urge you to buy and treasure, \\"my preciouss reader\\", buy the others. No important music is missed, for there all the important themes that appear here also are present, mixed with newer ones.

0062502182|5.0|After a friend told me that The Alchemist was one of his favorite books to teach and passing by it time and again on the table at the local bookstore, I decided to pick the book up and read it through.<br /><br />The story is phenomenal.  It is about a shepherd, Santiago, who undergoes his quest of his Personal Legend.  Through the course of the story, you meet an interesting array of characters like the King of Salem, the owner of the crystal shop, a camel driver, an Englishman, Fatima and the Alchemist, just to name a few.  Each is distinct and contributes to the growth of the main character.<br /><br />I also found the message about following one's Personal Legend hit me in on a personal level, since I have found myself at a crossroads in my life in following my dreams or taking another path.  The story does not tell you which why is right or wrong, but you feel Santiago's fulfillment as he pursues his path.<br /><br />The prose is simple, but the meaning is deep.  I have heard people compare Coelho to Richard Bach or Joseph Campbell.  While there are aspects that do translate, The Alchemist is an enjoyment of its own.  I highly recommend this book to anyone!
B0002YLC24|1.0|Two self absorbed people stroll along the streets of Paris with hardly a soul to be seen.  Have the people who made this movie ever been to Paris? They walk down the middle of streets with no one else around and not a car to be seen. They would be road kill in a matter of seconds. They literally avoid the sidewalks and walk down the middle of the street.The two characters had absolutely no personlaity or chemistry. It seemed they were each giving a speech w/o concern w/ how the other person reacted. I was sorely disappointed.

It includes all the music videos, plus the video for Root, previously unavailable. The mix of the CD is great...These songs are B-sides only because they didn't fit with an album, deftones quality is still there. Also, when deftones do a cover, they make it their own whether it's a Sade, Helmet, or Duran Duran cover. Well worth the money.

0385513755|4.0|I read the fictional work last year but some ghosts of Dr. Brown's book lingered on the mind. The most striking about the Da Vinci Code is its power to captivate. Although the quality of the writing is not first-rate, an opinion supported by some commentators and critics, its plot does lend the story a good measure of suspense that keeps the reader turning pages which is indeed remarkable. The conspiracy theories which proposed by the author are highly groundless. If one checks with two of the major sources of information of the interpretation of \\"historical\\" or simply ancient tabloid facts Dr. Brown used, namely the Holy Blood, Holy Grail and the Templar Revelation, it was established by everyone except Dan Brown himself that we are all satisfied with the truth that the theories were constructed based on materials from an era in history that can never be validated or relied upon. (Though some contributors to these two later works cited apparently have forgotten what was originally stated in their publications and changed their points of view after their releases as documented by interviews and some other entertainment or occult news outlets.) The characterization is week and monotonic. The characters are otherworldly and display some inconsistency in behavior at times, with roles played not in alliance with ones encountered in the real world. Our protagonist is almost always on the verge of an intellectual breakdown when situations turn bad. The fabled tales about Jesus of Nazareth and Mary Magdalene included in the Da Vinci Code are interesting but presumptuous. The seemingly non-exist secret society mentioned in the work is enigmatic but rather idiotic. Moreover, the anagram, another intriguing device abused in some of the more important scenes appears trite, and smart instead of intelligent. In these modern days encryption technology and other coding methods of a greater reliability abound and adherence to tradition when it is out of place does not seem like an acceptable practice for the secret society involved. It is important to mention that some plot lines are completely illogical and some overly melodramatic. The presentation of events is too unnecessarily sophisticated and tedious. There are plot twists that have too much weight and tend to confuse the reader when two realities are placed side by side as oppose to motivate their detective curiosity and to challenge them to engage in more thoughtful interpretation and guesswork. The realization of the true identity of our heroine in the climax may bring tears to the eyes of some readers, but lack substance and meaning. The materials were well paced and this skill is worthy of compliment. Overall, the Da Vinci Code is a very good thriller to test our faith and understanding in and loyalty to our collective deep-rooted Christian notions and beliefs.<br /><br />The photographs, paintings and other illustrative devices presented in the work helps to gain more insight into the art works mentioned in Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Remark: O holy, holy, holy.

B000002H97|1.0|I know all you die hard Metallica fans out there will hate reading this, and will probably vote this review as \\"Not Helpful\\", but you know what?  The truth hurts!  Face it people, this album $ucks.  Anybody who thinks this horrible, attrocious, self titled \\"$uck-o-rama\\" cd is worth four or five stars must be braindead from smoking crack. <br /> <br />This is where I got off the Metallica train forever, where I finally had to accept that Cliff Burton was indeed dead, the band Metallica with him.  This here is a TOTAL sellout album folks.  If you pay good money for this, than you are (like I was fourteen years ago) a $ucker. <br /> <br />In 1991, as a teenager who had grown up listening to Metallica in the 80s, to have to finally admit that such a fine, head banging band had become so greedy, commercial, and corporate, well it was disillusioning to say the least.  I just didn't want to admit it at first.  I mean, how could it come to this?  How?  From the heady heights of \\"Kill 'Em All\\", \\"Ride the Lightning\\", and \\"Master of Puppets\\" down to this embarrasingly inane corporate rock cr@p?  Cliff must have been turning over in his grave. <br /> <br />Listening now to \\"The Black Album\\" to write this review, my first listen in almost fifteen years, only brings back memories of crushing dissapointment after handing over my hard earned money for this made for MTV garbage.  I had expected this to be another metal classic; listening to this radio ready corporate rock bull$hit for the first left me feeling shocked, disappointed, and worst of all, ripped off!  I couldn't believe I had payed so much money for such a $hitty record.  It cost me $15.00, and that was a lot of money in 1991!  How could I be that $tupid?  What a $ucker I was! <br /> <br />Sitting through all these brain numbingly simple tracks brings home that the Metallica all us headbangers knew and loved in the 80s is completely dead.  Completely gone are the heavy riffs and speed demon guitar solos, replaced by short, simple, catchy little ditties tailor made for MTV and Top 40 radio.  They have nothing meaningful to say with this music, and the brainless lyrics reflect that fact:  <br /> <br />I'm your eyes <br />Make you real  <br />I'm your dream  <br />That you must steal <br />I'm your pain  <br />That you can't feel <br />Sad but true <br /> <br />This is by far one of the most loathsome crimes ever committed against music.  I hate this album with an extreme passion that no words could ever express.  I hate this album so much I want it banned.  SO its time for us 80s Metallica fans to gather up every existing copy of the black album and burn them all!  We can have a Black Album record burning festival! <br /> <br />The Black Album is an insult to all good music.  It is pure dog $hit!  Forget about St Anger, that album looks brilliant compared to the phenominal awfulness of The Black ALbum.  Just thinking about how annoying these songs are makes me hurt all over.  The pain in my ears caused by The Black Album is so intense that it spreads to every square inch of my body every time I hear anything off this impossibly $hitty record.  Oh how I hate the black album.  Before I heard this album, I had no idea that it was possible for a human being to feel such intense hatred.  You could probably power a whole city with my hatred for the black album.  It is the worst music the world has ever known.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|This is an odd and haunting independent film, the brainchild of Vincent Gallo, who wrote it, directed it and stars in it.  He's saying something in this film, something that seems a bit distorted.  But he says it well and because of this, there is a discomfort in watching it.<br /><br />This is the story of Bud Clay, who we meet as he loses a motorcycle race in New Hampshire.  He puts his motorcycle in is van and then takes off for California, where he is scheduled to participate in another motorcycle race.  We ride with him in that van, long stretches of roads through middle America.  And we also feel his pain about something although it takes a while for us to understand that he is obsessed with the loss of his true love, Daisy.  Mr. Gallo could be called a homely man.  His features are craggy and awkward, his nose looks misshapen.  But he has deep and sorrowful eyes and his fine acting makes his character seem real.<br /><br />I understand the film has been cut from the original and now runs a mere 90 minutes or so.  This is good because even though there is not much action I was never bored as I watched this long journey.  Along the way he meets some women, but he just can't get over his love for Daisy.  And then, just as I thought that Daisy was a mirage and never existed at all, we meet her.  Chloe Sevigny plays this role and even though she is on screen for just a short time, she is wonderful.  There's a scene then that probably has caused this film to be banned in many places because it is extremely explicit and violates whatever censorship rules are usually in place.  And yet, it is sad and very real and necessary to the film.<br /><br />How it all turns out is not pleasant as I realized that the whole film was a mix of reality and fantasy.  I will probably never forget it.  I thought it was a small piece of art even  though it is too weird for the average viewer.  Some will be bored.  Some will be disgusted.  And many will be sad.  So don't bother with this film unless you're prepared for something very different with an overtone of melancholy.  I therefore recommend it for only a few adventurous film buffs.re prepared for something very different with an overtone of melancholy.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|The arcade fire are mind blowing. They are by far the best canadian indy band of all time. This album is probably my favorite of the year.

B00004YKUY|1.0|Listen Folks, I am and always have been one of Journey's biggest fans over the years and I consider myself very open minded to all styles and types of music as well as VERY understanding to singers leaving bands and new singers climbing on board to begin the next stage of a band's career.  However what worked for Van Halen with the replacement of Roth with Hagar, falls VERY short with the addition of Journey's new frontman.  WHY?  Well, first of all, sure he SOUNDS like Perry but he is lacking one key ingredient that Steve Perry possesses that this new poser does not.  Inflection.  Feeling.  Charisma. <br />I can go on and on, but the mere fact that anyone who has already posted their review of the new singer can honestly say that this new guy is 'better' than Perry is like comparing Apples to Oranges.  Listen, I think it's great that Journey continues to play even if they could not work things out with Perry.  But to say that this album is anything more than an overpriced beer coaster would be a lie.  the new singer has no warmth to his voice and basically does nothing special for me. <br />Sorry but if I could give this album ZERO stars I would, but of course they must get 1.

B000001FKY|5.0|A friend of mine gave me a copy of this on tape in high school (1987) and just said \\"You've gotta listen to this !  It's brilliant !\\".  He was right.  I wore out the tape from playing it so much and constantly rewinding back to some of my favourite songs. <br /> <br />The best songs on this are Hysteria, Love And Affection, Animal, Gods Of War, Run Riot and Love Bites.  The others are cool, too. <br /> <br />This album for me is one of those that brings back so many great memories from a great period in my life.  When I listen to Hysteria I go back to that place.....
0224071262|5.0|I have read several books on the birth of Communist China, but I have never found a book that was so detailed in its offering.<br /><br />Whether you like Mao or not (he's certainly not one of my favourite characters in history), his story really is fascinating. The man had such an ego for power that it was all-consuming. His selfish desires led to the worst tragedies in modern history, all without the world ever really know what was really going on.<br /><br />Chang and Halliday have clearly put in a great deal of effort and it is no doubt that this book was years in the making. They delved into as many official and unofficial documents they could find, as well as interviewed everyone they could that had some kind of contact with Mao during his 82 years of life.<br /><br />To be honest, this book is certainly a hard read and may not be the best book for someone just taking an interest in Chinese history or Mao. However, for any Sinologist (professional or amateur), it is definitely a must to add to your personal library.
B000002LPD|5.0|This album was huge when it came out and really signified the peak of Van Halen's popularity as it was at that point in time (the early 1990's).  The music is exceptional, the lyrics are cool - sometimes fun and throwaway like on Poundcake and Spanked, othertimes serious and very mature / uplifting like on Right Now, The Dream Is Over and Top Of The World. <br /> <br />This is without a doubt the best Van Halen album, followed closely by 5150. <br /> <br />Listening to this brings back a lot of cool memories for me.....
B000B8IA2G|5.0|This show is fantastic! I love this series! Despite the negative veiws posted below (I don't know what \\"Karen\\" was watching but it sure wasn't Stargate Atlantis) I really enjoyed this show. Yes, its not like stargate but if you want Stargate then watch Stargate. I don't know what exactly they mean by the charectors not developing fast. So what if they aren't all peas in a pod like Sg-1! Not every show is like that. I, for one love how the team interacts with each other. I can't wait for this show to come out on DVD. 5 stars at least!!
B000B0WODA|5.0|We knew Franz Ferdinand was a love gang to be reckoned with, if you dare. But who knew that the bouncy infectious band was so sure that they have topped themselves? Alex Kapranos once told us to \\"Throw away the last one. Cleanse your mind.\\" I'm sure by that, we are just begging to hear this friggin' album they have been boasting about even with their title (which changed after we started grasping the concept of the last title).  <br /> <br />This album kicks off with \\"The Fallen\\", and it sounds like where the last album started off soft and sultry, they are trying to just hit you with the Part 2. The last album stopped with \\"40\\"\\" which is not much of an ending we wanted. So here comes the next saga for this one. To me, \\"The Fallen\\" would be a fast favorite for everyone and be a fast favorite to the others, too. \\"They're going to say \\"troubled boy\\" just because you like to destroy all the things that brings te idiots joy, well what's wrong with a little destruction?\\" The song isn't as bouncy as I predicted. Yet, I am getting a little (I said, a little!) bored of the last debut. Next comes that friggin future hit of a anthem for partygoers (especially since Alex wrote the song after a party) \\"Do You Want To?\\" The thing that may strike this is an out of mind experience is wondering how was it that \\"Well, do you/Do yay do ya wanna/Wanna go/Where I never let you before?\\" became a pickup line. Nonetheless, you find it funny the line \\"Well, he's a frined and he's so proud of you/A famous friend, well I B*** him before you.\\" Don't you? <br /> <br />Now with \\"This Boy\\", you would at least expect a softer start. But they hit you with a bouncy one that, truthfully, some fans will like and some fans will find OK, but Franz has too much mmunition to let you hate it. Especially for a song that is approximately 2:30 (really 21 seconds) long. But for me, at the end is where everything ends up falling into place where the narration is supposed to be from a little boy, because the ending was a little..appropriate but kills the mood just a bit. \\"Walk Away\\" starts off Franz and and the verses turns down the microburner a bit more. If you were looking for a \\"Jacqueline\\" or a \\"Cheating on You\\", \\"Walk Away is as close as you are going to get.\\" <br /> <br />Now how many people have ever seen a mosh pit at a Franz Ferdinand concert? Well, I have a feeling \\"Evil and a Heathen\\" will really do the trick for the likes of us. Becuase if you lsiten to the song, you will agree that bouncy will not do this justice. Along with \\"The Fallen\\", I think this will be a fast favorite with the fans, too. It already is with me. Until \\"You're The Reason I'm Leaving\\", you never expected a more straightforward breakup song with such attitude, ever since the song that made them an anti-hero \\"Cheating On You\\". \\"Eleanor, Put Your Boots On\\", which the bigwig reviewers would call a song dedicated to Eleanor Friedberger of The Fiery Furnaces. Now of course, I have never expected a song you can't dance to from Frand Ferdinand. But it seems that this is no exception to a good one. It even has Piano, and sounds a bit like they have a little Fiery Furnaces in them. I think the song is a 3/4th mediocre. It is not worth skipping. \\"Well, That Was Easy\\" wasn't it? Just joking, \\"Well, That Was Easy\\" has the art-rock band snapping straight back to infecting your eardrums with catchy songs. The song to me is just him getting through missing the one he loves. Hard as it is to say that the attempt is easy for some. Soon enough you will beggin to Franz to \\"C'mon kill me now/Kill me now!\\"  <br /> <br />\\"What You Meant\\" is a song that I would end up skipping a bit. \\"I'm Your Villain\\" starts off really surprising and evil that I am claiming predictions that you will hate them for it. The song is going to make you really bob your head or surprise you as much. Mostly, beg for a visit to Lacuna Inc for a way to get them out of your head, so you can start the process all over again. <br /> <br />Atthis point, I feel as if I don't really need to listen to more, but I have to. It is my job to look out for holes in such pretty balloons. The title track is OK. Some people will call this another \\"Michael\\". To tell you the truth, as fun as it is to take a listen,, we may need it a lot better. \\"Fade Together\\" is a beautiful take on a lush dream. To tell you the truth, I know their potential and I didn't think they could really pull off soft songs, but this song needs to be hit repeat. Not only that, but a separate side of great hits. They end on a party favor of a song and a way of leaving you hanging (again!) \\"Outsiders\\". OK. Nevermind. The CD ended with a fadeout instead of a scrape on your forehead but when you listen to this song, you still have a feeling the Fran Ferdinand was holding out on the songs. They will be like Krispy Kremes for the ears. No longer the Dunkin' Donuts. <br /> <br />In conclusion, their album says You Could Have It So Much Better, and it seems they did it by spreading their sound and making a spectacle out of being art-rock party scientists. Normally, I would hate CDs that start and finish off a smash the whole way, but as you can see Franz Ferdinand may have a right to be cocky. They just made you start a brutal nuclear World War V in your own bedroom. <br /> <br />Rating: 9.5/10 <br />
B0000TB05A|5.0|I purchased the jewel cased Slane Castle concert and it one of the finest rock music DVD's I have ever seen.  This concert was at Slane Castle, in Ireland, in August of 2001.  Pretty much all of U2's finest is on this recording and the recording quality is excellent.  I am not a big U2 fan, but U2's a great live band and this recording really captures their magic.  As far as the political statements, I would say that they are minimal.  I watch this DVD frequently and I enjoy it every time I watch it!
B00005JN5X|5.0|I hadn't read any reviews of \\"The Brothers Grimm,\\" since I trust Terry Gilliam more than any reviewer on earth, but I still had the impression that it wasn't getting good reviews, and the trailers seemed very generic, reminding me of such forgettable films as \\"Van Helsing.\\" So I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it ranks up there with Gilliam's best work. <br /> <br />Gilliam is doing a number of things here. The basic plot is a fairly light hearted adventure story--the Brothers Grimm are basically con artists, lead by the rationalist elder brother, who stumble (or more accurately, are forced) into a real fairy tail with real magic and real monsters. There is plenty of humor, but a fair amount of it is fairly...er, grim, and like most of Gilliam's work the movie can veer at short notice from the humorous into the downright scary.  <br /> <br />The characters are engaging, the effects are functional, and as always, the style is wonderful. In an amusing reversal of stereotype, the story is set in French occupied Germany, so we have the evil French overlords abusing the good German peasants. Along the way, we are treated to amusingly twisted references to a variety of fairy tales, as well as none-too-serious meditations on the relationship between rationality and fantasy. <br /> <br />As a double feature, it would pair well with \\"The Company of Wolves,\\" \\"Snow White - a Tale of Terror,\\" or Gilliam's own \\"Jabberwocky\\"
B0007OCG4W|3.0|My friends all told me this was a very depressing film about people that go out of their way to harm the ones they love. Given that the cast was starry and the script was intelligent, how could everyone be so wrong about this comedy hidden behind an incredibly handsome script?<br /><br />This is, indeed, a comedy. The ridiculous situations these people put themselves in had me laughing out loud over and over again. Julia Roberts was so funny as a vitimized victim -- the victim of her own foolishness -- that it was humorous.<br /><br />Jude Law, who starts out the one with the best handle on everything, that gets both women he wants, then ends up being the one most humiliated by a guy named Larry (Clive Owen) (being named Larry, I know what kind of roles are handed out to people named that) that it is, in the end, the pinnacle of comic irony.<br /><br />I think it would be easier to accept this film on face value if the four people involved were regular people. Since instead they are a writer, artist/photographer, stripper and doctor, I think you have to accept that these are not really people; they are actors playing out thinly veiled Hollywood cliches doing things handed to them from a script.<br /><br />The relationship to real life is negligible, at best, since their actions are the equivalent of my 20-year-old college girlfriend who regularly had more than one boyfriend. They are not the actions of mature 35-year-olds, which describe three of the participants.<br /><br />As comedy with irony interwoven, I think this film is successful in its display of human nature. But as a movie about dysfunctional relationships it is less successful that many smaller films and closer to being ordinary. Thankfully, at least one person saw the humor in this arrangement.<br /><br />This film most reminded me of Mike Nichols' now 40-year-old masterpiece, \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\", another blockbuster about a pair of dysfunctional couples. Only that movie was played straight. This one, like \\"The Graduate\\", was played for laughs about the human condition.laughs about the human condition.
B00000DI06|5.0|This recording of the Cambridge Singers has them recording pieces composed by their own director, John Rutter.  The Magnificat is Rutter's version of a standard piece of liturgical music, an intersection of old and new.  This was recorded at one of the Cambridge Singers' favourite venues, the Great Hall of University College School, London; the Requiem was recorded in 1986, and the Magnificat in 1991.<br /><br />--Music--<br /><br />'The Magnificat' is one of my favourite pieces of the liturgy, and one I enjoy hearing set to different kinds of music.  This is a very lively and spirit-filled rendering, with magnificent vocals expressing the joy that is found in the prayer of Mary - 'My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my saviour'.  The repetition of the word 'magnificat' over and over in the early part of the music reinforces this idea of joy and praise.  Rutter writes, 'I was conscious of following Bach's example in adding to the liturgical text - with the lovely old English poem \\"Of a Rose\\" and the prayer \\"Sancta Maria\\", both of which strengthen the Marian connection, and with the interpolated \\"Sanctus\\" (to the Gregorian chant of the Missa cum jubilo) in the third movement.'  This is an extended Magnificat, done in seven movements.<br /><br />Rutter's Requiem was written in 1985.  In Catholic liturgy, a requiem is a Mass for the Dead, and as such involves strong tones both of mourning and loss as well as elements of hope and eternal life as reflected in Christian belief.  Rutter states that, like Brahms and Faure, there are elements that depart from the traditional lines of a Catholic requiem.  Rutter takes some of the texts from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.  Both the first and second movements, Requiem aeternam and 'Out of the Deep', set very dark, low, sombre tones.  The use of strings at the beginning of 'Out of the Deep' is very effective, together with funeral-dirge like vocals.  This contrasts greatly with the Pie Jesu, light and spiritual.  The Sanctus is almost playful in aspect, and the Agnus Dei and Lux aeterna draw the listener higher and higher into the fullness of expectation of God's presence.<br /><br />--Liner Notes--<br /><br />The notes include an introduction to the CD by Rutter describing some of the influences and expressions in his composition.  Lyrics are included, and where the original is in Latin, an English translation is provided.

B000092ZYX|5.0|It's officially history: if you love music you will love Radiohead. And guess what ? This is the perfect CD. Fourteen classic songs that showcase the talent and creativity of my favourite band. Each song flows like a river, one will be carried to it ! O, and you've got to love the Electrona in it, tant parfait !
B000A0GP18|4.0|Without seeing the original movie, I would say that I thought the remake of the Longest Yard was a great football movie.  As an avid football player and fan, I have seen many football movies over the years.  This is definitely the best football movie I have ever seen.  Get out of the past and forget about the original.  If Burt Reynolds is ok with being in the movie, I think that it would be ok to like it too.  I have played against some of the best quarterbacks in the country, and Sandler was about as believable as I've seen in a movie. (He did make all those \\"amazing\\" throws on usually one or a few tries.) Chris Rock brings great comedic relief along with the rest of the inmates.  Sure the movie has some faults, but they are not noticable if you really sit down to enjoy this movie. I really enjoyed this movie.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I must say that I love everything Radiohead so I am somewhat biased. However this recording is UNBELIEVABLE. I love how each song flows into each other, each a careful mix of pop and rock. Some of the stand-out songs include \\"Karma Police\\", \\"Let Down\\", \\"No Surprises\\", and \\"Paranoid Android.\\" One will not regret purchasing this CD; so do yourself a favour and get it peeps !

B0008ISM40|4.0|My first impression of Trent Reznor was that he wrote explicit songs to shock his audience. Unfortunately my judgment was only based on one song, \\"Closer\\" (one line example from the song would be \\"I want to f*** you like an animal\\"), so I needed to listen to more music before I could condemn him as a dirty-talking singer. I decided to buy the dual-disc \\"With_Teeth\\" so that I could also get a background on the singer's discography and see some of his music videos.  <br /> <br />I first heard the song \\"Only\\" on MTV. I really like the synthesized beats because they get me dancing. Reznor's voice is a lot more pleasant than most metal \\"screamers\\", and its rhythm also gets me moving. \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" sounds eerie but soothing despite the intentional out-of-tune piano accompaniment. \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" has harsh, quick synth tones in the background that mesh well with the bass guitar. The only kind of \\"dirty talk\\" I could detect was to add anger or tension to the songs, and those gave more meaning and feeling to the lyrics.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|It always amazes me how people who collect Star Wars memorabilia always get upset when a product they previously purchased is re-released in a fashion that doesn't give them something \\"more\\". Some of the early negative reviews point strongly to the fact that these collectors or fans think that the Star Wars product world is geared solely towards their needs as a collector without thinking about a consumer who doesn't sleep in his 25 year old pair of Boba Fett Underoos. I am a huge Star Wars Collector and fan myself and I would ask the original critics of this DVD release who think that Lucasfilm is \\"CASHING IN\\" need to explore another possible motivation for this release.<br /><br />Come on folks, this set sold at a lower price point, now with an SRP of $49.98 versus the $69.98 original release SR, so that more people who maybe couldn't afford the first set or were on the fence as to spending that much money can now purchase this one.<br /><br />Does that scenario maybe make a little sense over the conspiracy theory that LFL LTD is only trying to make money off of collectors?<br /><br />Hey you can always wait for the HD-DVD and Blu-Ray versions.<br /><br />I don't know, this is only my opinion and I could be wrong.
B00005JO0J|5.0|A great movie for anyone who likes movies, Serenity has action, adventure, comedy, and some superb writing and acting going for it. The action sequences are intense, tight, and have to be seen on the big screen - DVD just won't do them justice. That said, I know I'm getting the DVD as soon as it comes out, so I can finally hear the lines I missed because the audience in the theater was laughing or gasping.
B000B0WODA|5.0|We all came to discover franz ferdinand last year with there debut self titled album. A collection of catchy guitar hooks, Creative lyrics, and Alex Kapranos stylish voice. Everyone thought this was the pinacle of FF's career. Enter: You could have it so much better. This album has everything for the old fans of FF and new listeners (if they are any). I am gonna recomend this CD to everybody i see. Bottom line, this album is in many ways superior to the origional. The album of the year!

B00003CXBH|5.0|After several viewings of this film, the very core of its meaning seems to be borne by these few words from the script:  Cardinal Altamirano: And you have the effrontery to tell me that this slaughter was necessary?  Cabeza: I did what I had to do. Given a legitimate purpose which you sanctioned, I would have to say yes. In truth, yes.  Hontar: You had no alternative, your Eminence. We must work in the world. The world is thus.  Cardinal Altamirano: No, senhor Hontar. Thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it.  The Cardinal's final words are dedicated to those of us who remain blithely convinced that history and human events are mere relics of school rooms, divorced from the critical choices of our present which the future must bear.  Cardinal Altamirano's last sentence is intensified by his unexpected reappearance in an unusual final scene following hard upon the end of film credits, unseen by most theater patrons as they hasten toward the auditorium exits. He offers no preachment. He speaks not a word. His world-weary eyes engage us directly, and we know the meaning of this melancholy stare beyond utterance.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Wow!  That is my one word description.  I went through the emotional range on this movie which seems to be a rare occasion over the past several years.  You definitely do not have to see the series to love the movie, also you do not have to be a sci-fi geek (though I am) to really like the movie.  I dragged someone with me that does not like sci-fi and she laughed, cried, and sat on the edge of her seat - very good sign!  I would recomend this movie to anyone that enjoys witty conversation, action, drama, and believes in love.

0380977273|4.0|Best friends Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade were born 2 minutes apart, Will one minute before midnight on Oct 30 and Jim one minute after midnight on Oct 31, and their different personalities reflect that well.  And each is tested in different ways when Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show comes to Green Town, IL shortly before their 14th birthday.  Characters from the carnival compliment the overall creepy atmostphere, from the Dust Witch to the Illustrated Man, Mr. Dark himself.<br /><br />Bradbury's unique writing style perfectly sets the tone for this spooky tale of boyhood and wishes.  While reading it, I was reminded of other characters from newer books, especially Mr. Leland Gaunt, the proprietor of Needful Things, from Stephen King's book.  And while some passages near the end of the book are a bit long-winded, it didn't detract much from a great spooky story, and one with a lot of insight into what it's like to be 13.
6303483712|5.0|All within 24 hours, Richard Linklater captures the conversation between two traveling companions on a train and through the historic and bohemian cityscape of Vienna.  Ethan Hawke (Jesse) and Julie Delpy (Celine) play the two romantics as they stroll down the streets of Vienna as they find out about themselves as well as of each other.  BEFORE SUNRISE is one of those films about self-actualizing and self-discovery.  Yes, there is a lot of talk and less action, but it is a simple film with an exchange in ideas and philosophizing from each of the actors, which makes the film so entrancing.  The film has a Woody Allen (\\"Annie Hall\\") and Rob Reiner (\\"When Harry met Sally\\") feel to it, but without too much angst and whining.<br /><br />The characters in BEFORE SUNRISE are the most interesting aspect of the film.  One may consider these two individuals as complete opposites, Jesse, a drifter who takes a European trek, Celine, a French graduate student visiting a relative.  Although that may be the case, it is the dialogue that they engage in, which is absolutely timeless.  Jessse appears to be the pragmatic and skeptic type, while Celine appears to be the hopeful and optimistic type who is open to outside influence.  For the most part, the content of the film is universal, the connection that is made between two people regardless of what geographical region they come from.  The characters make reference to each of their respective countries, U.S. and France, and their cultures as well social quirks that have left an impression on their lives.<br /><br />Linklater's direction and Kim Krizan's screenplay gives BEFORE SUNRISE a natural look.  The handheld camera method as well as the quick cuts and long shots, such as when Jesse and Celine stand inside a listening room as the needle drops playing Kate Bloom's \\"Come Here,\\" is effective.  In addition, the actual setting, Vienna, the initial backdrop of the film is captured, which romanticizes the image that Europe is the place where the young seek refuge before their rite of passage - taking a trek after college or study abroad, etc.<br /><br />BEFORE SUNRISE is a film that may take several viewings to get into.  It is not for the viewer that cannot sit still and listen to.

B00005JOHU|5.0|- REVIEW<br /><br />For everyone who says their job is rough, whether it's for being a janitor, pizza delivery man, or being one of the half-wits that worked in cubicles, YOU try working as a free-lancing international arms dealer!  In that profession, one thing's clear: you screw up, you get shot.  Nicholas Cage gives a nonchalant, yet superb performance in the most nihilistic film I've seen this year, \\"Lord of War.\\"  Dark and violent with black humor that effectively blend the course of the content, this is the kind of film that would make Kurt Vonnegut proud...if he watches films with rarely sedative themes.<br /><br />The film starts in a field of used bullets, and Nicholas Cage as Yuri stands in the middle of it, surrounding by the sounds of gunfights.  Yuri is an arms dealer, and he talks to the audience about his profession.  He's not trying to teach you a lesson about his experience, he's just talking about his experience as it is.  In a fashionable narrative (the same narrative that people in amazon.com are downsizing about), Yuri strolls down to memory lane when he first came to America in the 80s, and later sees his first sight of gunshots in a restaurant, leading to his fascination of selling guns.<br /><br />As years passed when he worked as a lackey in a practice to sell guns, Yuri then becomes a sole proprietor of an arms dealing business.  With his gifted talent of negotiating deals and getting out of trouble, he alone travels from one corrupted country to another, selling off his \\"merchandise\\" to some of the most notorious dictators in world.  At the same time, he's playing multiple lives not only for the customers but for his family, besides his brother, who doesn't know his profession.<br /><br />Because he's working in a black business, there's always the \\"Zenigata\\" that tries to stop this \\"Lupin\\" from commiting more crimes. Ethan Hawke plays a CIA agent who's on the hunt to find Yuri and arrest him for arms smuggling, though Yuri's always one step ahead by hiding the evidence and make him look wholesome.  Even when Yuri gets away from the CIA, he can't get away with the fact that his job is the most hellish thing he must deal with and it alienates him from his family, but he can't help it, because he's good with it.<br /><br />This is a heavy tale coming from Yuri.  Whether he's at Columbia or Liberia, there are graphic killings and massacres happening (and they are based on actual events), and it was all thanks to the guns he sold.  But he never questions how customers are using the weapons, since it would hurt his business, and by the end of the day, it's all about the business.  He should be considered a bad person for selling arms to criminal countries, but then we're also living in criminal countries.  That's what's so nihilistic about this movie: it subliminally shows what the US and other 'civil' countries are doing even before Yuri sold his first gun.  As cruel as this movie shows, it's a common practice that continues to reach massive profits, at the cost of massive casualties.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that \\"Lord of War\\" is also hilarious.  Yep, despite the violent elements, the movie has a wicked sense of humor.  There are many moments in this movie that laughed my butt off: the scene where Yuri and his family have to become Jewish, even though they are Ukranians; Yuri giving his brother a line of pot to sniff before sending him to rehad; a weapons convention (??); and the vicious moments that deal between Yuri and the high leader of Liberia, whose played by Kareem Sa---I mean, Eammon Walker (Damn you, OZ).  Even with its funny moments, it doesn't stray far from being so brutal, and by the end of the movie, the feeling of laughter and sorrow is thought-provoking.<br /><br />The problems with this movie?  Well, more plot could've been involved in Yuri's youth, and the ending could be better without the view of sentimentality.  And that's it, really.<br /><br />\\"Lord of War\\" is a sleeper hit, andit's unfortunate that not many people have give this movie a viewing consideration. these people have missed out on the sardonic writing and brilliant concept.  Don't you be the one to miss out on this shocking film, so go out and see \\"Lord of War\\"; it might shoot you in the heart (figuratively speaking).<br /><br />This is Del Keyes, saying \\"Guns are bad, unless they're worth something.\\"ewing consideration. these people have missed out on the sardonic writing and brilliant concept.

0060872675|4.0|\\"Where's My Cow?\\" is a companion book to Terry Pratchett's latest Discworld novel, \\"Thud!\\".  Or, rather, it is three books in one.  It is the children's book that his grace the Duke of Ankh-Morpork Sir Samuel Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, reads without fail every evening to his son, young Sam.  And it is the book that Sam Vimes turns the children's story into (after all, why should a city child be read tales about moo-cows and oink-pigs when there are critters like Foul Ole Ron and Coffin' Henry he is much more likely to encounter?).  And surrounding these, it is fundamentally a book about Sam Vimes reading a book to his son, a sweet tale of a complex man trying to be a good father.  There is enough self-referentiation in this very slender volume to make a post-modern literary critic dizzy and gibber about meta-fiction and meta-meta-fiction.  For the Pratchett/Discworld fan, there are a least a few treasures hidden in the illustrations -- such as that portrait of a bearded, black-hatted gentleman on the wall of young Sam's room.  And what is that medal worn by Foul Ole Ron?  Bugrit!

0553573403|5.0|Fantasy novels come in all shapes, sizes, and styles. At times, the market has been well overflooded with selections, and not all of them have been quality. In 1996, amongst the loads of rubbish, came a novel that not only ensorcelled readers with its brilliance, but created a new measuring stick for all subsequent works. George R.R. Martin's A GAME OF THRONES (and the rest of the Song of Fire & Ice saga), is very nearly a genre all its own. It is a masterpiece that breaks new ground and boundaries, yet retains everything that readers love about fantasy in the first place.<br /><br />I can't begin to imagine how George R.R. Martin came up with this story. I would guess that it must have taken him years. The tale is so well placed and developed that even the most fastidious readers can find few, if any, flaws. Add to this the narrative, which is second to none, and the story reads more like a wonderful movie than a book. You'll flip pages faster than you ever thought possible.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin creates within the reader a passionate hatred for the villains, and immense love for the heroes. Anytime an author can elicit such strong emotion, he/she has done his job. George R.R. Martin does this like no other author I've read. At times you will become so angry that you literally wish you could physically kill the antagonists. The reader will find himself so engrossed within the atmosphere and storyline that he/she will very nearly want to cheer out loud or scream in anger.<br /><br />The setting of A GAME OF THRONES is amazing, and George R.R. Martin does no small job of pulling you within and making you feel it firsthand. He is a writer of extraordinary talent, and the world he has created will stay with you long after you have finished the book.<br /><br />As you can tell, I have nothing but positive things to say about A GAME OF THRONES. Although I have given no spoilers (I never do when reviewing fiction), I do very much hope you consider picking this one up. I always envy those that have yet to read it for the very first time. It truly is a masterpiece, and well worth the 800+ pages.this one up. I always envy those that have yet to read it for the very first time. It truly is a masterpiece, and well worth the 800+ pages.
B00004R9A4|3.0|I remember loving this movie when I was a kid, but I just watched it with my four year old, and I was a little disappointed.  It is not nearly to the caliber of Mary Poppins, to which it is often compared.  The humor and setting are a lot darker, set as it is during World War II, and there is an under-current of anti-clericalism and of mass violence that is unsettling for a children's film. <br /> <br />Others may find the animated sequence to be a high note.  I thought it was long and tedious. <br /> <br />What was better than remembered was the Portobello Road dance sequence, which I thought was truly ahead of its time.  There is break-dancing, and even the beginnings of a moon walk dance move.  It wouldn't surprise me if this is where Michael Jackson picked up the idea for his Billy Jean dance moves. <br /> <br />I would definitely not recommend this for 4 year old girls.  I think it skews a little older and is probably more appealing for boys than girls. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001ELL|4.0|Many Kiss fans were quick to dismiss Dynasty as a disco Rock sell-out, but although that may be true, it sure is top notch in its genre. The hit single \\"I was made for lovin' You\\" became Kiss' all-time biggest single (that's right, it was bigger then \\"Rock n Roll all Night\\", \\"Beth\\" or \\"Hard Luck Woman\\") . Much of this disco/pop Rock influence was brought in by assisting song writers, notably D. Child, who would latter co-write songs with other famous artists such as Bon Jovi. <br />Paul Stanley brought in new material such as the near-hit tuneful pop rocker <br />\\"Sure Know Something\\" and the under rated \\"Magic Touch\\".  <br />Criss was, as always good for a tune in the song \\"Dirty Living\\", witch portrays his desire to leave the Rock n' Roll life Style. With the repeated line \\"I can't wait any longer to set my self free\\". Although this song casts a shadow over the bands unison,  it is still one of Peter's better compositions.  <br />The Shining star on this album is Mr. Ace Frehley. Ace includes three tracks on this album and they are some of the strongest. The cover of the Rolling Stones song \\"2000 Man\\" tops the original and \\"Hard Times\\" as well as \\"Save your Love\\" are as strong as any other Frehley written piece.  <br />The supposed ring leader of the band, Gene Simmons, was notably absent on Dynasty, featuring only two cuts, \\"Charisma\\" and \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" both of witch could have been better songs if not for the glossy production and Simmons' lack of Focus. <br />This is certainly no \\"Love Gun\\" or \\"Destroyer\\" but it is still an immensely enjoyable product.   <br /> <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is great. I have never seen the show before, but I loved the movie. I watched it about 3 times. On the 3rd time my 3.5 yr old daughter watched it and fell in love with it. She then started to watch it at least 3 times a day. Then my (at the time) 9 month old son started to watch it with her. Now he is going to be 1 yr (oct 14) and he loves the movie. Its the only movie he will watch. He even tries to sing. I highly recommend this film.
B000B0WODA|5.0|What an album. I'm addicted to this. It's got a load more material than the first one. Kicks out with The Fallen, which doesn't sound much like Franz Ferdinand because of its distorted guitars, and the riff (which may be quite a huge blow because of its quick key changes on the first listen). The Fallen is an instant classic, one of my first three favourites on the album. <br /> <br />From that track you see the band's style changed a lot. The music is heavier, and now its open to more people. The only issue is the lyrics are even worse than before -- But some are pretty good, anyway, and the music is great too. The guitar and drums on that track are excellent, and so are the background vocals -- \\"Woo-hoo!\\" or something like that. <br /> <br />Do You Want To is a big hit, and it is pretty nice, though in my opinion sometimes the melody is really screwed up. Then comes This Boy, with nice riffs, and OK song. And then Walk Away, the soon-to-be single, with a great melody. I love this song. Then comes Evil And A Heathen, a quite heavy song that is just, in my opinion, a bridge to the next part of the album. You're The Reason I'm Leaving has got a nice riff, again, and good melody, great song.  <br /> <br />Eleanor Put Your Boots Back On is a fun song to play on guitar, and this, as well as Walk Away, has got some Beatles influence. Then comes Well That Was Easy, a classic song, I love the ending. What You Meant is a song I haven't got much yet, I'll talk about that later on, but is for me, right now, kind of another bridge. Then there is I'm Your Villain, good song, I expected more from it but it's good anyway, however, I don't know why the hell did Alex Kapranos say the riff sounded like \\"a Smells Like Teen Spirit kind of thing\\".  <br /> <br />You Could Have It So Much Better is, right now, my favourite song on this album. You can see the lyrics are evolving, and the guitar playing is more noticed here. Great track. I love it. Then there is Fade Together, a song I don't like much, and Outsiders, with a nice rhythm.  <br /> <br />Great album. I love it. I listen to it a lot all day long. I know my opinion on some songs will change, but it'll always be great for me, I'm sure. This is also a hard album to get into, because some songs take quite a few listens and it gets very mindblowing at some points, and the riffs change a lot and there are many key changes. Dude, it took me more to get into this one than into Dark Side Of The Moon by Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a great album everybody should check out, even if you didn't like the first one.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|Damn you Walter hill,<br /><br />You were suppossed to put together a directors cut of all the extra scenes we kids saw on t.v. when we watched this awesome movie in the 70's. I knew that scene with Cleon at the beginning was gonna be there where he picks the 9 delagates and tells ajax to \\"just soldier\\". It was NOT there, is there any extra stuff? I don't know I can hardly look at this so called directors cut, it has comics and bad CGI, why not just put jar jar in it and make a pre-quel. In your intro Mr. hill you say you don't like special editions, well that sir is because you do NOT know how to do one. There is a game, a re-make in the works dolls, soundtrack, I own this movie now on laser disc and 2 dvd's, also last time they showed it here in portland (and they do show it alot) I dressed up and so did alot of folks. So there is all that and yet you still could not put in all the extra scenes you shot. The fans want longer, and the teaser for the dvd said deleted scenes, where the damn are they? No commentary, and this widscreen edition is not widescreen on my t.v.<br /><br />You have alot to answer for and it wont be pretty if you ever meet some fans from Portland. We will raid on you Walter Hill your ultimate edition SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I got introduced to 'Death Cab for Cutie' through this album, so I don't have any perspective to compare it to their earlier work 'Transatlanticism'. On its own merit, I think this is a fabulous album, packed to the gills with hum-able songs. DCfC deliver amazing pop hooks. Same thing can not be said of Gibbard's lyrics. They veer into faux darkness frequently and sometimes are too frivolous to have any real emotion. But on the whole, this is a worthy stop for a band marching towards real greatness.
B000268QB2|5.0|Magnificent debut.  Personally, I'm not real enamored of the current UK \\"pop\\" scene.  Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, Killers.  Too much fashion and not enough substance.  I don't trust bands that appear on too many magazine covers.  But that's just me.  Keane, on the other hand, comes across as the real deal.  A band, not a fashion statement.  This album just sparkles from start to finish.  Title couldn't be more accurate either.  From the depths of rainy Mondays to the highs of new love, the band captures a broad range of emotion.  Great music.  Great lyrics.  Sincere.  Ugly cover, God bless 'em.
B000AV2G3I|4.0|Well, just as \\"Lennon Legend\\" improved on \\"The John Lennon Collection\\", \\"Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon\\" improves on \\"Lennon Legend\\". Of course the big plus here is two discs. I for one think it's about time that one of the most important artists from one of the most important bands, who's been dead almost a quarter-century got a 2-disc \\"Best Of\\". Anyway, I believe every track from the prior collections makes it on here, as well as the numerous missing songs. As I look at the tracklist here, I forget how much great material John had after the Beatles split. Pretty impressive really. Obviously this is 90% excellent, but my favorites are \\"Jealous Guy\\", \\"Instant Karma!\\", \\"Nobody Told Me\\", \\"#9 Dream\\", and of course \\"Imagine\\". Another great one is \\"Beautiful Boy (darling boy)\\", which includes my favorite lyrics of his \\"life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans\\". How true is that? Overall, I'd have to say this package lives up to its title.
0156421178|5.0|Homage to Catalonia is an exceptional and facinating book that tells the story of the Spanish Revolution in the eyes of the great writer George Orwell. Orwell, through out his book, tell the story of an ideal that later seems to disapear in the face of a communist power stuggle. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Anarchism, orwell or revolution.
B00005A0N5|5.0|As on any Nightwish CD, there is very little sense of a journey or a progression as the tracks go by.  Instead, expect a collection of high quality songs that sound somewhat like a 'Best of' release, since there is so much individual quality.  The tracks are in some cases brilliant (Walking in the Air, Phantom and the Opera, The Riddler) and in all cases very good.  I would single out 'Walking in the Air,' as the highlight of the whole album, a ballad of massive proportions that goes from slow to fast seamlessly and will have you humming the melody for days.  Not far behind this masterpiece is my second favorite, 'The Phantom and the Opera' which is similar but faster and a little heavier with the catchiest chorus you'll ever hear.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the best part of the album though, and what makes it their best release, is that all of the songs are good.  Even in Wishmaster (their second best CD) and definitely in Century Child and Once, there are songs you just wish were not on the CD.  Not on Oceanborn.  Every track seems unique and there is very little repetition of themes and motifs from song to song.  The album does not feel forced like the aforementioned releases do at times, and perhaps it should come as no surprise that Oceanborn is the most heavily featured album on Bestwishes, their real 'Best of' collection.    <br /> <br />Bottom line: if you want to buy a full length Nightwish album, this is the place to start.
B000AV2G3I|4.0|If you dont have any Lennon in your collection, get this. This is the best compilation available in the market..so far. If you have bought Shaved Fish, The lennon Collection, Once upon a time, Lennon Legend, I got bad news for you: here is yet another compilation. How long before we get the \\"Ultimate Lennon\\" or \\"Gold Lennon\\" is anybody guess. The only thing I dislike about this is the sequence of the tracks. They should have put them in Chronological order. The order makes no sense at all. You may want to get this and burn the tracks in the proper order to get a better understanding of Lennon career. No tracks from the Toronto album. It could be better.
0606037225|5.0|The true identify of Richard Bachman did not get out until the publication of Thinner, Bachman's fifth book.  These first four Bachman novels were the sorts of books you might find in a grocery store or - more likely - never have come across at all because they weren't really marketed at all - at Stephen King's request.  Naturally, they didn't sell all that well - not until the true author was revealed, of course.  These represent an interesting cross-section of King's writing life.  Rage and The Long Walk are truly early King novels, Roadwork emerged in between the novels 'Salem's Lot and The Shining, and The Running Man was published in 1982, the product of a mere seventy-two hours of writing.  They are quite different novels, yet they all share a common theme - a man displaced by society and doing what he can to combat the forces closing in around him.<br /><br />This collection is about the only place you can find the novel Rage these days.  After the Columbine tragedy, Stephen King basically had all copies of Rage pulled from the shelves.  The novel features a high school student who wigs out, shoots two teachers, and holds his class hostage for several hours.  The real heart of the story is the way the students react to their captor during their ordeal; they go way beyond merely sympathizing with him.  King really breaks down the emotional walls of these characters, mining some of the real issues that teenagers have to deal with in their lives.  To me, this novel is raw but instructive, surreal yet amazingly open and honest, and well worth reading.<br /><br />If you ask me, The Long Walk (written while King was a college freshman) may well be the most fascinating novel King has ever written.  It's a disarmingly simple tale centered on a seemingly mundane activity, yet in King's masterful hands The Long Walk burrows into the core of a number of characters, lays down miles of metaphors about the human condition, and absolutely mesmerizes you with its emotional force and power.  The contestants (all but one of whom will die - and they know it) do a lot of talking while they're walking; most of them dance around the \\"why\\" issue, but we see clues to some of the reasons as each lad draws closer and closer to death.  Cockiness turns to anger, fear, shock, and just about every other kind of dark emotion you can imagine.  The boys are stripped bare in both body and mind as the Walk goes on and on.  Through his characters, King is basically asking the reader how he/she will face death when it comes.  Will you freeze up early on?  How long will you fight to stay alive after you've pushed your body far beyond the breaking point?  Will you lie down and accept your fate, or will you lose control and lash out at your perceived enemies?  I could read this novel over and over again without ever growing tired of it.  It's just endlessly fascinating and illuminating.<br /><br />Roadwork represented an attempt on King's part to go straight, to prove he could write a mainstream novel.  In its essence, Roadwork is the story of a man pushed beyond his means of coping with change.  We the readers basically watch Bart Dawes go insane as the days pass.  We watch him lie to his wife and to himself, drink himself into nightly stupors, procure destructive objects from dangerous men, and plot revenge on those who have taken away the few things in life he could cling to.  At the center of his problem is his son Charlie, who died of a brain tumor three years earlier; George can't understand why his son had to die, and he can't bear the thought of his home, Charlie's home, being destroyed.  Even as we watch Dawes do some terrible things, we can't help but sympathize with a man so beaten down by the cruel vagaries of life.  King has said that Roadwork was in some ways a product of the death of his mother.  The book served as a vehicle to let him work through his own emotional issues over his loss.  Why does a loved one have to die?  That question permeates this novel.  It's a very personal story, but it is one almost any adult reader can relate to very well.  It's a surprisingly impressive exploration of emotional disintegration.<br /><br />With The Running Man, we have a complete novel that was written in only three days - and was published with almost no changes.  Obviously, The Running Man is not your typical Stephen King novel.  Action is the gas pedal, and King floored it from page one until the very end.  Surprisingly, though, there is some pretty decent characterization of the main player - and a heavy undertone of social commentary worked into the book.<br /><br />The setting is a future America in which society has totally fractured, leaving those on the wrong side of the tracks doomed to a life of misery.  Ben Richards personifies that social inequity.  Unable to provide for his wife and sick little girl, there is only one way out for him - the Network Games.  No show satisfies the bloodlust of the public like The Running Man, and a man of Richards' temperament is just the kind of player the show is looking for.  Richards proves himself a worthy contestant indeed - the Game in fact, will never be the same.

1567184855|5.0|The case studies were so interesting to me.  The journey a soul takes when it leaves the body is probably incomprehensible by the human mind, but Dr. Newton is able to hypnotize people that can explain things in a way that our human mind can understand. It's just fascinating stuff to me.  It gave me so much hope for life after death and helped take away my fear of death.
0451197968|3.0|We've all heard the story about the writer who booked himself into a hotel on Friday and walked out Monday morning with a complete book in his hands (it was the Bible - he'd stolen it from the room).  With The Running Man, though, we have a complete novel that was written in only three days - and was published with almost no changes to that original draft.  Is it even possible to write a decent novel in three days?  Yes - but, obviously, The Running Man is not your typical Stephen King novel (which is a large part of the reason it was published under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman).  Action is the gas pedal, and King floored it from page one until the very end.  Surprisingly, though, there is some pretty decent characterization of the main player - and a heavy undertone of social commentary worked into the book.<br /><br />The setting is a future America in which society has totally fractured, leaving those on the wrong side of the tracks doomed to a life of misery.  Ben Richards personifies that social inequity - unable to find work because of his antiestablishment ways (for some reason, he didn't want to keep working at a job which exposed the old family jewels to dangerous amounts of radiation leakage), he can't take care of his family - his wife keeps turning tricks for money, and his 18-month-old daughter has the flu and will likely die without proper medicine.  There is only one way out for him - the Network Games.  The whole nation is fascinated with the Free-Vee game shows, shows such as Treadmill to Bucks or Swim With the Crocodiles.  No show satisfies the bloodlust of the public like The Running Man does, though, and a man of Richards' temperament is just the kind of player the show is looking for.<br /><br />The game is simple.  Richards is paraded out in front of the cameras, castigated as a dangerous low-life, then turned loose on the streets.  A few hours later, the show's Hunters begin going after him.  Richards wins money for every hour he can avoid capture (and by capture, I mean bloody death - broadcast live to the whole country), with bonuses for any cops killed along the way.  Best of all, the viewing public can win money for themselves by turning him in if they see him.  Richards proves himself a worthy contestant indeed - the Game in fact, will never be the same.<br /><br />This is one of my least favorite King novels, primarily because it's so action-oriented.

0802130208|1.0|This is the worst book I have EVER read in my entire life, including the crap crammed down my throat in school, including fuel detergent pamphlets while waiting at the Jiffy Lube, including newspaper editorials on the politics and issues of our day, including the backs of cereal boxes, and including the \\"do not eat\\" warnings on silica packets in my new shoes.  I hated every single flipping page of this overblown and overhyped crap that as soon as I finished it--and I stuck with it, so agonizingly long, right to the end--I tossed it in the woodburning stove and giggled blissfully as the pages curled in consuming fire.<br /><br />This book is not comedy, straight or black or slapstick or satirical.  It is not a work of genius or intellect.  It's a rambling screed by a rejected and untalented hack, pushing himself and his own directionless existence onto the fictional page.  It's a glorification of everything that's wrong with the America we're stuck with, sloth and waste and taking deep pride in the lack of ambition and calling it independence.  This garbage holds up lack of personal pride, absence of self-resepct and absence of personal self-worth as worthy attributes, something that is honorable to strive for.  It glorifies the marginal existence, and the conscious decision to live one.<br /><br />Make a statement for literature.  Buy a copy and throw it in the fire, down the sewer, into a chipper, in the recycle bin, please.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I wouldn't expect anything less from Death Cab, but I must admit that I was at least a little bit skeptical of their label switch.  After putting out so many amazing songs under Barsuk, I wasn't sure what would happen after they entered the mainstream world; boy was my doubt unnecessary!  As always, DCFC never fails to amaze me.  Their soothing sound and incredible presence in every song--YES, EVERY SONG--is beyond anything I have ever heard.  \\"Plans\\" is a collection is some things very much similar to the old Death Cab, and some things very much amazing that Death Cab has developed.  All in all, a great purchase; you will be singing along until the next album comes along. <br /> <br />&lt;u>Breakdown of the Songs&lt;/u> <br />1. Marching Bands of Manhattan: (10/10) A great, uplifting song.  A great way to start the album. <br />2. Soul Meets Body: (10/10) I abolsutely love this song.  It's incredibly catchy and incredibly likeable.  One of the best on the album.   <br />3. Summer Skin: (8/10) This song may seem a little repititive after awhile, but it's still a great song nonetheless. <br />4. Different Names for the Same Thing: (10/10) Very deep, empathetic song.  I feel a lot like this sometimes, so I can connect to it. <br />5. I Will Follow You into the Dark: (10/10) A lovely song; reminds me a lot of \\"Photobooth\\" and \\"Expo '86\\". <br />6. Your Heart Is an Empty Room: (9/10) A great song again; a lot like the songs off of \\"Transatlanticism\\". <br />7. Someday You Will Be Loved: (7/10) This is probably the only song on the album that I don't LOVE, per se.  It's still a good song, the first few times.  You might find yourself skipping it every now and again. <br />8. Crooked Teeth: (10/10) I love the lyrics to this song. <br />9. What Sarah Said: (10/10) Beautiful song, beautiful lyrics, amazingly emotional.  A great song on this particular album, much like \\"Passenger Seat\\". <br />10. Brothers on a Hotel Bus: (11/10) My favorite song on the album.  I'm sure you'd like it too.  Very DCFC. <br />11. Stable Song: (10/10) As always, ending the album with a very meaningful song.  It never stops making you think, and the chords are lovely. <br /> <br />Amazing album; go out and GET IT!   <br />
0740748475|5.0|Bill Watterson likely did not envision the impact and scope he would have through the 10-year run of the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip. \\"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes\\", all 23 pounds of it, preserves this legacy without cheapening it (Mr. Watterson refused the lure to see his creation perpetuated through recycled mugs, t-shirts, calendars, mouse pads, and swimsuits!).<br /><br />Though there are some previously unreleased drawings, I'm looking forward to rediscovering old favorites, still dimly remembered, and having this collection to peruse on winter afternoons or lazy summer days.<br /><br />Mr. Watterson captured many of the fragile, fleeting emotions of childhood through the adventures of Calvin and his tiger Hobbes. Calvin's many adventures with girls, teachers, bullies, and, of course, his parents, chronicle that ephemeral stage of life when the world remains at bay and we live in the present. Best of all, the author kept Calvin frozen in time, so that we never had to confront the sad fate of Puff the Magic Dragon when Jackie Paper no longer believed.<br /><br />In a sense, the memories conjured here are part of the collective consciousness of our culture, and their expression reminds us of the power of humor, friendship, and daydreaming.
B000002BHE|5.0|I actually don't own this album, but I think that \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" is one of the most brilliant pop songs ever made. The way Celine's vocals build with the instruments is amazing, and at the loud crescendo around (around 5 minutes in) where most singers would be lost in the noise, Celine's voice rises above in a way that only a handful of vocalists walking the planet could. The Titanic theme may be Celine's most recognizable and biggest hit song, but this song (and this album) are her best work to date.

0316172324|4.0|I heard a book review cum interview on NPR with the author. The social implications that they talked about in the show was definitely interesting, so I bought the book - its still on the best seller list, if it means anything to any one - and I couldnt put it down. Its one of the few non-fiction books that has had been rivetted. It is written in a very organised way, in very simple lay person terms and also explains every concept with examples. It demystifies, without reducing the respect for the phenomena. I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about social psychology.

B000003TAW|5.0|Very few albums can be labeled as classic. Weezer's blue album is one of them. Perfect pop hooks, distorted guitars, insightful and sometimes funny lyrics, catchiness, and the masterful production of Ric Ocasek. This album marked an era, created a genre, and inspired countless imitators (but as usual nothing is as good as the original).<br /><br />On a first listen, this album is instantly enjoyable. But also has the magic of letting you delve deeply into each song finding small details that make each track special. No filler tracks whatsoever, consistent from start to finish due mainly to the utter genius of Rivers Cuomo's songwriting and guitar skills.<br /><br />There are no musical passages pretending to show extreme musical skills, this album's beauty lies in its \\"simple\\" but very effective and pleasing hooks. The aforementioned does not mean that they are not good musicians as Weezer is one of the best sounding, tightest and energetic live shows I have ever seen. In fact a recent show inspired me for this review.<br /><br />A milestone of the 1990's it is right up there with Nevermind, Ten, Superunknown and other greats of the decade. It should be in everybody's record collection. At least for anyone who enjoys listening with an open mind and open ears.<br /><br />Cheers.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is one of the best hip-hop CDs I've ever heard.  Every song is great.  Any CD that can be listened to straight through deserves a 5.
B000002KDS|5.0|I bought this album at the age of 14. I was already hip to Alice, his high energy rock-n-roll, and the statements he was making with his outrageous lyrics. But once I put this on the turntable and cranked it up, that was it. After that, Alice Cooper was a GOD to me!! Someone mentioned Marylin Manson in a previous reveiw, well that clown isn't even in the same league as Alice-NOT EVEN CLOSE!! The pure, raw energy that is the Killer album will never be duplicated by ANY shock rocker PERIOD!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Incredible masterpiece that helps to better understand the life and meaning of Jesus Christ.  While it does not show many of the wonderful miricles He perfomed, it helped me better understand all the pain and suffering he went through.  Through reading the Gospels and watching The Passion of the Christ, everything came into synch of what He did.  It is slightly gruesome in aspects of his wipping, but Mel Brooks brilliantly captured Christ through it all. <br /> <br />The cast captured the hearts of many people causing tears to trickle down the faces.  The Passion definitally impacted the views that saw it through the emotion and the way that it was filmed in the Arabaic language with English subtitles.
080017948X|5.0|Spectacular fun!!.Not really a laugh out aloud comedy,but it's very interesting.Just think about what you'ed do if you got stuck in some time warp,reliving the same day over and over and over again.What a mind job huh? Bill murray and Andie MacDowell were just perfect for this movie. I have the original version dvd which contains both the wide and full screen versions of the movie,and both presentations were flawless.No complaints except for darn arlarm clock which was so annoying!
B00000I8UF|5.0|Why do we need yet another 5 star review of this brilliant LP?  Because not enough reviewers mention Bobby Timmons' piano, that's why!  This underrated but dazzling keyboardist not only plays some of his finest, most pure-silver solos here, but he provides a solid foundation to the whole band, the perfect ivory complement to Blakey.  Buy it and immerse yourself in even if you're not into the crash of drums or wail of horns.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I bought \\"Love and Theft\\" back when it first came out, listened to it a few times, but never really got into it. I think that may be because I had mostly listened to Dylan's earlier material such as Blonde on Blonde and Highway 61 Revisited and wasn't quite used to his \\"older voice\\". It's a voice that you may have to warm up to. On his recent records, Dylan certainly doesn't have the vocal range that he used to. But his singing style certainly accommodates it.    Recently, I've been on a Dylan binge so I pulled out Love and Theft again along with Time out of Mind. Hearing it for the first time in a few years was almost as if I'd never heard it before. Now, I can't get enough of this album! It's a warm, funny, delightful and rocking album like none other Dylan has ever recorded. Dylan assembled what is probably his best backing band ever (no slight to The Band intended) and produced an album with really memorable tunes. Whether playing blues, jazz or rock the band is always excellent. The songs are some of the best that Dylan has written in the past twenty years. Mississippi may be one of Dylan's finest songs ever.     \\"Got nothing for you, I had nothing before  Don't even have anything for myself anymore  Sky full of fire, pain pouring down  Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around\\"    It's one of the few downbeat songs on the album, which makes sense since it was actually written for Time out of Mind, a rather gloomy downbeat record. Summer Days is probably the closest thing to jazz that Dylan has ever done. Bye and Bye is (mostly) a sweet, simple love song. (\\"I'm singin' love's praises with sugar-coated rhyme.\\") Floater (Too Much To Ask) is one of my favorite songs on the album. It's kind of jazzy, but features an interesting violin \\"riff\\" too. High Water (For Charlie Patton) is also a highlight. My two favorite songs on the album are probably Honest With Me and Po' Boy. I think Po' Boy is one of the best songs Dylan has ever written. It's one of his brightest, most joyous, humorous songs ever. Cry A While is a great blues song, with great guitar playing from (I think) Charlie Sexton.    In all, Love and Theft is an excellent album. Musically, it may be Dylan's best. His band is excellent, and the songs are some of the most melodic that he's ever recorded. The lyrics are excellent as always, and there are many memorable lines that will stick in your mind. The only thing that might be an obstacle is Dylan's gravelly voice. However, you pretty much have to appreciate his voice to be a Dylan fan in the first place, so that shouldn't be an issue. I would highly recommend Love and Theft to anyone who wants the best of Dylan's recent recording work.
0812932293|4.0|True, the book won't make you a millionaire overnight, but it does offer insight into Branson's innovative mind.  It is as entertaining as it is informative.  I do agree that it lags towards the end, focusing too much on the BA situation.  Overall, a very good read.

B00005OWEG|1.0|Although many films from the 1970s have aged well--Coppola's two \\"Godfather\\" pictures come to mind--this movie is too much a product of its time to hold much appeal for contemporary viewers. Coppola attempts to retell Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" in the Vietnamese jungle. Instead of creating a surreal journey from civilization to savagery, however, Coppola creates a confusing, didactic muddle of disconnected scenes. Add to the mix several mannered performances, heavy-handed dialogue, and a soundtrack that underscores all of Coppola's main ideas in broad, obvious strokes, and the result is an uninvolving movie about the corrosive effects of war. (The final 45 minutes are especially incoherent.) \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" does a far superior job of capturing the horror and moral ambivalence of the Viet Nam soldier's experience.
B000005RS0|5.0|Of all the albums that Tina recorded from this time period forward this has always been my favorite. To me, Private Dancer was the perfect blend between the sound that Tina wanted to explore, mixed with the right amount of grit from Tina's \\"we never do anything nice and easy\\" days.<br /><br />The rockish tracks of Better Be Good To Me, Show Me Some Respect and What's Love Got To Do With It, mesh with the more R & B flavored remake of Let's Stay Together, and I Can't Stand The Rain.<br /><br />This release keeps getting better first with the addition of Help, and now a few more songs recorded in the period before the Private Dancer sessions, with Rock n Roll Widow a standout and a bit of role reversal for Tina.  3 extedned tracks of her biggest hits round out this re-release.<br /><br />What could make this album better still? The addition of some of the great cover songs (like Help) that Tina was doing in her live shows, just before she re-emereged as a mega star. Some of these tracks included; Rod Stewart's Tonight's The Night & Hot Leggs, and the Rolling Stone's Brown Sugar. I'm sure they were recorded at some point.
0684853523|4.0|Very insightful both into the author, himself, as well as his style of writing.  Takes the fear and/or reluctance out of plunging in and getting started.  It's written as a series of flashbacks, so it's not preachy, nor does it follow a logical sequnce.  It's a kind of memoir (though short of a biography) on how he approaches writing, what he likes, and what he dislikes.

B00005JO0J|5.0|From the first minute to the very last, the movie Serenity simply does not let up. It is a roller-coaster of emotions, you won't go five minutes without laughing at something happening, or something being said, and you won't go a minute without wondering if everybody's gonna make it out alive from this escapade. You will laugh, you might cry, you will defnitely be shocked, but you will never be bored! This is simply movie-making at it's finest, and one of the best (if not THE best)  movies I've ever seen.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I went to the movie expecting a blowoff sci-fi, something taht would not even choke up three stars.  But I came out having seen what I consider to be the best movie ever.  Really, I am yet to see any movie that can match up to the plot and the action of Serenity. <br /> <br />I got so addicted to it I bout the show it used to be (Firefly) on DVD.  All I can say is that this movie was absolutly amazing!
B00006GO99|4.0|In 1962, bebop was on its way out the door, but Thelonious Monk's star was rising.  Having spent the better part of the previous decade signed to Riverside (where he moved from underground to somewhat more popularly known), he signed to Columbia Records' growing jazz department (it should be noted that all the praise that is often levied on Columbia for all this jazz they recorded should be tempered by noting how quickly they kicked these artists to the curb when they decided this music was not commercial enough).  Monk appeared to be happy to be signed to the label, as he took his working quartet (including Charlie Rouse on tenor sax, John Ore on bass and Frankie Dunlop on drums) into the studio to record this album, \\"Monk's Dream\\", which has an ecstatic energy to it that many Monk pieces lack in favor of introspection.    Perhaps the most telling is the title track and opener, \\"Monk's Dream\\"-- it's energetic, upbeat and exciting, with Monk's playing fractured and explosive and Rouse matching.  This pretty much sticks through the entire record, including the solo piano feature \\"Body and Soul\\", a stunning take on \\"Blue Bolivar Blues\\" (with a superb solo by Rouse) and \\"Bye-Ya\\", where Dunlop gets to show just what he's got in him.  Throughout, the playing is superb, the group interaction is near-psychic, and the mood is exciting and upbeat-- check out closer \\"Sweet and Lovely\\"-- Monk freely associates on the theme under Rouse's solo, responding to the soloist and gently urging him on while Ore and Dunlop lock with the leader.  The only exception to the mood of the record is the take of \\"Just a Gigolo\\", performed on solo piano, the only really moody piece on the record.  Nonetheless, the performance is breathtaking as Monk deconstructs the piece totally.    This reissue is remastered and adds four alternate takes (nearly 30 minutes of unreleased music) to the recording, and features a new liner notes essay as well as reprinting the original notes.    I'm of the opinion(and I seem to be in the minority) that Monk has done better than this one, but it's an awfully good album.  Recommended.
B00005JO0J|5.0|This is my first review here at Amazon, and technically, I view it as more of a response to some of the comments made about the film. First off, I'd like to say that I'm glad to see that no one is spoiling anything (at least in the reviews I read). <br /> <br />  One of the main criticisms I've seen on some other sites, is that one particular event (if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about) is 'unnecessary' or 'pointless'. I disagree. That scene was absolutely necessary--my own feeling was that it cast doubt over how the movie would turn out, but I'm sure we'll discover Joss's reasoning once the DVD comes out. Also, just because that scene happened, doesn't mean that there can't be any more Firefly. Things happen, people move on. It would be interesting to see how certain characters cope with the impact of it. And it serves as a reminder of just how good Whedon is at making you feel for what happens to the crew of Serenity. <br /> <br />  The other complaint I've seen, is that people feel the movie changed the tone of the show. I felt this is one of its stronger points. Relationships between people in close quarters change over time. All that time in a spaceship, stuck with the same walls, the same people--it's not going remain a paradise. I've had jobs, situations, etcetera, that I look back upon fondly, though by the time those situations were coming to a close, I felt glad to have them be over. <br />  The events in Serenity appear to happen some time after the final episode of Firefly, and a lot could happen in that time. The situation with River must have been slowly getting worse, as evidenced by the tension between Mal and Simon.  <br /> <br />  In short, you can pine for the old days, where everyone was all happy and sarcastic, or you can realize that people don't stay the same. We all change over time. <br /> <br />  As for the review, I feel that this is one of the best movies-which-were-based-on-a-TV-show that I've ever seen. It's wonderfully written, excellently acted, and beautifully scored. If you haven't watched Firefly (the show which it's based on), I would heartily recommend it. However, you could probably still enjoy the movie without any prior knowledge of the series. Whereas the TV show left me wanting more, Serenity has placated me (until the DVD, that is). I wouldn't mind more from this universe, but I'm definitely happy with what we got.
B00007E8V4|4.0|Once again SOAD beats out all the others. They have accomplished so much from their short music lifetime...well six years. They range between the cursefilled Fxck the System, and their softer side acoustic Roulette. Pick this up, or better yet, Steal it.  <br /> <br />Chic 'N' Stu 10/10 - Solid rock intro with funny and confusing lyrics. Well not really confusing, you should understand what its about. Its about advertisements, and pizza. Why, don't really know. The chorus is great, because it recites a bunch of toppings on a pizza, then cuts to advetisments and therapy. It has all the ingredients needed for a pizza pie. <br /> <br />Innervision 10/10 - When you reach the next song, you'll be amazed at what great work this song is. It talks about the third eye, aka your inner soul, and what it is capable of seeing. Beautiful lyrics and voice work by Serj. Long holding notes in the chorus and a good solid rock song. Terrific. <br /> <br />Bubbles 9/10 - Short little filler and to the point. Terrific guitar work and bouncy drumming. It would be a lot better if it was a little longer, but its ok the way it is. The title of it fits the song well, because at times it sounds like the tone is underwater. Cool addition as well. Won't be liked by everyone, but its a good treat. <br /> <br />Boom! 8/10 - Just can't get into it at all. Nothing sticks out besides chanting \\"Boom!\\" in the chorus. The verses are weak, just talking about political problems and other conflicts too. It is a little dull, convincing at parts, but thats it. Don't ask, but why was this the hit?  <br /> <br />Nguns 9/10 - Alright its a little more enjoyable then Boom! but it still lacks. The chorus reminds me of Question! from Mezmerize. Talks about teenagers and problems. I really like the drumming though. There is also an Arabic little note far into the song. Theres at least something interesting here. <br /> <br />A.D.D 10/10 - This should've been the hit. Like the little creepy high pitched guitar intro, then it cuts for a second, then explodes into a great rock fury. Another political message rage song. Love the drumming, and the snarling guitar at parts. Serj obviously likes to scream in this song. <br /> <br />Mr. Jack 8/10 - Reminds me of Boom! because it is so boring. The intro is cool, but then it just drags on and you just want it to end. You have a skip button right? Introduce it to this song. Cops are the target in this song. Slow and the chorus is like Nguns.  <br /> <br />I-E-A-I-A-I-O 9/10 - Love it. Tounge-twisting lyrics, fast paced drumming, and a weird tribal chant-like chorus. If you are fascinated about the words, look em up. The tounge-twisting lyrics are like a story, except the first one. Weird bells and tings from time to time, and just another stick out song. <br /> <br />36 7/10 - The king of all fillers. 46 seconds long and its all about televsion. It is their 36th song. If you think about it, what else would they do with a song called 36? If you leave your mind behind, there is a slight chance you can give this song slack. <br /> <br />Pictures 9/10 - Love the fast bass intro in the beginning. Another fast paced song, just like any other you've heard before. The part I like the most is the chorus, with the little tweaks in between and the little drumbeats. What else to say about the song? Umm, nothing really. <br /> <br />Highway Song 9/10 - Reminds of Pictures in a way, until the drumming intro is over. The tune suddenly changes into something a little more laid back. Actually, its a good song to listen to on the highway. It makes me feel like I'm in a car driving by myself, and it is at night, and there are barely any lights on. Forget about my story, just sit back, push the pedal, and listen to the song. <br /> <br />Fxck the System 10/10 - Love the gibberish filled lyrics, and the hard rock beat which brings back memories of their self titled album. The only lyrics I understand are War! and you know the other three. I had to look them up to understand what he said, and he actually is saying something. Another political song. <br /> <br />Ego Brain 7/10 - Ughh I can't stand this song one bit. Its too prissy and sounds like a love song. Its not like their original stuff, which bugs me a lot. Nothing to say but I dispise this song and I hope they go back to what they were doing  in the first place. <br /> <br />Thetawaves 8/10 - The only reason I show interest in this song is because its kind of like a barrier between Ego Brain and Roulette. It also has kind of a cool tune to it, unother like any other song. The only weird thing is the way it ends. It just stops, there is no end, its like it cuts off the song. <br /> <br />Roulette 4/10 - I don't think acoustic really fits these guys. Its an alright song, but IMO its not their style and it shouldn't be. It is like Ego Brain Part 2. Another kind of love song song. Ha. <br /> <br />Streamline 9/10 - Solid closer, yet nothing is really memorable like Aerials. Kind of like Ego Brain, but heavier, which I like. Its is a song you should definitely listen to, no matter what kind of style you like. Takes a while to adapt to, but its a clean finish to this one of a kind album. <br /> <br />STA! has accomplished a lot after 16 songs of rock and sadly, acoustic. But a definite purchase for any fan.
B000002KZA|4.0|Well, ladies and gents, this is my very first review, and I'm pleased to rate such a great disc.  As you all (should) know, CONSTRUCTION TIME AGAIN (henceforth regarded as CTA) is Depeche Mode's third album, and it's certainly an evolution in style and content.  Definitely Depeche Mode's most political album (just look at the cover art!), CTA has a slew of songs featuring aggressive social commentary backed up by fierce synthesized beats.  Let's review each song in turn: <br />1. \\"Love, In Itself\\" <br />One of my favourites--lovely, catchy beat with a great sing-along chorus.  The blips near the end are a bit jarring, however, but the overall song is smashing.  9/10 <br />2. \\"More Than a Party\\" <br />Meh, I'm not too impressed with this one.  Lyrics are rather dull, and the beat is too repetitive.  4/10 <br />3. \\"Pipeline\\" <br />I expected this one to be atrocious based on many people's dislike of it, but this is one of the most entrancing, enthralling tracks on the CD.  I love the sampling and the synths, and the lyrics, though very red, are interesting to say the least.  10/10 <br />4. \\"Everything Counts\\" <br />Classic Depeche Mode.  Whenever I listen to this song, I *must* sing with it!  The chorus is extremely catchy, and I love the industrial beat!  10/10 <br />5. \\"Two Minute Warning\\" <br />Not too bad.  I like the \\"orange sky\\" imagery.  6/10 <br />6. \\"Shame\\" <br />Ooh, I like this one.  I instantly think of those \\"Save the Children\\" commercials.  Perfect synthesizers--especially that primitive flute/whistle like one!  8/10 <br />7. \\"The Landscape is Changing\\" <br />Trite lyrics but another catchy chorus you can't help but repeat...over and over again.  Wonderful synths.  7/10   <br />8. \\"Told You So\\" <br />A truly truculent track.  Very bleak and angsty.  8/10 <br />9. \\"And Then...\\" <br />One could certainly read \\"revolutionary communism\\" in this one, but it's very prettily sung in a subdued sort of way.  Interesting.  9/10 <br />10. \\"Everything Counts (Long Version)\\" <br />A bit too long.  I don't care for the repetition of \\"the handshake\\" and \\"the graph,\\" and it doesn't seem mixed very well.  7/10 <br /> <br />In sum, this album is worth a listen if you care for 80's synthesized music at all.  The lyrics are generally youthful, energetic, and passionate if a bit too idealistic at times, but the music more than makes up for them.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|I was disappointed with the film as a whole even though it started well for me.  I bought the DVD primarily because of what the film makers did on the South Park series as well as being a big fan of the Thunderbirds series. <br /> <br />The first thirty minutes of the film was great since it not only had the Thunderbird feel but with more edge and more hard core on the action sequence.  The film then subsequently faded and dragged on with the story meandering on around the lead character.  I was most disgusted with the love scene since it was irrelevant to the film but felt it was created just to turn people off.  I could do with vulgar but it was also crude for me and very repulsive. <br /> <br />Overall a very credible effort from the makers since it is really hard work putting together a feature length film with marionettes but their jokes and treatment may work fine with a thirty minute cartoon, it became quite unbearable when it went beyond an hour.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Though just a quirky and imperfect independent film, \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" obviously has struck a chord (nerve?) with many, seeing how there are already over 1100 viewer reviews on this site alone. I don't have time to read them all but I did make time to watch the movie, which I'm happy to report I survived unscathed (I had my doubts). In fact I think it merits at least 3.5 stars, 1) for daring not to follow a totally predictable formula and pattern, 2) for actors who all deserve a \\"thumbs up\\", 3) for piquing my interest in what it might be like to live in such a place as Idaho. Regarding the last point, it's always assumed that small-town or rural residents are often aspiring to acquire a more cosmopolitan sophistication, but no one ever considers the reverse. Having grown up near a major metropolitan area however, I'm awed by vast stretches of nothingness, and I dare say I'm not the only one. \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" gives me pause to mull over just such an upbringing, with unconventional family members to boot.<br /><br />As for the actual storyline of this movie; hey, you've got hundreds of other reviews to peruse, so you'd best get started. But you'll have to see the movie yourself, because \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is a tough one to second-guess just by reading others' opinions.
0521653975|4.0|This book does not include cd or cassetes but it is very organized and has as its name says an advanced vocabulary(a good option for the CAE Examination)<br /><br />I am 19, Peruvian student!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|My husband and I both loved this CD!  Every song on this CD is good.  The lyrics are good, but the music itself is even better.  It is really clever how there is a central theme that runs through all the songs (Jesus of Suburbia).  My 11 year old loves it also, but I would like to have the edited version without the bad words.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Firefly Series is the sad tale of a show not given the opportunity to fully expand to its potential reach of tv audiences. The show is truly a terrific sci-fi western, filled with wit, humor, and action. The characters immediately draw you into their world and are portrayed effortlessly by actors that seem to feel right at home within the first episode and continue to develop throughout the short lived series. Watch just the first two episodes and you will be hooked. Caution: once you have finished, you will be left with so many questions, some of which may never be answered. Luckily, the new movie Serenity (in theatres Sept 30) with the same cast and characters begins to explore some of the future possibilities of the Serenity crew and will hopefully open the doors for this space saga to continue, big or little screen.
0793573742|5.0|Beautiful pictures, good interviews, and excellent information for musicians and collectors. What makes this book really stand out is how everything was presented...very well-organized and nicely thought out. The book concentrates on the years 1958, 1959, and 1960 Les Pauls. If you're curious about Gibson Les Pauls you should buy this book.
0307276902|5.0|This is an excellent book. I really enjoyed the plot and how James Frey presented it.  This is a definite read for those who enjoy a night by the fire.  I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer that said this book is a book you must get also \\"Winning Points With The Woman In Your Life One Touchdown At A Time.\\"   <br /> <br />I heard on one of the boards that \\"Winning Points With The Woman In Your Life One Touchdown At A Time\\" was going out of print until the second edition next year and that the first edition that's available on Amazon is all that was left.
B0000024W3|3.0|Released in the summer of 1970, the two-LP offering \\"Self Portrait\\" might be called a mish-mash of live versions of re-worked Dylan originals, covers of some classics from other writers...or a Columbia catalogue-filler that lacks direction, inspiration, and cohesion. All of these my be accurate to some degree; part of what makes the album worth checking out, in my opinion, is the supporting cast of musicians, including, among many others, David Bromberg, Doug Kershaw, Ken Buttrey, Charlie Daniels, and Norman Blake. The Band is also present for at least some of the tunes. When you listen to Dylan's rendition of Paul Simon's \\"The Boxer\\", you may chuckle; it sounds as if it had been done in one quickie take, or two; Dylan harmonizes with himself. The story goes that Dyaln ran into Simon at Columbia's studio one day, and thus decided to record the tune. The two different version's of \\"Sadie\\" (\\"In Seacrh of Little...\\", and \\"Little\\") are fun, and funny, both featuring some pretty good guitar work by Bromberg. \\"Days of 49\\", written by B. and F. Bryant, is actually the perfect kind of song for Dylan to cover; a moody, minor-keyed ballad, with a great bass harmonica part. There are versions of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", \\"She Belongs to Me\\", and \\"Quinn the Eskimo\\" (The Mighty Quinn), the latter the first time it appeared performed by Dylan on a legitimate studio-issued record (not a bootleg). Not all of \\"Self Portrait\\" is very inspired, or very inspiring, and it may appeal mostly to hard-core fans, but it sounds as if Dylan had fun making it, and it is an interesting slice of the career of 'the original vagabond', as he passed from \\"John Wesley Harding\\" and \\"Nashville Skyline\\" towards \\"New Morning\\", and \\"Blood on the Tracks\\".
B0009S4IHY|3.0|The dvd I got doesn't work on my IBM Thinkpad or my girlfriend's Dell laptop.  Quite frustrating.  It plays just fine on my Panasonic dvd player at home though.  And of course I bought this dvd to watch for my long flight.  Go figure. <br /> <br />As for the movie itself, I found this movie quite dissapointing.  I loved Shaolin Soccer and was really looking forward to this movie, but the plot sucked!  Quite dissapointing.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|A wonderfull album with some of the strongest songs Young has written. \\"It's a Dream\\" is stunning an older man's reflections on a similar theme to \\"Don't be Denied\\" 30 years earlier.This is my album of the year, to date, in a strong year with very good albums from Ry Cooder, The Stones, McCartney & Richard Thompson.
B00005JMCW|4.0|Reading magazines and watching the news now, it's hard to believe that just two years ago, Lindsay Lohan was a beautiful, talented young actress who was on her way to becoming the next Ann-Margret, flaming red hair and all. Nowadays, she has become a talentless, wafer thin cleb, like all the other Hollywood stars.<br /><br />Oh well. But we could always look back on her early film work and enjoy the Lindsay that people loved. The red headed Irish girl with a million dollar smile, not the stick thin blonde that most people can't stomach. \\"Freaky Friday\\", the remake of the 1976 classic, gave the then 17 year old starlet her big break. It was her second film in seven years (following her debut in the \\"Parent Trap\\" remake), and might well be her best performance to date.<br /><br />Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis in top form) and her daughter Anna (Lohan) are two complete opposites. Tess is a successful pyschologist. Anna is a rebellious, punk rock living teen who can't stomach her mothe ror the fact that she is going to have a new dad, Harry (Mark Harmon). Anna's angst is caused by the passing of her father, so having another man take care of her is a harde pill to swallow. One night, the two go to a Chinese restaurant. While there, they have a huge fight, and a waitress gives them a fortune cookie. Then Anna locks herself in a bathroom. A strange, earthquake like occurence happens, and the next morning something happens.<br /><br />Anna and Tess wake up to realize they've switched bodies. Now, the two must go the days pretending their best to be each other -which, in Disney terms, means disaster. They learn the only way to get back their original forms is to learn to love, honor and respect each other. The fim wraps in a rather formulaic manner, but the film is enjoyable throughout.<br /><br />The two leading ladies are fantastic. Jamie Lee Curtis hasn't been this good in a while, while Lohan proved that at one point she was indeed a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The extras are decent, but it's the film you should watch. It's not the greatest film ever, but it's a wonderful way to pass the time.<br /> <br />The extras are decent, but it's the film you should watch.

0780628551|2.0|Johnny Depp (Secret Window, Ed Wood) goes up into space with his friend, actor Nick Cassevettes (son of Director John Cassevettes, starred in Face/Off) and both of them come back, in tact although Cassevettes soon after at a party dies and then his wife kills herself. Theron becomes more and more suspicious of her husband as she finds out evidence that Depp might not be her husband, but get this, an alien and that the twins she's carrying in her stomach are aliens as well. Then, she's all alone when her Sister and other's wind up missing. Bland boring thriller offers too many things that really dont add up to anything and the finale is hilariously dumb. Depp tries his best to rise above material that seemed to of been remade from other good movies and Theron cant show her talents as she lets all the stuff crumble on top of her....she's done way better people and so has Depp. Also starring Joe Morton (Speed, Terminator 2), Clea DuVall (Ghosts Of Mars, 13 Conversations About One Thing), Tom Noonan (Armageddon, Knockaround Guys), Donna Murphy and Gary Grubbs (Tv's Angel). A failed thriller.
B000001EC1|4.0|I'm not a fan of Bon Jovi and I never really hated the guy. I just so happened to notice that most of the recent reviews of this album had gone too far. Remenber that this Best of album was released by Polygram Records way back 1994 and not 2005.  <br /> <br />I for one bought a copy of this album simply because of the the two hit singles \\"Someday I'll Be Saturday Night\\" and \\"Always\\" to complete my Bon Jovi Collection. But it doesn't mean that its an awful album. <br /> <br />Why?  <br />1.)Because it's a compilation of the Most Popular Bon Jovi Singles to date.  <br /> <br />2.)There are two singles that were not included in previous or should i say old albums of Bon Jovi. <br /> <br />3.)People who are dissing this album are just afraid to accept the reality that their Rock gods have already fallen. And yet, Bon Jovi has a new album out this year (\\"Have A Nice Day\\") proving that they can still prove to the world that they still rock. <br /> <br />Ok, call it what you want. But don't deny that you listened to Bon Jovi before you figure out who your favorite bands are.  <br /> <br />For the people who wanted to buy the album: Trust your instincts. <br />Do not rely on reviews because sometimes even if the album is good they'll poorly rate it just because they hate the band.
B000A88EVE|5.0|Nicholas Roeg's alternately challenging and maddening sci-fi opus has been dissected enough on this site. What I am doing here is issuing a challenge: Why doesn't someone who has purchased and viewed the 2005 Criterion Edition grow some sack, step up to the plate and give us a persuasive reason to trade in our excellent,restored 2003 reissue Anchor Bay director's cut for, er, a twice as expensive \\"restored director's cut\\" a mere 2 years later? Don't get me wrong, I respect Criterion's credo of quality (I own many of thier titles) and normally anticipate thier updates on previous inferior transfers, but the Anchor Bay edition is so outstanding that this particular reissue seems pointless to me. Could the print be any more sparkling? Could the sound be THAT much improved? I can't be the only serious film buff/collector out there who is sick and tired of this money grubbing carrot-dangling game of \\"new and improved\\"! Someone from the consumer trenches needs to convince me!
0440237688|4.0|I greatly enjoyed reading Lois Lowry's book \\"The Giver\\". One of the reasons I liked this book is because it wasn't quite a totally \\"out there\\" book, but it did have a certain element of fiction in it that to some would seem fanciful and far-fetched, but I believe Lowry approached in a real way. Jonas is living in a perfect world where everyone is behaved and nothing ever goes wrong, until he is \\"selected\\" to become the next receiver of memory, and this will turn his save world into something dark and twisted. He finally gets to look around and see something real for the first time in his life. I believe that The Giver provided an accurate perception of Lowry's dream world, and also it had a certain element of suspense that is a rarity among books today. It's unique and makes you think, which is why I enjoyed reading the book so much.  <br />
B00005JO0J|5.0|While I didn't get a chance to see \\"Firefly\\" on T.V., I picked up the DVD set and instantly became a fan after watching the first episode.     When the announcement was made that a Serenity movie was in the works, I couldn't wait for its release. My patience paid off.     For someone like myself who is a Science Fiction fan, I was awestruck at how well made \\"Serenity\\" is!     What I also liked is that Joss Whedon wrote the script so that seeing the T.V. show is not mandatory in order to see the movie.     This flick certainly ranks up there with the Star Wars series in my book. Solid acting, good chemistry between the cast, great story line, excellent special effects and nail-biting action scenes.     In this film, we get to see a little bit more about how and why River is the way she is and find out the origin of the Reavers.     In a way, I was glad about what happened to the Operative but disappointed by what happened to 2 of the original Serenity crewmembers.     The movie is so good, you will come to care about the Serenity crew, laugh and possibly cry at the situations they are in too. You pull for the Serenity crew throughout the entire film.     These guys are the outcasts. The people others tend to ignore on the streets trying to make a living. This is their story showing the good and bad times I think we can all associate with.     I plan on seeing this movie again, will buy it when it comes out on DVD and hope sequels are in the works.     Well made movies like this deserve a second viewing.     I hope the release of \\"Serenity\\" means that Hollywood will be releasing films emphasizing real stories and characters rather than every tired, warmed over sequel, remake, and hack television drivel that was released during the summer. You will get your money's worth seeing this film!
B000002KHF|5.0|I bought this album as a farewell present to a friend and co-worker. It's a great album, but it was recorded in an era before digital recording. The recording was very quiet and hiss-filled. The only reason I could listen to it is because I own sound manipulation software that can remove the hiss and boost the amplitude of the music. <br /> <br />I wonder why the same process applied to Let It Be...Naked can't be applied to classic albums like these. After all, they could sell the CD all over again to people who love it!
0671027344|3.0|i read this book during a bout of insomnia one night. i found it interesting enough to read and keep me occupied, but i would say there is nothing too special about it. i really liked certain elements of it, it was an enjoyable read, but overall nothing really stuck with me that i didn't feel was just the standard coming of age/ self discovery story. i would definately point out the published by mtv thing. this is the second mtv book i've accidentaly purchased (if i see that they are mtv i won't buy them), and they really are all the same, catcher in the rye, inspired stories.
B000002GB6|2.0|The only problem I've ever had with Chuck Mangione is that he plays sharp all the time. Other than that- I love his stuff. I also agree that the title track is fab, but especially the guitar solo is stellar. He, unfortunately, gets cut off right as he's starting to cook. Quite frustrating!
B000063UR1|4.0|The premise is a bit preposterous, but once you get past that, this movie is a great watch.  Bruce Dern is the perfect choice as the \\"throwback to the 70's kind of guy\\", who finally breaks when he finds that his beloved forests are to be, not just abandoned, but destroyed.  The \\"Drones\\" are, by far, better than R2D2 or C3PO. (George Lucas should have used this technique). With todays computer generated graphics, this could be a terrific remake.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars ?, well this movie was filmed in the early 70's, so they got Joan Baez to do the singing.
B000AL730O|5.0|Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is simply stunning.  I'm not a big fan of Paul McCartney's solo works; I've been a Beatles fan since 1964, and in my view, none of the Fabs' solo product comes close to reaching the same level of greatness.  But in this CD, McCartney far exceeds my expectations, and I am delighted.    This is not a CD for those who want silly love songs, facile hooks, or tailored-for-radio pop hits.  This is music by a man who has been through life's joys and travails, and for the first time in recent memory, McCartney goes beneath the surface of his feelings and pulls up some truly moving lyrics to go with his beautifully crafted melodies.  I don't agree with those who have written that there are no melodies on this album.  They resonate and stay in your head long after you've shut off the CD player.    \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is my favorite track.  It may be the least accessible, but Paul displays a rare candor and forthrightness in addressing someone who has rejected his friendship.  Direct and incisive, it serves a jolt of reality that is very different from the often frothy fare McCartney has offered in the past.      Other standout tracks include:  \\"Jenny Wren\\"--it's easy to dismiss this tune as \\"daughter of 'Blackbird,'\\" as it has an acoustic guitar accompaniment and the avian allusions.  But the melody is gorgeous, the guitar is perfect, and the duduk is hypnotic.  The lyrics are more poignant and world-weary than \\"Blackbird.\\"  This is a superior composition.    \\"At the Mercy\\"--another strong melody, exquisitely matched with thoughtful, introspective lyrics.      \\"Promise to You Girl\\"--a spirited pastiche of harmonies, tempo changes, and aggressive piano-backed pop.  A good choice for a single.    Overall, McCartney's singing is superb.  There is an intimacy and raw quality that is compelling.  I love listening to him on this CD.  Oh, and he plays nearly every instrument.  Thanks, Paul, for this wonderful collection of music and words.  Youstill rock, brother!
B000B8IA2G|2.0|Stargate Atlantis is quite possibly the worst spin off I have had the displeasure of watching. I'm giving it 2 stars only for the music and special effects.  It is a poor attempt at taking a wonderful story and turning it into a complete failure. Dr. Rodney McKay comes off as the same annoying; know it all, blowhard that he played on a couple episodes of the original SG-1. He is a pale attempt at giving Atlantis it's own version of Samantha Carter.  Dr. Elizabeth Weir is a failure as a leader with a sweet smile and clueless actions on how to deal with a military situation. Major John Sheppard seems totally out of place in this show. The wild haired Major comes off more as someone who wants to look good rather than someone who has any idea about the military. Rounding out the foursome is Lt. Aiden Ford. This character seems more like a high school freshman trying to fit it than an SG member. I will give credit in regards to the basic plot and the special effects. You can see the same desire put in each episode as have been with SG-1, but it lacks the solid acting and creative characters that SG-1 fans have come to enjoy. I was also pleased with the creation of a new enemy. The wraiths are a welcome change from the Goa'uld and I feel there is great potential with them. Overall this show has come to be a great disappointment to me. It has the look and feel of SG-1, but none of the depth from a character perspective. Watch at your own risk.
B000002KIE|5.0|This album is great. Thats where it ends. Please stop the Sid Vicious Bashing. The man was a world famous rock star. What will you do with your lives.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Im not really surprise why there are so many negative reviews on this one, there are two types of negative reviewers here, the first one is the one who's new or never heard of nighwish, they hate the record bec. they are alienated to tarja's voice, bec. they're used to listen to evanesence, tarja's voice aint really for pop music lovers, her voice is operatic, thats why she's the first female vocalist with a classical music background to sing in a metal band, the second negative reviewers are the hardcore nightwish fans, the reason why they are disappointed in this one is that they keep on comparing this to their previous records, plus this one is less speed,less guitar solo, and there are tracks here that does not have a guitar solo which frustrates the metalheads coz guitar solos are the trademark of a metal band. Why I love this record? simple reason I dont like repition, and nightwish has done this at the right time, the sound is excellent, tarja's voice as always outstanding, plus they add prgression to this record, yes its progressive, its heavy and very melodic, very symphonic, listening to the record is like watching fantasy movies, its very thematic. Harcore fans are disappointed with Emmpu, bec. there's less guitar shredding here, but Emmpu did the right thing, coz there are tracks here that doesn't really need a guitar solo, coz if you add guitar solo to those tracks, it would difinitely sound odd, I mean come on guys Emmpu can really play and if your looking for nightwish's speed symphonic metal style then you're in deep trouble with this one, instead try \\"wishmaster\\" or \\"oceanborn\\" those records are thrashy and your can hear the best of Emmpu's shredding.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Please would You guys stop talking about the loss of Nick like he makes or breaks this band. Hes not Paul. His main contributions to the band was some punk songs and some kick a** bass riffs. Now im not trying to say he wasnt important or anything but Josh is the man in this band, and the band was always meant to have a revolving door of musicians, much like how the Foo fighters used to be. I think the main problem i have is with the fans that discovered the band after songs for the deaf came out. I mean i loved songs but it was NOT there masterpeice it was there hard rock stoner groove album that the band has probably been itching to do. R was the most creative and inovative album to ever come out in a very long time. What this Lullabies does is combine Kyuss, all 3 qotsa albums and a bit of eagles of death metal all in one cd, all of them in most songs as well. QOTSA were never a heavy metal band they were everywhere and nowhere all at once, they rock yet they are mellodic in the same breath of air. Just because most of the fans that jumped on the ball late wanted a heavy cd again dosnt mean that they should do it. I would be down right mad if they had done a repeat. Instead they made the most Stoner/Trippy and accesiable album to date in my opinion. Ok stand out track for me is burning witch and im pretty sure its about the Salem witch trials since most if not all songs on the cd is a lullaby or a fairy tale or something even though i cant quite figure out how medication fits into that. If i was to be a critic for all of there cd's this would be the star ratings.Self Title ***, R ***** I would say this one should just be an all time classic, Songs ****, And lullabies *****. ok i hope this review isnt to rambling, my bad
B00005JNJV|5.0|To many, I may come across as blasphemous to say that Tim Burton's Batman sucked eggs. As a 'Joker Movie' it was allright, but it captured nothing of what Batman was about. Batman is not an 'Everyman' and the 4 preceeding movies had him as some hapless shlub in a rubber suit totally dependent upon gadgets. How good could the 'Batarang' be if a freakin POODLE can catch it in his mouth and run off with it? What kind of Batplane could be knocked out of the sky with one shot?!?Sure, the movie was dark, but when can you find a Tim Burton movie that didn't have his nihilistic slant to it? Michael Keaton could've made a better Joker, but the guy didn't do squat for/as Batman, except show the world how NOT to be Batman. <br />   Christian Bale portrayed the many facets as well as the driving fear and anger which lingered and grew from childhood.Like the movie \\"Equilibrium' he showed a cool, stoic side, obsessed with his mission. He also gave you the impression that there was only ONE Batman, and that he's more than a Rubber suit. I BELIEVED that this guy was going to SAVE Gotham, and that he was the ONLY thing standing in the way of total chaos! His first foray into the streets of Gotham was the classic 'Night of the Batman' much like 'the night of Superman' where in the movie, he saves Lois , the President, foils 2 criminal acts and gets a cat out of a tree. <br />Bale gave the criminals reason to fear him, especially by his 'swooping from the shadows' attacks. Everything that was essentially Batman had it's reason for being, right down to the scallops on his gloves. Like a True Ninja, he worked everything into his repetoir. When the bums on the rooftop shot and knocked Keaton on his butt, I rolled my eyes in disgust. After he got back up,MY first response would be to aim at the face, next time. And that wasn't the ONLY time he fell onto his backside. Tim Burton's Batman was a clumsy pretender in a town of incompetents. But THAT is a rant for another time... <br />   Believe me, If you're a Tim Burton fan, you may like the originals, but if you're a BATMAN fan, Batman Begins is the ONLY batfilm you NEED TO SEE and OWN!!!!!
B00005JN5X|2.0|I think people are giving `The Brothers Grimm' a little too much credit than it deserves. <br /> <br />Working with a premise rife with possibilities, Terry Gilliam's product is, unfortunately, an unremarkable film that verges on lacklustre, riding almost entirely on a screenplay that, while imaginative, seems to settle for the audience grinning with familiarity at the fairytales that it subversively pays homage to. The re-imagination of a number of the stories is contrived, the most tedious and laughable of the lot being the film's nods to the gingerbread man and the Big Bad Wolf from `Little Red Riding Hood'. The film shies away from its most thoughtful scene, when Jacob is forced to consider which reality he would choose - the one he physically experiences, or the one in an illusory magic mirror - and the consequences of that choice. Where Gilliam could have examined how the realm of make-believe can be dangerously beguiling, he stops at a resolution that's unsatisfying for being all too easy. <br /> <br />Gilliam's directing work is surprisingly muddled, resulting in patchy editing and inconsistent performances from his actors. He fails monumentally at emotional modulation - a fraternal relationship that's hardly engaging, a throwaway love triangle - and should have probably focussed on delivering on entertainment, in which case any neglect he would have had for his characters, I believe, would have been quite forgivable, if considered at all.  <br /> <br />In addition, while visual effects don't have to be thoroughly convincing to be fun, the images in this movie appear so campy and artificial, you wonder if any deliberation really went into the realisation of Gilliam's flights of fancy. The production design is also disappointing, considering the movie's settings and the avenues they present for conceiving creative locales and sets. Nothing here compares to the sumptuousness of other films that take full advantage of the vibe afforded by their settings, for instance Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow'. <br /> <br />What salvage the movie are Heath Ledger's mildly idiosyncratic performance of a man who seems to be slowly withering inwards till the Grimm pair finds its way to Marbaden, Monica Belluci's delicious evil queen - pretty much a role she sleepwalks through, but fills the shoes of delectably nonetheless - and the occasionally bewitching charm of sheer imagination. <br /> <br />I would have given it 2 stars.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|First off, I want to point out the positives of this release, because it does have a few.  Not concerning the songs themselves, but that casing is amazing.  It comes in an extremely well done hardback book, with the CD being on the back of the cover when you open it, and the DVD being on the inside of the back....all with great photos and liner notes from the band being on the pages between.  I also thorougly LOVE the fact that they finally brought back the fuzzy dandelion disc art that we all know from the Adrenaline and Around The Fur discs.  I wish they would have stuck with this on the White Pony and Self Titled discs.  But anyways, as far as positive ends from the music...The Chauffeur.  This has always been one of my favorite deftones tracks.  Its also very nice to have official releases of some of the tracks, considering the quality one gets from finding tracks online isnt always that great.  Its also extremely sweet to have every single deftones video on one dvd, that deffinetly satisfies the anal b*#^@rd in me. <br /> <br />But, the biggest nit pick I have with this is the music itself.  Not that I wish any of these songs werent present, I just want more.  It also saddens me that they left out some of their best B-sides.  This disc is not so much a rarities and b-sides as it is a \\"Covers and Remixes\\" album.  I have been looking forward to a deftones b-sides for years.  In fact, I made one myself awhile ago.  But I was looking forward to the official release, with consistent mixing and production...and because some of my favorite tracks are missing its a dissapointment.  The most noteable tracks absent are \\"Teething\\" (one of the best deftones tracks ever, better than most of their album tracks) and (like everyone else has already said) \\"To Have And To Hold.\\"  These are not only good for b-sides, but are STELLAR deftones gems that deserve an official release from the band themselves, not to be left for some crappy movie soundtrack or covers album.  These arefan and personal favorites that really stand out in the deftones catalogue and their absence truly hinders this release.  I think any fan would be with me 100% on this. <br /> <br />Here is a list of tracks that should have seen this release (not only are they better than most of the tracks that made the cd, but some are heavier more \\"deftones\\" tracks that would have put more excitement and devirsity into the disc): <br /> <br />- Teething (one of best deftones songs ever) <br />- To Have And To Hold (another best ever) <br />- Can't Even Breathe (good track, please for the love of god save it from the \\"escape from l.a. soundtrack\\") <br />- Answers <br />- Damone (would be nice to have this song more accessable than after 30 minutes of fastforwarding after \\"Around The Fur\\") <br />- Say It Ain't So  <br />- The Boys Republic (not everyone has the special white pony, so this also would have been choice for this release) <br /> <br />I was actually expecting all of the above tracks to make it onto this release, so it's deffinetly a let down.  It is still worth buyin if you are a huge fan.  Let's just hope for another, and better, B-sides disc in the future.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Copy protection?  (Yawn.)  Who cares what all you spoiled, snot-nosed, self indulgent little brats think about that?  Grow up.  Stick the CD in a CD player and comment on what you hear please.  Don't write a review unless you have heard THE SONGS, you immature morons.  I am opposed to copy protection too, but I don't need to read about it 350 times here.  Plus, any one with an ounce of computer literacy could get around it anyway.  My rating above is based on the contents of the album only.  (End of rant.) <br /> <br />I love each and every Foo Fighters album, which was a surprise to me initially since I was never a fan of Nirvana.  But the truth is, they continue to shine and present something new with each release.  This double CD set, clocking in at just over 83 minutes total, is something completely new to me. <br /> <br />The first disk, the heavy one, is just vintage Foo.  Get blasted into hard rock glory as the opening title track kicks in.  The single \\"Best of You\\" has vintage David Grohl vocals.  \\"Resolve\\" is somewhat of a mid-tempo track with amazingly melodic vocals.  Most of the songs on this 10-track, 40-minute set are short, but the last track \\"End Over End\\" clocks in at nearly 6 minutes with that epic Foo \\"ending album buildup\\" (think \\"Come Back\\" on the previous masterpiece \\"One By One\\"). <br /> <br />I love slower Foo tracks too, but I wasn't sure about a disk full of them.  Well, they have won me over with this effort too.  \\"Still\\" is just a mystical, haunting masterpiece to lead things off (what a change in pace from \\"End Over End\\" if you listen to the two disks back to back).  \\"Miracle\\" is a beautiful melodic masterpiece; this song would be a quality pop hit (something there clearly aren't enough of these days).  \\"Virginia Moon\\" with Norah Jones doesn't even sound like the Foo Fighters, but it fits on this disk and is fascinating to me on this album.  (Again a comparison:  think of this song and then \\"In Your Honor\\" and be blown away that this isthe same band.)  To those who say the slow disk is boring:  give it a few listens, including without the distractions we often face in our daily lives.  I think there's a good chance it may grow on you.  I think it is brilliant. <br /> <br />This whole album and the concept behind it is in fact brilliant.  I have read other reviews indicating this could be the last Foo album.  I was not aware of that, and I sure hope it is not true.  From the time I became a fan of these guys, they have never disappointed with any new release.  This one may be the biggest surprise of all.  Destined to be a classic.
B0007P3582|3.0|the reviewer below obviously doesnt like hip hop. He hates the fact that a guy from the hood is successful. He hates rap in general. <br />This album is a good album. A bit long, but 50 has the cream of the crop in his side with production. In my hood is a good start, and Needlz kills it with piggy bank.If u like hissingles u'd like his album, 50 is good at making catchy hooks and choruses that people can sing along too. And that takes talent. This album is not all abot guns, hoes etc, the last reviewer obviously hasnt even listened to this. Ofcourse it has thatelement , but that was part of his past so hes gonna talk about it right? <br /> <br />All in all a solid album.
B000286S8S|4.0|Just to be clear, I love both the Roth and Hagar eras of Van Halen.  They both have definite merits.  If I had to break the \\"tie\\" in my mind concerning my feelings about the two eras, I might actually pick Sammy only because his solo stuff is so far superior not to mention, well, that Dave is a complete moron.  Still, like many others, I am annoyed with how this collection was presented. <br /> <br />First off, going back and forth from Dave to Sammy tracks is a bit tedious.  I'm not saying the tracks had to be chronological, but this continual back and forth was too much.  A few of one followed by a few of the other might have been better. <br /> <br />Second, I have to sound off like many others have about the two flawed tracks--the cutout of \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" plus including the instrumental \\"Strung Out\\" at the beginning of \\"It's Not Enough\\".  Those are unacceptable errors that never should have been missed. <br /> <br />Third, I HATE having those live tracks--exactly the same as from their live album \\"Right Here, Right Now\\"--stuck at the end of disk 2, and having them all be Hagar singing Roth tunes makes it even worse.  Again, I'd choose Hagar if I had to make a choice, but the obvious petty thinking behind this ploy is stupid--especially knowing how many \\"Roth era only\\" fans are out there.  They should have replaced those tracks with other deep album classic cuts and, yes, at least one track from VHIII (ignoring that in the discography was another stupid, petty ploy).  Or another option would to be to go ahead and include a few live tracks--but different recordings that we have not already heard before. <br /> <br />Okay, I've complained an awful lot for a 4-star review, so what do I like here?  Well, duh--of course the songs themselves rock, and it is great to have such an overall complete collection in one place.  (Best of Volume I was way too incomplete.)  I don't need to rave in detail about the classic tracks; any Van Halen fan knows them inside andout and knows why they like the tracks.  I still love most of those tracks to this day.  Unlike plenty of others, I also like all three of the new tracks.  I have no problem with bands including new stuff on a greatest hits compilation as long as the material doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.  In this case, while a couple of the new tracks have that slightly modern sound, they are solid and to me not at all out of place. <br /> <br />So there you have it.  It's hard to give a \\"best of\\" collection from one of my favorite bands of all time that actually includes most of the key tracks under 5 stars, but the points above clearly explain why.  I still love this band, and if this indeed was their final chapter, I can more than live with that.  Their legacy in rock and roll is permanently established whether or not they ever are heard from again.  The petty items from their history, both old and recent, won't change my feeling about the music itself.
0812550706|4.0|Before I read \\"Ender's Game\\" I wasn't really in to books, but Card kept me intent to read page after page. It is no doubt one of the most well written books i have ever read. I've read it several times since my first. If you like science fiction books this is definately something you should take a look at, or if u just like a very \\"mind blowing\\" story that's filled with twists and suprises that will keep you breathless until the end.
0140177396|5.0|I've noticed in different high schools I have worked at that this book is stil universely read with good reason.  I recently went through a Steinback phase after driving by the Steinback museum near Salinas on the 101 (California). <br /> <br />This book does so MANY things well it's really a template for how to write a complete novel.  At the simplest level, the plot is quick and fast paced and used effectively to stregnthen the other elements of the book.  The prose is perfect as the tone is appropriate throughout.  There is dread in the air when we are unsure of Lennie's actions or future and a calm in the scenes where we see friednly interaction between the two main characters.  The book is touching and the characterization makes these people real and emotional.  Finally the themes of percieved right and wrong, being your own person, and idividual freedom are all touched upon expertly. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  There is a reason why this has been made into a play, a movie, and is mandatory reading in high school.  If you are looking to read a \\"classic\\" and want some lighter reading that won't consume too much time then this is for you.
0740748475|5.0|Anyone who read comics strips in the 80's and 90's has one strip that always brings a smile to their face - Calvin and Hobbes.  Now, the entire too short run of this classic is collected in one classy set.<br /><br />For those not familiar, Calvin is a six year old boy growing up in a house with his parents.  His best friend is his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, who happens to be real, but only to Calvin.  Together, the two get into all kinds of scraps, mainly because Calvin is the poster child for obnoxious kids.  The fact that his parents haven't strangled him is a major miracle.<br /><br />For the reader, this is a wonderful treat, because it means we get to watch Calvin in one adventure after another refusing to learn anything.  And his imagination makes those adventures far out.  He might be Spaceman Spiff, battling the evil Zorg who want to torture him by sending him to school.  He might create a duplicator and create duplicates of himself to ease his homework load.  He might don his Stupendous Man costume to fight his nemesis Babysitter Fiend.  Or he might use his time machine to travel forward in time to get his completed homework from his future self.  And don't forget a nice round of Calvinball.  Or a meeting of the top secret club GROSS (Get Rid Of Slimy girlS).<br /><br />This strip was full of creativity and fun.  Part of its charm was its ability to give a nostalgic look back at childhood through realist's glasses.<br /><br />As the series progressed, its creator began to include some social satire in his strips.  This became seriously hysterical.  I just loved Calvin's gum magazine \\"Chewing.\\"<br /><br />This set is designed for collectors.  It includes everything done for the strip over the years in three hardbound books collected in a slip case.  This includes an all new introduction as well as covers and extra illustrations done for the collections over the years.  The biggest draw back is the size.  These are heavy books, and it's really hard to curl up with them and read for a few hours.<br /><br />This set is for the serious Calvin and Hobbes fan.  If you aren't already in love with these characters, find a collection today so you can meet them.  Either way, you'll want the paperback collections for your everyday Calvin and Hobbes reading.<br /><br />And maybe, someday, we can convince Bill Watterson to come out of retirement and give us further adventures of this wonderful duo.curl up with them and read for a few hours. <br /> <br />This set is for the serious Calvin and Hobbes fan.

B00006JIA4|5.0|I love Queen. In my opinion, they are the greatest rock and roll band ever (I know I'm going to catch a lot of heat for that statement, but I stand my opinion). As with all great bands, Quen has a barrage of geatest hits collections available for caual fans and diehards alike. Some time ago, the three cd mini boxed set \\"Queen - The Platinum Collection\\" came out. How does it hold up? Read on.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-If you're a casual fan, this boxed set will suit you well.Disc one has all the classic Queen hits, including \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"You're My Best Friend\\", \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\".<br /><br />-There are a lot of underrated masterpieces included, especially on disc two, such as \\"I Want It All\\", \\"The Miracle\\", \\"The Show Must Go On\\" and \\"The Invisible Man\\".<br /><br />-The songs sound great.<br /><br />The liner notes for this collection are fantastic.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />-Disc three is unneeded. It contains ome truly great songs that deserve to be here (for exampl,e the tearjerking \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\", one of my all time favorite Queen songs ever. But the majority of the songs are just rare filler.<br /><br />-\\"One Visoin\\" is, in my opinion, filler that should not be on here.<br /><br />-Discs 1 & 2 are a mere repackaging of \\"Greatest Hits Vols. 1 & 2\\". If they wanted to make a third disc, here's what the song selection should have been:<br /><br />*Tie Your Mother Down<br /><br />*Stone Cold Crazy<br /><br />*Keep Yourself Alive<br /><br />*Love Of My Life (why was this never on a Queen collection)?<br /><br />*All God's People<br /><br />*One Year Of Love<br /><br />*Death On Two Legs<br /><br />*Las Palabras De Amor<br /><br />*Calling All Girls<br /><br />*Body Language<br /><br />*The Great Pretender<br /><br />*It's Late<br /><br />*Was It All Worth It<br /><br />*Scandal<br /><br />*Is This The World We Created<br /><br />*Thank God It's Christmas<br /><br />*These Are The Days Of Our Lives<br /><br />So, while I guess this is a decent boxed set, I think you're better off buying either \\"Greatest Hits Vols. 1 & 2\\" or buying the single disc collections \\"Classic Queen\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\" together.test Hits Vols. 1 & 2\\" or buying the single disc collections \\"Classic Queen\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\" together.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Demon Days will be a sure candidate to be on many people's Top 10 lists for 2005.  The kind of CD that's both challening and fun at the same time.  Maybe the initial novelty of the Gorillaz idea has worn off, but I agree with the Amazon review that this is an upgrade over the self-titled debut.  While there were many great songs on the debut, at 71 minutes Gorillaz felt a little too long and not consistently able to match the greatness of \\"Clint Eastwood\\" or \\"19-2000\\".  The addition of Danger Mouse as producer has brought Demon Days to a new level.  The enitre CD is full of tightly focused, catchy as hell yet still unique-sounding songs.  It has the killer single (Feel Good, Inc. is definitely the equal to Clint Eastwood) and all the other songs have all the right pieces in all the right places.  The blend of Damon in all his Britishness with kooky dance/sci-fi vibes and well-placed and delivered raps and background vocals make every song a worthwile listen.  Damon has traveled this blend of dance and rock since the Blur 13 CD, and while William Orbit and Fatboy Slim got it mostly right, Danger Mouse helps Damon to finally put it all together.  All in all, a brilliant CD that you will want to listen to time and time again.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Franz Ferdinand's follow up to their sparkling self-titled debut, You Could Have It So Much Better, is another hook filled record.  The one noticeable difference is a fuller production sound.  The songs don't have that clipped feel of the original and they have a better sonic texture.  The first single \\"Do You Want To\\" has a tremendous riff and a killer vocals.  \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" is a great ballad that wouldn't sound out of place on a Beatles record.  \\"I'm Your Villain\\" has a Bowie/Eno in Berlin vibe and \\"This Boy\\" is pure punk-pop.  While the album is not as consistent from top-to-bottom like their debut, there's no sophomore slump here.  The band knows hooks and they've shown on their first two albums, they aren't afraid to use them.
B000056BAF|4.0|Being a major Blur fan, I went nuts the first time I heard Clint Eastwood.  What an awesome song - definitely one of the best songs of the 2000's.  The idea of a band with all-cartoon characters combined with funky vibes and an old-school party atmosphere was such a cool, novel idea - how could it not succeed?  Many of the songs just invigorate you - challenging but catchy as hell.  The type of songs that can't be denied no matter how \\"outside the box that is pop radio\\" these songs can be.  Gorillaz isn't perfect - I think at 71 minutes it's a bit too long and takes a while to get going (which in my opinion is a concern that Danger Mouse fixes for the even-better Demon Days).  Dan the Automator should've probably cut a few songs out.  But once it gets going, you see why it went platinum and was considered one of the best of 2001.  Worth getting just for Clint Eastwood but I also really love the work with Ibraham Ferrer on Latin Simone.  All in all, a really cool CD and a really great direction for Damon Albarn to go with his music - even if indirectly caused Graham Coxon to leave Blur.  Check it out.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am very satisfied with my purchase. The dvd's work perfectly and have no problems. The only bad thing I can coment on is that one of the dvd cases is damaged, but that is not that big of and issue. The story behind Firefly is amazing and worthy of the movie that has come out in theaters. I wish Fox had continued with the serires. It;s something new and creative.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|As the book Persuasion differs from the book P&P so do the two films and this is no criticism: simply stating a fact. They differ because they concentrate on different characters. As Elizabeth is lively and energetic so is Anne gentle and charming. One is not better than the other: only different.<br /><br />Although I don't think Persuasion is as charismatic as P&P, it is still very well done. Amanda Root represents Anne's qualities very charmingly and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is very masculine, but gentle at the same time.<br /><br />Concerning the other characters I imagined Elizabeth would be more attractive (externally!) as it is so often emphasized in the book and Mr Elliot would be more mature: the actor seemed to me a bit young to add real weight and interest to this character.<br /><br />Costumes, music, landcapes were also very well suited to the atmosphere of this film of great quality.<br /><br />I recommend it to JA and costume drama fans.
0740748475|5.0|I just got this collection, and I love it. I love the way Watterson writes, and of course, there is the comic itself, which I have always loved. There is something so wonderful about this comic that has stayed with us, even 6 years after the last strip was printed, which I think is an accomplishment within itself; there are very few comic strips that have been able to hold our attention even after the last strip has been printed, and all this without the benefit of movies, or tv shows, or mass marketing of products related. It goes to show the brilliance of the writing of the strip itself. I find there are moments of sheer comic laugh out loud moments, and there are the moments that are poingnant. This collection is an excellent dedication to the series, and to the fans, whom I hope, like me, will cherish this for many more years.
0800141660|5.0|I remember first seeing the film in the cinema and also very well remember the total enchantment I felt. The production has captivated me right from the start and still does whenever I watch it over and over again.<br /><br />The chemistry between the Dashwood sisters played by Emma Thompson (sensible, rational and seemingly restraint Elinor) and Kate Winslet (passionate, oversensitive and open Marianne)works wonderfully. The family picture completed with Gemma Jones as Mrs Dashwood and Emily F. as Margaret is lovely and lively. There are some fresh family scenes where Margaret gets more attention (she is not wholly portraited in the book as a rather insignificant character)giving light touches to the film preventing it to become too gloomy at certain points.<br /><br />Emma Thompson created an absolutely wonderful screenplay. Sad and funny events alternate each other increasing and relaxing tension making the film intriguing and exciting from first minute to the last.<br /><br />A pity that two scenes were deleted where Elinor's character - a dialogue between her and her mother - gets highlighted even further and a pity for the deleted kiss with Hugh Grant. Fortunately they can be enjoyed as extras on the DVD.<br /><br />As to male performance, I found Alan Rickman's colonel Brandon - the character is actually a bit flat in the book, not too much excitement there - totally stunning. He gave dimension to the character: he was humane, gentle and good, but very manly without a trace of boredom in him. You could feel his passion for Marianne and the past sadness still lingering over him. The scene where he gets introduced in the film (his intently watching Marianne as if spellbound) is one of the most amazing peaks of the film.<br /><br />Hugh Grant was a shy, but likeable Edward Ferrars, his caring, brotherly relationship with Margaret made him more endearing. Greg Wise played a truly dashing Willoughby.<br /><br />The Devon scenery - wonderful, wonderful Britain! - was photgraphed at its most advantageous, the costumes were brilliant and the sonnets gave true dramatization to plot and characters.<br /><br />Do not hesitate, buy it now!!l Britain! - was photgraphed at its most advantageous, the costumes were brilliant and the sonnets gave true dramatization to plot and characters. <br /> <br />Do not hesitate, buy it now!!  <br /> <br />
B00005RYL2|5.0|I was first told of this movie over 15 years ago. I was reluctant to watch because of the sword fighting (Not a big interest of mine) After watching it, it has become one of my favorites over the years and I make it a point to watch once or twice a year...it's that good! A superb performance by Clancy Brown brings an excitement to this picture. Of course, having Sean Connery in your film NEVER hurts! It has been fun to watch actors and actresses from this movie as they have progressed in their careers. I believe that you have to open your mind to this kind of film and take the time to finish it. It is full of surprises and ranchy humor. Watch for a scene when the Kargin and his hostage are driving through the streets of New York! Absolutely hillarious as the old famous song \\"New York\\" is played and sang by Queen! A true thumbs up for this motion picture! Creative and unique for its time!
B000003TAR|5.0|I have every Nirvana album and I can confidently say that this is the best. I feel Nirvana finally found its own unique sound on this album more so than the others (Bleach sounds like zeppelin+metal, nevermind sounds like vaselines+pixies). The drums are incredible. The intense guitars are amazing. Kurt's scream is much more emotional in comparison to the other albums. I honestly don't think there's a bad track on here. It's as good (better in my opinion) than the much more famous Nevermind but never got the respect it deserved. I've heard that Kurt insisted on a harsher production to scare off the fair-weather fans and redeem his rock cred so it's no wonder it didn't sell as well as the more tame Nevermind. Despite sales, this album is creatively superior to Nevermind as a whole.
0385474547|1.0|I read this book once in high school and then again for a college class in freshman year. I graduated college 2 years ago, but this book is so awful that I felt obligated to come back and review it.  <br /> <br />First I will admit that there are positive points to the book- it has a very coherent structure and manages to go into a lot of detail about african culture without losing the plot on unrelated tangents.  <br /> <br />But there is something so overwhelmingly negative about this book that none of the well done novelistic elements can overcome. Anyone with sense would be rooting for the imperialists by the end of this book. This is what everyone in my high school class did and most of the kids in my college class as well. Okonkwo and his tribe leaders basically believe in santimoniously violating everyone's human rights aside from powerful landowning males. The women are beaten, the children have few choices in how to live their lives, there is a caste of outcasts that is not allowed to better themselves and unwanted children are left to starve to death when there is absolutely nothing defective about them. This story chronicles how a) Okonkwo's gentle and music loving father was considered a failure in the culture while Okonkwo who is brutal and despotic is largely a success. b) Okonkwo's son's conversion to christianity is shown to be a sincere leaning that he develops after years of feeling guilty about what *he himself* sees as tribal barbarism- abandoning of twins etc. It was not something forced on him, it was something that he freely chose out of open minded ethical thought. When the western christians come, the outcasts are allowed to behave as normal respected people, superstitions about evil spirits in the forests are proven to be false and technology such as bicycles are introduced to the people.  <br /> <br />Sorry folks- the imperialists are the good guys in this book. Things fall apart in Okonkwo's culture, but good riddance to such barbarism anyways! All this book shows is a detailed explanation of how imperialists brought progress and humanity to Nigerian savages. <br /> <br />The thing is, it is possible to paint a culture with all its flaws and bigotries and still build sympathy for it. Pearl S Buck really makes one feel for the main character's attachment to his land and his ambitions in the good earth even though he also is a prideful sexist classist man. Achebe does not in any way build sympathy for the main character or his culture and the majority of readers in HS or college will feel that way as well.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Those that have negative things to say about this album, for shame!   It almost made me not want to hear the album, and that would've been a huge mistake.  This album is incredible and it makes you feel good.  Daft Punk have always been repetitive, and it works amazingly well for them.  Repetition has never been so good! The songs are very catchy and will stick in your head.  For all fans of techno/house music, this is a must!
0060512806|5.0|While it can be a bit daunting at more than 1100 pages, Neal Stephenson's CRYPTONOMICON is one thrill ride of a read.  Telling stories than span from World War II to the present, Stephenson's paranoid Pynchonesque novel is one of the best books I have read in quite a while.
B000002J2B|5.0|In the 80's I was a kid, exposed to Genesis via Invisible Touch, exploring his way through the vastness of unlimited artists and musical offerings.  My older brother had a copy of Wind and Wuthering on eight track, leftover from the 70s (I'm sure;)), and I found the album richly gratifying.  Lyrically and musically beautiful, for instance \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\"; this 1976 epic album is far more complex than their commerical 80's pop.  W&W has some outstanding songs: Eleventh Earl Of Mar, One for the Vine, Blood on the Rooftops and Afterglow are my favorites.  \\"Your Own Special Way\\" is a pretty song but lacking any convincing vocal power.  I sold a copy of this CD years ago because I overplayed it and tired of it.  But I was compelled to purchase it again.  You definitely should.  If you are a new genesis fan - bear in mind that their sound changed, drastically, from the 70s to the 80s and 90s.  This is not pop music; this is progressive Rock.  If you enjoy \\"Invisible Touch\\", for instance, then this album's sound will jolt you...it may be an acquired taste.  But I encourage new Genesis fans to lend your ears and mind to their amazing 70's works; Give it a try - you will be delighted.
B000002P7R|5.0|Jimi Hendrix is arguably the all time Master of the Guitar.  He has yet to be outdone in spite of the decades since his passing.  While I enjoy the sort of Hendrix tunes played frequently on the radio, many songs just aren't heard unless one owns the album.  South Saturn Delta is one of my personal favorites.  If you enjoy First Rays of the New Rising Sun, or Axis: Bold as Love, any Hendrix fan would appreciate this collection as much if not more.  Play on Jimi.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|HEY YA, HEY YA, HEY YA! STEP RIGHT UP SUCKAS AND BUY YA FAVORITE SHOW ALL OVER AGAIN! ANYTHING NEW? HARDLY. SAME STUFF - BUT DIFFERENT - AND PRETTY! - PACKAGING! Looks like this is getting to be a trend. You can damn well expect the same thing for The Sopranos and any other favorite television program you've bought in good faith when it came out as an individual season. There's no reason to pick this up unless you're a masochist. I WOULD buy it if commentaries were available for every episode, but you know that's not going to happen.
B00005JO0J|5.0|The best part of Serenity, for me, was some closure to the first season of Firefly, which, after I marathoned in 1 day, left me aching for more.  I've watched Serenity twice this weekend, and will no doubt see it again this week.<br /><br />However, new doors have opened, and the pathway is paved for a new....SOMETHING.  Ideally, a second season (where Wheadon will be able to flesh-out the stories as he does so well) but I will happily take a second movie.  At this point, I have no expectations from entertainment executives.<br /><br />ps - Nathan Fillion's portrayal of Mal ranks up there with the greatest male actors in history.  I'm not overblowing this, I promise.  He has the \\"man's man\\" vibe with humorist sensibilities, able to care about his crew like no other, and threaten to shoot them all for an ideal.  Like Clint Eastwood or Steve McQueen, with vunerability.  I simply cannot believe he hasn't made it \\"big\\", then again, with the quality of the series and ultimate cancellation, maybe I can.  Damn corporate media.
B000002LCD|4.0|Good cd, I really like Madonna's songs on the cd, the others are ok.
B000001F7R|5.0|OTTN is Def Leppard's most creative album, right up there with Slang. Credit goes to Pete Willis & Steve 'Steamin' Clark. Though the next album \\"High N Dry\\" was their heaviest record and was more commercially successful, but its not as creative as OTTN. I think Pete Willis was the man. After he was kicked out from the band, Def Leppard became a pop / rock band. Go for <br />On through the night <br />High N Dry <br />Pyromania <br />Hysteria <br />Slang
B0000AQS0F|5.0|FOX killed this show.  They put it on in the worst timeslot a t.v. week can offer. They aired the episodes out of order; they didn't play the pilot first, which would've hooked everyone who tuned in.  They pre-empted it several times.  Then they cancelled before it had half a chance to recover from the blows they dealt it.  They took a sure thing and murdered it. <br /> <br />Joss Whedon isn't responsible for the failure of Firefly.  He's never put out anything bad, and this show is amazing.  The writer's aren't responsible; the writing was incredible.  The actors aren't responsible; they did a wonderful job. <br /> <br />This was one of the only original shows to come over the waves in a long time, and it was killed by a network that had no idea what it had been given. <br /> <br />If you watch this show, you will not be disappointed.  If you go see Serenity, you won't be disappointed.  This is good art here; it just couldn't escape the network bonfire that seems to catch a lot of good art.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|I remember watching the ads from for this film and thinking, \\"What a piece of crap.\\" <br /> <br />Despite this, and starved of an intake of cinematic vampires, I decided to go along on my birthday last year and hope for some redemptive value to it. <br /> <br />Funnily enough, my initial instinct proved correct. In fact, the film actually managed to be *worse* than what I expected from it. <br />Its opening sequence alone warns you off pretty quickly - we are \\"treated\\" to one of the - surprisingly worst - portrayals of Dracula I have ever seen. Very odd that it was delivered by the normally rather capable Richard Roxburgh. His moments of fury just make you want to laugh. <br /> <br />We also have an Incredible Hulk-like Mr. Hyde, culled from the interpretation featured in \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\\" The character is rather ludacris - helped by the fact that he also smokes...giant cigars. <br /> <br />Frankenstein's monster is no better: he has a sort of glow-in-the-dark fishbowl in his skull in which his brain resides, barely covered by his scalp...which unfortunately tends to slip off once in a while.  <br /> <br />The plot is a monster mash that nearly exhausts Universal's canon of monsters, and wastes any potential they might have had for carrying the story. <br />Still, the sappy part of me did feel *something* for the tragic, \\"Ghost\\" inspired ending. <br /> <br />Not much else to recommend on it, though.
0812550757|5.0|I won't go into what the book is about since you can read that in the preview: <br />Although this book is a \\"sequal\\" to Ender's Game, i think that it stands alone.  It's not really a sequal because the style and theme of this books is so different then Ender's Game.  Ender's Game was a fast paced, easy read and could be enjoyed by anyone.  SFTD is deeper, more philosophical, and drew my emotions in.  Even so, it was still fast paced.  Card's writing is fabulous.  He really knows how to draw you in and make you care about the characters and what's going on.
0761957553|5.0|I was very impressed how fast my book arived. I wish they all would have showed up that fast. Thank you.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I am a coldplay fan, i cannot say i have all of the 3 albums, i have 2 out of the 3 so my review is for those who are curious to listen to coldplay or perhaps want to know more about it... I must compare a \\"Rush of blood\\" to \\"x&y\\" even thought they are 2 different albums. Personally, i must agree that a rush of blood was an instant classic, however, this album comes off as just another album. There is not much that comes out of this album, it is as if coldplay has hit a climax and there is nothing below it. It is indeed a good album, however, i find it to be as meaningless as coldplays selections of words....
B000083E79|5.0|I was not a Cher fan until I heard this CD. Now, it is a staple in my daily music. The sound is clear and the tracks are appropriately arranged. An absolute must to own this CD.
B000002AZ8|5.0|I have every one of Pearl Jam's studio albums and a healthy collection of their live stuff (cd's and dvd's) and for some reason, Vitalogy is my favorite album! I've heard alot of mixed reviews about the album based on its \\"experimental\\" tone but over-all, it pretty much rocks.  There's a broad spectrum of styles covered (and covered well) on this album.  As always, Eddie's vocals are powerful, emotional and inimitable (although so many have tried - hey Scott Stapp, stay off Eddie's nuts!) and the music is amazing.  My favorite tracks are Tremor Christ and Corduroy but every song is solid.  And, of course,  Nothingman, Better Man and Immortality are staples (and crowd-faves) at their concerts.  Now, to the \\"experimental\\" snippets on the album, Pry to and Aye Davanita are basically a couple short jam sessions which fit well within the album.  Bugs is weird but it's good.  And last (and admittedly, probably least) is the last track, Foxymophandlemama...yeah, this one is disturbing, with the kid constantly asking for a spanking.  But skip it and start the album all over again!  PJ rules!
6304698798|5.0|This is one of these movies that doesn't get old over the years. You don't watch it for the story anymore (you know it), just for the way it was shot, the actors, the atmosphere and of course the music !!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah is back stronger then ever emotionally, mentally, and even more lyrically...This album has a variety of ballads to dance hits...it is amazing...you have the hits \\"its like that\\" to \\"we belong together\\" and \\"shake it off\\" and also now feat the upcomming hit \\"get your number\\"...if you get this album you will not be dissappointed trust me..i have 2 copies one in my home and the other in the car.
B00082IJ08|5.0|This album is truly amazing! Every song is different in it's own way but keeps a balance through the album, like Feel good inc. would be a rap song with a little acoustic part, then pop sounding songs such as \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"DARE\\" would give you that dance feeling while listening to the songs. And songs like \\"Kids with guns\\" and \\"last living souls\\" are like blues/rock sounding and they are addicting to listen to. <br />The album is creative and would even be a good road trip soundtrack.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|..Im completely done with that grammy crap if this doesn't win best band that's saving today's music from being complete and total crap.     [...]  Mezmerize is part one of a two part experiment of musical genius. So many different styles of music are brilliantly mixed together AND WORK. Lyrics are deep and thought-provoking, and im sure once Hynotize comes out and completes the project, those of us who can LOOK PAST SURFACES and THINK FOR OURSELVES will be treated to one of the best album(s) created.     I like to think of music like films. If you thought Citizen Kane was about a sled, then dont buy this album. If you think the song \\"B.Y.O.B\\" is trying to purposely be \\"poppy\\" and \\"catchy\\", then buy this album. It's trying to be \\"poppy\\" you ask?      well, here's an excerpt from dotmusic review:    The second album, written and recorded alongside the first, is called \\"Hypnotize\\", which <u>suggests that now they've got our attention with part one they're going to try and change the way we think in part two.</u> Interestingly, \\"Mesmerize\\" starts with the words \\"Welcome to the soldier side\\", suggesting that if this were a double album, part two would be another (more thoughtful?) side entirely.
B000000W5P|5.0|This is one of their best albums because it has the Keith Richards theme song, \\"Before They Make Me Run\\", because \\"Beast of Burden\\" is their most unusual hit single, with a kind of Velvet Underground \\"Sweet Jane\\" feel to it and Mick Jagger seeming to really get down to what Peter Wolf would call \\"Desperation\\".  This is one of their best albums because on \\"Faraway Eyes\\" the band shows they can play like an authentic country and western band as if they were the backup band for George Jones or Merle Haggard and on that same song Mick Jagger displays his one-of-a-kind ability to evoke both humor and romance at the same time.  This is one of their best albums because this is where you hear the virtuosity of Charlie Watts on drums at one of his peaks; and because Ron Wood is able to complement the guitar playing of Mr. Richards in a way that hadn't appeared on record before.  Also, as good as \\"Exile on Main Street\\", \\"Beggar's Banquet\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Let it Bleed\\" are (and they are certainly worth owning, to say the least), this album is \\"better\\" because it shows a depth of personal emotion that is really not present in the same way on any of their other albums.  Released in June 1978, turbulent times for some, well captured on this rock n' roll masterpiece.

0671027387|5.0|After reading this, it is easy to see why Dan Brown sells so many books. The only other book that I read by this author was the Da Vinci Code and I read that just to see what all the fuss was about. Far from being a one-hit-wonder, Dan Brown seems to consistently write novels with timely plotlines and fast action.<br /><br />In Deception Point, NASA discovers a meteorite with astounding scientific implications deep in a glacier in the Arctic. Scientists and civilians from a variety of backgrounds are called in to verify the findings and help announce them to the world. U. S. President Zachary Herney is grateful for this find for political reasons; without NASA's discovery his chance of re-election looked pretty slim.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Senator Sedgewick Sexton is hatching plots to gain the presidency for himself. Since much of his campaign platform centers around dismantling NASA and privatizing the work of this government agency, he has a lot to lose from the discovery of the meteorite. But all is not as it appears to be for either the President or the Senator.<br /><br />The plot is as thick as the glacial ice in the Artic, but the action never freezes.  Pick this one up if you're in the mood for political intrigue.

B000AL730O|1.0|I've listened to the CD only twice so far, but can't seem to get into it. From the above reviews, people are liking it, so I'll keep on listening/hoping. <br /> <br />All but two songs are acoustic, and I love folk. <br />Must keep on listening!
0740748475|5.0|I have all the paperback C&H books, but ever since I heard that this complete set would be published, I knew I'd buy it, and indeed I did, today!  I am middle-aged and loved the strip, as did/do my now-20something kids and my late dad, who would have been 90.  As faithful Watterson fans know, there are timeless themes, incredible wit and hilarious character studies in Calvin & Hobbes.  The art is delightful, the characters wicked and loveable at the same time.  And whoever would have known that comic strip characters would be named after the great religious leader, John Calvin and philosopher, Thomas Hobbes?  I'll be showing this collection to my grandchildren--when I have them--and they'll love C&H too.    The Far Side is gone, but lives forever (and fortunately is available in greeting cards!).  Thank you, Gary Larsen, for publishing a complete collection  of that fantastic strip.       And how blessed we are to still have \\"Mutts\\" (by Patrick McDonnell, [...]) every day.  It achieves the same lofty place as the other two strips mentioned, in its use of art, humor, tributes to music, literature and classic comics, superbly blended with a social conciousness that is compelling yet not preachy.  Not to mention the array of wonderful characters!    Long live Calvin & Hobbes, and thank you, Bill Watterson.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|let me first say that this band has always been a sort of hit-or-miss type group;  the stuff that they do that's good is usually downright amazing, however, they occasionally have a huge mis-step that can be downright embarassing.  typically, their covers have always been good (and good choices of songs to cover as well), and the cover of \\"savory\\" by early '90s post-hardcore stalwarts jawbox, as well as helmet's \\"sinatra\\" and the smiths' \\"please let me get what i want\\" all stick out, as well as \\"no ordinary love\\" by sade which might seem to be completely out of left field to your average nu-metal fan.  however, some of these cuts suffer from poor production (perhaps a re-mastering of some of these works would have been a good idea).  overall, a decent stopgap release before they complete work on their next record, however, i wouldn't put this record in the 'essential' category for anyone but big deftones fans.
B00005NB8K|4.0|When I saw \\"The Doors : Special Edition\\" I hoped that Oliver Stone would have added additional footage into the movie that was originally taken out for time.  That wasn't the case.  The film remains as it has since it's release, and the only addition is a second DVD included with \\"The Road of Excess\\" documentary, a small featurette and interviews with some of the cast, and of course, Oliver Stone himself.<br /><br />While the extra DVD does shed some additional light on the film, I don't believe it adds anything of significance to the original film Oliver Stone presented in 1991.  I gave it 4 stars because of the film itself, the bonus DVD deserves 2 stars.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater with very low expectations from all the reviews I had heard.  But it was far from that.  I think the reason I liked it so much was because it was not completely \\"Hollywood-ized\\".  The acting was great in this movie on all accounts, and the story was wonderfully dark. Sometimes a dark sense of humor is needed in order to enjoy it truly I think.  Which I apparently have.
B000AL730Y|5.0|What can I say? I never expected this to happen again. A McCartney album with such depth. I listened to it more on the first day I got it then I ever listened to the also critically aclaimed Driving Rain. <br />On CACITB you will find no fillers. Every track matters. The only one I'm not realy fond of is A Certain Softness, but that doesn't make it a bad song. A Fine Line is jumpy, joyous and highly listneable. Jenny Wren ranks among the best he's ever done. English Tea makes me laugh and paints pretty pictures like Penny Lane. Too Much Rain, Promise to you girl, At the Mercy, Anyway, Follow Me. It's cleverly arranged, very peronal and as I said no fillers. His last two albums Flaming Pie and Driving Rain were not bad, but I missed the effort he put for example in Flowers in the Dirt, Ram and Tug of War for example. And all those reviewers who compare it to McCartney I and II. Well, he plays most of the instrument himself, but that's were the comparisson stops. Only the hidden track after Anyway could be on McCartney I, but that'just about it. Don't hesitate and buy. O yeah. The DVD is also quite interesting (as far as they go).
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I don't even know where to begin! I could harldy wait for this to be released. First of all, this DVD's sound quality is absolutley top notch. I have a very extensive collection of concert DVDs and the sound quality on this rivals almost every single one thanks to its pristine DTS encoding. The bass on this disc slams cleanly and accurately out of my B&W subwoofer. Whoever filmed this concert is a genius. The camera angles are never distracting or obnoxious, it shows you exactly what you want to see.  <br /> <br />Enough about the A/V. This concert is SICK. SICK! I have all of Eric Clapton's DVD releases, my favorite probably being \\"one more car one more rider.\\" I've seen and heard Clapton play countless solos and sing countless songs but I have never seen an Eric Clapton like this before. He absolutley takes his playing to another level. His solo durning white room put tears in my eyes, literally. As for the rest of cream, it's hard to believe these guys are all in their sixties. There is a 10 mintute+ drum solo on disc two that is sonically spellbinding. It's just an all out rock concert from three exteremely talented muscians. I find it frustrating that my generation (i'm 20) doesn't have many bands that can rock this hard with so much musical skill. When you see this concert you will see muscians playing with emotion backed by years of experience and devloped talent. There are times I was watching this concert and I'm thinking Clapton is back to doing crack because he is so explosivley energetic in his playing. I would not hesitate to purchase this concert, I would have paid 5 times what I did for it.  <br /> <br />On a side note: look for Jude Law and Sean Penn in the audience.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Best rock record out there period. Best rock band out there? Mars Volta is a concept, a supergroup that sound great on record, but live, they can hardly pull off the material. Guitarist Omar Rodriguez is carrying most of the weight in this band, and to tell you the truth, I don't think he knows how to play guitar. When he was in At the drive in, he could get as crazy as he wanted, but still Jim Ward, Paul Hinojos and Tony Hijjar would provide coherence to the chaos. In Mars Volta albums, he depends too much on John Fruciante, bad thing he is not part of the band. Mars Volta is probably modern's day Steely Dan. Saying all that, the record is amazing.

B000002J1L|5.0|Another masterful Genesis album. Its all great. The Standout tracks for me are The Musical Box!!, Return of the Giant Hogweed, Harold the Barrel, and Fountain of Salmacis. All the songs are awesome though.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album is my all time favorite Beatles album. It is a masterpiece of arrangements in both songs and the way the album flows from song to song.<br /><br />The album marks a serious transition in the Beatles' music career. In fact, this album is a strong departure from previous albums. The songs are more mature, the writing is maturing and growing by this stage, and they are actually beginning to experiment more in the studio (e.g. the advent of recording backwards on this album). The guitar work on this album is taking a different texture and maturity as well.<br /><br />The album opens with a George Harrison song, \\"Taxman.\\" This is a first for the Beatles. In fact, there are more Harrison songs on this single album than on any other single album. Moreover, Harrison introduces his audience to the Sitar on \\"Love You To.\\" An instrument that was not used on any of the previous Beatles' albums until this one. There are other small features like this on this album (features that are 'firsts' in music recording or in Beatles' albums).<br /><br />Some of the better songs on the album include - \\"Here, There and Everywhere,\\" \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (which is one of the best Beatles' songs written), McCartney's song \\"For No One\\" (which has a great brass/French Horn melody, and ending that is quite unusual. Also, the ever popular song, \\"Got to Get You Into My Life.\\"<br /><br />This album also contains two number one hits - \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby.\\" However, all the songs on this album are great songs. The combination of Lennon's music with McCartney's music on this album, at this stage in their music, is merging and working well since they are beginning to write all their own material (which actually began to occur on 'Rubber Soul'). Every song has its own individual character, nothing sounds the same, and this is rare for any album. I simply cannot say enough about the differences that are occurring here on this one single album for this band.<br /><br />Even the cover of the album was like no other at this time. The collages and art work have a telling psychedelic style to them - almost as if it is foreshadowing what is to come later on in 60's. If you are just getting introduced to the Beatles then this is a great album to add to your collection. However, in my opinion this is the best Beatles' album ever released. I never get tired of hearing it. I highly recommend this album.this time.

B000002J1M|5.0|Peter Gabriel era Genesis made some of the best music I know of. This album is no exception. It has probably my favorite Genesis tune, Suppers Ready. I think my favorite by Genesis is Selling England by the Pound but this is pretty much just as good. Also get Nursery Cryme and probably Trespass. I just don't own Trespass yet.
1573223026|5.0|This book is about 4 people considering suicide, and what follows from that premise.  The author's style is in the first person point of view, skipping from one main character to the next as the story progresses. <br />Having read all of Hornby's other books, this book is as good as anything he's written.  Much more enjoyable to read than \\"How to be Good\\", which still has a bad tast in my mouth...probably because I expected more from such a gifted writer:)   <br />This book contains the usual amount of  pop-cultral references and humour I hope for everytime I read/reread a Hornby novel.  Hornby's wit is still sharp, but this novel is filled with more complex issues and deep thinking than some of his prior writing.   <br />If you enjoy what it feels like to smile, to laugh, and to think as you read, than this book is a great book for you.
B00011RPB0|5.0|This movie touched me.  From the second it began, I was captivated.  Scarlett's talent is immesurable and her ability to play such a mature and lost young woman with such ease amazes me.  Bill Murray, as always, is unparalleled in his humor and gripping performance.  It was odd for me accept him in a remotely serious role, but this character was perfect.<br /><br />You either love this movie, or you hate it.  I am definitely in the \\"love\\" category.  Perhaps infatuated is a more appropriate word?  Either way, I couldn't have liked it any more.  It is, hands down, one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />I think the real kicker, the real deciding factor of whether or not you will love or hate this movie depends on if you can relate to the two main characters.  Watching this movie for the first time, I was convinced Charlotte was based on me.  It was like watching myself ... everything about her (aside from her breast size ... ahem) was me.  This lost little girl trapped inside the body and mind of a woman.  \\"I just don't know what I'm supposed to be.\\"<br /><br />I don't know, I am not good at reviewing movies I adore so much.  And this probably isn't terribly helpful, but I had to at least put my two cents in.  It's an amazing film.  It's beautiful and moving.  Give it a shot.  And go in with no preconceptions.
0312995423|1.0|Dan Brown would be ashamed to have his name as author of this book, if he weren't so busy raking in the cash from 'Da Vinci Code'.  The only reason DF is published is because of the current popularity of 'Da Vinci Code'.  I could not believe how bad this book was, not only in concept and characterization, but in technical accuracy and sheer implausibility.  'Deception Point' was a much better effort by Brown, and 'Angels and Demons' is also great. If you want to read a great cyber thriller, read 'Snow Crash' by Stephenson or 'Neuromancer' by Gibson instead.

0792839749|4.0|I just revisited my own childhood (to a degree) by watching this splendid DVD version of Ian Flemings once revered Musical/Family drama. This represents a time when wholesome just didn't refer to exotic bread from the local health store, but solid, morally grounded family fun. The story is essentially simple; The car of the title is a former Grand Prix winner now rusting in an English Junkyard circa 1930's, and now resigned to a plaything for two impoversihed local children. These children belong to Dick Van Dyke as good hearted but unrealistically wacky inventor Caractacus Potts, who lives in a windmill with the children and their grandfather. Along comes local Confectionary heiress Truly Scrumptous (yes great name) and adds to the mix for some adventurous escapades with the car, which is undergoing a cosmetic revamping by the aforementioned Potts. Everything is here in the right quantity for a balanced family musical, of the kind sadly seldom seen today. Arguably the car, which is magic, can fly, sail on the ocean, and never look used, is the star, but the real power of the movie lies in simple but excellent script direction, and character portrayal. Evil German Barons, a Fairytale castle, lush English meadows and some other excellent locations weave the tapestry as we watch and the end result is sheer joy. Although some may find the special effects a little obvious by todays standards, the film has more than stood the test of time, and will I feel continue to enthrall and entertain each successive generation. My 3 year old remained glued throughout, and even loved the annoyingly catchy title song which though overdone, is an essential blast from the past - for me anyway, as I still remembered the words! Enjoy

B00003CX9Q|3.0|My kids bought me this dvd for my birthday.  I ripped it open and popped it in the player, eagerly anticipating old childhood memories to resurface.  I own the VHS original, but I haven't watched it for quite some time, so I was a bit excited to get the 'new and improved' version.  I also proceeded with a bit of trepidation because I had heard that there were changes made to the movie that many don't appreciate.  After watching, I can understand and share much of their displeasure.  Spielberg traversed dangerous ground and almost made a classic movie into a cartoonish travesty.  Almost.      First, the scene in the beginning where ET is running from men in the woods was redone so that ET is now Computer Generated, and you actually see him running through the forest.  In the old version you see ET moving through the woods, and admittedly he doesn't seem to be running, as he smothly coasts over the forest floor.  In my chilhood imagination, I always attributed this to the fact that ET had special powers.  Heck, ET could fly - so obviously he used his powers to glide seamlessly over the forested carpet.  But nooooo... Spielberg took all imagination away by creating an ET that looks like Kermit the Frog leaping on lilly pads.  It was truly silly.  Next, in the original scene where ET is walking over the hill towards the town, you only catch a glimpse of him as he goes over the crest of the hill - but in the new and \\"improved\\" scene, you see the entire ET walk off and over the crest, stealing all of the mystique and wonder of the moment.  The whole beginning of the movie was pretty much ruined.  It gets a little better from there, but throughout most of the movie the old ET is replaced by computer generated images.  Sometimes the old ET is still there, but you can always clearly see when the old ET is there versus the new ET.  ET was not ET anymore.  It was truly distracting and disappointing.  There were also a couple of deleted scenes added.  They weren't bad, but it was pretty evident why these scenes were deleted in the first place.  They didn't seem to quite fit.    Still, even with all of the nonsense, I admit that it was still enjoyable.  My little kids liked it, they laughed; and were sad when ET \\"died\\", and sad again at the end when he went home.  There was still enough of the old magic left to make it worthwile.  The movie was decent, but the extra features are probably the best thing about this release.  If you have the original, I'd say don't bother with this one.  Why mess with a masterpiece?
817224164X|5.0|This is a truly remarkable work of political philosophy.  It's nice to have a new translation.  Unless you know the original language, you might consider collecting all the different translations.  What is fascinating about Hitler is how ambitious he was and how innovative he was.  Imagine, your country is under control by rich people who beckon to the political action committees of a foreign nation, and some man comes along and tears it all down and restores your nation's dignity.  I recommend this book to populist voters and independents who are in search of inspiration.  Key to Hitler's success was determination and organization.  His party also had an excellent public image.  I'm sorry, but skin head hoodlums with tattoos on their face isn't going to attract people to conservative causes.  Speakers attired in nice clothes, military or civilian, should be the status quo.  Contrary to the revisionist history pumped in the media, Hitler was not a bad man nor a murderer nor a madman.  Reading this book should make that clear.  Aside from his oddball racial theories about evolution Hitler provides a sound thesis about how that foreign nation seeks to undermine all standards of the West: moral standards, artistic standards, business practice standards and so on.  He is an inspiration for europeans of every nation who have been made the scape goat of other nationals shortcomings.  Hitler was a true visionary whose vision of unadulterated european culture will inevitably come to pass in the future.
B00005QK3D|4.0|Helloween is one of my favorite metal groups. I have all their studio albums. This album is not as bad as people say it is, but it is not as great either. I would not start with this album if your new to the band. But I would add it to your collection.
B00006LPER|1.0|Some of the negative reviews of this movie might be for the wrong reason.  Others don't quite articulate the reasoning well enough to be convincing.  Maybe I can help? <br /> <br />I like philosophy, deep movies, and the French language - so I was looking forward to a fantastic film with compelling new material.  Especially after reading how well it did at Cannes.  Roger Ebert even gave it a big ol' bunch of stars.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the only interesting themes (which were hinted at only tangentially) in this movie were said by psychoanalysts 80 years ago and Jean-Paul Sartre 50 years ago.  Except the difference was that when those thinkers put their ideas out there, they did so in a compelling way that made sense of our innermost feelings and the world around us.  This movie fails miserably in this respect, filling up holes in content with the most over the top violence and sex I've ever seen.  I ended up watching the unrated version, which probably made the entire experience significantly worse than it would have otherwise been.   <br /> <br />Maybe I'm wrong, but I get the feeling that people are rating this movie highly just because of the positive critical reception it got (Cannes, etc.).  The emperor's new clothes phenomenon, you know.  The acting is good - I can't imagine how challenging it must have been to play these roles.  But that's about all I can say for this movie.  Please get something else!

0316776963|5.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day <br />By David Sedaris  <br /> <br /> <br /> This book is about a gay boy and his experiences through life.   It follows the hilarious memories and horrible times in his life.  I chose to read this book because my sister recommended it.  She said she really enjoyed it and that it was funny and well written.  David Sedaris' memoir, Me Talk Pretty One Day, is an outrageously funny account of his life from childhood, through adolescence, and up to adulthood. <br /> In his elementary school days, David Sedaris had a speech impediment and had to take speech therapy.  He hated his speech therapy lessons and decided to avoid saying `S's for the rest of the year.  He bought himself a pocket dictionary.  At the end of the year the speech therapy teacher tried to trick him into saying an `S'.  With many failures the speech therapy teacher decided to tell him a very sad story of her life.   After the story, David Sedaris said, \\"Hey, look.  I'm thorry.\\"  \\"Ha, Ha\\", she said, \\"I got you.\\" [pg. 15].  This was a memorable time in David Sedaris' life because he became more self conscious of himself because of the speech therapy and the teacher drawing attention to it. <br />Also, in his elementary years, his father enjoyed jazz so much and was convinced all of his kids were very talented in music and that he wanted to start a family jazz band.  He enrolled David and two of his sisters into music courses with David playing the guitar.   David tried to play the guitar but ended up with much failure.   Finally, he had enough.  He came home one day and heard his sister, Lisa, playing her flute from the living room \\"it sounded not unlike the wind whipping through an empty Pepsi can.\\" [pg 24] He also heard his other sister, Gretchen, down in the basement.  She was either practicing the piano or \\"the cat was chasing a moth across the keys.\\"  [pg. 24]  Finally, the not so talented \\"Sedaris trio had officially disbanded\\".    From this experience David learned that histalent was not in music and that in order to find his true talent he would have to search through many things such as art and play writing. <br />Another interesting episode in David Sedaris' life is when he tried to learn French.  He took classes with a very strict teacher and other people from all around the world.   In this chapter, everything said in French is translated literally into English.   For example, \\"I know the thing that you speak exact now.  Talk me more, you, plus, please, plus.\\"   [pg. 173].  During this chapter he and the other students start to feel self conscious of whatever they say in French because of this teacher's strict rules so they learn to barely talk at all.   The reason the book is called, Me Talk Pretty One Day, is because it is a literal translation from French.    This part of the story is very important to him because in these classes he learns what people think of the United States, and he realizes how he is labeled by other nations. <br />The book also describes David Sedaris' drug experience, his time living in New York, his homosexuality, and his relationship with his family.    David Sedaris does not learn a whole lot from his odd experiences.  It is basically just what he has been through.  But in the last chapter he explains what he has truly learned from his entire life:  that he's no good and will never be anything big.   <br />

B00005JO0J|5.0|Remember the first time you rode a roller coaster? You can usually predict that first big drop, because of the build-up and that moment you sit, suspended in midair, looking down at the track stretching below you, but after that... you are at the mercy of the coaster. <br /> <br />I am of the opinion that a good movie is like a roller coaster. There may be a predictable first drop, but the rest should be unexpected and thrilling, like a great Six Flags ride. Of course, it's even better when you can't even predict that first drop. And that's what Serenity delivers. Over and over until the very end. <br /> <br />Set 500 years into the future, Serenity follows the story of Captain Malcolm (Mal) Reynolds, a veteran of the galactic civil war that happened between two factions of humans: The Alliance and The Independents. Capt. Reynolds was a member of the Browncoats, Independent Faction soldiers who were opposed to the Alliance in the Unification War. Capt. Reynolds, played beautifully by Nathan Fillion, owns a ship called Serenity, named after the location of the Independent's final defeat. For Reynolds, Serenity is freedom. The ship allows him to take jobs (both legal and illegal) and stay as far from the strong arm of the Alliance as he possibly can. His crew is made up of similar (and not so similar) minded peole who have their own reasons for being on Serenity. These crew members include Zoe (Gina Torres), who fought with Reynolds in the war, and who also happens to be married to the pilot, Wash. Wash, played by Alan Tudyk (28 Days, A Knight's Tale, Dodgeball, Into the West, and Spamalot on Broadway) is the perfect everyman character who is always ready with a well-timed quip. He also plays with plastic dinosaurs in his free time. Kaylee (Jewel Staite) is a young, spunky mechanic who wants to see the universe. She is everyone's friend and brings out a very brotherly protection instinct in Reynolds. Jayne is an assassain, played hilariously by Adam Baldwin (Independence Day, The Patriot, The Inside). Other crew members include a companion named Inara (Morena Baccarin) and a preacher named Book (Ron Glass). Together, this crew makes up a kind of family for Reynolds, and he is fiercely protective of this family. <br /> <br />When Reynolds and his crew take on two passengers, everything changes. Simon (Sean Maher) and River (Summer Glau) are siblings with a secret that some would kill to keep and others would die to spread. Simon, a young and accomplished doctor, took River out of an Alliance facility, and they will stop at nothing to get her back. <br /> <br />The crew of Serenity faces an immense challenge in keeping River and Simon safe from The Alliance, but they face other threats as well. In their travels, they come across the real-life incarnation of camp fire villains called Reavers, canabalistic savages who are said to have gone crazy at the edge of space. Caught between the murderous Reavers and the unrelenting Alliance, Reynolds is not having his best day ever. <br /> <br />If the characters and premise sound a little familiar, you are probably one of the few who saw \\"Firefly,\\" the television show that ran on the FOX network in 2002. Created by award-winning writer/director Joss Whedon and hailed by critics, the show was cancelled after the network aired the second episode first and the first episode last, pre-empting episodes in between for sports coverage and other events, and keeping it in a traditionally difficult time slot on Friday nights. Fans of the show were unwilling to give up on it, though, and they rallied together on the Internet and made their voices heard. A DVD set of the series, including three unaired episodes, was released and spent months in the #1 position on online retailers such as Amazon.com. The active fan base decided the DVD wasn't enough, however, and began rallying for a movie to be made. Universal Pictures stepped up to the plate and greenlit the movie, and Whedon was able to get the entire original cast to return for the feature film. Whedon and the cast have even talked about making the film into a trilogy in the future, depending on how well the first film does. One important thing to note is that you do not have to know anything about the series before seeing the movie. An absolutely stunning opening sequence serves to refresh old viewers and to bring new viewers up to speed in a very elegant and interesting way. However, after seeing Serenity, you may want to purchase or rent the DVD set because you will want to know more about these characters. <br /> <br />Serenity is a blend of all genres: action, sci-fi, adventure, western, comedy, romance, and foreign (the characters speak a little Chinese as part of the blend of Chinese and English-speaking cultures in this version of the future). Though the sci-fi and adventure elements are prominent, the most promient feature is the humor. Whedon is a master of witty dialogue and the intelligent quips that go back and forth between characters is delightful. Character is a focus in this film, and that, in addition to the big explosions and cool space battles, is what makes the film work as well as it does. <br /> <br />Fillion owns the screen as Reynolds in a performance that rivals Harrison Ford's Han Solo. In fact, Serenity has been described as the story Star Wars would have been if it had been about Han instead of Luke. With better writing. And a more believable story. Summer Glau's River is psychotic and scared, vulnerable but extremely powerful. The origin of her abilities and the story behind the secret she carries will not disappoint even the most cynical moviegoer, and the outcome of the film cannot be predicted even by the most perceptive viewer. <br /> <br />In the grand tradition of great Sci-Fi, Serenity has fantastic special effects, spectacular space battles, beautiful scenery and complex, satisfying plots. It will engage every emotion and keep you guessing until the last second, just likea good roller coaster does.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Well written.  Great acting.  Realistic sci-fi (mostly).  Characters you actually get to know and care about.  Reminds me a lot like TOS.  Series was cancelled, movie made and was awesome. <br /> <br />
B00005JNQA|3.0|Pollack is a steady hand at the helm of this movie with rock solid pro performances from a great cast. Unfortunately its the script that ultimately sours this political thriller.    It becomes quite obvious soon into the film \\"who\\" the bad \\"guys\\" are with simple deductive reasoning.  Pollack had a choice of either cluing we the viewers in on who the enemy is or instead keep it a mystery until the films climax. Sadly he chooses the latter. Instead of watching the bad guys plotting their next move Pollack decides to make us guess.  We've all seen enough of these movies to guess pretty much right all though this film. I would still however recommend this movie but only as a rental and not one for the collection. PS definitely not for children, there is a brutal killing (which will be no surprise) at the films opening scene.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|This is a must have for any true Deftones fan.  A terrific collection of covers, b-sides, and rarities.  And while I agree that they should have included the Depeche Mode cover \\"To Have and to Hold\\", it nevertheless is great package.  It includes a DVD of all the classic deftones videos, along with some great concert and backstage footage sprinkled in between.  The packaging is awesome, and basically comes in a hardcover book, with album insert in the center.  A great holdover till the next great Deftones album drops, and a true gift to the legion of devoted Deftones fans around the world.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|man i cant believe the director of this movie sold out to make a few more dollars. this was a hit from the get go. it seems like some hollywood idiot suggested to make the movie \\"better\\" but in reality made it worse. i am extremely disappointed and im sure many of the fans of the original movie feel the same. i want the original back and im upset i wasted my money on a ripoff from the classic.
B0000029AL|5.0|An amazing band these guys. Just read their incredible story in the book WALK THIS WAY. I've been into these guys since I was about ten years old and I tell ya, very rarely have they let me down.<br /><br />I found this record in somebodys basement way back in the day. They told me I could have it and I went home and put it on. I played this record like thirty times a day for weeks. It rules. Initially my favorite track was DREAM ON (of course) but soon learned to love the bluesy tracks the most.<br /><br />MAKE IT- good intro, not the strongest.<br /><br />SOMEBODY- Decent riff, this was the bands warm up song.<br /><br />DREAM ON- you gotta know this song. Its a classic staple.<br /><br />ONE WAY STREET- AWESOME, nice and lengthy blues.<br /><br />MAMA KIN- The other well known. A little overplayed but no doubt a great song.<br /><br />WRITE ME- Very cool.<br /><br />MOVIN OUT-The best song on the record. STEVE TYLERS vocals are a little lower than usual, just very cool stuff.<br /><br />WALKIN THE DOG- The first three seconds are cheese, but it rips into the pattented A-SMITH riff rock that would make their follow up album GET YOUR WINGS one of the greatest blues rock albums of all time! Definately check that one out too, its got balls, man.<br /><br />Anyway, most people get either TOYS or ROCKS first. Those are both exceptional albums but my faves are the first two. Steven Tyler sounds incredibly young compared to his gritty voice on every other album to follow. It's been said that A-SMITH themselves don't like this record and I think that's bogus. Of course they probably had no idea what they were doing recording this and makes them a little insecure. Theres no frills on this peice- You get strait A-SMITH 1973 style, they could have just splayed into a tape deck and made a killer album. THIS STUFF ROCKS!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I bought this DVD with some degree of trepidation given that most of these reunion gigs/albums whatever seldom live up to the hype Rumours have abounded about Jack Bruce's poor health and finances as well as personal emnities between the various band members but in the end I could not pass it up.<br /><br />From the moment that the band walked on the stage I had a lump in my throat and from the very fist note it was clear that in the intervening years since Goodbye Cream the only thing that had changed was the degree of skill and virtuosity that each possessed had increased.<br /><br />I am not churlish about the song selection given the stated number of songs that the trio had played together summed to only 35 as per Bruce including the ones that had never been played. I am sure that each of us has our own favourites that we wanted them to play and we were disappointed by their exclusion but ce la vie. I do agree with others that a gesture to the diehard fans about making available the totality of the concerts available on CD would be a good one. Especially since Eric has done it before regarding his solo performances in the same venue.<br /><br />Before foccussing on the songs I must say that for me the most poignant moment can when they were performing Badge and Clapton left the section attributed to his friend George on the album silent before resuming his blistering, very heartfelt playing. If these shows are about anything it is about learning that life is too short for holding grudges and we should all be thankful of each opportunity to share our wonderful gifts with others.<br /><br />Aside from the music the highlights of this two disc set lie in the camera shot of Brian May in the audience during the performance, another friend who has been a good asscoiate of Eric's in recent years and the brief interviews, alas each done separately giving us insight into the shows.<br /><br />AS for the music, it is a shock to the system to see what these three old men can put out on stage just in terms of the sheer power of the trio. The band rehearsed a lot we know but the blistering improvisations remain outstanding and the Grateful Dead would be proud. The interplay between Bruce and Clapton was a joy to behold and Bruce's bass almost seemed to be alive. Ginger Baker may be getting on a bit but he can still pound the life out of the drum kit.<br /><br />For me Crossroads brought tears to my eyes as did Badge, The initial chords of the blues song seemed an anachronism in an odd sort of way but Clapton has a way of giving each song another idiosyncratic feel at the heart of the blues tradition but at the same time in a very contemporary manner. His seemingly endless capacity to express his emotions in a different way in each song in such an easy manner is incredible and that was no more so in evidence in We're Going Wrong.<br /><br />To me none of the songs were a disappointment even Pressed Rat and Wharthog which even seemed to belong. You almost wanted the discs to go on forever and the surprising thing is that by the end they do not seem to have been on long at all.<br /><br />I thought that I had seen the pinnacle of Clapton playing at the Concert for George in the loving yet mournful rendition of While My Guitar Gently Weeps yet in these shows you found the full gamut of hurt and anguish, joy and pain, being delivered almost offhandedly by a Clapton whose own life experiences have earned him the term blues player. These three guys on the stage infront of such a mixed age audience drew us all in the to excellent playing and in effect into their own intimate relationship. The DVD selection in the fantastic sound derserves to be in every home.<br /><br />Cream we salute thee. The Cream is dead.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|I love this CD. It's the best. Each and every artists has their own little theme of mostly what they talk about. If Avril wants to talk about her past relationships and heartbreaks. LET HER. It's HER music and HER life. NOT YOURS. To the person that said all she talks about it her heartbreaks. Get over it. Actually, she has a lot of songs that doesn't even talk about heartbreaks. At least she is not some DUMB rap star who only sings about TRASHY stuff about sleeping with 100 girls, getting nakes,,,cars...money....and all that other CRAP. She has songs about her past. TRUE songs....not some crappy stuff that has no meaning. <br /> <br />To the person that said she wears 1 inch make-up. SHE IS THE FIRST GIRL ARTISTS that I've ever seen that does not wear POUNDS of make-up. So...thats kinda funny. She only wears eye-liner and mascara. So to that person...you're wrong. She does not wear foundations.  <br /> <br />If she wants to have pale skin. Let her. Pale is pretty. It's better than BURNED skin cancer skin that looks HORRIBALE...by the way. She is REAL....she does not need all that stuff to look good. She is real with herself. She is not like POP stars like Hilary Duff, Lindsey lohan, and any other one of those people who have to starve theirselves to be UGLY skinny. Such as mary-kate. She looks like the walking dead of Hollywood. Every girls does. Avril is the first girl that I've seen that is a star to not do FAKE stupid crap like that.  <br /> <br /> <br />Her wearing black clothes and shopping at Hot Topic? Let her. It's her life, She does not even wear that much black. The concert that i just went to..I dod not see her wear any black. She is REAL with her self. She doesn't have to be FAKE.  <br /> <br /> <br />You must have TRUE hate if you talk about someone that you don't even know. Have you even sat down and listened to both of her cd's and got to know HER and not someone you THINk she is. No....you haven't. Have you ever hung out with her and know who she is? NO....so why would you talk about her. Are you that mad that you can't be her?  <br /> <br />One last thing....she is the only star that I've seen that actually chats and cares about her fans enought to chat with them ON AIM. Have you ever seen how exited she gets when shes about to see one of her fans? Never seen that from a singer before. She is a REAL musician. She actually sings LIVE...unlike singers such as...ashlee simpson....and Hilary. She does really good loud. She really knows how to play the guitar, DRUMS, and piano. Live in concert is the best. Yo can tell she really puts her heart into it to make it the best for the fans.  <br /> <br />I don't have time to try to prove a point on someone that is areally nice person who does not NEED an IMAGE to make money. She is truley the best singer....the most real singer I have ever seen in my life.  <br /> <br />Bye
B0000640SA|5.0|'Memento' is a film that I approached skeptically.  I'd heard nothing but good things, pretty much, but it sounded gimmicky, and like precisely the sort of slightly arty, slightly innovative film that stupid people and mainstream critics will see and proclaim it genius, and, worse yet, somehow imagine that their love of this film make them smart. (I'm no indie/intellectual film snob, mind you, but I can usually spot a sacred cow from quite a distance)  And I suppose I was right, partially, as looking at the review for this it's apparent that more than a few dummards are claiming 'Memento' to be the greatest, most original film ever.  And, yeah, they don't know what the hell they're talking about, but they manage to be almost right anyway.  Still, on top of being a first-rate thriller (well, more or less a thriller anyway.) 'Memento' has got a real human interest angle, and prods into some ideas with regards to reality and perception.(It may not be incredibly revelatory, but few films inspire the mind at all.)<br /><br />I suppose I should summarize the basic plot: Leonard Shelby is on a quest to avenge his murdered wife.  Unfortunately, during the attack he was injured, and can no longer make new memories.  Thus, he's got grope through the present, with only notes and tattoos and instinct to guide him towards his goal.  As you would imagine, this can get pretty damn complicated.  Personally, I don't think the whole backwards chronology gimmick is all that hot of an idea, in and of itself, and it's certainly not original to this film.  Of course, Nolan redeems it through the second conceit, which is that Leonard, has no short-term memory, thus placing us in his shoes, as much as is possible via the reverse chronology. (i.e. he doesn't know what happened in the previous scene, chronologically and neither do we.)  Normally, this would just be a cheap gimmick, an easy way for the director/writer to keep us in the dark, and create cheap, obvious ironies, but now there's actually a legitimate, defensible reason for presenting the film this way.<br /><br />It would be inappropriate to discuss plot details, though suffice to say that the other characters in the film well understand how easy it would be to manipulate a person with no memory.  Still, clever and intriguing as the plot is, the character of Leonard is perhaps the most interesting part of the film.  Personally, I find him to be a great, tragic and highly sympathetic figure.  He's particularly compelling to me, as I find revenge to be a rather romantic notion.  I'm sure many will disagree with me, and say that it's meaningless, but that's precisely the point.  This is heightened by the fact that Leonard will never know if he gets his revenge, not inside anyway.  But, the principle of the thing is enough to drive him.  Of course, we eventually learn that not everything is the way it appears, but this only undermines it all slightly, as there is still abundant reason why he should want to kill John G.  And, Leonard's condition is so hopelessly screwed up and existentially twisted that you can't help but feel for him.  Living completely in a void is a scary thing, and the film helps you  really reflect on these things in a way you probably haven't before.<br /><br />Performances are all excellent, though special note goes, again, to Guy Pearce as Leonard.  He's in a really complicated spot, as there really no guidebook for how to play this role, as he's got to continually be in a sorta semi-confused state, reacting to a scene as he perceives he should, but not really feeling why. (or vice versa)  Nolan's direction is stylish and sharp, though it doesn't draw as much attention to itself as it might have, which is probably a good thing.  The score is effective too, lotsa low-key, pulsing stuff, but still charged with emotion.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a great movie.  Clever plot + emotional resonance.  Usually you only get one, if that.<br /><br />Grade: Aa legitimate, defensible reason for presenting the film this way.

B00000IPAX|5.0|Remarks on \\"Jessica's\\" review. First, the definition of \\"singing\\" is as follows: To utter a series of words or sounds in musical tones. Meaning that Tom's tones can be flat. That is their style of singing and it appeals to teenagers who listen to it because teenagers are going through maturity and our(guy teens) voices can sound like that. Age doesn't matter. So what if they are 50. They are expressing their feelings and thoughts on what a lot of us can't or don't. I don't see any of your records or albums in stores. Mark is the one singing Adam's Song, by the way. The lyrics make perfect sense. You have to be open minded and they don't just throw words around to make it sound good. The song is not meant to be uplifting in any way. The song is depressing. The song allows us(teens) to relate to it because teens go through some very tough times in our years. A lot of teens contemplate suicide. It is part of life. It doesn't mean we(including Blink 182) are stupid and immature for expressing it or singing about it. Heartbreak, depression and loss happens a lot in a teenager's life. Losing girlfriends and boyfriends. Doing poorly in school. Getting a 1200 on the SAT. Failing that one test. Parents barking orders constantly. Fights with siblings. Puberty. Working. Trying to get the 3.0+ GPA to get into a good college. Very stressful for us. These are the beginning years of our adult life. Blink 182 expresses all that we go through and we thank them for it. All of them possess incredible talent in playing their instruments. Some of their songs I am in awe because I know how hard it is to play and sing at the same time. They have earned every dollar they have made while being the greatest band, Blink 182. I am also writing this because you obviously have no life if you write reviews for Amazon. I am only here because I have a Xanga and I chose Adams Song as my entry song and a link took me here and just scrolled down to find that you actually spent TIME writing, what you probably think, a truthful, honest and informational review. Blink 182 is the best. Cheers to all.  <br /> <br />-Jackal_v01
B00009V8Z9|5.0|With soulful, poetic lyrics and amazing music parts GAvin Degraw is surely not like any other artists out there today. HE is mostly know for his single I don't wanna be which is ONe TRee HIll's theme song. But all of this artist's good songs are more than what he is really known for. Each song is unique and has a different feeling of it's own. One of my Favorites being Just Friends, and Chariot, this CD and artist is worth it...you won't be dissapointed

B000077VPU|1.0|When I bought this DVD, I was under the impression it was a re-release of the VHS concert. I have the VHS version and was wanting to update my collection. The problem is - the quality of video on the DVD is very poor, most of the concert was cut out, the commentary by the celebrities about AIDS awareness was edited out as well. (Half the basis behind the concert in the first place.)  My opinion - DO NOT BUY THIS DVD !!! I'm throwing mine away.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Given the current state of the Union. This concept CD is more relevant than when originally released. Ignoring the lyrical content, the musical arrangements are very intricate with awesome syncopation and the related crescendos. A true classic that should be included in all audiophiles music library.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|I was actually WAITING for a new updated Warriors release, because I knew that 25 years were coming up. <br /> <br />I WAS pleased to see the stories behind the making of the movie but I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the finished product itself. <br /> <br />Where did all of these cartoon cutouts come from between scenes? <br /> <br />Was this REALLY Walter Hill's vision in 1978 or 27 years later in 2005? <br /> <br />I could have ignored all of that, but, to me, the most egregious error is Hill cutting off the last scene in the movie, during the credits, when they were all walking off into the sunrise. <br /> <br />That was a nice way to end this movie and I don't know WHY he was so fascinated with this comic book motif, that he would cut this scene off COMPLETELY to use these comic book pictures to end the film. <br /> <br />However, I'll still give it three stars because this is the first time I've seen this cult classic on dvd.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This is a great album by Damian \\"Jr. Gong\\" Marley, you can see his growth as an artist. Obviously, Stephen Marley is behind most of the tunes and mixes, but you should also know about Gus \\"The Professor\\" Alcala, he's not in the credits but is supposed to be behind some remixes of this album, like Move! & Confrontation, I think he's been doing work with the melodymakers for a while now, but kind of low key. So a big big shout out to him. Definately a must buy for any Marley Fan. <br /> <br />IRIE
1563898586|5.0|I'm one of those people who saw the film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen long before I ever read the comic books.  I once thought the film was awesome, but after having the read the original stories, I now realize the movie could have been so much more!  What's so extraordinary about this league?  I'm glad you asked...<br /><br />Let me catch you up to speed if you're not familiar with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  The stories take place in England in the late 1890's.  The characters are icons of literature such as the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, and Alan Quartermain.  The government of England assembles them to battle extraordinary circumstances within its borders.  The first volume deals with a famous villain who shall remain nameless, and the second volume deals with a Martian invasion, ala the famous tale by H.G. Wells.  Both volumes are rife with literary allusions, so an old literature nerd like myself was flying high throughout.<br /><br />The author of these volumes is the eccentric but highly respected creator by the name of Alan Moore.  He's brought us many classics, but he is most widely known for his masterpiece, the mid-eighties magnum opus known as the Watchmen, which is largely responsible for moving comics out of the \\"comics are for kiddies\\" paradigm.  He is obviously a connoisseur of the literary classics, for he has so many references to works of literature throughout these volumes that two companion pieces have been produced explaining the dozens of nuances found within (think of it like Breaking the Da Vinci Code for Dan Brown's ultra-popular novel).  Although his writing is at times disturbing, Moore is an expert at what he does and his stories are always captivating.  The further characterization of such classical characters and bringing them together in such odd situations and having them interact, well, it's completely delightful.<br /><br />The artist is a man named Kevin O'Neill, and I was largely unfamiliar with any of his previous work.  However, his style is perfect for this type of story, and his careful attention to nineteenth century architecture and dress is phenomenal.  Again, like the author, some of his drawings are quite provoking, but they are all magnetic in their execution.<br /><br />I would completely recommend these two volumes for a reader wishing to break into only the best of comics in their trade paperback form.  Be mindful, however, these comics were not released as mainstream works, so they don't play by mainstream rules.  Very gory scenes, matched with the first and only actual sex scene I've ever seen in a comic book, requires an open-minded and tolerant reader.  You won't be disappointed in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, I'm quite certain of that.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]y unfamiliar with any of his previous work.

Be mindful, however, these comics were not released as mainstream works, so they don't play by mainstream rules.  Very gory scenes, matched with the first and only actual sex scene I've ever seen in a comic book, requires an open-minded and tolerant reader.  You won't be disappointed in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, I'm quite certain of that.    ~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|This was a hard product to find when I first started searching, but Amazon had it! My daughter wanted this movie (DVD)really bad so I had to get it for her.  The movie arrived promptly.  It was of excellent quality (and great price).  My daughter and I enjoyed the movie very much! How can you go wrong with Johnny Depp?  I was very impressed for this was my first purchase from Amazon.com.  I won't hesitate to order from Amazon again.

B0002O7XW2|4.0|Horror maestro John Carpenter's underrated adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the better King page to screen adaptations, and it's one of Carpenter's most suspenseful.  Keith Gordon (Back to School) plays Arnie, a picked on high school kid who gets the car of his dreams with Christine, the only problem is no one else seems to like it, and it's not long before various people start getting picked off.  While it's doesn't stay completely faithful to it's more spooky source, Christine manages to be an all the more terrifying excursion into suspense.  The visual effects for their time are good (including some nifty and creative camera tricks), and the finely chosen cast (including future Baywatch star Alexandra Paul and Harry Dean Stanton) do great work.  Carpenter's effectively creepy score also works great, and it livens up suspenseful scenes.  This special edition DVD includes a lively commentary by Carpenter and Gordon, as well as some interesting featurettes on the film's creation.
1400032717|4.0|Haddon paints a moving portrait that takes us inside disability and the stresses that it can cause to families while simultaneously crafting a gripping novel. Christopher Boone is an autistic savant with brilliant mathematical abilities but serious difficulty with emotional understanding. He tells the story from his perspective. As such, he supplements the narrative with expositions of his favorite probability and mathematics problems or his fascination with order and familiarity. Christopher's detours into his thoughts and his world help us truly come to know and care about him. This is one of the book's greatest strengths: as a reader, I found myself truly concerned for Christopher's welfare at points, wishing I could intervene. (Perhaps that will make me more likely to intervene when faced with those situations in reality.) And yet, observing his behavior, I can also begin to understand the frustrated reactions that his parents sometimes manifest. <br /> <br />The story is gripping. For several days, I couldn't put the book down, anxious to learn the answers to both the initial mystery (who killed a neighbor's dog?) and the other mysteries that are uncovered along the way. The book is also visually engaging: Christopher intersperses the text with diagrams and drawings to effectively convey his thoughts. <br /> <br />Overall, this book was a pleasurable read with significant substance. <br /> <br />Note to readers who care about this sort of thing: the book has a fair amount of strong language and references to extramarital relationships (which is a euphemism that Christopher wouldn't like, since we all have extramarital relationships, just not the kind I'm referring to here).
B00005JNY4|4.0|Don't be deceived by the bad reviews.  This popcorn film is not meant to be anything more than an involving, great-looking suspense-filled action adventure, semi-romantic, thriller.  And it delivers.<br /><br />Spend some time with beautiful people in an exotic setting.  Go diving, find treasure and get in big trouble.  Action scenes are thrilling.<br /><br />Imagine you've been betrayed by a stupid, greedy old friend and his new, coke whore girlfriend.  You're beautiful lover is in jeopardy because of it.<br /><br />And here's a downed plane full of dope and a pirate ship filled with gold and you're running out of air, fighting for your life while surrounded by hungry sharks.<br /><br />Fabulous underwater photography and lots of taut, tanned skin of both sexes.<br /><br />This terrific, under-rated flick looks especially good on a big screen.  I liked it a lot.  Way more than I expected and so did my wife.  And she's a very picky movie goer.
B00006678I|3.0|Singing nuns, flying nuns, nuns on the run, nuns everywhere in the 1960s! And it's Dr. Elvis in the ghetto! Can you really see Elvis Presley taking a medical exam? Better casting would be Fabian Forte as a nuclear scientist, or Frankie Avalon as a U.N. diplomat, or Sandra Dee solving the world hunger problem. (Then again, Frank Sinatra once played a Catholic priest.) Three happening nuns--Mary Tyler Moore, Jane Elliot and Barbara McNair--venture out into the Real World and it doesn't take long before horny Puerta Rican men with drinking problems try to feel them up. If that weren't bad enough, cranky old Causcasian women looking out of windows make snaps like: \\"She's black as the ace of spades!\\" It's 1969 and America has REAL PROBLEMS--and our ladies with their exquisite bone structures are ready to get down and funky with the street. They volunteer at a free clinic presided over by King Elvis, slimmed down and in the middle of his 1968-1970 prime. Still high from his '68 Comeback Special and a few months away from his Vegas revival, Big E is obviously just getting this contractual obligation out of the way. He fidgets around in every scene, like he can't wait for the director to yell \\"Cut-Print\\" so he can horse around with his Memphis Mafia. It's the usual Presley screen persona, surly, unpleasant, condescending, peeved at every little thing. (Hardly acting, Elvis hated these movies.) Elvis would tell MTM that she was the first of his leading ladies he never shacked up with. (One thing's for certain, though, their hair dye came out of the same bottle.) There's some ludicrous symbolism involved in this turkey. Elvis plays John Carpenter. Get it? JC? John Carpenter? Jesus Christ? Jesus was a carpenter? Jesus was the King? So was the Man from Memphis? Cough-cough. Dr. Elvis comes on to Sister Mary Tyler Moore and in the last scene of the movie her gaze goes from Elvis to Jesus to Elvis to Jesus and we're forever left wondering which one she chooses. (Considering how Ebecame a fat druggie, let's hope she made the right decision.) This was Presley's last regular movie.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|So this is how you screw up a classic. I thought I was going to see an extended edition with deleted scenes but what I got was this comic book crap that softens up a formerly hardcore movie. This re-edition insults me. I don't need you to tell whats going on while I'm watching the movie because I already got it the first time. The new opening sequence really sucks. I don't need that Greek cartoon introduction. One of the things that made the original so tight was that it started off hard and now its all soft... just makes me sick. They showed a clip of a deleted scene between Cleon and his girlfriend earlier that day before they left for the Bronx and if they had of cut that type of stuff back into the movie than that would have been okay but the whole comic book  idea was corny and I'll be selling the one I bought today and I vow to never watch it again because now the original is going to be a collectors item. This is garbage! Do not waste your money on this abomination of a classic. Just remember it the way it was because this new version almost ruins the movie for me and I've always been a big fan...(of the original!!!)

6301562925|4.0|I'll begin by giving a brief rundown of where I stand. The 1st Halloween was a classic, and will probably be seen by most people as the best. Part 2 was a decent watchable movie. Part 3, as most of you know, has nothing to do with the series, so we'll just say no comment. (I did kind of like Part 3, but it is not really part of this story.) In my opinion, Part 4 was a big improvement. Looking ahead, Part 6 had its moments. After Part 6, with the wonderful Donald Pleasence 'Dr. Loomis' gone, (God Rest His Soul), the 2 movies that followed were pure trash to say the least. (Just an attemt to make some money off of something that had a built in audience. An absurd mark on the series. As if we Halloween fans didn't know that what made the Halloween movies was the chemistry between Michael's evil and the psychological turmoil the benevolent Dr. Loomis was going through as he tried to stop Michael. HOW DARE SOMEONE NAME THOSE 2 FARCES HALLOWEEN!!!)  Onto the subject at hand. Part 5 certainly is different from the classic 1st chapter. But of course there are going to be some notable differences when a transition is made from the 70s into the 80s. (No disrespect towards Part 1 intended.) Part 5 starts with a quick flashback to the end of Part 4, which allows us to see how Michael survived yet again. We are then moved into the present. (A year later) Michael's niece, and Jamie Lee Curtis' daughter Jamie is going through psychological traumas, which interestingly give her some psychic abilities. (Alright) The movie then offers some time of normalicy, with some comic relief and foreshadowing of what is to come. I know some people knocked this movie for being more comical then the others, but I think this was actually a smart move. One weakness of Part 1 and 2 (in my opinion) was that many of Michael's victims were on the stiff 2d side. With the comical touches Part 5 adds, we get to know Michael's eventual victims and feel a little more sorry for them. Also, the presence of some comedy undelines the horror more. (Extremes can flatter each other if well done.) Another aspect of mystery is a cloaked man who seems to wander the scenes with no purpose, but in the very last moment we realize at least part of his purpose. The bulk of his purpose will be revealed in Part 6. (Curse of Michael Myers) I don't want to say too much and ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, but I think part 5 really had the best mixture of suspense, comic relief, and horror. The ending could NOT have been better if Michael and Dr. Loomis had written it themselves. It is in this 5th chapter that Dr. Loomis really shows his heroic side, his touching side, and his frustrated and determined side. SIDE NOTE: This chapter really shows the final and climactic battle between Dr. Loomis and Michael. To be sure, Dr. Loomis does have a significant part in the concluding 'Curse of Michael Myers.' However, Donald Pleasence's state of health at the time prevented him from having any direct confrontations with the simply evil Michael Myers. FINAL WORD: If you liked Parts 1, 2, and 4, be open to the fact that 5 is a little different. It is a great chapter and in my opinion, arguably the best.me comedy undelines the horror more.

1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon's novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is much more than a simple murder mystery. It is a story that lets you feel what it is like to cope with Autism or Asperger's syndrome. The hero, Christopher John Francis Boone, is mathematically gifted and socially challenged. Christopher would probably be diagnosed as having a high functioning case of Asperger's syndrome.  <br /> <br />Christopher discovers his neighbor's poodle impaled on a garden fork. The dog's owner finds Christopher holding her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves to discover who has murdered the dog. Siobhan, a social worker at his school, encourages Christopher to write a book about his investigations, and the result is \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime\\".  <br /> <br />Since the book is written from Christopher's viewpoint, it allows the reader to see the world as Christopher or another Asperger might see it. While walking in Christopher's shoes you recognize that: <br /> Christopher takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out what he views as the strange behavior of his elders and peers. <br /> He is usually incapable of understanding other people's facial expressions.  <br /> When he visits a subway for the first time, he is overwhelmed by the intense visual and audio stimulation and sits for five hours in the station trying to cope with the stimulation before he is able to focus on finding the subway he wants. <br /> He successfully uses calming techniques taught to him by his social worker. <br /> He hates it when his family takes him to Paris, because he prefers the security of the routines in his home. <br /> He puts his head on the ground and groans when information is coming faster than he can process it. <br /> He develops routines. He won't eat brown or yellow food. If a certain number of cars of a particular color pass, he is convinced itwill be either a good or bad day. <br /> Christopher can't stand being touched, even by his parents, so he and his parents greet each other by stretching out their hands and touching finger-tips. <br /> He uses logic and strategies he learned from mystery novels to determine how to find the dogs killer. <br /> <br />Christopher's parents are challenged and damaged by Christopher's needs and problems, but they clearly love him and are able to meet most of his needs. Christopher seems unable to connect with his parents, but he successfully passes a major math test and plans on going to college once he finishes school. Not all children suffering from Autism or Aspergers can do as well, but it is good to know that some can function in the normal world. <br /> <br />The author taught autistic children for several years, and his knowlege and love of children permeates his book. I think this book is useful because it helps the reader develop the ability to better understand how a child with Asperger's syndrome \\"sees\\" the world. This ability may be helpful, because the percentage of children being diagnosed as autistic or having Asperger's syndrome is rising dramatically.  <br />
B000A3DFZE|4.0|While I would be willing to listen to Clapton play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in the blues mode, I find this album is a little more pop than blues or rock.  I prefer the straight out old fashioned blues guitar from Clapton,but this is definitely an enjoyable CD.
0790734850|5.0|A truly great \\"cops and robbers\\" movie has to have a strong plot, plenty of suspense, tough guys on both sides, a love interest, good directing, sharp dialogue, and enough twists and turns to keep us off-balance.  We don't always have to understand every step but we have to be able to put it together in the end.  Icing on the cake is when the acting is top-notch as well.  There have been a number of such movies over the years and I was very happy to see in \\"LA Confidential\\" the evidence that Hollywood can still make them.   <br /> <br />The term \\"Film Noir\\" is somewhat overused these days but it applies to \\"LA Confidential\\".  What makes it all the more interesting is how the film noir motif is coupled with modern-day perspectives on such things as race, vice, and ambition.  This movie would have been a good 30 minutes shorter if made in the 1950's but it is a better film for its' extended analysis of its' surroundings.  The mystery becomes more personal as we get a better understanding of the characters.  That, too, is aided by the quality of acting.  For me, the top kudos go to Kevin Spacey (who hasn't always impressed me in other movies) and Kim Bassinger.  Newcomer Guy Pearce was probably a bit mis-cast and James Cromwell may have had too much trouble trying to shake off his character in \\"Babe\\".  Russell Crowe gives one of his better preformances and is more audible than he is in later movies.  The ubiquitous Danny DeVito got to be a bit much at times but we were supposed to dislike him anyway.  Altogether they keep us rivited to the action on film all the way to the very end.  In the process we get comments on racial injustice, police corruption, immorality in high places, yellow journalism, etc. etc. etc. <br /> <br />This is a movie I enjoy seeing again.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat.

Vorian is a 15 year-old trapped in a 135 year-old body.  <br /> <br />I mean this thing is just so full of holes that if you took the Dune reference away this would be a complete waste of time and money.
067144901X|5.0|This is my son's absolute favorite book!  He is 14 months and is just starting to identify animal sounds. He doesn't say many words, but each time we get to the \\"three singing pigs say La La La\\", he shakes his head vehemently and says No No.  Then when we get to the duck he says \\"quack quack\\".  It's great to see him anticipate the animal sounds on each page and to really see his learning and memory skills build each time we read the story (and we read it at least 3 times per day). <br />Sandra Boynton creates wonderful board books for infants!  They are fun for parents to read, have cute illustrations, and are the perfect length for an infant's short attention span.  And the hard cardboard pages really withstand my son trying to chew on the corners.

6304696558|4.0|Goldie Hawn plays the part of Judy Benjamin, a young socialite who is widowed on her wedding night. Distraught and with no purpose to her life and no skills to speak of she appeals to the listeners of a radio show to help her. One of the respondents is an army recruitment officer who, having convinced Judy that army life really consisted of yachts and condo's and sunbathing in California, manages to get her to sign up for 3 years. This is where the comedy really starts as Judy, who has never had to lift a manicured finger, gets a reality check and discovers that being in the army is not like being on holiday. Goldie Hawn is made for this kind of role, and as usual delivers the goods. There are some genuinely 'laugh out loud' moments as she struggles to adapt and make friends. Unfortunately the film seems to run out of steam half way through. Whereas the first half is true comedy, the second half has very little in the way of humour to offer. Having met a French gynaecologist who she falls for, she wangles a posting to Paris to be with him. This is where the humour disappears as Judy leaves the army to be with him and he turns out to be a control freak that turns Judy into a clone of his ex girlfriend. It's almost like watching two separate films.<br /><br />Goldie Hawn is as brilliant as ever and really suits the part of kooky blonde. In fact, without her the movie would probably fall flat on its face. All in all this is a movie that has stood the test of time and is still worth watching if only for the hilarity of the first half. Just be prepared for the laughs to disappear.
B0009WFFS6|1.0|Being a huge cream fan, I was ecstatic when I heard they were reforming and even thought about flying to England for the shows. Unfortunately I did not make it but a cohort of mine's friend went to England and taped one of the shows. I was graced with a copy and you can imagine the anticipation I felt to hear what these guys sounded like after all these years. Man was I disappointed. Ginger Baker sounded like he was asleep behind the drums, none of Clapton's powerful but economical phrasing that graced Fresh Cream was present and it struck me alot like a bad nostalgia act. When I heard Deserted Cities of the Heart, I thought \\"Hey I remember that song, it was a good one\\". Not that there weren't moments but they were few and far between. So I had in my mind that the bootleg I owned was from the first nite and they were just having an off night. They were nervous, hadn't played together in years etc. I bought the DVD today hoping things would be different and they were not. To be fair, the highlights of what I watched today were Jack's vocals. The problem is the playing was hardly inspired and pretty weak, except for the outtake of We're Going Wrong. Clapton's playing was terrible, if you bother to listen to the lines he was playing. Pure garbage. His intonation is off and his tone is the worst I've heard from him in years. Which surprises me because most things I've seen up until this point including the Cream induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, his appearance of Don't Think Twice on the Bob Dylan memorial concert, his tone was great. There is no fire and hardly any sparks. If there was more attention to great melodic phrasing in the playing and a great interplay between the players I would say its a sign of maturity. There is not. A guy like Johnny Winter ain't the flashy guitarist he used to be but his phrasing is tasty and succint. Mature Eric ain't no Johnny Winter and Johnny can barely stand. Clapton has no excuse. Some may make the excuse for a guy like Baker who used to hit hard and is now playing pretty limp wristed that \\"Well, he's old\\". Elvin Jones was old the last time I saw him and he still had the old fire he used to have. If you compare this to DVD to there induction performance into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 93, its night and day. There is no comparison. In closing, if this were a bar band down the street jamming to some old Cream tunes, I might pay $10 on a Friday nite. I certainly wouldn't pay $80 - $400 of what they are charging to play Madison Square Garden. Not when its the original guys who inspired so many.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is a surprisingly good film and sorely underrated. Set in a future where emotions are banned, as is anything that may engender emotion such as music and literature, the storyline may conjure thoughts of 1984 or Fahrenheit 451. Make no mistake however; Equilibrium is no copy of those films.<br /><br />After World War 3, it is decided that emotions lead to war and the prevention of further war can only be achieved by preventing the population from feeling. Every day the population have to take their prescribed mood dampening pills. Christian Bale stars as Preston, a law enforcement agent, who seeks out and destroys `sense offenders', people who stop taking their medication and who actively read and listen to music. When Preston's partner (played by Sean Bean) is found to be a sense offender and he is forced to kill him, Preston starts questioning his world and the part he plays in it. He decides to take the dangerous path of skipping his pills and starting to feel.<br /><br />This is no fast action, special effects stuffed movie although there are a few high action scenes, involving some well choreographed martial arts fighting. However, for the main part, this film relies on its chilling mood and soulless scenery to create an all too realistic sense of menace. It has been well produced and the cinematography is first class. This is science fiction at its best.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" seems to be a movie that you either love, or love to hate. I'll admit, the first time I saw this movie, I didn't get it. Then I realized that there really wasn't much to get, which is what makes the movie so great. There's really isn't much of a plotline, but the hilarity of the characters makes up for it. From the set and costume design to the characters themselves, the movie is just plain funny. Another thing that makes this movie worthwhile is that it's capable of holding different meanings for different people. Some see it as purely comedic fun, others see it as a sort of coming of age story, and some people just don't see anything in it at all. However you feel about this film, you have to admit it's definitely one of a kind.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Who would've ever thought it would happen? The legendary British supergroup Cream called it quits in 1968 and apart from a few one-off reunions (such as their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame), the band hadn't played together since then. However, all things must come to pass eventually for in May 2005, it finally happened. Cream reunited for four sold out concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall (the very same place they performed their farewell concerts 37 years earlier) and the magic was not only rekindled, it was also like the band never went away.<br /><br />The double-CD document of these four momentuous nights features Cream in top notch form with Eric Clapton letting rip with his best guitar work in years, Jack Bruce providing his trademark muscular bass work and commanding vocals and Ginger Baker's powerfused drumming sounding arguably better and more solid than Cream's initial run in the '60s.<br /><br />There is not a single weak performance on the CD and overall definitely shows that even though Cream has been away for 37 years, the chemestry between these three musicians never left. While classics such as \\"I Feel Free\\", \\"Tales Of Brave Ulysees\\" and \\"Strange Brew\\" are absent here, there are plenty of other classics to digest during the nearly two hours of music  including \\"I'm So Glad\\", \\"Sweet Wine\\" \\"Spoonful\\", \\"Badge\\", \\"Crossroads\\", \\"White Room\\", an awesome performance of Baker's drum spotlight \\"Toad\\" and, of course, \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" among many others.<br /><br />This is definitely an historic live performance from one of rock music's pioneering bands. Not a single note is out of place and the band sounds as fresh and youthful as when they initially formed nearly 40 years ago. Also, there are absolutely no guest musicians or sidemen onstage with the band during these performances. What you hear is just Eric, Jack and Ginger giving their all and believe me, it is awesome!!!<br /><br />Welcome back Cream!!!
B00005JO0J|5.0|Serenity Flies High <br /> <br />In 2002, Joss Whedon, the creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel' brought to television a new series called 'Firefly.' Despite being loved by the fans, it was unjustly tried and convicted by studio execs and killed off after only airing 11 episodes. 'Serenity' is the major motion picture from the 'Firefly' 'Verse... <br /> <br />The film starts off with some background on the characters of Simon and River Tam, and how Simon frees her from an Alliance \\"school\\" where she has been subjected to numerous horrific tests. We also are introduced to the main Villain of the film, \\"The Operative.\\" His job is to find the Tam's and bring them back. <br /> <br />We then cut to the ship \\"Serenity\\" as she is flying through space towards a planet where it's crew - lead by Captain \\"Mal\\" Reynolds, has a job waiting for them. Captain Reynolds and his crew are - for lack of a better term - people for hire. You need something done/stolen/etc., you call on the crew of \\"Serenity.\\" We also learn that two of the \\"crew\\" of \\"Serenity\\" - Shepherd Book and Inara Serra - have left the ship in the intervening months (this film supposedly takes place 6 months after the \\"Firefly\\" episode \\"Objects in Space\\"). <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that things go wrong, and this leads directly into the peril that the crew will face from the \\"Operative\\" and his masters, the \\"Alliance.\\" Captain Reynolds and his crew have several tasks to undertake: keep one step ahead of the enemy; find out what secret is driving River Tam insane, and protecting themselves against other evils, not only in the blackness of space, but the evil that man can do to his fellow human beings. <br /> <br />This all comes together in an enormous space battle between the Alliance and a group of mutants called \\"Reavers.\\" It seems like nearly every science-fiction movie has to have a space battle, but this one was very smartly thought out. <br /> <br />The music was composed by David Newman, and hedid a magnificent job. He had action cues where needed, suspenseful cues when called for, and basically hit every note right in scoring this film. It definitely added to the story, as most excellent film scores are designed to do. <br /> <br />There is almost everything in this film that any fan of Firefly, or any fan of science fiction, can appreciate. It has suspense, warmth, action, adventure, terror, and all of it rolled up into a two-hour movie. This is a film that actually was intelligently shot and produced, not like many films that come out of Hollywood today, where you can check your brain at the door because of the films' simplistic and stupid pandering to the masses. \\"Serenity\\" stands above all that: it brings you into the story, does its level best to get you emotionally attached to the characters, so you feel what they feel, and care about them. That is the function of a well-written film: to get you involved with the characters. <br /> <br />Hopefully this is not the end of Captain Reynolds and the crew of \\"Serenity\\" on the big screen (or small screen). A film (or television show) like this comes only once in a great while, and it deserves every accolade it can garner. Fans of the TV show and non-fans alike will be able to enjoy this film. The fans because they can re-connect with their favorite characters and the non-fans can enjoy a great science-fiction film.

She's a top drawer actress even though lately her movie choices have been less than impressive.  She really deserved her Oscar for this movie. The movie contains all the horrors of contration camps that you've seen in scores of other similar themed movies, but it is her riviting performance that will really impress you.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|You know, for all of their blind loyalty over the years, Star Trek Fans really deserve better then this. 'Nemesis' is probably the pitiful death-kneel of a once-proud franchise that was driven into the ground by a group of people at Paramount (led by Rick Berman) that just have little or no idea what made Star Trek so endearing. <br /> <br />The acting is just terrible. Patrick Stewart just looks like he's going through the motions. I think it's clear that he wants to move on to other things.  Creatively, I think he's visibly bored.  Jonathan Frakes is a TV actor and still hasn't made a comfortable leap to the big screen, and Michael Dorn's Worf has basically become a Klingon stereotype. This brings me to the sad story of Data. First of all, you can't spend almost 16 years playing out the whole Pinocchio storyline with Data. All of those \\"I don't understand humanity and yet aspire to be human\\" moments have stopped being endearing quite some time ago, now they're just annoying. His big scene at the end of the movie (I'm really trying not to drop any spoilers) was just totally devoid of any kind of emotion (or emotional impact) at all. His dual role as B-4 (get it? \\"Before\\") is just terrible, clearly done just in case there's a sequel. The rest of the crew make a cameo, but are essentially given absolutely nothing to do.  Buried in the void of this film are also Dina Meyer and Ron Perlman.  You'd honestly never know they were there. <br /> <br />When 'Nemesis' was being made I had a glimmer of hope for the film.  I thought that bringing on director Stuart Baird as a fresh start was a good way to move off of a creative rut I saw the franchise in.  Baird was a long-time understudy of Richard Donner, so I thought, at worst, the film would be exciting.  It didn't work at all though.  One of the reasons that Star Trek works is because of its attention to detail and the ability to respect its own continuity and rules.  'Nemesis', unfortunately, didn't do any of that.   <br/> <br />The plot is riddled with conflicts of logic. Shinzon is the double for Picard and explains that \\"other then his jaw and nose being broken years ago, they look identical\\"? What? This guy's face is as smooth as silk! If anyone could have gotten away with that kind of a statement, it should probably have been Picard! Stewart, just be virtue of being older, could very easily have had those injuries in his youth. <br />How could the Enterprise have rammed a vessel when they had no shields and the opponent's shields were at 70%? Wouldn't the Enterprise have just broken up on the front of the other ship? I also love villains who cart around a Death-star caliber weapon and don't use it. I could actually keep going too; this is just the short list! <br /> <br />So far the Next Generation movies are just 1 for 4 with 'First Contact' being their only redeeming moment. Gene Roddenberry would be turning in his grave if he knew the state his beloved franchise was in right now. I'm actually praying that there isn't an 11th movie. If there is, there had better be a complete, top-to-bottom turnover in its creative team right up to Rick Berman. What they have now is just NOT getting the job done
B000001GRZ|5.0|Even all these years later, this is probably the best interpretation of these works out there. Fournier had incredible control and the strength of sound necessary for these wonderful works. His suites are the most musical and dance-like of all versions I've heard, and when you consider that the cello suites are essentially a series of dance movements, this approach seems appropriate. Don't let the recording date fool you, this set sounds great as DG/Arkiv used their super-bit image processing technique to clean up the old recordings. Heinrich Schiff, Janos Starker and Mstislav Rostropovich all have recorded great sets since this one was set to disc; none offer the level on insight shown here by Fournier, the consummate tasteful cellist.    This is the penultimate set out there.
B00005JNQA|4.0|Pollack is a wonderful director, isn't he? I enjoy his body of work immensely and the Three Days of the Condor film, now 30 + years old, remains in the top 3 or 4 of the 'Hitchcockian character up against the evil empire' movies. And the evil empire ain't the Russians!<br /><br />I don't think the Interpreter compares favorably to Condor, for argument's sake, and while Kidman and Penn surely hold their own against Dunnaway and Redford, I think the script was if not weak, confused.<br /><br />First of all, that these two characters, Silvia the interpreter (Kidman) and Keller the Secret Service Agent (Penn) are damaged goods make them so much more interesting. They are superior actors and they strut their stuff well. And that Pollack doesn't take the easy way out and get them into bed shows great retstraint and a powerful sense of human caring as opposed to that other thing.<br /><br />But she was an armed rebel in a foreign country. Her family was murdered by one of the member nations of the United Nations. Do we really think she's going to get a job passing extraordinary scrutiny to be within reaching distance of the 191 most important people in the world?<br /><br />And he's married to a (and I certainly don't mean to denigrate the profession) a stripper, I believe, who finds other men, has passionate affairs with them, leaves Sean and then comes back. Time after time. Over and over. This time, 10-14 days ago, she's in a drunken accident and dies. Now Sean Penn (Tobin Keller) is the guy who guards the President. Do we think he can pass a High School psychological test much less one for the Secret Service?<br /><br />So ill fated people meeting eachother is a good start to a good mystery - thriller. It's just hard to believe it's going to happen in the UN.<br /><br />Kidman gets more beautiful and gifted with each film. Sean Penn is everything Deniro and Pacino had 30 years ago. The guy is great. The two of them carry the movie gratefully beyond the limits of the script. Pollack's film direction is always good. It just seemed as though the movie was in place before the decision was made as to where they wanted the script to take them. 4 stars. Larry Scantleburyts of the script.

B000AL730Y|2.0|This album really isn't a very good effort by McCartney.  The only decent tracks on the CD are \\"Fine Line\\", \\"Friends To Go\\", and, what I think is the best track, \\"English Tea\\", which is really a lovely song.  The other ten tracks are totally forgettable and aren't distinctive at all.  The album is short and appears to have been quickly thrown together.  He has done much better stuff in the past - I usually love his albums - but he misses the mark with Chaos and Creation.

0064471837|5.0|When I first read this book, I was very young. I read it through and thought... \\"man, this is boring...\\" I was used to the violent stories of Abbey mice, the Redwall series. The heavily descriptive paragraphs about the Wall and about Sabriel's schooling totally put me off, and I didn't pick this book back up until about a year ago. I found it on my shelf, thought \\"what the heck?\\" and dove right back in.<br /><br />Instead of finding it incomprehensible and dense as I did when I was younger, I found it engaging and appealing. I read through it at lightning speed, and was full of emotion by the time I had read the last page. The concepts of Charter Magic, Free Magic, and the Bells were unlike anything I had ever heard or read before. The fact that it used marks conjured through drawing through the air repulsed me at first, but as I read on, I saw that it was refreshing from all of this wand-waving and rituals.<br /><br />And the bells...<br /><br />I almost wanted to be the Abhorsen for Halloween (I'm currently 15, I read the books when I was 12-13ish). It boggled my mind that magic could be released through the chimes of bells. It made me want to get some bells and run around my backyard ringing them at anything that moved. But enough of that...<br /><br />You may think that Sabriel is slow-moving, but once you check you're progress by page number, you'll realize you're racing through the pages. The characters are likeable and funny, the plot original and appealing, and the magical aspects refreshing and new.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do.<br /><br />Mark R Guthrie
B000AL730O|5.0|Mccartney's last CD is quite simply a piece of art... Hope he's not saying goodbye with it or pretending to send us a hidden message. I just think it is amazing to listen to what a 63-year old man can do. Sorry for those of you who continue saying Lennon rules... I think, he could have ruled had he been longer with us to prove it... This time, Mccartney is demonstrating, with facts, that he also has something to say to those who have always been detracting him from his achievements.    By the way... though he's denied it, I do seriously think that he's dedicating some lines to Lennon at last in \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\". Obscure song, not his \\"silly-love song\\" style, but definitely a piece of art. Now, it is also possible that this song be dedicated to Michael Jackson... or even to Yoko... Listen to it and make your own conclusions!!!    And also check for the hidden song after \\"Anyway\\" (last track of the cd). Three songs very similar to his music quest in Mccartney, but now completely supported by his experience as a musician. I guess Chris Martin and Bono are really green with envy for not even in their dreams have they come out with such melodies.    As for those waiting for Paul's melodic tunes... they will certainly find them in \\"This Never Happened To Me Before\\"... Would you say the man is still in love? Definitely he knows how to sing about it!!!    Looking for something that reminds you of his Beatles era? Check \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"Fine Line\\"...    What are you waiting for? I'm sure you will listen to this CD and start getting in love with it. A piece of art is not to be kept in stores or at Amazon... Empty their shelves!!!

B00007LTIG|5.0|Grateful Dead (1967). The Grateful Dead's debut LP.<br /><br />By 1967 the Grateful Dead had emerged from the bluegrass scene around San Francisco in the early 1960s, and decided to go electric after hearing bands such as the Rolling Stones. They had been around for about two years and had been under previous names such as the Warlocks and the Emergency Crew. They were signed to Warner Brothers Records in 1966 after Joe Smith, Warner Bros. president, saw them in San Francisco. The band at this time consisted of Jerry Garcia (vocals/lead guitar), Bob Weir (vocals/rhythm guitar) Bill Kreutzmann (drums), Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan (vocals/harp/organ) and Phil Lesh (vocals/bass). This album was released in March 1967, recorded in a marathon time of about 70 hours. The album was very rough and tumble, and only one song hinted torwards the epic jams in their live shows - Viola Lee Blues.<br /><br />To sum it up, this album is a classic. Since it was relesed right before the Summer of Love, it has important historical value as well as what could be the definition of San Fran psych rock. It is the perfect listen for people studying on the San Fran - Haight Ashbury scene of the mid-late 60s. Some of the tracks are drawn from their old jug-band repertoire, and others are just blues covers. But they do a top job on each cover, and come up with some great early band originals. Pigpen, the infamous ruddy blues singer/harp player, knocks the track Good Morning Little School Girl out of the ballpark. Some of the more poppish tracks establish the Dead's reputation for subpar singing- they certainly weren't on the par with other well-known singers of the time. They also cover Morning Dew, a faster version that isn't as great as their later live versions when they slowed the tempo way down.<br /><br />Viola Lee Blues closes the album, and it is stretched to the gills with jamming closing out over 10 minutes, a song length unheard of at the time. But this song points torwards what their live shows were like - playing psychadelic ballrooms and free festivals in San Francisco locales such as Golden Gate Park to thousands.<br /><br />In short, this is a classic album to own, and while it may not be the best Dead album to the newcomer, for the bigger fans and those who revere the San Fran scene, this album is a must own.<br /><br />In 2001, this album got remastered and repackaged along with all the band's offical albums for Warner Brothers records in a box set by Rhino. In 2003, all of those albums got released seperately in the same format as in the box. Each album is pacakged in a digipak with a booklet glued to the back of the front cover filled with recording dates, pictures, promotions supporting the albums, and great liner notes. The CDs replicate the original olive-drabish dark green color of the original vinyl labels. For their debut, a bunch of bonus tracks are included, including a live version of Viola Lee Blues running over 20 minutes, and some studio tracks not placed on the album. Also, a few of the tracks on the album that had to be edited due to vinyl limitations are now restored and run their full length time.their live shows were like - playing psychadelic ballrooms and free festivals in San Francisco locales such as Golden Gate Park to thousands.  <br /> <br />In short, this is a classic album to own, and while it may not be the best Dead album to the newcomer, for the bigger fans and those who revere the San Fran scene, this album is a must own.  <br /> <br />In 2001, this album got remastered and repackaged along with all the band's offical albums for Warner Brothers records in a box set by Rhino.

0380789035|5.0|American God's is Gaiman at his best. Sure he was good in Neverwhere, he entertained us in Stardust, set the comic book world on it's ear in The Sandman but he has never been this good. American Gods is epic - it spans miles and time and depth. It is a story of massive proportions that gets to the basics of what we believe in and why. It is about faith and love and fighting for existence. It is also a discourse on America. Here is this Brit making his observations about America. And he's right on people.<br /><br />I won't get into the plot because I hate to give away too much of books but when you read it, pay attention to the parts where Shadow stays with the two men who run the funeral home. This is probably one of my favorite parts of the book. Ibis and Jacquel are two great characters and Shadow's time at the funeral home is just fantastic. Gaiman is a master character creator. Even when his characters are gods, they are still human enough.<br /><br />American Gods is literature at it's best. Not fantasy but great literature.
B000AL730Y|3.0|After a number of listens to this eagerly awaited new offering from the Mac, the description which best sums up the record for this listener is: \\"Chaos &... is a polished bunch of demos\\"...<br /><br />What I mean is, the thing sounds like a polished batch of demo recordings one hands into the record label, before heading in to the studio with a BAND and cutting the album.<br /><br />Mac certainly can play everything well (his drumming drags however - call a proper drummer next time Paulie please!!!) but he really needs other musicians to play off of and challenge himself,  thereby bringing alittle fire into the proceedings.<br /><br />There are a number of gems here which would have benefitted greatly by having a band (Jenny Wren, Fine Line, Too Much Rain...), the packaging with extra DVD is first rate, but overall the thing sounds unfinished and way, way, way to relaxed.<br /><br />I suppose the record will grow on me over time but for now it's a bit of a dissappointment. Mac might also benefit from working with more of a rock producer next time as well...Rock On Paulie!!

B00005JO0J|5.0|When it comes to writing a genre piece that shouldn't necessarily work, Joss Whedon answers the call. He did it first with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the titular character played by a valley-speaking blonde cheerleader who saved the world more than once. While the transition from movie to TV also caused some shifting in seats, the show became more than a simple cult classic; say the word Buffy, and the words Vampire Slayer are seldom far behind.  <br /> <br />While going the other way (from TV to movies) with a 'space-western,'his prematurely canceled show \\"Firefly,\\" Whedon shows he's able to keep the spirit of the show alive on the big screen, developing a plot that raises the stakes considerably (quieting fears of longtime fans that it would just be a two-hour episode)and somehow leaving the characters much as we left them. The crew of Serenity, led by Capt. Malcom Reynolds, a soldier on the losing side of the massive space war that forced him to a life of crime, is the focus of the film.  <br /> <br />It matters only in a general sense that this film takes place in the outer reaches of space in the future, save its creation of a setting that allows a singular focus on the players involved. The characters are what drive it, and they drive it fast and hard. The plot's pace never slows, even if the space travel sometimes does. There is the obligatory space battle, which should more than satisfy any fan of large explosions and nifty spaceships. But there is also plenty of dialogue, and plenty of moments shared between just a few characters that will elicit laughter (my theater roared at a few particularly clever moments) and tears (for spoilers sake those won't be mentioned here).  <br /> <br />The villain has depth; this deserves mention on its own as it rarely happens. It's not hard to understand why the villain does what he does, and this is a credit to the fair play the writer gives his characters. I hope that the reader understands I'm not shortchanging the actors. While the words are Whedon's, the people he chose to bring these words to life also make the characters the force they are in the film. For a movie like this, those who haven't seen the show will enjoy the show with a fresh look. Those who have, well, they probably don't need a fan like me telling them. <br /> <br />Ah yes, the cat's out of the bag. Given the rating, I doubt many thought I hadn't seen the ill-fated series Firefly. So I touch now upon the touchiest of subjects: will people who haven't seen the show get as much out of the film? I have to say, with a sorrowful heart, no. There is a great deal of backstory between the characters, and while this is made as clear as it can be in the two or so hours that the silver screen shines, it can't compete with 14 episodes (3 unaired) of television to set that up. Here comes the twist (it's a Whedon production, folks. These happen). It doesn't matter. If you haven't seen the show, you don't know what you're missing. And I mean that literally. You can tell that there's a history there when the movie pops up, but the characters are well-developed within the confines of the film. Would you be more comfortable with some of the language if you'd watched the show? Absolutely. Will people who didn't see the show not care about the characters? Doubt it. My wife, who'd never seen the show, laughed at all the right places, and cried with me at all the right places.  <br /> <br />My final grade is high. 5 stars, A, whatever abstraction you want to use. But go see the movie. I couldn't touch on the comparison to other sci-fi movies I've seen recently in the limited space here, but I've seen a lot of them. Serenity gets the nod each and every time.

B0007N1AI6|1.0|You have to give it to JP, they have probably produced their worst album ever.  It makes you wonder where their mainstream audience now lies, because from the composition of most of these tracks on this diabolical album it is pretty obvious that they are targeting adolescent teens.  JP were probably at their biggest in the days of `Unleashed in the East' and `British Steel' because back in the late 70's, their music was basically ahead of many of the NWOBHM outfits emerging at the time and they were `heavy'.  It also seems strange that they continue to write such crap material, when their real audience is probably between the 30-50 age bracket.  If they are targeting 10-13 year olds, then they must realise that Metal outfits like Lacuna Coil & Ramstein are all the rage nowadays, and that these bands' lyrics do not consist of `Deals with the Devil' and `Lochness' but factual themes for the more mature head.  Over all, this is a lousy record and there is not 1 track that stands out.  I could not recommend anybody buying this, but if you do want to listen to the best of this band, I would recommend classic albums like `Sin after Sin', `Killing Machine' and definitely `Unleashed in the East', but this I cannot recommend because it is simply awful and I regret buying it.

0066620996|4.0|As noted by other reviewers, lots of research put into this book. If you work for or with a Fortune 500 company get the book. Consultants will love the book for its wealth of buzz words to make them sound informed or to justify high fees.<br /><br />For the rest of us, sound advice like know your strengths \\"hedgehog...\\" present a blueprint. I not convinced it's the best blueprint; but it's better than none at all.<br /><br />My biggest issue with Good to Great is that it presents companies as one-dimensional and fails to challenge them to raise the benchmarks by which they operate. Profit is paramount. That's what CEOs are there to create. But, what about using corporate responsibility to the community and to the health of its buyers? What about turnover or the commitment to provide a living wage versus a minimum wage? Shouldn't these be mandatory parts of a company's DNA too?<br /><br />I'd like to see more specific application for smaller companies. \\"See chapter 9\\" doesn't cut it. Still, kudos to Jim Collins and his research team. They've got us talking about the need for greatness, and this book is a fair step in the right direction.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|My love for 30STM goes back to an old sampler I got back in 2000 or 2001 with a rough cut of their song \\"Bhudda For Mary\\" from their debut LP. I was hypnotized then by their spacey, atmospheric music. Three years after their debut, and one new guitarist later, the band has returned as more of a band than ever. This time around everyone had input in the creation of the record, unlike their self-titled first effort which was penned mostly by Jared and Shannon. So, how does it really stack up to their other album? Honestly I can't complain much. The guys took a harder edge to their sound and it works very well. \\"The Kill\\" is my favorite song off A Beautiful Lie and the part where Jared screams \\"This is who I really am!\\" just gives me goosebumps. I do miss the more experimental side to their style, but the songwriting is so tight that I'll forgive it. Hopefully on the next go round they'll manage to bring it in a bit more.
B0007MVXQG|3.0|We waited how many years for this?  And this is the best they could do?  If so, then Rob Halford should have remained solo.  As for JP, they seemed finally to find their groove with Ripper Owens and were poised to go in a new and fresh direction.  O.K., so this  album isn't that bad, but considering that both Rob Halford and Priest have spent so much time apart, you would think that they would put out a better album than this.  Anticlimactic is the best way to describe A.O.R.. When taking into account Halford's last solo albums, the unfortunate conclusion I keep coming to is that Judas Priest needed Rob Halford a lot more than he needed them.    Yes, there is some good material here, and yes JP can still rock, but the music here just doesn't seem to reach the same heights reached in Halford's previous work.  The song \\"Lochness\\" pretty much sums up the whole album...I've read somewhere that Rob Halford considered this song as their \\"Lord of the Rings\\" moment.  If that's true then the future dosn't bode well for JP...I mean the music to \\"Lochness\\" is catchy, epic and kind of creepy, but come on!! Listen to the lyrics!  ooh, creepy(yawn), it's a song about the Loch Ness Monster.  This is what Judas Priest has come to...a song about Nessie.      As far as the DVD goes, well once again, Rob Halford is the star of the show.  The overall tone of the DVD is optimistic for the future of the band and the live performances on the disc are impressive.  However, despite Rob Halford's undeniable energy and stage presence, the rest of the band looks...well...kind of old.  It's like watching Blue Oyster Cult in concert.  Yes they can still rock with the best of them, and nobody stays young forever, but just seeing how much these guys have aged is just depressing.  Bottom line?  This album isn't very satisfying, but it is just good enough for me to recommend it if you're a Halford or Judas Priest fan, and it will make you curious as to what the future holds for these reunited metalveterans.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|What can one say about Neil Young? He has gone down the highway in the slow lane, the passing lane and sometimes in the ditch but he always writes what he FEELS. That is what makes him so GREAT. The new album is very touching. I laugh, He was the King, I cry, When God made me, I reflect,This old guitar. There is not a bad song in the lot. Of course there are those that think differently but Neil does what he does and THAT is what makes him who he is. Sure, he's run the gamut of weirdness: TRANS comes to mind, but to me that was really pretty good altho the concert itself was strange. Does one want to relax and reflect on ones life? Then this is the album for you. His voice does crack just a little, but again, he's NEIL YOUNG. Yes I am a HUGE fan 35 plus years I have listened to Neil. Have ALL of his albums/CDs. This one rates at the, if not the, very top of his music. I don't think you'll be disappointed. LONG MAY YOU RUN

B0002SROT0|5.0|When i first bought \\"from a basement on the hill\\" my only previous experience with elliott's work was his self-titled kill rock stars release. needless to say i was shocked. Everything had this gloss over it. It was so detatched. I almost broke down, thinking that someone had butchered the music... <br />In fact, it's simply Elliott progressing and experimenting with new styles, new sounds, new opportunities. and he didn't let any of the time and money that his semi-celebrity status allowed him go to waste. AS much talk as there is about how a rougher production would have served the album well (i tend to agree- just a little more edge, please), getting angry about any aspect of this album is against everything Elliott stood for. This is it-there is nothing else- enjoy it for what it is. That said, what it is is beautiful. Elliott has taken all his experiences and crafted them into a near-seamless series of songs about his typical subjects (drugs, relationships) and given them a newer, even more open canvas for them to be displayed upon. Elliott shows his ability to craft simple songs with emotional heft, and well as unconventional rockers like \\"coast to Coast\\" and \\"King's Crossing\\" where the lyrics combined with the MUSIC have such an emotional heft you want to get up, go out, and crank up ya stereo. There's joy in reckless abandonment here, emphasized by the wall-of-sound techniques with several melodies combining beautifully. Nothing comes out on top, nothing ever collapses, the music exists in perfect balance within itself. and of course, there's always those catchy guitar lines that have you humming \\"Passing Feeling\\" for days on end. I highly recommend this to any music lover. To any Elliott Smith lover. To any multi-instrumentalist who wants to hear how it's done. It's on the edge of something big that's never coming. It's an adrenaline rush composed of back alleys, warm whiskey, cigarettes and conversation. Stop reading my rant and go get it.

0142000663|5.0|john steinbeck belongs to that small group of american writers able to capture a wide array of emotions and issues within a novel.  'the grapes of wrath' is certainly no exception.  some readers may be put off by the book's length, or its decidedly 'okie' dialect. sure, it can be a bit tough to follow sometimes, but a couple dozen pages into the novel it's not too difficult to pick up on the dialect. and the book is quite simple to read and follow. it takes a master to keep is simple, yet profound.<br /><br />in 'the grapes of wrath' steinbeck once again proves he's the master of the moral dilemma--yet he doesn't dare presume to offer any answers. he puts his characters in situations and lets them succeed or fail (and they often do fail). it's one of the beauties of steinbeck's writing.  while we tend to pull for his characters, we know they're as deeply flawed as they are--and perhaps that's why do we care as much as we do.<br /><br />the novel opens with tom joad jr's release from prison for homicide, continues through the joad's departure to california and their ultimate arrival in california and all the accompanying trouble.  steinbeck, perhaps better than anyone before or since, captures the essence of america. what does it mean to be an american? what did it mean to be an american during the depression? how do we, as americans, treat our fellow citizens? what are our rights and obligations as citizens of this great country? as i mentioned earlier, steinbeck offers no answers--but eloquently poses the questions (as any good literature worth its salt will do).  in many ways the joads are the quintessential american family, warts and all.<br /><br />what surprised me most, however, about 'the grapes of wrath' is that it's very much a story about matriarchy and the power of women.  ma joad is one of the strongest women i've read about in literature. her's are the most heartbreaking scenes (when they're stopped at the border; when rose of sharon gives birth; when tom jr repeats his crime), yet she always comes out stronger and wiser. it's ma joad who herds the family. it's ma joad who looks after the men in her family. it's ma joad who understands why her husband and children behave the way they do. she's literally the glue that keeps the family together.  i applaud steinbeck for writing such a profoundly wonderful, complex, and postive female character during a time when a lot of writers seemed to treat women as afterthoughts (hemingway?).<br /><br />there's much to admire in steinbeck's writing. as a writer, he's nearly unmatched. as a social commentator, he's peerless. as an advocate for the underpriviledged, displanced, and desperate, he's the master., yet she always comes out stronger and wiser. it's ma joad who herds the family. it's ma joad who looks after the men in her family. it's ma joad who understands why her husband and children behave the way they do. she's literally the glue that keeps the family together.  i applaud steinbeck for writing such a profoundly wonderful, complex, and postive female character during a time when a lot of writers seemed to treat women as afterthoughts (hemingway?).     there's much to admire in steinbeck's writing. as a writer, he's nearly unmatched. as a social commentator, he's peerless. as an advocate for the underpriviledged, displanced, and desperate, he's the master.
B000002LND|5.0|Exhausting yourself in Madonna's sometimes overanalyzed career can take a lot more time than just simply slipping in this collection of her best work to date and singing along to all her hits. Every aspect of her chameleon like persona is covered with a few extras thrown in you forgot about. An added bonus to the mix, is fresh new songs that prove how sexy Madonna really can be. <br /> <br />Definitely a must for any pop music lover!
B000A2XC1C|4.0|When this film came out 20 years ago it was really hailed for it's special effects and technical achievments.  Remember this was before CGI and the use of computer generated special effects was in its infancy.  The achievement of getting Santa Claus and his reindeer and sleigh to fly was truly masterful.  Not coincidently the film was produced by Ilya Salkind who produced the Superman Films and brought along some of the men who did the effects on the Superman films.  Besides the flying sequences, the creation of the North Pole was the most elaborate ever seen on film up to that point, and possibly ever.<br /><br />The movie begins in the past showing how The David Huddleston character eventually becomes Santa Claus.  Huddleston makes for a truly striking Santa Claus, certainly one of the very best ever seen on screen.  The film then jumps forward to modern day and loses a bit of steam.  As Patch the Elf, Dudley Moore leaves the North Pole to head to the big city where the naive elf falls under the influence of ruthless corporate toy manafacturer B.Z. played by John Lithgow.  This was one in a long line of villain roles the he would play in the late 80's and early 90's.  Some people thinks he steals the show as a modern day Scrooge but to me he just chews up a bit too much scenery and takes some of the heart out of the film.  That aside it's really a well done film, perhaps a bit dated but still good enough to be an annual holiday treat.

B000000WA2|5.0|The Great Escape is, in my humble opinion, the best and most underrated pop album of the 90's. It is an album where each song doesn't necessarily flow together and yet to the listener, it feels like the album created a world. In that world are characters that are pretty bummed out. Damon Albarn sympathizes with these characters, it's as if he makes fun of them and becomes friends with them at the same time. He narrates what they do, but understands why they do them. He treats them as if they just took the wrong path by mistake and now they're paying for it. But what I love most about The Great Escape is how diverse the themes are. This album has everything: humor (\\"Mr. Robinson's Quango\\", \\"Dan Abnormal\\"), wit (\\"Charmless Man\\", \\"Top Man\\"), optimism (\\"Could Be You\\"), pessimism (\\"Fade Away\\", \\"He Thought of Cars\\"), fantasy (\\"The Universal\\"), and desperation (\\"Entertain Me\\", a perfect gem and Blur's crowning achievement). The songs are tight and structured; there's nothing indulgent about The Great Escape. The real true great escape of the album is the final minute of carnival music at the end. It's as if Dan Abnomal, Ernold Same, and Mr. Robinson (and everybody else) actually decided on going to a carnival and forget about their problems for a day. If you love this album the way I do, it will probably make you watery-eyed.<br />  Rarely ever have songs so simple sounded so profound. The Great Escape is Blur's Revolver, a wide-ranging and stunning masterpiece that should be considered vital.

0156027321|4.0|'Life of Pi' can mainly be seen as a two-part book. Part 1 is mostly written in the now while Part 2 deals with a 227 day trip after a shipwreck. Pi survives in a boat with some animals, his father had a zoo in India, but after a while only survives with a tiger. <br /> <br />If everything has really happened is up for debate. when he arrives in Mexico he is interrogated by the Japanese people who owned the ship and some other facts surface. However, they find the story so incredible and amazing that they stick with that version. <br /> <br />And so do I, it's a great story. Sometimes it has the feel of 'the old man and the sea', sometimes of all the books you read about shipwrecks. The writing is very clear and therefor it won't take you long to read. You will keep reading anyway.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'd never heard about it until right before Serenity, the motion picture, came out.  So I bought it thinking it'd be entertaining, and now I'm left to wonder how in the world this show got canceled.  It's like getting someone addicted to crack, then taking it away.  I really wanted to know how everything turned out.  The movie explained a lot, but I still can only hope that there will be a series continuation.<br /><br />Buy this and watch it!!!!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Sound and vision of the DVD is fantastic. EC proves he is the best blues guitarplayer in the world. Jack and Ginger are still a driving force.  <br />Favourites: Too many but stands out: Spoonful, Storming Monday, Sleepy time, we'r going wrong. <br />
B0009WFFS6|4.0|The quality of this DVD is top notch... that is certain.  I think most of the reviewers here would recommend it to any audiophile.  Aside from that, all the \\"I saw them live,\\" \\"I'm going to see them live,\\" or \\"I wont see them live or the dvd because they didnt play my favorite songs\\" are nice- but hardly important.   <br />  Many of the reviews here, unfortunately, are all about comparing the band today to something from almost 4 decades go.  Yes, clearly, they're not exactly like the live Cream from the 60's... some things are \\"better,\\" and certainly some things are not... yet, overall, I would say cream is like anything we enjoy that ages. Like wine, Scotch, cheese, and coffee, some like them bright, loud and uncomplicated... others prefer the smooth subtleties that come out in years.  I love the live cream from the 60's but I will not let that prejudice take away from the 40 years of joy and pain since, that Clapton has gloriously transformed into the blues power he plays today.  \\"Slowhand,\\" now, has traded in the Les Paul for a Strat and turned town the volume a bit... it's different, but its still as amazing as ever.  For better or for worse-- I am grateful that the band risked the harsh criticisms we've read, just to give us all a chance to hear something most of us only dreamed about.  <br />If you like, there are a thousand and one bands out there today that are as just loud as cream was and twice as heavy... feel free to buy their DVD's if thats all you're looking for... because in 2005 Clapton and Company are as smooth and mellow as any vintage- \\"less is more\\"- jazz trio- take it or leave it... but definately check it out.
0805076476|4.0|i thought this was a very vivid and descriptive book. Chuck Palaniuk used very morbid and twisted situations which appeal to many. I have seen the movie but i like the book more because of its very descriptive intoduction. This book captures fighting in a way not of anger, but for men to just let everything out that built up over their week.Chuck describes his scenes so well it made me fell like i was part of the fight club. This was the main reason why i would recommend this book to any one that isn't afrad to read about a little morbid and twisted violence.i wasn't much of a reader because books dont really capture me until i read this one. i rate this an 9 out of 10, the only reason it doesnt get 10 out of 10 is because i didn't really liked how much he jumped around throught out the beggining of the novel. Overall i enjoyed this book very much and im excited to read more of Chuck's novels.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Witness the proliferation of Special Edition/Director's Cuts that didn't make the mark:  E.T., Star Wars, The Disney Pecos Bill cartoon where the filmmakers saw fit to alter the film in some way that in essence, ruined it.<br /><br />The Director's Cut of The Warriors falls closer to that end of the spectrum occupied by the \\"Deckard is a Replicant\\" version of Blade Runner and Apocalypse Now Redux as the rare bird that improves upon the original.<br /><br />The previously comic bookesque wipes are enhanced by scene changes taking place within panels of a comic book, further cementing the aura.  Considering the film's allegorical nature of the story of the stranded Greek warriors, it's like an updated Classics Illustrated that is updated even further.<br /><br />Come for the updates to the film but stay for the bonus materials, including interviews with the well-preserved Cochise, Ajax, and Mercy, and the not-so-well preserved Luther and Swan.

B00005O3VC|4.0|When I was a teenager, I looked at the few infomercials stating the Monty Python series on VHS and DVD, I thought the series was just filler. But later, as I grew older, some of my relatives introduced me to one of its films--The Holy Grail. Through that hour-and-a-half I was laughing so hard at everything the movie represented. And as time wore, I was watching the TV series itself, and that show was actually a little better than what I expected.<br /><br />Now appreciating the entire franchise itself, I managed to pick up the Holy Grail movie itself on a 2-disc Special Edition DVD for $14 at a locat Target store and I was freaking happy.<br /><br />What exactly is the movie about? Well, this is the retelling of the story of King Arthur, his uniting with the Knights of the Round Table at Camelot, and of course, the search for the Holy Grail--all told in a British humor fashion. Pointless, you may say, but still funny as hell nonetheless. And what a funny crew of Knights of Camelot, too; we have: Arthur, King of the Britons, Sir Bedevere the Wise (I think), Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Gallahad the Pure, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot. When a new strategy was planned along the way though, the Knights split up and went seperate ways to find the Grail, and that's when the comedy ensues. You'll see Sir Robin meet a giant three-headed knight whose three heads bicker at each other; Sir Gallahad run into a castle filled with sex-driven maidens; Sir Lancelot try to rescue a princess locked in a castle only to find out it's really a wussy prince trying to escape from being forced by his father to marry someone in favor of the bride's landscape; and King Arthur and Sir Bedevere meet the Knights who say \\"Ni!\\" that order the two to find a shrubbery with their necks at stake. In addition you'll find the entire crew meet up a castle full of disrespectful French and a certain rabbit...<br /><br />Now on to the DVD itself. The video quality here has been remastered, but not restored; the picture is still grainy and muddy, but the colors are bright and solid nonetheless. The audio  quality could've been better, though. Although we do get a Dolby Mono soundtrack, it's pretty muffled, just like in the VHS copy. The Dolby 5.1 track, though, is much clearer than the mono, but doesn't thump the entire house-a good track anyway.<br /><br />As with the extras, there's plenty to keep you happy. The first disc contains two fun commentary tracks by the Pythonites themselves and a Pop-up video track for storyboard comparisons.<br />Also included are subtitles \\"for people who don't like the film\\". There's also an extra 24 seconds added in the film...<br /><br />Disc Two carries the bulk of the extras. For starters, we have two fun featurettes: \\"The Quest For the Holy Grail Locations\\" where Terry Jones and Michael Palin show which landscapes were the entire movie shot; and \\"How to use your Coconuts\\", an interesting feature on how to carve your coconut to a point where you can start banging them to make a trotting horse sound.<br />Also there's an interesting newscast featurette called \\"On Location with the Pythons\\", where the BBC News crew talks to the Python crew about the making of the film. In addition you'll also get art and photo galleries, it's theatrical trailer, Three Sing-alongs from the film, and a few more pointless features for the Python fan.<br /><br />In conclusion, I still like the film as much as the DVD treatment here. And I appreciate the show itself,too. So buy this film and enjoy this film...<br /><br />YOU DAFFY ENGLISH...KUH-NIGGETS.
B000A0GYD2|4.0|From the Earth to the Moon: Signature Edition (2005)<br /><br />I don't intend to review the content of this DVD set as it has been covered in great detail by many hundreds already. If you love top-class historical drama and enjoyed Apollo 13, you probably know about the quality of this miniseries already. My rating for the miniseries itself is 9.5 out of 10.<br /><br />This is a short review to point out the differences between the 2000 4-Disc box set and the 2005 Signature Edition 5-disc box set.<br /><br />In case you have already got the 2000 DVD set in your collection and are wondering whether to update it to the 2005 edition, here are the differences:<br /><br />Firstly, there are 5 discs instead of 4, but NO difference in content. No extra scenes, documentaries or commentary. The original DVD-Rom Disc 4 has been re-authored to play on your DVD player in the lounge room. This makes a lot of the content immediately accessible instead of having to search for it on the net, but the interactivity is gone. For me that's small loss as I didn't get much out of the games etc anyway.<br /><br />Secondly, the entire set has been remastered in DTS and Widescreen (1.85:1). Now this sounds like manna from heaven, but unfortunately only the audio remastering is really worth spending any extra dollars on. The sound is crisp, clear and beautifully mixed and the liftoffs etc come booming out of your home theatre system like you were there at the Cape.<br /><br />But the widescreen - well, sadly it just doesn't enhance the original viewing experience. It's evident that HBO produced the original series in 1.33:1 for tv and have merely re-jigged and adapted that ratio for the modern proliferation of widescreen plasma television sets. There is no extra data. You will find some scenes are better cut in the frame, but others suffer. For example, in Disc 1, when the Gemini 8/Agena assembly is tumbling around the sky with a stuck thruster, you don't see the thruster in the new widescreen version as it is cut off by the top of the frame. Some captions have also been compromised.<br /><br />As the series was created for the 1.33:1 ratio, all the crucial information is positioned inside the frame for that ratio anyway. The only advantage of the widescreen ratio is that it now fits your new plasma widescreen without the black bars. Also the video quality is not as crisp as I expected it to be, possibly from the re-sizing process.<br /><br />Each chapter now gets its own play and audio options menu and there are 3 chapters per disc, which is tidier. However there are still those weird groupings of episodes where some contain the titles and some don't. Nothing has changed here.<br /><br />The box looks impressive with the silver signature cover and Tom's moniker on it and there is a nice holo of the Earth and the Moon which alternates as you tilt it this way and that.<br /><br />But, in a major disappointment to this buyer, the original cardboard foldout format is identical to its 2000 counterpart. My box broke apart after about a year due to excessive wear and tear and sadly I fear this box will succumb to the same fate. Two of my discs had already broken free from their moorings in transit and were sliding all round the inside of the box, picking up scratches and marks in the process. Poor packaging.<br /><br />How I wish they'd used the Battlestar Galactica Season 1 format where all discs sit securely in plastic pages like the leaves of a book. Sturdier, simpler and more durable.<br /><br />In summary, if you don't have From the Earth to the Moon, then buy this 2005 set. If you have it already and are wondering whether to spend $100 on a better version, think twice. You may think it's worth it to get better sound, but unless you are an audiophile with a top home theater surround system and DTS, you probably won't notice. You may be better off spending your money on other titles.
B0009X766Y|5.0|The Sting is unquestionably one of the great films of cinema and one of the most entertaining. Winning seven Academy Awards in 1973 (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Original Song Score, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design), it was the second great Newman and Redford pairing (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid being the first in 1969). Both films start out with top notch scripts, both were directed by George Roy Hill, and both did well at the box office (Butch Cassidy being top grosser in '69).<br /><br />If you don't know what the film is about, it's a con. Set in the thirties, and brimming over with wonderful Scott Joplin ragtime tunes, it has a light, playful feel that is likeable on every level. When Hooker (Redford) loses his small-town grifting partner to a Chicago syndicate hit, he enlists the help of Chicago con man Gondorf (Newman) to help him get revenge on the syndicate's boss, Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). First they take his money in what has to be one of the best card games in cinema, and, in my opinion, the best scene in the movie. Newman is classic as an obnoxiously drunk, arrogant card shark, and Redford is equally good as his vulnerable errand boy. After that, they continue to lead Lonnegan down the rosy path and into their trap, with the help of a host of wonderful characters played by some of the greatest character actors of the period.<br /><br />One of the most wonderful things about this film is that, not only is Lonnegan conned by the end of the movie - so are we! The writer, David Ward, did such a good job layering the plot, and giving it so many twists and turns, that we are as unaware as Shaw's character that we are being had. It really is a marvelous piece of entertainment.<br /><br />As far as the controversial Universal Legacy Series DVD, I have watched the new, widescreen version and the old, full-screen version side-by-side, and can tell you unequivocally that the widescreen version WAS INDEED made from the full-screen version, as some have asserted. In other words, black bands WERE added to the top and bottom of the full-screen version to create the widescreen version. For this reason, Universal has reissued the original full screen version.<br /><br />There is also a difference in color between the two versions. While the picture of the earlier, full-screen version is not nearly as good as the new widescreen, the widescreen has been pushed too far to the cyan side of the color scale, so that it has a definite blue-green tint. You may not notice it when watching the widescreen by itself; but if you watch the two versions together, you'll see it. Also, the sound is considerably lower in volume on the widescreen version, and seems less full-bodied than other DVD's. I could be wrong about that, but that's the way it seems on my system.<br /><br />As far as the extra features on the second disc, they contain many memories of the production and great tributes paid to Hill by the actors, along with writer David Ward. Ward is especially interesting as he discusses how he was drawn to write a script about confidence men and how he structured the film, balancing the mechanics of conning Lonnegan with conning us. So, all in all, the second, widescreen DVD has some improvements over the previous DVD, plus the extras; but, if you want to see the film the way it was released in theatres back in 1973, watch the first version or the new reissue.<br /><br />Waitsel Smitheen version, as some have asserted.

B0006L16N8|1.0|Coldplay is so overhyped it's not even funny. All there songs sound the same. From the annoying song yellow to now the new cd which I have listened to because my dad wasted his money on buying this cd. If you are looking for some good music to listen to Keane would be a good choice as well as Gavin Degraw people who can actually sing and actually don't hurt your ears while singing the same redundant songs over and over again. Note to Chris Martin you're never going to be as big as U2. Never ever. No talent=gone soon.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|I'll be dating myself, but the first concert I ever attended was Cream during their 1968 farewell tour.  I loved the band then and was ecstatic when word came out about this DVD.  I bought and viewed it yesterday and offer the following comments: <br /> <br />1.  This should have been called \\"Eric Clapton's Cream\\".  From the outset, EC is clearly in charge of the proceedings. <br /> <br />2.  Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker shouldn't have skipped their sessions with the make-up artist.  They look pretty awful (although at age 62 and 65 respectively, they probably have a right to).  Unfortunately, they don't generate much energy on stage, either.  To me, they came across more as session men then Clapton's bandmates. <br /> <br />3.  Clapton is God, Circa 2005:  Eric's playing is the real highlight here, magnificent from start to finish.  Alternately lyrical and powerful, he get in plenty of gutsy blues licks as well as some tasteful psychedelic flourishes (befitting a band together from 1966-68).  Clapton seemed totally at ease and energized by the prospect of playing with his former bandmates.  Hearing him perform unadorned by the layers of backing guitars so prevalent on his studio recordings is a genuine treat and (for me at least) a reminder of why he is a rock legend. <br /> <br />4.  Who picked this playlist?  While most of their hits are represented (\\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" and \\"Strange Brew\\" were sadly absent), why include marginal items like \\"We're Going Wrong\\" and \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\"?  There's even a cover of \\"Stormy Monday\\", a standard already beaten into the ground by countless other bands. <br /> <br />5.  What now?   I suggest you buy the companion CD instead.  I was elated to discover that Cream still has something to say musically after all this time.  However, watching a bunch of old geezers compete to see who will be the first to collapse from exhaustion on stage is best left to hard core pain addicts.
0880796863|5.0|Shame on the reviewer who cannot appreciate the beauty of this deck. These images are the original archetypes that would cause such a dramatic interest in this rather obscure means of \\"fortune telling\\". It is true the images are not vibrant and colorful. The Universal Waite deck came nearly a century later and lovingly pays tribute to these original images. Many other \\"clones\\" would follow with various intrepretations/colorations. The basic images remain a constant. <br /> <br />This was the first set of images I was exposed to years ago and have grown to love over time. They have mystery and depth to them which must be experienced first hand. All modern standards come from this set. The backs are the best intrepretation I have ever seen. Much better then the busy lines that most see. The soft colors with their tan tone is soothing to the eye. While not an \\"absolute\\" original reprint of the deck, I feel this is the closest one can get!
B0002XDODU|5.0|This album is one of the darkest from Rammstein, but also one of the best I have ever heard.  I love every song on the album, although it took me a long time to not feel sick when listening to the text of \\"Mein Teil\\".  How beautifully written, but so gross.  I still love listening to it.  Since I am fluent in German, there isn't a song here I didn't understand, and I am frankly thrilled and astonished at the beauty and poetry of the German in this album.  Till's clear, concise German is one of the delights of listening to Rammstein.  I especially liked the song about the flight, the haunting chorus, the lyrics, the words, even the ending, where the child dies because he is crushed by his father out of sheer fright.  I also liked the contrast of \\"Amerika\\" to \\"Moskau\\" --  America with its wonderbra and Micky Mouse and Moscow as an old but still seductive prostitute.  Finally, the last song, comparing love to a wild animal was very meaningful for me.  Yes, definitely one of the best from Rammstein and I play it often especially on my German car's CD Player.  Rammstein, wirklich toll.

I keep hearing \\"FF stick to what worked for them on their first album...\\", \\"More of the same...\\", \\"Still the same kind of rock music...\\" <br /> <br />I think it's pretty clear that this album is a far more raw and truthful album than their debut. I found most of the songs on their debut, while quite good, didn't hold up well over time. I barely even listen to 'FF' anymore. The songs seemed tailored for some kind of commercial mass market appeal. Not the case with 'You Could Have It So Much Better...' <br /> <br />I was at the Franz show here in Chicago on September 20th (the show that launched their new US tour), and they performed a lot of these new songs. I remember reading that the band wanted this album to give the listener a better idea of what it's actually like to hear them in concert, live. I think they definitely succeeded. They seem to have successfully captured the energy of that experience on this studio album. <br /> <br />These songs have an honesty and originality about them which was lost on their debut, maybe because now that they have a solid fan base, and they feel they don't need to \\"establish\\" themselves at this point. The music sounds like it's right in your face, like you can almost reach out and touch Mr Kapranos and the gang. The tendency toward pretty but hollow melodies and simplistic lyrics is absent on FF's sophomore release. Instead, they're playing music for the MUSIC. As it should be. Highly recommended.
B0006284JQ|2.0|<br />You get a bonus star Britney!!!!! <br /> <br />Normally I give singers who don't write lyrics one star, but toxic is one of the best radio hits of the decade -- bonus star!! Its seriously creative and catchy material  - and if Britney wasn't so unintelligent i'd say that she sounds cleverly sarcastic on the song (wonder who wrote it). <br /> <br />Britney is obviously a girl that most people, with good reason, want to fall flat on her face.  So has it happened yet? Sort of.  Its too easy to hate on her now.  Its almost lost its fun.  And thats really the most unfortunate aspect of all this. <br /> <br />
B0001AP12G|4.0|I really enjoy this cd. Kanye has fun lyrics and I love  <br />Jesus Walks it is worth buying the cd for! There is a lot of <br />bad language and that is it's only downfall.
B000A88F22|5.0|All I can say is if you like Britney, you'll like this DVD. If you don't, then stay away. <br />All right, I am a true Britney fan. And I am even more of one after seeing this. It shows her as the uninhibited free spirit that she is,and the nice, down-to-earth person too. And Kevin is a lot brighter than his detractors like to admit. <br />Good footage of their travel, of course would have liked more concert footage,naturally. <br />As I say, not for the prudes,or those who hold the values of the Moral Majority. But for those of us who still cherish the values of \\"Hair\\" and Woodstock,its all right. <br />Hadnt really planned to write a  review, but after seeing some of the vicious comments some were making, had to let my voice be heard. <br />Its a lot of fun, and every true Britney fan should own it.
B00005JMCW|1.0|I knew from the previews this was gonna be dumb. I didn't want to see it, but I was forced to in band class (amazing what bad movies you see in band class...)<br /><br />The big draw of this movie is how a teenage girl switches with her mom. The big problem is the bad chemistry between whatever sucker played the teenager and her mom. The two don't go together well, and the most emotional moments seem so forced...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and it's painfully unfunny, the concept is pretty stale, and let's not forget how stupid the title is.
B000001FN3|5.0|I love the CD's!!! Wonderful take on Edgar Allan Poe.  I heard some music done by some older artists a long time ago and this one tops it!!!!! <br />Wonderful CD, wonderful purchase altogether.  I would recommend this product to my friends and anyone interested in Edgar Allan Poe or the Alan Parsons Project.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I usually say this is my favorite Stones album...unless I'm in a different mood it will be Beggar's Banquet. Fantastic album all around. Another must own. The boys during their peak period. The studio version of Midnight Rambler still blows me away just like it did when this album was first released. The live version on Ya-Yas never cut if for me. This song is filled with such menace. Worth the price of the CD alone. Get it!
0064400018|5.0|I loved all the Little House books as a child, but when my son at 6 years old began requesting chapter books for bedtime stories, I didn't choose one right off. It had been years since I had read Little House in the Big Woods and thought it might be \\"too girly.\\" Not so! It is by far the most appropriate book we've read so far in its reading/understanding level, lenghth of chapters and inclusion of first-person stories, and its use of illustrations. And, my goodness, between the hunting and the spooky woods tales, my son is loving it. He even liked it that Laura got her doll for Christmas. All in all, this book is fabulous for reading to children, and then for them to read themselves. Her second book, Farmer Boy, was the first novel I read, when I was in second grade. I can't decide whether to read that to him or let him discover it on his own when he is solidly reading himself ... .
B00006AW2M|3.0|If this was the Stones answer to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper, then they failed miserably. A few excellent songs. 2000 Light Years From Home, She's Like a Rainbow, 2000 Man...and the suprise of the album, Bill Wyman's \\"In Another Land.\\"  Even stoned I can't get into it. As for the Sgt. Pepper comparison...Brian Wilson's \\"Smile\\" is 2000 light years ahead of both groups!
6302180163|5.0|\\"The Bride Wore Black\\" is not your typical French film. It keeps your attention throughout the whole film. I have never come across something quite like it. <br /> <br />     The film is centered around a woman, who is seeking to kill five men. When the film commences, you have no idea exactly why she is doing this. Through her clever tactics, she manages to kill them all. <br /> <br />     As the film progresses you understand each piece of the puzzle, and by the end, the puzzle fits together, and you learn exactly why the film is called \\"The Bride Wore Black\\" and why she needed to get her revenge.
B000000W5H|2.0|Another from their first mediocre period. I'll be brief again. Good songs: Dance Little Sister, It's Only Rock N Roll. Not quite good enough: If You Can't Rock Me, Ain't Too Proud to Beg. Forget the rest. I speak the truth.
B00005JO0J|5.0|This is surprising considering the plot of Serenity is a gritty outlaw western, set in a science fiction genre.  But the reason why 4 out of 5 movie critics gives it a thumbs up ([...]) is the acting, cast chemistry, how much you as the audience come to care about the characters, even if you haven't seen them before, and the fact that it is a classic tale retold with twists that point out the glaring clich&eacute;s in other films and make you laugh.  My how you laugh.  And maybe cry too.<br /><br />Like I said, you find yourself pulling for the crew of the Serenity.  They are the underdogs.  The outcasts.  These are not the beautiful people.  These are the people you generally pass in the streets and hope to ignore.  These are the lower class trying to make a living on the frontier.  This is their story.  And like truth, they do not fare well.<br /><br />It is also a story about a fundamental reality, that there are two kinds of people in the universe: Those who wish to be left alone, and those who won't leave them alone.  And that those who won't leave them alone are almost always the winners.  That the world almost always belongs to those who wish to be left alone because they struggle to make the land livable, but their property is always taken by those who follow.<br /><br />Serenity, the movie is an struggling underdog too.  It  is a shame that like the crew of Serenity, this film isn't faring well.  It is playing to mostly empty theater seats.  And that is a shame, because it means you will miss your chance to see a good yarn.  That is a rare thing coming from Hollywood, as we experienced this summer with every tired, warmed over sequel, remake, and hack television drivel.  Yes, Serenity is based upon a failed TV series.  But it was not a hack plot.  It was a fresh perspective, that got a major motion picture studio to spend $40 million to bring the tale to the big screen.  If you want to see a good movie for once, you had best hurry, because sadly, even with the very good reviews, Serenity won't be around much longer.<br /><br />Would I say this is a must see?  No.  Would I say this was a B+ should see.  Absolutely.  Good movie to take a date, because there is plenty to keep your girl shedding tears while you watch the action.<br /><br />(...)Serenity won't be around much longer.

B00006AW2J|5.0|I can't decide if this is my favorite Stones album or my second favorite. Mick and Keef really knew how to write songs back then.<br /><br />An absolute must have album. THIS is the boys at their peak, NOT Exile on Mainstreet...which I like too, by the way.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I do not speak spanish, nor have I ever owned any Shakira , and I am thoroughly obsessed with this album. It has not left my CD player in about a month. Allthough there is a language barrier for me, I feel this album through and through.Call me crazy but, I highly reccomend it.IT IS BEAUTIFUL!!!
B000000W5B|2.0|I'll get to the point on this one. The only decent songs are Angie, Heartbreaker, and Star Star. The rest are really bad. Trust me.
B00005JO0J|5.0|This movie exceeded every expectation I had.<br /><br />I got into the series after it was cancelled and I'm glad I did since I would have gone ballistic when the morons at FOX cancelled it. When I bought the DVD set I knew it was limited and therefor enjoyed it the more knowing it was as scarce as a rare jewel.<br /><br />Serenity as a film succeeds in the way that most space-operas fail: character development. In so many space opera characters are virtually interchangable and few have anything that really sets them apart. Serenity and Firefly revels in the characterizations and plays on the differences to make the whole better and stronger.<br /><br />I have read several professional reviews that opined that Serenity was better cast, written and performed than any of the last 3 Star Wars episodes. On this I heartily agree. Serenity makes the Star Wars look like as superficial as a Japanime cartoon in comparison.<br /><br />Dialog is fast and witty. Spec-effects are on par with the best of the best ( and probably done for a fraction of the cost of others) and Whedon's writing and directing make this a personal film with a strong libertarian streak throughout.<br /><br />The Firefly/Serenity universe is probably realistic for the time imagined -  +500 years. No aliens, no transporter beams, but  strong and pervasive internet ( the Cortex ), and above all practicality.<br /><br />You can see the future here and believe it.<br /><br />For those of you not familiar with the Firefly/Serenity universe, it may seem odd at first - old western. But logic it out. It makes sense. The Allinace terraforms \\"dozens of planets and hundreds of moons\\" populates them and leaves them to their own devices except when it's tax time. Most are forced into a agrarian economic base and a technology equivalent to the mid 1800's.<br /><br />Anyway way it doesn't matter all that much anyway because the plot doesn't depend on laser battles and weird aliens. It's about people and their yearning for freedom and our hope that 500 years is not enough time to stamp out the love of freedom no matter how powerful the Alliance or the Fed become and that individuals can triumph and live their own lives.<br /><br />Serenity is easily on par with the new Battlestar Galactica which according to Wired magazine is the \\"best show on television\\".<br /><br />Lets all hope that the success of this film will revive the series or at the very least lead to second movie.their yearning for freedom and our hope that 500 years is not enough time to stamp out the love of freedom no matter how powerful the Alliance or the Fed become and that individuals can triumph and live their own lives. <br /> <br />Serenity is easily on par with the new Battlestar Galactica which according to Wired magazine is the \\"best show on television\\". <br /> <br />Lets all hope that the success of this film will revive the series or at the very least lead to second movie.
B00064MW6K|2.0|The first thing i found was wrong with this movie was that Catwaomen's real name was Selena Kyle and in this movies its Patience Phillips. The Story is completly wrong, Catwomen is not as goood as they portray her in this movie. the only bad she does is stael stuff she gives back. And where is Gotham, where is batman, where is Bruce Wayne? If you want to see a movies about the real Catwoman see Batman Returns.

B000002J03|5.0|As far as rock music goes, if 'Whole Lotta Love' doesn't do it for you, maybe you should give up and become a monk or nun or something, because you're never going to find a song so full of life, energy and wild abandon (and maybe just a little sleaze) again. In fact Led Zeppelin start out there second album so strong the rest is almost a dissapointment in comparison. Almost I said because the rest is pretty d**n rocking too.  <br /> <br />Whether it's descening into unhinged freak outs, like on 'The Lemon Song' or ploughing forward with straight a head rockers like 'Heartbreaker' or even flickering from gentle to blistering and back, 'Ramble On', Led Zeppelin II never lets up being a full on rock and roll experience. Words never do music justice, but for Led Zeppelin they do even begin. Unless you're listening to the album blare out of you stereo speakers with the volume turned up loud enough to shake the whole house you just won't understand.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|What a letdown.  We got the gang together in anticipation of a monumental event.  Instead, we were outraged with the inclusion of a corny intro, bad comic book panel transitions, and an alteration of the classic end shot.  As others have stated, you don't mess with the classics!
B000002J09|5.0|If you just want a sheer good rock and roll time its hard to go past Led Zeppelin's fourth album. Something happens when the funky opening riff to 'Black Dog' kicks, you just start to feel better. Maybe it is over the top and bombastic, but thank god for that because rock music what be boring as hell if it was all restrained and earnest. And just about all of IV is grooving, stomping, rocking fun. Its just about impossible to pick the best Led Zeppelin album (its usually between this one, Houses Of The Holy and Physical Graffitti for me) but this ones pretty certain to come into consideration.  <br /> <br />Can anyone really image a world with no 'Stairway To Heaven'? Is there any moment in rock history that can really compete with that glorious one when John Bonham's thunderous drums split open THAT Jimmy Page guitar solo, for the essence of what rock and roll really is? A couple maybe depending, and one of thems probably in 'When The Levee Breaks' when, Page's guitar briefly hangs alone for a moment before the harmonica wails, the drums drop in and Robert Plant lets loose a wail of his own, how can you not love it?  <br /> <br />The rest, well you've got the most gentle relaxed tones on 'The Battle Of Evermore' and 'Going To California. 'Black Dog' is a funky hard rocker as mentioned before.  'Rock And Roll' just is, and so are 'Misty Mountain Hop' and 'Four Sticks'. If you love rock and roll in all its shapes and forms you've got love Led Zeppelin, at least some of the time.
B0000029GA|5.0|I heard most of this in 94' when it was released, but I didn't purchase it until the fall of 97'. After hearing the album in its entirety I thought it was an instant classic, but I still didn't think it was worthy of all the critical acclaim that it received. Back in 94', I thought that almost everything coming out of the East and West Coast was classic or close to it, so it was hard for me to make the distinction. In fact, I thought Common Sense's \\"Resurrection\\" and Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth's \\"The Main Ingredient\\" were better. It wasn't until I went back and listened to Rakim's older albums that I began to appreciate \\"Illmatic\\". I say this because to me, Nas sounded like the second coming of Rakim on \\"Illmatic\\". As my musical tastes matured, this album became a masterpiece and as of yet, it is the best hip-hop album ever, IMO.  <br /> <br />Favorites: <br /> <br />N.Y. State Of Mind <br />The World Is Yours <br />Halftime <br />Memory Lane

B00006IUL7|2.0|It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging. See the film for their far-too-short performances, but make sure you rent it, and don't pay too much to do so.
B0002NRRAG|1.0|It took her 8 years to come up with this? This is a great collection of songs, but she manages to wring all the life out of them with her shallow, expressionless vocal stylings. It's a good thing she's not a doctor. <br /> <br />The arrangment on Between The Bars is fantastic - I would pay good money to hear just about any other singer cover it.  <br /> <br />This album is coma inducing. If Dionne Warwick and Karen Carpenter were cloned into one female jazz singer, this would be it.
0792164903|5.0|Just what a person needs while sitting before an open fire on these dark, long and cool Fall nights.

0440180295|5.0|It is rare for me to read a book in one sitting, I normally like to allow a night of sleep for full absorption, but this one got away from me.<br /><br />Billy was abducted by aliens, the tralfamadorians, who taught him that life could be viewed on a fourth dimension.  The forth dimension allowed you to move through your life, past or future and see yourself in different circumstances.  It's an interesting concept and is also the outlay of the book.  What it really helped deliver was a picture of Billy in all his complexity.  Since each of the main events in his life were introduced in pieces and gradually added to - by the end of the book the appreciation I had for the whole life of this man was immense.<br /><br />This is my first Vonnegut.  I was blown away by some of his theories, and whether he was quoting real people or invented them on his own I found him brilliant.  In particular there is an American, by the name of Campbell that I won't quote, but summarize:<br /><br />Americans (I'm adding Canadians, trust me it applies) are raised to believe that anyone can make money.  Money, in actuality, is not that easy to come upon.  What this theory has created a mass of poor people who live with the shame of being poor.  To them, it is not sociological or economical, but personal failure that has landed them in this state.  Above this, the ideal of anyone being able to make money has diminished the good will of the wealthy.  It has also decreased the brethren that exist among the poor in other nations, where you do not have to be wealthy to be knowledgeable or good.<br /><br />It's inspired.  Bravo.
6302886228|5.0|Own a copy on VHS and it is brilliant, surely time to release on DVD?
B00008DDRX|5.0|Perhaps the finest racing film to date, Le Mans is exceedingly atypical of the genre. It has minimal dialogue, few sidetracks of the artificial Hollywood-style human interest variety, and a steadfast focus on the subtle beauty of the sport. Superb cinematography pays homage to an era long-gone in motor sports, as the film concentrates on the realism of racing and the question of why some pursue such a dangerous sport despite its obvious risks and human casualties.<br /><br />Le Mans would serve well as a stylistic blueprint for other filmmakers. The recent Sylvester Stallone film \\"Driven\\" is an example of how most directors butcher the racing genre. Long on substance, full of intense visual and auditory imagery, and fully aware of the great history of the event, Le Mans captures well the spirit of its namesake.
B00005JNQA|2.0|The only thing to recommend about this film is the \\"director's commentary\\" in the extras section - where the director \\"pontificates\\" about how \\"hard\\" movies are to make and to be \\"releasable\\" - which the irony is - this film is so awful it should have been shelved. Gone are Syndey's good days as a viable filmmaker (Kubrick he's not)! The casting is terrible (absolutely no chemistry between Kidman and Penn) and the screenplay is completely inane and impossible to follow. This is definitely one for the Mystery 3000 boys! Everyone collected their checks on this one - zero craft - zero film!

0740748475|5.0|This is a sensational debut. The arrival of the complete archives of Calvin & Hobbes would be a stunning event regardless of the effort made by the publisher. The fact that it comes to us in a prestige format that satisfies the most anal of collectors-- of which number I include myself-- should cause the loudest rejoicing possible. <br />If you aren't familiar with the strip,_Calvin & Hobbes_ is the single most literate comic strip since Winsor McCay's _Little Nemo_. The adventures of little Calvin and his slightly wiser comrade, Hobbes, are among the smartest literature that have ever been produced. And, without a doubt, these strips are some of the most humane writing you will ever encounter.  <br />There aren't words enough to praise the arrival of this monumental collection. Buy it, give it to everyone you know, especially the folks who are younger. This is art at its most seriously enjoyable.
B000063JZQ|5.0|If there is one person on earth who can say \\"Life Sucks\\" and have absolutely no one argue with them, it's Roman Polanski.  He's a tormented artist who has done his SUFFERING in all capital letters.  His mother was killed in the concentration camps in Nazi Poland, his wife, Sharon Tate, unborn son and friends were killed in his house in Hollywood by the Manson Family, and he is living in exile in France because he got frisky with an underage girl.  And we feel his pain. <br /> <br />He took the classic Shakespeare tragedy of Macbeth and made it a gore fest.  Though it is still graphic, compaired to today it's much tamer.  This was Roman lashing out at the world following the murder of his wife and son.  Look at all the horror, the terror, the sorrow and tell me you don't feel his pain and anger and loss.  And that last scene ... The terror will continue.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album takes a lot of effort to get into---even if you've heard and like Paranoid Android or Karma Police in advance---the music is hard.  However, after 3 or 4 good listens, the attahcment to the music lasts forever.  Not as cold or distant as Kid A, but more experimental and conceptual than the (almost equally awesome) The Bends, this album may be the Sgt. Peppers of the 90's, an album that transformed how we view a band, but the things we loved about that band are still there.  The simple fact is, there are few albums I listen to as often, few albums complex enough to keep interest over a long period of time while seeming complete in and of themselves, few albums as good, period. <br /> <br />Best tracks: <br /> <br />I was going to try and pick some out, but really couldn't, the album as a whole is just too awesome.  I'll just say that Paranoid Android remains my favorite radiohead song.

B0000025C0|5.0|1978 was an incredible year in music, if not the best ever. I can't remember a year that I remember more EXCELLENT music from. When it came to hard rock that year, no-one had the chops of Boston. The first time I heard it at a friend's house, I was just blown away!  You see, I didn't own Boston's debut until I had Don't Look Back.  So I have a bit of a different perspective to review this from.  It's hard to compare the two albums, but I believe this one, I'll say, is my favorite of the two. Actually, I think the two would've made an incredible double set, but that didn't happen...so... <br /> <br />What I think makes this Boston's best effort is the fact that though it was rushed by Epic, it came out incredible!  Many folks think 'side two' as it used be called was weak compared to 'side one'.  I don't think so, unless of course you're referring to 'Used to Bad News' - the weakest song on the album, but not a bad one, by any means.  I'll just say this:  Don't Look Back starts out soaring and DOESN'T look back! What I mean is I have one of those CD players in my car that auto repeats the CD when it's done, and it's interesting...this CD starts out loud and dynamic, but just gets more and more powerful and dynamic all the way through, especially ending with \\"Don't be Afraid\\", which by the way is a great reprise of encouragement for \\"Don't Look Back\\".  But when the CD begins again, it's much quieter than the ending.  One thing I've noticed clearly is that \\"Used to Bad News\\" excepted, the guitar licks just keep getting more and more intense as the album progresses. It starts out powerful and majestic, but as it hits 'side two', the attitude shifts and the licks get more bluesy and definitely more hot, and clearly venture away from the 'let's repeat the riff' Boston formula which began on the first album and continued through the opening cut of DLB. Don't get me wrong, I like that approach at the end of the song, when the whole band fades and then the electric reprisesthe dominant riff in the song, to motor it up again, but if you do that all the time, it can get repetitive and possibly boring. Good thing Scholz' licks are as good as they are.  But I do like that they venture away from that as DLB progresses and gets into some of the most amazing guitar interchange ever recorded - just listen to \\"It's Easy\\", \\"Party\\" and \\"Don't be Afraid\\" real close and try and play along if you're a guitarist...you better be good, this stuff is hot! Just imagine what it would've been like if Scholz and co. would've had more time.  Another thing I like about this is that though I like the melodic leads that Boston most usually uses, there is a lot more free soloing on this album, but it NEVER loses it's melodic flavor. <br /> <br />Anyway, all that to say that EVERY time I listen to this CD, I get pumped!  And, I'll say this, too that if you're the kind of person that expects the same stuff from a band every time they put out something new, you shouldn't be wasting everybody's time reviewing music.  The only true way to review something is on it's OWN merits, and on that, Boston's first two efforts are their best, with Walk On a slightly distant third.  Third Stage is pretty good in it's own right, but Corporate America mostly stinks. <br /> <br />However, Don't Look Back is the one Boston album that just fires me up time after time!  The first three tracks all run together are 12 minutes of rock bliss, and some of the best 12 minutes of rock ever ran together!  I once owned a bootleg live vinyl of Boston that was 30 minutes on each side and it was amazing what they did with it live! Something like 18 minutes and then went into a 10 minute version of More Than A Feeling!  Anyway, my only dissapointment with Boston's first two discs is that there aren't remastered versions yet...man that would be awesome!  But, hey it still sounds incredible...and it's freakin' great!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|The Straight Story is an emotional and touching story of a man who journeys across several states to pay a visit to his sick, estranged brother, hoping to see him once more before he dies. It is sincere and simplistic in style, but effective nonetheless. A masterpiece by acclaimed director David Lynch.
B00005JO0J|5.0|The passion Joss Whedon, the film crew, and actors had for this movie, is the same thing Malcolm Reynolds has for his ship, Serenity.  You really follow this crew and see them as a family. You feel their joys, their fear, their sadness and their passions.     The prologue in this movie is interesting for both the Firefly fan and the folk who never heard of it.  You don't have to see the Firefly DVD series to enjoy the movie.  From the prelude, the rest of the movie is a journey into this family's toughest trial yet.       Check it out. It should be lesson to networks and movie studios alike. Make great characters, and a great story and people will watch it. But what does it take to make great characters and stories?  An excellent writer and time, time being the key.      I used to be a really into sci-fi, and TV shows in general and after Firefly, nothing really seemed worth watching.      Serenity doesn't have a feel of `just another episode.'  It stands alone and strong.     This movie is the diamond in the rough. It blew my expectations out.

B0009RCPY8|5.0|First I have to say that I put off getting this due to the fact that it said on the back of the box that the 1st movie was full screen and the 2nd was widescreen (I also own the original 1999 DVDs). I've heard people saying that that's really the way it is and some people say that they're both widescreen (as Amazon says they both are). I just purchased this and they are both in fact widescreen. They've recently corrected the box with the correct ratios (mine says both films are widescreen and gives their ratos). It's just a cosmetic mistake so even if the package says it's full screen and widescreen they're both in fact widescreen. The upgraded audio and video is truely great!

B000B0WODA|5.0|This is Franz Ferdinands second album and boy its better than ever. Everything has been made better and then some. The same super jumpy dance to music is back and they got even closer there goal of \\"Having Music Girls Could Dance to\\". The band is alot more hyper then last time not as many really slow songs in here. These guys give me a reason to want to read about history. The songs really are put together well and there are really no problems or cons in this album. Some of the best songs on here are: <br /> <br />The Fallen <br />Do You Want To <br />This Boy <br />Evil and a Heathen <br />You're the Reason i'm Leaving <br />Well That Was Easy <br />I'm your Villain <br />You could have it so much better <br />Outsiders <br /> <br />Pretty much everything in here rocks and still is better than ever. Buy this one no regrets you'll love it and will listen to it every day, don't regret it. This cd if a definate five perfect stars good job guys.

B000AYEIZY|5.0|Only being 17 years old, the proud son of a Cream fan, I was fortunate enough to travel over to London to see Cream's final concert (May 6, 2005).  The concert was amazing, and the talented three never missed a beat.  This CD is worth every penny and offers   perhaps ones of the finest performances of the year.  It is definetely a must-have for any former or current fan and for any children of that contingency (as I am) because Eric, Ginger and Bruce could outplay and have outlasted any other current group.  Go buy it!

0375413405|5.0|First,  I cannot cook.  other then basic heat and serve.<br /><br />So I bought a ton of cookbooks and tried a ton of recipes from the food network. Still could not cook.<br /><br />Picked up this book at a flea market ( the 1963 printing ).<br /><br />This book is incredible.  My kids not only will eat the food, but they love it. ( and they demand the food now ).<br /><br />I do not agree with other reviews about complexity and cost of the recipe's.  She provides both easy and complex recipes.<br /><br />The recipes are well thought out, with step by step insrtructions and illustrations.  The illustrations are priceless, cooking is alot of technique, and the illustrations walk you through it.  Every question I would have had about the ingredients or prep are covered.<br /><br />Oh, and ingredients..  She assumes that the grocery store is the only place you have to shop. So she notes how to adjust for canned or frozen vs fresh, and what you can substitute.  Not some cute ethnic market in New york city where everything is always in season from the 4 corners of the world.  You can literally take the book to the grocery store to buy your ingredients. and come out with everything you need.  ( I have a 40 year old copy of this book, and Julia's assumptions about what I will be able, and will not, to find in my grocery store is 100% correct. )<br /><br />Crepes - been trying for a year to make the kids crepes. tried several recipes online.  failed.  first attempt with Julia, and voila crepes.<br /><br />Omlette - so I could always make an omlette.  or at least I thought. now I am an omlette gourmet cook.<br /><br />I cannot wait to graduate to her other cookbooks.
B000B0WODA|3.0|Franz Ferdinand is back with their second album \\"You Could Have it so Much Better,\\" the follow-up to their smash 2004 self-titled debut.<br /><br />The sophomore album is always the hardest. You know how it is; a band will tour clubs and rehearse for years, playing the same songs until perfection, and then use up the best of the bunch for the debut. And what if the debut takes off? There is pressure to release a follow-up ASAP. So it isn't an infrequent occurrence that bands with a popular debut will often get stuck in a \\"sophomore slump.\\"<br /><br />So how does Franz Ferdinand fare on their second release? Do they fall into a \\"sophomore slump\\"? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Fortunately, \\"You Could Have it so Much Better\\" is still a pretty good CD.<br /><br />The Scottish quartet pretty much stick to the same formula that worked so well for them on their 2004 self-titled debut; a danceable mixture of Brit-pop and punk. There are a few highpoints, like the strong openers \\"Fallen,\\" and \\"Do you want to,\\" as well as the infectious \\"Walk Away\\" and the closing \\"Outsiders.\\"  While there aren't really any bad songs on this CD, most of the others are just good, but not great. They sound more-or-less like left-overs from the debut. It would have been better if the band took a little more time writing the follow-up to their debut, so they could be a little more creative and push the envelope. So while this is a good CD overall, it feels slightly underwhelming.<br /><br />Despite its faults, \\"You Could Have it so much Better\\" has plenty to offer. While the band does fall into the \\"sophomore slump\\" to some extent, if you are a fan of Franz Ferdinand's debut, you are sure to like the follow-up.
B00081EM7I|4.0|Back in 1990, when Ace records released the four CD box set (WPOXPD 1), featuring Funkadelic, Maggot Brain, Free Your Mind, and America Eats Its Young. The analog masters were simply transfered to CD, and the integrity of the original LP was strictly preserved. The result, was the excact sound of my LP collection, but on CD. <br /> <br />Today, I received the complete collection of 2005 Ace reissues. I got them because I wanted all the bonus cuts, plus I had heard some good things about the remixing of the tracks to produce better sounding recordings. I was not disappointed at all with the job Ace Records had done, in fact, I think that Ace accomplished what it was trying to do quite well. <br /> <br />However, hardcore listeners like myself will notice right away that the recordings are a bit TOO slick. Too clean. They sound sterile in comparison to the old CDs from 1990. Gone is all the hard panning from left channel to right that was typical of Funkadelic albums back then. <br /> <br />All the rough enginering found on the originals have been replaced with perfectly adjusted sound levels, bringing instruments to the forefront that are not only noticable, but somewhat distracting. Again, not bad, mind you...but if you know every nuance of these recordings like the back of your hand the way I do, you will be distracted hearing things that seem out of place to you. <br /> <br />If you've not heard these albums in a long time, you may not even notice such things. And if you've never heard them before, then you will be IMMENSELY happy with this album. But in my case, I had just listened to the 1990 CD minutes before the mailman showed up with my new ones. The new engineering stuck out like a sore thumb. <br /> <br />I give four stars because the album really does sound great. But I deduct one star because in sounding great, the mix causes the album to lose some of it's original charm. The original 1990 release better captured the reality of Funkadelic; gritty, nasty,funky, and wonderously imperfect.  <br /> <br /> The new sounding reissue is the \\"reinvention of the wheel\\". I think that I might have been happier with them just adding the bonus tracks.  <br />
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I first heard this band when they played at X-Fest in Dayton last month. They were the first band to play. I knew as I was watching them play that I was going to have to buy their CD. I saw their newest album \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" at K Mart a few days ago and I had to buy it. It's all I've been able to listen to since then. It's definitely one of my favorite albums. As always, here is a track by track run down:<br /><br />1. ATTACK: The only single (that I know of) off the album and it's also my favorite. This was the song they played at X-Fest that got me  hooked. I love the instrumentals, vocals, and screaming. This is the best song I have heard in a long time and is by far the best song on the whole album. \\"Your promises they look like lies, your honesty like a back that hides a knife\\" is my favorite line from the song.<br /><br />2. A Beautiful Lie: The title track, and I can see why they picked it to be the title, It's one of the most emotional songs on the CD. \\"Such a beautiful lie to believe in\\" is a great line from this song. I bet this turns out to be the next single. Full of raw emotion coming right from the singer's (Jared Leto) heart.<br /><br />3. The Kill: This songs starts off soft which  different from the previous two, but it gets harder. \\"Bury me, bury me, I am finished with you\\" is my favorite line. I really like the way Jared sings in this song. Instrumentally it's not a stand out song, but I really like the lyrics. One of my favorite songs on here.<br /><br />4. Was It A Dream?: This song starts off with the sounds of a thunderstorm, which makes me think of someone suddenly waking up because of a storm and wondering to themselves \\"Was that just a dream?\\" I really like the drumming in the beginning of the track, it gets you ready for what lies ahead. I love the line \\"Was it a dream? Was it a dream? Is this the only evidence that proves? A photograph of you and I.\\" and I get what he's saying. Him and his love have separated and the only evidence he has that they were ever really together is a single photo. Deep stuff, my 2nd favorite track.<br /><br />5. The Fantasy: I really like the instruments in the beginning and how Jared sings sort of fast (almost like a rap) and the echoes are a cool effect too. \\"Do you live, do you die, do you bleed for the fantasy? In your mind, through your eyes, do you see it's the fantasy?\\" I really like that line and how it's sang, I love to sing along to that part of the song more than any other. One thing this song could have done without are the \\"Oh Oh Wow's\\" at about 2 minutes in, kinda stupid.<br /><br />6. Savior: This track opens with the band just talking (I'm guessing in the studio while setting up) before the actual music starts.  I think the best line from this song is \\"Until the truth becomes a lie\\". This song is all about not wanting to be saved. I guess the singer wants to show that he can stand alone that he doesn't need help from everyone else. I've felt like that sometimes, where people help me out when I didn't want it or ask for it. It makes me think that these people think I am weak, and that's what the singer thinks too in the song.<br /><br />7. From Yesterday: This is a solid song, not that great, it doesn't stand out the way some of the others do, but isn't a bad song. It's easy listening. I don't quite know what the line \\"On his face is a map of the world\\" means. Like the vocals, the instruments are solid, nothing too spectacular, but still good.<br /><br />8. The Story: This song is the softest song on the whole CD. I really like this song, and I don't know why. There is just something about it that just clicked. I really like one of  the very first lines in the song: \\"I've been thinking of everything. Of me, of you and me\\".  This is one of my favorite songs on the CD.<br /><br />9. R-Evolve: I really enjoy the guitars in the opening of the song, very relaxing. I think this is one of the best songs instrumentally. Jared sounds cool (as always) when he screams in this song. I'm pretty sure that they played this song at X-Fest as well, I'm not sure (the only song I remember that they played was ATTACK).<br /><br />10. A Modern Myth: \\"Did we create a modern myth? Did we imagine half of it?\\" is the first line of the song and I think it's the best line. One thing about this song, so screaming. Jared just sings softly and quietly, it almost makes you wanna fall asleep. That's not a bad thing, this song is just really relaxing. He says \\"Goodbye\\" A LOT in this song. Also, there is a bonus track after this song is over. The song ends at about 3 minutes in and from there it's all silence until 12 minutes and 27 seconds in. The song is only 1 minute and 47 seconds long.<br /><br />11. Battle Of One: Now, on the version I have there are 2 bonus songs. The first one being \\"Battle Of One\\". I think the drumming in the opening of this song is really good as well as a short scream by Jared and the guitars when they kick in. Really good screaming from Jared in this song.<br /><br />12. Hunter: With the instrumentals it's easy to picture yourself in a jungle somewhere. I bet Jared wrote this after watching some safari movie or something like that. Out of the 2 bonus tracks this is my least favorite of the 2. Actually, this is probably my least favorite on the album. But I've heard worse songs before, it's tolerable.<br /><br />So all in all, there are no bad songs on this CD, lots of stand out tracks and some average songs, but nothing below average. I really suggest you buy this CD, you will get hooked on it, like I did. And if you get a chance, see them live. Jared knows how to get a crowd pumped!lways) when he screams in this song.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is quite easily one of the worst films of which I have ever had the misfortune to allow myself to be subjected.  The film is not funny, mostly boring, and a complete waste of time.  It is a Wes Anderson film wannabe, without the wit, without the humor, and without talented actors to pull it off.  Do not listen to those who insist upon this film being something special; simply put, this film has no reason to exist.  See Rushmore which is infinitely better than this film.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I think everyone is finally gonna catch on that Avenged Sevenfold is going to push the forefront of what great music is. City Of Evil, their first album off of a major label (Warner Bros.),is a great album. THe music is so original that their is really no catagorie to play it in, it fuses punk, metal, and rock together into one amazing sound. M. Shadows original vocals are stellar,  Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance just murder the guitars, while Johny Christ is great with the bassline, and the Rev of course whaling on the drums. I have been a fan of Avenged Sevenfold for the past 3 years and i am glad that people are finally finding about these guys and hopefully they will cause the music industry to have a complete makeover of what type of bands we look forward to in the future! <br /> <br />Keep rockin metal heads, great music is not dead! <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />J. Shadows
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Bob Dylan, the enigmatic boy from the north country, the cryptic minstral, the pop-culture innovator, the icon, the unflinching oracle, the inadvertant spokesman who Bobby Zimmerman became talks about himself and the musical quest that created him rather candidly in this superb documentary (superb, that is, if you have a prior interest in Dylan).  If you're a Dylan devotee, a lifelong fan or a johnny-come-lately, an historian of the American story in the second half of the twentieth century or just someone who admires dogged integrity in those who are true masters their art, buy this movie.

B000AMPZGC|1.0|So Tim Burton and Danny Elfman have once again demonstrated how stale their creativity really is. They have one theme, and even if they try to drift from it, it leaks in. That theme? Gothic.<br /><br />Well, they tried the forumla that worked on me before (Nightmare Before Christmas), and re-worked the style into a new story, Corpse Bride. Too bad it's not interesting. The film was an extreme let down, and the music...gah<br /><br />The music where characters sang seemed so unbelievably half-hearted.<br /><br />And the instrumentals? Let me say this: Did you like Danny Elfman's instrumentals in Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, and the Nightmare before christmas? Good, because you'll be hearing them again, blended together, for \\"Corpse Bride\\"<br /><br />Skip this, the movie and the CD.<br /><br />But, if you regularly shop at \\"Hot Topic\\", you won't listen to a word I say, will you?

I saw Nemesis at the theather and, a a Star Trek fan I was kind of excited, but if I put myself in the shoes of somebody who doesn't see Star Trek as I do, or isn't a fan, will surely think this movies isn't that good at all, and it's boring and stupid. And that's the truth.  <br />I was expecting this movie to be something more epic, because it indeed had a great theme, and the possibilities for a great and explendid story, and great starships battles and character conflicts. But no, it stayed in a little square, not daring to venture even a little outside of it, and make it bigger, like an all opne conflit between Federation Starships and a fleet on Romulan Warbirds, and who knows, even a little special appearance by Spock. <br />Even though I really liked the battle scenes, and the conflict between Picard and Shinzon, I think this is one of the weakest Star Trek Movies ever. But at least Picard is still alive, and a better movie can be made someday. I hope this wasn't really a \\"Star Trek The Next Generation\\" goodbye, because if it was, I'm really disapointed with Star Trek.
B00000F5KH|5.0|I just watched this movie for the fourth time. I had to show it to friends when it was released back in 1999. And after almost six years I still get the same emotions every time I watch it. This is the kind of movie that reminds people that simple things in life are the ones that should be cherished the most. A friendship that was born out of necessity and doubt, and a partnership that leads the two main characters into a world where the true meaning of \\"well doing\\" is exposed. Central Station captures two opposites' souls in a sort of a dance of character and personality, bringing different worlds together: The old and the young, a woman and a boy, a literate and an illiterate, experience and novelty. Central Station is sure to capture your attention for two hours and leave a feeling of satisfaction in you after seeing it. Superb acting and a great storyline are the main elements that make this journey, one that will stick to you for years to come.
B000002OG5|5.0|To appreciate this soundtrack fully it is essential to have seen and enjoyed the film although the music is haunting in its own right. Yes, the CD is only just over an half hour in length but quantity is compensated for by quality. The music perfectly captures the moodiness of the film and its period. Buy this CD and you will not be disappointed. It is a low price to pay for owning a 'cut' of movie history - it will be timeless for you.
B000AL730O|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out and have listened to it over and over ever since.I've played it for others to get their reactions. There is a consensus that this may be the best solo McCartney album ever.  It may lack the energy of Band On The Run or the grandiose elegance of Ram or the Beatle's like coda to the standout songs on his first album but this is  a songwriter focused and accomplished at just being himself. There is no dead weight on this album. No embarassing Biker Like An Icon or Motor Of Love to mar otherwise good work.  From the opening Beatle worthy track Fine Line to the Randy Newman-like Anyway that closes the album McCartney is never wasteful. In fact the album ends (after a fun hidden track) with the listener wanting more  If  one were to criticize I suppose it might be said that songs like Jenny Wren and English Tea are McCartney imitating himself but it is more accurate to say he is working in the idiom that he himself invented. If Jenny Wren is the daughter of Blackbird who else has ever even come close to writing another Blackbird?  There is also McCartney imitating (intentionally) George Harrison in the wonderful Friends To Go and yet McCartney still manages to push himself into areas where he hasn't gone before on songs like At The Mercy and Riding To Vanity Fair.  For the record I will state that I enjoyed Flaming Pie though it is a little long and at times self indulgent.Run Devil Run is an extraordinary album and a must for anyone who loves rock n' roll though it is an album mostly interpreting the work of others. Also I give McCartney points for trying something different and stretching out and experimenting on Driving Rain though it all doesn't work and that album was a slight step backwards lyrically.    But when all is said and done if you like the most gifted melodicist of his era focused at what he does best then you will enjoy this album.Kudos to the excellent production by Nigel Godrich - McCartney should continue to workwith him and most of all, kudos to Paul McCartney to show us all that one can go grow old gracefully and to achieve great work worthy of a master.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|I picked this up the other day on a whim. <br /> <br />I was looking for the another album by another artist.  When I couldn't find it, one of the store associates suggested I try this one (even offered to let me return it for store credit if I didn't like it). <br /> <br />My goodness!  What an interesting sound.  Kind of a cross between maybe Enya, Bjork and I don't know who else (okay, maybe not quite that particular mix, but something). <br /> <br />\\"Glosoli\\" is just plain amazing.
B00000JFV9|5.0|There aren't many albums that are as well constructed as Curtis Mayfield's \\"Superfly\\", let alone movie soundtracks. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Every track is consistent with the overall theme of the album, yet they remain strong when listened to individually. I challenge anyone to listen to \\"Pusherman\\" or \\"Little Child Running Wild\\" and not be moved by the beat or the lyrics. Although created for the blaxploitation flick \\"Superfly\\", this album stands up on its own thirty years since its release and remains vital. When you watch the movie \\"Superfly\\" today, it's amazing how badly the producers incorporated the music into the movie. The liner notes touch on this and point out several of the errors in judgement. That aside, I feel that this is a CD that everyone should hear. Even the songs that weren't hits are amazing. The instrumental \\"Think\\" is such a beautiful song, starting with an after hours blues guitar riff from Curtis and building to a crescendo that always gives me chills. The track \\"No Thing On Me (Cocaine Song)\\" is a powerful anti-drug statement (ironic considering the subject matter of the movie Superfly) and is a positive message that unfortunately is still needed in our addiction ravaged culture today. The slow and sexy \\"Give Me Your Love\\" is a wah-wah guitar driven jam that is some of the best make out music I've ever heard. If you haven't heard this album, don't hesitate, just get it. Chances are you will recognize many parts of the music, as this has been sampled by many hip-hop and R&B artists in the past few years who also recognize that this is one of the best albums ever recorded.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|After being captivated by Agaetis Byrjun a few years ago, I went out and bout \\"Takk,\\" Sigur Ros' newest album. After listening to it a few times I can already say it ranks right up there with Agaetis Byrjun and even has moments that surpass what many believe was Sigur Ros' \\"finest achievement.\\" <br /> <br />Takk opens with \\"Takk...\\", merely an introduction into the masterful \\"Glosoli,\\" which is accentuated by a rhythm of what sounds like footsteps in the mud, and eventually moving onto solid ground and even later onto snow, giving the listener the impression of a person walking up a mountain higher and higher until the incredible climax in which guitars come shredding in like sunlight through the clouds, or perhaps a volcano erupting right under the mountain climber, or perhaps both. <br /> <br />The album continues with \\"Hoppipolla,\\" probably the happiest song on the album - opening with a piano riff which fades into what sounds like bells playing the same riff. The title translated into English is \\"Jumpin Puddles\\" and is accurate as it gives a listener the thought of playing in puddles after rain, right when the sun comes out. This song is followed by the much shorter \\"Meo Blodnasir,\\" pretty much a reprise of the same tune, (but backwards?) but serves as a transition in to the epic next track \\"Se Lest.\\" This song reminds me of a lullaby being sung to a litle child as nightlife continues outside. The ending of this song features a brass band overpowering the tune of the song, reinforcing this idea  <br /> <br />And when the lullaby is over and the child is finally asleep, a listener can hear ice forming over the windowpanes as he slowly drifts into a dream, which is the next song - \\"Saeglopur\\" (Lost at Sea). And this song is really a dream to listen to... the centerpiece (and masterpiece) of this album literally takes you to another world. In the beginning of this song, one can imagine a tiny boat floating through massive glaciers while tiny snowflakes fall and melt into the water. The music actually \\"sparkles\\" with the sounds of a music box, xylophone, and beautiful harmonies. And then the song bursts open as the drums kick in with the rest of the band. The tiny boat is now being whipped about on massive ocean waves while a blizzard rages around the boat. And finally the song calms back down, as does the listener, signalling that the boat has made it back home... or maybe to heaven - peace after tribulation as the tiny boat pulls into harbor. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is much more subdued, but still very very good. \\"Gong\\" is probably the best and most memorable song here. Led by raging drums and a laid back guitar riff, this song reminds of Radiohead, and is obviously influenced by them, yet somehow keeps a Sigur Ros flavor, and keeps in line with the theme of the album, which could be described as \\"fairy tale\\" or something similar. However, as a whole the second half cannot match the sheer brilliance of the first half of this album. I encourage a listener to listen to it the whole way through though, as the two halves together really do tell a fascinating and captivating story (as evidenced by the \\"booklike\\" packaging). <br /> <br />Buy this album now.
B000BKJ78K|5.0|It always amazes me how people who collect Star Wars memorabilia always get upset when a product they previously purchased is re-released in a fashion that doesn't give them something \\"more\\". Some of the early negative reviews point strongly to the fact that these collectors or fans think that the Star Wars product world is geared solely towards their needs as a collector without thinking about a consumer who doesn't sleep in his 25 year old pair of Boba Fett Underoos every night. I am a huge Star Wars Collector and fan myself and I would ask the original critics of this DVD release who think that Lucasfilm is \\"CASHING IN\\" need to explore another possible motivation for this release.<br /><br />Come on folks, this set sold at a lower price point, now with an SRP of $49.98 versus the $69.98 original release SRP, so that more people who maybe couldn't afford the first set or were perhaps on the fence as to spending that much money can now purchase this one.<br /><br />Does that scenario maybe make a little sense over the conspiracy theory that LFL LTD is only trying to make money off of collectors?<br /><br />Hey you can always wait for the HD-DVD and Blu-Ray versions.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot, no one is forcing, no pun intended, you to purchase it either.<br /><br />I don't know, this is only my opinion and I could be wrong.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|Admittedly I was a fan when this series was aired.  But almost 50 years later I am pleased that these sample episodes have stood up well in the passing of time.  The picture quality is as good as you can get for black and white TV.  The writing, and particularly the acting, is excellent.  James Garner established himself as a star.  Too bad he left the show after only severl seasons.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|After months of listening to Mezmerize I keep enjoying most of the songs off the CD, and no wonder I do. <br /> <br />As always politically charged, as usual talentedly played and sung, those tunes make you believe in a true originality of one of the best nu-metal bands out there. <br /> <br />Some things have definitely changed: we have less of Tankian's singing and much more of Malakian's, that adds a diversity, though can make many miss the Serj's indisputable vocal talent. We even have songs on here that are rather original even for System of a Down: BYOB (many fans have been amused by a poppy chorus, which in fact is incredibly good), Violent Pornography (the chorus, thanks to Malakian, easily reminds of some much more regular pop-metal products), and, of course, Lost In Hollywood (something really unusual but obviously extremely beautiful). <br /> <br />Anti-war theme is absolutely dominant through the whole material on the CD, and it's understood. And even though nowadays there is a whole trend of exploiting the war for commercial music making, I hope, the guys are honest enough with addressing the issues of the soldiers sent abroad. <br /> <br />The strongest stand-outs with no doubt are BYOB, Radio/Video, Question!, Sad Statue, and Lost in Hollywood. <br /> <br />Join those who's looking forward to Hypnotize. <br />
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|It took me a long to time to really accept this band. Not just the band but Jared Leto as a singer. You think of actors that have bands like Russel Crowe, Bruce Willis, and Keanu Reeves, and they suck. I still remember Jared on \\"My So Called Life\\" (which i admit i liked) and i cant picture him being a rocker. Then i bought the album. Any doubt i had about this band was washed away after the 2nd song. I was amazed at how good it is. Jared can actually sing. I was amazed and I love the album. It has kind of a \\"The Used\\" feel but the songs are darker and Jared is phenomenal. <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM.
B0002ZYE1Y|1.0|This is one of those if your a collector like me you just have to purchase it to make the collection complete. I've been listening to Nightwish since Wishmater and fell in love with them. I have all their cd's. This is probly the most annoying cd that I have of them. I have all their cd's and most of their singles and I just can't listen to this thing except for a couple of songs. NEMO, I WISH I HAD AN ANGEL and PLANET HELL that's it. It was and is a pleasure to see them come to the states, I have seen them 3 times, ATLANTA, CHICAGO AND MINNEAPOLIS. Great shows, great songs, but awful new album. Please, I beg you please, to go back to Century Media you released some great albums with them and when you reunite with them, you'll release your greatest album('s) ever. On your next CD, have a duet with Tarja and Marcus.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I really don't even know where to start.  I can remember one of my friend's playing American Idiot on his i-pod, and I absolutely hated that song!  I heard it everywhere, and promised myself that if that was just a taste of what the album sounded like, I would never buy it.  Then, more of their songs began being played on the radio.  I absolutely fell in love with Holiday, and Wake me up When September Ends.  Finally, I gave in a decided to buy the album!  It is AMAZING!!!!  Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming are my two favorite tracks because of the change in the lyrics and the music.  American Idiot is an amazing album with a lot of feeling to it.  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!!!  Great Job Green Day!

B0002X314C|4.0|Well, I've got to admit, this guy's voice is amazing! He is very original and you won't hear many people singing in the \\"old school\\" R&B style anymore. My one and only complaint with an otherwise solid cd (with little to no filler) is the number of songs about cheatng. Even one of the \\"love songs\\" was apologizing for cheating (number one). He tells his girl that even though he sleeps around he \\"wraps it up\\" and she is still his number one girl. I really wouldn't care if there was only one song or maybe two. But theere are references to cheating in four songs straight(some of which the whole song is about cheating). Sadly, one of the best songs on the album is She Don't Have To Know. I would just appreciate the cd more if it had more love songs and relatable songs, and if I could play it around my fiance' without making her uncomfortable.  <br />Also, I kind of found it funny, but I could swear that \\"get lifted\\" has little more to do with a plant that a lover. Great cd, but not one that is easily relatable through the whole cd, and not one that you would play at a romantic dinner. <br /> <br />If you want great soul vocals and lyrics that you can identify with, check out Anthony Hamilton. Hope this helped.
B000002U6E|5.0|I own all Enigma albums as I became a big fan after listening to this album, which to this day I feel is his best work. This being Enigma's second album was still in the time when he experimented with different sounds rather than beats. Some of the songs became instant hits due to their great videos, and others, like the very first track of the album, you simply have to hear...
B0009S3HI0|4.0|I'm a HUGE Deftones fans, there isnt a single song fromt hem that I'll say \\"eh that's okay\\" I LOVE every Deftones song. <br />What saddens me about this cd is of course the lack of \\"To have and to Hold\\"  <br />Though I was VERY excited for Wax and Wane. <br />The dvd? eh I never really enjoyed the Deftones music videos, they're so amazingly artistic and their videos never really show for that. <br />This was a great birthday gift to myself though. And I'm agreeing with the other reviews, this is a cd for dedicated fans and ocd complete collection kind of people!(I happen to be both, heh)
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is kind of hard to pick up and play <br />you have to apreciate it, It's not about being <br />catchy it's a message. Finding peace in a world <br />full of stress, and yet feeling uneasy when you  <br />get that peace. That is how the album feels. <br />You have to hear it and appreciate it. <br />If youve never heard it before It's kind of like <br />The Passion of The Christ... It can be very tough <br />if you have never heard it before, but you end up <br />glad you heard it. That is truly a strange comparison <br />and yet it fits.  <br /> <br />   Tough to pick up, But you'l be glad You did

0385338686|3.0|I bought this book because I had lots of fun reading all 4 shopaholic books. I was expecting as much fun as I had with the others, but unfortunatelly it wasn't the case. It's a fun light book to read but not an unforgettable one!

1400031087|4.0|James Frey book is probably the best book I have ever read. And not because Oprah picked it out. He is brutally honest about his  stay at the hospital. He takes personal responsibilty for his actions, and blames no one but himself. I only read a couple reviews on the book(here on amazon), and was sad by some of the negative reviews. I guess the message is what works for one person, may not work for another. I don't want to give too much away, but just because James doesn't do things the conventional way, doesn't make his way wrong. What works for one person, maybe not work for another. I looked some info up on James and he is 36 years old, and it is obvious he has straightened out his life. If anything, James is hard on himself, and NOT pompous, arrogant, or overly confident. The only thing I wish is that James shared a little bit more about his parents. It seems like there are some gaps that should be filled.
1401201911|5.0|Like Dark Knight Returns, this one will become a classic for comic geeks like myself.   <br /> <br />Rather than just reimagining Superman as a tool for the Soviet Empire, the writer subtlely compares the strengths and weaknesses of American capitalism and Soviet socialism, and while the book clearly leans toward an American system, the fact that the greatest Superman villain, Lex Luthor, remained a \\"American capitalist\\" in this Elseworld, makes you wonder. <br /> <br />Red Son dares to be political in a child's popular medium and dares to challenge our view of not only the \\"Superman world\\" but also the political world in general.  Rather than blandly stating America was better than the Soviet Union, the author suggests there were virtues and flaws in both \\"Empires.\\"  A brilliant comic that could be discussed in an English or Political Science class and also absorbed and enjoyed by teenagers.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|This series is the best on TV... funny smart and required watching for moms and daughters. The 3rd season is Rorie's senior year... full of change... Love it
0321213351|3.0|The book is great, and I've learned a lot from it.  I REALLY wanted to give it 5 stars, but the lack of full source code for the examples, detailing before and after application of the refactoring techniques, forced me to give it a 3.  Ended up spending way too much time trying to piece together the snippets of code in order to fully understand what was going on.
B00005JNQA|2.0|Having heard such a buzz about 'The Interpreter' I couldn't wait for the movie to be out on DVD and got it reserved at the local video store on the day of the release. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, my intense curiosity and interest waned very quickly. Having heard nothing but great things about the film, I expected to be thrilled. Instead, this fatally flawed movie simply dragged on - aimless, blind, and totally handicapped by a ridiculous, and sometimes desultory script, leading to an almost embarrassing denouement. <br /> <br />Catherine Keener is completely wasted [talent not alcohol, ha ha], and I'd use the same terms for Kidman and Penn as well. Notwithstanding her family's horrible fate at the hands of Zuwanie, it was pretty difficult to sympathize/empathize with her character. In 'Dogville' you'd have rooted for her despite her cruel decision at the end, but here, despite the constant victimization, your heart feels exactly 0 lbs heavier. To make things worse, there is zero chemistry between the leads - although I do feel they could have explored Penn and Keener a bit more; and simply no glue left to hold the script together once the final act began.  <br /> <br />You could almost feel yourself begging the writer not to swamp things even more toward the ending - luckily the alternative ending was a disaster while the original one just about managed to hold on to the last shred/thread of believability. <br /> <br />I can understand that some people are enamored of the film and the acting - after all, there are OSCAR winners on board - but I fail to see how overall I'd give this dud anything more than 2 stars. In fact, the presence of OSCAR winners raises expectations to a very high level. <br /> <br />The plot holes are big enough for an 18-wheeler to make a u-turn through, and some unbelievable scenes [Kidman's brother saying \\"It's OK\\" right before dying after getting shot - laughable; and the bus scene is ludicrous for its depiction of otherwise highly intelligent Secret Service operatives] only served to lower the credibility and likeability of the script further. <br /> <br />In summary, while Kidman and Penn have performed admirably, it's really difficult to say a great many good things about the movie itself.  <br /> <br />On the plus side, the music was excellent and totally non-intrusive [Take that, Jerry Goldsmith!] and the cinematography was splendid, capturing the essence of the locations. <br /> <br />On the minus side, the script was terrible, detached; the pace pathetic, and the twists most unbelievable. <br /> <br />See if only if you have nothing better to do...and yes, no flames from fans, please :-) <br /> <br />Sesh
B000002L75|5.0|Ah, Depeche Mode's major transitional album.  Before this, pure synthpop with fun if sometimes vapid lyrics--after this, increasingly serious, sensual, and depressing themes fit for a more mature band.  SOME GREAT REWARD (SGR) lies somewhere in the middle.  Thematically different from its immediate predecessor, CONSTRUCTION TIME AGAIN, SGR focuses more on love, lust, and deceit than an overt political agenda.  Let's review this album track by track: <br />1. \\"Something to Do\\" <br />Reminiscent of \\"More Than a Party,\\" in my opinion but with deeper, danker lyrics.  Not my favourite, but it's rather energetic.  5/10 <br />2. \\"Lie to Me\\" <br />Rather the heart of SGR, this song deals with lies in a relationship and mirrors the cover art (which I'll mention again at the end of the review) splendidly.  10/10 <br />3. \\"People Are People\\" <br />One of DM's most memorable tracks.  On any 80's station.  9/10 <br />4. \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" <br />A strange, ballad-like song with almost confusing lyrics.  Fits the theme well, though.  7/10 <br />5. \\"Stories of Old\\" <br />I never tire of this song.  It fits me perfectly.  Concerns the inability of some to \\"compromise\\" themselves \\"for love.\\"  9/10 <br />6. \\"Somebody\\" <br />Ah, the classic ballad.  Something any love-starved teen can relate to.  My favourite DM song.  11/10 <br />7. \\"Master and Servant\\" <br />Bizarre, comical song.  Must be heard to believed.  Upbeat and dark all at once.  10/10 <br />8. \\"If You Want\\" <br />Hmm, not too fond of this one.  Innocuous lyrics put to a sinister beat.  6/10 <br />9. \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\" <br />Strong, provocative song.  Very thought-provoking and emotional.  I try not to play it during a lightning storm for fear of divine retribution.  10/10 <br />Altogether, despite two relatively weak tracks, SGR is one of the strongest albums in the extensive DM catalogue.  The songs are far more grown-up compared to their previous outings, and the cover art is quite evocative and lovely, perhaps my favourite.  The image of a married couple gazing into each other's eyes while standing before a dismal, grey factory strikes me to the soul as do most of the songs herein.  A must have for any fan!
B000002MIF|5.0|It's obvious that people who will say The Smiths as a band for gay people just goes to show how ignorant these new emo kids are to yesterday's music.These emo kids were prolly in their primary school when The Smiths came out of the British scene in the 80s. I should know because I was in High School back in the 80s when The Smiths first hit the NME charts with their first album. I'm a straight guy, along with five of my buddies who are into The Smiths long before these EMO kids learned to pop a CD in a sound system. Anyways...I just get a bit upset when people begin judging a band simply because the singer represented a specific community. Hey I like This Charming Man because it does have some of the best lyrics. This Night Has Opened My Eyes is another. <br /> <br />This is a good album. It's probably the best album they ever made. They have a Peel Session version of \\"Still Ill\\", has an interesting harmonica intro. Other songs are \\"How Soon is Now\\" and \\"Girl Afraid.\\" This is an album that you should definitely buy if you want to listen The Smith's best years. Take note of Johnny Marr's guitar-playing here and Rourke's bass playing. Fantastic. Spend your money on this. By the way, I still have my vinyl version of this album. Mint condition.  To new listeners who are just discovering the music of MY generation, get this album. You will cherish it.
B00008973A|2.0|As Ethan Mordden once wrote: if you don't believe in musicals, don't make one.  <br /> <br />A great stage musical, which A Chorus Line certainly is, carries its own dramatic weight; it doesn't need padding or \\"opening out\\", just a sense of what made it work in the first place.  The writers and producers here went the conventional route, and mucked up what's touching and true about A Chorus Line.  The movie dwells at length on the dreary backstory of Cassie and Zach, ruining both of them as characters, especially Cassie -- her motive in life is to DANCE, but she's forced to spend most of the movie mooning over Zach and their former love affair.  And the filming of the dance scenes is often infuriating: just when you get a strong sense of what a dancer is doing, the camera cuts away to look at something else.   <br /> <br />It's a shame that the movie's flaws take away from the fact that the cast is mostly excellent. There is a lot of fine dancing and acting on display, with one glaring and painful exception:  Audrey Landers in the part of Val. That Ms. Landers can't dance is painfully obvious (the camera is constantly cutting around her to disguise the fact); obviously she was cast so there would be one semi-\\"name\\" among the featured dancers.  When one thinks of all the supremely talented young performers who would have killed for the chance to play Val onscreen,  it's easy to feel insulted by the conventional thinking behind this movie. <br /> <br />For the last time: either believe in it, or don't do it.      <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Holy smokes.  What an accomplishment.  I had no idea what to expect picking this up, only that this guy was getting a lot of good buzz.  Epic.  But peacefully so.  That's the best way to describe this.  A concept of sorts, although I'm not sure what the \\"concept\\" is other than all the songs have some connection to Chicago, directly or indirectly.  But doesn't matter.  This is just a beautiful, strange album.  Conjures up Americana, folk singers, weird carnivals, tent revivals, the vaguely Gothic.  I love it.  Might be the best album of the year so far.  Probably is.  It's a statement.  A creative tour-de-force with no regard to genre or any established musical convention.  But this is one you listen to at home so don't buy if you don't plan it giving it some regard.  Buy Franz Ferdinand instead.  Highest recommendation possible.

B000007ODX|5.0|Not being familiar with Chopin's music (other than the Polonaise - Polish Air), I must admit that his compositions (particularly the nocturnes) are among some of the best classical music that I've been privileged to hear.  This is an excellent collection - 2 for 1, can't be beat!  Barenboim does an excellent job in the presentation of these pieces.  Thanks to this CD, I can get work done (at work, no less!).  Highly recommended!
B000B5XOXY|1.0|this film  was the start of the end of the \\"real\\" batman films...after 2 blockbuster films  Batman(1989) and Ratman Returns(1992) starring micheal keaton and directed by tim burton..the franchise jumped the shark so early..thanks to the  aging hippie joel schumacker  (he should have stick to films he was good at  such as car wash..and the lost boys..even the phantom of the opers the musical) i guess it started falling apart was that BOTH burton and keaton did not like the script...i dont blame them at all..  the story for this film was pathetic..and then bringing in val kilmer at batman was poor casting indeed(although he did his best i suppose) then we get robin..i know im not the only one who thought robin should have not been added in this film..then nipples on the batsuit..WTF??!! and dont get me started on jim carrey's riddler (he needed to be on medication  thats for sure) the only villian  was good was two-face  but they should have had billy dee williams who played harvey dent in the first film..this would have been great casting ...all in all  its not worth watching, if u love nicole kidman  then check it out  she vamps it up in a few scenes  but she could not save this film...
0399152717|4.0|NUMA is the National Underwater and Marine Agency, founded by Clive Cussler in 1979. This is a real organization, dedicated to the discovery and study of shipwreck artifacts, as well as a fictional one. The fictional NUMA is a kind of super special operations agency solving crises at sea. The word \\"swashbuckling\\" comes up a lot.    This adventure centers on the work of Laszlo Kovacs, a brilliant Hungarian inventor and scientist whose work developing an electromagnetic interference device for the Nazis to use as a weapon was interrupted when the Russians invaded at the end of the war. A group of neo-anarchists, bent on destroying the World Bank and other institutions of world order, has rediscovered his theories and plans to develop their own interference weapon to hold the world hostage. If this technology is directed at the earth's magnetic poles, the resulting chain reactions would destroy the planet.    A trial of the magnetic interference technology wreaks all sorts of havoc at sea, including a rogue pod of killer whales and a gigantic whirlpool, drawing the attention of NUMA's crack team. They soon learn that the secret to Kovacs's work --- and how to stop it --- may be in the hands of Kovacs's unwitting granddaughter, busy with her own totally unrelated research concerning woolly mammoths. The race is on! Who will get to the granddaughter first?    A certain suspension of disbelief is required, but readers who know and love Clive Cussler's work should have no trouble obliging. He's not a fancy writer --- for instance, you'll get no more attempts at characterization than a job description, a wardrobe description, and eye color --- but by page 40, flashbacks to World War II have shown us Professor Kovacs's escape from assassination, a cargo ship has been sucked down to the bottom of the sea, and our hero, Kirk Austin, has faced a killer whale on his kayak. POLAR SHIFT sets a course for adventure, and if you're in the mood for a little escapism, you'll enjoy thevoyage.    (...)

B000A0GYD2|3.0|A voyage that took years of planning, insurmountable odds, and the imagination of a nation.  Technology that had never been invented, uncharted machines to test, not to mention the perils of sending astronauts into the cold depths of space.  Many thought that going to the moon was insane and suicidal.  Some thought that it wasn't possible, others thought it a waste, but the majority saw it as a chance for the human race to shine (not to mention the politics involved).  This is what the series tries to captures; The missions hardship, the endurances, the courage, and the audacity to dream big. <br /> <br />The series in its entirety is quite amazing, even to this day!  The special effects, though dated, can still (at times) cause you to stare and be amazed at the quality of some of them.  The audio quality is quite good, not to mention a superb sound track, that plucks at the heart strings.  Tom Hanks (and his crew) knew how to pull it together, to enthrall the watcher... to capture them in the moment.  At some points, I will admit, the viewing does slow down a bit... and it appears as if what's happening is losing focus, but that is very far and few between   <br /> <br />I do not have the orginal series to compare the widescreen version to, to see if they actually did chop the top and bottom, so I cannot comment on this.  I can, however; state that although I would be displeased if they did chop the film to make it fit widscreen tv's, it doesn't take away from the film.  There isn't a moment that goes by that I go \\"Look they cut out a really important image at the top!\\".  Sure it would be nice if they left it alone (if there was no original widescreen shooting of the movie) but like I said, it doesn't deter one from watching it. <br /> <br />So If I praise this series, then why did I give it 3 stars?  Quite simple, the packaging.   <br /> <br />The packaging for this boxed set could have been much much better.  Even the quality of the dvd's could have been much better.  I just recently returned one box set because Disc #2 was scratched (looked like it happened during the creation of the dvd).  So I returned it, and got another one... took it home... opened it up, and that one is scratched as well!  Not only is it scratched, but it's the same dvd that's scratched and it looks like it's the same exact pattern of scratching (scratches run the width not radial scratches).  This lead me to believe that it's a manufacturing defect, and it may be on many copies of this box set... if not all of them (which is hopefully unlikely).  Why is it only occuring on disc 2?  I have no clue, it could be that each dvd is created on a seperate machine... or mabye I have bad luck... <br /> <br />But that's not all, the case is quite fragile.  It's not fragile as in dropping it will destroy it (although you risk spilling your dvds out, or putting quite a dent in the case).  It is very suseptible to scratches and dings.  If you tap the case, you can dent it, the shrink wrap that was protecting it left an imprint in the box (were the edges of the wrap were joined).   <br /> <br />The inside is nice, but equally flimsy, not very sturdy.... not to mention it to is very suseptible to drops, dings, and scratches.  Don't get me wrong, I love the layout and the attempt to have an original case... but in doing so made a case that just isn't worth the amount you spend.   <br /> <br />For nearly $70 you should get a much sturdier and more protective case and dvd sleeves.  Many boxed sets have more dvds, cost less, and are enclosed in a much better, sturdier, and well designed case.  This is a case of form over function, when it should be function over form.  The box is indeed very pretty and the inner sleeve case has a nice layout... but you feel like it needs to be handled with gloves, or you may destroy it. <br /> <br />In the end, I love the series, it's a very powerful set of shows to watch, however; it has it's downfalls.  After buying the box set, I'mleft feeling that... although this is a great series, I've been let down.   <br /> <br />I feel as if HBO slapped this together in what they thought would be a nice shiney attractive box (which it is!!!  But is poorly built for the price), and put it in widescreen (knowing that the majority of the public now likes widescreen over full, and this is assuming that they chopped it... which may or may not be the case)... then they slapped a high price tag on it because it carried Tom Hanks name and was a great series. <br /> <br />Pros: <br />Awesome Series <br />Great Acting <br />Great SoundTrack/Effects <br />Nice Menu System <br /> <br />Cons: <br />Poor Case Design (need to handle it with gloves) <br />DVD's can be faulty (as two #2 discs had identical scratches on them) <br />Pricey <br />Sometimes the quality of the video seems to change from scene to scene (and I'm not talking about video that is 40+ years old I'm talking about the video that contains the acting). <br /> <br />In the end, would I recommend this?  IF you have $70 that you don't know what to do with!  If you don't... well wait awhile I'm sure the prices will eventually drop.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|\\"Pumping Iron\\" is just what a documentary about any type of competition should be.  Much like \\"Spellbound\\" and \\"Mad Hot Ballroom,\\" it pulls the viewer into the lives of the competitors.  You won't just root for the underdogs and boo the bad guys; you'll feel their pain and frustration and anxiety, as well as their determination and excitement and comradarie.    \\"Pumping Iron\\" was made in the mid '70s, long before cut abs and 22-inch biceps and were the physical ideal in American culture.  The film shows the greatest bodybuilders in the world training in basements and gyms smaller than the juice bar at the Bally's I used to go to.  Their equipment looks like they found it in a dumpster behind an inner-city jr. high.  These guys aren't spending hours and hours in the gym to get in shape for their next movie or to score a Powerbar endorsement.  They're doing it for the sheer love of the game . . . or art . . . or whatever you call bodybuilding.    If you liked \\"Spellbound\\" and \\"Mad Hot Ballroom,\\" you'll enjoy \\"Pumping Iron,\\" too.  Even if you're not a fan of documentaries or of bodybuilding, it's fun to watch, just for the unintentionally comedic scenes, as well as the sad moments that, at least for me, hit close to home.  You'll get a kick out of hearing a 20-something-year-old, unknown Austrian bodybuilder with big dreams (guess who) compare the feeling of a good workout to, err, \\"climaxing\\" . . . repeatedly.  Watching a very young and shy Lou Ferrigno (pre-\\"Incredible Hulk\\") take crap from his overbearing father will get to anyone who's ever had an obsessive parent pushing them in sports, music, academics, etc.    Four stars.  Would've been five, but I think it loses a star for admittedly (see the special features) steering away from documentary and inventing some conflict to crank up the drama.
B0000027RL|5.0|I truly think this is the bbest pearl jam album by far...It has some unique moments and a sound of its own that can't be found in any other pearl jam albums. The songs are great. Some of the compositions are really good. Eddy' s voice carries the emotions really well. In terms of music, there are great \\"jam\\" moments too particularly in \\"even flow\\" \\"alive\\" and \\"porch\\". But overall, what gives \\"ten\\" its beauty is its \\"dreamy\\" feeling. To me, songs like \\"black\\" \\"garden\\" and \\"release\\" stand out above anything else. I remeber listening to \\"release\\" in the bath once, letting the water out as the song progressed. It was magic.  <br />\\"Ten\\" remains one of the best albums of my listening experience.I will always love this album.
B00003CXA6|3.0|While I greatly enjoy this movie, the DVD is very disappointing. In fact, this is one of only a small handful of items I have had to return to Amazon as defective. I may simply have gotten a bad DVD that barely played, skipped badly, and almost rattled right out of the player but some of the other features were not well done either. <br /> <br />Being as long as it is the movie is on both sides of the DVD and given how often one side of a double will get scratched sooner or later you will lose half of the movie. The special features themselves are split between both sides, most of them on side B. <br /> <br />A strange feature is that the individual interviews come across as unfinished and choppy given that they are clipped from the hour-long 'Making Of' feature narrated by Sheen. Not sure why they are redone in this manner. <br /> <br />The Gettysburg short produced by the park itself is a narration and sound effect piece using the monument locations in the park to overview the battle. Despite having no action at all it provides a good background to the overall fighting most of which you will not see in the movie.
B000002BYD|4.0|It all started when \\"alive\\" was released. This was the rock anthem of a generation. Soon after, \\"ten\\" was released and did by no means did it dissapoint. It was the sound of a different band with a fresh vocals, mellow rock and a talented singer amongst the hysteric seattle frenzy.\\"Ten\\" was a new rock direction. It led the grunge movement in a new direction leading to bands like \\"Soundgarden\\" and \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" to propel it forward.  <br />1993: the second Pearl Jam album \\"Vs\\" is released. Marketwise, it is a knockout. Charaqtcer wise, it is a huge disapointment. The beautiful compositions that once were have now turned themselves into bland commercial melodies, and the band's confidence gives them an unfortunate \\"punkier\\" edge. Pearl Jam is now mass media. They are so big that they become the \\"anti-Nirvana\\". 1994, Kurt Cobain kills himself, Pearl Jam responds by relaesing their third album, \\"Vitalogy\\", as a the response to this worldwide political shock. An interesting album with some good compositions, but overall not much of a better achievement, and lacking a lot of focus.  <br />After 1995, bands like \\"Pearl Jam\\", \\"Soundgarden\\" and \\"Smashing Pumkins\\" seem to dissapear. The Seattle grunge movement is dead and isntead it is the Indie movement\\" that is back in business with bands like Radiohead slowly making their way to the top. <br />1996 is the end of the beginning for Pearl Jam. Thye relaes \\"No Code\\", a critically aclaimed album that quickly slops down to the bottom of the charts. Pearl Jam try something new, something more personal and it shows us they are sill alive and not been left to the fate of grunge vanishing away. <br />\\"Yield\\" is released in 1998, six years after the band was revealed. Here is the synopsis: <br />- \\"Brain of J\\" a punk opener reminiscent of \\"V's\\" \\"go\\" or \\"vitalogy's \\"No exit\\". A straightforward adrenaline number. <br />- \\"Faithful\\" : a sort of \\"I Got ID\\" rock number balanced by \\"No Code\\"ish melancholy and \\"Vitalogy\\" power. A great track. <br />- \\"No way\\" a more \\"chilled out\\" track with catchy chorus, but noting more. <br />- \\"Given to Fly\\": a Led-Zeppelin ish melody that has a rythm similar to \\"Animal\\". A bit coommercial but good vocals. <br />- \\"Wishlist\\": a forgettable simple melody that dwells in nothigness <br />- \\"Pilate\\": a part 2 of \\"Wishlist\\" <br />- \\"Do the Evolution\\": in line of Vitalogy's \\"Satan's Bed\\", No -code's \\"habit\\", but having more purpose and more enjoyable to listen to. <br />- \\"red dot\\": fun but a bit silly. <br />- \\"MFC\\": a short rock number wiith a great opening riff, that barely does the job in the end...but is saved by cool guitar effects. <br />- \\"Low Light\\": a sort of bland ballad, like \\"Nothingman\\", that is ok but a little too boring.   <br />- \\"In Hiding\\": a great track. Reminds me a lot of No Code's \\"Present tense\\". Very personal. Very heartfelt, but even more so with more intensity, and a better development. <br />- \\"Push Me Pull Me\\": Another red -dot. Belongs to the same class of songs as \\"Vitalogy's \\" \\"Bugs\\" and \\"Aye Davanita\\". <br />I like it. <br />- \\"All those yesterdays\\": similar to No Code's \\"Around the bend\\" but I like the former better. I find this one a bit bland. <br /> <br />So what is the verdict: <br />Pearl Jam took the best of their works from \\"Vitalogy\\" and \\"No-Code\\" and beefed it up with more guitars. Not a bad result at all! <br />How does this compare to Ten? It still doesn't. <br />The direction taken in Ten has been lost.. Pearl Jam have evolved in a different way. <br />After \\"Vs\\", things haven't been the same for Pearl Jam. They regressed to a young \\"punk\\" band and undoing this mistake is taking them a lot of time. But, Pearl Jam are slowly affirming their personality by finding their new direction. <br />In the midst of post-grunge decadence, \\"Yield\\" is the fruit of this quest.  <br /> <br />      <br />

0740748475|5.0|Everybody knows Calvin & Hobbes, but not everybody recognized the artistry, craft, skill and care that went into Bill Watterson's incredible strips. His daily strips were a mix of grim cynicism and playful melancholy, offering both commentary about the often absurd nature of the adult world and old-fashioned childlike fun, while his Sundays were flights of adventure and experimentation, places where he boldly played with color and layout and design. <br /> <br />Bill Watterson went out on top because he believed in his ideals. And I respect that. <br /> <br />With this collection, you get to see it ALL. Every last bit, plus plenty of extras. And $100 price tag or not, it's worth every penny and then some. <br /> <br />It really does not get any better than this set. It's just a superb in every way. A loving chunk of craftsmanship went into this release. The colors jump off the page, the books are of very high quality, and the extras include, well, pretty much EVERYTHING. All the added bits from collections of the past, including covers? It's all there. Plus, you know, 10 years of the most brilliant comic strip ever created. The thing is a monster. I got a workout just walking around the store with it.  <br /> <br />There could be no more comprehensive Calvin & Hobbes collection than this. Gorgeous packaging, layout, presentation, quality ... it's just a first-rate product from the word go. <br /> <br />This is a must have for any and all comic strip fans.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|there is a lot of hype in a lot of these reviews.  i for one am going to rain on the parade.  yes its great that cream returned and yes there are some great performances on these two discs.  however saying that the band sounds as youthful or as good as ever is just fan gushing.  i am a huge cream fan but i am not beyond hearing the rustiness.  for example compare this version of n.s.u. to the version found on live cream vol. 1.  the vol.1 version has much more energy, much better singing, and is four minutes longer.  on these reunion shows jack bruce can't hit the high notes when he sings and his bass playing while still pretty damn amazing, frankly sounds a little sluggish.  ginger isn't quite as powerful as a drummer, but again he is still pretty damn good.  the star on this album is by far eric, but even he doesn't sound the way he did with cream.  then again eric changed his guitar style almost completly between cream and derek and the dominos and has been consistent ever since.  his solos while not the fiery, speedy sound explosions of the sixties are the blusiest and best he's played in years.  this is especially evident on \\"sleepy time time\\" and \\"stormy monday.\\"  the solo at the end of crossroads is also great but can never compare to the original \\"wheels of fire\\" version.  this version actually sounds like a cross between that version and the version eric played with derek and the dominos that can be heard on the live at the fillmore east cd or the crossroads vol. 2 collection.  all in all this album is worth purchasing even if it isn't cream at their best, it is still leaps and bounds better than anything that is on the radio.  just don't buy it expecting to hear cream's return to their former glory.  also you may want to pick up live cream 1 & 2, wheels of fire, and goodbye to hear the original, longer live versions of these songs so as to experience cream at their peak.  also don't forget disarelli gears and fresh cream they too are essential.  nuff said.

1556154844|5.0|Most programmers cannot create reliable software. Most programmers do not construct computer programs correctly, regardless of methodology, language, platform, etc. For those who don't have a formal education in computer programming (e.g., Computer Science), or for those who don't want to forget the important concepts they did learn, Steve McConnell presents a classic text that drives all of these concepts home. McConnell covers everything involved in the process of constructing code, from methods of decomposition, to methods for prioritizing code comments. This book should be read by anyone who wants to improve the software they create.
0789723107|5.0|This is the best book I have read for designing effective web page interfaces. Steve Krug systematically marches through a no-holds barred, common sense approach that will have you building more effective web sites immediately. While the book may be thin (200 pages), it's chock full of excellent, time-tested concepts on practically every page. There is a downside to the book though--after reading it, you will undoubtedly look at any interface, whether digital or structural, and ask, \\"Why did they design it like that? It should be like this\\". That's about the biggest complement you can give a book.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I think this is a great album. All of her singles are hits on the album. Then joyride, one and only, and circles were also good. Overall, the CD is good. I can never get tired of Mariah's voice.
B0001D0FTW|2.0|Ok.. They've got some degree of talent but there's 2 types of talent when it comes to music;  Song-writing and playing.  These guys only seem to have the later since they can't bring it together consistantly enough.  Everyone raves about this singer and he's got good vocal range but horrible technique.  He scoops nearly every note he sings and sounds like he's singing through his nose.  Just pure crap.   <br /> <br />Helloween at least did some justice w/ \\"funny\\" songs but Edguy's attempts to be funny come off as crude, silly, and infantile.  \\"Lucifer in Love\\" is just stupidity at it's finest.  \\"Lavatory Love Machine\\"???  Y'ok Edguy... You guys are cool!  Riiiiight!  Sorry...  There's better metal in this genre to support.  You don't need to buy every garbage can of notes that's released.

0143034901|5.0|I purchased The Shadow of the Wind on the strength of the opening paragraphs which depict a father taking his young son to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, where he selects by chance a book with a history of its own, one at once shrouded in mystery and intrigue as well as, later, romance. When I turned the final page I found the opening paragraphs delivered everything they had promised, and more.<br /><br />Set in post-WWII Barcelona, the story takes place over a period of several years, during which the protagonist, young Daniel, is compelled to unravel the mystery surrounding the strange figure bent on destroying his copy, the last copy known to exist, of The Shadow of the Wind, while at the same time coping with the fading memories of his deceased mother as well as his approaching manhood.<br /><br />Perhaps best described as literary fiction, Shadow's characters are all memorable for a host of reasons, while the plot, which at times veers toward melodramatic (perhaps suitable for the period), is engaging. Credit must be given to Lucia Graves for the translation into English, a translation that seems to accurately capture the author's wit, strong narrative and storytelling abilities, and fine eye for detail. Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a gifted writer for his youth, wise beyond his years as many of his characters reveal, and I expect he will have a noteworthy literary career.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000A0GP4K|3.0|Although this film is a must-see for anyone with even the slightest interest in popular culture let alone Dylan-heads, Scorsese has botched the story. Covering only the childhood and first several years of his career, this should have been an easy story to tell: Childhood, hero of acoustic folk, controversial decision to go electric.  But Scorsese has muddied it by plopping, randomly, scenes from Dylan's electric period with fans complaining about it throughout the entire documentary! This happens like 5 times during the film. It is annoying as hell to have this constant negative mantra throughout the film, and gives undo importance to these complaints. It also interrupts and confuses the story he is trying to tell. I've already talked to young viewers who have said it confused them and appeared illogically constructed. I don't blame them; it's probably the worst \\"artistic\\" device I've ever seen in a documentary and it marrs the formative years of his career.  In fact, all you have to do is edit out these 4 or 5 segments (using your VCR or DVD editing equipment) and the documentary flows 100% better and gives a much more positive feel to Dylan's much-heralded acoustic period. (For the record, I prefer Dylan's acoustic period but still don't like hearing fans complain constantly about his entry into electric music.)      Once you get past this directorial faux pas, there is still loads of excellent material in this film. Folk singers Maria Muldaur, Dave Von Ronk, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, and Beat poet Allen Ginsberg are excellent witnesses to the Dylan phenomenon and the whole folk music scene in Greenwich Village in New York City. The Beat poets, the jazz musicians, the bluegrass artists, the influence of past poets-- the whole picture comes alive.  The political consciousness of the folk scene is well represented through the influence of Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and especially through its participation in the civil rights movement.  Liam Clancy, as much an actoras a folk singer, is animated and engaging in his comments, and Joan Baez cracks me up with her dead-on imitation of Dylan.        The switch to electric music is also well told (if only Scorsese had waiting until this moment to begin commentating upon it), and includes film footage of Dylan's infamous appearance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival where he shocked the audience by performing a short electric set.         All in all, it's a superb story about one of America's greatest songwriter, told imperfectly by Scorsese who unecessarily obsesses on acoustic die-hards negavite rants. However, everything else about the film is wonderful.
B000B0WODA|5.0|I love Franz Ferdinand and I first hear about them by reading an article in NME magazine (thank you british press)! Even though some of the bands they praise are not all that great (like treating the members of Oasis like they are gods hahaha!)Well on impulse I brought the debut while I was visiting a family member in California in March 2004 and saw them in concert that September. After my first listen I immediately fell in love w/ the song \\"Walk Away\\" and I also love \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" b/c it is so autobiographical I know that Alex is talking about his ex-lover Eleanor Friedberger of The Fiery Furnaces. The lead single \\"Do You Want To\\" is amazing and  \\"This Boy\\" was played at the concert I attended even though I think there was some rewriting done to the song. I would suggest this album to new and old fans of Franz Ferdinand but the new fans should be warned that there isn't a cloned copy of the bouncy \\"Take Me Out\\" single so if you only are interested or hooked on Franz Ferdinand for or b/c of that song then give the album a couple of more listens before writing a quick review on first impressions.
B00005V9IL|4.0|As a kid, I remember THE ABYSS coming on television one Sunday afternnon.  The image that stayed with me from that brief viewing was the image of Ed Harris, jummping off the ledge into an abyss, measuring more than three miles deep.  I believe that the quote that begins this movie sums up my feelings (and the film's \\"message\\") more than any review can:<br /><br />\\"When you look into the abyss, the abyss looks also into you.\\" Friedrich Nietszche<br /><br />What a frightening thought...and what a frightening movie.  Strangely, however, the film derives its suspense from its story and its characters and not, as one might think in a blockbuster of this type, from the alien encounters that occur throughout the film. I agree with other reviewers: Cameron's message is quite over-the-top, but I don't think the vast majority of this film can be accused of such gratuitousness.  THE ABYSS focuses, centrally, on characters and humanity.  To be sure, the underwater environment provides our characters with plenty of difficulties and stimulus to overcome.  In a way that is similar to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the scenes in which our heroes have to swim underwater, in ice cold conditions, in the silence of the deep ocean, are quite suspenseful. But the special effects merely help enhance the atmosphere created by this film--they support the film, and not the other way around.<br /><br />I found the love story in the film to be quite convincing and real.  Ed Harris does a wonderful job.  I even found myself quite moved during the scene in which the fate of his \\"soon-to-be-ex-wife\\" is unknown.  And when the deep dive of the film occurs, it is the human story that grips us and not the mere fantasy or terror of the unknown.  In some ways, we could not care less about what is down there in the abyss: we simply care if our hero comes back alive.<br /><br />The Special Edition found on this DVD set apparently contains 28 minutes of extra footage.  I have not compared the two versions, but, while long, I did not really feel the Special Edition dragged in any way.  In fact, my only real complaint of the film is the fact that it does not seem to know which story it wants to tell: the human/love story, the human/aggression story, or the alien encounter story.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend THE ABYSS.  Apparently, it was a big failure at the time it came out and I am sure that many brush it off as simply another James Cameron special effects spectacular, compromising story for flash.  But it isn't.  It really isn't.  The special effects are quite superb (you don't feel like you're in 1989, that's for sure).  But they simply help to create a trying atmosphere for our characters to grow and develop in.  And the result: a good story with memorable characters.feel the Special Edition dragged in any way.

B0009I7NNA|2.0|I have never heard of this band until hearing Bat Country (Which is a GREAT song). So I checked them out. All I can say is that thier earlier sound was WAY better. Seems like another hard thrash band has sold out for the duckies....Shame on You!!!! If I never heard thier earlier albums then I would give this one a better rating.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album brings heavy metal and classical music together perfectly. The symphony enhances the electrical guitar, drums, bass, and voice in every song. There is not one song that could not be made any more perfectly then this band and the symphony orchestra did. No matter what mood you are in a particular day you could rock the night away or relax to hearing the orchestra. This album no doubt is the best I ever heard of.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Don't get me wrong. Coldplay is a fantastic band but this is pretty average. Not saying that this is not good album, however, at least for me these songs are just average. I'll admit in two aspects that the songs are pretty pleasing and the songwriting pretty good, almost an atmospheric intensity, with some of these songs especially with \\"Square One\\" and the single \\"Speed of Sound\\". I'm just wishing for the focus that they had when they set the world on fire with \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\". Nothing just seemed to take my breath away here. But all in all, I think this album is somewhat of an aberration to the intensity and focus we have come to expect and love from this British quartet.
0743243153|5.0|This book has helped many people. Its message is that 'Life is difficult' and that we make it more so by running away from our responsibilities and pretending that life cannot be difficult. Peck's prescription for a better life is realizing that life involves a constant effort to understand and improve ourselves. He supplies case- histories of people who seem to have given up or be lost, and then in psychotherapy with him find a way to make better lives. One especially moving story was of a young man who simply could not feel joy at anything in life. He simply had lost his enthusiasm. It turned out that not only had this young man lost a best friend, he had grown up in a world where his two elder brothers knocked down immediately any idea he might have. They tormented him continually and made fun of him. And the parents never paid attention. Peck in two years of psychotherapy was able to teach this young person to stop being fixated at what he was when he was ten years old. He taught the young man how to respect his own thoughts.<br /><br />Peck's message again is of a new psychologyof love, traditional values and spiritual growth.He warns against our tendency to escape from freedom, and to rely on outdated maps of our situation.<br /><br />My sense is that this book has helped so many people in part because so many of us need help. We are continually looking for a message, a word of wisdom or spiritual insight that will help us , and renew our faith in ourselves and life. We are continually looking for a spiritual teacher that will be able to help us.<br /><br />I must admit that this book does not really provide me personally with the kind of message and help I feel a need for at the moment.<br /><br />How I miss my teacher and friend the Holy Teacher Dovid Herzberg who taught by his example a love of people and joy in being with them which lifted up all those who knew him.<br /><br />Scott Peck by this book probably helped thousands maybe even tens of thousands of people. Dovid Herzberg helped tens of people maybe even hundreds. But for me and all those who were blessed to know him, he was the highest of the highest.<br /><br />And helped so so many.erg helped tens of people maybe even hundreds. But for me and all those who were blessed to know him, he was the highest of the highest.  <br />And helped so so many. <br /> <br />
B000002LQR|5.0|So yes, we live in a world where rock fans soak up corporate mess and other bands that thrive on attitude but not necessarily good songwriting. In this case, Blood Sugar Sex Magik would be too intelligent of an album for all of you. It's an album that is a complete microcosm filled with musical styles from hardcore funk metal to New Orleans jazz. It is a different sounding sort of rock and there is a reason why this is the summit for anyone that is a true Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.  <br /> <br />Forget Californication and By The Way. This is the album that gave the Red Hot Chili Peppers something they had lacked for a long time before this -- an identity. Gone were the days of wild drug habits, band engimas, fights with producers, and minimal creative control. This is where four creative and ingenuous musicians -- Anthony Kiedis, Flea, John Frusciante, and Chad Smith.  <br /> <br />There are two things worth noting on this album. Every track was recorded live and was not overdubbed or anything -- you can hear Rick Rubin's voice before \\"The Power of Equality\\" and \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and the crickets chirping at the end of \\"Sir Pyscho Sexy\\" and \\"They're Red Hot\\". In other words, this is how the album was intended to sound without the remastering or anything. The dirt is right there and it makes you feel like you are actually in the studio with them recording these songs in the summer of 1991. Another thing is, each band member wrote their own part of their song, so the creativity behind each of the songs is stronger and the songs sounding more pure. <br /> <br />They always say Anthony Kiedis's lyrics are unintelligent. I highly dispute that...drugs, globalization, sex, life, relationships, attitude, humanity, war, politics, peace, human rights...all of that is discussed in this album. So you tell me if Kiedis cannot write unintelligent lyrics. I don't think unintelligent lyrics are supposed to make you think. <br /> <br />As for the songs, there are absolutely no fillersin this album unlike their later albums. In fact, this is the last album that would not contain fillers in my opinion. It starts off with  <br /> <br />\\"The Power of Equality\\" a politically charged high energy song with Kiedis doing very impressive rapping and Flea delivering a top notch bassline.  <br /> <br />\\"If You Had To Ask\\" is a humorous song about Kiedis's life in L.A.  <br /> <br />\\"Breaking The Girl\\" , which is about broken relationships, is a type of song where their funk meets classical music in a way.  <br /> <br />\\"Funky Monks\\", is a song about every man and woman out there, including themselves. I could not believe John could actually sing that high on chorus, and Flea's suging bassline is the best bassline you will ever hear besides the following song.  <br /> <br />\\"Suck My Kiss\\" is an ode to sex and society and it is impressive how Flea and John combine their instruments to create one sound.  <br /> <br />\\"I Could Have Lied\\" is pretty much the saddest song you will ever hear as it also touches on broken relationships.  <br /> <br />\\"Mellowship Slinky in B Major\\" is all about Kiedis's life as it is very lighthearted and provides a very heavy funked up guitar riff by John.  <br /> <br />\\"The Righteous & The Wicked\\" is another politically charged song as it refers to the Gulf War. John's guitar work is impressive here. Kiedis' vocals add to the dynamics of the song.  <br /> <br />\\"Give It Away\\" is their first number one hit and also amongst the best on this album. The juice harp was pretty well pared with John's guitar and Flea provides a very very addictive bassline. Chad's drumming also helps move the song along pretty well. <br /> <br />\\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" might be their weakest song on the album, but nonetheless still a quality listen. Very erotic guitar by John. Great drumming by Chad. <br /> <br />\\"Under The Bridge\\" is about Anthony's heroin stage forshadows the way they would do ballads for here on out. Comes as a stand still on the album and it is pretty good. Amazingly nearly did not make the album due the fact Anthony originally stashed the lyrics away and Soul To Squeeze was going to be put on here. <br /> <br />\\"Naked In The Rain\\" is pretty much about society and escaping to a utopia. Not one of the more popular RHCP song, it still deserves to be on the album and it is pretty good. Nice bassline by Flea. <br /> <br />\\"Apache Rose Peacock\\" is by far the funkiest and the best song on the album. Being about a girl Anthony saw in New Orleans creatively and allegorically referred to as the apache rose peacock, it features very addictive bassline by Flea and Anthony's random lyrics make it the party on the album. <br /> <br />\\"The Greeting Song\\" is amongst the fastest songs RHCP ever made. A very surging and refreshing ride from start to finish. <br /> <br />\\"My Lovely Man\\" is the ode to Hillel Slovak and features a tearjerking melodical bass play by Flea, followed by as surging solo by John. <br /> <br />\\"Sir Pyscho Sexy\\" is pretty much the dirtiest 5 1/2 minutes you'll ever hear followed by the sweetest 2 1/2 minute instrumental RHCP has ever done. It was to be the original closing to the album. <br /> <br />\\"They're Red Hot\\" was a goof off recorded at 2 AM on the hill outside the mansion they recorded the album. It serves as a funny way to end the album, almost like an throw in scene long after the end of a play. Pretty good. Features Chad playing with only his hands. <br /> <br />It's a great album, I love it, it means the world to me and you should get this album to really know how a real band creates music and creates an album.

B000AMJG4Y|2.0|As a true lover of Final Fantasy VII for Playstation, I was eager to put my hands on this movie and bring back some memories. <br />After having seen the film, I came up to be very disappointed, because of one simple thing: this is not cinema, it's just an exercise of style. <br /> <br />While I do agree with the fact that the graphics and the coreography is somewhat stunning and breathtaking, the music is well done, what truly lacks is the screenplay. <br />If someone has not played FF7 the plot will be totally inconsistent. <br />As I've played it I can say:\\"The plot could be done MUCH MUCH better\\". <br />The story is slow and painfully confusing, there is no true reason for the coming of Sephiroth in the scene (well... the only usephul phrase to understand this is \\"come back into my dreams\\"), the whole plot is almost meaningless. <br /> <br />If I could give an advice to the artists, I'd say this: less computers and more logic.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie is probably the worst piece of trash the media could have come out with! Sorry, that's not good enough, I need to rant some more...<br /><br />I think people actually lose brain cells from watching this dumber than dumb movie. Then everyone around my school had to keep quoting it, probably because this movie comes from the kind of inferior minds that speak their language. I am a big goer for a plot. I like thick, hard to detect plots, for it symbolizes greatness in the work. May I dare say this movie failed to have a plot at all!!! This just followed a nerdy teen and his friend through days of school. I did not seem to find any of the dumb humor funny, and it only kept interest to finish the film only to see if the characters find out their life is worthless. Instead, the movie comes to an abrupt end, with absolutely no intelligent dialect at all and no story throughout. This is just a badly-put together fictional documentary of a nerd, if you take a step back to look at it. I could not believe that people in the movie business would go so low as to forget to put a plot in this story!<br /><br />I'm leaving it at this:<br /><br />There is simply no excuse for this trash. This movie all but sucked to high heaven.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|I will be playing this in whole a number of times this weekend. What I did notice right away is that the sound is probally the best I have ever encountered on a DVD. Listen to Toad and each drum occupies a different space in air. I was disappointed in White Room . Did EC forget his wah wah or what. The solo basically after the song was over while terrific in it's own I would have gladly traded it for the wah wah's. Though much more primitive in it's sound play White Room on the original farewell concert from 35 years ago to hear the difference.Sunshine was great and EC'S voice seems actually better than then while Jack's is aged and not as forcefull. Looking forward to rest of DVD .
B00005QZWI|5.0|Thanks for great response - great product - exact replacement for what had been stolen from us while on vacation!
B00003CXBK|5.0|1.          <br /> <br />I have a brief question to ask all the people who   say this movie is too long. Do you think that all movies that are over 2 and 1/2 hours are too long, or just this one?  <br /> <br />2.            <br /> <br /> To parents who say this movie is not for kids remember that it gets a PG 13 rating (That means 13 and over only) and that you should be screening your kids movies before they watch anyway. (Thats part of the being a good parent thing) <br /> <br />3.              <br /> <br />Many reviewers list the Violence as a negative aspect of this film and yet they list better films to watch wich have more violence or questionable themes. The violence is akin to Lord of the Rings and not akin to Rambo. <br /> <br />4. <br /> <br />The music fits the movie well and changins with the tone and theme when it is required but sometimes I thought it was a bit repetative. <br /> <br />5. <br /> <br />Character development is excelent. Humans rarely change over time so why should we expect movie characters to do the same. <br /> <br />6. <br /> <br />Animation is supurb, even if it is not as polished as other films. <br /> <br />Good Movie! <br />
B000AYEIZY|3.0|First off , just let me say that I am a HUGE fan of  Cream !.....Now with THAT said ; I thought this c.d. was pretty mediocre....Yes, I'm happy that they got back together..and I realize the 37 years that have passed ...but IMO , this sounds more like a really good cover band than actual Cream.....if you want to hear what they sounded like in their PRIME , then I would suggest picking up 'Cream Live Volumes # 1 and 2 ' especially the re-masters....and if you REALLY want to hear what they sound like in TOP form then pick up the 4 c.d. box set ' Those were the days '......I have seen the dvd package of this same album, and my feelings are similar....novelty more than obsession !
B00079HZUM|5.0|This film is really pure entertainment but also a delightful window on Shakespearian theatre in the 17th century.  Its a story of the sexism and disempowerment, of the transience of fame, its a wonderful historical account of a colorful time in history when theatre had the attraction that the internet has today, and its a love story.  But its a love story about one's profession and about unrequited love, and there's plenty in there for straight and gay men alike to enjoy this film.  It's also about competition, admiration, inspiration and friendship.  A truly enjoyable and charming film with a real story line.
1400032717|5.0|At this point, I am sure that you have read the story line of this book so I won't bore you.  This book is so unique and interesting.  It takes a story that is so overdone--parents have problems with their marriage, anger issues, etc.--and makes it interesting and thought provoking.  By taking this story at the angle of an autistic boy, the author is able to tell you a completely different story.  The main character is imperfect but is also in an imperfect world with very human and imperfect parents.<br /><br />I also commend the author for writing a book about a person with special needs with out making them fit a sterotype, feeling sorry for them or being unrealistic about what \\"super\\" things that he can do.  In this book, the lead character is simply trying his best to get through a world that he does not understand.<br /><br />I am the proud mother of a 4 year old autistic book.  Even though this book is fiction, I feel that I have additional insight into my son's world.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Since there have been hundreds of other reviews already written, I will keep my remarks brief. Suffice to say that I found Tim Burton's work with Batman, 1) Self-indulgent (I didn't want Gotham City to be the work of Beetlejuice), and 2)overrated. The script was a travesty, and the second movie wasn't much better. The real tragedy in this is the fact that so many *fantastic* graphic novels have been written for the Dark Knight in the last 20 years, there should have been no shortage of good material. <br /> <br />Finally Nolan gets it right. Borrowing heavily from the superb \\"Batman: Year One\\", we finally understand how a scarred child like Bruce Wayne can become this seemingly unstoppable superhuman legend such as Batman, The Dark Knight. Heck, plenty of people lose a loved one in violent fashion, but what would make a man punish himself to become what Bruce became? Even with great wealth, that isn't easy. Nolan spends about 50% of the movie taking us on that journey, and it is a journey well worth taking. <br /> <br />Those of you looking for constant action in the cape will be somewhat disappointed, but this origin story is extremely well told. Once again, it is proven that even in a superhero movie, a good story well told is worth more than a billion in special effects. We're introduced to many characters that comics fans know and love, Morgan Freeman as Lucious Fox, Liam Neesom as Henri Ducard are two that I suspect will be recurring characters, and Gary Oldman absolutely nails a young Jim Gordon, a character that was totally neglected in the previous Batman movies. <br /> <br />Not only was this a great movie, it sets up the sequels (yes, plural) in a big way.
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends is definetely Radiohead's breakthrough album. It has so many strong tracks on it that its hard for me to choose a favorite. \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" is definetely a classic though. This album is so diverse musically also, it has both songs that rock, and ballads too. \\"Bulletproof...I Wish I Was\\" is probably one of the most depressing radiohead songs out there, I cant deny its power. If you're new to radiohead, you might want to check out the bends first, its radioheads most accessible album.
B000B0WODA|3.0|I really liked Franz's debut, and so I was really hoping this album would be amazing. Sadly, I was wrong. This is just the boringly average follow-up you'd expect from a band like Franz Ferdinand. BUT, if you really, REALLY loved their debut, and want more of the same (along with some Beatles-y ballads and a few added flourishes), then by all means, tack on an extra star or two and buy it. But if you're tired of all this dancepop nonsense flooding currently flooding the scene, skip it.
B00005JOGU|5.0|I caught a sneak preview of Capote at the ArcLight earlier this evening and I have to say: Dammmmnnnnnn!<br /><br />Capote is based on the true story of how Truman Capote, one of America's legendary writers, came to write his masterpiece non-fiction, In Cold Blood--an account on a mass murder that took place in Kansas City on November 15, 1959. The film concentrates on Capote's interaction with the lead killer through the meetings he managed to arrange for them in jail. It explorers how researching the murder affected Capote and changed him forever.<br /><br />The film is remarkable! It captures the late '50s and early '60s impeccably with flawless set dressing and imposed film grain. Capote's interesting life was touched upon with certain aspects highlighted such as his friendship with Harper Lee--author of literary classic To Kill a Mockingbird--and his effiminacy.<br /><br />Philip Seymor Huffman should win an Oscar for his outstanding performance as Truman Capote. His accent, posture, gestures and most subtle inflections were perfection. He definitely delivered the best performance by an actor in a leading role this year thus far.<br /><br />Everyone should see this film! It's a terrific story with stellar performances. It doesn't get better than this.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Well Tom Cruise as a hitman?  Well that's interesting to see him break away from the everyday action hero sanerio he's usally in.  Jamie Foxx not in a comedy?  Oh boy, now this is a risk.  Either it's good ot it's awful.<br /><br />Max(Jamie Foxx) is your everyday cab driver, a honest one for the past 12 years of his services to people.  After his cab drive with Annie(Jada Pickett Smith)  Then comes a guy who's hair is the same color as his suit, Vincint(Tom Cruise).  He gives off some nice loot for a couple of stops that usally cost a lot less, but when a huge puzzle peice as to who Vincint really is lands right in front of Max's face, it's all a rollarcoaster of thrills as to what happens next.<br /><br />This movie does a real good job of keeping the susspence in the movie until the end.  And the fact that Jamie and Tom have proved loyal to their roles dispite typical good guy, and comedy senerios in the past.  Also during the action seenes, they are well directed, and the live style sound effects of the fighting and the gunfights really gets your adreniline rushing during the sceenes.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the end.  A whole bunch a bullets, a whole bunch of misses, only 3 feet apart(Even if it was dark, you could get the jist of where the person was.)<br /><br />Collateral definitly was a huge breakthrough for Jamie Foxx's carrer which got him a oscar nomination.  And after that he got a well deserved best actor award for his extrodinary performance as Ray Charles.  As for Tom, hey, he can finally be the bad guy once in a while which is good to know.  This movie has great suspenction in it, and it also has great action sceenes in it.  Just what to expect from the Director of Heat(Michael Mann).  If you love suspence movies or movies that kick up a good heartracer once in a while, you should definitly check this out. If you have nothing but negative opinions of Ton and Jamie, This might change your mind about these 2 actors who, to me, did good in a excellent movie., or you might be saying what is Michael Mann's pproblem choosing these 2 guys to play lead roles in a movie.  But it should be checked out.<br /><br />Peacedid good in a excellent movie., or you might be saying what is Michael Mann's pproblem choosing these 2 guys to play lead roles in a movie.  But it should be checked out. <br /> <br />Peace
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I was at the Cream concert on Friday 6th May, at which 14 of the 19 numbers on this DVD were filmed, and can confirm that it's a pretty flawless record of the night - sounds the same, looks the same & brilliantly shot - which is just about all you can ask from any DVD of a rock concert.     And how good was it? Just stunning... not only better than you could hope any reunion of Cream could be but one of the best live concerts I've ever seen. Friday was clearly the night to be there - Eric Clapton describes it as the \\"consummate gig\\" in the interviews on the DVD - and it shows. The playing and singing are exceptional and Ginger Baker's drumming is, for a man of 65, quite unbelievable. I was lucky enough to see them play a couple of times in 1966 & 1967 when they were \\"at the peak of their powers\\" and at their farewell concert in 1968, which was a great disappointment, and believe me they didn't play like this. Tight, exciting, powerful and, above all, infused with sheer enthusiasm this is live music at it should be, captured as it was. Forty years on it's quite simply Cream at their very best.
0345363132|3.0|I think Ms. Penman has found her metier with her later books - the medieval mysteries.  <br /> <br />She is without question a scrupulous researcher and a fine historian. But...she tends to unnecessary verbosity and \\"Sunne\\" can be confusing and at times tedious.  <br /> <br />Sandra Worth's  award-winning \\"Rose of York\\" (which covers the same  subject and was recently published) grabbed me from the get-go and I found it to be much more readable, dramatic, and enjoyable than \\"Sunne\\".   Worth's writing skill is sheer brilliance. I never drifted a moment from \\"Rose of York\\" but I found myself repeatedly lost while reading \\"Sunne\\".  <br /> <br />However, with Ms. Penman's medieval mysteries I think she has come into her own. She is masterful in this genre.   <br />
0486440915|5.0|I think this is the best that Jane Austen wrote.  Her characters are so real.  The characters seem to jump off the page.  Anyone who reads this book is in for a treat.  The illustrations enhance what you are reading.  Buy it! Read it! Enjoy it!
6305075492|5.0|This film, as is understood by anybody who takes even a second to research it, is basically the height of German Expressionism.  It is the base of the psyche, an insanity so removed one begins to wonder if the movie is about insanity or if the makers were just insane.<br /><br />A man tells his friend about the story of Dr. Caligari, a demented stranger who enters his town during a carnival with a somnambulist who can divinate the future.  The story traces a murder mystery that treads down contemporarily familiar paths, but the sheer audacity of the sets, costuming, music, and acting makes every moment unpredictable and confusing.<br /><br />The only problem with this German silent great is that a few of the absolutely astounding sets are obviously stages.  Otherwise this movie is perfect.<br /><br />And creepy.  Boy is it creepy.  The characters don't even look real in their shapes and contortions sometimes, more like ventriloquist dummies or marionettes, though who would ever make such marionettes would probably need to be hospitalized.  The music itself is so creepy it could honestly stand alone without the image and some wouldn't even tell the difference.  Actually, it's mostly through the music that we're able to even comprehend what's going on, such is the twisted reality of the world we see.<br /><br />This movie is right on the edge, and it seems any more added to it would have made it topple over.  It's its own fine line between the abyss and security.  A must for fans of the absyrd.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0451450523|5.0|The people that enjoy C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkein, and Ursala LeGuin you will love The Last Unicorn. If you haven't read Peter S. Beagle than you really haven't read enough-in my opinion. His language in and out of the characters comes like cold fire and silken sand paper. It's beauty touches your heart with sudden hands that mold out of thin air. Every character in this novel is completely memorable: equally relatable and tragic. There is glowing redemption in it so if you believe in the will and the power of the human condition you will love this story. I don't need to tell you it's worth the time that you spend with it, any great book helps tell you. Enough said.

B000068PQ0|1.0|I bought this recording (in DVD-Audio form) because it was highly recommended as one of the best ever sounding DVD-Audio disks (TAS).  It was indeed very clear, dynamic, wide frequency response, etc., etc., but since it's all pretty much electronic, it's impossible to judge \\"fidelity\\" to some original.  The music is very candy-like however, and perfectly satisfying on a high end audio system. <br /> <br />But I find the lyrics very disturbing. It seems to be all about war, fighting, etc., and it seems to say that if you don't want that, you're a nobody.  What is this, militaristic candy? <br /> <br />If I want candy, I want sweetness.  If I want thoughts, I want real thoughts, not half-baked nonsense that gets tiring before the first time through.  I generally prefer music without words.  The lyrics in music are almost never as good as the music, even the vocalizing. Often the music is transcendant, while the words are cheap and pedestrian. (Even Beethoven's 9th suffers from this, as I've discovered after reading a translation of \\"Ode to Joy.\\")  In this case, the contrast is extreme, or worse, as I think the words are pure evil, particularly when set with such candy-like music and packaging. <br /> <br />No thanks.  Rather than infect someone else with this garbage, I tossed my $22 DVD-Audio+CD disk set into the trash. <br />
0767834739|1.0|This Paul Anderson is a really funny guy. Every script he puts his hands on turns to crap. OMG this movie was just horrible. Come on people why are yall even giving this guy your money. Movies are not supposed to suck. The more money yall give to this guy the more movies hes going to make. And this it a bad thing BTW.    Don't buy this DVD or rent it. The first R.E. was good but could of been better. But this one is OMG just horrible. Lets just hope that the next R.E. movie going to have a diffrent movie director.    Just pass on this one, OK!!!
B000002U82|5.0|This is the best music, the best recording, the best rock album, the best concept album.  It nails everything, the music, the spellbinding performance, the spacious recording, incredible solos, and even the lyrics (and I usually don't like lyrics, as you might tell from my other reviews).
B0009SOFGI|2.0|Let me say first that Fun House by The Stooges is on my Top 10 CD list. And Raw Power is right up there. Plus I love Iggy Pop. And I listen to lots and lots of different music. Bought this mainly for consistency's sake. Bit of advice if you haven't heard Funhouse, get this first and work your way to Funhouse. If you get way into Funhouse first, this album will be a real big let down. Actually, do yourself a favor, download I Wanna Be your Dog, Real Cool Time, and Little Doll from iTunes or something. The rest of the tunes on this album are pretty bad and irrelevant. Then go buy the Rhino remastered Funhouse and Iggy's remix of Raw Power. The difference between this album and Funhouse sounds like two different bands. They can hardly play their instruments on this album and Iggy sounds pretty tame. Some of the solos are just god awful. Sorry, but Funhouse just rules The Stooges roost.
B000AYEIZY|1.0|Although the track listings on both Amazaon and the Cream 2005 site describe this CD set as being the complete show, IT IS NOT - \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" has been dropped.  Why - who can guess?  There is plenty of room on the CDs, and there is a very good recording of the song on the DVD, but for reasons known only to themselves the record company decided to omit this number.  [...]  This release is a disgrace.  I wish I could give it zero stars.
B0002EXH4K|4.0|Most of the people I knew looked at Megadeth as a bad or over-rated band. I got the tape for this album so I know nothing of the bonus tracks. I listened to the tape front to back and I liked it. I can't say that I loved it because I didn't. The singer wasn't great, but that's really my only complaint. I would say Megadeth is actually under-rated because not many people of this generation have heard of them. The Megadeth guitarest is completely off the hinges. The guitar solos were really great. The rhythms to every song were original and good. I think Megadeth is something more people should be looking into. Especially fans of 70s and 80s rock.
0740748475|5.0|The strip in question is from 25 November 1988.  The original dialogue goes like this: <br /> <br />CALVIN: Watch out, Mom. I'm in a bad mood. <br />MOM: Be in a bad mood somewhere else, OK? I'm busy. <br />CALVIN: Hmph! I'll bet my biological mother would've bought me a comic book and made me feel better instead of shunning me like you. <br />MOM: Kid, anyone but your biological mother would've left you to the wolves long ago. <br />CALVIN: Yeah right. Really, how much did you pay for me? <br /> <br />In the Complete C&H, however, the phrase 'my/your biological mother' is changed to 'a good mother,' and Calvin's final bit of dialogue has been altered to: 'Yeah, right. Let's see your training certificate.' <br /> <br />Since Bill Watterson exercises strict control over the strip, clearly the edit was his.  Why?  I don't know, but I can make a pretty good guess: The original language is insensitive to adoptive families.  It implies that biological parents/children have a bond that adoptive parents/children don't.   <br /> <br />Why would this matter to Bill?  Maybe he's got friends who adopted, or maybe he did.  Look at the dedications in the book.  The last dedication made by Bill is to his wife and .... who?  <br />Bill is 47 now.  He didn't have a kid when the strip was running, even though he was married.  Perhaps he and his wife adopted.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I found this movie generally annoying.  It was shot beautifully, the sets are really cool and comic book-like, and special effects were not bad.  However, the story was very cliche and I really didn't care for any of the characters.  I felt like it went on for hours and hours and nothing really happened.  However, the one big plus for lovers of the female body is that there was no shortage of scantily clad hot-bodied women, and, of course, Jessical Alba in chaps.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Do you remember the first time you saw \\"Star Wars?\\" How'd you feel afterwards? Like George Lucas had been following you around, making notes about what you read, what you watched, what you loved? Like he'd interviewed your friends, your relatives, checked with Santa about your Christmas wish lists? Do you remember how many people you dragged back to the theatre, over and over, converting all your friends like some demented Jedi missionary? Do you remember how you waited for \\"Return of the Jedi\\", how you wrote letters about how it shouldn't be named \\"Revenge of the Jedi\\" and you stood in line for tickets for 3 days? How long's it been since you felt that way? Yeah, you're in your 40's now, you've got a 40-hour-a-week job that you spend 70 hours a week doin', your wife wants you to wallpaper the bathroom, your kids are away at college buying I-Pods with their book money, it just cost you $70 to have your dog's teeth cleaned and all you wanna do is feel like you did back then.    Well, this is your lucky day, my friend; you have a chance to relive that experience. Joss Whedon has brought you an early Christmas present called \\"Serenity.\\" You've heard of Joss; \\"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,\\" \\"Angel\\" and a little series on Fox called \\"Firefly.\\" That last was a special kind of show; great writing, a tight cast, a haunting score and a story line that made all the other sc-fi you'd seen lately seem like episodes of \\"Meet the Press.\\" Fox did their best to kill it; they refused to show the pilot, they showed episodes out of order, they pre-empted it and then abandoned it with 3 episodes left unaired. Like 40 or 50 other Fox shows in recent years, it was dead.    But it wasn't dead. The fans, Browncoats, as they call themselves, immediately started writing letters, making phone calls, posting messages on sc-fi web sites and blogs, all in an effort to save the show. That, and Joss wouldn't quit. He told the cast they were cancelled and, almost in the same breath, told them not togive up, that he'd find them a home. Together they made enough noise that Fox decided to release the series on DVD, figuring that'd shut the fans up and they could go back to putting quality shows on the air like \\"The Simple Life.\\" But, then, DVD sales just took off. Word spread, mostly fan to fan. People began having DVD viewing parties, buying DVDs for friends, setting up booths at sci-fi conventions to promote the show and the DVDs with no help from Fox. You see, they loved the show and it's characters and the folks who gave them life so much that they were willing to do the promotion Fox wouldn't spring for. And, they made enough noise (and bought enough DVDs) that they got the attention of Universal Studios who, perhaps remembering Star Trek and the above mentioned Star Wars, decided to spring $40,000,000 for a movie.    It was money well spent. \\"Serenity\\" is everything the series and the above mentioned franchises were, and much more. Mr. Whedon, being simply the most eloquent script writer on the planet, has given the film a story line that not only satisfies (at least, temporarily) the Fireflyistas, it's a knock down, kick butt film in it's own right.    The plot: Five hundred years in the future, Earth has become uninhabitable, and the human race has moved on to a new solar system made up of dozens of terraformed planets. There is a bloody civil war between the government of the inner core of planets, known as the Alliance, and a rag-tag collaboration of independents, who populated the outer planets and call themselves Browncoats. The Alliance, of course, prevails. A few years later Malcom Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a veteran of the losing side, scrapes by as the captain of a Firefly-class ship, Serenity, named after the location of the battle which ended the war. With a crew comprised of the only other survivor of Reynolds' platoon, Zoe (Gina Torres), a wise cracking pilot and Zoe's husband, Wash (Alan Tudyk), a young tomboy mechanic, Kaylee (Jewel Staite)and a mercenary who would sell out his mother to the highest bidder, Jayne (Adam Baldwin), Mal takes any job, legal or not, particularly if he can stick it to the Alliance in the process. When they take on two passengers, a young doctor and his sister, they get more than they bargained for. The doctor, Simon (Sean Maher), rescued his sister, River (Summer Glau), a psychic, from an Alliance research facility where she was the subject of experiments aimed toward...well, we're still not quite sure. River, still recovering from her experience, is being pursued by a ruthless Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), sent by the Alliance to retrieve their \\"property\\".    In the hands of another writer or director this could easily have deteriorated into one of those horrible, clichd Sci-Fi Channel movie-of-the-week monstrosities (You know, the ones that always seem to star David Keith or the latest hunk from some WB network teen drama) or a low budget throwaway designed to ride the coat tails of the latest chapter of the \\"Star Wars\\" franchise (Think \\"Spacehunter: Adventures In The Forbidden Zone\\"). But an excellent script and a cast that have to rely on talent rather than name recognition make this movie so much more than the sum of it's parts. The film is built on story and subtle attention to detail, it doesn't rely on over-the-top special effects or unstoppable blood-sucking aliens. (In Joss's vision of the future, the monsters are all too human.)    It's to Mr. Whedon's credit that this film is able to stand on it's own as a truly great example of the genre, not just as an addendum to an abandoned television series. See it now. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer, you'll tell your friends and drag 'em to the theatre and wait in line three days for the sequel. You'll regain your youth. And the next coat you buy just might be a bit brown...
B000025XX0|4.0|Queen is, without a doubt, one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time (in my opinion, they're the greatest). As with all great bands, there is an unseemly amount of greatest hits collections in Queen's vast catalogue. In 1991, ten years fater their first greatest hits collections was released, the second Queen compialtion was released, entitled \\"Greatest Hits, Vol. 2\\". It chronicled all their European hits from 1981 to 1991. How does it hold up read on?<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-If you're only a fan of Queen's later work, than this collection is ideal. All the later hits are here including \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"Under Pressure\\", \\"I Want To Break Free\\", \\"I Want It All\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\".<br /><br />-The songs sound good.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />-No \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\". I would have gladly dumped \\"Friends Will Be Friends\\" or \\"One Vision\\" for that song.<br /><br />-Nothing from their early years (though it's kind of a given)<br /><br />-Hard to locate.<br /><br />-It's available as a two cd collection, coupled with the first hits collection entitled \\"Greatest Hits Vols. 1 & 2\\"<br /><br />Overall: Good collection. Too bad it isn't sold separately any more.
B0007QJ1MK|2.0|if you guys really want to hear the real qotsa i would much rather recommend you listen to \\"rated R\\" than either songs for the deaf or this one. i even liked them better when josh played in kyuss, but now they are just another washed up MTV band like all the rest!!

0812550706|1.0|God almighty, I had to read this fantasy scifi book for a book club, and I'm lucky I didn't strangle myself.  To start, fantasy isn't my cup of tea, but I decided to give it a chance.  Afterall, I'm a proponent of the \\"no contempt prior to investigation\\" movement.  Halfway through, I realized I had no idea what the hell this thing was trying to tell me.  Some six year old kid freezing computer bodies while adults explain to him in adult terms the reason he's so important.  Wait a minute!  Unless a hundred years from now preteens are a thousand times brighter than their counterparts today, no way this kid is going to understand anything the guy tells him.  Hell, I didn't understand what the guy was talking about.  It was excruciatingly painful from beginning to end.  Frustrated, I called a friend in the club and she said \\"hang on to the end, there's a real surprise.\\"  So, good soldier that I am, I did.  But I didn't find the surprise (...).  Couldn't stand this read.  Dreadful!!!!!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Move over RadioHead - you've met your match.  This band is amazing.  I love Stockholm Syndrome and Time is Running Out.  Melodic Harmonies....LOVE IT!!!!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Its 2005, and after two quite dull albums (in my opinion), Dream Theater unleashes an amazing prog album once again that completely surpasses my expectations.  I was quite disappointed with Train of Thought and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, but this album is just great, so atmospheric and emotional, its great. <br /> <br />1. The Root Of All Evil: Continuing Mike Portnoy's alcoholism saga, this is probably my favorite of the three.  Very catchy, and awesome melodies through the verse and chorus.  A great introduction to the cd with a very energetic song. <br />Rating: A <br /> <br />2. The Answer Lies Within: I usually skip this song, it seems so boring.  I feel as if theres nothing catchy or anything in this song to make it stand out. <br />Rating: C <br /> <br />3. These Walls: Now here is a catchy song.  Great keyboard performed by Jordan Rudess (who in my opinion finally pulls a good performance) along with a very atmospheric song.  Great vocals by Labrie and an overall good song. <br />Rating: A <br /> <br />4. I Walk Beside You: Can anyone say U2?  I think that says enough for me. <br />Rating: C+ <br /> <br />5. Panic Attack: KILLER song, I can definitely hear some Iron Maiden and a tiny bit of Muse influence in parts of this song.  Really fast paced, really heavy, and once again very atmospheric.  Great keyboard solo in this one. <br />Rating: A- <br /> <br />6. Never Enough: Now this is the song with a bunch of Muse influence. I find it to be average, some of the parts of the song I don't quite like that much, but some parts are great as well.  A fairly decent song, worthy of a listen. <br />Rating: B <br /> <br />7. Sacrificed Sons: Probably the most emotional song on the album featuring great vocals, melodies, and atompshere.  I can feel a lot of power coming from this song, and although the message it covenes may be hackneyed (9-11), the song itself is definitely not.  I love the lyrics in the chorus \\"Who would do this to our people?  And proclaim that his will done?....\\" Brilliant. <br />Rating: A <br /> <br />8. Octavarium: The albums epic-of-all-proportions closer, in my opinion the best song on the album.  By far the most atmospheric in the album, regardless of how bad the intro may be ripped from Pink Floyd, I still love it.  Just a brilliant song with some brilliant parts.  In my opinion, the outro solo is John Petrucci's best EVER.  Amazing. <br />Rating: A+ <br /> <br />Overall, I highly suggest this album to any prog fan, a great album.
B000000W5L|5.0|I ignored this record when it was released back in 72.  I can't really say why other than the bad boy image was annoying.  I had no interest in this band.  Anyway, a couple of weeks ago I started thinking about this record after seeing some brokerage advertising with the Stones on stage.  I looked over the reviews here and the review below \\"A Place, not a CD\\" convinced me to pick this up.  That reviewer is absolutely correct and I'm not going to wax on (no pun intended) about every detail of this record.  This is a \\"beefy stew\\" of deep blues ala John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Skip James, Robert Johnson, the voodoo of Dr John, gospel, \\"red-neck\\" rock and real country music.  For those familiar with the music of Tom Waits, it would be hard to believe his works such as Swordfish Trombone and Rain Dogs were not at least partially influenced by this record (listen to \\"Just Want to See His Face\\" and try not to think of Tom Waits)<br /><br />Every track is a treasure - no tempation to hit the skip button on the player whatsoever. There are no hits here other than Tumbling Dice and Happy. Somehow I doubt these charted all that well back in the day...  Who cares?<br /><br />I have one small but meaningful criticism of this record.  The producer Jimmy Miller blew it.  This is such an authentic piece of Americana, raunchy country-folk-blues that the studio fades at the end of each song are somewhat annoying (or disappointing).  They should have put a proper finish on each tune to add to its authentic down home sound.  That's a small gripe given how truly great this CD is.  I can live with it.<br /><br />I really love this record and I'm glad I purchased it.  Buy it, but don't expect hit single type material. It's way better than a bunch of attempts at hit singles.<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT:  3 weeks later - I can't get the darn thing out of my CD Player!  I can't stop playing it!  I LOVE this CD!  And I'm not even a Stones fan!<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT:  3 Months later - It is still getting heavy rotation and it was this release that drove me to start snatching up the Stones remasters. This really is THAT good. It is worthy of every syllable of hype you may have heard.  If you've read any of my other reviews, you know that I am reticent to call anything \\"the greatest\\" and I hesitate to do so now; however, I am going to go out on a limb and proclaim this to be one of maybe 1/2 dozen of the very best releases of the 70's decade.  I really don't think that's a stretch at all.  No wonder the subsequent releases such as Goats Head Soup fail to provide as much satisfaction.  You want satisfaction?  Pick up Exile on Main Street.  By the way, I have since learned that Tom Waits has a celebrity top 10 list here on Amazon.com.  Exile on Mainstreet is #4 on his list :) Fabulous, simply fabulous.<br /><br />Four Months Later:  Still getting heavy rotation along with Johnny Winter And Live and Mayall's Bluesbreakers with Clapton. Exile is probably one of the 5 best recordings I have purchased since 1967 - no foolin'.  Anyone who calls this \\"over-rated\\" is just musically ignorant.<br /><br />About a Year Later:  Not as much rotation but still consider this to be one of the best CDs in my collection and definitely the best thing the Stones ever laid down on tape.release that drove me to start snatching up the Stones remasters.

B0007XT7V8|4.0|In the 3 years it took for theory of a deadman to complete and release \\"gasoline\\" (their follow-up to \\"theory of a deadman\\"), you'd think the band would have gone through some musical changes. Well, they did, and they didn't. With \\"self-titled\\", it was hard to argue the blatant similarities to nickelback, both musically and lyrically. I personally remember thinking that it was almost as if Chad and the boys were channeling their sound through theory. Don't get we wrong now, I still think it's their best release to date, but it was refreshing to hear theory come to their own on \\"gasoline\\". While this record still carries the radio-rock formula that made nickelback and co. so famous, it has other, different elements to it as well. More acoustic songs, strings and even some country-rock tracks set \\"gasoline\\" apart from it's peers. Produced by Howard Benson (hoobastank, cold, P.O.D), \\"gasoline\\" has a more pop-friendly sound than it's former, and could easily get play on top 40 FM.     The album opens up with two strong tracks called \\"Hating Hollywood\\" and \\"no way out\\", with the second being about religion, something new for theory. Although theory themselves have never openly admitted to being religious or not, you can pretty much determine their faith through the lyrics; \\"your god ain't much of a know it all\\".       Things move right along with the band's first single \\"no surprise\\", a country rock song with a pop-friendly chorus. \\"Quiver\\" is another solid track, which is here and gone in under 3 minutes, and sets the tone well for \\"Santa Monica\\", the album's highlight acoustic song. Although many fans claim this track to be their favorite, I'd have to say I'm more partial to the later songs.     Half way through we have \\"better off\\" and \\"say goodbye\\". \\"better off\\" isn't really the greatest song ever written, but it does have a good chorus and some catchy riffing. \\"say goodbye\\" follows the same formula as \\"the last song\\" (see \\"theory of a deadman\\" track 7), with a complicated  acoustic intro and a huge, dynamic sound.       \\"Hello lonely\\" is my personal favorite on the record. Here, Tyler's vocals seem to shine the brightest, and there's no denying that his song writing has never been better. \\"me and my girl\\" brings the album back to it's hard rock sound, with a nu-metal like intro and a soaring chorus.  This could be the heaviest theory song ever recorded, keeping in mind that theory was never that heavy to begin with.     The last four songs are a real mixed bag. \\"since you've been gone\\" and \\"in the middle\\" rank as second and third place favorites behind \\"hello lonely\\". I can't say the same for the other two. Honestly, I don't think I would have cried if \\"save the best for last\\" wasn't included, and \\"hell just ain't the same\\" proves that even major label acts still like to include a filler here and there. Luckily, these tracks fall right in between two of the best ones, so you can easily listen to the record all the way through.     I guess it goes without saying that if you're not a fan of nickelback, or radio-rock in general, theory of a deadman's \\"gasoline\\" won't be high on your list of favorites. However, if you're a fan of bands like 3 doors down, hoobastank and of course, nickelback, give these guys a shot. They might just turn into your new favorite band. Although I personally enjoyed the debut more, \\"gasoline\\" is a more commercially appealing release, and a perfect place to start if you're new to the band.  I look forward to hearing more from theory in the future, and hopefully next time around they'll experiment even more and give us an altogether different sound.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first heard about Firefly I thought, What? A space-western?  But by the time I had seen 2 episodes I was lamenting the fact that there were only 12 more to watch.  The cast is amazing, each playing there roles flawlessly, each so straightforward and yet having unplumbed depths. There was so much potential in this series, so many tales that beg to be told, but Fox killed that all.  I never even heard of Firefly while it was on TV, but now it is the first TV series that I have bought on DVD.  I even saw the movie.  Both it and this are totally worth your money!
B000AL730Y|5.0|Con ms de 40 aos de vida artstica, y con todos los logros y xitos obtenidos,  a estas alturas, haga lo que haga Sir Macca, lo puede hacer sabiendo que  no tiene nada que perder ni nada que lisonjear, pero como ya es costumbre en l, siempre se las ingenia para sorprendernos dentro de su convencionalismo, mostrarse vigente y con muchas ideas creativas.    Chaos And Creation es el primero en estudio desde el Driving Rain (2001), en el cual toca la mayora de los instrumentos  de cuerda, vientos, teclados y percusin; de los trece temas, cuatro de ellos son ejecutados totalmente por l, tan igual como lo hiciera en McCartney I - su debut como solista- y en el McCartney II. Adems, hay un elemento fundamental: la presencia de Nigel Godrich como productor -quien ha trabajado con  Radiohead, Travis y Beck-, cuya produccin no sobrecargada, ha logrado sonidos lozanos y agradables sin llegar a ser melifluos.    En Fine Line, tanto el piano como la batera crean un ambiente rock-pop festivo para una voz que suena joven a pesar de  sus 63 aos, de una de las estrofas sale una parte del ttulo del disco: \\"There is a long way between chaos and creation If you don't say wich one of these you're gonna choose...\\"(hay un largo camino entre el caos y la creacin si no dices cual de estos vas a escoger...). En How Kind Of You, el tpico, es la desesperanza total que logra superarse cuando uno encuentra a alguien con quien contar de verdad, unos loops de piano y guitarra completan el ambiente melanclico. La  acstica Jenny Wren, es considerada  \\"la hija\\" de Black Bird  con algunas pinceladas de Mother Nature's Son, ests dos ltimas del White Album de los Beatles,  los acordes son enriquecidos enormemente por el sonido clave de un duduk (una especie de clarinete), que le da otro matiz al estilo McCartniano del tema.     At The Mercy,  Too Much Rain, Follow Me y This Never Happened Before son los surcos ms convencionales, pero acaudalados con arreglos de cuerdas que les dan toques novedosos, destacando la ltima en mencin, por el sentimiento con que es cantado, el piano preciso y una letra simple pero muy del corazn, que hacen de ella una de sus mejores baladas de los ltimos 15 aos, \\"I'm very sure, this never happened to me before, I met you and now I'm sure this never happened before. Now I see this is the way it's supposed to be, I met you and now I see this is the way it should be\\" (Estoy muy seguro, esto nunca antes me haba pasado, te encontr y ahora estoy seguro que esto nunca antes sucedi. Ahora veo que esta es la manera  en que tena que darse, te encontr y ahora veo que esta es la manera en que sera).    Friends To Go, fue compuesta segn su autor, con una ayudadita de la \\"energa\\" de George Harrison, las principales notas son tocadas con una acstica, pero tambin se puede apreciar un rasgueo cortado de guitarra elctrica -que le da ms sustaine- y  por momentos una segunda voz muy oportuna. Lo ms rockero, lo encontramos en Promise To Your Girl, cuyo solo guitarresco  reemplaza muy bien al cantante, de esta lrica sale la otra parte del ttulo del disco: \\"Looking through the backyard of my life, time to sweep the fallen leaves away\\"(Mirando a travs del patio trasero de mi vida, tiempo para barrer las hojas que caen).    Pasemos a las canciones ms destacadas, en English Tea, el inicio con violn seguido de  un squito de cuerdas con una flauta al medio, acompaan de manera premeditada el homenaje con tonos sarcsticos que Macca hace de algunas tradiciones inglesas. A Certain Softness sobresale por sus arreglos, amn de una mezcla de bossa nova y bolero. Riding To Vanity Fair, que trata del fin de una amistad, es el ms sombro, con  unos sonidos de vasos de cristal que nos van transportando con la mente  a diversos lugares   que se van creando con el ambiente de la cancin. En el ltimo track, Anyway, l termina hablando de su \\"nuevo concepto\\" del amor: \\"If our love is strong enough, it may never end\\" (Si nuestro amor esbastante fuerte , es posible que nunca termine), luego de algunos segundos de silencio, asoma un hidden track instrumental de  3 minutos que muestra su lado menos convencional, con una perfecta suite, compuesta de melodas dismiles entre si, empalmadas magistralmente por la dupla McCartney-Godrich .    Para los coleccionistas, la edicin especial viene con un DVD que contiene un documental sobre cmo se hizo el lbum -donde se menciona que Godrich fue recomendado por George Martn y que en ocasiones tuvo que ser el crtico ms implacable de Sir Paul, cuando ste ltimo no lograba, por momentos, darle a sus canciones la trascendencia de su figura-,  un video de la performance en estudio del single hit Fine Line y unas imgenes con movimiento de cmara que muestran los trazos y  dibujos que se han incluido en el pequeo libro del disco.    Aqu tenemos un lbum que apuesta a ganador y que sale vencedor, gracias a la simbiosis Macca-Godrich, se nota la mano del joven productor, que ha revitalizado las canciones, hacindolas frescas y atractivas, con muestras de mucha juventud amalgamadas con el genio creativo y virtuoso del ex beatle, quien ha demostrado tener cuerda para rato, an cuando lo escuchemos cantar \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\".

B000005YZM|3.0|When you're into British Sixties Rock, you know the Greatest Four: The Beatles, The Who, The Stones and (my personal faves) The Kinks.  Plus many more rhythm&blues and rock'n'roll outfits, such as Animals, Manfred Mann, Yardbirds. Diggin' to them you'll find the name Zombies on your way. And many many many audio-60s-philes could say you, that Zombies is one of the best rock bands of that era. And underrated one. <br />Album called \\"Odessey & Oracle\\" often presents in boring \\"Top 500 all-time albums\\"-listing in rock zines. Don't be fooled - if you buy this, you'll hear something really different from standard British ROCK sound. You'll hear the POP sound, much more similar to the late Beach Boys and McCartney-side of the Beatles, than to the Who or the Kinks. It's a pop music with no revolutionarity of rock and roll and even without \\"mind opening\\" of psychedelic freaks. <br />And the worst thing - melodies are good, but nowhere great enough to be covered... eehhh... by disco or punk band, for example. Early Zombies' single \\"She's Not There\\" greatly covered by UK Subs. And it's Zombies' only really hooking single. <br />I think of late Zombies just like about Beach Boys/Sgt Peppers pleasant, joyful, but not exciting followers. Not more.  <br />This is not album of All-time-top-200. Good, but not great in any point. Too polished and too predictable to break your mind apart.

B0001XAPX8|3.0|This movie would have been wonderful if the focus was on Coleman's flashbacks to his college years, not on the jumbled-up present of his life.  While the segments with Nicole Kidman's character drag on, the flashbacks present a wonderful picture of what it was like to be of a racially mixed background during racial tumultuous times.  Wentworth Miller is wonderful as the young Coleman Silk (a role that should have given him more movie clout), and Anna Deveare Smith is stoic and touching as Silk's mother.  Gary Sinise and Ed Harris shine in their present-day roles, but Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman are by far the weakest links in this movie.  Or, perhaps, their characters are by far the weakest links.
B000021Y77|4.0|Lola receives a frantic phone call form her boyfriend. He will be killed by his gangster bosses in twenty minutes if he doesn't come up with one hundred thousand deutsche marks, the amount he lost in a botched money transfer. So Lola runs, literally, into the streets of Germany, hoping to find means to the money in twenty minute's time.<br /><br />Lola is sweet, worldly and young and so is her boyfriend. They need be, to gain our sympathy against the common but evil financier status quo of Europe. Their attempt to beat the clock against an impossible task, is the one and only subject matter of the film. The story, or idea, is told in a fast paced, rock video style narrative, part light humor, part sharp suspense, with lightning strike synonymous time frames of the same characters and situations, projecting Lola's stressed mental state of adrenaline rushed physical endurance and high powered decision making.<br /><br />By the time Lola starts out on her third attempt to save the day, (it's the charmer), you might begin to wonder  how the film will pull itself out of it's self-imposed infinity, as it flails deep into a hole of pretense tempting filmmaking and already dated Euro-trash musical score. But it does, as happily as an adult, lust rewarding fairy tale. While we view a detailed visual feast of a gothic German metropolis as backdrop,  it is the sight of the shapely, but not particularly athletic Lola running that captures our attention. Indeed, there is a lady or a tiger at the end of this road, or in this case, a pot o' eurodollars or certain death. Like a modern day 'Diana and the Golden Apples', our heroine radiates stamina and endurance and beauty as she runs down yet another crooked path. So run, Lola, run. You'll shed those few extra pounds yet.

B0009WFFS6|3.0|Greetings:<br /><br />I have been an enthusiastic Cream fan since their debut album Fresh Cream way back when. So, you can imagine the excitement I felt when I heard that Cream was finally going to reform for a limited number of concerts at the Albert Hall-exactly where they left off.<br /><br />Whether the reunion reason was for finance replenishment for Jack and Ginger, or a real burning desire to play in public one more time is irrelevant. What is important, is the end result of three seasoned musicians putting on a concert after so many years of isolation from the public as a group.<br /><br />From a entertainment view, seeing these three groundbreaking musicians on the same stage; interacting again is reason enough to see them as well as buy this DVD.<br /><br />From a musical perspective, I think the DVD of the concert proved that \\"you can't go back\\".<br /><br />I found the entire performance and intensity extremly lackluster and in some points (Toad especially-and I am a huge Baker fan)boring enough to skip over to the next song. Pressed Rat ... was better left in the closet. Surprising enough even with the words written down in front of him, Baker still omitted the last part of the vocals.<br /><br />The musical interchanges in terms of changing the songs tempo and then going back to the original tempo; a facet of Cream that made them amazing virtuosos, were totally nonexistent.<br /><br />The fire, intensity and musical risks taken within a song,displayed in the original Cream live shows, were just not there. It was a safe concert.They could have been a Cream cover band if you closed your eyes.<br /><br />In the interview segment Jack said \\"this is the way we play now\\". How right he was.Listening to these Cream songs played now, and remembering how they were played in the 60's was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />The reunion was an interesting idea, and I'm sure that a \\"ton of money\\" will be made on this tour.But personally, I think they waited too long to reform. A Cream reunion during the late 80's-early 90's would have been a different show entirely.<br /><br />Baker and Bruce at this point, have the desire and enthusiasm to put on a good show but at their advanced age, I suspect time has taken a toll on their physical tools to entertain in the way that made them famous.<br /><br />After watching and listening to this DVD, it is obvious that this reunion was better left to a polished studio album.<br /><br />As McCartney has said about a Beatles Reunion-\\"you can't reheat a souffle\\".<br /><br />Evidently Baker,Bruce and Clapton did, and it burned.<br /><br />Hopefully, the Madison Square Garden Concerts will fare better for Cream as well as the audience.e late 80's-early 90's would have been a different show entirely.  <br />Baker and Bruce at this point, have the desire and enthusiasm to put on a good show but at their advanced age, I suspect time has taken a toll on their physical tools to entertain in the way that made them famous. <br />After watching and listening to this DVD, it is obvious that this reunion was better left to a polished studio album. <br />As McCartney has said about a Beatles Reunion-\\"you can't reheat a souffle\\". <br />Evidently Baker,Bruce and Clapton did, and it burned. <br />Hopefully, the Madison Square Garden Concerts will fare better for Cream as well as the audience.  <br />
0440237688|1.0|That's all there is. This book is nothing more than a watered-down kiddie version of 1984. It uses the same central theme--disallusionment of \\"the system\\", rebellion against \\"the system\\", and the ultimate breaking of the disallusioned.  <br /> <br />The story is slow (and painful, if you've read any other society-gone-to-hell pieces), the characters are bland. Heck, the only reason Jonas and the Giver are any bit interesting is that Lowry seems to have fashioned them off of Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Hearing her on the radio doesn't compare to seeing--and hearing-- her live!  I got to see Christina when she and Justin did their \\"Justified/Stripped\\" tour in Chicago two years ago (in July) on my birthday.  What a present!!  I liked Christina more than Justin, if you really wanted to know.  And boy, did she put on a show!<br /><br />She truly deserves the title of a diva, because with \\"Stripped,\\" she proved that she can be versatile...and that makes for a long and prosperous career.  I even remember hearing Britney say in an interview that she wished that she had Christina's voice!<br /><br />I bought this CD long before I went to that concert, and just liked every song. My personal favorite tracks are \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\", \\"Fighter\\", both the interlude and the song \\"Lovin' Me for Me\\", of course \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Dirrty\\", \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Make Over\\", \\"Soar\\" and \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\".  I just love the whole album, and there's no point in just rattling off all the titles.<br /><br />If this is Christina being for real, then heck, I can't wait to hear more!  I remember hearing Christina say in an interview, saying that she grew up.  From what she shows in her videos, and in the material she wrote out, I'd say that she definitely did!

B0000DD7LC|5.0|After her debut album, I waited.  And waited.  I had to see if she'd pass the \\"sophomore slump.\\"  Pass it?  Heck, she blew it out of the water too many times over!<br /><br />Her enigmatic personality is what keeps everyone guessing, even if the music you hear from her now is the music that could've seamlessly played some 25-30 years ago--and you wouldn't have even known the difference!  She is truly a genius, and Timbaland and Kanye West are as well, understanding her need to keep it fresh, but old-school.<br /><br />I wonder if anyone ever called her an \\"old soul\\" to her face, because she truly is, and this album reflects that more so than her debut.  If she keeps this up, she'll have a long, lustrous life ahead of her.  Maybe that's why she was so confident.  She did her own thing, worked hard for what she wanted, and isn't looking back--and doesn't regret what she did or didn't do.  Although I have to agree that she may be one of the most commercial artists of the neo-soul scene, she also proves that she can take a little risk in collaborating with other artists so that she can't afford to get \\"stalled\\" in her own creativity.<br /><br />Of course, we'll never hear all of Alicia's diary entries--she'll let you see what she wants you to see, and it's always from a distance, like a story that's being told to you.  If she was in these positions herself, you'd never know it from the songs on her CD.  The only thing that we all know is that we keep clamoring for more--and that, my friends, is the secret to her success.  My favorite tracks: \\"Karma\\", \\"Heartburn\\", \\"You Don't Know My Name\\", \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" (those two songs went on to radio overkill), \\"Diary\\", \\"So Simple\\", \\"Wake Up\\", and \\"Nobody Not Really\\".<br /><br />She is a truly gifted songwriter, musician, and artist.  Keep us groovin', Alicia!  Although you are not revolutionizing R&B, you are bringing it back to the basics, and make old-school music sound like new again.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was really suprised by the quality of this album when I listened to it all the way through. Yeah, I heard the fantastic _Wake Me Up Inside_ and the tender _My Immortal_ many times on the radio. This album has an edge to it. Amy Lee sings as if she is screaming in anguish (as in emotional pain). The guitar parts by Ben Moody are pure Rock and are excellent. This is really an album to sink your teeth into. I can't recommend it enough. 5 stars!

The three major songs, \\"Hell's Bells\\", \\"Back in Black,\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" have become anthems for AC/DC fans throughout the world. Just three simple cords and some straight forward lyrics have sold millions of copies. It is no wonder that it is one of the best selling albums in history.

B000A6T1JU|1.0|After almost a year of anticipation, the trumpeted \\"ultimate director's cut\\" of the beloved 1979 camp classic arrived - and it made George Lucas's belated Star Wars reeditions, with their already proverbially inane \\"Greedo shooting first\\" and \\"Hayden Christensen's head inserted over Sebastian Shaw\\" changes look like genuine improvements. <br /> <br />Walter Hill just managed to do what medicine previously thought unimaginable - he raped himself. He took a film loved by no less than four generations and murdered it, spat on it and desecrated its corpse. <br /> <br />The \\"ultimate cut\\" was turned into an imbecilic quasi-comic book film. Hill destroyed numerous legendary scenes by inserting awkward zooms, awkward cuts at pivotal moments, and - oh, heaven have mercy - freezes and transitions into \\"stylized\\" pseudo-comic book panels (actually seemingly made with the emboss filter of Photoshop), often complete with inane \\"thought bubble\\" comments. <br /> <br />Case in point - the scene in which the Warriors encounter the Furies. A powerful scene in which tension grows with every second, conveyed only through the actors' eyes and Barry de Vorzon's slowly creeping-up score. At least that is how it looked originally... because in the new version, at the second when the tension just began growing, the \\"new\\" film freezes and transforms into an idiotic comic book panel complete with - oh, God, why?!? - an imbecilic bubble comment stating \\"Holy sh..., the Baseball Furies!\\". That's how bad the new version is - and this isn't even the worst example. <br /> <br />He shattered the mystery of the ambient \\"Wonder Wheel\\" opening by inserting an absolutely unnecessary animate reference to Anabasis before it. And, worst of all, he obliterated the wonderful ending scene. You know it - it is the symbolic take showing the survivors  as they walk away from the memory of the night of horror towards the - perhaps hopeful - fresh dawn. I called this scene \\"the walk to nowhere - somewhere - everywhere\\". <br /> <br />In the new version, the walk is frozen after a few seconds and spliced into four idiotic comic book panels which then remain on screen. That single change is so wretchedly disgraceful that it defies belief. It is akin to taking, say, the closing scene of \\"The Godfather\\" and cutting it at the moment when Michael Corleone sits and thinks, rolling end credits at that moment rather than following it to show the legendary \\"new don\\" conclusion. <br /> <br />As the final insult, the DVD does not offer any worthy extras. There are some standard featurettes, but not much beyond that. Hill \\"does not believe in commentaries\\", apparently, so this is absent, but doesn't he believe in viewers' rights to watch deleted scenes, either? <br /> <br />It's true that most deleted scenes, in any films, on any DVD, are usually worthless and epitomize drivel - yet even truly bad ones are often included, since any viewer devoted to any film is always interested in seeing extra footage from it. I understand that Walter Hill may feel ashamed of those scenes and does not want them to be viewed even as a curiosity. I would not be surprised if some of them had not even been shot by him (particularly the infamous, awful day opening) - that would make his objection against their inclusion perfectly justified. However, considering that deleted scenes that do make it to existing DVDs as extra features very rarely represent all material that was cut from the film, and taking into account the typical running time of most rough cuts and workprints from late 70s, I would suspect that there was well over half an hour of alternate or additional footage shot - and that would be enough to choose some interesting snippets for the disc. And, Mister Hill... however bad even the worst deleted scene was, it would be practically impossible for it to be worse than the comic book insertions in the Ultimately Disgraceful Cut. <br /> <br />If there is anything worth having in this disc, it's thenew cover. It restores the original 1979 poster - the famous gang conclave in the park, with the tagline \\"They are the armies of the night\\". (The UK version has this cover, anyway. The US release apparently features an idiotic, oversaturated \\"Photochop\\" of a random scene from the film instead - identical to the previously available DVD's cover, but tinted in \\"angry\\" MTV red now...) <br /> <br />If that travesty is indeed representative of the concept that Walter Hill originally had in his mind in 1979, then I praise the studio board that changed it into the version that the audience knows and loves.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|haven't I heard this stuff before....it all sounds the same. Very safe, VERY BORING and just awful. Doesn't anyone want to be honest hear and say it is elevator music. I HAVE NEVER BEEN IMPRESSED with how highly touted this guitarist is in the music world. He really isn't good at all and most of your more outstanding guitartists and musical \\"geeks\\" in general know this. I understand his appeal to a certain generation but hec Frank Marino is far superior, Jeff Beck is far superior, Joe Satriani is the God of Thunder and a long line of others, Petrucci, Vai, Allan Holdsworth, Gary Moore etc.(this list could go on and on), all light years ahead of Clapton............. Clapton has really created a false mystique that he never backs up with musicianship. Thankfully there are some honest reviewers here who don't mince words. I won't either. Eric Clapton is the most overated musician that I have ever witnessed and I would hope that the truth rear it's ugly head a bit more when it comes to this artist. The fact that he has won awards for his guitar prowess/song abilities etc. is on par with the the present day blowhards like Green Day. They scoff at America, but wear eyeliner and silver suits for the MTV corporate suits. Nice way to kiss some A$* Green Day, makes you wonder if there is a blue print for these non-artists to make a career at frauding the American public. Why are other countries a bit more discerning when it comes to music and not jumping in on all the faceless bandwagons? Go ahead and ask Mr. Clapton the biggest snake oil seller of them all.

Mellencamp's belief that the Indonesian drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist was unjust adds weight to this CD.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Yes, it has been mentioned quite frequently in the press that Serenity is a follow-up to the cancelled Firefly series, but I think more emphasis needs to be put on the fact that this is a stand alone movie, and quite a good one at that. A lot of the people I've talked to that have seen it had never heard of Firefly before a week ago, and they all agree that it is a fantastic movie. To me, it had all of the right ingredients that made me a fan of the series in the first place: action, humor, and most importantly, character development (something that movies nowadays seem to lack in abundance). The script is top notch, peppered with Joss Whedon's quirky trademark dialogue, and the acting is A+. Don't let the fact that there are no \\"BIG NAME\\" stars in this movie sway you - Serenity is a treat from start to finish, and has the potential to be the next Star Wars if given a chance.

6305696071|3.0|The studio took a lot of time with anniversary extras for this self-described modern day 'Cinderella' film. I'm impressed with the number and quality of extras which are included inside this one release.  Even with all of the technology we now have, very few movies get such extensive anniversary releases.<br /><br />I get a kick out of watching a young Julia Roberts and Richard Gere (were we all that young once?) parade around in late 80's fashions, but I've got to add my voice to the people who are questioning why Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) had to be a prostitute?<br /><br />Even ruthless corporate raiders are going to have second thoughts about sleeping with prostitutes in the AIDS era--much less falling head over heels with one. Gere and Roberts truly are amazing actors for their subsequently having a career beyond this screen play. The large plot holes would have easily sunk less talented individuals.<br /><br />If Gary Marshall did not want to have her actually look and act like a prostitute, then Vivian Ward needed to have been made into anything else. Surely there were other low-income and barely making it jobs in 1980s/1990's Los Angeles which could have provided the inspiration for consistent character development.<br /><br />The production extras which tell what filming this movie was like were really funny. However, Marshall obviously did not know how to direct this film as it had been written. The film would have worked even better if Roberts's character had been anything else other than a prostitute.

B0000524CY|5.0|PLOT:  The film begins at an archaeological dig in Iraq. One of the men working there is a 70-something year old priest named Father Lancaster Merrin (Max von Sydow.) Merrin has had a long and dark history. Something scares him more than anything. Merrin is getting ready to go back to America, but before leaving, he finds a statue at the excavation; a statue of a demon named Pazuzu. Merrin stares straight into the eyes of the statue and he feels a pain in the pit of his stomache, for he knows that one day he will have to face the devil again. The film then jumps to the other side of the world, in Georgetown (Washington D.C.) A famous actress named Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) lives there with her pre-teen daughter Regan (Linda Blair). Regan is a very loveable child, but suddenly she starts to show strange behavior. She starts swearing, urinating in front of people, acting violent. Doctors say that she has a rare nervous disorder, but ridolin doesn't help and her condition starts to get worse; much worse. When Chris has no one else to turn to, she goes to see Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller). She asks him if he would perform an exorcism on Regan, but he quickly turns her down because he needs approval from the Catholic Church; not to mention he has his own inner demons to deal with. He finally agrees to review Regan's condition. With the evidence he can collect, he may be able to get approval from the Church. Karras, a psychiatrist as well as a priest, feels that there is probably a mental explanation for Regan's condition. He soon realizes that he is up against the devil himself.<br /><br />COMMENTS:  In my honest opinion, this is the scariest film of all time. I had the pleasure of seeing this film in the theater when it was re-released in 2000, and it scared the hell out of me. William Friedkin's directorial style was brilliant. The film also boasts a fine cast with great acting. William Peter Blatty wrote the screenplay based on his own 1971 novel, and it's fantastic. Not only is this a great horror film, it's a great character study. We see that both Merrin and Karras are men of God, but they are flawed characters. Merrin has had a run-in with the devil before and he's scared to death of him. He knows that he has an on-going fight with him. Karras has his own insecurities as well; he begins to doubt his faith and constantly blaims himself for the death of his mother. Blatty's novel was actually inspired by a true story. A 13-year-old boy from Mt. Rainier, Maryland named Robbie was possessed by a demon in 1949. Robbie was able to make his bed shake without touching it, as well as move several other objects without physical contact. The boy also said blasphemous things in a diabolical voice. The local cardinal authorized an exorcism. The exorcism process lasted for 2 months. The demon within finally recognized the presence of St. Michael and was expelled from Robbie's body forever. Robbie remembered nothing of the possession afterwards, except the vision of St. Michael. The film was eventually followed by 2 inferior sequels: \\"Exorcist II: The Heretic\\" (1977) and \\"The Exorcist III\\" (1990); the latter was based on William Peter Blatty's sequel novel \\"Legion\\" (1983). 2 prequels also followed: \\"Exorcist: The Beginning\\" (2004) and it's alternate version \\"Dominion: Prequel To The Exorcist\\" (2005); the latter was released straight to DVD. This new DVD presents the film in its original widescreen theatrical ratio. This updated version has extra scenes not seen in the original 1973 release. It also features commentary by William Friedkin, bios and facts, and the theatrical trailer. I would recommend this film to anybody. It is a timeless classic.c. Not only is this a great horror film, it's a great character study. We see that both Merrin and Karras are men of God, but they are flawed characters. Merrin has had a run-in with the devil before and he's scared to death of him. He knows that he has an on-going fight with him. Karras has his own insecurities as well; he begins to doubt his faith and constantly blaims himself for the death of his mother. Blatty's novel was actually inspired by a true story. A 13-year-old boy from Mt. Rainier, Maryland named Robbie was possessed by a demon in 1949. Robbie was able to make his bed shake without touching it, as well as move several other objects without physical contact. The boy also said blasphemous things in a diabolical voice.

B0006L5RT2|5.0|I also was introduced to James Blunt by the NY radio station WPLJ. I noticed callers often requesting \\"You're Beautiful\\" to played. I went online to find out more about this man with an angel's voice and found his official page and watched some videos that I could only find on UK Launch. Well I was hooked and luckily my fiance was on his way over from the England and purchased Blunt's chart topping UK release 'Back to Bedlam' for me before coming over. We both listened to it for the first time and found it to be an excellent album. There is not one track that I find the least bit displeasing. In fact all Blunt's songs enchant the soul and enlighten your spirit.  <br /> <br />I look forward to seeing James Blunt in NYC this November. I'm hoping his live performace is as mesmerizing as his CD. I'll keep you posted.  <br /> <br />Peace,  <br />J
B0002J4X1Q|2.0|Let me start off by saying if you like true horror/zombie movies, then don't even bother watching this movie, it's a horror movie made for the mainstream, meaning it sucks. <br />Sure the lead character is hot, sure there are some nice looking zombies in the movie...but thats where all the good stuff ends. <br />The video game for the PS1 (and it's gamecube remake) are amazing, both in atmosphere and story telling, why the movie didn't follow them more closely is beyond me. Instead you get some horrible story about a computer and the t-virus (which is the only thing in the entire movie from the games, that and the spider-man creature). <br />Paul W.S. Anderson should not be allowed to make movies ever again, he is a stain on hollywood that needs to be cleaned away.

B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA dropped a jewell with Liquid Swords....The opening skit sets the tone for a very dark and introspective album....GZA lives up to his nickname \\"the genius\\" and provides some of the best crafted verses I've ever heard...Many of his verses are layered w/ double meanings that can actually take numerous listens until actually realizing fully what it all meant... <br /> <br />props to the RZA for providing some of the darkest and coldest beats I've ever heard... <br /> <br />Not saying this is the perfect hip hop album, its not even near my top 10 of all time....BUt to me , it is a certified hip hop classic and an overall flawless album...
B00005JMX6|2.0|I watched this film because I know one of the actors who played a minor character. He did fine in his little part, but what a terrible movie! Believe me, this is not anywhere near as good or funny as Risky Business or American Pie, two fine and original teenage sexual comedies. None of the major characters is interesting, likable, or funny, and neither are any of the prudish grownups. It's more like a twisted teenage version of Pretty Woman, in which a serious and proper high school valedictorian \\"saves\\" a gorgeous teenage porn star - and manages to get filthy rich in the process! I can forgive a lot if it were at least funny. I hope my friend gets to act in better movies.
B0002KVULG|3.0|I love Vampires. I do, I love them. In particular, I love the story of Dracula as told (and so often re-told in Hollywood) by Bram Stoker. I'd never heard of this film version of the story before, and so I ordered it, surprised to see such a cast roster in a movie that, from my standpoint, has been lost to time and glossier adaptations. Having watched it, I'm happy to say that this isn't a DVD I'll be giving away. It's not perfect (by a long shot), but it is quite good. <br /> <br />You know the story, mysterious European Count Dracula (Langella) comes to England and the undead body count starts to rise. Enter Van Helsing (Olivier) and Johnathan Harker, hell-bent on avenging their dead and saving their nearly-undead. <br /> <br />Direction here is stylish and slick, a monochromatic kind of gothicness with the odd splash of colour to keep our visual interest. It's a ploy that works well, and director John Badham wisely keeps away, for the most part, from poor special effects, allowing instead the romantic and hypnotic elements of the Dracula figure to create the tension. Langella's excellent as the vampire equivalent of Rudolf Valentino, he emanates a magnetism and charisma that, in less-capable hands, would simply have looked camp. Similarly, Kate Nelligan's portrayal of Lucy is excellent, she imbues the heroine with a lot more life and spirit than Winona Ryder or Frances Dade, and comes across as an independent and all the more sympathetic heroine, as opposed to some helpless 19th century woman who couldn't help herself. <br /> <br />In fact, all of the supporting cast, save an awkward turn by Jan Francis as Mina Van Helsing, is accomplished and good.  <br /> <br />The only real problems come with the script and storyline. Parts of Stoker's original novel have been cannibalised, rewritten or left out altogether, and the ending, while not particularly bad, is not rewarding enough for a movie of this scope. Some of the dialogue feels particularly clunky and trite, and while the solid, talented cast does their best with it, it can't help but affect the storyline in negative ways. <br /> <br />Still, for the beautiful direction and really rather excellent performances from the leads, this 1979 retelling of Dracula is highly recommended for fans of the story, and is still a very entertaining movie for the public at large.
B000AYQNYI|4.0|I have to say first off I am not really a Bon Jovi fan ,but my wife is a  fan so I do hear her playing their music in our home. <br />That being said, I like to think I am a savvy audio fan. I started out with a small 5.1 system 3 years ago and have continually upgraded by reading different articles and attending trade shows and also by shopping at high end audio visual stores. I love the system we now have even though it cost me an arm and a leg. My wife bought a dual disc version of Slippery so she could listen to it in surround and I have to say strickley from an 5.1 listening experence it is the most exciting cd/dvd I have listened to. Up until now I thought Dark Side of the Moon was the bench mark for contemporary music in 5.1 but this dual disc has now moved into first place for me. There is so much depth and clarity to the mixes, I can't believe I haven't known about their 5.1 catalogue before. If your an audiophile give this a listen, you'll love it. Oh yeah.. Living on a Prayer really does rock. Hope this helps..
0790744295|3.0|\\"Creepshow\\" is not a movie that will ever win any awards. It's a campy, comical collection of schlock-horror and B-movie inspired tales of zombies and alien retribution, and, although directed by the talented Geroge Romero and written by the talented Stephen King, somehow falls short of its intended mark, instead languishing in camp excessiveness. <br /> <br />There are five mimi-movies that comprise 'Creepshow', and the three of them show huge promise - they could be extended into full screenplays and remain successful, as tales. \\"Father's Day\\" starring Viveca Lindfors, \\"Something to tide you over\\" with Leslie Nielsen and a very young Ted Danson, and \\"They're creeping up on you\\" with E.G, Marshall are all very fine ideas, but, as with the two slightly weaker offerings - \\"The lonesome death of Jordy Verrill\\" and \\"The Crate\\", lose whatever horror they might have contained to some rotten dialogue and lousy special effects.  <br /> <br />These problems, however, far from removing all of the movie's worth, create a worthiness of their own, in that \\"Creepshow\\" is the \\"Mommie Dearest\\" of the horror genre. It's OTT and colourful, with no thought given to consistency or dialogue, so instead of a chilling and scary collection of short films, what we're left with is a funny, crazy ride on the lighter side of horror. \\"I... want... my... Caaaake, Bedelia!\\" is surely the \\"No Wire Hangers, Ever!\\" of Creepshow, and in \\"The lonesome death of Jordy Verrill\\", Stephen King as the titular Jordy seems to understand that this couldn't possibly be played for anything other than weird laughs. <br /> <br />Overall, for campy fun, I'd give the movie 4 stars. The DVD conversion, sadly, is awful - dirty and scratchy with pretty pathetic mono sound - so it loses another star for this.
B000AOJ9X0|2.0|First of all,I don't know you people pull your facts from.Probably the same place Buddy pulled the material for this album from. <br />#1 Jimi Hendrix did not\\"follow around Buddy Guy with a Tape Recorder\\".Were you there?? <br />#2 Buddy Guy is probably THE BEST LIVE guitarist still breathing.This I know because I've seen him more times than any of you! <br />#3 In making my last statement Buddy has not been a good studio player in the last 2 decades.Just because he's a \\"LEGEND\\" and I say that because (I know all you \\"know it alls\\"know thats the name of his bar,which by the way I've also been too,)that doesn't mean everything he puts out is Gods gift to the world!! <br /> My advice for the people reading this is being your not real fans of Buddy Guy anyway,Because if you were you wouldn't read this review before you got the album,Is go see him live,buy all his live albums Get every album before 1985 and stop making up facts about the Best LIVING BLUES GUITARIST!! <br />Have a nice day!
B00005JO0J|2.0|i saw this recently here in l.a. and thought it was fine--i never watched the show--just fine, not great.  it looked a little bit like a made for tv movie to me in terms of special effects and such, and whatever, that's fine too.  there's a place in my heart for low-to no budget sci-fi.  i thought that the death of one of the characters was done particularly for an 'ouch' effect, they're easily the most likable of the bunch and i think it's a real cop-out when writers/directors do this kind of thing.<br /><br />but can someone please explain the almost missionary zeal that the 'followers' of this film have?  no, i didn't watch the series, no, i don't WANT to watch the series based on what i saw in the film; and please stop telling me to see the movie again and to tell friends to see it. this behavior put me off so much that it made me like the movie far less than i might have if these rabid culty people weren't hanging outside the theater and in the lobby spouting off about it to the degree that they were.  it's a MOVIE, not a religion, people.  yeesh.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Alright, you are all idiots saying that \\"OMG A7X SOLD OUT! WHAT PUSSIES!\\" Please get over yourselves. I guess you all are music experts now. As some people have posted and it has been said, M. Shadows bursted a blood vessel in his throat becuase from screaming. This album was recorded during his recovery, and he was UNABLE to scream. The album is VERY different then Waking the Fallen, I will agree. In my opinion the band is still very good, but there was a drastic change, it's obvious. <br /> <br />So stop dissing people who liked the album, if you don't like it that's fine. You are free to state your opinion, but most of you are babbling. You all sound like EVERY little weird kid I went to high school with. Those kids who wear the spike bracelets and listen to music like Atreyu and then cry about how every band sold out. Please be a little bit more mature and intelligent with your reviews.
B000002GJH|5.0|A musical collaboration by Chris Cornell, Jeff Ament, Stone Gossard, Eddie Vedder, Matt Cameron and Mike McCready. <br /> <br />(former) Members of: <br />- Soundgarden (Cornell, Cameron) <br />- Green River & Mother Love Bone (Gossard, Ament) <br />- Pearl Jam (Vedder, McCready, Gossard, Ament, Cameron) <br />- Mad Season (McCready) <br /> <br />A guaranteed hit, one could say.  <br /> <br />After the untimely death of MotherLoveBone frontman Andrew Wood, singer/songwriter Chris Cornell penned a few songs in tribute to his friend and fellow Seattle musician, which were \\"Reach Down\\" and \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven.\\" He decided to approach Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament, Andy's friends and bandmates with the new material and then the project really started to take off. <br />  <br />At the time, Soundgarden had yet to become superstars and Cornell recruited his Soundgarden compatriot Matt Cameron for this project who coincidentally at that time was working with Gossard, Ament and a new guy on the block, one Mike McCready. To finish the line-up they auditioned a potential frontman, San Diego surfer boy: Eddie Vedder. Rick Parasher was reeled in to do production duties and off they went. <br /> <br />The first track on the cd is the Cornell penned \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\". An amazing piece of musical balance. Good music, great lyrics and even better vocals. A fine choice for an opening track. <br /> <br />Next is \\"Reach Down\\", which shows the group's potential of playing heavier music than just (semi-)acoustic ballads. In the middle of the song is an extensive instrumental placed, which lasts for over 3,5 minutes. <br /> <br />\\"Hunger Strike\\", the bands first single, might very well be the cd's best song. For anyone who would like to hear what a combination of PJ & Soundgarden sounds like, check it out! Vedder and Cornell share vocal duties and both sound excellent. Especially when later in the song when they follow each other up. <br /> <br />\\"Pushin Forward Back\\", the cd's 4th song is yet again a musical masterpiece, even though I personally dont really like Cornell's lyrics to this song. The music is great and it justs has this energetic vibe to it. <br /> <br />\\"Call me a Dog\\" slows you down again, giving you a moment to recover from the previous songs' activity. McCready's guitar solo near the end of the song is well crafted and suits the song very well. And that's a feat that a lot of musicians seem to forget these days... a solo has to has a function.  <br /> <br />\\"Times of Trouble\\" continues the mellow state of things started by the previous song. A pretty good song, especially the chorus. The piano could have been left out of you ask me, but I assume the producer-played instrument has some sort of function. <br /> <br />\\"Wooden Jesus\\" starts of with 30 seconds of fine drumming & percussion, but the rest of the song is a bit too plain for my taste. The guitar solo, the music and the singing just dont sound as good as the rest of the album. Lyrics make up for some of the lesser aspects of the song, but I still think this is the weakest song by Temple of the Dog. <br /> <br />\\"Your Savior\\" picks up where 'pushing forward back' ended in terms of energetical vibe. It is still pretty easy going at times, but the electric guitar takes on more of a central role in this song. Decent song. <br /> <br />\\"Four Walled World\\" is an awesome song. When first listening to the cd I was afraid that after the first 5 songs they had used up most of their chemistry, but listening to FWW simply is a pleasure.  <br /> <br />Last, but not least, \\"All Night Thing\\" is the perfect closer for this album. Makes you think about all you've heard again. <br /> <br />All in all a very good album, just missing the 'masterpiece' classification in my opinion, due to 2 or 3 lesser songs. <br /> <br />A sidenote to all this, is that even though Eddie Vedder is credited for singing backup vocals on 3 songs on this album but, aside from his co-lead vocals on \\"Hunger Strike\\", isnt really noticable throughout the songs. <br /> <br />\\"I want to show you something, like joy inside my heart  <br />Seems I been living in the Temple Of The Dog  <br />Where would I live if I were a man of golden words  <br />Or would I live at all\\" - Andy Wood, \\"Man of Golden Words\\"
B000002G0P|5.0|Never really caring for their first two albums, I'm not sure why I picked this CD up years ago.  But I immediately recognized that this was something different.  It's a brilliant album, a masterpiece in my opinion.  I of course later got the first two albums, which never got much play time in my CD player.  The fourth is a great album also, and I encourage all to check it out.  However, III Sides is such an underated album.  The musicianship has always been there with Extreme, but here the song-writing becomes ethereal.  It's like a Zeppelin/Styx/Yes/Rush/Queen-metal-baby.  Get it... you'll see what I'm saying!!!
1401206905|5.0|In 1986, Frank Miller sent a ripple through the comic book industry with the release of \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.\\"  In this, his follow-up, Miller opted to go from telling of Batman's 'ending' to his beginning.  With artist David Mazzuchelli on board and the use of a very specific color palette, the results are mesmerizing.  In a very concise story that features nearly no \\"Rogues Gallery\\" villains, we see young Bruce Wayne battling a corrput police force, as well as waging war on organized crime as he figures out who he is underneath it all and becomes The Batman.  Mazzuchelli's Bruce Wayne is identical to a young Gregory Peck - one wonders how Peck might have portrayed him, given the opportunity.   <br /> <br />The beauty of Miller's work, both here and elsewhere, is that his writing style gives the world his characters inhabit a realistic edge.  This is true here.  All of the characters are deeply flawed, and at times many of them become less than savory for a brief period.  But they all feel human, and fit into the fabric of what we see and read here. Bruce Wayne is indeed the central character, and his path is rife with trial and error as he reaches that point of becoming Batman, and even after.  Jim Gordon was previously never as fleshed out in the comics as he is here.  Perhaps the next Batman movie will give him more story, because he's a great character.  He's used well by Miller throughout this work. <br /> <br />If the above plot description brings to mind the second and third act of Batman Begins, that's because the filmmakers admit to having been influenced heavily by this work.  Even the most casual Batman fan will enjoy this story, especially in this excellent edition.
B000002KZ6|4.0|This is definitely the Talking Heads' best album without Brian Eno.  It's by far their most accessible, but also quite inventive.  Losing Eno, this group could easily have retrogressed into the mode of producing cheap, unimaginative imitations of the sound he previously created for them -- enjoying Top-40 success but committing musical suicide.  This, incidentally, is precisely what DEVO did after Brain parted company with them (and to a slightly lesser extent, David Bowie in the mid-80s).  The Heads, on the other hand, had in David Byrne a near-equal to Eno (some would say protege and not be far off the mark) in studio experimentation and vision.  Byrne collaborated with Eno a few years before on the excellent \\"My Life in the Bush of Ghosts\\" and with this album began to show that the relationship was time well spent.
B000001C6D|5.0|Although their past few albums have been too lightweight for my tastes, the first 5 albums by the band are classic GOTHIC METAL, NOT doom metal like one reviewer put it. Doom is Candlemass, early Sabbath, Solitude Aeturnus, Wretched, Pentagram, Obsessed, etc. Gothic metal is Paradise Lost up until the late 90s, mid period My Dying Bride etc. Paradise Lost is just a great gothic metal band who has become over the last few albums.... LOST, but this album from the mid 90s is classic.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day is horrible shopping mall punk. You are not punk if you shop at hot topix. If you are looking for something real, buy an old Johnny Thunders cd.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Only few bands can make two awesome records in such a short time just like Fran Ferdinand did. Maybe The Strokes, but that's it. Franz Ferdinand wrapped up an excellent second album, blending their usual pop-rock tracks with some surprisingly catchy ballads. <br />\\"The Fallen\\" introduces the main mood of the record with a clever use of the two guitars, running on and cooperating with the vocals, always pleasant, just like happens in the second track \\"Do You Want To\\", the first single came out and probably the most involving song of this LP.  <br />Slightly nervous, \\"This Boy\\" is an example of high-energy rock without losing agreeability. Then comes track 4 \\"Walk Away\\", the first amazing ballad, dealing with  acoustic guitars and polished vocals.  <br />The following song (\\"Evil and a Heathen\\")it's a tribute to vintage rock made with energy and style. There comes \\"You're The Reason I'm Leaving\\", a catchy chorus with a background of poignant music.  <br />Track 7 is \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\", a tribute to The Beatles so well made that one could easily think that it's a cover or something like that... but it's not. This ballad represents clearly an artistic growth from the band.  <br />The following song it's \\"Well That Was Easy\\", dealing with surprising changes of rhythm and an ironic text. Here comes \\"What You Meant\\", despite of the title not very meaningful but still pleasant, especially one of the last guitar riffs.  <br />Seems to hear some Keith Richards riffs with a ubiquitous bass and an hard-working voice on \\"I'm Your Villain\\", probably the most complete song of the record, a new \\"manifesto\\" of Franz Ferdinand music.  <br />The following track \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" deals with aggressive vocals, fast rhythm and it's perfect because after it comes the third and final ballad, \\"Fade Together\\", which brings a totally different mood, with a polite piano on a base of soft and gentle instruments flourishing behind some excellent vocals... nothing more vintage than this! <br />The ending track (\\"Outsiders\\") brings again some of the precedent energy, with catchy guitars and some far-west harmonics closing the album in a most awesome way. <br /> <br />This it Their music. Do not be satisfied with modern rock, because You Could Have It So Much Better...with Franz Ferdinand!
B0002IU988|4.0|This album reminds me of a great Creed album. The album sounds like a creed album, the only thing is that scott stapp is replaced by another singer. That's kind of sad because stapp was a stronger vocalist. That's way I gave the album 4 stars.
B000AL730O|5.0|McCartney is well known as not only one of the world's finest songwriters for his work with the Beatles, but also, sadly, as one of the most twee, self-indulgent and horribly cheesy solo artists for almost all of his work that followed. The occasional good song on a solo album tended to be overshadowed by the chirpy, thumbs-aloft, mullet-wearing purveyor of the naffest songs imaginable.<br /><br />So it was with delight that I listened to this album. There isn't a bad song on it, although many are pretty average. One or two of them are good enough to justify buying the album alone. What really makes this album stand out is the outstanding production: McCartney has found someone who knows how to bring out the best in him.<br /><br />You can almost hear the battle on record: McCartney occasionally straying too close to the candle, trying to add in a couple of cheesy \\"whoo-hoos\\" or a corny lyric, while the producer swifly veers him away from the cheese and keeps the songs tight, meaningful and without too much self-indulgence. The songs shine as a result. There are unapologetically Beatle-y moments that sound natural, not some bad attempt to recapture past glories. McCartney's over-cosy voice is tempered by some sparse, minor-key and sometimes darn spooky instrumentation that echoes his experimental best work of 40 years before.<br /><br />If I were Sir Paul, I'd choose the one good song on each of my prior solo albums, re-record them with this guy to make one classic double album, and then burn all my older solo work.<br /><br />Here is finally a McCartney solo album with only 2 or 3 seconds of cringing-at-cheese to deal with, and the rest of the time a firm hand seems to have veered him back towards adding to, not insulting, his legacy.
B0007GAERG|4.0|To say that Mariah was a has-been after her critically slammed \\"Charmbracelet,\\" is untrue. Granted, Mariah slipped into oblivion after her ill-fated GLITTER movie and soundtrack, she returned to the spotlight with \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi.\\"  <br /> <br />The album has fewer songs with rappers than  its predecessors. It only features four, of whom three sing (not rap) most of their parts. Many of the songs had rap sections cut, for example, N.O.R.E was supposed to be on \\"Your Girl\\", and Ludacris on \\"Stay the Night\\".  <br /> <br />Mariah Carey is known for her bridges and breaks, songs like \\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Stay the Night\\", \\"Shake It Off\\", and \\"Your Girl\\" lack a bridge.  <br /> <br />Carey uses non-synthesized instruments more than before; although she had previously experimented with them on songs such as \\"Subtle Invitation\\" and the single version of \\"Bringin' on the Heartbreak\\" (both from \\"Charmbracelet\\"), this is the first time they are so prominent on a studio album. <br /> <br />With that said, I would shy away from purchasing this release and instead purchase the re-release DualDisc, slated to include  remixes of two of the album's songs: a remix of \\"We Belong Together\\" featuring Jadakiss, Styles P, and DJ Clue, and a \\"Shake It Off\\" remix featuring Jay-Z and Young Jeezy. Although these remixes were released on iTunes, they have never been available on a non-promotional commercial release. <br /> <br />The re-release will also include entirely new songs. The first is \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" produced by Jermaine Dupri , which is the fourth single from the album in the U.S. Also to be included is \\"So Lonely\\" produced by Rodney Jerkins aka \\"Darkchild\\", a duet with Twista. There is a third new live duet with John Legend of \\"With You I'm Born Again\\" recorded at the VH1 Save The Music 2005 charity concert. <br /> <br />The album will also include music videos for the album's already released singles: \\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Shake It Off\\", and \\"Get Your Number\\" (released outside the US). There is also a possibility that the music video for \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" will be included. Since the album is a DualDisc, the entire audio content of the album will also be released in DVD quality PCM audio. <br /> <br />Now for my raitings: <br /> <br />5 Stars <br />WE BELONG TOGETHER  <br />STAY THE NIGHT <br />ONE AND ONLY <br />DON'T FORGET ABOUT US <br />CIRCLES <br />JOY RIDE  <br /> <br />I selected these tracks, because they are the ones I usually listen to when I am playing the disc. They are funky, catchy and really get you going. Let it be known that \\"Joy Ride\\" was produced and written with Mariah Carey by 15 year old Young Genious. Notice that the song's vocals are low. This is due to the fact that an error occured with the masters of the track, leaving only pre-recorded background vocals and main vocals. <br /> <br />4 Stars <br />IT'S LIKE THAT <br />MINE AGAIN <br />SHAKE IT OFF <br />SAY SOMETHING <br />GET YOUR NUMBER <br />SO LONELY <br /> <br />These tracks are songs I listen to whenever I am in the mood. They are nice to hear, but can get a little annoying with the repeated choruses and hooks, especially \\"It's Like That.\\" <br /> <br />3 Stars <br />YOUR GIRL <br />I WISH YOU KNEW <br />TO THE FLOOR <br />WITH YOU I'M BORN AGAIN <br />FLY LIKE A BIRD <br /> <br />These songs I consider filler. They are added to complete an album's fullfillment. Out of all the 27 tracks recorded for \\"Mimi,\\" why she chose these, is really unknown. <br /> <br />In closing, Mariah has done well. Hopefully she will continue to deliver quality music. <br /> <br />NOTE: The re-release of \\"Mimi/DualDisc\\" will be available on November 15. Coincidentally, Madonna's \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor,\\" the most eagerly anticipated CD of 2005 (according to Time Magazine,) will be released on the same day. It is doubtful that \\"Mimi/DualDisc\\" will chart high, considering its a re-release.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|It's hard to be objective about new material when you're a Neil Young fan.  However, I am not in love with all of his work.  Prairie Wind is a great effort and the finished material is very well done.  Someone described \\"Greendale\\" as a \\"demo tape\\" that became a CD.  Greendale is an excellent piece of work as well and I cannot argue the \\"rough around the edges\\" sound but you have to consider how Neil \\"hears\\" his work re-produced.  Crazy Horse (Greendale) vs. basically The International Harvesters (Prairie Wind) are a long way apart in concept and sound.  These songs are heartfelt and very personal in nature, revealing things about Neil's life that have rarely gone beyond the private circle of his family and friends.  When he has said \\"I heard Emmy Lou's voice or, Ben Keith's steel guitar when I wrote these songs\\", we are listening to what must be his replication of that sound on the finished product.  Many of Neil's albums must be heard several times and more frequently than not, they will grow on you.  Prairie Wind is one of these.  I am amazed at Neil's marketing skills to reach out to the listener with a DVD of the work being filmed live during the recording sessions.  The interaction between Neil, his friend's and the musicians are a visual testimony to just how important the music really is to him.  I am certain that the Nashville concert film with these performances, when it is released, will be outstanding as well.  So, I rate Prairie Wind as one of the best pieces of Neil's work that I have.  And, I basically have all of his releases.
0765309408|5.0|Wow. I'm speechless. Starship Troopers is one of my favorite books of all times. Must have read it at least 15-20 times. This book however is even better. Scalzi has incredible vision and is a great writer too. This book is not a deep philosophical exercise - but pure joy and entertainment. I hope that the upcoming sequel can keep up the pace. Buy it now!
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I firmly believe that Tim Burton did a good job with the story, he never fails to bring color and imagination to his films.  Although 1971's \\"Willy Wonka\\" was a good movie, I don't feel that Wilder's portrail was as closely matched to the book's Wonka. Wonka was some what of a recluse with a less than delightful childhood, so it would make sense that he would be a somewhat akward character, laking in strong social skills. I feel that Burton was the perfect person to bring Dahl's classic book to film, with his ability to bring imagination into reality.  <br />I must admit, choosing Depp for the part of Wonka was a little difficult for me to imagine at first, but he gave an excelent performance. I loved seeing Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore(Charlie) work together again; they were wonderful in \\"Finding Deverland\\". Freddie is a wonderful little actor, I would like to see his carreer carry on into adulthood. <br /> Tim Burton, along with the acting skills of Johnny Depp, succeeded in creating a wonderful and unique film that I feel relates more to the original Dahl story. Dahl himself would've enjoyed it, since he himself disapproved of the 1971 film. I wish people could stop comparing \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" to the 71' film, so that they can see it for the interesting, delightful, inspiring film that it is.
B000002MTR|4.0|This was their last Funk album before Californication and By the Way took a more alternative route.  On this album you take away My Friends you have a funk album.  Dave navarro came in and did an incredible job with his six string and Flea's bass licks are actually the must underated out of all the albums.   <br /> <br />Highlights of this album are Warped, Aeroplane, Coffee Shop, Walk About, and My Friends.   <br /> <br />This is a definate album to check out.  This is definately their most underrated album.
B000002MP2|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best alternative rock album ever made.  Every single song is good.  I got the album on cassette back in '94 when I was in first grade, and I've been listening to it ever since, and I haven't gotten tired of it yet.  A must-have for anyone who likes alternative rock.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|This is one of the best dvds ive ever owned.  I watched, i learned and im very impressed.  Ive always wondered alot of thing about Dylan and now my questions are answered.  It paints the best picture possible about a man who changed music forever.  Dyan is a true genius.  Its hallarious when he aswering questions from dumb reporters.  \\"Do you listen to my music\\"  \\"No\\"  \\"So why you asking me questions\\"
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Let's get one thing straight from the start: this is not the same Cream as the band that broke up 37 years ago.  Yes, it's the same three guys, but those almost-four decades have made their mark.  The good news is that, overall, it's a pretty good mark.   <br /> <br />On the downside, Jack Bruce's voice has lost some of it's range and power, and Ginger Baker sounds like what he is: a senior citizen trying to remind people what he once could do.  At times he's successful in that attempt, and at others he falls short.  The competitive spark that fired Cream's sound has fizzled.  The sound of Bruce and Clapton seemingly battling for dominance of the band's lead is no more. <br /> <br />In its place, though, is the sound of three musicians playing together, and doing it extraordinarily well.  Clapton does some of his best playing in years here, and Jack Bruce's playing still puts him in the top ranks of bass players.  As you can see from the list of songs, they've hit every period of Cream's (brief) history.  The arrangements are tight and crisp, and the solos are superb.  In particular, the arrangements of \\"White Room\\" and \\"Badge\\"(the original recordings of which have never been recreated well on stage) are outstanding. <br /> <br />Other reviewers will doubtless provide lists of the best tracks on the album, and every list will differ.  I'll settle for saying that the scorching work on \\"Stormy Monday\\" is, by itself, well worth the cost of the album. <br /> <br />Unlike other bands from the Sixties that have become oldies acts or parodies of themselves, Cream came back full blast.  This album is a pure delight.  As much as I normally avoid music DVDs, the knowledge that the companion DVD to this collection contains different versions of these songs (it was, after all, a four night stand) has me hustling over to check it out.
B00005V0X5|5.0|However, I own the old school copy. I have never seen this delux package, it says its been completley remixed in the pro-reveiw. Now there was a time when I wouldn't have thought twice about this but recently I've read about a few bands that destroyed their original albums by re mixing them. OZZY for example apparently destroyed BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY (read the reveiws, every single one says that the album SUCKS now. Hard to believe.<br /><br />My point is that, I really like the raw, garage like sound of this album, in fact, I like this album more than any other MEGADETH album based solely on the recording quality of it. AND the songs are F'in awesome too, but, I'm a little concerned for new fans based on the whole \\"re-mixing\\" idea.<br /><br />I haven't seen any thing bad yet. Maybe it sounds incredible. I'm going to have to check it out for muyself I think. Bonus tracks too, I'm getting it. Expect this reveiw to change once I get further information, as for now I'm just putting up a concern. Make sure they haven't butchered this thing before you buy- otherwise it seems like a really cool package...<br /><br />THE OLD ALBUM IS F*%^IN INSANE!  ONE OF THE ALL TIME BEST
B0009SOFFY|5.0|Iggy Pop and his Stooges are one of the great underrated classics of rock n' roll history. We owe this band so much and yet give them such little attention even on VH1 Classic (though VH1 has at least put the band on its 100 Greatest Artists Of Hard Rock list), but those who truly love rock music and what it can do will eventually come across the snarling music contained in \\"The Stooges\\" and \\"Fun House,\\" not to mention the timeless third album \\"Raw Power.\\" Though \\"Raw Power\\" received a shining, brutally loud remix a couple of years ago, the first Stooges albums are barely getting the deserved special editions aficionados and rock enthusiasts have been waiting for. Now \\"Fun House\\" really comes alive with remastered sound that truly exposes the intensity and fire Iggy Pop let loose on the world. The story goes that in 1967 Iggy caught a Doors show and was so impressed by Jim Morrison that he decided to invent his own brand of shock rock theatrics, this of course resulted in being one of the most memorable acts hard rock has ever produced. The sound and attitude of the Stooges is everywhere, especially in bands like Marilyn Manson, Guns N' Roses, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, Green Day, R.E.M., The Vines, The Hives, The White Stripes etc. etc. etc. The Punk movement claimed Iggy as its godfather and artists like Blondie and The Sex Pistols payed homage to this, one of their great heroes. \\"Fun House\\" embodies all that made The Stooges great, it's a mix of raw sound with wild theatrics, images. Think of William S. Burroughs framed by Nine Inch Nails (Iggy is in fact a Burroughs fan recorded with the legendary beat writer before he died). The songs have catchy, heavy hooks and a seductive, animalistic air as in \\"Down On The Street,\\" a crawling jam that can be the soundtrack for a night of lust and fun. \\"T.V. Eye\\" is the wildness of Iggy and The Stooges caught on tape with it's primal screams and burning guitar licks. \\"Loose\\" is an interesting number that progresses from chaos to an almost poppy chorus. \\"L.A. Blues\\" is pure expressionism while \\"1970\\" has that anthemic feel of all great Punk (and this was BEFORE the genre even existed). \\"Fun House\\" is in a sense a packaging of all the craziness, sex and musical creativity evident in American music. It feels as if the Stooges took all of America's most notable genres like blues, jazz and rock n' roll and filtered it through their bold, excess-drenched concepts. Here is music that is up to the level of the legend. Iggy Pop of course garnered fame cutting himself with glass on stage and even having audience members perform oral sex on him during shows, but the music personifies completely the wild theatrics and even the more intellectual ideas behind the shock and provocation. Like all great rock \\"Fun House\\" stands up to the best music hard rock bands have offered us in the past few years. Listen to The Stooges and you realize Disturbed, Staind and Godsmack are pretty much just p---y music.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|It's a good time to release \\"Enemy of God,\\" because heavy metal is now quite popular; but, since it's so popular, Kreator also have some competition. Bands like Lamb of God and Shadows Fall have cropped up and have been given the label \\"modern thrash,\\" but, when you listen to \\"Enemy of God,\\" you'll realize there's nothing like the real thing (true thrash!)<br /><br />After going through an experimental phase, thrash metal titans Kreator have returned to form with their twelfth album. And while this is their thrashiest album in years, \\"Enemy of God\\" also incorporates some melodic death metal into the mix, because singer Miland Petrozza's vocals sort of sound like Devin Townsend's (of Strapping Young Lad). The vocals aren't great, because singer Miland sounds somewhat silly at times. Fortunately, however, there's enough whiplash guitar shredding to make up for it. The guitars are so fast and catchy, they echo prime `80's thrash, like Slayer.<br /><br />The album begins with a bang; track one, the title song, shoots out of the gate with blindingly fast riffs. And from there on, it almost never lets up. Even when things slow down, like for track six, they eventually speed up to at least a moderately fast chug. \\"Suicide Terrorist\\" sounds almost Priest-y, with fast, explosive riffs and three guitar solos, and \\"World Anarchy\\" has a rocketing beat, with almost careening guitar work. Other highlights include the creepy, dark lyrics (like \\"All I see is mothers dragging children to the grave\\") of \\"Impossible Brutality,\\" the great drum work and extended guitar solo on \\"Voices of the Dead,\\" track eight's catchy, chugging riffs, and on \\"Dying Race Apocalypse,\\" they take a cue from Sepultura by including an acoustic guitar intro (before the buzzsaw guitars and lightning fast double bass drums kick in).<br /><br />All in all, Kreator have created a true thrash masterpiece. And it is easily the best (and maybe the only) true thrash release of 2005. Have the leaders returned? No. The MASTERS have returned..
B00005JKG7|4.0|I originally saw \\"The Fog\\" in the theater, and remember being frightened in multiple places. John Carpenter managed to make a low budget picture scary using minimum special effects and a whole lot of fog. While fog has been used in other movies (I remember the attack of the werewolf in \\"Silver Bullet,\\" where the werewolf attacked from the fog around his pursuers' feet), it was pervasive and thick, and the attacks came suddenly from the dense fog and yet the fog cleared enough to let you see the action.<br /><br />Antonio Bay is a small seaside town with a past. The past includes allowing a group of sailors to die on their ship. We know that this is a horror movie, and the dead rarely rest easy in their graves, particularly watery graves. When an eerie dense fog rolls over a ship, and there are thumps and bumps and suddenly the ship is unmanned, we know there is something wrong with the fog.<br /><br />We can also guess the fog will not stay out to see. As the intensity in the movie builds we see the fog roll in and the fog roll out, accompanying a great cast. John Houseman is spooky beach narrator Mr. Machen, sending chills through his audience as easily as he did his classes in \\"The Paper Chase.\\" Janet Leigh is a town mover and shaker Kathy Williams and her indignation quickly changes to fear as she realizes the fog is outside her control and her experience. Jamie Lee Curtis is free spirit Elizabeth Solley, who seems to be a hands breadth from disaster for most of the movie. Hal Holbrook is Father Malone, a priest with psychological issues who feels like a martyr, intended or otherwise, from the time we first meet him. Tom Atkins plays Nick Castle, who fortunately takes into stride that evil ghosts are wandering around town with bad intent. Even John Carpenter makes an appearance.<br /><br />With all this talent, what more can you ask? How about Adrienne Barbeau as sultry Stevie Wayne, the voice of the local radio station who manages to put movie-goers into the right frame of mind as the fog rolls over the town and Stevie becomes an inadvertent Cassandra, heard only by those of us watching the movie. Ultimately I was clinging to the edge of my seat as Stevie Wayne tried to stay one step ahead of the fog and its evil.<br /><br />John Carpenter made \\"The Fog\\" in the style of horror movies of old. The movie relies on what you can barely see and the ever-present fog to build atmosphere rather than splattering blood and organs. The tension as the fog rolls into town and the bizarre events unroll builds until you think something has to happen, and John Carpenter keeps you guessing as to if and when throughout. Perhaps the best tension of all is when the fog rolls into Stevie Wayne's radio station and she frantically and fearfully tries her best to defend herself from the unknown.<br /><br />\\"The Fog\\" has its flaws, as do most movies of this type. However, I somehow manage to overlook them each time I watch because I get caught up in the characters and the story. There are few enough horror movies that are made in the style of \\"The Fog,\\" and when one is made that makes you want to watch the movie a second or third time, you know it is a winner.o the right frame of mind as the fog rolls over the town and Stevie becomes an inadvertent Cassandra, heard only by those of us watching the movie.

B00082IJ08|1.0|I've read all the great reviews of this album and I'm willing to admit it's just me, but I HATE it, really, truly. My 8 year old daughter and I listened to it at least 5-6 times to give it a chance (like when we first tried Coldplay, we didn't love it, but then it grew on us), but to the unitiated fan of classic rock, it sounds like a bunch of cheap synthesizers and really weird stuff. I didn't find it offensive, just bad. Maybe I've hit that point where I'm too old -- it sounds too techno, too much like \\"I wish we were Pink Floyd but we're not.\\" And I like Hip Hop, I like some current rock (I love the White Stripes), but I am incapable of hearing what is great about this CD although Lord knows I tried.
1594481784|4.0|Nick Hornby gives music and romance a philosophical spin in \\"High Fidelity,\\" the funny, rueful book about men, music, and modern love. While occasionally his lead character's \\"top five\\" lists can be a little annoying, this is a charmingly original, wry and thoughtful novel - an offbeat romance for our time.<br /><br />Rob owns a little music shop in London, which is a good thing because he is musically obsessed -- pop music, he claims, makes him fall in love. But even pop music can't heal his heart when his longtime girlfriend Laura breaks up and moves out. What's worse, Rob has no idea WHY she broke up with him, and he feels mixed feelings about losing her (he cares about her) and her musical tastes (bad).<br /><br />He immerses himself in his rickety business with his weirdo employees -- these guys alone are worth checking out the book for. He dates a folk singer. He learns that Laura is now involved with the repulsive guy upstairs. And finally, he assesses his past sex life and romances (the top five, specifically), getting a bit of insight into what Laura's problem with him might be: He's stuck in his mid-teens.<br /><br />Thirty-five is kind of old to start growing up. But like many real people, Rob learns that it's change or die -- in his case, alone and surrounded by records. \\"High Fidelity\\" is a nice blend of musical/movie memoir, love story and belated-coming-of-age tale. It's kind of geeky and pokes fun at itself, but therein lies its charm.<br /><br />Hornby writes a nice, breezy kind of prose, peppered with plenty of pop culture and musical references. Not to mention the top five lists: Top Five Episodes of Cheers. Best Side One Track Ones Of All Time. Top Five Bands or Musicians Who Will Have To Be Shot Come the Musical Revolution. At times the pop culture name-dropping gets a bit tiresome, but it mostly underlines how quirky and mildly obsessive Rob can be.<br /><br />And oh, he can be quirky. He can also be a self-centered jerk, and a bit confused and clueless to boot. Hornby's alter ego is likable for his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think. Good backup comes in his clerks Barry and Dick, who are just as geekily eccentric about music and lists as Rob is.<br /><br />Nick Hornby's \\"High Fidelity\\" is an excellent slice of Brit-lit -- it's quirky, wry, insightful, and a bit obsessed with good music.

B000A5044C|5.0|Brillant, poignant, a must see!!!  Rarely does a movie move me emotionally and visually to the point where pictures of it linger in my head for many days after.  The perfomances of the actors are amazing.  I felt as I was a fly on the wall watching actual  moments in these characters lives instead of watching a film.  Totally entrancing.   Brillantly filmed, acted and directed.
B000002GK1|5.0|This is a true classic. Much better than the entire grunge scene they were unfairly lumped into (because they showed up LONG before that started), Soundgarden made excellent recordings that have passed the test of time unlike most of the bands to come around that time in the US. Badmotorfinger is their best recording. It's much better in every aspect to all of their previous albums and EPs; and heavier and faster than the wonderful and more accessible Superunknown and the somewhat lacking Down on the Upside. I started listening to Soundgarden when I heard their awesome \\"Birth Ritual\\" back in 1992, which was obviously taken from the Badmotorfinger sessions. I still listen to all of their stuff and I feel it's better than Audioslave- but that doesn't mean Audioslave is bad- not at all. Actually, considering how the music scene is right now Audioslave is one of the best bands you can listen to.
0380002930|5.0|Finishing a very good book is always bittersweet.  I finished \\"Watership Down\\" in awe of how well the story was written, wishing that the 400+ pages would have continued on to book two.  Alas, the story is self-sufficient, and another story would be but a shadow of this epic.<br /><br />We meet Hazel and his brother Fiver as the story begins.  We will soon learn that Hazel is quite intelligent and Fiver can foresee the future.  Both Hazel and Fiver are outskirters in Sandelford Warren, and the Owsla, which are the large rabbits of the ruling class, typically push Hazel and Fiver around.  However, there are strange things going on in the commons around Sandelford Warren, and Fiver senses that everyone must leave.  Hazel and Fiver go to see the Chief Rabbit and attempt to convince him that the warren is in danger, though Fiver is unable to explain the nature of the danger.  The Chief Rabbit does not believe Fiver's story, but Hazel is impressed with his brother's fear and decides that they must leave the warren.<br /><br />A small group of bucks, male rabbits, join Hazel and Fiver as they make their way into the unknown.  Fortunately for the group, Bigwig, a former member of the Sandelford Warren's Owsla, has decided to join them, along with several other members of the warren.  The journey to Watership Down is fraught with danger for the rabbits.  There are elil, which is what rabbits call all creatures that hunt rabbits, everywhere.  Yet, after a misadventure in an anarchistic warren where the rabbits are allowed to run free, but are harvested by a man, the Sandelford Warren rabbits make their way to Watership Down and build a new burrow.<br /><br />The warren at Watership Down has but one problem; there are no does.  A warren requires does to stay alive, and the rabbits go off to seek does from Efrafa, run by the dictatorial General Woundwort, and from Nuthanger Farm, where rabbits are kept in hutches.  It is the epic story of the encounters with the Efrafan rabbits and General Woundwort that will provide any reader with an excellent reading experience and make you wish for more as the last page lays flat.<br /><br />The story of the rabbits is well-written and has some factual basis.

B00002ND77|4.0|It just a shame that a super talent like Denzel can't find a good film like this to sink his teeth into again.  He's just wasted in the contrived drama's he's been doing lately.  He did such a super job in this movie (he made Malcolm almost likeable).  I really enjoyed this movie even though I don't know how entirely accurate it was fact wise, but,thanks to Denzel, it was a terrific movie. Enjoy
B000AMPZGC|3.0|I gave this 3 stars becouse some of the songs are absoulutly wonderful, beyond a doubt, Tears to shed is a perfect example, however some of the songs are pathetic as well.  However I got this just for the tears to shed song so it really dosn't help to show that the bad songs should keep you from buying it now dose it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Went to see them when they came in concert they are awesome live. They are a great band and for the person who is trying to compare them to a punk band get a clue. Linkin Park isn't a punk band it's mix of hard rock and rap and for all the bashers saying that Chester can't sing that's insane to even comment something like that. He can too especially the song My December and Breaking The Habit come to mind. Yes, he does scream when he sings on some songs but it's better then listening to the bands who just scream and can't even make music.
B00005BL2A|5.0|This is a 4 year late review on Depeche Mode's best... that's right.. BEST album.  Okay, 'Violator' and 'Exciter' can duke it out, but if you can't at least appreciate the serenity and sexiness of this album, I feel sorry for you.  With 'Playing the Angel' due up in a week or so, I felt like reiterating how surprisingly pleased I was with this album when I first listened to it.  This is a dark, soft, go to bed album, yes, contrary from what you have come to expect from Depeche Mode in many ways (but not all ways; this album isn't a COMPLETE surprise). In accomplishing that different feel, it was done brilliantly.... absolutley excellent.  If you're a guy reading this, play \\"Dream On\\", \\"Shine\\", \\"When The Body Speaks\\", \\"Freelove\\", and \\"Breathe\\", and your date will be bedazzled with music pheromones... haha.. okay, okay.. don't get me wrong, this is coming from a guy who loves Mudvayne and Disturbed, but this album is absolute quality in softer, darker, Cure-like somberness.  Okay, I'll give you haters the point that the lyrics can be sappy in parts, but I really didn't notice it amidst all the great sounds, beats, and vocals melodies.  If you like the Cure, Coldplay, Dredg, Deftones and good music, you should pick up this album... again.

They can evoke feelings of joy and insperation to follow your dreams as well as deeper feelings of thinking that you are different and alone but in reality we are all the same.  I have seen the show 5 times between New York and Chicago and have given the CD to friends and family to enjoy even if they haven't seen the show.  As a CD it stands on its own as a GREAT body of music not just another musical soundtrack.
B0001HLVSC|4.0|Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is an all-male, testosterone-fueled, seafaring adventure about a British naval captain who plays a cat-and-mouse game with a faster, more advanced French warship.  The time of the film is 1805, when Napoleon was seeking to conquer Europe, and England had declared war.  The film is based on the historical fiction novels of the same title by Patrick O'Brian.<br /><br />Russel Crowe heads an excellent cast as Captain \\"Lucky Jack\\" Jack Aubrey, a hard-headed, disciplined military man bent on capturing the Archeron at all costs.  Paul Bettany plays Aubrey's opposite, a gentle, intellectual doctor who is ship surgeon and naturalist.  Maturin and Aubrey are constantly butting heads, making M & C kind of a high-seas buddy pic.<br /><br />The story is tightly paced and the music score is low-key.  It is music you might expect to hear watching a chess match, rather than swelling orchestral strains one expects during these types of historical pictures.  But indeed, the deadly stalking of the two ships is very much like a chess game.<br /><br />I loved this exciting, old-fashioned movie.<br /><br />The film is available to watch in Spanish and French dubs and subs.<br /><br />Unless you have a remote on whatever machine you are watching this DVD on, you cannot access special features.  I watch mine on a laptop, so I was out of luck.  Shame on the DVD designers for this poor menu design.  The only thing I could access was something called an \\"Inside Look\\" that I thought was an inside look at the film.  Instead, it was just previews!  Boo!<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000AV2G3I|4.0|To call this 38-track collection definitive is a bit presumptuous, but it is the most thorough anthology currently available.  My only complaint is the short shrift given to Lennon's rockers like \\"Well Well Well\\" or \\"Bring on the Lucie (Freda People)\\" and non-album B-sides like \\"Move Over Ms. L.\\" But overall this is a rewarding collection of songs.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000683VI4|4.0|Boy meets girl. They fall in love. Parents step in (the Montegues? The Capulets?) and break them up. The mother denies her daughter the letters the boy writes. Girl finds boy. They fall in love again.<br /><br />Maybe the oldest plot in the book and well done by Nick Cassevetes (that's right, John's son) directing his mom Gena Rowlands in this monster tear jerker. Guys. This is the movie you rent for your girlfriend when she's not feeling well and then you sit there praying \\"Dear God, let this be over soon.\\"<br /><br />Only kidding. Nice job by all concerned. James Garner as always is excellent, reading for community service in a hospital for terminally dementia ridden adults. He reads for Gena. It takes about 4 minutes to figure out what that's all about, and he reads a story about two ill crossed lovers.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams (she was in \\"The Hot Chick;\\" Now she is one) is the fiery, opinionated, passionate, lovely, goofy, heart-on-her-sleeve, highly intelligent girl, and Ryan Gosling is the small town boy who works at the lumberyard with whom she falls in love.<br /><br />My only criticism is that Gosling is one dimensional compared to the firebrand that is McAdams. She plays Mozart. It would be nice if he played, I don't know, bluegrass? He doesn't seem to do anything but stare at her for 90 minutes. Well. She's good looking. But I was left with the question 'what does she see in him?'<br /><br />Good flick. Old story done well. Not great. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|I bought behemoth's \\"demigod\\" two days after it was released and havent left my cdplayer yet... I mean, all the songs are truly refreshing to hear, and the lirycs are actullie very, very intelligent  msking  those other idiots, that think they make deathmetal look  all ignorant-- like they realy are and im so happy i support true dm and not gay poser untalent crap like mortician,canniball coprse, etc...  Highly recommended
B00000JRTX|3.0|IF you don't read the printed insert (which gives away all the jokes and comic situations and thus spoils the movie) and IF you don't mind Hugh Grant's excruciating method of delivering his lines (which grind the pace almost to a standstill every time he's on screen), you'll enjoy this movie.  It's a look at life among the British hipper class, and many of the gags really happened to the screenwriter at actual weddings.   <br /> <br />Andie MacDowell is a delight in her usual quiet way, and the rest of the supporting cast add spice to this tasty confection.   <br /> <br />If Hugh Grant would work with a speech therapist, he might become as charming as he thinks he is.  With another lead, I would have given the movie four stars.   <br />
0060958324|5.0|This book single-handedly rekindled my interest in reading.  Through college, I had essentially stopped reading anything except my texts for class, but decided to borrow this from a friend on his recommendation as I traveled through Europe after graduation. <br /> <br />I can't even call it a page-turner, because there were so many times when I just had to close the book and sit there and THINK about the passage I had just read.  Sometimes for 15 minutes or more.  I went to bed each night of that trip thinking about what I'd read from Zen/Motorcycle earlier that day.  The first book I recommend to my traveling friends.  It's one of the greatest books I have ever read.
B000065VB0|4.0|Firstly I must admit I had low expectations of this album having only really thought of Gabriel in the context of `sledgehammer' (you couldn't escape THAT video in the 80's) I purchased this album on vinyl for a pound (beat that Amazon!) and filed it away in my collection, one wet Sunday afternoon I was bored and needed something to soundtrack the washing up so after rummaging through my collection for what seemed like an eternity nothing was grabbing me (it takes a certain type of record to wash up to, and don't get me started on vacuuming) by chance I decided to give melt a spin and it blew me away,  from the pounding drum pattern of  `intruder' , a stalkers anthem if ever there was one,  (you'll notice them at concerts instead of lighters they wave torches), this is a quite unique song where Gabriel sounds a little to much in character but it works to great effect and sets the tone for much of the record if  not sonically, although see's  the start of a percussion ban throughout, so cymbal and high hat lovers will be ever so dissapointed `Family snapshot' is another fave were again Gabriel adopts a persona this time of an assassin awaiting his target,` and though the wire' featuring, if slightly oddly Paul Weller on guitar not that you'd notice, it's hardly Eddie van halen soloing on Billie jean, `games without frontiers' featuring the always reliable Kate bush was the big hit which I had heard before though not realising it was on this album, in truth the albums works on every level, hangs together well as a piece, lyrically unusual (no-where is baby rhymed with maybe) and all the better for it, sonically it sounds fresh even inventive drumming is great, (this was when Phil Collins was just a drummer, if only he'd stayed there...)  on the basis of this I bought Gabriel two (scratch) but it doesn't compare to this album a gem if ever I've  heard one.  highly recommended.
B0006L16N8|2.0|What is the deal?  These guys do not rock.  This album isn't cool.  I was forced to listen to it on a car trip and I was not impressed.  There is not one catchy song.  Nothing really rocks.  The lyrics are faux deep and uninspiring.  Chris martin is a tool.  He should do some drugs or something.  I'm sick of his supposed \\"fairy-tale\\" romance to Gwyneth Paltrow (she looks kind of ratty these days anyway).  I hate when we have to see some self-satisfied gazillionaire sigh complacently about how she has found true love with some sensitive man whatever just stop it.  I hope he gets caught with his pants down with some 19 year-old groupie in a coke orgy.  Plus, Chris, knock it off with the fair-trade nonsense.  If you really believed in that tripe you should follow through with it in your own life.  In that case you should have been paid like $500 total for making this flat can of Shasta of an album.  Coldplay sucks.

6304698690|2.0|It is a shame that so many people have been misled into buying this movie with claims that it is the best movie version of the book (although it may have been when this movie came out).  Now, however, the best movie version of the book is in fact the BBC version, which has just been released on DVD.  It is three and a half hours long and dramatizes the whole book.  The scenery is authentic, the accents are authentic, the characters and dialogue are literally taken from the book.  More important, it is a moving, touching version that will inspire you and your children.  It is a treasure.      The present version is promoted mainly with claims that the filmmaker is a great filmmaker.  Have you seen any of those \\"great\\" films, like Europa, Europa or Olivier Olivier?  They are typical of European films, depressed and depressing with neurotic characters, etc.  The filmmaker has approached The Secret Garden by throwing out all the characters from the book and replacing them with her own brand of neurotic characters.  See it if this is what you like, but don't call it great, just say, \\"I like this kind of thing.\\"  But beware of letting your children see it, unless you want to turn them into neurotic (or at least \\"problem\\") children.  (See the review further down where a mother describes the effects of this movie on her little girl.)    Botton line: Don't be misled into buying this movie; and if you've already bought it, buy the BBC version anyway.  You'll never watch this version again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is awesome I grew up with star trek, and old gunsmoke reruns. It's like both shows with the dry wit of buffy.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This album is very well produced.This album wasn't THAT big because of what happened on 9/11,but it sure beats Oops!.Oops!...I Did It Again has got to be Britey's worst!!!This album kinda makes you forget that Britney even made an album called Oops!Songs like I'm A Slave 4 U,Overprotected,Not A Girl,Not Yet A Woman,Lonely,Boys,Cinderella and Let Me Be make this album a keeper.Although on some songs she sounds like she's choking on something.Listen to Cinderella on your Walkman(CD Player)and you'll see what I mean.I did,and it hurt my ear.But still a great song if you listen to it on you stereo.Overall Britney gets +100/10 for not only singing,dancing but for also co-writing some of the songs.FINALLY!!!Hopefully on her next album she wrote all of her songs!!! And for the reviewer that wrote \\"gr8 job\\",you're not Britney's numba 1 fan,I Am!!!!And you'll just have to deal wit' it!!!!
B00006IUL7|3.0|The DVD features great video quality but the sound was a tad too muffled at times. Moving on, the film reminds me of Se7en in a few ways with lesser chilling scenes. Because of my diehard love for Hilary Swank, I wish she had more of a role or had been completely left out. Robin Williams is good at times but I really don't think he's the ideal person for the villain slot. The hero of the film is Al Pacino who acted pretty good. The 24hour day theme in the film was very good and the locations were good too. I liked how the film played around with guilt and duty.<br /><br />Overall a good film but I've seen better.<br /><br />Some others films you will want to watch if you like this film are \\"One Hour Photo\\" , \\"Heat\\" , \\"Seven\\" and \\"Along Came The Spider\\"
0061020710|5.0|\\"The color of magic\\" is Terry Pratchett's first novel in his acclaimed Discworld series. The series have so far more than thirty books, with different \\"main characters\\" strings. This first book features the wizard Rincewind as its main character, serving as a kind of host to Twoflower, a rich and somewhat naive tourist in Discworld's main continent.<br /><br />This book is full of Pratchett's acid british humour. The story is fun to read, at an easy pace, as the author describe his incredible settings, a world in the shape of a long-play (rotating in its axe, of course) set on the backs of four elephants that for their turn stand on the shell of a more-than-giant gallactic turtle (the Great A'Tuin) swimming through the void.<br /><br />Rincewind is a complete failure as a magician, yet he hides inside himself a power not even he can understand. Along with Twoflower, they go over many of the amazing places of the Discworld, like the Edge or the upside-down giant moutain (Wyrm) that serves as lair for hundreds of dragons, always facing near-death situations and meeting recurrent characters in the series, like Mort.<br /><br />\\"The color of magic\\" starts slow, but quickly improves and is sure to hook readers that enjoy well-written fantasy books, with the kind of humour that is similar to Pratchett's fellow countrymen Douglas Adams and the Monty Python gang.<br /><br />Grade 8.8/10
B000002L75|4.0|'some great reward' is perhaps depeche mode's funniest album title. as the band inched closer and closer to the global domination that would one day be theirs, one can help but wonder if a be-skirted martin looked at sun-in'd-bangs dave and said, 'is this all we get?'  or maybe it's the bands nod to its increasing fanbase, or a middle-finger to those who thought there were going to get another mildly poppy, pleasant, inoffensive DM album (though it started with 'construction time again, let's face it, this was the death knell of the 'photograph of you,' 'see you,' 'new life,' 'just can't get enough' dm brand of music).<br /><br />no, no, dear friends, this wasn't your daddy's dm.  suddenly martin was clad in s&m gear, handcuffs, leather (or was it pleather?), dave put a little sun-in in his hair, alan was a full-feldged member, and fletch, well, he was fletch (pushing his mic back and forth on stage and little else).  'some great reward,' i believe, was the blueprint for albums like 'pretty hate machine,' everything nitzer ebb did do, front 242 would do, and spawned a generation of knock offs (red flag, seven red seven, cause and effect). 'industrial' music? it started with 'some great reward.'<br /><br />'some great reward' is the album that came to define the depeche mode *sound.* it's cold and detached, it's pervy undertones bubbling just below the surface.  from the get-go 'some great reward' sounds like an album recorded squarely under the fist of the iron curtain.  'something to do' sounds like heavy machinery dropped off a 100ft ledge--agressive and relentless. 'lie to me' and 'if you want' drip in ambiguous sexuality.  of course there's 'master and servant' and it's fairly blatant s&m references and 'blasphemous rumors' in which martin (?) questions God's role in every day life. i'll forgive martin for 'somebody'--a song so sweet it should by right come packaged with a tube of toothpaste and mouthwash.<br /><br />'some great reward' pointed DM in a new direction they would later build on with 'black celebration,' 'music for the masses,' and culminate with 'violator.' in this regard it serves as an important stepping stone in the band's evolution--it was a precursor to the defining DM sound.  perhaps that reason alone is enough to merit buying this album. and if that reason's not enough, it's still got some KILLER songs, truly memorable singles, and just enough dark matter to keep the trenchcoat kids and enough catchy melodies and verses to keep the preppy polo-wearing goofs happy.ild on with 'black celebration,' 'music for the masses,' and culminate with 'violator.' in this regard it serves as an important stepping stone in the band's evolution--it was a precursor to the defining DM sound.  perhaps that reason alone is enough to merit buying this album. and if that reason's not enough, it's still got some KILLER songs, truly memorable singles, and just enough dark matter to keep the trenchcoat kids and enough catchy melodies and verses to keep the preppy polo-wearing goofs happy.
B000AAF1U4|4.0|Okay, its a good movie....but don't buy it again!!!!! The movie studios should be ashamed of themselves. The only way to get the studios to stop releasing, re-releasing then renaming and releasing again is NOT TO BUY.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I feel like everytime I watch it I gain something from it.  They bring up a lot of subjects that I was already previously interested in such as Existentialsim and Lucid Dreaming.  You really have to watch it a few times though because theres always something you missed the last time you watched it.  The animation can be distracting at times, but other times it really adds to it.  I think the reason for this is because sometimes a lot of philosophical talk can get boring this way the movie grabs your attention a little bit more. There is some humor in it so it isnt all talk.  The first time I watched this I was with my boyfriend and it was the first time we actually sat and watched a movie all the way through.
B00005JO0J|5.0|This movie has it all: action, humor, mystery, great characters, drama. Such quality has been absent in recent memory, especially in the Sci-Fi genere. Do yourself and favor and go see this movie!

630027179X|5.0|This 1981 classic sees Nigel Terry perfectly cast as King Arthur, who as a squire draws the sword Excalibur from the stone to become king. After tricking Merlin to allow a knight to pose as Morgana's father, Igraine bears Arthur, who is taken  by Merlin. After Uryins pledges fealty to Arthur, the new king forms his Knights of the Round Table. Lancelot has an affair with Arthur's wife Gwenevere, and Morgana traps Merlin with his own spell. Morgana transforms into Gwnevere to bear a son Mordred, who tries to take Camelot by force. Perceval is the only knight to take the Holy Grail after escaping Mordred's plot and finds Lancelot old and befuddled. The ending is classic, as the knights ride to battle Mordred one last time. The best knights in armor movie ever made. Based on Sir Thomas Malory's La  Morte Darthur, which means Death of Arthur. Excalibur is French for \\"sword of power.\\"
B00079ZACM|4.0|The MGM DVD edition appears to be a cut edition of this movie. I believe the runtime should be 130 minutes. It's a shame if MGM chose to release this in an abbreviated form.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I was 14 when Cream performed their farewell concert at Royal Albert Hall.  They came upon the late 60's music scene so fast, and said \\"Goodbye\\" even faster, after only four albums in less than three years.  They obviously had other fish to fry, but I do wonder what they could have accomplished if they had remained together for a few more years.  This DVD is absolutely amazing!  The sound and video quality are outstanding.  Cream is just as good or better now, after more than 35 years since their breakup.  I only wish that Cream would perform in Texas, and not limit their United States tour to New York's Madison Square Garden.  I never saw them live during their heyday, but resolved to buy every album and subsequently wear them out on my stereo turntable.  Cream remains a dynamic rock/blues power trio, and with all due respect; it should be noted here that ZZ Top is the only rock/blues power trio to still be performing and recording after more than 35 years together.  Cream is at their absolute best on this DVD and I highly recommend it!  ROCK ON!
B00025ETIW|5.0|this cd rules, thats about it, if u like them or their singles ull love the album
B000062YAZ|5.0|As Angel of Death came roaring on the speakers of my car I realized that this CD was not going to be average, it was going to be freaking awsome.  I couldn't belive that the song was from 1986, it seemed so modern.  The rest of the songs roared by and I was genuinly hooked on this CD.  The second time listening through highlighted especially Criminally Insane and its remix, which actually sounds kind of scarey at the beginning using sound FX from Raining Blood.  Anyway, and Slayer or metal fan should enjoy this CD.  Anyone should enjoy it, unless they are put off by the alegid \\"satanic\\" nature of it.  It really is more like an anti-satanic album even if the songs are really cool.  Look at the front cover.  Is that really a pro-hell cover?  Not really.  Anyway, there are some songs on here that I think everyone can enjoy and have alot of fun with.  I'm really glad this was good after hearing Seasons in the Abyss, buying Divine Intervention, listening to Decade of Aggression, and hating God Hates Us All.  I think you'll like this one.
1573223026|5.0|I'd never really heard of Hornby before, but because his last name reminded me of \\"horny,\\" I thought his book would probably contain the unwonderful subjects of relationships and some graphic sex scenes and I was ready to look down to him. <br /> <br />Unexpectedly, I grew addicted to this book and couldn't put it down. It is realistic but at the same time poetic, and I thought it was amazing the way Hornby could write from four different point of views of four very different people. The book also managed to make me laugh out loud every so often, and any books that could do that will always get a thumbs-up from me. <br /> <br />Granted, there are literally a thousand profanity in this book (I counted), which may threw off some people. But otherwise, it's a great book.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|First, like many other reviewers said, stupid copy protection program is really bothersome. Actually I've seen other people who downloaded the files and listening. I felt something is definately wrong. Although there are some wma form of the music is provided from the CD, it does not work in my IAUDIO mp3 player. One embrassing thing is the company which made this CD provides an e-mail address of Apple, so I can send a complaint to Apple because IPOD does not support those weird WMA files. OK. then I need to send a complaint mail to Cowon which made my mp3 player. Then how long should I wait to listen the music with my mp3 player? I should have bought mp3 form of CD.<br /><br />Regarding with the music.. This is the first time I bought foo fighter's album. And I realized I cannot be a big fan of them. To me, sound quality of each song is not good. It sounds like I am listening the songs from radio, not from CD player. Well, it has been only couple of days since I bought the CD, but I experienced too much BAD things already. It was not a best buy definately.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I never really watched any shows on UPN.  I only started watching this show in the off season because I heard some good reviews about it.  One episode and I was addicted.  Bell is just has \\"it\\".  That thing that makes you pay attention when she's on screen.  I highly recommend buying this show on DVD.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney never lost his talent for writing and performing great music, but he is his own worst enemy.  By subduing his ego and listening to producer Nigel Godrich, he has managed to make an album without any filler for the first time since the Beatles fell apart.  Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is not an artistic masterpiece and it could use a few upbeat songs to balance it out, but it grows on you after repeated listenings and you don't miss them.  Each song is tastefully done without the overdone background vocals or the silly lyrics found on all of his other CDs.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|Paul Simon's \\"The Rhythm of the Saints\\" opens with the explosive percussion of the \\"The Obvious Child\\" and refuses to let go of this energy until the album closes. Simon is one of the best arrangers in the last fifty years, and by his unusual but great compositions he manages to transcend the easy title of \\"world music\\" in this album and in his earlier \\"Graceland.\\"  <br /> <br />The lyrics are also interesting in this album. Even after reading the lyrics in the booklet, I can't say what many of the songs are about. But like many good songwriters (Bob Dylan in particular), the words Simon writes still manage to provoke a response from the listener and force him to make an attempt to dig deeper. Simon also has a knack for writing songs with despairing lyrics and composing it with sharp pop hooks, something that makes his music that much more interesting to listen to. <br /> <br />\\"Is this better than 'Graceland?'\\" is the question many people ask before listening to the album. After listening to both, I can honestly say that this is the better album. While \\"Graceland\\" is still one of Simon's best, it still has a tinny, '80s sound to some of it. The music in \\"Saints\\" is perfectly full. This is a rich, dense album that is simply a lot of fun to listen to. <br /> <br />This is one of the few albums that I can say really gets better every time I hear it.
0613846044|5.0|Greetings from Germany. <br />I am german and I've read the german book. I do not know how good the translation to english is done but the book is much more complex than the first movie maybe because they weren't able to film all the details because of the technical status back in 1984 but I love both the movie and the book. I first saw the movie when I was 5 years old and for me it appeared to be real until my mother told me that it wasn't. I really got into the movie and I still do the same way when I watch it. At the end of 2004 I read the book and I found out that there were some minor differences between the storyline of the movie and the book. The first movie shows only about one half of the book and the second movie shows a lo of the second part but not as close to the book as the first one and it does not have the deepness of the first because there are other actors and a classic soundtrack like in the first movie is missing. For me !!! Noah Hathaway !!! is the best Atrju (german pronounciation), Barret Oliver is the best Bastian and Tami Stronach is the best Childlike Empress! The book is really enhancing the movie and is changing and deepening some details. I really love it like I love the first movie and its soundtrack. Maybe I'll purchaise the english book some day to find out the quality of translation. <br />Thank you for your attention and I hope this review is a helping hand.

0740748475|5.0|These are words I have longed to hear: \\"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, I have all the previous collections, in their various iterations, but when that big hardcover \\"Complete Far Side\\" came out a few years ago, THIS was the one strip I had hoped somebody would compile. And here it is. <br /> <br />I can't imagine anyone reading this far in this review who would have no exposure to this tyke and his tiger, but if you are in this small, lamentable cohort, you are among the luckiest people on Earth. You get to discover all this, all at once, much to your delight. <br /> <br />The only real precursor to C&H is \\"Peanuts\\" (also being lovingly collected in beautiful hardcovers), with the deceptively simple lines and boundless imagination. However, in direct contradistinction to that strip, Calvin has never been fully merchandised. Everything that is \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\" is right here. It's a world that had a beginning and an end. It is self-contained. <br /> <br />And...it's funnier. <br /> <br />What you get here is three large, exquisitely detailed tomes filled with the most hilarious, hysterical, touching and surprising stories you'll ever read.  <br /> <br />Prose, poetry, film, comic books...just like those media, these are also complete stories. Some are told in three panels, some across weeks. Some are told magically in a single wordless panel. Wit, pathos, drama, suspense...even science fiction...all here, and all woven effortlessly and seamlessly together by Bill Watterson. <br /> <br />The construction of the book itself is something to behold. The binding is hefty, the paper thick and lustrous. The color reproductions are gorgeous. All contained in an illustrated slipcase. <br /> <br />I can't say enough about the strip itself. I don't think I've ever laughed harder at anything in my life. I've seen funny movies, heard comedians give killer lines during stand-up...but the convulsive, explosive laughter that this little guy generates is, I believe, unique. <br /> <br />This is something a lot of people will treasure for the rest of their lives. You will want your kids to read this. And their kids. <br /> <br />Now they'll be able to!
B000002UA0|5.0|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967.) Pink Floyd's first album.<br /><br />In the mid-60s, taking their name from blues musicians Pink Anderson & Floyd Council, juggernaunt '70s rock band Pink Floyd started out as an R&B pair. It was then Singer/Guitarist Syd Barret took them into new measures with the Psychadellic scene at the time. Bassist Roger Waters couldn't refuse to agree with this, and the band went onforth to the studio to create some songs. How does this, their first album measure up with the likes of later albums like 'Dark Side of the Moon', 'Wish You Were Here', and 'The Wall'? Find out shortly!<br /><br />In conclusion, this album is almost NOTHING like the Pink Floyd you've come to know & love. This is Syd Barrett leading the band, NOT the duo of David Gilmour & Roger Waters that so many people know. Actually, this is one of their most praised albums by many fans. You WILL be surprised if you're just a casual fan most defeniatly, though. It IS just as good as the later albums. Ok, enough of that, on with the songs. 'Astronomy Domine' is a classic album opener that is also the most well-known song on PATGOD. The song starts off with an astrounaunt that speaks about who knows what, along with Barret's '50s-esque guiar riffs & Nick Mason's sweet drum pounding. With Barret & Waters' vocal harmonies added to the mix, this song is absolutely a Floyd classic. Next up is 'Lucifer Sam', a creepy Gothic Pop song that is one of many underrated songs on the album. Barrett uses his British accented singing voice for many of the songs on here, and this is one of them. Third, we have 'Matilda Mother', which is another fairly creepy Goth-Pop Rock song which doesn't fail to please. 'Flaming', while a bit on the short side, is another excellent tune, with some nice guitar chops. Next up is 'Pow R. Toc H.', which is by far the weakest track on the album. It isn't that bad, but all it basically is is animal noises & some acoustic picking. You might feel like you've gotten abducted into the jungle when you hear this one! 'Take Up Thy Stethoscope & Walk' is another Psychadellic Pop/Rock masterpiece which is easily one of my favorites on the album. Another well loved track, the very awkward long instrumental track, 'Interstellar Overdrive', is up next. This is arguably the greatest song on the album, despite some awkwardness. It starts off as a short jam session, then leads into a noisy guitar part. It turns back into an excellent rocer in the end, with great results. Barrett was a great, troubeled drug-minded genius of the band. He could've stayed a bit longer! Anyway, the next few tracks, 'The Gnome', 'Chapter 24', & 'Scarecrow' are all short, mostly accapella Psychadellic Pop/Folk songs. Think of the Beatles & the Byrds with a lot more acid and these songs are what you'll get! The album's closer, 'Bike', is another well-loved song on here. A catchy Pop/Rock song with some childish lyrics, this is yet another classic on here. At the end, there's some more funny sounds. Alright, now, onto more of this review. Syd Barrett was an absolute GENIUS of the group, and him having to be with the band for only 1 album (though he contributes to about 2 songs on their second album, 'A Saucerful of Secrets') is a very sad thing. Oh well, he took too many drugs. I wonder if he's actually still alive? No offense intended. Anyway, if you're expecting Dark Side of the Moon or Animals, you ain't gettin' it here. (with the possible exception of Astronomy Domine) But, if you want to see where Pink Floyd started, as a Psychadellic Pop/Rock band that had some progression, defeniatly look here. I was pleasently surprised on how different it sounded when I first got it. It may not be quite Floyd's best, but Syd Barrett sure did them a lot of justice when they recorded this. Ok, I'm almost done.<br /><br />STRONGLY RECCOMENDED TO FANS OF PINK FLOYD, '60S PSYCHADELLIA, GOTHIC POP/ROCK, '60S & '70S MUSIC IN GENERAL, & SYD BARRETT!

This film is a beautifully told story about strength, courage, honor, family, and faith. It deals with cultural identity, gender prejudice, and overcoming adversity.<br /><br />This is a feel good family movie that can spark many teaching situation conversations with your kids. If you don't have this movie, you should.
B000002N2N|5.0|\\"It's Alive\\" is the Ramones, one of the greatest live bands ever, performing at the peak of their powers, and it is simply awesome.<br /><br />A lot of great live bands somehow never managed to capture the magic on vinyl or cd. Thankfully that is not the case with the Ramones.
B000A88F22|3.0|People that haven't even seen this show shouldn't review it.  Sure, it's a little uncanny from the typical reality TV shows, but are shows like Newlyweds and Big Brother really reality?  Not really, they're glossed-up versions.  Britney's short-lived UPN (honestly, that's a major reason the show didn't do so awesome) Chaotic series, taken mostly by her personal camcorder, is more reality than almost any other reality show has been; it's real, upfront and honest, not glistened by production editing teams that includes background music and crazy psychotic special effects.  Sure, I don't think this show thing was that good of an idea (you are above reality TV, Britney), but \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\" makes this package worth the money as it is Britney's best song if you ask me (she even wrote it herself, like \\"Everytime\\" - only this is MUCH more listenable).  Like her or not, Britney Spears' power to persuade (even negative attention as with Chaotic) makes her a true musical force to be reckoned with.

B00005JKNC|4.0|The Majestic takes place during the McCarthy Trials, or witch hunts, of the 1950s. The film revolves around a b-movie writer played by Jim Carrey who is blacklisted. However, on a drunken binge, he has an accident and washes ashore with amnesia in a small town mourning the loss of their young boys from World War II. They mistake Carrey as Luke, one of the most beloved, and adopt him.<br /><br />This sort of kitschy, heartwarming story is good, but loses some of its effect because of the cheesy, inspirational music, warm family moment, and exaggerated political morals.<br /><br />The film is framed by Carrey looking off into space listening to the Hollywood moguls change his film to be more glamorous. The scenes serve as competent bookends that play very effectively and display the changes in the character.<br /><br />There is a scene with gorgeous yet obviously fake sunset background. It looks like a beautiful painting.<br /><br />Historically, the film is somewhat flawed in several ways. Almost every movie that attempts to create a film, a Hollywood name, or anything involving old Hollywood fails miserably. The B-movie Sand Pirates of the Sahara is no exception. The acting is fake and exaggerated and lends itself to the misconception that classic films are overly stagy and elaborate. However, the music is accurate. The McCarthy Trials themselves are somewhat misrepresented. Those involved were incredibly vicious to those being questioned, especially if they did not cooperate in the implicated way, and this movie depicts the leaders as being lenient. Not so at all. Many careers were completely ruined because of suspected communist sympathies.<br /><br />This film displays tinges of a genuine love for old films and the theaters that housed them. The old man who runs the theater openly argues his distaste for television. The impact that films have, even small parts of films, is utilized. This film also effectively uses a clip from The Big Parade, a famous silent film about war. This clip shows that even films without sound have relevance in times in which most films do have it.<br /><br />The great thing about this movie is that it captures the atmosphere and attitudes of the time period, or at least the ideal of the time. The people in the town are friendly and willing to help each other. There is even one man who is more suspicious and unlike the others, but his character is common in classic films. The story itself is even old fashioned and one could picture Joel McCrea or Jimmy Stewart in the role that Carrey plays. The drawback is that even though the set-up is right for emulating a classic film, it is much too long. The scenes are long and drawn out instead of brief but poignant. They lose some of their strength this way. The scenes could have been more effective if they were cut off sooner because one always seems to be able to predict what will happen next since the scenario is not too strange or original.<br /><br />Jim Carrey does a great job at playing various emotions; perhaps the film did not do well upon release because audiences were so unaccustomed to thinking of Carrey as a dramatic star. He is and proves that he is a great actor. Laurie Holdon holds her own and has very cute scenes; she even hiccups believably.<br /><br />Overall, this film is good, although it could have been better.n films without sound have relevance in times in which most films do have it.

0783240287|5.0|It's funny, witty, and just so gosh darn catchy! I walked around humming these songs for days!  <br /> This movie is filled with little jokes and ridiculously simple stage props and scenary.(one example is that a scene where Joseph's brothers kill a goat, all it is is a stuffed animal, they simply take off the legs and call it dead!) <br /> <br />The music is very cute and well done. Andrew Lloyd Webber never fails to provide snappy yet dramatic melodies. <br /> <br />Donny Osmund is a fantastic actor who believably portrays Joseph from a young man in his late teens to a completely mature over 50 year old adult. He has done a brilliant job of being both funny and amazingly dramatic, and without confusing the two. He is very talented in his voice and was very pleasing to listen to. <br /> <br />  Joseph ATATD can also be good for parents trying to teach bible stories to their children. For one thing it gives a very good outline of the original bible story but it does it in a fun way without ever TRYING to. They would never know it was a bible story without being told so. <br />  <br /> This is one of my all time favorite plays and I hope one day i'll get to see it live!
B00063MBU8|1.0|So I'm not saying that I just sit in Starbucks all day drinking Frapiccinos and writing up reviews about how rock is being ruined by wannabe bands such as Simple Plan, (mainly because I haven't been around long) but this CD isn't a good investment.  The first two songs are basically the best, and naturally, the singles(not including that other single that I never even bothered with). ALL the songs sound the same past the point of \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Welcome To My Life.\\" \\"Jump\\" was just making me sick by the way. Those shouts of \\"JUMP!\\" running over the chorus ruined the song. I regreted buying this CD and so did everyone I know. They wouldn't be bad if they could make their songs sound different occasionally, but they don't, so Pierre's whiny voice gets monotonous. The same on their debut album, which had two good songs also. I'm serious, unless you want radio Disney 8 year old disgruntled rock, please, don't buy this.

B000001GY9|4.0|It's relatively easy to acquire either of Bernstein's Schumann symphony cycles--from Nyew York (1960) and Vienna (1984)--at mid-price, and real devotees may want both, since they ae considerably different. If I had to select the best single performances, I would choose Syms. 3 and 4 from the first cycle and Syms. 1 and 2 from the second. This, despite the delirious Scherzo from the NY Phil. in Sym. #2, one of the most exciting things from the younger Bernstein.<br /><br />In general, here are the key differences between the two sets as I hear them:<br /><br />Sound: There is a major difference here. The NY cycle was recorded in Manhattan Center, the venue of choice for the New York Phil. before Avery Fisher Hall was inaugurated. As usual, the orchestra sounds larger than life, with wide-ranging stereo separation, deep, prominent bass, and a combination of forward placement and lots of reverberation. As a result, Schumann's orchestral writing sounds heroic, on the same scale as Bernstein's famous 1964 Eroica, recorded under similar conditions.<br />  In Vienna 24 years later, sonices aren't better, only more modest. The cycle was ecorded live, and the orchestra is further away--the listener is sitting in the middle of the ahll. There is less inner detail as a result, and the sonics overall are much less splashy. This drier, smaller, more blended sound has less impact than the NY recordings, but the music is caught in correct proportion rather than being inflated.<br /><br />Interpretation: Bernstein in 1984 was more seasoned and some would say more somber than his younger self. He still conducts these symphonies with fervor and exuberance, but in NY he produced readings that were radiant and joyous. These are subjective terms, of course, and by any measue Bernstein was always involved with this music. The NY performances in general are a touch faster, but not enough to make a big difference.<br /><br />The big difference is an impalpable quality.  How can ou measure joy?  But one only has to listen to the first movement of the Rhenish Sym. (#3), which explodes from the speakers with exhiliration in the NY reading, to instantly recognize what is missing from the very fine Vienna one. For that reason, and since I am hooked on that huge NY sound, I rate the earlier cycle that much better than the Vienna one.the first movement of the Rhenish Sym.

0062502182|5.0|This book is very inspiring and hard to put down. It is short, so it can be read in a day. It is a good read for people who are at a crossroads in their life or if you are looking for some inspiration to follow a longing in your heart.
1592400876|5.0|This was just as witty, entertaining and informative as I had hoped it would be. Why the other reviewers that hated it would read a book about punctuation, while clearly eschewing all proscriptions  for its correct application is beyond me. It's like buying a kitten, and then being surprised and dismayed that it became a cat. Pooh, pooh to the critics of ES&L. May they receive enlightenment or ever wallow in their own ungrammatical slime.
0743454537|5.0|When my book club met to discuss this book last month, the first question asked was \\"How hard did you cry?\\". I personally feel that any story in which I can come to care about the characters so much that I am deeply moved by the events in their lives is an excellent and worthy read.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult does just that -- she draws you in to care about all the characters so that you feel just as conflicted as each individual in the story does about the difficult subject they are facing. The issues that Picoult tackled were large, weighty ones, and often I am skeptical of such ambitions, typically judging authors on their use of the subject as a cheap, cliched device. I did not feel that way with this novel.  I thought the issue was explored sensitively and moreover, that the characterization was at the forefront of the novel, which is what kept it from being a cheap storyline. It made for an interesting discussion about such a difficult and interesting issue.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Let me preface by saying that before randomly seeing \\"Serenity\\" while waiting for a flight departure, I had never heard of Joss Whedon or seen any of his creations.  Within 24 hours of seeing this film, however, I bought the Firefly series on DVD. <br /> <br />Anyone will tell you that Nathan Fillion as Captain Reynolds is the heart and soul of this film.  Reynolds is built in the Han Solo archetype, only grittier, funnier, more violent and just as charismatic.  Fillion and Ejiofor (as the cooly evil Operative) steal every scene in this film.  In fact, the film peaks whenever these two are sharing screentime. <br /> <br />The other actors are not in the same class, but the script and direction are so good that it is difficult to fault any aspect of the film. <br /> <br />This is one of those rare films that makes you want to buy another ticket right after seeing it.  <br /> <br />NOTE: Some reviewers have said that it is easy to get lost if you haven't seen \\"Firefly.\\"  Not true.  I didn't even know Firefly existed and I followed everything quite easily.
0060976624|4.0|I really didn't want to like it.  I wasn't so sure about reading from this perspective, was worried that it would be pro-smoking or try to make a cliched attempt at being anti-smoking.  And while I felt the ending and the big switchover was a bit contrived and quick, I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />I was a bit angry at becoming so involved with the main character, but it happened instantly when his major incident took place. I wasn't sure what my morals were doing, but my readerly instincts had me engaged with the character.  As soon as that happened, I was able to enjoy the light and sometimes humorous style of Christopher Buckley and make guesses as to which way the plot was going.  I enjoyed the unravelling of it all.<br /><br />All in all, a good read.

B000B0WODA|5.0|Franz are without a doubt my favorite group of my generation, and they outdid themselves with this album. 'The Fallen' is an absolute treasure lyrically, something you rarely get in pop music today. Very catchy music, thought provoking lyrics, a must have for all the anti-socials out there.
B000002KHH|5.0|Bow down to the kings of Metal, Black Sabbath is the best of all times!  WAR PIGS, PARANOID, IRON MAN, and ELECTRIC FUNERAL are the best tracks in this album.  Believe me, this CD will rock the house and melt your brain!  OZZY OSBOURNE FOREVER ROCKZ!!!

Well you would have to be a dud! Go on and buy it you won't regret it!!! The Bandit    Buddy does blow this album away when he is live, but I still feel it's worth the 12 or 13 bucks. I like the reviewer that said if you were a real Buddy Guy fan you would buy the CD without reading the reviews, I agree! I bought it the day it came out I have spun it about 6 times and it grows on me more and more. I just love having a huge collection by Buddy, Freddie, Stevie, BB, Albert and more. IMHO it's not as good as Sweet Tea!!!

B000AXSN5G|2.0|Boy, was I excited for the new Neil Young album, Prairie Wind. I'm a long time Neil fan, and even through rough patches (by which I mean insanity like Trans and Neil and the Shocking Pinks) he's always bounced back with something good. <br /> <br />Well, not this time. Coming off his latest rough patch (the Broadway show wanna-be Greendale) he moves right to another.  <br /> <br />I had high hopes for this album. I love Harvest and Harvest Moon! I bought Prairie Moon as soon as it was released. Damn, what a disappointment. You can hear some good songs in there, struggling to get out - but they're buried under unnecessary strings, horns, and choruses. <br /> <br />Produced by Ben Keith, (who also produced Harvest Moon, Comes a Time, American Stars & Bars, and Old Ways). In my opinion he ruined an album that had tons of potential.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I was watching this movie with a friend, hoping she'd like it as much as I did.  After ten minutes, she said, \\"What is it that you find remotely funny about this?\\"  Reading the reviews here, I'm equally puzzled why some people hate what I consider to be a masterpiece. <br /> <br />A movie gets to create its own universe.  That universe must be internally consistent, and follow its own rules.  Napoleon dynamite does this well, creating an entirely unique universe with no Hollywood cliches, no tear-jerking stereotypical themes.  For some people, that could mean that it lacks the signposts with which they are familiar, the action or the jokes or the themes that make something entertainment. <br /> <br />By refusing to adopt those stereotypes, the movie hits the viewer as a refreshing dose of reality.  Movie reality is usually a carefully woven script of lines that fit nicely together.  Napolean Dynamite is not.  It reminded me of all those times I felt out of place or alienated in high school, unable to say anything intelligent. <br /> <br />People who like the movie, I believe, have a taste for the unique and for the artistic, as opposed to the merely entertaining.  The movie is funny, but it works on a philosophical level as well.
B000AY807Q|5.0|...stealing cars and having a wife in every port?  No!  Not THAT Neil (Cassidy)!  I mean, he also admits he's doing always the same things: he is reassuring like a Holiday INside; at first when you start to listen to it (and I have to admit I'm just beginning to listen to this album) the intro notes sound like another song you've already heard, from Neil Young oceanic repertoire, of course!  But around the 5th song you're beginning to believe in this album as something of the best ones from Neil; let's forget how he uses the water of Country & Folk for his sound, or let the light of Rithm & Blues shines on, while the Rock & Roll wind blows: he is telling us some other new great stories and evocative dreams with nowhere to stay, except in his songs, that old seasoned Martin guitar popped out from its old case scratching and harmonising at its best, the misterious sound of the pedal guitar and the Hammond like from a deep inner spring, the compulsive and imaginative background vocals that colour the canvas of the painter (there is only One Painter!)... Thank you Neil for being Here!   Mind you, I'm still waiting to have a cleaned up CD of 'Time Fades Away', one of my favorite scratched_up_album, so you should know which kind of Neil Young's 'fan' I am...     Diego

B0006FO8RA|5.0|Britney Spears has done alot in the five years she has been in the music industry, she has paved the way for many younger artists, created trends, released some of the most memorable songs and has been married for 55 hours. Sure, she may not be the best role model but the fact is, it's about the music. The music is good and shows how much her voice has grown since her teenage years. Britney's music is very varied and her music from the ...Baby One More Time era to the Oops!....I Did It Again era is actually better than some of her most recent music.<br /><br />This collection is really essential to anyone who misses the 90's, who doesn't?, and brings back memories either good or bad. This music was the music of the 90's and ended the decade well.<br /><br />Britney paved the way for Christina, remember that fact it was Britney first. Sure it may be bubblegum pop in places but it really triggers the memories and reminds you of the last 5 years.<br /><br />The songs on this album are all classics and you really don't need a tracklisting at all as you will instantly recognise the songs. It contains some previously un-released material and some remixes. The album is so loaded with songs because Britney put out albums every year or so between the dates of 1999-2001.<br /><br />Most people will hate this album and won't even bother listening to the music. If they did they would most probably realize that this album is a really strong collection and that it flows really well. Controversial, sure but so is Madonna and look how many albums she has sold.
B00005JNTX|5.0|First of all, this isn't really a movie, it isn't really even a collection of short stories on film- and it wasn't intended to be! What this is, is practically a frame-by-frame reconstruction of three of the greatest graphic novels ever written. If you were looking for a \\"movie\\" then you probably ain't going to get it.<br /><br />If, however, like me you love the original Sin City graphic novels, then you are going to love this. It is pretty much a companion piece to the original artwork- and closer than I would have believed possible. Now if they can only do the same with Miller's \\"Dark Knight.\\"<br /><br />The spirit here is classic film noir- in fact, it's more noir than noir, yet without appearing campy. But yet, it isn't quite noir, because the attitude is clearly one of good vs. evil- and good wins. Good may get the hell beat out of it and resort to hyper violence, but it wins. It wins because the innocent are either protected or avenged. Yeah, maybe these are morality plays, but they are good morality plays. Marv was my hero before I saw this- and he is still my hero now: \\"That the best you can do, you Pansies?\\"<br /><br />The primary special feature here is an interview with Miller, the other directors, and the main actors. It is well done and their enthusiasm for the project shines through, which is unusual for Hollywood (the original \\"Sin City.\\")

Containing the arena hits \\"Bad Medicine\\" and \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\", this disc has something for everyone. <br /> <br />Jon and his great band shine on the ballads \\"Living in Sin\\" and \\"I'll Be There For You\\", while rockers will appreciate \\"Blood on Blood\\", a song about three best friends growing into adulthood, and the bluesy \\"Love For Sale\\". <br /> <br />Each song on this cd is excellent and is full of Bon Jovi's teriffic vocals, energy, and insturmentals.  I give this disc my highest recommendation. Play this disc and hear one of the 80's top bands perform some of their best songs.

I am a huge fan.<br /><br />So, understandably I was really excited about getting this album, so I ran right out and bought it.  I kept hearing that it was another Harvest and Harvest Moon.  Nope.<br /><br />When Neil is right on, he's right on.  When he isn't he seems to be struggling to get the songs out.  I get that feeling about this album.  I'm going to keep playing it to see if I'm missing something, but my sense is that it isn't going to be one of my favorite albums.
078062369X|5.0|This movie has to be one of the greatest action packed vampire movies of all time. It can't even be compared to the other movies of the trilogy. It is just that much better. Wesley Snipes plays the character of Blade (half vampire, half man)and has all the strenghs of a vampire, but none of the weakness of a man. He uses his power trying to make the whole vampire race extinct. Ending it with the ultimate fight against the head vampire.   <br />This movie is a very voilent one at that, but has to be. It incorporate many different martial arts and special effects, which only adds to the action.  This is a must see movie and establishes how action movies should be.

B000068PQ0|4.0|That's the only word to describe this band: \\"Futuristic.\\" Since some of you might not know of The Flaming Lips, their music is neat. It's really really strange. It's even tough to describe the sound of the music. The album itself revolves around a female named Yoshimi and her battles against pink robots, or at least 2 songs do. Like many other bands, it's weird, and that's what's so wonderful about it. I'm most likely sure these guys are still together and will keep making albums in time!
B000AJJNPY|4.0|so this album is totally very, very good. like, on the great side of good. but not amazing (like their second album \\"agaetis byrjun\\"). it sounds like the singer has inhaled much more helium than usual, as there is much more falsetto on this record. the album is also a bit uplifiting (i.e. most of the songs sound kind of on the hopeful side of melancholy, or downright happy.) not to say this is a bad thing at all, just, for me, not as powerful as the deeply somber second album. definitely WAY better than the pretentiously titled (and packaged) third album \\"()\\", which was on the boring side of opus. \\"takk\\"'s songs are more on the accessible side (if such a thing is possible for sigur ros), which sort of makes them lose some of their magic. all in all, this is still one of the top 10 albums released this year.
0740748475|5.0|This is wonderful! - Calvin and Hobbes have been one of my favourite cartoon strips ever. It is one of those great strips that can be read on more than one level, which makes it appealing to more than one audience. It was also really well drawn. And in this edition they have collected them all up and presented them just beautifully.    Cynically I imagine that this has been done for the money, but then I think who really cares about the motivation if the outcome is so nice?    The everyday fantasy world which 6 year Calvin lives in, inhabited by his tiger friend Hobbes very much reflects the deeper issues of the world. The problems with society, life, growing up and just existing are all examined through Calvin's naive and slightly delinquent eyes.     Watterson illustrates so beautifully - it really takes me back to my own childhood- in how teh characters are drawn, the perspectives in the drawing and also in the point of view. You can also see the adult and the child in Hobbes.    But then why am I explaining the philosophy of C&H? People looking at this book will defintely be fans already so there is no need to sell the strip itself. So to the presentation and the binding...... this is an absolutely grogeous binding making it a beautifully and collectable, item for fans of the strip already. After all, no one is going to fork out this sort of money for anything less.    So my opinion of this....as I said binding is gorgeous, love the slip case, and it is going to be kept in a good dark well aired corner of my bookshelves to keep in in absolutely pristine condition. This has not been designed as something just to browse through, it is in three volumes which arecumbersome to handle. If you do look at them you really need to do it from a table. This has been designed, with its limited print, to be a collectable - not really as a collection as such for the enjoyment on bookshelves.    So, I think, if you are buying it, you really have to think if these strips are going to last the test of time if you are buying this for more than just love of the strip - I have a feeling it will. Some day someone is going to write a philosophical book similar to the Tao of Pooh or Gospels according to the Simpsons about Calvin and Hobbes. To explain it in more detail - not that fans really need that. But C&H are more than just funny faces on a page, their trils and tribulations (as they are) really do reflect our own, and universal western concepts of right and wrong.     I love this collection!
0735201684|5.0|I could not put this enthralling book down! Dr Joseph Murphy has layed out the steps to our personal freedom, and all we have to do is follow his simple instructions, and in using the power of the mind, create a reality that we desire.  <br />I like that Murphy backs up his claims with testimonials and situations that I could easily relate to, and I found it easy to practice the techniques as a result.  <br />Although he doesn't acknowledge them as such, Dr Murphy is employing the simple principles of Quantum Physics and The Observer Principle to illustrate how we can take control and manifest an outcome, and our reality. I did make some significant changes in my life as a result of practising these techniques and principles, and to this day I continue to be the benefactor of those changes! <br /> <br />\\"True and lasting happiness will come into your life the day you get the clear realization that you can overcome any weakness - the day you realize that your subconscious can solve your problems, heal your body, and prosper you beyond your fondest dream\\". <br /> <br />The many real life stories and examples are excellent reading in themselves, and provide great inspiration to tackle some issues for ourself. After reading this little book, and achieving my own success, I realized there is nothing I cannot do by changing my state of mind. <br /> <br />For further inspiration regarding changing our mindset to something greater, I suggest a wonderful DVD that I recently viewed, titled Gather The Women, Keynote Speaker JZ Knight. Another book that fits beautifully with this subject matter is The Creative Process in the Individual by Thomas Troward. For a more thorough understanding, Ramtha's compilation of teachings titled A Beginner's Guide To Creating Reality, offers exciting and expanding reading.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Classic rock is a major quantity today on radio.  Well, if you want to hear the true classic rock then purchase and listen to this grand effort by three of its finest purveyors.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on this effort and now that I have I am overwhelmingly pleased.  Of course these men don't sound the same as they did in their twenties.  No one does. The age factor is forever present. But, they still can play rings around the twenty year olds of today!  And if you haven't guessed yet, CREAM is and will always be my favorite band.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Despite quite a bit of the criticism and dilike for this album, I believe \\"X&Y\\" is one of the best albums of the year. Their album is my most played cd in itunes, and i dont have a problem with any of the songs, they all sound great. My favorties are \\"Talk\\", \\"Square One\\", \\"Fix You\\", and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\". I agree that the next album should have a different twist, but i will appreciate their music no matter what. so far 3 albums produced and 3 times ive loved what ive heard. keep it up guys.
B000A6T262|5.0|In 1966, a TV show writer/producer named Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) had an idea for a futuristic sci-fi TV series in which humanity has united, achieved faster-than-light interstellar space travel and joined other worlds in the \\"United Federation of Planets\\".  The show, known as \\"Star Trek\\", was on the air for a mere three years, but thanks in part to the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing, in syndication the show gained a huge audience and fans began to gather at \\"Star Trek\\" conventions.  With so much interest growing in \\"Star Trek\\", producers at Paramount (which obtained the show from Desilu Productions) considered reviving the TV series in the late 1970's, but opted instead to produce a big-screen feature-length film.   <br /> <br />In 1979, the first film, called \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\", was produced and reunited the entire cast from the cancelled series: Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Lt. Commander/Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard H. 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley, 1920-1999), Lt. Cmdr. Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan, 1920-2005), Lt. Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Lt. Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Keonig), Yeoman Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney) and Doctor (formerly Nurse) Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett, who is Gene Roddenberry's widow).  Directed by the Oscar-award winning director Robert Wise (1914-2005), the film opened to throngs of waiting fans, but sadly, the film's story (inspired by an episode from the original series) was not well received. <br /> <br />Three years later in 1982, the second film entitled \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn\\" opened in theaters.  Based upon an original series episode that guest-starred Ricardo Montalban as the villian Khan Noonien Singh, this film was hailed by fans and remains to this day one of the most popular of all of them.  Though the character of Spock died at the end of this film, the third film released in 1984, \\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\\", sawhis character return because his body at the end of the second film had been left on a newly formed, man-made planet.  The next film released in 1986, \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\", was another very popular film in which the entire original crew travels back in time to current-day Earth in a captured Klingon ship.  Unfortunately, the fifth film released in 1989, \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\", is regarded by many as being the worst \\"Star Trek\\" film ever produced.  Directed by William Shatner, the film's story features Spock's long-lost brother (Laurence Luckinbill) taking over the new Enterprise starship in order to find what he believes is the Garden of Eden, but instead finds an irritated alien entity that had been dumped there by someone else.  The sixth film produced in 1991 and entitled \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\" was the final film starring the entire original cast and featured an interesting story involving the Klingons wanting to create a peace treaty with the Federation. <br /> <br />With so much interest in the franchise again, Paramount decided in 1987 to produce an entirely new \\"Star Trek\\" TV series featuring a new cast, which would form the crew for the latest version of the starship Enterprise set about 100 years after the time of Kirk.  The cast included Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Lieutenant/Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Lieutenant Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby, first season only), Lieutenant Worf (Michael Dorn), Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), Lt. Commander/Commander Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), the android Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), the boy Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) and the frequently recurring character Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg).  The new TV show, named \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\", ran for seven complete seasons between 1987 and 1994. <br /> <br />Four additional big-screen films were then produced starring the cast from\\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\", except for the characters portrayed by Denise Crosby and Wil Wheaton.  The first of these films was released in theaters in 1994 and was entitled \\"Star Trek: Generations\\".  It also included three original cast characters (Captain Kirk, Scotty and Pavel Chekov) to link the \\"Next Generation\\" with the original cast.  Many fans were disappointed with the film, but I enjoyed it.  The second of these \\"Next Generation\\" films was released in 1996.  Entitled \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\", most people enjoyed the excitement of this film's story that featured a deadly cybernetic enemy known as the Borg that had been discovered during the \\"Next Generation\\" series.  Controlled by the powerful Borg Queen (Alice Krige), the Borg travel back Earth's past in order to stop the father of warp drive, Dr. Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell), from testing humanity's first-ever warp-powered ship that allowed Earth to make its first contact with an alien species, the Vulcans. <br /> <br />The third film featuring the \\"Next Generation\\" cast was released in theaters in 1998.  Entitled \\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\", the film was not received as well by fans as the previous film, but was entertaining.  The final film produced to date in 2002, \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" featured an alien species that had yet to be shown in any big-screen film, the Romulans.  Unfortunately, this film's poor performance in theaters was due to a somewhat lackluster story.  Whether or not Paramount will ever produce another film based upon \\"Star Trek\\" is currently unknown, but if another one is produced, it would more than likely feature another completely new cast of characters. <br /> <br />Overall, I rate the complete \\"Star Trek - The Motion Pictures DVD Collection (Special Edition)\\" DVD set with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who has not yet purchased any of the special edition \\"Star Trek\\" films on DVD.  Thank you Gene Roddenberry, wherever you are, for creating such a wonderful universe of characters and stories in \\"Star Trek\\".
068484267X|5.0|I read this when it first came out. I was skeptical at first because it sounded so depressing. But when I got started, I was fascinated by this boy's perspective on life. (The author narrates the book through the eyes of a youngster) This book did bring tears to my eyes from time to time...BUT...it also made me laugh out loud several times too. It's an insightful memior. It shows us that a person's life can be seriously cruel, but that's no reason to not look to the future. Take what life gives you, and turn it into something useful.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash were the best punk band ever, most people will tell you that this disc isnt punk, well i say it it. Music doesnt have to be fast and loud to be punk, it just has to be something different, and thats why i say this disc is punk in spirit, but anyway, i dont really care for punk anymore..the only punk bands i listen to are Rancid, the clash, the sex pistols, and the ramones.<br /> If you respect music, than you should not be without this album,<br />R.I.P Joe Strummer.....
B000AV2G3I|5.0|I bought this CD two days ago and probably have listened to it 5 times already.  This is one of the most exciting compilations from John Lennon yet.  It has something from every album he's done and all the tracks are some of the best.  If you get a JL song in your head and don't have the album, you can bet it's on this one.  If you do have the album, forget it, put this CD on and you have not only one your favorites but plenty more favorites to go with it.  This is a brilliant collection, the best from Lennon so far, and definately a must for all John Lennon fans.  The enclosed booklet has some very good pictures of Lennon as well.  I highly recommend this one to anyone.
B0002OERI0|2.0|This is overrated, but their are some good tracks here. they include:<br /> S.t Jimmy. Hmm, i geuss that's it.<br /><br />P.s: Green day are sellouts, and I have very little respect for them now. But their old music is worth listening to.
0740748475|5.0|If you know Calvin and Hobbes, then I really don't need to tell you anything more than that this set of books is a beautiful and elegant presentation of their world. Just buy it, even if you own all of the paperbacks. You will be thrilled with it. <br /> <br />If you don't know Calvin and Hobbes, then I'll tell you that you are at the threshold of an exquisite experience of life. I am in awe of the world that Watterson has created. On the surface, you are simply reading a highly entertaining comic strip, but as you continue your journey through these books you may find yourself drawn into the amazing and fascinating world of a little boy and his best-friend that is more real, more sincere, more insightful, and more accessible than a mountain of other material claiming to offer such an experience. You will smile. You will laugh - a lot! You will wonder. You might even discover that you love these guys.  <br /> <br />I am extremely grateful to Bill Watterson for introducing Calvin and Hobbes to me. I love them; I hope that you will, too. <br /> <br />
055357342X|5.0|There is so much detail and intrigue in this series that it becomes no small task by this third volume to keep it all straight. And that's for a very good reason, you see - because the story line itself is not straight. Not by a long shot. Even with so much to keep track of, I can't remember a time since I first read the Lord of the Rings that I've had so much fun trying to do so. Each character is well thought out, and the point-of-view storytelling works like a charm - in a very literal sense of the word. Combine \\"hard to put down,\\" with \\"over 1200 pages long,\\" and you get many days worth of spare time eaten up. The Song of Ice and Fire series is, so far, some of the best writing, character or otherwise, that I have ever read. One word of warning to parents: the intended audience is adult here, and the characters that come alive in these pages do and say adult things. It's not smut by any stretch of the imagination, but I would draw the line at mature teenagers in my household.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 were big before this album with unforgettable fire. it was the joshua tree that made them huge. they embarked on their stadium tours and played to mezmerized crowds that almost reached 100,000. how did they do it? they made music that could fill a stadium with pure rock and roll energy. the opening number, where the streets, is a stomper with the big organ intro. and the edge's guitar work rifles through all the songs with his patented echo and reverb sound. larry mullen and adam hold down the fort as a very tight rythm section. and bono's vocals just soar on this album with total conviction. the politics and the commentary gets a little sanctimonious, but the whole package is entertaining and classic enough to forget the details and just go with it.
B00003CXCT|1.0|The edits and all of the \\"Special Edition\\" parts in this movie are garbage.  I ended up getting ripped copies of the LaserDisc version since he refuses to accept money for what I'm willing to pay for.  Good job, Georgie.
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|I have not yet read a review to the genius that not only brought us the amazing and resourceful effects and Book of the Dead artwork for The Evil Dead 1 and 2 and Army of Darkness but created the two Anchor Bay Book of the Dead packages and the interior artwork complete with secret hidden messages. <br />  I just met him at always entertaining Cinema Wasteland in Cleveland and besides being very friendly and approachable he shared that he redrew pages from his new pages that he drew for the Evil Dead 2 Book and were never seen as well as some copies of a couple of the Lost Pages found by Annie and kept in the glass case. <br />  He has again prepared something special for his fans and I just wanted to introduce his contributions on this very cool DVD. <br />  Lets hear it for Tom!
B000683VI4|5.0|I think that \\"The Notebook\\" was definitely a great movie that shows how powerful love is. I really think that the movie was historically accurate in almost every way possible, meaning the clothes, the way teens and adults acted back then, the activities, the separation between the blue-collared group and the white-collared group, and so on. The movie basically portrayed a young couple that came from totally different backgrounds, but didn't care about the materialistic aspects, nor did they care about what others, especially what Rachel McAdam's onscreen parents thought. I believe that Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling, the stars of the movie and the young couple in love, made the movie even more realistic and intriguing because of the chemistry they have with each other onscreen.  It was also really realistic because the movie showed that not everything happens the way people want them to, however in the end things may not be exactly how you want them to be but you have to learn to adjust to what you have. Basically, Rachel McAdams may not have the wealth that her family wish she'd have, but she has the love that she wants and that obviously means more to her than money.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I have to admit this album did not move me as much as gtis Byrjun, and I'm still not sure of (). But we must remember when most of us heard Sigur ros' first major release it was something new to the world entirely. That album was painfully beautiful at least to me only because I could not be apart of the world that seemed to come to life in their music, be it Iceland or something more abstract. Now I am accustomed to that world having (audibly) visited it a number of times and in Takk... it doesn't blow my socks off the way it used to. But it is still an astounding album in it's own right and had I heard Takk... before gtis Byrjun it probably would have had the same effect as the first time I hears Sigur Ros.   And for those who think Sigur Ros is or has been promoted only by pretentious indie music snobs are being nothing short of hypocritical. Some do not understand even simple music can be astoundingly beautiful if done right. And if anyone can make something simple and pure so moving, it is Sigur Ros. And those who want nothing more than the formulaic sound you hear off the radio, may you be blissful in your vapid and numb life.
0689853637|5.0|The creativity that went into this work is undeniable...Sabuda's illustration and pop-ups are not only intricate, but dazzling. A perfect gift-giving book as we approach the holiday season. <br />This work, inspired by Sabuda's journeys through the snowy fields of Michigan as a child is awe-inspiring, and a delight for adults as well as children. Each turn of the page will dazzle you, but the highlight is a surprise pull that comes at the end of the book, and is truly a \\"how did he do that\\" moment. Beautiful nature scenes, incredible snowscapes, and simple yet elegant text.  <br />This is worth buying two of...one to immediately enjoy, and one to tuck away as a gift to a future generation. AWESOME stuff.
B0000039QA|5.0|Christopher Wallace, aka: The Notorious BIG was never a modest man. He lived in the nicest homes following his success, and even bought real diamonds for his eldest daughters' earrings. When this album was being released, Biggie always predicted his own untimely demise; little did the public know, that he would go out this way. Big left us on the 9th of March, 1997; making this album a posthumous follow up to his debut Ready to Die (featuring Big Poppa). Life after Death contains 2 explict language filled cd's. The hits Mo Money Mo Problems (featuring Ma$e, Puff Daddy, and Biggie's wife Faith Evans on the song). Also featured are the genius anthems Hypnotize, Going back to Cali, and the street favorite Notorious Thugs (which contains some of the fastest rapping I've ever laid my ears on, courtest of Bone Thugs and Harmony). The second disk which contains Notorious Thugs, is in my opinion more \\"hardcore\\" than the prior. Extreme drug references are made in this disk, and because of this I warn that children under 16 not purchase this album. I got it when I was 10, and was clueless at some of the language. I mean, in those days us kids didnt go around talking about the things on this album. Nonetheless, its a classic; and is an essential at that. Life After Death would go on to make history, and become the highest grossing gangsta rap album, by selling over 10 million albums and becomming certified Diamond.
B00005JO0J|5.0|i live in the U.K and have just got back from watching and for me this film represents the way big movies should be, big story, big charictors and big explosions. Whedon has hopefully given hollywood a wake up call, I cant believe that what should of been a silly sci-fi film actually made me mist up and laygh in equal mesure an absolute tour deforce i would give it 6 stars if i could, im now going to watch the program cus if its a third as good i will be happy, pluss i hear they may make it into a franchise which would be nice.

B00000J7SS|5.0|This albulm really is a cornerstone for jazz listening.  It is one of three most important albulms along with Birth Of The Cool and Kind Of Blue, by one of the most important Jazz artists.  The reason why Bitches Brew and the other two are so important is that they each signify a major step in Miles' career.  Besides it's importance, the albulm is one of the most emotional and raw alblums I have ever heard.  This albulm is for anybody who likes anything different or wants to have a complete understanding of the history of jazz.
0783225903|2.0|It's interesting how the Amazon reviewers fall into two very opposite camps, those who found this movie boring and those who give it five stars.<br /><br />I like \\"arty\\" films.  Take a look at Aguirre The Wrath of God.  It's wonderful.<br /><br />I have to tell you the simple truth, though.  Brazil was much too long for me, and in some places I was just saying \\"This is stupid\\".  I have to agree with the naysayers on this one.<br /><br />It's not enough to be imaginative and different.  It's not enough to satirize our bureaucratic society.  There are just too many faults here.  The film is all over the place, and not that funny.  It disappointed me.<br /><br />Let me steer you to a far superior comedy that is also highly respected by arty people.  Try \\"Closely Watched Trains\\".  Try \\"Amelie\\".  Try \\"Discreet Charm of the Bourgeouisie\\".  All three are far superior to Brazil.  Check them out.  Try \\"The Lady Eve\\".  It kills this one.
6305841861|5.0|I am with Maddox (The Best Page in The Universe) here: Evil Dead II best movie ever made.<br /><br />This film has it all: laughs, decapitations, monsters, gore, fight sceens, more laughs, and a great off-beat hero with whom anyone with a single molecule of testosterone in their bloodstream will immediately identify with.<br /><br />It also stands up to repeated viewings.<br /><br />This is a timeless classic. If you have never seen it, join our cultus now.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I can say with all honesty that I was expecting X&Y to be a fundamentally groundbreaking rock album. Parachutes and Rush of Blood are two of my all time favorite rock albums; and I really thought that X&Y could have been the best one yet. <br /> <br />Instead I only feel that I bought a mediocre rock album that has been pushed by corporate standards into a weak, watered down version of U2. This isn't to say that I can't stand the album, it's hugely preferable to any other corporate emo crap that you can find released on the major labels. In fact, I really really like Square One and Swallowed In The Sea a lot, and I personally think Speed of Sound is a better song than Clocks, albeit a similar song. But overall the album sounds over produced, dumbed down, and oversimplified. <br /> <br />There is nothing profound about this album, nothing unique, nothing truly moving. I kept waiting for a song with sincere emotional impact throughout my first listen of the album. When What If started, I got my hopes up. Nothing. When Fix You started, I really got my hopes up. By the end of the album, I was so dissatisfied that I just listened to the superb opening track over and over again, because it was the only song I could reconcile myself with at the time. <br /> <br />I won't speculate, as others here have, on why this album is so inferior to Coldplay's previous two. But I can recommend this to fans and newcomers alike- if you are looking for the fundamentally groundbreaking rock album that X&Y isn't, buy Sigur Ros' new album Takk. It is absolutely amazing... it's the most accessible Sigur Ros album yet, and yet it still says very true to the typical artistic creativity the Icelandic group is known for, and I immediately noticed that Takk sounds a little like Rush of Blood. It hasn't received the publicity that X&Y has, but it's worth every penny.
B00005RYLE|1.0|Do not buy this edition.<br /><br />Just don't.<br /><br />Until they put out a full frame of this masterpiece, just boycot it.
0743454537|5.0|All I can say is that this was a page turner.  I read it in about 6 hours.  Picked it up and couldn't put it down, I read through dinner...  We've all heard the saying, \\"There's no such thing as a new story,\\" but Picoult finds a way to make this one very unique.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I have been a Batman fan since I was 7 years old (I'm 48 now). Have been collecting comics of Batman & Superman for over 25 years. I have videos of all the versions of Batman (including the 1940's serials). Believe me, when I saw Batman Begins, I almost screamed at the screen: FINALLY SOMEBODY GOT IT RIGHT!!! Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman was incredible. The only flaw is that Batman should have a real killer instinct. Absolutely no compassion for criminals. The rest of the cast was excellent except in my opinion Katie Holmes. First of all, her character doesn't appear in the comics. Second, she looked way too young for a district attorney. But that's my opinion. Aside from that, the storyline was first rate. You actually believe that this kind of tragedy can happen to anyone. Sometimes it really does. Even though the movie over 2 hours long, to me the time passed way too quickly. I didn't want it to stop. Can't wait for the sequel. I wonder who will play the Joker? When the DVD comes out, you can be sure that I will be the first in line to buy it. If you are a diehard fan, you won't be disappointed.
0316172324|3.0|Having grown with this feeling that my 'first impression' is most of the times the one that counts, I've pushed the '1 click order' button before I could blink an eye (maybe it was the wonderful cover... yes, I know, don't judge a book...). I didn't take any nap while reading it, but I must confess reading sometimes slows down a bit, almost across an umberable point. If I was the editor, I'd do two things: make it 100 page long at the most (98 is a nice number) and I'd reshuffle the text in order to improve the reading speed.
B000066NW0|5.0|I think this album's really great!! I'm a huge Avril fan, and I think Let go rocks!!!

0307276902|5.0|Getting inside Frey's mind from worst to better was a riveting experience.  Of course it may seem like the typical story of rich kid gone rebel but if you pay close enough attention, he was never spoiled and his parents were not shown to be the loving type to him during childhood.  Throughout the story as Frey's brief quips about his parents give insight to his younger life the reader is forced to draw their own conclusion about the source of the addiction.  There was never mentioned any other family member that had such problems however towards the end of the book it is clear what made Frey turn left in his young life.  Obviously if Frey made it out okay to write this book one can conclude that he's doing well now.  The way that the other addicts in the book are portrayed keeps you reading on to find out more and more about them; most of them have their comical moments and all of them have their moments of utter despair.<br /><br />The graphic elements of Frey's addiction make the reading go by quickly.  The writing is colorful (though mostly of blood) and the prose and line breaks make the book an easy page-turner.  Towards the middle the book drags a bit because it's the same scene many times of him going out into the woods to stare at the moon or up at the trees.  Nonetheless Frey grows tremendously but  ends the book making the reader feel uncomfortable about his chance of survival and non-relapse.  The book is a great read and I'd recommend it to anyone.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I don't blame them for going to a bigger label.  I don't blame them for wanting a little success for all that hard work.  I hope they do really well and become a national sensation.  BUT... They were my indie haven, my little known but fiercely loved band, and I'm freaking out to hear \\"Soul Meets Body\\" on a \\"mix\\" radio station at Hitt Street Market.  I think I'm over-reacting - I'm sure I am - but for me, during the past three years since I discovered them (I know you REALLY old DCFC fans are groaning at this), DCFC has been \\"the little band that really could\\" turn out some great music.  And now that they are radio material - I'm used to alternative radio playing them, 96.5 in KC did, but a \\"mix\\" station is just strange - I find I'm wishing they were still my Photo Album/Transatlanticism sweethearts.  I'm not saying that they sold out - Plans really is a fairly typical Death Cab album (though just a little too mellow and a little too emotionally upbeat).  They didn't change their style, and Ben didn't tone down his lyrics, but I know now that the next time I see them live, it's gonna be different - in some big venue with no intimacy and playing only the new songs (please no!  play the old stuff Metallic... uh, um... I mean Death Cab).  We'll see.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I hope I am, but for now, I'm gonna listen to some Transatlanticism magic and try not to think about it.
B000AOJ9X0|4.0|BTW, the recording closest to the \\"real Buddy\\" I think is the track he contributed to the soundtrack to the movie \\"Rush\\".  (Clapton produced the rest of the soundtrack.) <br />It's often overlooked, but superb.
0670033375|1.0|Mr Diamond's most famous book, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is the high religious tome of the ideology of geographic determinism (GD).  This theory states that a culture's dominance on the world stage is almost exclusively a product of geography and plant and animal species available to the local human inhabitants.  As such, it's an extension of every enviro-chicken little encountered over the past 50 or so years - the Ehrlichs et al.  This book is literally just more of the same.<br /><br />Environmentalism as substitute for religion, and the self-loathing of comfortable but scientifically illiterate pseudointellectuals who have willfully and disdainfully disconnected themselves from their civilization's spiritual and philosophical heritage are two of the most ridiculous and most embarrassing symptoms of the disease of postmodernism.  Diamond embodies both of these symptoms.<br /><br />Furthermore, while Diamond frequently and gratingly congratulates himself for \\"exploding racist theories\\" of history every chance he gets, he constantly injects bits of whimsy which can only be attributed to viewing one ethnic group as being inherently superior/inferior to another.  He has said that people in New Guinea are actually more inherently intelligent than Westerners, for example.<br /><br />Much as the predictors (like Ehrlich) of environmental and demographic collapse have been wrong very nearly 100% of the time, so too has the theory of GD been completely discredited in the eyes of science.  There are several books the content of which, at this point, have basically put the theory of GD onto the ash heap of history.  The best and most complete deconstruction of this theory is Hanson's book \\"Carnage and Culture\\".  Hanson very carefully points out that the dominance of one culture cannot be explained by racial differences or diseases or timing of domestication of animals.  In his book, Hanson definitively proves that it is culture and certain cultural values, not geography, or racial differences, or foodstuffs, or disease, which determine the success or failure of one civilization pitted against another.  His book is the antidote for the poison of Diamond's new age hippy-dippy \\"desire masquerading as science\\".<br /><br />The only reason I gave this book any stars at all is that like his other books, Diamond includes lots of little interesting factoids which are fun to learn.  Sadly, they are presented as conclusive proof of his theory, and by any actual scientific metric, they are not.  His books are interesting to read but they never prove his theory in a scientifically valid way.<br /><br />Perhaps these interesting factoids in Diamond's books and and a public education system which has done a very poor job of science education for the past four or five decades, coupled with a political desire in the boomer generation to have touchy-feely environmental policy, explain his books' sales success.y, or racial differences, or foodstuffs, or disease, which determine the success or failure of one civilization pitted against another.

B00005IC2H|5.0|After the 4th of August, Sydney Show...  <br /> <br />I have been thinking to give myself a reason why \\"pretentious\\" shld be fit in to describe sigur ros's music. Well.. if you say Sigur Ros are being pretentious when they were playing Vidrar's piano intro, thousands of people were suddenly all quiet as I can heard the breath of a man who stood just next to me and a couple who stood in front of me were enjoying their intimate moment.. or when people started clapping and shouting before Svegn-G-Englar was started playing.. <br /> <br />Ignoring the impact that Sigur Ros's music have brought to us..  <br /> <br />just go back to listen Oasis's \\"Don't look back in anger\\" or Britney Spears's \\"I Love rock n roll\\"  <br /> <br />Hopefully those music will inspire you and started thinking how to use the word \\"pretentious\\" properly without abusing it.

B00003CX9W|5.0|The newest processes of the day may be called ancient by today's standards, but the significance of Fantasia lies in its greatness.  It is a high-quality artwork and cinematic experience worthy of the greatest auteurs.  However, not all of Disney's works were in the realm of greatness.  Combining sureal graphic imagery to pre-existing classical music proved an entirely new idea of comment.  Such significance is important  to the progression of cinema, it is a landmark of cinema history.  Fantasia develops its work for its cinematic comment.  It is as every bit brilliant as the composers and their great works.  Fantasia was something totally new and exciting for the cinema, but, in quality, remains today as a significant statement within cinema as a form of art.  Comprehension of Fantasia's essence lies in true love to the subjective form.<br /><br />However, the Disney company has an obligation to Fantasia.  I believe the company demeans that obligation when it alters scenes from the movie.  I'm talking about the Beethoven segment.  The older VHS deleted a few notes of the Beethoven music when the company omitted some of the \\"racial\\" frames, and now this new DVD computer-colorizes one of the black animals to a different color.  I don't know why they'd do this, except to possibly protect their image.  Why does black worry them?  \\"Birth Of a Nation\\" is an extremely racially bigoted movie, yet still brilliant cinema.  But, the producers of that film aren't executive producers and property and trademark copyright owners that have to protect their image.  Although I think this DVD is a fine DVD except for the alterations that anger me, why has the company always been ready to \\"tinker around\\" with the man's (Disney's) original works?  The company makes a lot of money by selling, in essence, toys for children.  Obviously, they refuse to stand behind Disney's original works when those works might upset people.  Just because Mickey Mouse is in it doesn't mean the company is being honest with the public.nest with the public.

If you buy the cd, listen to BILLY, this is a very nice song, gives you a very nice feeling. <br />See ya friends.
B000AV2G3I|1.0|I'm a big Beatles/Lennon fan but come on, not another best of. I can't believe with all the material Lennon recorded, there is not any new songs. I guess Harrison is the next one to have different best of albums released every other year.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|And I say that statement with some pain. It really hurts me to give a Deftones release less than 5 stars, but their newest collection of B-Sides and Rarities is just one of those releases that had so much potential, and in my mind fell short of what the goal was. Not that there is much about the release that is bad, indeed this is a fine collection of songs if you are any kind of Deftones fan, but it's definitely lacking as to what it could have been. A lot of key songs are missing, and the pace/mode of the cd seems to be more centered on slower, moodier pieces, and lacking the balance that most Deftones releases seem to have. It's just one of those instances when your hopes are extremely high, and in the end you wind up getting dissapointed.    To begin the song selection seems odd to me. It's not that any of the songs are bad, just most are stuff we've already heard, or are just different versions of old songs. The \\"Digital Bath\\", \\"Change In The House of Flies\\" and \\"Be Quiet And Drive\\" acoustics, while good, have been heard by most fans. The \\"Teenager\\" remix isn't really that special or different from the original. Most of the good songs featured on here are cover songs. \\"Simple Man\\" and \\"No Ordinary Love\\" are Leonard Skynard covers. \\"The Chauffer\\" is an excellent Duran Duran cover. While we do get some cover songs, we get a couple of originals in \\"Crenshaw\\" and \\"Black Moon\\", however neither compares to the rarities that weren't placed on here. Which is why after listening to the cd, I'm still left with the question, \\"Where's the stuff we wanted to hear?\\" Foolishly left off the cd is \\"Teething\\", perhaps one of the best Deftones songs around (which appeared on the Crow City of Angels Soundtrack). \\"I Can Barely Breathe\\" (Escape from LA soundtrack) was also left off. I don't really understand the choice behind this because I guarantee most fans don't own those soundtracks, and this would have been a great place to put them. Songs which are mysteriously absent from the cd are :    \\"Teething\\" (The Crow: City of Angels Soundtrack)  \\"I Can Barely Breathe\\" (Escape From LA Soundtrack)  \\"Lovers\\" (B-side from Self Titled, appeared on \\"Hexagram\\" import)  \\"Boys Republic\\" (Only on the special edition of \\"White Pony\\")  \\"To Have And To Hold\\" (Depeche Mode Cover, amazing)  \\"South Of Heaven\\" (Slayer cover, also amazing)  \\"Venison\\" (Original Deftones demo song, really good and is floating around on the net)    The DVD portion though thankfully saves the cd from total failure. We finally get all the Deftones Videos in one place (although I'm still forced to ask, where's the video for \\"Teething\\"?). It's nice if you haven't seen any of them, and there's also a never before seen video of \\"Root\\" on here. Coming along with the videos is some live and behind the scenes footage as well, which is well worth the purchase of the cd since there hasn't been a decent Deftones DVD released yet. The booklet that comes with the cd is also very cool, mainly because it's a 24 page piece of history which includes linear notes from the band. Pretty neat if you don't know much about them. Another thing I like about the cd is that they went back to the cd design pattern featured on \\"Adrenaline\\" and \\"Around The Fur\\", which makes it feel like old times. Hey that can make all the difference.    Overall the cd is a good buy if you're a hardcore Deftones fan, but it's definitely lacking like mentioned in previous reviews. I find most of the songs on here to be moody, atmospheric pieces. There's not a lot of heavy ones which is kind of dissapointing. That's why I feel this cd could have benefitted from adding songs like \\"Teething.\\" Overall though I can't complain much about the cd. It's still great Deftones music, and a great opportunity to hear a lot of rare tracks if you haven't run across them before on an import or the interent or something. I'd say this is only essential to the most dedicated Deftones fans. If you're a casual fan, I don't see this cd offering you much, and that is a good reason to skip it. Still I guess this will hold me over until the Deftones unleash their next studio effort on us.
B000002I6V|4.0|Graham Nash has had an uneven track record for song writing, for solo work, and for his collaborations.  This recording is obviously done by a passionate young man and includes many outstanding tunes, especially the simpler songs.  But sometimes it sounds a little pretentious and a product of its era.  It's fun yet dated.  As a contrast, \\"Wild Tales\\" is Nash at his best.
B0000024K1|5.0|Ok first things first, Vincent Vega you don't know what bass is? Its the frequency of the music that makes your walls vibrate. Don't be hatin' on a classic 'cos you don't understand politics. <br />Anywyas, back to the album itself. Chuck D, however much some of you may not like it, tells it how it is when it comes to the government. Flava's kinda annoying sometimes...For all you out there who think this album is racist whats wrong with you? I think it's safe to say it contains no racism what so ever. (The following isn't intended to sound racist) I can't remember this particular users name, but he/she said they were white, & they hated rap before this album (props to them for gettin into QUALITY rap, not that 50 cent garbage, 50 might aswell be five-o) and if they're white, a like this album becuase of it's lyrics, i don't see how you can tell people it's racist. Ok, maybe you don't like Public Enemy, so go home son, your probably too young for politics, don't understand. I don't claim to be old & mature, i'm 15, i'm not ashamed of that, however i find it sad that there is some of you out there hating on this album purely for its political content & supposed racism. <br /> <br />I recommend this album to any true rap fan, but also to anyone looking to get into meaningful rap, not commercial trash. <br /> <br />
B000002GQJ|4.0|This was one of those albums (when albums dominated our musical awareness) that deeply moved many of us back when we were kids.  It still has some magical tunes and some sound a little dated nowadays.  If you want something by the Moody Blues that's not as heavily orchestrated as their other albums yet still has their signature sound, this is their best.

B00000AFGM|4.0|The fall of 1998 saw the release of Marilyn Manson's third studio album \\"Mechanical Animals.\\" The follow-up to \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" (1996), and proceeded by \\"Holywood\\" (2000), \\"Mechanical Animals\\" is the second album in Manson's grand industrial Goth-opera.<br /><br />Although it debuted at number one on the charts and quickly went platinum, it was something of a commercial disappointment. Unfortunately, rather than gain fans and expand their fan base with the new release, Marilyn Manson lost ground.  And while \\"Mechanical Animals\\" didn't torpedo the band's career, (i.e. \\"Van Halen 3,\\" released the same year) it did throw a wrench in the band's momentum.<br /><br />Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor had been instrumental in the band's success and sound. Reznor had produced Manson's debut, \\"Portrait of an American Family\\" (1994) and the classic \\"Antichrist Superstar.\\"<br /><br />Wanting to get out of Reznor's shadow and not wanting to remake \\"Antichrist Superstar,\\" Manson went for a new look and sound. With \\"Mechanical Animals,\\" Manson chose to eschew a Goth-metal image in favor of a Bowie-like glam one. Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins) and former Soundgarden producer Michael Beinhorn helped Manson in achieving his artistic vision. The cover of the album is indicative of its sound-clean, white, bright, and crisp.<br /><br />Some have commented that \\"Mechanical Animals\\" isn't as \\"dark\\" as \\"Antichrist Superstar.\\" I don't feel this is entirely accurate. While \\"Mechanical Animals\\" is certainly popier and more polished, it deals exclusively with dark themes.<br /><br />The general theme of the album is a sci-fi epic, sometime in the not-so distant future. It describes a world of dehumanization and indifference.  Narcissism, nihilism, and complacency are the prevailing ideas. It tells of a world in which people are doped into submission. Manson's (then) girlfriend Rose McGowan proved some inspiration as heartbreak and broken relationships was also an underlining theme. For his sci-fi concept album, Manson created the androgynous character \\"Omega\\" and his band of \\"Mechanical Animals.\\" The title \\"Mechanical Animals\\" can also be seen as an analogy to human beings in this sci-fi world-mechanical and heartless.<br /><br />Manson didn't completely abandon their sound on this new disc. They still sounded like Marilyn Manson, but the new sound was distinctly popier, glossier, and more polished. The industrial-metal was at times tinged with disco-like beats and female backup singers. The sound was noticeably cleaner, which I believe some to mistake for being lighter.<br /><br />Although guitarist Zim Zum had left the group prior to the album's release, he played on a majority of the album. The band is rounded out by longtime Manson collaborator and bassist Twiggy Ramirez, Ginger Fish (drums), and M.W. Gacy (keyboards).<br /><br />From the beginning chords of \\"Great Big White World\\" the tone is set for the album. This mid-tempo number stands in sharp contrast to \\"Superstar's\\" opener \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem.\\" The title of the song is self-explanatory of its theme. It's one of the album's strongest tracks and makes for a good opener.<br /><br />The album's big hit \\"The Dope Show\\" can be best described as \\"industrial disco-metal.\\"<br /><br />The album's infectious title track \\"Mechanical Animals,\\" show's Manson's more melodic side.<br /><br />\\"Rock is Dead\\" is one of the more rocking and straight-forward songs on the album.<br /><br />The album slows down for the next few songs. \\"Dissasssociative\\" is a beautifully morose plea which tells of wanting to be set free from this hellish world. The almost psychedelic \\"The Speed of Pain\\" sounds (as others have commented) akin to Pink Floyd.<br /><br /> The pace picks up a bit with the frantic \\"posthuman,\\" which if reworked slightly, could have been used for \\"Superstar.\\"<br /><br /> The hurried \\"I Want to Disappear\\" is a bratty, nihilistic submission into indifference.<br /><br />\\"I don't like the drugs (but the drugs like me)\\" is both a highlight and low point for the album. This funky disco-tinged rocker is quite catchy-but the lyrics are a little clich&eacute;d. It's as though Manson were trying a little too hard on this one to be controversial, but was also too lazy to think up something more original. Still, the lyrics in the verse are quite clever and it's a good song none-the-less.<br /><br />The hard-hitting \\"New Model No.15,\\" has a lot of bite and although not a hit, is one of the album's strongest songs.<br /><br />The mid-tempo \\"User Friendly\\" describes the self-centeredness and lack of caring or consideration in a relationship. This could have been used as a single, as it is one of the catchiest songs on the album.<br /><br />\\"Fundamentally Loathsome\\" boarders on sounding like cabaret. Indeed, it sounds a bit like something The Dresden Dolls would pen.<br /><br />\\"The Last Day on Earth\\" is probably the closet Manson will approach to composing a love song. It's probably my personal favorite on the album. It has a cool sci-fi introduction and tones, and is thoroughly infectious.<br /><br />\\"Coma White\\" is the perfect way to conclude the album. This downbeat number is this album's \\"Man That You Fear,\\" which was the closing epic on the \\"Superstar\\" album. \\"Coma White\\" wraps up the album hopeless and concluding that numbness through medication is what will be our fate.<br /><br />While \\"Mechanical Animals\\" is an excellent album and a worthy follow-up to \\"Superstar,\\" it will probably always be in the shadow of its predecessor. Some of Manson's fans were just unwilling to accept the new look and sound of the band.<br /><br />Non-music related factors are also in play for \\"Mechanical Animals\\" taking the backseat to \\"Superstar.\\" In 1996, Manson was a lighting rod for social critics and a daily subject on any TV talk show. In 1996 concerned parents and fanatical, right-wing, bible-thumping evangelicals were all up in arms over Manson, and \\"Superstar\\" serves as a token of that era. By the time \\"Mechanical Animals\\" was released, some of the frenzy had died down.<br /><br />All of this is unfortunate because while \\"Mechanical Animals\\" isn't quite the masterpiece that \\"Superstar\\" is, it's still a great album and a worthy successor. Manson should be applauded for his willingness to reinvent himself and take some creative and artistic risks. It would have been a lot safer and easier for him to have just made another \\"Superstar.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, although not fully appreciated upon its release, \\"Mechanical Animals\\" is a superb album that has stood the test of time. Hopefully, future generations will discover this lost gem and fans that rejected it the first time around will come back and give it another listen.sco-tinged rocker is quite catchy-but the lyrics are a little clichd.

B00007GZQZ|5.0|Although this movie was pretty much universally panned, it remains one of my favorite comedies. It doesn't get the credit it deserves for the slapstick scenes where the house literally crumbles around Tom Hanks. Everyone I know that has seen this movie has lost it completely when the stairs come down. Not to mention the constant sarcasm of Tom Hanks' character. His reply to his real estate agent's question of \\"Can you get $250,000 by close of business Friday?\\" is met with the answer \\"Well, let me see, if I sell everything I own I might be able to buy you lunch.\\", for example. That is just one of many great lines delivered, including the one above from Shelley Long. This movie always cracks me up and is great for anyone who has ever hit their hand with a hammer by accident.
0740748475|5.0|I am writing this on my birthday, having received this as a gift just yesterday.  I can't think of a better gift for one's birthday!  I have been a fan of Calvin and Hobbes for a very long time - indeed, I have given a lecture that drew upon images and actions of Calvin and Hobbes along with commentary based on their theological/philosophical counterparts.  If you think about it, there is a good deal of Calvinist thinking in Calvin, and a good deal of Hobbesian philosophy in Hobbes.  But that is, blessedly for most, not the main idea of the books here.<br /><br />This beautifully produced three-volume set is the complete collection of Calvin and Hobbes cartoon strips from the newspapers over the decade that Bill Watterson produced them.  I have several paperback editions of these strips, but it invariably happens that a strip I remember is not among the ones I have.  For example, for the longest time I searched for the one in which Calvin expresses his difficulty with mathematics, and Hobbes explains that this is nothing - wait until he reaches imaginary numbers (like eleventeen, thirty-twelve, and other such, which tigers of course have a natural instinct for).  It might take some thumbing through to find things, but then, who would mind going through this glorious collection?<br /><br />All of the characters are here - Calvin and Hobbes, and all the long-suffering around them: the teacher Miss Wormwood, Susie, Rosalyn the babysitter, and Calvin's parents (who are not mentioned by name in the strip).  There are also the bit players (imaginary or not imaginary) characters such as aliens, the doctor, the principal, Moe, dinosaurs, and more.  We re-learn the rules to Calvinball, and re-enter the club G.R.O.S.S.  (which is an acronym that stands for Get Rid Of Slimy girlS).<br /><br />There are three books, each about 500 pages each.  It includes a good introduction with autobiographical information about Bill Watterson, who is known to be a reclusive figure, shying away from the limelight and avoiding marketing opportunities that might have made much more money (those images of Calvin on the various trucks and cars, seen in rather mischievous situations, are actually not authorized by Watterson).  Watterson recounts part of his struggle to contain the world of Calvin and Hobbes into such a short space.  He also discusses the difficulty and irony of dealing with characters that are very much a part of the culture they are at the same time critiquing.  The strips are a bit smaller than might wish, but in order to keep all things in one collection (without going to another large volume, and adding to the already 20+ pounds of this one) I think the decision was a good one to go with the size here.<br /><br />This makes a fabulous gift, for oneself and for friends.  Calvin and Hobbes live forever in the world of imagination.  Go explore.and avoiding marketing opportunities that might have made much more money (those images of Calvin on the various trucks and cars, seen in rather mischievous situations, are actually not authorized by Watterson).

The strips are a bit smaller than might wish, but in order to keep all things in one collection (without going to another large volume, and adding to the already 20+ pounds of this one) I think the decision was a good one to go with the size here.    This makes a fabulous gift, for oneself and for friends.  Calvin and Hobbes live forever in the world of imagination.  Go explore.
B0002OERI0|5.0|<br /> <br />Green Day is one of my favorite bands.  They usually have what I am looking for when I want to listen to music.  This CD is one of their best.  Not only does this CD have great melodies it also has great lyrics as well.   <br /> <br />In the past they were very good. Then something happened and I lost interest in the band. Lately they have been getting better and better.  And with this new CD they have won me back. Hopefully they will continue to make amazing music as they are now and not take any steps backward. <br /> <br />I suggest this CD to all people who enjoy music, and want to hear some more.   <br />
B000B0WODA|4.0|This follow-up to their amazing debut brings us the same Franz Ferdinand that we love to dance to..but adds a bit more \\"rock\\" into the formula.  It starts off strong and doesnt let go...but its the last two songs that take a different spin from the norm and end up standing out from the rest.  Great CD...definitely take advantage of the package deal with this and the new Fiona Apple CD...both are two of this year's most entertaining albums.

B00009V7T2|5.0|I started backwards...like many folks, purchasing Frances The Mute shortly after it came out.  And that album knocked me on my arse, no doubt.  But, I had been hesitant to hear Deloused in the Comatorium, because I was afraid it may not live to the standard set on Frances.  Thank God I was wrong.  In fact...I feel this album is just slightly better.  It starts off very low key before hitting you like a brick wall and the high-pitched \\"Now I'm Lost!\\" and it never lets go.  This album was produced by Rick Rubin, and his presence is certainly felt.  The songs reamin straight out of left field, but they're catchy and you're never bored.  One of the gripes I had with Frances and with Deloused is the band's incessant need for noodling around during the songs (apparently giving it the \\"live\\" feel).  You can definitely feel it in the middle section of \\"Cicatriz ESP.\\"  The \\"meat\\" of these incredibly construted songs seem to be forgotten when your listenting to 5 minutes of sound efects. Thankfully, Rubin doesn't allow too much time for this and its really that particular song that it seems a bit too much.  In Frances however, the absense of another producer is almost too grating.  I noticed a lot of old-school Santana in this album, especially in the frantic \\"Drunkenship of Lanterns\\" and the end of \\"Cicatriz ESP.\\" \\"Eriatarka\\" and \\"Televators\\" are the most easy to swallow and the most \\"structured,\\" the former reminds of Tool a bit, especially in the chorus. The real stand-out track on this slbum though is its closer \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt.\\"  About halfway through the song makes a complete 180 with a frantic guitar solo on crack, then it changes again to a smooth scid jazz guitar solo, before coming back to the main melody and slamming us with the most dramatic ending you could have thought of.  All in all, aside from the extraneous noise every so often, this album is a rock masterpiece.  Let's hope TMV bring Rick Rubin back in for their next album, and bring out the bestof their first 2 albums...but for the love of all thats holy...kepp the music tight...no more 10 minute periods of sound effects please.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|As a serious fan of this movie I am completely pissed off at Walter Hill chose to put his comic book interpretation in this movie, without also adding the original verision so people can at least see the version that was released in the theatres at the time.  And in the featurette according to the principals connected with making this movie,the opening scene with Cleon talking to his girlfriend before going up to the Bronx,(usually shown on the cable versions of this film),this was left out since they thought that this scene was unnecessary since most of the movie takes place at night.  How stupid is that when we have a daylight scene at the end of the movie?  It would add value to the scene that starts of with Cleon talking about them going to the Bronx in the beginning.  And what the hell (?), how to you cut the part when Ajax, sees the Baseball Furies for the first time, go to another scene of Cleon, Vermin and Rembrandt getting on a different train, and then go back to the station shot with Ajax, Swan, Snow and Cowboy seeing the Furies?  WHAT THE HELL????  Thank god I kept the original DVD!  The only thing good on this DVD is the featurettes.  And while we are at it, why must you go through 8 previews before you can even skip to the damm movie????  And let's not even talk about the ending of the movie a freeze framed comic strip!??!!!!!  OMG!!! It's terrible!<br /><br />I like the fact that the movie is clearer, and the sound is fantastic. And I also realize that this is the director's cut.  But if these artists and directors cannot realize that when you have a audience that loves your original movie to the point that it is a cult classic, and you don't even acknowledge it - DAMM!!! Thanks for showing some love to your fans!<br /><br />I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
0895260131|5.0|A must read for anyone interested in the truth about the enemy we face.  This book dispells the accepted theory of Islamic Fanaticism <br />and shows that based on the history of the religion, the so-called  <br />\\"Fanatics\\", are according to their own Koran,  anything but a <br />minority of the faith. <br /> <br />Read this book.
B000AARKOO|5.0|O.K., I'll admit it. I am a history buff. So when I saw the trailers for this movie set during the crusades I just had to see it.  I was greatly suprised (and impressed) to see just how well the movie was able to weave actual events into the fabric of the story (unlike say last years \\"King Arthur\\").  The characters portayed are also (for the most part) based on real people.  During the coarse of the story we meet a range of characters, some of them are the \\"good guys\\" and some are  not.  However we find out that even some of these \\"good guys\\" are not above underhanded tactics to achieve their goals.  Between these two groups we have Balian our hero and his incoruptable sense of honor (I had strong identification with this character).  I understand at sometime in the future there will be a \\"directors cut\\" and I'm sure I will be interested in it,but for the time being I can't wait!

B00000I41J|5.0|Fantastic combo, , just great. The new mix is not quite as good as I thought it would be. Not enough bass ...
B0006GAI6O|1.0|I highly recommend the Japanese original, it's a beautiful, wonderful film.  Where did the American remake go so wrong?  Well a primary, basic, underlying premise to the original was the fact that public displays of affection, the dreaded PDAs, are not normative in Japan.  Ballroom dancing is a deviant behavior there, so I don't know how they thought they were going to translate, or I think maybe that would be transliterate this very interesting plot into the U.S. Midwest.  Well, they didn't even really try.  Then, they made some strange casting decisions for the stars, they needed an actor with more depth for the leading man role, and more of a Ginger (as in Fred and Ginger) for the dance instructor part.  Not that J-Lo can't dance, but she didn't get this style right.  You might notice the polemic, bi-modal reviews here, if you love Gere or J-Lo unconditionally, or if you just started taking ballroom dance lessons, you might like this remake.  If you're looking for a good movie, get the original.  The soundtrack, however, is very good, you might want to consider getting that to listen to after you watch the original movie.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Like many 30-year-olds, I have virtually stopped purchasing CDs. Back around 2001 I downloaded every song I could possibly want, and then stopped, fearing legal action. 2001 is the last time I purchased a CD (Disturbed), saying over and over again I would never buy another one. That was true, until today. Because I don't download anymore, and listen to satellite radio constantly, I am up on new music but have no way of getting the music myself. \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" hit me HARD! I HATED it the first time I saw the video for it on FUSE. Then I began hearing it on DirecTV \\"Alternative\\" channel and just absolutely could not get enough of it. Today, I went to Best Buy and bought the CD, my first in almost five years. As I write this, I have listened to the CD through twice, and am about to \\"spin it\\" again.  <br /> <br />THIS is why I stay at the cutting edge of music. Gorillaz defies classification, just like originators always do. There are so many influences and styles distributed throughout this album that I am not going to even try to list them. The sense I get after listening, if we must compare, is Pink Floyd. But although many of the \\"musical journeys\\" taken on Demon Days give the same Floydian sense of \\"feeling\\" music, Gorillaz' music is purely their own. I concur that \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" and \\"Dare\\" are the best tracks, but the remainder are not fillers, just the ebb and flow of the album. Someday, Demon Days will MATTER, my friends! Excuse me, now, while I purchase Gorillaz first album from AMAZON.com! <br /> <br />
0740748475|5.0|I recall, some years ago, a text discussing Creationism vs. Evolution, which, perhaps not surprisingly, used Calvin & Hobbes -- y'know, the kid and his tiger, not the other two who masqueraded in flesh with those names [what did *they* ever do that was important? ;)] -- to example *both* sides of the issue.  I thought that stepped along line few were willing, or able, to edge-walk.  The philosophy and genius of Bill Watterson was that, and so very much more.<br /><br />Seeing the eyes through a mischievous child's eyes, without the pedantic nor moralistic tone which has been enshrouded around so many \\"adults\\" revisiting childhood in prose and/or art, Watterson captured perfectly what it is to be n over-imaginative kid in a world that isn't geared for such minds.  Through phantasic daydreams of outer space adventures, or dinosaur-era rampages, Calvin ventured far and distant vistas of elaborate construction; all as a means to avoid the mundane systems imposed upon him through learning a series of dates and places and calling it history -- or the basics of mathematic number systems.  Calvin drags his best friend, Hobbes (a tiger who pretends to be a stuffed animal when anyone else is around), into grandiose journeys involving time travel, treasure-hunting, and racing downhill in a wagon or sled -- all the while discussing the merits and validity of pre-determinination.  His mother tries not to kill him when he wakes her at 2am to ask if love is just a series of chemical impulses or something deeper and more spiritual.  Nor can she understand why she finds a bowl of luke-warm tapioca pudding in the middle of the floor in front of the television (set there, of course, as an offering to a modern deity who turns our brains into such ilk as luke-warm tapioca).<br /><br />Through-out all of his adventures, this tiger and his human friend teach us about, not about life necessarily, but about the lens through which we view the paradox of our beauty and inadequacies in which we all live.  And they do it with made-up games with ever-changing rules, poems of incredible complexity and profoundly simple subject matter...<br /><br />\\"Like delicate lace<br /><br />  So the threads intertwine,<br /><br /> Oh, gossamer web<br /><br />  Of wond'rous design!<br /><br /> Such beauty and grace<br /><br />  Wild nature produces...<br /><br /> Ughh, look at the spider<br /><br />  Suck out the bug's juices!\\"<br /><br />...or by turning a cardboard box into a \\"transmogrifier\\" device.  Their dancing and singing philosophy spans the range of emotion and illuminates the everyday surroundings with light and humor to remind us of what is really important.  In such a manner, as perhaps only Antoine de Saint Exup&eacute;ry has done with \\"The Little Prince\\".<br /><br />Now, as for this fine collection:  Everything is in here.  Each incredible comic in the entire run of the series.  All gorgeously rendered and bound in three volumes that as heavy as anything John Calvin and Thomas Hobbes published.  Someone (I think it might have been G. K. Chesterton) once wrote that fine literature should, in hardcover form, be heavy enough to knock out a bugler.  By that definition, this could well be the finest literature on a library shelf.  By defining literature as something provoking thought and discussion of our world and the life in it, Calvin & Hobbes does that as well.  Such a collection is likely to make other works on your bookcase envious, be they by Rumi or Hemingway, Sun Tzu or Gaiman, Milton or Hawkins.  Fine other books in history have given such deep and vast views of philosophy and religion, disguised as a comic strip that can make you laugh with tearful joy.ch we all live.

0553208845|3.0|Like other readers on this forum, I was introduced to this classic piece of literature in High School.  25-years ago, it felt deeply profound and infinitely resonant.  But now, with the benefit of having lived a good portion of my life, I see how in many respects, Hesse has presented the young reader with a skimming of philosophical brilliance.  While many elements and themes are insightful and quite applicable to most, the overall concept is flawed and unsatisfying.  If life is unchanging, then why struggle at anything?  Why not simply \\"exist\\" as a mediocre and meaningless oxygen consuming meat-blob?  The reason is that life and things do change, and we can each have profound and meaningful influence on the way that things can be changed.  Perhaps the missing chapter of this book is the part where Siddhartha decides to do everything reasonable in his power to leave the planet and his fellow creatures \\"better off\\" as a result of his time as a living being?  That's my belief, after harvesting a good portion of adult living after Siddhartha's inspiration to me as a young man.
B00068NVI4|5.0|In what was indisputably their heyday and the golden age of progressive rock, the 1970s, YES set the standard for composition, musicianmanship, pure spirituality and ecstatic emotion to which lesser mortals --even other great bands like ELP, Genesis and the Floyd-- could only dream of aspiring. I saw them three times back then (on tours following the releases of Close to the Edge, Relayer and Going for the One) and found them --incredibly-- to be even better live than in the studio. Then, in the eighties, tragically, they caught a fatal dose of the Buggles and turned pathetically frivolous and blandly commercial (i.e. they completely lost the plot). I, like countless YES fans of the definitive period, gave up on them altogether. Since then, I've viewed any new product bearing the traditional or redesigned YES logo with extreme caution, but treasured those classic albums as true gems --the lofty pinnacles of progressive rock. Imagine my unadulterated joy, when, having dared to purchase this anniversary DVD, and upon pressing the play button with a sense of trepidation, I discover that, as if by some miracle of reincarnation, the 'classic line-up' is reunited and making old and new music as if that desperate interim period were just a bad dream. They've rediscovered themselves and the confidence in what they originally stood for - they've entered their second youth. No other progressive band that peaked in the 70s and then faded into mediocrity (and there were so many of them) can match the brilliance of this comeback. A moving performance, captured with reverence, that had me leaping about the room in sheer, blissful abandon as if I were still the long-haired, fur-coated, patchouli-reeking, adolescent YES fan that I once was (not the greying, middle-aged, father of two that I now am!). Paradise regained! If God had a houseband, this is (approximately) how it would sound. There's only one answer to life: and it's YES! Thanks, lads, for restoring my faith. (And dear reader: ignore the pathetic whinging of those other reviewers who need to get a life.)ader: ignore the pathetic whinging of those other reviewers who need to get a life.)
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Hey Girl is my favorite song on this album full of good songs.
B000AYEIZY|1.0|The lads really sound like it was past their bedtime.  They sure put me to sleep.  Just going through the motions for the dough I guess.  Clapton's Stratocaster comes up short.  It just doesn't have that tone.  Maybe the drugs they were taking back in the sixties were better.  Overall, a major disappointment.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|Scan down and read the review that starts with emailing Paramount.  That one is the most accurate.  This film is embarrassing to watch.  The script makes \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" look like \\" All About Eve.\\" DeCaprio is doomed to disaster in his performance mainly because of the horrid writing. Winslet fares no better.  They are both fine actors but in an impossible situation here.   This tragic event that took place in 1912 deserved better treatment.  The success of the film clearly demonstrates the mentalitiy of the supporters of the movies today; empty headed morans!  Compare this film with the \\"Titanic\\" of 1951 starring Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb, the days of great actors and intelligent script writing.  Also, the even more superior \\"A Night to Remember\\" is much more satisfying than this piece of JUNK! PS.  And to add insult to injury it tied with \\"Ben-Hur in the record number of Oscars.  It was alot more difficult to win 11 academy awards in 1959.  There were much fewer categories.
B000002AZ8|3.0|if vitalogy is one of the most unfocused and inconsistent music albums, it also contains a lot of the band's best work. <br />\\"Last Exit\\" is probably my favorite Pearl Jam rocker. It is so in your face and the repetetive 5/4 riffs aboslutely kill. It gets me going every time I put the album on and Eddie is at his most fierceful. Great stuff. <br />\\"Spin the Black Circle\\": another punk number. A bit too fast for me. Kinda like \\"Vs\\"'s Blood\\" but maybe less wilder and less \\"all over the place\\".  <br />\\"Not For You\\": love this track. Very funky. Great guitar sol. Love it when it slows down and picks up again. Very unique to Pearl Jam's catalogue. I love it when Eddie screms \\"this is not for you\\". I find it very anthemic. <br />\\"Tremor Christ\\"; a different genre. It's ok I guess but It sort of leaves me neither hot nor cold... <br />\\"Nothingman\\": too slow, too boring. Eddie sings well but the melody is somewhat bland. <br />\\"The Whipping\\" : another \\"neither hot nor cold\\" track, but it rocks sufficiently. <br />\\"Pry,to\\": it's an interlude. Nothing more. <br />\\"Corduroy\\": Now we,'re talking. This song on its own is worth the whole album. One of the best PJ songs ever. Rebellious, angry, and very emotional.  Great intro, great chorus, great riff, great chords. Powerful stuff. Again I love the moment at the end of the song when it softens and pick up again. Much better than any song on \\"Vs\\" apart from maybe \\"Dissident\\". Why didn't they put the lyrics in the booklet, dammit? It took me a while to work out what it was about. <br />\\"Bugs\\"; fun experimental piece. Nothing more to it <br />\\"Satan's Bed\\": sounds like an average Punk band going funky. Interesting. <br />\\"Better Man\\": too anthemic! Good beginning but the chorus along with the organs is too sappy, and I just find that the way PJ play on this album is not very gutsy...but of course, it remains a classic for most listeners. <br />\\"Aye Davanita\\": Is this Pearl Jam? Damn! For a while I thought I was listening to Karaokemusic. <br />\\"Immortality\\": a gem! a gem! Can;t go wrong with PJ songs starting with \\"i\\" : indifference\\" \\"insignficance\\". It's all goood. But this one is a wonder. GREAT GREAT guitar work. Great compo. Great singing. The whole instrumentation blends in perfectly. It's a great closer. <br />\\"Stupid mop\\": no, sorry. It's not a song. It should have been a hidden track and only went for at most 2 minutes, not 6. This stuff belongs to Sonic Youth. They're good at that. You're obviously not. Let them do the work. <br />      <br />Verdict: duds versus gems. Gems are hypergems, but duds are too abundant in this album. Very sad result! Conclusion: Vitalogy scores over ok. 3.5 <br />Not a bad score, considering!
B00005JNQA|1.0|This is the worst film I saw in the past 10 years[and I watch about 7 per week].What a waste of time.
B000002BFZ|4.0|One of the least accessible albums of Pearl Jam, No Code remains nevertheless a solid stance in the Pearl Jam catalogue.  Some songs are not so good, with Eddie yelling his voice over purposeless riffs (Lukin, Habit) or the band not going anywhere with their music (Smile). Some songs are self indulgent such as Who You Are, Present Tense, and I m Open but No Code is definitely worth a listen just to get a taste of the further inside of the band, for it sounds like a live rehersal in a studio. The opener \\"Sometimes\\" is great and the softly hummed \\"Off He Goes\\" is one of the most wonderful songs done by Eddie Vedder.   In other places, experimenting leads the band to new interesting results (In My Tree is actually a very deep piece of musical arrangements when you get into it), varied vocals (Mankind) or good but little overdone touches of country (Smile, Red Mosquito and Around The Bend).  For Pearl Jam fans, this album is not a return to form. After the challenging Vitalogy, No Code continues that unexpected direction which suprised many listeners, showing that the band is gaining confidence with its natural self.   For new listeners, this record could be a revelation, but might mislead you to think that other Pearl Jam albums are of the same kind.
B00082IJ08|5.0|This album is not only fun to listen to, but it captures the gestalt of my generation, finally! (gen X) <br />The theme of environmental degredation being an issue of bad guys vs. cartoon herooes is oddly what has become the truth in our world. It seems that it will take the child within, our inner cartoon hero to rise up to SAVE US ALL against the bad guys because our normal human-shell selves just aren't doing it.  <br />A lot of people will read this review and say \\"this person is goofy, its a great album to listen to, not a treatise.\\" But it really is a seminal album, like the Beatles white album, in a way. Every song is technically masterful. The craft is good, the energy is good, the beats rock. Each song subtley captures it's own genre.  <br />Regardless of what I've written above, the bottom line is that this album is worth spending the money on no matter your age, rank, or serial number. It's genius!
630512762X|5.0|(Attn ** Spoilers Ahead!)  <br /> <br />Improbable? Yes? Fun to watch? Double yes. A movie with impossible and illogical lunacy better do something special to make it work and keep you glued to the screen. Well, Face Off is one of those movies, it's amazing how good the movie is (out of line logic aside) John Woo is a genius! Face Off starts out with a very morbid scene of Travolta's (Sean Archer's) son getting killed by Cage (Castor Troy) and may even draw some tears to the ladies, but from that point on, it's just non-stop action movie to boot and a massive battle between the good guy and the bad guy!   <br /> <br /> The movie indulges itself with a very good (but crazy script) and some very clever lines. Fine acting from the newbies and of course Cage and Travolta are the perfect match for this one. How could anyone seriously not love this movie? Case in point, my girlfriend watched this for the first time a few nights ago and she had tears, laughed, and jumped out of her seat about 5 times and said \\"that was amazing, that's Cage's best movie.\\" I also heard \\"oh my God, oh my God\\" out of her a dozen times. The movie simply keeps you involved and that's why it's so great. It's about being fun, and Face Off is one of those movies that you'll want to watch over again. It's fast, funny, morbid, but most importantly, fun!  You'll see crazy things like Cage getting dressed up as a priest and doing a dance to the Halleilujah chorus, you'll see an FBI agent and a psychological madman trade faces and bodies and battle it out, you'll see speed boats crashing into eachother on a lake and colliding with other boats, you'll see planes get blown up, crazy gun fights between Cage and Travolta, you'll see guns and more guns too, you'll see Cage tell a story about his wife cracking a tooth on a rice seed, you'll see Travolta *Archer* throw a guy on a corvette and beat the crap out of him for attacking his daughter, you'll see the final clash between Archer and Troy in one of the best action sequences I've ever seen. <br /> <br />The music in the movie is very well orchestrated, it's a bit reminiscent of the \\"Speed\\" movies and really gets your blood churning. I do have a minor nitpick in the movie. Toward the end some of the stunt devils look pretty bad and don't look like Cage and Travolta at all, people with big screens watching these movies will laugh seeing these guys, they really don't look anything like them. The movie is nearly over two hours though and you'll truly never get bored once, I guarantee it. Anyone who says this movie isn't fun doesn't enjoy movies, because this is what movies should be like, just fun and crazy! Do yourself a favor and buy this movie before people forget out it. It's my personal favorite action movie of all time!
0316172324|5.0|Popularizing scientific research is always a dicey game. Gladwell does it better than many, especially in the complicated arena of cognitive science. He oversimplifies things, but he has a knack for looking at the human/social consequences of whatever it is he's discussing.<br /><br />BLINK promotes some pop-psych stereotypes I wish he'd dealt with more cogently. That applies in particular to his imprecise use of terms relating to the distinction between what we are aware of and what goes on in that 80+% of our brains that we don't have explicit ('conscious') access to. I guess I would have liked some more neural science here. But keep I remind myself that it is a book intended for a mostly non-scientific audience; and maybe one has to tone down the science-speak these days, for the sake of broadening the spectrum of those buying the book, who would otherwise not have bothered.<br /><br />All in all an excellent and worthwhile piece of popular science, tackling what is a difficult subject and showing clearly that, as with all things, the powers of our minds always hold as much promise as danger.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNE

6304779356|5.0|Released in the late 80's, The Lost Boys transcends all horror movies of that era, and proves much more memorable. It gives you that irreplaceable feeling that only the 80's movies can provide. With seriously hardcore style, a great soundtrack and clever punch lines, The Lost Boys makes any night in, a great night in.    Schumacher has utilised horror, comedy, action and drama to create this masterpiece. There is just enough gore to satisfy horror fans, but not too much to repulse the rest of us. The humour is not in-your-face like other comedies; The Lost Boys doesn't try to be funny, it just is. There's plenty of vamp-on-vamp action and special effects that don't seem to have aged much (yes, Star Wars fan can watch this and not be nauseated).     You probably know the storyline, so I won't go into the details. Basically, the new kid in town, Michael starts hanging around the wrong crowd, in the hope of getting a girl. Unfortunately, they give him blood to drink and he is forced to be like them - creatures of the night. We briefly see Michaels struggle with his new identity, and he doesn't like it much. So, his younger brother and two self-proclaimed `vampire experts' try to find and destroy the head vampire in order to return Michael back to his normal state. The rest is all blood spurts, garlic necklaces, holy water, staking and one-liners.    What I love about this movie is that 80's feeling it gives me. Schumacher realised that style was the key to setting The Lost Boys apart and he completely saturates in style. The soundtrack, clothes, actors are brilliantly combined, so that, watching The Lost Boys 20 years later, you still remember distinctly what the 80's was. You'll always find visual candy infused in every scene. From the opening ocean and city scene, with Cry Little Sister, to the colourful boardwalks buzzing with activity. From ultra-buff Tim Capello jamming out to I Still Believe on his sax at the concert, to the comic bookstore. Watch it, absorb it,savour it.     The soundtrack boasts such hits as `Cry Little Sister,' which makes the opening scene hypnotic in a sense. `Good Times' (INXS) and `Walk This Way' (Aerosmith) lighten up the hardcore scenes. `Laying Down the Lay' (INXS) and `I Still Believe' (Capello) truly make you feel as if you were right there, in the movie, in the 80's.    The DVD features are most impressive. Here's a run down on my favourites:    The Retrospective Documentary is entertaining. Schumacher always is great to hear from and takes up in depth, into the movie's production, casting, etc.     The Return of Sam and the Frog Brothers allows you to switch between Corey Haim, Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlanders commentaries of their scenes together. However, Haim is quite boring here, he mostly just tells you what was going on in the scene ( as if you didn't know anyway). \\"The 2 Coreys\\" takes a look at how they met, their friendship etc, good for those hardcore Corey duo fans.    In \\"The Lost Scenes\\" you get to see 15 or so twenty second cuts. It is interesting to see the other direction Schumacher could have taken the movie in.    However, if you want it all, and I mean IT ALL, purchase the Lost Boys today. If you want the cute actors, gore, humour, action, galore, get it now. It serves great for watching with friends and its one of those timeless classics that you'll never get sick of watching. Guaranteed to bring guffaws, tension and reminiscent feelings of the 80's every time. A must for all 80's fans.

B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of The Moon by Pink Floyd is one of the greatest albums ever created. Most of the songs are works of art. But i think that Animals is a little bit better. MOst may disagree with me but i just like animals better. Still a great album and you should defiently but it if your a rock entusiast.
0440237688|5.0|My children and their teachers recommended this book as a school read and wanting to read what they read I got the book.  I have to agree with my children (both in their early teens) that the book is excellent.  Sure it is about a society that seems perfect but it is more than that.  Lois Lowry did a very good job of building the perfection of their world \\"The Community)and \\"release\\" was obvious but in between I was really impressed with how Jonas began to see things so differently.  Forget the rest of any complaints on the book...It really was a good thought-provoking book that holds a message about the importance of memories in our lives.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I won't repeat what others have already said, but I did observe several parallels to the great sci-fi classic \\"Forbidden Planet\\".<br /><br />First, the obvious tribute in the form of the research ship named C57D, the name of United Planets cruiser in FP.<br /><br />Also, there's the theme of a utopia that tries to go one step too far and suffers the unintended consequence of releasing \\"monsters from the ID\\" (not identified explicitly as such, but that's what the reavers are) and ends up self-destructing.<br /><br />Then there's the scene with the heroes hiding behind the blast doors with the monsters on the other side, which parallels a similar scene at the end of FP, only with different results.<br /><br />Finally, I liked the message that when government goes too far in trying to make everyone feel good, unintended consequences result.  Genuinely a message for the times we live in, if you think about it a little.<br /><br />Thanks Joss!!!
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta is incredible, this coming from a person that use to listen bands like AFI, Trapt, Coldplay, Incubus. I like rock all kinds like you see. And Nothing I mean nothing compares to the Rock Sound that comes from The Mars Volta. And This Record, Deloused in the Comatorium. Is So good Ive listened to it non stop in my car stereo for a good 4 months. Its just a perfect album, all the diffrent sounds blend so well, the jazz the hard rock the awesome guitar from omar. And finally Cedrics voice mixes perfectly with the music. Its a awesome album to listen to. This is what happens when a band doesnt try to be cliche and try to reinvent ROCK, Its a masterpiece. this is a 10/10 album. Might Go down as one of the greatest albums ever.

6304039506|5.0|Elia Kazan's marvelous adaptation of Tennessee Williams award winning play is enhanced with some truly impeccable acting performances.  Amazingly Marlon Brando who cemented his place in cinematic history with his portrayal of the brutish, volatile and sensual lout Stanley Kowalski was the only main player denied an Academy Award.  Vivien Leigh, Karl Malden and Kim Hunter all garnered Oscars for their roles.<br /><br />Leigh playing neurotic and fading Southern belle Blanche Dubois arrives in New Orleans complete with her fragile disposition to stay with her nurturing sister Stella played by Kim Hunter in the seedy French Quarter of New Orleans.  Blanche hiding a sordid past had been run out of Laurel, Mississippi, fired from her teaching position for having an affair with a 17 year old boy.<br /><br />Blanche received a warm reception from Stella but then Stanley enters the scene.  Brando's hackles are immediately raised when he learned than Blanche had mortgaged the family estate Belle Reve and frittered away the proceeds depriving Stella of her share.  Although Stella and Stanley had an often violent relationship they were deeply in love.  The inevitable clash between the coarse Stanley and the genteel Blanche drove a wedge into their relationship creating major histrionics.<br /><br />Blanche desperately wanted to start her life anew and Stanley's buddy Mitch played by Karl Malden had potential to be her life preserver and possible husband.  Stanley however informed Mitch of Blanche's shady past and those plans became aborted.<br /><br />The inevitable climax occurred when the pregnant Stella rushed to the hospital to deliver leaving Stanley and Blanche alone in their tiny apartment.  Stanley being Stanley successfully pushed Blanche over the edge with his actions, reducing her to a delusional shell of herself and needing to be institutionalized.<br /><br />Kazan's choice of the sordid settings of the Kowalski's apartment certainly magnified the fall from grace suffered by the psychologically fragile Blanche.  The curious choice of the name of the apartment Elysian Fields, the mythical resting place for the blameless dead, provided foreshadowing for the drama that was to unfold.  The legendary acting performances chronicling a myriad of, at times, dysfunctional interpersonal relationships were an impressive sight to behold, richly deserving of all the accolades.from grace suffered by the psychologically fragile Blanche.

B000002I8D|5.0|Face Value is no doubt his best album in his carrer.  Yes, even better than anything he did with genesis.  He trades the synth and progressive sound for a motown and introspective approach.  He is nearly perfect, except for the cover of Tomorrow never knows which was just weird and don't fit with the rest of the album.  This is also the most organic material Phil has recorded.  After this his music will still be good but, nothing as magical.  There are great horn sections, introspective piano, and occasional guitar.  The roof is leaking is probably one of his best songs of his carrer.  Also, songs like droned and hand in hand word together as a post the roof is leaking.  It was like he told a story and then the mood set.  The aftermath sets in after it is all set and done.  This is also is most varied album is many ways vocally and musically.  Sure his vocals weren't quite up to say No Jacket Required or even But Seriously.  He more than makes up for it with his organic and varied sound.

B000002IST|3.0|We can't dance features Phil Collins as the leader of Genesis.  This album is probably the most stripped down album they recorded.  Before, synth overpowered the rhythmn section.  Now there are more hints of actual guitar and the drums sound more crisp than they have in a while.  This approach is a great idea except the album is inconsistent.  The first 5 tracks convinced me at first that this was one of their better albums.  After that the second half falls off with the exception of Hold on My Heart. I think they tried to be more progressive on the second half but it comes out boring and too long.  With Drive the Last Spike the song is too long but it is meant to be long.  Besides it is worth for the bobasting climax.  The guitars layer and Phil's voice is full of passion, impossible to not try to sing along.  It is a pretty good album but not their best.

B00008OLYN|5.0|Here's why: <br />I just read your \\"review\\" of Opeth's Damnation and know deep down in my heart that you are probably 15 years old so I should forgive you for being a dumbass. <br />First thing- the \\"music\\" YOU listen to is crap. Papa Roach? You lost all of your credibility right there. Then there is the other garbage you listen to...Trapt, Tap-root...wow did Mtv create you as their mainstream teeny bopper moron? Then in your other reviews you have the gal to compare Rage Against the Machine and System of a Down to ...P.O.D? What the...? You sir are an idiot. Rage and System are probably the only 2 mainstream bands that had any value to come out of America in the past 10 years. Back on track. <br />To compare Staind to Opeth is like comparing $hit to the opposite of $hit. You claim America created Prog rock with Pink Floyd....PINK FLOYD ISN'T AMERICAN YOU MORON. Last thing, I'm assuming that either you are a typical moron hick from Texas (which is probably true) or you are just reviewing possible good albums poorly because either: A. You dont have any talent yourself or B. You are just trying to get a rise out of people for attention. <br />If you are the future of this country then we are all screwed. God help us all. <br />This album was great and I recommend it to people who have good taste in music.
0596009208|5.0|I've been a professional programmer for years and I had to learn Java fast to stay in my current engagement.  The \\"Learn-Java-In-24-Hours\\" style books had appealing titles but instead I decided to try this weird, truly different approach to learning because O'Reilly published it.  (I have been familiar with O'Reilly for years and always recognized them as a top-flight publisher, although their books often had a formal, college-textbookish tone that made them better reference books than read-thru books.)  I was put off by the graphics-intensive comic book style when I paged through the sample on-line at Amazon but decided to give it a try.   <br /> <br />I think they're really on to something here.  I can only speak for myself, as someone who already has a background in programming, but I believe the book actually works.  Over a couple weeks I read the book, did the little puzzles and exercises which the authors were so insistent that I do, and was really surprised at the depth of knowledge I came out with at the other end.   <br /> <br />Sitting in a developer's meeting yesterday I was really surprised that, while I clearly didn't have the years of experience the other coders had, I had no problem keeping up and was even able to contribute.  I'm now moving in to the new assignment fairly well and am confident that I'll be able to pick up the details of this language now that I've got such a good grounding from this book.   <br /> <br />I've now ordered the companion O'Reilly volumes on Enterprise JavaBeans and Design Patterns and am curious to see if they can maintain the same level of quality.  Those skills would really seem to set a programmer apart, a critical consideration in a world where the competition is getting better (and unfortunately cheaper) every day.

Isn't that why we love to read? What sets this book apart isn't just that it tells the tale of King Arthur through the lives of the women of that time and place, but that it is so flawlessly and eloquently written. There is such an authentic feel to it and the characters and places are so well developed that I was mesmerized from cover to cover.<br /><br />I know so many people who call this their favorite book. It doesn't matter male or female, people who love a book that can take them to another world and who love the world of King Arthur will appreciate this book.
B00025ETIW|1.0|This has to be the singually worst sounding CD I have bought since linken park. The entire thing is clipped to hell with any dynamics totally removed from it.
1400032717|4.0|Sometimes there are books or movies that I recognize are well done but are still unsuited to me personally. Like modern art, I can sometimes recognize the genius but still not want it in my house. This book was like that for me. I finished it last night, at one sitting, and was never bored. I have a master's in math (the protagonist excelled in math) and while I hope my social skills exceed the boy's (he was autistic)- I can certainly identify at some level there as well. In spite of all this, and of the fact that the book was written from the perspective (I suppose for the first time) of a 15 year old autistic boy, I did not find it endearing. I cannot help but identify strongly with the protagonist of a story, and if that person is an unpleasant character I find the experience distasteful. Of course the boy could not help it, but he was one of the most narcissistic individuals I've encountered in literature. The book reminded me in many ways of \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\", a book I also admired from a literary point of view but did not like the mood it created in me.<br /><br />The plot is less important than the style in this book, but briefly stated it concerns an autistic boy's attempt to solve a mystery in the neighborhood as well as write about it. The amazing, and I emphasize amazing, feature of this book is the ability of the author to write so brilliantly from the perspective of an autistic child. I've never known anyone truly autistic, so it is a bit of a presumption, but it seems to have been carried off perfectly by the author.<br /><br />A couple of asides that may illustrate both what I liked and what bothered me about this book. At one point Christopher (the boy, I don't think I ever got around to mentioning his name) discusses a math problem called the \\"Monty Hall Problem\\", that while seemingly intuitive was actually somewhat complex. Many math PhD's wrote in dogmatically protesting what they felt was an incorrect answer given by Marilyn vos Savant to the Monty Hall Problem, and just that many were shown to be wrong, regardless of the vehemence of their conviction otherwise. They were also convinced that it was very unlikely that so many of them, as the mathematical authorities of the country, could be in error. How about that?<br /><br />The other story, and I think revealingly related, comes about as Christopher explains a bit of why he is an atheist and gives a capsule defense of Darwinism. He then tackles one of the more difficult points, that of how the evolution of irreducibly complex organs/organisms was able to occur. The eye is often used as an example, as people ask what good would half an eye be, as an evolving species would need to have for a time on the mutationous road from blindness to sight. The atheistic voice (speaking through Christopher) points out that 50% of an eye, or even 1% of an eye, would be better than none and would still confer genetic advantage to be passed down to offspring. And this rather reminds me of the first story, because even though tons of scientists dogmatically hold this view, and scoff at those who question it, they are just as blind, if I may say, as those math PhD's from the previous story. Subconsciously or by intelligent design I don't know, but they make a verbal switch from eye to vision and then attack a straw man. No one argues that 50%, or even 1%, of vision is better than none, but for an irreducibly complex system, half an eyeball does not equal half vision, it equals no vision. This is obvious once pointed out, but as the experts are stymied by the limitations of their dogmatic ideology they care not see it.<br /><br />And this brings me to why I recognized this book was extremely well written but ultimately for me unenjoyable. I recognize this as a weakness of mine, and not the fault of the author, and that is why I think it deserves four stars and why I think most people will find it an excellent and unique read. I couldn't get past the sterility and self-centered world that the main character lived in, however. His inability to ever empathize made me feel as if I were reading the diary of a sociopath. I realize this to be a sign that the writer did his job exceedingly well, but a little too well for me to come away smiling.y and self-centered world that the main character lived in, however.

B0000VD04M|3.0|Tim Burton's ED WOOD can't be faulted for its technical expertise.  Burton has captured the feel of the fifties and evokes a sense of warped nostalgia in chronicling the misadventures of one of Hollywood's worst movie makers.  While Johnny Depp captures the mystique of this man, I never felt empathic towards him or his vast collection of really awful movies.  It is Oscar Winner Martin Landau whose performance as Bela Lugosi truly embodies what this movie is all about.  His portrayal of the legendary Dracula is tragic in his quest to capitalize on a faded stardom.  The fact that he appeared in so many of Wood's movies only underscores this tragedy.  The movie includes nice turns from Bill Murray, George Steele, Vincent d'Onofrio, Lisa Marie, Patricia Arquette and Sarah Jessica Parker, but ultimately I found it boring.  Unquestionably good moviemaking, but not necessarily good entertainment.
B000BGPKJ4|5.0|The thema of the movie is that how far the man who is in love with a woman can be involved in her world, and also is that how far actors can be involved in their role.    I admire two leading actors, Isabell Huppert and Benoit Magimel, for thier courage to act these characters. They each got the best actoress and actor in Cannes 2002, they deserve it and should be given.    Erika, a main character and Huppert acted, had been a lack of sexial relationship with men then in a way she lost control of her desire outside school and home. However the movie reprensents it so directly then I can not get involved with. That is something I need to understand but I don't want to see.    Benoir Magimel, I became a fan of his by the movie, he is beautiful and attractive in the movie and that charm is even strange in his character. It is so strange a young attractive man fell in love with a woman like Erika and it takes so long time to realize and leave her.     The story tells us that it is fantasy love makes people strong and beautiful. Many of French movies represent this idea any way.    I don't recommend you to watch this movie, however if you want to challenge how far you can be involved as an audience with  realistic, do it, maybe that worth it.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Like so many here, I am curious about Bob's life ... especially the early years. Seems to be so much just passed over or avoided on this dvd ... so there's still a lot of mystery. What about his family, parents and so on?  <br /> <br />The one gripe I have is that Bob's MAIN influence once he hit New York was easily Ramblin' Jack Elliot!!! I mean they even called Dylan \\"Son of Jack' back then. Jack lived with Woody and his family basically ... Dylan just visited Woody in the hospital once I believe. It was Jack's mannerisms and more advanced guitar techniques that Dylan copped to perfection. I don't think there was even a mention of Ramblin Jack in this documentary!!! For shame Bobbie. <br /> <br />A great companion dvd is 'Ballad Of Ramblin' Jack' done by his estranged daughter. A better documentary in my opinion on many levels if one is interested in the times when Dylan and so many fantastic folk artists bloomed in NY. You'll gain a ton more insight regarding Woody via Arlo and his sister and learn a few new things about Dylan along the way. <br /> <br />I was let down that Dylan and Martin avoided the area of Bob's greatest influence back in those days. Watch both and you'll see what I mean. Otherwise, fun to see the old footage and relive those wonderful days of real music.

B000B0WODA|4.0|I bought this the day it came out on Dual disc.  The DVD side is fun to watch and see the musicians off stage and behind the scenes.  They are very impressively creative...even trying to record a babbling brook for effect despite it sounding like rubbish and being axed from the final mix.  They are great song writers, and the pop mix of 80s rock, funk and rockabilly is refreshing in today's declining music scene.  I love their first album so much that I had to give this album one less star, but this album is a very solid second album.  You won't go wrong with it if you like the first record.
1881273156|4.0|When I read \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" years ago I thought that it gave too generic of an explanation of how people communicate.  When I picked it up again recently after my marriage broke down, I got even more frustrated, because I knew my husband was a Martian and I am a Venutian, but that didn't help save our marriage!  So, when my psychologist  recommended that I read this book, I balked, but was pleasantly suprised that it contained helpful information that is not gender-based and focusses on how to express love rather than just understand it. Expressing love is something that I never really thought about (whether I was doing it right or not) until my husband had an affair, and then I knew that we were not expressing love to each other in the way that we needed to feel loved by the other.  This book helped me to identify the way I need him to express his love to me, and hopefully if my husband reads it too (or at least takes the test at the end) I will know how to better make him feel loved by me.  The book is basic, but with good examples, and filled with some good \\"ah, ha!\\" stories that help to put the author's explanations in context.  If nothing else, the tests at the end (separate ones designed for females vs. males) helped me to know what I need to feel loved, and what really doesn't matter to me very much.  I think if this can be used as a basis for discussion between mates on the topic of making sure each feels loved, this can be very helpful.  And, I would recommend reading it BEFORE your relationship hits any stumbling blocks!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This is one of the best concert DVDs to date!  The audio is almost sparkling, and the camera work is superb.  I have been watching it in DTS 5.1 surround, and it blows me away every time.  I have watched it every night this week.  Cream sounds FRESH as FRESH can be!<br /><br />I have to say first of all, Ginger Baker is one hell of a drummer...especially at his age.  His solo on Toad is worth every penny of this DVD's price tag.  His timing is impeccable, which is a must with two musicians soloing on every song.<br /><br />Second, I was very impressed with Jack Bruce.  He can still pull off his vocal style just as he did back in the day.  Not to mention his bass lines are right on the money.  I love his riffing on Born Under a Bad Sign.  He walks all over the neck, but always comes back to the root notes.<br /><br />Third, and not last by any stretch of the imagination, Eric Clapton is in his element.  I have grown tired of Clapton's work over the last couple of decades, but here his playing is fresh and alive again.  His set up on stage is very simple...a few combo amps, wah pedal, and other amenities...but it is really just him and his guitar.  It is how Eric Clapton should be heard...in a trio where he can play tasty rhythmic parts or flying high solos with only bass, drums and vocals to accompany his fabulous playing.

Unravel gets to the heart of where I suppose Bjork was emotionally at the time - quite revealing, albeit simple. All Neon Like - A first rate lullaby.  Alarm Call demands attention. All Is Full Of LOve reminds us why we listen to this cerebral poet in the first place.  And the cover art alone is incredibly beautiful!! For open minds.  Let it wash over you.  Don't treat it like a pop record. This is an experience!!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|cream had without doubt been the greatest of the bands for me and it has always been a regret for me not to have seen one of their legendary live performances (i think i was born around the time they played their legendary filmore set). so this concert naturally verged on being a near religious experience for me.    this is not really the cream of the old. the members have changed and evolved - both personally and musically.   age seems to have caught up with the lord of the low frequencies - the great jack bruce (my favoritest cream member) more than the others. clapton looks the least affected in that aspect. considering the legendary rivalries between the members of the band, bruce seems more mellow and warmer and baker friendlier and inspired.    bruce despite obvious signs of aging, still manages to give a credible vocal performance (amongst all the white boy blues bands of yore who cut their teeth in making covers of blues standards, bruce was one of the few who could truly match with the original blues masters in vocal delivery - unlike bands like yardbirds who often sounded like boys imitating men). the \\"slow hand\\" is hardly slow anymore (hasnt been in a long time infact) having incorporated rapid runs across the fretboard in his musical arsenal. also he now prefers the stratocaster to the gibson es-335 he seems to have favored during his cream days (fender btw has reciprocated by naming an axe after clapton in its stratocaster series). so when the band after winding up with \\"i'm so glad\\" takes on interpreting the old blues classic \\"spoonful\\" (its earlier attempt at it in filmore east - wheels of fire disc 2 - having already attained such a revered hallowed status as probably the greatest live jam in the history of rock), we can clearly see the difference. though i prefer the earlier interpretation (where clapton is 'slow' but still deadly and bruce's probing bass provides the able foil) still the new effort is a different experience altogether - highly inspired. you'll not see clapton playing like this with anybody else. bruce's supple bass playing and baker's gunpowder drumming seems to galvanize the god to break out with searing inspired solos. likewise you can see clapton playing like never before in the hypnotic solo  to politician. btw with cream, fretplay always means both guitar and bass - bruce is amongst the greatest of bass players ever to grace rockdom. likewise with ginger baker being an exceptional drummer (the reason they named themselves the 'cream'). so clapton isnt the only \\"god\\" here!    i have alway felt that the cream always excelled in playing covers of classic blues numbers - like crossroads, spoonful, sitting on top of the world, i'm so glad, rollin and tumblin, born under a bad sign etc. in this concert this truth is brought to the fore. though they also play their standards - sunshine of your love (clapton unfortunately sucks here!), badge, white room etc still it is their rendition of the blues standards which shine.    after seeing this concert it is almost impossible not to look back and wonder at musical legacy they would have created, if they hadnt broken up (especially in their prime - check the 4 killer studio tracks in their last album goodbye). but cest la vie i guess.    great once in a lifetime concert (in 5.1 surround sound) this. GET IT!    also check out the dvd of the 70th birthday reunion of john mayall.

B00005221M|3.0|This movie becomes twice as powerful with a little bit of home editing.  Keep opening scene (marred by stiff deer and stagehand)but then skip to arrival of Duncan in the carriage.  As such, this becomes a story from the point of view of the young ladies, taken out of merry old England and thrust into the bewildering savagery of the colonies.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|Guilty is truly the gold (or I should say multi-platinum)standard for Barbra's Pop albums. This 25th annivesry edition makes it a great time to re-visit this masterpiece.<br /><br />Guilty also benefited from being in the right place at the right time. In 1980, Disco had dimmed, it would be over a year before the \\"Urban Cowboy/Country\\" craze would hit, and it would not be until later in 1982 that Dance music would re-merge as a force on the Pop charts.<br /><br />1980 would proove to be year in which mid-tempo and Adult Contemporary music would do very well and Guilty delivered (and then some).<br /><br />Women In Love, the lead single and a number 1 single as well, was a fresh sound for Barbra, it is playful and sexy without going over the top. Barry Gibb the production wizard behind this album duets with her on 2 tracks; the 2nd number 1 release, Guilty, and a great ballad track, What Kind of Fool.<br /><br />Other notable songs included here include; the mid-tempo Never Give Up, and Promises, the ballad, The Love Inside, and the albums final cut, Make It Like A Memory, where her voice soars to new heights.<br /><br />Barbra had released other great Pop albums in the 70's (Wet, Super Women, etc.) and a truly stellar one (Stoney End), but Guilty trumped them all in terms of sales and approachability.<br /><br />This special \\"dual disk\\" contains some good bonus footage, and the highlight to me being a clip of her and Barry Gibb from her One Voice benefit concert taped at her home in 1985. I frankly enjoyed One Voice better than her 1996 Concert Tour, as Once Voice featured 2 songs from Guilty, while her 96 tour focused on her Broadway and Hollywood show/movie tunes and other more traditional recordings.<br /><br />Guilty, the original Guilty Pleasure!
B000AXSN5G|4.0|J'tais sceptique quant  la qualit du nouvel album de Neil Young, \\"Prairie Wind\\".  Depuis \\"Broken Arrow\\" en 1996, aucun album, mis  part peut-tre \\"Silver and Gold\\", qui contient toutefois quelques chansons ordinaires (\\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\", \\"Razor Love\\", qui ont toutefois t les plus populaires (allez savoir pourquoi !), n'a su vritablement me charmer.  \\"Are You Passionate ?\\" me semble tre le moins bon Young des 10 dernires annes, alors que \\"Greendale\\" contient quelques chansons intressantes, mais rien pour casser la baraque, et \\"Road Rocks\\", un album \\"live\\" somme toute ordinaire, aussi ordinaire que le jeu de drums de Keltner qui prend tout l'avant-scne.  Avec \\"Prairie Wind\\", finalement, on retrouve un Neil Young videmment dchir par la mort de son pre (\\"It's A Dream\\", entre autres).  On retrouve un auteur qui, de toute sa carrire, (re)fait ce qu'il a toujours su faire le mieux : un album acoustique, introspectif, avec une voix et des riffs de guitare comme dans le bon vieux temps.   <br />lectrique, Neil ne me semble plus tre en mesure de livrer la marchandise.  Le \\"son Neil Young\\" des dbuts jusqu' Broken Arrow, il l'a perdu.  Le feedback de sa vieille (fausse) Gibson ainsi que ses solos  la \\"Down by the river\\", \\"Southern Man\\", \\"Cortez the Killer\\", o sont-ils rendus ?  C'tait pourtant ce qui distinguait Neil Young de la plupart des autres.  C'tait sa marque de commerce. <br />Ceci dit, mon commentaire se rsume  cela : Neil Young est imbattable ct acoustique.  \\"Prairie Wind\\" s'inscrit  mon avis dans la ligne des \\"Harvest\\" et \\"Harvest Moon\\", bien loin d'atteindre leur perfection, il va de soi, mais digne de mention. <br /> couter, sans contredit !
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bob Harris (Bill Murry) is an american actor who is spending some time in Tokyo to shoot some whisky adds.  He doesn't want to be there.  But then again, you get the impression he doesn't want to be home either.  Bob is in what appears to be a loveless marriage, or at least a marriage falling out of love.  His wife, as he puts it, doesn't need him around anymore, and as she puts its, she's getting used to him never being around.  He's always away shooting movies or adds like this one.  Charlotte (Scarlott Johansson) is a twenty-five year old bride of two years whose photographer husband (Giovanni Rabisi) would rather spend time with an actress (Anna Farris) he seems to be smitten with.  Charlotte and Bob have a few things in common.  They are in Tokyo against their will and they pretty much hate the idea.  They are both in relationships not even strong enough to lean on and they are lost in themselves.  Charlotte doesn't know what she wants to do with her life and in a way Bob is in the same boat.  They form a relationship based on their similarities and they spend their time together hoping form karyokie bars and hot spots to cocktail bars and hotel rooms.  The movie revolves around getting to know these two lost souls.  Bill Murry does amazing here.  He's spot on displaying the feeling of being alone, being lonely and searching for hope in something, anything.  He's a great actor and portrays that wonderfully here.  He's funny and desprate all at the same time.  Scarlott, who I believe to be one of the most talented and beautiful young actresses around does unbelievable here and I agree with the millions who were pissed she didn't recieve an oscar nod.  She portrays the lovetorn wife, finding the attention she lacks from her mate in a man she barely knows but is drawn to for obvious reasons.  This is an all around wonder of a film and should be expierienced again and again.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This album is as good now as it was when it was released.  Actually, maybe it's better now!
B00005JNY4|4.0|I personally enjoyed this movie.  It has thrills and chills and beautiful scenery (and the waters pretty too)...  Jared (Walker) and Sam (Alba!) are a hot couple just getting by in the Bahamas.  Jared was just fired from his scuba instructing job and so he is now fixated on finding treasure.  Bryce (Caan) and Amanda (Scott) are visiting from New York.  Bryce and Jared and Sam were friends as kids and Amanda, a girl Bryce picked up the night before, is just along for the bumpy ride.  Caan serves as the comedic portion of the film, even when he's serious.  Eventually the four strike rich in two areas.  They find treasure and they find drugs...a whole lot of drugs...drugs that someone wants back.  The rest of the movie from that point on has its share of intesity and it's share of gore, yes I said gore...between the shark attacks there is quite a bit of blood.  I was shocked.  Regardless, Alba is hot and even Ashley Scott has her moments and the plot is prety good...don't listen to the idiots who knock it, it's a fun movie that everyone can enjoy.
B000001Y2U|1.0|wooooooooooooh, this was an explosion in my ears. manson is so snazzy that he makes me less snazzy, and im pretty freakin snazzy,becouse i play guitar and i rock the house , but not in comparisson to him becouse hes more goolish since he wheres make up and sings about antichristism. i just sing about love. manson scares the crap out of me and i am a fearless man. its so cool that he likes satan, not enough ppl do. he truly is the big hungry car becouse hes so fast and he could out run any of you.hes fast.his eyes are not equal in color becouse of his contact lenses he cleverly puts in his eye balls to make them look all different and scary,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! hes even scaryer the the sasquatch,i mean picture what the sasquatch would sing about. well manson is ten times that scary. and thats pretty freakin scary. and hes more of a rebel then the sasquatch too. he gets so many chicks. chicks with large breasts and a sasquatch fetish but hes better so he steels them from the sasquatch, and the sasquatch is mad but he wont fight with manson becouse his arms a strings compared to manson.  <br />and <br />so yea if you mess with manson he will kill your fun with death
B000BKJ78U|4.0|Do not let all those old pessimists who fear change prevent you from buying this set. In the 2004 release, lucas was able to finish the movies HE made to help bring the entire saga full circle. Now according to previous reviewers nothing beats those good old CBS/VHS tapes, but if you want to experiance the saga the way it was meant to be seen pick up this set. This set is great for those who just want the movies without all the extras. If you enjoy great commentary and documentaries I highly recommend the 2004 realese.
B0007O38F8|2.0|How can people give this 5 stars. Whoever gives this 5 stars has the lamest taste in music, no joke. Just listen to the boring production. Production is half the battle in rap/hip-hop because it has to make up for the fact that rappers usually don't SING A MELODY. The instrumentals are all horrible, with the exception of the excellent standout track, 'Outta Control'. The only time I listen to this album is to hear 'Outta Control'. It's hot. <br /> <br />As for 50's lyrical ability.......It's certainly not as good as it was on his debut album. Yes, he took 9 bullets and he deserves to brag all he wants. But that doesn't make him an excellent rapper. Why can't people distinguish good music from bad music? If you want to hear EXCELLENT production with good meaningful lyrics, listen to Kanye West or Outkast. However, if you are satisfied with this dull crap, keep buying into it. It's your decision.
B00004R9A4|5.0|This is a great movie in my opinion.  I always saw it as a child on television every once and a while and was truly thrilled when i discovered it had been released on dvd.  It is a very unique movie putting both live action and animation together in an entertaining way.  I am 32 years old and feel i'm still a child at heart and this movie always brings out the child in me.
B000B0WODA|2.0|Really, what do people hear in this group?  Reading some reviews, they sounded interesting, and I enjoy some of their influences.  However, after hearing both of the first two records, I can only conclude that the bank lacks both musicianship and strong songs.  There's just not enough interesting material here to prop up an album, and even the obviously commercial \\"singles\\" are somewhat boring and derivative.  These guys would be better off honing their skills a few more years before being thrust before the world by the media as the next big thing.  Also, the mastering courtesy of notorious record-ruiner Howie Weinberg is an abomination.
B000002I2M|5.0|'LA Woman', is not just a good Doors album, its an all time masterpiece within the history of Rock and Roll. Its not just because of all the attention the compilation got following Morrison untimely death, its just a great album! <br />   Its the Doors first album without their veteran producer Paul Rothchild (Who quit because he was fed up with the band..especially Morrisons erratic behavior). Nervously, The Doors co-produced the record (Keeping Bruce Botnik), and it turned out to be the best move they made in their entire career. <br />    'LA Woman' is filled with everything the Doors has built their legacy upon. It features Jims brilliant poetry (Especially in tracks like 'LA Woman' and 'WASP (Texas Radio and The Big Beat)' as well as great rockin' blues (With songs like 'The Changeling' and 'Cars Hiss By My Window'), theres even some jazz ('Riders On The Storm') and Psychadelic Rock ('L'America and Haycinth House). <br />     Shedding his snake skin boots and leather pants, Morrison laid the Lizard King to rest introducing a more creative poet-Mr. MoJo Rising. Theres nothing bad to say about this album, even with Jims alcohol infested voice, it works well with the content of the songs presented. <br />      EVERY serious Rock and Roll fan should own this album, if not for its greatness but for keepsake. <br /> <br />
B000002BBY|1.0|and poor ones at that.<br /><br />With Oasis albums, all one has to do is just hum a Beatles tune and guarantee it matches the melody of Oasis's \\"songs.\\"<br /><br />It's one thing to pay tribute to a band but it's quite another to blatantly rip them off, and then have the gall to badmouth one of the greatest guitar players in music history!  (The late George Harrison had more talent in his pubic hair than Liam or Noel Gallagher have in their entire bodies combined...and then some.)<br /><br />The brothers Gallagher obviously never heard of the saying that \\"you can imitate but never duplicate.\\"  If it were legally possible for them to just put their name to the Beatles catalogue, they would have done it long ago without thinking about it.<br /><br />These little boys apparently have zero concept of the word \\"originality.\\"<br /><br />But the saddest part of all is that people actually gush over these losers as if they're original or something special.  Maybe it would be too much work to listen to the people who gave Oasis their careers - that would be The Beatles.<br /><br />Liam Gallagher in his wildest dreams will NEVER reach the height of creativity - drugged up or straight - that Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr did.  He can make the asinine claim that Oasis are greater than The Beatles but time always gets the last laugh (let's see if Oasis has the vast cultural influence the Fab Four did back in the 60's - an influence that continues to this day.  As it stands now, they have TONS of catching up to do).<br /><br />If it weren't for the constant tabloid reports on Liam's latest fight with his brother Noel (and everyone else) or his sexual exploits, people would have forgotten them (like they should have been) long ago.<br /><br />Keep smoking whatever it is you're toting, Liam, because your little group is nothing but yet another glorified, overexposed garage band.
B000002HJD|2.0|When Jim Morrison recorded the poetry for what ended up being the album 'American Prayer' he purposely did not want any of the other members of the band to join him.  Jim Morrison and The Doors did NOT record the poetry together but its unfortunate that the remaining members had to go against their dead friends wishes and taint the sanctity of these tracks with ball room jazz and fluff that sound nothing like The Doors.  Take what the band did to these recordings and strip them down to the bone and you have a masterpiece.  They overproduced, and overedited the sacred works of a dead poet and its a shame.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Its a great movie. Its has been 15 years and still keeps its charming
B000002I25|4.0|Most people attribute their liking to The Doors (The band) as a result of this album.  What a way for a new band to explode onto the music scene! 'Break On Through' is one of the best debut songs in the history of Rock and Roll (Statistically speaking) and The Doors couldn't have picked a better song (Which lrically and musically sums up their entire purpose). <br />  'The Doors' (The Album) is also the album, even the most mediocre fan attributes to their liking (Most of their famous material comes from this record). Its full of raw sexual energy and ultra high vibrancy.  If there is only one album by this group you should own...It should be this one!
B00005JO0J|4.0|I see there are a lot of Firefly and Joss Whedon fans in thrall to the movie.  They hit you over the head with their thrall.  Then there are those expecting big splash FX, the kind of FX that carry and make a movie and are disappointed.  There are also the inevitable comparisons to Star Trek, Star Wars and movies/characters that have gone before.  All that is drivel and not in the least flattering to the creator, the movie or the reviewer.<br /><br />So, never saw the series while it was on it's short-lived TV run.  However, after seeing the preview, I was intrigued enough to check out and then purchase the series on DVD and watch it.  I personally don't care that the creator/writer has had other successful series.  This was the one I was focusing on at the moment.  Past success and/or fame does not automatically make something great.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story-line and the characters.  I enjoyed the ambiance of the ship Serenity and it's multiple meaning.  I really loved the fact that in the movie, none of that was changed.  It didn't get bigger or more enhanced because it was being put on the big screen.  Both myself and my husband saw this movie together - he had never seen any of the series.  We both liked it very much.<br /><br />I will not go into specific details about the movie, enough have already done that.  One of the best things I can and will say is we want to see it again and we will add it to our video library.<br /><br />And a parting for those of you appalled that they should kill off two of the orignial cast...has it occurred to you that if there is a revival, they were the only two not to commit and could you see them played by any other actor...
B000002I27|4.0|'Strange Days' is one of those albums where you scratch your head and think \\"What the heck was that all about?\\" after listening to it.  Its opening track (The same as the albums title) will send shivers up and down your spine. 'Horse Latitudes' an innovative recorded work of spoken poetry is insane (Especially when you realize what the poem is all about)! Those teenie bopper fans from the commercial success of first album who are expecting a repeat will be disappointed. This follow up album doesn't necessairly continue in the same footsteps as its predecessor and thats what makes it so good. Sure the radio hits are there ('People Are Strange', 'Love Me Two Times', and 'Moonlight Drive') but the amount of creativity involved in every aspect of this compilation makes those little pop tunes more creative and interesting.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|The story of the Dark Knight detective known as Batman is a story that most people are familiar with.  How Bruce Wayne as a child witnessed the murder of his parents by a common street thug.  After the murder, the criminal was never apprehended and brought to justice, a fact which drove Bruce Wayne to hone his body in the various martial arts, sharpen his mind to become the world's greatest detective, and eventually take on the role of vigilante, by taking the form of a bat to strike fear into the hearts and minds of criminals within Gotham City.  In the 1960's DC Comics and Warner Brothers allowed the `Caped Crusader' to be adapted into a weekly television series, starring Adam West (Bruce Wayne/Batman) and Burt Ward (Dick Grayson/Robin).  The problem with this series is that it chose to make a comedy out of Batman, everything about this series screamed camp!  The series eventually ended, but that would not be the end of Batman's life on TV, after that he appeared in animated form on the kid-friendly \\"Super Friends\\" show, which was basically the Justice League team without the name.  Eventually, \\"Super Friends\\" ended, and once again Batman was left to only appear in the comics. <br /> <br />In 1989, Warner Brothers felt the time was right to begin a film franchise based on the Dark Knight, but without all the camp of the TV series.  Helmed by director Tim Burton, and starring Michael Keaton (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Kim Basinger (Vicki Vale), and Jack Nicholson (Jack Napier/Joker), \\"Batman\\" gave the caped crusader the proper treatment he deserved.  Gone was the camp, and in was the dark, brooding, and vengeful billionare Bruce Wayne who prowls the rooftops of Gotham City in the guise of Batman, stopping evil wherever it may reside.  With huge critical and commercial success, it was official that Batman was a hot commodity and that a franchise was born.  The thing about this franchise is that Warner Brothers established the movie version of Batman, at least initially, as a brooding hero, as he has always been depicted in the comics.  However, over the span of the four movies that comprise the original `Batman' franchise, the hero went from brooding and dark to light, family fun and camp, much like the old TV show.  Though I have problems with the direction this franchise took, I must admit I still enjoy watching the movies, even my least favorite installment, \\"Batman & Robin\\" (the 4th film in the franchise).  Even with the decline of the franchise with the last installment, it is still one of the most successful film franchises of all time, and with the release of \\"Batman Begins\\", it appears that a new franchise has begun for the Dark Knight.  Now that I've given the history lesson for the day, it's time to move on to the plot synopsis' for each of the 4 movies, and my review for \\"Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology\\" collection. <br /> <br />\\"Batman\\" was basically the origin story for Bruce Wayne/Batman (Michael Keaton), but also served as the origin for Batman's greatest villain the Joker (Jack Nicholson).  Unlike most origin films where it takes forever for the hero to take on the role he is destined for, and we see the hero's progression in chronological order, director Tim Burton chose to start the movie out with Bruce Wayne already in the role of Batman.  The origins of Batman are shown in flashbacks, however the origin for the Joker is not handled in flashbacks, but rather as a plot point in the film's basic plot.  An interesting approach on the part of Tim Burton was to have Batman not be instantly trusted by Gotham City, and have the citizens and law enforcement in the city be torn over who they should trust, the dark and brooding, mysterious hero Batman, or the fun-loving, camera-friendly Joker.  Can Batman overcome the mistrust of the citizen's of Gotham City and stop the Joker's insidious plot before it's too late, or will he and his beloved city fall prey to the self-proclaimed `Clown Prince of Crime'? <br /> <br />\\"Batman Returns\\" picks up sometime after the events of \\"Batman\\", Gotham City survived the evil of the maniacal Joker, and Batman (Michael Keaton) has earned Gotham City's trust as their protector against the forces of evil.  But, as the Christmas season approaches in Gotham City, a crazed group of psychotic circus characters begins to terrorize Gotham, but as Batman is battling to protect Gotham City, a seemingly new hero emerges, who goes by the name of Penguin (Danny DeVito).  The crazy circus and this new `hero', the Penguin, aren't the only concerns for Batman, as he begins a new relationship with a woman named Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer).  However, a peaceful, loving relationship is not for Bruce Wayne, as Selina is not exactly what she seems, she is also the thief who goes by the name Catwoman.  As if all of these problems weren't enough, the Penguin turns out to be evil, and is leading the crazed circus group, and Catwoman joins forces with him to bring down the Dark Knight by framing him for murder, so that they may rule Gotham City.  <br /> <br />\\"Batman Forever\\" begins to show the signs of the `Batman' franchise changing direction from the darker tone of \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\", and into more lighter, family friendly territory.  The story picks up in what appears to be several years after the events of the first 2 films in the franchise, and Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer taking over for Michael Keaton) is being plagued by nightmares of his parent's deaths.  But the nightmares are starting to manifest themselves while he is awake, which causes him to seek the aid of a psychiatrist named Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), who just so happens to be fascinated by Batman, who unknown to her is the alter-ego of her newest patient.  As Bruce Wayne tries to push the nightmares away, the villainous Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and his gang are ransacking Gotham City's banks and jewelry stores.  At the same time a former Wayne Enterprises employee named Edward Nigma (Jim Carrey) has become obsessed with murdering his former boss Bruce Wayne, but not before tormenting him with mind games as the Riddler.  Separately Two-Face and the Riddler are threatening enough, but the stakes are raised when the two join forces in an attempt to take over the minds of Gotham City's citizens. <br /> <br />\\"Batman & Robin\\", the second `Batman' film to be directed by Joel Shumacher (\\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"A Time to Kill\\"), marks the end of the first `Batman' franchise and serves as the prime reason why there was an 8 year span where Batman was absent from the big screen.  This film finds Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) joining forces to fight the evil of Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), and her bodyguard Bane.  As if three villains weren't enough for the dynamic duo to contend with, they learn that Alfred (Michael Gough) is dying of a rare disease with no cure.  To stop these three villains, while at the same time trying to save Alfred, two heroes will not be enough; enter the newest member to the `bat-family', Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone).  To save Gotham City this battered and broken trio of heroes must rise up, put their differences aside, and show that nothing is stronger than the bonds of a family. <br /> <br />As one of the most successful movie franchises that helped resurrect the comic-book movie genre and almost kill it over the span of 4 movies, it serves as prime example of both how to and how not to make a franchise.  With the first 3 films, Warner Brothers showed that they knew how to handle a gigantic superhero franchise, but just like how Warner Brothers managed to destroy the `Superman' franchise, it wasn't long before a couple of stupid decisions would bury the `Batman' franchise as well.  The first 2 films directed by Tim Burton, \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" kept the darker tone of the comics intact and delivered fairly accurate representations of what Batman is all about.  The 3rd installment in the franchise, \\"Batman Forever\\" directed by Joel Shumacher and featuring Val Kilmer as Batman and introducing a new interpretation of Robin to moviegoers, began to show signs of trouble for this franchise.  As the darker tones and more realistic landscapes were slowly being replaced by more comedy and outlandish set pieces, and not to mention the problem of nipples on the batsuit.  Even with these foreboding signs, \\"Batman Forever\\" was still a terrific entry into the franchise, but with the 4th film, \\"Batman & Robin\\", Warner Brothers allowed Joel Shumacher too much freedom and the franchise suffered because of it.  It didn't help matters that casting was another problem with \\"Batman & Robin\\" with George Clooney filling the batsuit and Arnold Schwarzenegger portraying Mr. Freeze.  Clooney wasn't a bad Batman, but it would have been nice to see Val Kilmer stick around for more than just one film, although truth be told, Michael Keaton should have stayed through the entire franchise.  But Arnold Schwarzenegger should have never been cast as Mr. Freeze, in the comics Mr. Freeze was a skinny, scienctist who dabbled in suspended animation in hopes of curing his dying wife Nora of a rare disease, Arnold just did not fit the part.  However, even with my gripes regarding \\"Batman & Robin\\" there were several good things about the movie, the addition of Batgirl was a nice touch, although she was the daughter of Commissioner Gordon in the comics, not Alfred's niece, and having Alfred dying of the same rare disease as Mr. Freeze's wife was a nice twist. <br /> <br />Overall, though the franchise took a bad turn at the end, the series as a whole is enjoyable, and thanks to the huge success of \\"Batman Begins\\" a new `Batman' franchise is born, and the original franchise finally gets the DVD treatment it deserves with 2-disc special editions, jam-packed with extras for all of the fans out there.  Hopefully, Warner Brothers will be more successful with this new `Batman' franchise. <br />  <br />\\"Batman\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality. <br />\\"Batman Returns\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language. <br />\\"Batman Forever\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality. <br />\\"Batman & Robin\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B000007S5B|5.0|'Waiting For The Sun' has been given a bad rap by critics because for some reason its looked upon as a over commercialized recording with uninnovative filler tracks. Truth is, its a brilliant 'Summer' album which reveals the band breaking away from the format of previous albums and treading into more interesting territory.  This album is anything but boring.  'Hello, I Love You' the radio hit of this album may seem to prove the critics right at first glance, but tracks like 'Love Street', 'Summers Almost Gone' and 'My Wild Wild'(Those nasty filler tracks) push the band into more of a serious territory (Creatively). The album also has those legendary killer tracks as it becomes more obvious Morrison has traded psychadelics for booze in 'Five To One', the poetically brilliant 'Unknown Soldier' and (My personal favorite Doors song of all time) 'No To Touch The Earth'.  Morrison wasn't sinking creatively like critics said he was. Just because their back catalog of post pre-fame songs had expired,in no way meant or indicated Morrison was falling from grace. Morrison  introduced 'Feast Of Friends'(Live on stage) an innovative epic poem from which 'Not To Touch The Earth' is taken from. Unlike the other albums before this one, \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" has more of a feel to it, with a different edge, but an edge that improved the bands sound.
B0009S3HI0|3.0|Given all the time the Deftones had to put together this b-sides compilation it's a shame they couldn't get it right.  It just doesn't rock like a Deftones CD should.  It's missing some very key tracks.  Where are the likes of \\"Can't Even Breathe\\", the scathing \\"Teething\\", or the phenomenal \\"Lovers\\".  Also missing are the Depeche Mode covers \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" and the fan-favorite \\"To Have and To Hold\\", as well as another Duran Duran cover of \\"Nightboat\\" and S.O.D.'s \\"I Want Milk\\".  Whats here is a messy mix of a couple diamonds, a lot of rough, and some very questionable inclusions.<br /><br />It's not all bad.  The highlights include covers of \\"Simple Man\\", Helmet's \\"Sinatra\\", and The Smith's \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\", the latter being one of my favorite Deftones' tracks of all time.  As far as I know this is the first time \\"Simple Man\\" has been released to the public.  Also making their very first appearances on this record are \\"Wax and Wane\\", \\"Teenager (idiot version)\\", \\"Black Moon\\" (which is more of a Cypress Hill song), and a live version of \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\".  These new inclusions are very disappointing for this long time Deftones fan.  \\"Wax and Wane\\" is a unreleased b-side cover of a Cocteau Twins song and was made specifically for this record.  It's just a very flat rendition, nothing extraordinary.  \\"Teenager\\" (which is considered one of the weaker songs off of White Pony) is made a tad weaker with Chino teaming up with essentially a cover band called Idiot Pilot.  \\"Black Moon\\" was supposed to be on White Pony and thankfully it never was.  It just sounds straight out of a Cypress Hill record with B.Real doing most of the lyrics.  It's not bad per se, but it doesn't fit anything in the Deftones catalog.<br /><br />Other than those tracks you get acoustic versions of a few of the Deftones more popular singles.  These include \\"Change\\", \\"Digital Bath\\" and \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\".  While these were all solid acoustic sessions, and semi-popular with Deftones fans, they just add to the whole melancholy atmosphere of the record instead of picking up where those poorer tracks slowed the record down.  I'm not asking for a record of the most brutal and loud Deftones b-sides, but I don't expect any type of Deftones record to be this slow and monotonous.  I found myself going back and just listening to \\"Simple Man\\" and \\"Please, Please...\\" really the only two standouts.  Another question, why haven't the Deftones released (or maybe the question should be 'been able to release') some of their old demos.  Including remastered versions of \\"Linus\\", \\"Freaks\\", \\"Some People\\", and \\"God's Hands\\" would be a goldmine waiting to happen.  The Deftones fans love the old demos and a CD compilation of them all would sell like hot cakes.<br /><br />I give the CD version a 2/5 for a poor track layout, a lot of well-deserved missing tracks.  It would have worked better as a 2-discer (or 3, if you include the DVD).  That said, if your a completist, your probably going to get this no matter what (I did).  If your new to the Deftones and you see this new album, don't buy it, buy any of their previous albums first.  This is really for the die-hards (who may die harder because of this, heh).<br /><br />Thankfully the DVD included makes the $20 spent on this mostly worthwhile.  FINALLY all the Deftones music videos are available all on one DVD.  I can't give it more than a 4/5 because it is basically a bare bones music video DVD.  No real extras (except an \\"extra\\" un released video of \\"Root\\").  No concert footage (except for a few seconds here and there interspersed between videos).  It's a nice presentation when you watch all the videos back to back though, each video and the footage between each flow seamlessly, and it makes for a very professional look.<br /><br />Again, I recommend this CD only if your a huge Deftones fan/completist or are desperately looking for a way to have all their music videos on one DVD.  Please don't buy this CD as an introduction to the Deftones.<br /><br />SCORES:<br /><br />CD (2/5)<br /><br />DVD (4/5)<br /><br />TOTAL (3/5)os on one DVD.  Please don't buy this CD as an introduction to the Deftones. <br /> <br />SCORES: <br />CD (2/5) <br />DVD (4/5) <br />TOTAL (3/5)
B000002I2I|4.0|The Doors desperately needed to prove their worth after the 'Bad Egg' of their previous album (The Soft Parade) and the calamity of the infamous 'Miami Incident'.  'Morrison Hotel' rocks! It certainly is an album worthy of the bands legacy that may have been shattered after previous letdowns.  Morrison rocks the blues, and even reminisces with sounds similiar to ther bands debut album with songs like 'Indian Summer' and 'Queen Of The Highway'. 'Roadhouse Blues' the opening track was a wise choice to kick off the album, hooking the listener instantly. Its a great album and fun to listen to!
B0000033TE|5.0|Yes. I mean that. This LP, now on CD, is one of the 5 best by any progressive band on either side of the Atlantic. \\"KARN EVIL 9\\" is one of the most powerful concept works of the height of the progressive movement. \\"TOCCATA\\" a truly classical work interpreted here by Keith and his screaming eagle keyboard work. Greg's \\"STILL...YOU TURN ME ON\\" is one of his best ballads since \\"Lucky Man\\". \\"BENNY THE BOUNCER\\" proves that prog rockers can throw a sense of humor in with all the pomp and imagery. Heavily keyboard driven, this LP had guitar virtuosos scratching their heads. But no one can deny that this work is a masterpiece. ELP's all time best. It's everything a progressive LP should be. Music is many things to many people, but prog rock enthusiasts love music that begs to be LISTENED TO. This LP definately falls into that catagory. It is sure to provoke some dazzling mental imagery. A Classic.
B000002I2G|3.0|Unlike all the other Doors albums I've listened to, I struggled through 'The Soft Parade'. With previous albums, I listened to them straight through in one sitting over and over again for weeks. When I put the 'Soft Parade' album on I found myself sampling a few minutes of each song, then skipping quickly to the next until a song I felt was decent came on to listen all the way through (And there wasn't too many of these on this album).  Of course weeks later after 'Warming Up' to the album I was able to listen to it all in one sitting.  I certainly enjoyed the album, but It was not a good album for 'The Doors'. As an entire entity 'The Soft Parade' in no way shape or form sounds like any of the bands recorded material previous to it and after it.  Sure, there are a few tracks that are certainly identifiable with the bands sound, but too few and far between unfortunately. If the Doors were experimenting with this album, they really goofed!
B000A6T1JU|2.0|Why in the Hell did Walter Hill decided to add those stupid comic book like scenes and cut some very cool scenes? According to him, he wanted to make sure that people knew like this was some kind of fantasy-type film, like we didn't know that. <br /> <br />The Warriors is a masterpiece, and this is a director's vut alright, he cut the good stuff and added crappy comic book sh_t. At least they should've added 2 edtions of the film on this DVD, the theatrical release and the butchered director's cut. <br /> <br />I do like the way they remastered the footage, looks very updated. The special features are good, too. However, many fans of this film including myself are gonna be mad about how Walter Hill destroyed his own film on DVD. <br /> <br />No wonder he hasn't had a hit in years, he must be brain dead.
B000002H92|3.0|\\"In Concert\\" is unique because it really is one of the few genuine live albums of its time. Apart from the obsessive editing done on the album, there are no studio touch ups by the band on this record. What you hear is all live material from the concerts. The albums certainly has it moments, but I find just when things are getting interesting, suddenly you feel your pulled away from it by some track that just doesn't seem like it fits in the sequence. I will credit the album to this however: You will not find a better recorded version of 'Not To Touch The Earth' anywhere (Including its origional studio track on 'Waiting For The Sun') or the 'Dead Cats/Dead Rats-Break On Through' medley.
B000AA305M|1.0|This is a wonderful record, as others have said.  Five stars for the music.  But it's COPY PROTECTED!  You can't use it. <br /> <br />When you try to copy this disc onto your computer, the first thing you'll see is a Legal Agreement window, saying that you can copy the disc twice, and if you try to copy it again you're subject to being arrested.  Arrested!!  I mean!!  I PAID for this disc.  I live in the 21st century, so I put my music on my computer, then I back it up to discs, then I buy new computers, and take the music in the car on CD's, etc.  I need to make multiple copies -- but according to the people at Sony I'll be *arrested* if I do!!!   <br /> <br />Next you're asked to agree to this threat, this impediment on your use of the music you PAID for.  If you say no, the disc ejects.  The end.  Well, almost.  In my case the copy-protection software crashed my computer and I had to hunt for it and delete it.  It's essentially a virus that demands to be installed. <br /> <br />If you agree to the restrictions on your listening to the music that you PAID for, an awful program called MediaMax installs itself on your computer, whether you like it or not.  You CANNOT play this CD with iTunes, MusicMatch, Windows Media Player or any other computer software.  You can ONLY play it with MediaMax.  You cannot index it with your other records, you cannot mix the tunes onto your playlist.  You basically can't use it. <br /> <br />I'm sorry, but I say NO!  Sony will NOT intimidate and cheat me in this way.  Lest you get sentimental over their BS about \\"supporting the artist,\\" you should know that the average musical act gets somewhere between 16 and 25 cents - cents, as in pennies - from the sixteen dollars that you paid for the disc.  Only the very top names get any more..  If you really want to support an artist, go see them in concert, because the way they make any real money is from ticket sales on tour.  I saw David Gray last night at Radio City in New York, and he wasfabulous!  I loved the concert, and felt good about supporting him. <br /> <br />To reclaim my consumer rights to the entertainment I legally purchased - PAID for - I copied the disc using an audio copy, soundcard to soundcard, to eliminate copy protection.. This will defeat ANY copy protected disc.  If you can hear it, you can record it.  It's easy, anyone can do it, and you'll have an unprotected original that you can copy as many times as you want, or load it into your iTunes, iPod, MusicMatch or whichever jukebox you like.   <br /> <br />Here's how:  First, you'll need an audio editing program.  I use Adobe Audition, which is great but pricey.  There are lots of free and shareware audio programs out there, at places like Tucows and Shareware dot com.  Get one; they're useful for clipping excess applause, talking between songs, etc.  Take a CD player, plug the audio or auxiliary output into your computer's soundcard input, play the CD and record it on your computer with the sound editing program.  Copy protection has no effect on this.  It's very simple, really easy.  If you use a good CD player and your computer has a good sound card (about $50) the sound will be *indistinguishable* from the original.  *Perfectly* clear!  No deterioration.  Or you can use a second computer, which I do, and plug the output of one soundcard to the input of the other.  After the CD is recorded, split the album into song tracks in the sound editor program by cutting and pasting each song one at a time into a new music file - again, very easy - and save each music file with the name of each song.  It takes less than a minute per track.  Save the tracks as \\"WAV\\" files, which are highest quality.  Do not use MP3 here; that's important!  Later you can convert to MP3 if you like.  Finally, load the tracks into your jukebox - I use MusicMatch - and assign track numbers and the album title.  Another 2 minutes.  Total time 12 to 13 minutes once you're familiar with the process.  I now havethe music on three computers and I made several CD's of it.  The copies sound perfect, crystal clear, master quality - and they're not copy protected.  And they shouldn't be!!! <br /> <br />Tell all your friends not to be be suckered into PAYING for the crippled, damaged goods Sony is foisting on us.  If enough people do that, it'll be like a grassroots rebellion.  The morons at Sony might get the message.  They're screwing up their business so badly that they just laid off 10,000 people.  Brilliant maneuvers like cutting their own throats by harassing, intimidating and threatening their own PAYING customers is one reason.  If they keep up the KGB-like copy protection, they'll lose even more.   <br /> <br />Grrrrrr!  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it any more!  And you don't have to, either. <br />
B0007IN318|5.0|This novel is great historical fiction and one of the most entertaining books I've read in awhile.  While we all know what is going to happen -- Vesuvius is going to blow and bury Pompeii -- Harris creates tremendous suspense as his fictional mystery plot weaves through the historical catastrophe.  Harris gives us a seemingly realistic and charming portrait of the most famous casualty of the eruption -- the Roman statesman, soldier and (best known to history) scholar Pliny the Elder.  Harris also creates a fully realized protagonist that the reader will care about from the first chapter.  Marcus Attilius Primus -- a water engineer or \\"aquarius\\" -- is a great character through whom we learn a lot about Roman aqueducts, marvellous feats of engineering that have always left me to wonder, \\"How'd they do that?\\"  Rather than answer that question with a dry exposition on Roman hydraulic engineering, this novel provides a flesh-and-blood answer through Attilius, as we watch him sleuth out the parallel mysteries of why an aqueduct stopped flowing and why his predecessor as aquarius suddenly disappeared.   <br /> <br />If you are interested in Roman history, this novel is a must-read.  \\"Pompeii\\" is not as moody or brilliant as Marguerite Yourcenar's \\"Memoirs of Hadrian,\\" but is worthy of addition to any short list of great novels set during the Roman Empire.  This novel is set in the same generation as that of Lindsey Davis' entertaining Marcus Didius Falco mysteries, and Harris' novel is far better.  If you are not into Roman history, you will still enjoy this novel for its characters, mystery plot, and vivid descriptions of a famous natural disaster.   <br />
B00005JODA|5.0|While I was visiting my fiancee in Berkeley, we had an opportunity to go see The Constant Gardener. starring Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz (amongst others in a fine cast), this movie has fine performances, great cinematography, and an engaging and troubling story.<br /><br />The story: a mild-mannered British diplomat meets a fiery, passionate woman. They quickly fall in love, and marry, and then get posted to Africa. She's a crusader, and dies on her crusade, and he sets out in quest, to unravel the mysteries of her murder and her crusade.<br /><br />Both Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz turn in fine performances. RW easily turns in the best performance of her career--very touching, especially with that smile and laugh--and I could see a nomination or two coming her way.<br /><br />The plot is tight and believable. I won't spoil the story, but let's just say I found it disturbing mostly because I found it all too plausible.<br /><br />I have to highly recommend this film.
B00000099Y|5.0|I'm a pretty bad game/music cd reviewer so I'm just gonna make this short...I liked Undertow...Alot...but I simply LOVE Aenema, it's probably one of my favorite albums of all time, all the sounds are just incredibly dark and soooooooo good, the lyrics are dark and the music/beats are just brilliant, I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND I LOVE TOOL..  <br /> <br />Best tracks are hands down Stinkfist,H., Eulogy, 46 and 2(the best song in the album), Aenema, Jimmy <br /> <br />5/5 stars
B000000YIQ|5.0|Believe it or not, this reviewer has been a Jazz fan for years and surprisingly had never heard anything by Sonny Rollins until this week with the purchase of \\"Way Out West\\". I must say that listening to this album was like unlocking a door to a mansion (like my discovering of John Coltrane was) and there definitely will be more Sonny albums making their way to my collection soon.<br /><br />With that out of the way, onto the music itself: \\"Way Out West\\" was recorded in 1957 and finds Rollins playing in a piano-less trio backed only by bassist Ray Brown and drummer Shelly Manne. The liner notes to the album state that the three musicians hadn't played together before until this recording session. You'd never know it by listening to this album though. Rollins, Brown and Manne play off each other effortlessly and are like six hands in a glove. It's as if they'd played together for years.<br /><br />On the upbeat tracks, \\"I'm an Old Cowhand\\", \\"Come Gone\\" and the title track, Rollins and his trio really swing and leave plenty of space for improvisation and soloing. \\"Come Gone\\" is an especially prime example of this.<br /><br />The same can be said for the slower ballad-oriented pieces. Sonny's take on Duke Ellington's \\"Solitude\\" is superb and soothing and is a real standout. \\"Wagon Wheels\\", while not neccesarily a ballad, is also a standout with its mid-tempo blues-like runs.<br /><br />Besides the original tracks that made up the album, there are also three alternate takes tacked on as bonus tracks. The alternate version of \\"I'm An Old Cowhand\\" is arguably stronger than its master take and is also twice as long running at 10 minutes rather than five and a half. The alternates of \\"Come Gone\\" and the title track are performed in such a way that they almost become different pieces of music altogether. Rollins solo in the alternate \\"Come Gone\\" is more raspy and edgy which gives the impression that this take was recorded live in a club rather than a studio. It's fabulous too.<br /><br />With that said, \\"Way Out West\\" is an excellent first choice for the emerging Sonny Rollins fan. The playing is excellent and the musicianship is flawless. The only minor complaint is that the bonus alternate takes are presented on the CD after their master take counterparts (example: The master take of I'm An Old Cowhand is immediately followed by its alternate take as is \\"Come, Gone\\" and \\"Way Out West\\"). They should have been sequenced at the end of the disc following the original album tracks. Apart from that, who really cares? This is a great album with great music on it.<br /><br />Essential!!t said, \\"Way Out West\\" is an excellent first choice for the emerging Sonny Rollins fan.

B000066NW0|4.0|2002's skater chick-angst hit \\"Complicated\\" is a decent song, but like every other track on Avril Lavigne's debut Let Go, this popular single remains too childish for most people post-high school graduation to enjoy (a prime example is \\"Sk8tr Boi,\\" a catchy tune that's lyrics, a la Avril, sound like a Dear Diary entry).  Unlike her contemporaries Jewel and Vanessa Carlton, Lavigne's lyrics often sound like something you might find scrolled in a yearbook rather than something that is truly deep and meaningful; that said, of course tween girls and rebellious teens will love her.  The fan-professed \\"anti-Britney Spears,\\" this girl has an interesting voice, but her live performances are often lackluster by far (did anyone hear her at the Grammy's in 2003?!).  Still, Let Go does in fact pack many listenable pieces of ear candy, mainly thanks to Canadian production team The Matrix who provide the music to every song on Lavigne's semi-stellar debut.  Consistent?  Yes.  Pissy?  Oh yeah!...but the one thing that Lavigne seems to lack for crowds legally old enough to vote and drink is charisma; but knowing Miss Lavigne she doesn't give a crap!
B000002L9M|5.0|Black Celebration may be one of the finest albums constructed in the past 25 years.  This is a pensive, complex music by Depeche Mode that sounds much more developed than their later more popular works (e.g. Violator).  The individual tracks are mellifluous, often blending from one to the other. As such, \\"Black Celebration\\"functions much more as an actual album than as a vehicle for radio singles as many current CDs do.  The vocals are plaintively voiced, and while the synthesizers are utilzed to great potential on every track, the album has a host of still moments and quiet beauty.  Consider the transition from the passionate yet not overdone single \\"A Question of Lust--\\" which is fluidly nested in the album-- to the distant, wistful \\"Sometimes.\\"  However the energy that popularized Depeche Mode's later singles is not absent on this album, and the title track \\"Black Celebration\\" and \\"A Question of Time\\" abound with hypnotic rhythms and driving synth beat. The otherworldly, complex synthesized music has a transportive quality which is ideal for those that use music as an escapist tool.  In all, for the fans of 80s New Wave, synth pop, or even passionately orchestrated classical music this is a brilliant choice.
B000002WPI|5.0|I must review this album once a month, but whatever, it's that amazing. it's my favorite of all time from any genre, and I listen to nearly all music out there. hip-hop, classic rock, alternative rock, some metal, hell even sometimes I listen to jazz radio in my car on satellite radio, but this album tops all other music in existence. <br /> <br />12 cuts, one of which is a remix, and every last one is just perfect. I could write for days how the wu-tang clan is the best idea in hip-hop, with 9 members who change up who appears on each track (and always have 1 group track on every album) so that the lyrics and voices never get tired, and how the rza is one of the best producers ever (just behind dj premier and dr. dre), but I won't. I'll just simply say this is the best piece of music ever published. <br /> <br />I have this thing memorized from beginning to end, and I'm considering playing it backwards a few times so I can learn it that way too. it's just that damn good. a must own for anyone who likes music.
B000001GGV|1.0|The greatest moment of all, was K380 and the excellent ritenuti he did right before he starts! That is exactly what the style of Scarlatti is! Good job, and great musical understanding! oh do I love those people!!!!!! (actually it was BAD, very bad)
B000002WYW|4.0|its 1997, and the wu-tang clan has had 6 classic albums (36 chambers, tical, liquid swords, return to the 36 chambers, only built 4 cuban linx, ironman), almost all with huge commercial success. how do you turn that into a 7th hit? make a double album backed with a banging #1 single. it obviously worked since the ablum went gold in the first week alone. but that commercial success is when the wu started losing some of their original touch. 36 chambers had 12 perfect tracks and fans only wanted more, but when 26 tracks come out at once there have to be some fillers alongside the classics (...).    all fillers ignored, however, this album is just killer. triumph, the #1 hit single features every member (odb only doing the intro tho). reunited, the street single, is my personal favorite on the album. rza innovates a little with violin loops instead of his usual keys and it turns out to be dope. odb and gza drop some of the best verses on the album on that song. gza and raekwon also kill on severe punishment with some funny kung-fu samples, and rza's production is top notch on songs like heaterz. deadly melody showcases masta killa's haunting rhyming skill over rza's usual eerie piano loops with tight verses from meth and ghostface too. as high as wu-tang gets is another one of the standout tracks, with meth and gza (probably the best wu members to work together as seen on shadowboxin' from liquid swords) rhyming over a funky rza beat with a dope bassline and a fun singing chorus from odb.    overall this album is one of the best from the 90s and an excellent sophomore attempt from the whole clan, not innovating too much but still offering something different from their first album. unfortunately their next 2 albums almost completely ditch the old wu-tang style and now they're just above-average rappers instead of the supergroup they once were.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Well done. Holds the interest of those who could care less about \\"Batman\\". We could use more of this.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|The original power rock trio Cream reunited for the first time in thirty-seven years for a string of concerts at the place they played their last shows, Royal Albert Hall.  Anyone expecting the band to be as fierce and experimental as they were then is just unfair.  Most acts mellow with age and lose their youthful aggression.  Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce & Ginger Baker are no different.  Despite this, the band is quite tight on the album.  There aren't the lengthy jams of the old days, but that is made up for by sharper and more focused playing.  Mr. Bruce's bass is still quite heavy and although he can't hit all the high notes, his voice is still fluid. Mr. Clapton doesn't cut loose as much, but his phrasing and styling is impeccable.  Mr. Baker's drumming is less erratic and adds a more solid backbeat.  All the favorites like \\"Crossroads\\", \\"White Room\\", \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\", \\"I'm So Glad\\" and \\"Spoonful\\" are included as well as some nuggets like \\"Pressed Rat & Warthog\\", \\"Deserted Cities Of The Heart\\" and \\"Badge\\".
B000AARKOO|4.0|Yeah, little heat in romance but this is a war epic. Worth the viewing.
B000AL730O|5.0|I'm a huge Beatles Fan.  Yes, aren't we all? (You better be if you are possibly thinking about purchasing Paul's music!)   <br /> <br />Driving Rain, released in 2001, was, in my opinion, not his best work at all.  In fact, the album was pretty bad.  I tend to hear it, like some songs, but forget it, and I haven't listened to it in years now.  <br /> <br />Chaos and Creation is a different album.  It sounds almost like a Beatles album.  Yup, Its like hearing Paul sing in the 60's, particularly in 1968.   <br /> <br />The songs that got me were Jenny Wren, English Tea, Fine Line, and At The Mercy.  <br /> <br />Jenny Wren is like the 2005 \\"Blackbird\\".  Its so melodic and soothing.  Its a standout track.  <br /> <br />English Tea sounds like something he would have written in 1967 with Sgt Peppers.  It uses the recorder and sounds VERY Beatles.  I love it to death. <br /> <br />A Fine Line is probably the standout track of the album.  Its one of the more upbeat songs on the album, and its very poppy.  Something that Paul would have definately written.  <br /> <br />At The Mercy reminds me of Wings material.  I like the song strangely, and its very eerie.  I keep listening to it, and it just gets better.   <br /> <br />Other favs are Friends to Go, Too Much Rain, and Riding to Vanity Fair.  \\"This Never Happened Before\\" is one of my fave's too:  very soothing, beautiful song to hear.  <br /> <br />Why should you buy this CD??  Great question, and these are the reasons why: <br /> <br />1) If you love the Beatles, you'll hear a lot of familiar beatle sounds. Tons of strings and stuff.  <br /> <br />2) 13 tracks, with some hidden tracks after 13.  Yup, extra material! <br /> <br />3) This album Will not catch your attention when you first hear it completely!  You have to listen to it over and over, and it just grows on you.  I love albums that grow, and not the other way, sorta like his last album \\"Driving Rain\\".  <br /> <br />4) This is not a typical Paul McCartney album.  More melancholy and soothing instead of poppy ballady type of songs.  Its a slight change.  <br /> <br />5) Vocals are smoother i believe on this album.  <br /> <br />6) The artwork inside the cover is weird:  drawings of himself.  I swear, one picture looks like he shot a bird!  <br /> <br />Ok, I hope you get the album.  Its really really good.  Sorry to all who dislike it, but its one of the better albums to come out this year.  <br /> <br />

B000083E79|5.0|This album spans one of the longest carriers in music history and it is Cher's. The lady's been here since 1962. That's 43 years. Unbelievable. Even if some don't recognize the quality of her work they should respect the sheer power and impact of these 43 years.    This collection is at least the 10th best of collection of Cher but this time the collection is almost complete. The CD was released during her Farewell Tour and consists mostly of songs performed on the tour. Even though I can't understand why the US edition contains only 1 CD and the European one (which I have) 2 CD's, this is the best \\"best of\\" that can be ordered in the US.    We can track the lady's career from her first real hit, All I Really Want To Do till the hits and well deserved success of her last two albums (Believe, Song For The Lonely and Strong Enough). What we have in between is quite mixed. No Cher collection is complete without If I Could Turn Back Time and the absolute winner, Heart Of Stone (which as she said she likes the best of all her songs). Another must is I've Got You Babe with Sonny. We have the disco era (Take Me Home), the classic kitsch hit Dark Lady and her first efforts alone, Half-Breed and Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves (kitsch hits, too). The rest is also pretty good material, containing all her major hits, although A Different Kind Of Love Song could have been replaced by The Way Of Love.    The former best of collections always focused on one of these eras and were always full with those songs and the old ones were never properly represented. This time, however, as George Lucas says the saga is complete. I can only hope that she will come back once again (as she did always) and this collection which heralded her last goodbye will be \\"just another\\" farewell album. Nevertheless, until her next comeback, this is the ultimate collection of her work.
B00008OWZC|5.0|A must have album for all Zep fans. Rockin compilation edited by Jimmy Page from 1972 performances. Gotta be one of the best live rock performances (of any band on the planet) ever recorded. Supernatural Page riffs fueled by the awesome talents of Bonzo, Plant, and John Paul Jones. This recording is THE definition of heavy rock. All the tracks are fantastic but especially this version of Stairway to Heaven. Jones' bass work throughout is not to be believed!!!
0375758992|5.0|The narrator of this memoir is like a character in a great novel. Her version of survivng a life in Africa with parents who are maddening at times and seemingly eccentric, is one to savor for its great details of another world and descriptions of their day to day struggles. Reading this memoir will make you hungry for more.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I've got to go along with the people who liked Napolean Dynamite.  John Heder depicts perfectly the nerdy high school male who is disaffected in virtually every area of life.  Even when his date skips out on him at the high school dance he could give a rat's ass.  Even when he gets pounded up against his school locker by hallway goons, big deal.  He just brushes himself off and goes about his nerdy way.  Pedro is great too, as are most of the cast.  The sleazy uncle is terrific, a loser always on the make trying to recapture past glory that was never really there to begin with.  And the older brother's online romance, and finally meeting his virtual sweetheart--a dominating black female about twice his size--is, well, just great. <br /> <br />Okay, so a universe has been created and we get to observe its characters for awhile.  And it works for the most part.  The only reason I didn't give Napolean Dynamite five stars is because of the awkward and abrupt ending.  It just seemed like the director didn't know how to wrap it up.  Maybe that's consistent with the nature of this film, a parody through and through.
0060825219|4.0|I've been a big fan of Coelho and have read most of his previous books. Those who enjoyed \\"The Alchemist\\" may find \\"The Zahir\\" a bit shallow. There is really no story line and very few life lessons to learn and ponder after reading it. I would say the content is exclusively for adults, similar to \\"Eleven Minutes\\", and less like \\"The Alchemist\\" which even a young person can enjoy. <br /> <br />The book is not about the search for his wife Esther or his struggle with \\"The Zahir.\\" I think it is about married adult life and its turmoils. Do we still know and love the person we married 10-15 years ago? Is infidelity acceptable once marriage falls apart? Do money and success bring happiness? etc. etc. <br /> <br />At times his writing is superficial when he mocks his critics and the \\"establishment\\" but if you can get pass by that nonsense, he does explore some heavy stuff for which he gives vague but insightful answers. It's not an easy fairy tale like \\"The Alchemist.\\"
B000AYEIZY|3.0|When I heard Cream was finally reuniting I was ecstatic. I was like a kid in a candy shop when I read this cd was being released and promptly bought it on it's release date.  I was pretty disappointed in it's length, yes you get 2 discs but you feel like they put could've put everything on one disc or put more songs.  Overall the band sounds almost like they're going through the motions.  Clapton's guitar sounds flat and uninspiring.  He should have picked up a Gibson SG for these shows because a Strat just doesn't cut it. Jack's bass sounds pretty good, vocals sound aged.  Ginger's vocals on Pressed Rat... sound great but his drum solo on Toad just  seems lacking.  Certainly not what I was expecting from the World's first supergroup.
B0000508U6|5.0|A great variation of sounds and a good start for anyone interested in listening to a band such as Coldplay. The first song 'Don't Panic' is one of my favorites and is also on the Garden State soundtrack -which I suggest as well. The CD ends in a nice set of mellow songs, We Never Change and Everythings Not Lost are two great songs. If you have heard Coldplay just recently and what to get more into their music this CD is definately recommended.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This review may sound a bit harsh on another teen drama, however I'm a huge fan of both shows.<br /><br />The first season of Veronica Mars is what the second season of the OC wanted to be.  There is drama, romance, suspense, intrigue, and plot twists - the final episode caught me off guard, and I am never surprised at TV endings being a trained screenwriter myself.  If you're looking for a new guilty pleasure, or a show that parents and teens (no younger children, but teens should be OK) can watch together and understand at their respective levels, this one is it.<br /><br />I won't go into the plot as that as been covered extensively, however I will go into the use of foreshadowing.  The writers of Veronica Mars, who all deserve emmys for this, have used the art of foreshadowing in a completely new way for teen drama.  They have used subtle and dramatic foreshadowing to lead the viewer in several different directions with regard to the lily kane murder, allowing each viewer to feel they know exactly what happened before Veronica figures it out.  Of course, the viewer is wrong and could never figure out a mystery before Veronica does, but it really adds to the experience of the show.  You, like the students of Neptune High, get to experience the \\"zig when you should zag\\" feeling of not getting to the punch before the great Veronica Mars.<br /><br />The Lily Kane murder mystery ending is something that I hope no one has given away in reviews yet, as it's best experienced by watching the entire season to lead up to the ending.  If you do this, you'll never know what hit you.<br /><br />I would rate this a 10 if I could, and all other OC fans who think the OC is the best show on television - take a look at the OTHER rich kid high school drama out there.  ;)
B00006879E|3.0|Songs about Jane is a smooth and cool cd,if you want smooth rock that you can relax and enjoy, you can get it here. I dont regret purchasing this album. I admire the lyrics and rhythm they chose for each song. There are people out there that dont appreciate good, innocent music and cant give credit to the artist who created it. This is the only album I have heard from this group and have yet to listen to their newer ones and I am sure there are just as good or even better. I can compare them to matchbox 20 because of their soft, funky,rock style they play through  whole album. The two songs that caught my attention are Beauty queen and This Love. These songs have cool guitar riffs that they use alot through both songs. You can tell they use the guitar as their lead instrument through most of the album along with the piano as their second choice, that is why I like their  style. I also enjoy the way they utilize the guitar and make it blend in with the other instruments. This whole album is about  Jane, and the expressions about her through the artist eye view,in which some of us can relate to.When I want to kick back and relax at home or on the road, I just pop in this cd and flow with the rythm and listen to the lyrics. Its not too soft and not too hard, its just right.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is the album that started it all. Each and every song on here deserves to be a single, and it never gets old. Some of my favorites in no particular order are Longview (which has excellent basswork and drums), Welcome to Paradise, In the End, and F.O.D. I really like all of them, but if i had to choose, those would be it. Now that I've got that out of the way, I'm going to destroy \\"Megadeth fan\\"'s review. Those of you who have seen it will know what I'm talking about. First of all, his/her review lists a bunch of people they think could kick Billie Joe's butt, and unless they think that Green Day is a wrestling team instead of a band, WHO FREAKING CARES???? And for future reference, Tre Cool is the drummer, not Mike Dirnt, which is what they seemed to think. So if you're going to beat up on Green Day, you MIGHT want to know what you're talking about first. So buy it!!! You won't be sorry.
B000B0WODA|5.0|I loved them when they first released their CD, I loved them when they got 'popular,' and I love them now. This CD is only slightly less good than the original, and only because in the original they yelled in German and did other weird stuff like that. That's what hooked me on them. Unlike this CD, it had about half amazing tracks, and the others were just kind of 'eh.' This CD is fabulous, nothing Sophomore-slumpy about it. The songs that aren't GREAT are still very good. There are actually quite a few songs on here that I really, really like. <br /> <br />The Fallen: everyone likes this song, but this is one of my least favorites. The guitar riff is extremely catchy but there's just something that sounds 'wrong' with it. I can't put my finger on it. Overall this is a fine opener, but I already got sick of it. 7/10 <br /> <br />Do You Want To: this is a slightly irritating song. Catchy and fun, but it's fluffy. One of the least intelligent songs--so naturally, it's the first single. 6/10 <br /> <br />This Boy: Extremely catchy, fun, weird. Great intro riff, one of the not-deep songs off this album. Gets stuck in my head for hours at a time. 9/10 <br /> <br />Walk Away: I had this as a demo track way before the CD was released. The demo track was excellent, deep, and soulful--it's downloadable for free on Franz's website. This one is more melodious, more 'finished' sounding, and flows better. One of the more ballad-y songs on the CD, one of, if not my favorite, songs. This is a little slower but equally as catchy as the rest. 10/10 <br /> <br />Evil and a Heathen: what a strange song--Alex's voice is almost distorted through the verses, and the chorus is loud and fast. Almost doesn't sound like Franz at times. This is a song to either love or hate. 9/10 <br /> <br />You're the Reason I'm Leaving: this is what 'Cheating on You' should've been like, this shows that the band is more in touch with their style. A classic Franz style song with good music and good vocals.10/10 <br /> <br />Eleanor Put Your Boots On: it sounds like a Beatles song. The 'Eleanor' is not a coincidental name choice. A mellow, soft song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Well, That Was Easy: one of my favorites off the CD, and another one I had as a demo. This one was greatly improved since its demo days, flows better, sounds clearer, and has better music. Reminiscent of 'This Fire' in style. 10/10 <br /> <br />What You Meant: good riff, but loses strength later on in the song. It's still good, but not one of the best on the album. 7/10 <br /> <br />You Could Have It So Much Better: another song like The Fallen that everyone likes, as well as the namesake of the album. I like the name. I'm not in love with the song. It's good, but it will be overplayed quickly. 8/10 <br /> <br />Fade Together: this is going to be the intro of about a thousand movies. It's quieter, slow, and simple. The vocals are kind of breath-y and summery. One of the unique songs. 9/10. <br /> <br />Outsiders: a good closure to this CD, not a *remarkable* song but decent, catchy and very Franz-sounding. 8/10 <br /> <br />I'm biased, because I loved them before for all of their music--those who only liked Take Me Out might be disappointed by this. For those who liked most of the debut CD will like this. There is no stellar track (Dark of the Matinee... cough) on this one, but it's still really good, good enough that I'd actually purchase a whole CD for once.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|THE POSITIVE FACTS FIRST, IT'S ALWAYS FUN WATCHING ERIC CLAPTON BLAZE AWAY ON THE GUITAR AND HE CERTAINLY DOES THAT ON THIS DVD. JACK AND GINGER SOUND PRETTY GOOD ALSO. <br />NOW FOR THE NEGATIVE FACTS. FIRST, THE EDITING OF THIS DVD IS MARGIONAL AT BEST. WAY TOO MANY AUDIENCE SHOTS, FROM THE OTHER END OF THIS HUGE VENUE TO CLOSEUPS OF PLASTIC CUPS AND THE BACKS OF SPEAKERS. IT SEEMS AS IF EVERY TIME THE BAND REALLY STARTS SMOKIN', THE CAMERAS END UP SHOWING HALLWAY AUDIENCE SHOTS.SECONDLY, THE MUSIC IS VERY DATED EVEN THOUGH ITS PLAYED WELL. 35 YEARS AGO IT WAS CUTTING EDGE STUFF.NOW ITS JUST A FLASH FROM THE PAST.DID WE REALLY NEED A \\"CREAM\\" REUNION ? I SAW \\"CREAM\\" BACK IN THE DAY AND IT WAS MAGICIAL. NOW IT SEEMS AS IF THEY ARE JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS, TRYING TO RECAPTURE A MAGICAL MOMENT IN TIME. WELL, FOR ME, SOME MAGICAL MOMENTS CANNOT BE REDONE. LET IT REST, BOYS.....................       <br />
0740748475|5.0|received \\"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes\\" today, all 24lbs. of it according to UPS package. The set is beautiful and I am very satisfied with the look and feel of the paper and binding as well as the price. As for another reviewer's comment that it is not really a hardcover book, I cannot agree. It seems to be well bound despite the fact the pages are not sewn, but glued. I guess time will tell whether it is an inferior binding. The weight of the paper and quality is certainly better than \\"The Complete Far Side Collection\\".<br /><br />The set begins with an autobiographical introduction by Bill Watterson recounting his career in cartooning from beginnings in Chagrin Falls, Ohio and at Kenyon College. His early rejections and sudden success, as well as his refusal to forgo all merchandising are also briefly explained, as are his battles with the newspaper editors and syndicates over the half page Sunday cartoon formats. Even briefer is his description of his post-Calvin and Hobbes career that has been we learn spent at learning to paint. I would have liked a little more detail about his Calvin and Hobbes experience, but clearly it is up to us, the readers to decode this.<br /><br />The Collection of cartoons is wonderful. Long ago I lost or lent out my paperback books, so it's wonderful to have all the cartoons in one collection and to relive both my childhood with my own stuffed Tiger and the years 1985-1995 when I eagerly turned to Calvin and Hobbes in the Washington Post every morning before reading the News. What does it all mean? For me Calvin and Hobbes is a separate world, a sort of parallel universe, a mixture of the Comic Strip and my childhood memories combined into one. It made me realize years later that my early opinion that grown-ups are crazy was essentially true, but then I did not realize that until I was a grown-up myself. It's a pleasure to have this collection and I will savor reading it slowly. I recommend it highly. It's not just a cartoon about a boy and a Tiger, but much more. The wonderful thing is, that it's up to the reader to figure this out on their own.<br /><br />Review by Walter O. Koenigbout a boy and a Tiger, but much more. The wonderful thing is, that it's up to the reader to figure this out on their own. <br /> <br />Review by Walter O. Koenig
B0009S3HI0|4.0|In all fairness, yes it is missing some of the B Sides.  If you are a die hard Deftones fan, which is who this set is geared for, you probably have them already anyway. <br /> <br />Their versions of The Cure's \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\" and Sade's \\"No Ordinary Love\\" are haunting and incredible.  As far as the track list goes, I personally would have preferred a few cover songs other than alternate versions of White Pony tracks, but that's just me. <br /> <br />The packaging itself is superb, with tons of photos and liner notes, everything a collection such as this should be.
B00005JO0L|5.0|I loved the movie but was disappointed that 2 characters died.  I really hope to see another movie in the near future and/or even the series coming back to TV.  Movies are great but you get a lot more out of a TV series.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Coldplay has given us another great album with their release of X&Y last June, 2005.  The album is smooth, warm, and comfortably familiar with what we have come to expect from the British pop stars.  There has been no radical shift or application of a new technique and so Chris Martin and company deliver exactly what kind of sound we wanted.  The poetic lyrics are clear, crisp, and thoughtful and flow well with the music which appeals to the ears as well as the mind.   <br /> Tracks such as \\"What If\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\" are immediately recognizable as Mr. Martin enters by accompanying a beautiful soliloquy with his catchy piano beats while then the rest of the band wait for the timely entrance.  The lyrics inspire thoughtful self reflection by covering topics such as love and acceptance, which is again a comfortably familiar aspect of the two previous albums. <br /> I like Coldplay because their music is able to grab and keep hold of my ever diminishing attention span.  What I mean is that I haven't seem yet to get bored with any of their songs, because if I don't feel like listening to the lyrics, the instruments are there to keep me engaged.  The music is warm and friendly and often times I find is perfect for when I am alone or having guests over to visit.  It is quality sound and reminds me a lot of other great artists such as U2 and Radiohead.  I look forward to following this band as they continue to make great music.
B000059XUI|4.0|\\"Superman II\\" is still one of my all-time favorite sequels.  Despite the production problems, it's structurally a better film than the original, which was pretty uneven.  Sure, it lacks some of the epic visual scope of the first film, and the special effects vary in quality.  But Supe II has a stronger storyline and spine than the first film, and it gives Lois and Clark more human feelings, and strives to create more real people rather than comic book characters like we saw in the first film. <br /> <br />General Zod is a fantastic villain, evil to the core.  And the battle in Manhattan still excites me and makes me laugh.  Near the end, where the three meanies meet their doom in the Fortress of Solitude, I love to cheer for Superman.  <br /> <br />Though there are a number of plot holes and continuity problems, this movie still holds up very well today with more fun, excitement, and style than most action films made in recent years.  My only complaint is that the DVD does not have many features.  I would have liked to see the making of Supe II and some deleted scenes that were shown on network television.  Otherwise, a great movie to watch again and again.
B000AADYYO|5.0|This album introduced me to opeth. I had just heard that the cd had beeen released and went down and bought it in the local cd shop. In the beginning i was a bit sceptic to the death metal voices, but after a week i started to like it, it fitted to the music. And wow the voice is some of the best ive heard, it can change from really hard to soft beauty. unique. For the playing, i just started to smack myself. This is very very good. These guys can be compared to Black Sabbath. They have so many styles in theire music that its just stunning. And at a length of mostly 10 minuttes song, all styles are combined. Really its a unique sound ,i have never heard in a band before. And i have heard a lot of metal music. Nothing comes near this perfection. So people  that dont give this a try, o my they miss a lot. This is just beautiful. The acustic guitar is very nice. No song on this album is weaker than any other, they are all something special. I have now bought almost all theire albums for a period of 2 weeks, because this was too good to be missed. <br />
B0008KLVG4|2.0|\\"Jaws\\" is definitely one of the great summer movies of all time.  Though the shark looks fake, there is character development and genuine thrills in this film that most modern-day movies lack.   <br /> <br />I have the 25th anniversary edition, but unfortunately, like many other reviewers, I was disappointed and infuriated when I bought the 30th anniversary DVD only to find it offered little more than what the 25th anniversary DVD offered.  I also don't like how the sound was remastered, especially at the end with the big explosion, which sounds muffled and weak.  And a number of choppy scenes and cuts still remain in this version, which is upsetting, given the film won an Oscar for Best Editing. <br /> <br />Like other reviewers, I am angry at Universal for releasing this edition only five years after the last DVD, with little to show for it.  I felt pretty duped when I realized that the 30th anniversary edition was almost identical to the 25th anniversary DVD, but with more attractive packaging.  The studio could at least offer a rebate on the DVD for those of us who bought the earlier edition. <br /> <br />I guess I'm a little stupid for buying this edition, but I can't help it, I'm a loyal \\"Jaws\\" fan and always will be.
B000001ELF|5.0|Of the four KISS solo albums released in 1978, Ace Frehley, a.k.a. the Spaceman, was the most successful.  His was by far the most energetic and most KISS-like of the four thanks to the guitar theatrics that made the live version of \\"Shock Me\\" on Alive II really come alive.  Add to that, the single \\"New York Groove,\\" a cover of Hello's song, reached #13, the highest of all the singles released by the KISS solo albums, combining Frehley's signature electric guitar sound to a skiffle beat.  An appropriate song, considering the group's roots.  Eddie Kramer, who took KISS through KISS's Rock And Roll Over and Love Gun, took the producer's helm for Ace's solo debut, which explains the hardy crunch of guitar rock.<br /><br />However, energetic rockers like \\"Rip It Out\\" and \\"Speeding Back To My Baby\\" give a one-two punch that sends the album into gear.  The former is a favourite, a slam against a cruel woman, the title referring to ripping out someone's heart.  When he says \\"I hope you suffer,\\" I send that sentiment to a certain student on Oct. 2004, the day my own heart died.  In contrast, the protagonist of the latter song seems to have second thoughts--\\"maybe I should turn around, maybe I should stop,\\" while going through his thoughts and going 95 mph and with the radio blasting, completing with zooming sound effects during the chorus.<br /><br />Then there are other songs demonstrating the effects of the Space Ace's, well, imbibing.  The mid-paced \\"Snow Blind\\" shows that \\"he can't see a thing\\" and is \\"lost in space.\\"  And \\"Ozone\\" features a slowed-down guitar and droning voice of someone spaced out of their heads.  Someone \\"who likes feeling high/.../I really like to fly\\"-no doubt what this song is about.  A great lazy song to just lounge around or get wasted on!  With a nod to the Surfari's song \\"Wipe Out,\\" from the opening crazy laugh, \\"Wiped Out\\" has the protagonist getting drunk as a skunk and living it up with a girl at a party, while a slowed down, hardened spacey guitar plays during the chorus.  Great solo too!<br /><br />\\"I'm In Need of Love\\" shows Frehley giving some kick to his vocals, with some really creative playing and fills, while the brisk \\"What's On Your Mind\\" sizzles with some crunchy guitar chords that may well have inspired Soundgarden.<br /><br />The opening bells in the instrumental \\"Fractured Mirror\\" kind of heralds to Black Sabbath's titled song, but what actually follows is a reflective acoustic number punctuated with blasts of electric guitar, a showcase for the Spaceman's virtuoso skills.<br /><br />Since singing \\"Shock Me\\" from Love Gun, Ace's abilities as a vocalist and naturally guitarist are best realized here.  Anton Fig's drumming is a really kick in the a** here, especially on \\"Rip It Out.\\"  And it paid off in that Ace was given a lot more vocal chores on Dynasty and Unmasked, though his disgust at the direction KISS took in the Music From The Elder yielded only one song from him.  Of the four solo albums, Peter Criss's is still my personal favourite, but the Spaceman's oeuvre comes a close second.pacey guitar plays during the chorus.

B000B0WODA|5.0|This album is as wonderful as their first album.  So many surprises.  this cd is a must buy.  it is infectious, once you listen to it, you'll want to listen to it over and over again.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Great Album some of my fav. tracks include but are not limited to <br />1. What if <br />2. Swallowed by the sea <br />3. Square one <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was skeptical about this show at first, but when I saw that Joss Whedon was involved I checked it out. I'm a huge fan of the Buffy and Angel series so it didn't surprise me that the show worked beautifully. Great characters, stories, AND special effects make this a favorite of mine for sure. Buy this set and then go see the movie Serenity.
B00005JKG9|3.0|Selected scenes of the movie is good for managers and small business owners to show to their sub-ordinates. This special edition has documentary on salesmen psychology, which adds to the value of the price.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|I just bought dylan's masterpiece Blood on the Tracks. The critics label it as a masterpiece but I believe its just an above average album with some wonderful songs. Dont get me wrong I love this remastered version on hybird SACD super audio CD. But you really cant tell of a huge difference unless you own the super audio CD player. But its a good album with some wonderful lyrics..........of course. Dylan had it rough before he released this having divorced marriage, and a huge tour with the famous band. But besides the stories the songs are good, I liked some of dylan's earlier albums better, but it doesnt really matter which aspect of dylan's career you like it matters if you enjoy this album. So sample it on amazon and check it out for yourself. Tangled Up In Blue is the best song on here and is one of my favorite dylan classics. Enjoy! <br />
B000002IAS|4.0|The stardom of Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett rode on the waves of the husband-and-wife musical teams popular in the late 1960's and early 1970's, such as Ike and Tina Turner.  Ironically, before marrying Delaney, Bonnie Lynn had performed as an Ikette for Ike and Tina.  Possessing loads more combined talent than duos such as The Captain and Tenille, or even Paul McCartney and wife Linda, Delaney and Bonnie were able to attract a stage full of big name performers to tour and record with them.  Among the luminaries featured on the 'On Tour' disc are co-headliner Eric Clapton, former Traffic founder Dave Mason, Clapton's future Domino's (Carl Radle on bass, Bobby Whitlock on keyboards, and Jim Gordon on drums), Rita Coolidge on backing vocals, and session horn men extraordinaire Bobby Keys and Jim Price.  Percussionist Tex Johnson is also along for the ride, but his conga and bongo drums are completely humbled in the ensuing din.  Like Ike and Tina, Delaney and Bonnie possessed a penchant for uping the tempo of their frequent cover songs by several notches, and blowing the competition away in a hail of decibels.  The analogy with black artists is also not lost in their song selection, ranging from a medley of Little Richard hits, to a cover of black Gospel singer Bessie Griffin's composition, 'That's What My Man Is For' (as a slow-tempo traditional blues number, it serves as a mid-set respite from the high-energy tracks D & B are best known for), to Delaney Bramlett's tribute to Robert Johnson.    The best tracks on 'On Tour' are neatly distributed amongst the eight total tracks, all of which range between four and six minutes.  The opening track, 'Things Get Better', track four, 'I Don't Want To Discuss It', and the Clapton-Bonnie Bramlett composition, 'Coming Home' (the next-to-last track) are all worthy of repeat listens.  'Coming Home', in particular, possesses a distinct Clapton signiture guitar foundation, making it the stand-out track.  Despite having Dave Mason in tow, D & B's cover of Mason's 'Only You Know and I Know' can't compete with Mason's own rendition(s), despite reaching #20 on the pop charts in 1970 (D & B's only other charting song, 'Never Ending Song of Love', charted out at number 13).  The remaining tracks are rather generic, although the impressive instrumentation is admirable track after track.    This March, 1970 release was recorded in Croydon, England, and the crowd, given the combined on-stage presence of guitar hero's Clapton and Mason (fresh from his epic release 'Alone Together'), are noticably enthused at witnessing what even then had to be considered an historic performance.  The packaging of the disc doesn't do justice to its importance, however.  The recordings themselves have never been remastered, nor has the disc been expanded with unreleased tracks, which certainly must exist.  Nevertheless the sound is exceptional, given the era in which it was recorded.  For fans of white-soul music, as well as followers of Eric Clapton, the disc would have to be considered essential.  For everyone else, it all depends on how the Delaney and Bonnie 'sound' sounds to you.

B0009Y336A|4.0|As a diehard fan of British music, Supergrass is probably my favorite British band of the past decade. Expecting to hear Caught By The Fuzz, Moving, Richard III, Alright, Grace, or anything they have put out, I was surprised by this effort. It is definatly, more mature, cool, folky, and reflective. What a surprise. They don't sound like the teen, early twenties kids, that we have all been expecting. These guys sound older and that is refreshing. While the amps, tempo may have been slowed, the beautiful melody and harmony is still presented, just in a different way. My favorites are St. Petersburg, Sad Girl, Kick in the Teeth and Low C in my opinion is as good as anything they have done. And the final song, Fin is a beautiful sad closer to this surprising album that none of us expected. Previous reviewers who said this album is boring and complacent are totally wrong. This trio, or I should say quatro, are in their own league now and make music that is simply impressive.My only complaint about this album is why is there only nine songs? Yes there are a few duds, and that's why I give it four stars. It kind of reminds me of their third album, which is my favorie despite all the so-called critics who call that their worst effort. I dig the piano on this album. Mellow, <br />mature, and beautiful. That is my opinion of this album. I am only guessing what their next album will sound like. A follower of this, or back to their signature sound.
0446677450|1.0|Many years ago, we all probably saw those infomercials with Don Lapre trying to peddle his \\"Making Money\\" package. Now in reality the only person making money was Lapre selling his package to lazy, naive and desperate people trying to make fast money. But so many people wanted to believe in him that they bought his package and tried to become rich with thousands of classified ads, 900 numbers, etc. only to end up wasting thousands of dollars! <br /> <br />Lapre has since come up with a new scam, er, \\"business opportunity\\" called the \\"Greatest Vitamins in the World\\" and those informercials are still on TV in cable-access channels at 3am. It must be working cause I still see them. <br /> <br />What does Don Lapre have to do with Robert Kiyosaki, you ask? Well just like Lapre, Kiyosaki peddles his money making package at 3am on cable access channels called \\"Choose to Be Rich\\". The reality is that no one will become rich solely based on Kiyosaki's \\"teachings\\" because all of Kiyosaki's seminars, books and materials are just packaged fluff and hot air. <br /> <br />If you read any of his books and analyze it word by word and sentence by sentence, you'll quickly realize that its all full of platitudes, empty phrases and drivel that sound like it is saying something profound and meaningful without actually saying much of anything at all. For instance, you'll find Kiyosaki saying stuff like, \\"To be financially independent, you need secure sources of passive income that exceed expenditures...So all you need to do is create or obtain passive sources of income and you will achieve your goal of being financially independent.\\" That's not a direct quote but it more or less summarizes the kind of \\"insight\\" you'll get from Kiyosaki. <br /> <br />Think about this. If you were actually as successful as Kioysaki claims to be, already wealthy, financially independent and \\"retired\\", would you be making these Don Lapre-type informercials airing at 3am or putting together all those sleazyrip-off seminars??? Now I don't doubt he does make money (so does Lapre), but he is certainly making it by ripping off of lazy, naive and desperate people to feed his own big spending habits while providing almost nothing in return. In the end, Kiyosaki's followers are no less pathetic than Lapre's.
B000068G9X|5.0|Danzig's self-titled debut album is my favorite album from Danzig.  Every song is its own masterpiece!  My favorite track on this very wonderful album was \\"Posession\\".  I recommend this album for any metalhead, blues lover, or classic rock 'n roller!  Whatever someone may price this CD, it is worth it most DEFINITELY!
B0000BYM3K|1.0|i've never listened to this cd but man, that has to be about the worst album cover i have ever laid eyes on.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|if one takes the three seconds to examine the reviews written by the haters of this film, their argumentative fallacy precipitates easily: their argument is completely ad-hominem.  they either attack the viewer of the film or the creators of the film.  there is no substance as to why the film itself is bad or pretentious, too existential etc.  usually when people fall upon the ad-hominem fallacy, they are really naming problems that they have with themselves and then project them upon the thing that spurns that discomfort.
0671015206|5.0|When I first started reading through the first bit of this book and made it to the \\"Frugal, Frugal, Frugal\\" chapter I had my doubts.  I'm young and I wasn't sure that I wanted to be that \\"frugal\\" in order to be wealthy later in life.  Why not live it up while I'm young and let things take care of themselves later on? <br /> <br />Then I went to work the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and I realized something.  I don't want to work forever.  \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" doesn't say that you can't own anything or ever go on vacation, it tries to teach you to save money and spend money wisely. <br /> <br />Personally, if I have to drive a two year old car instead of a new car and live in a 1,500 sq. ft. house instead of a 3,000 sq. ft. house I think I can handle that if it helps me move toward retiring early and enjoying life. <br /> <br />Read this book, especially the first few chapters, which apply to people with and without kids.  Give it a chance, don't reject the notions right away, and see if it inspires you as well.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|You can talk till you're blue in the face but simply listen to it and you'll know that this record is unbelievably good. The best part is that songs switch right in the middle from Hip Hop to dance and the other way around to constantly give you an element of surprise. It's never boring and sounds creative from the beginning till the end. The album only has 2 weaker songs: All Alone and White light, the rest of the 15 songs will keep you on the edge of your seat. Especially the Dennis Hopper spoken word, with a brilliant melody in the background, is ground breaking (Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head). This album entails the best mix of rock, Hip Hop and Dance to date which makes it truly unique. It is absolutely unheard of. Nothing short of brilliant.
B000089J0R|5.0|The very first time that I heard Dragonforce play I was absolutely blown away by their furious speed: and it's not just speed with direction or purpose either. These guys are fast, but they all stay in time together, and they don't lose themselves in the music despite how fast they play. I realize that a great number of people dislike progressive metal because of the keyboards or the singers' voices, but if you don't mind either I would highly recommend this band. The lyrics are, admitedly, somewhat cheesy and I always think of things like the Diablo games and such when I hear Dragonforce, but they play at a skill level that is soaring far above 99% of the artists out there today.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|Adam Sandler (Paul Crewe) is great in this film.  Heck, everyone is great in this film!  This is one of the best remakes I have ever seen.<br /><br />One of the best things about the film is Sandler actually looks tired, beat, and downright exactly how I would picture a former NFL star quarterback who lost it all and ends up in jail.  Sandler proves that he has staying power with this film.<br /><br />Chris Rock (Caretaker) is excellent as the man to talk to and get the lowdown on prison life (more importantly, how to not end up someone's girlfriend).  Rock has some really funny lines, and he just seemd to fit this role better than I thought he would.  I think this is his greatest work yet, and I hope he just keeps moving up from here.  \\"Hey, Chris, if you read this, thanks for making me laugh out loud after an eighty-hour work week!  You rock, Rock.\\"<br /><br />Burt Reynolds (Coach Nate Scarborough)didn't turn in the performance of a lifetime or anything, but he didn't do all that bad either.  The man has been through so much in his life, it was cool just to know he has bounced back so many times.  He's not a quitter, that's for sure.  I think he's a lot like the coach he played in the movie.  I still want to buy that Trans-Am from Smokey and The Bandit!  If you read this, Mr. Reynolds, can I at least take the T/A out for a weekend?  C'mon, I've spent a lot of loot on your films.<br /><br />William Fichtner (Captain Knauer) is always great in whatever role he plays.  From \\"Grace Under Fire\\" to \\"Contact\\" to \\"The Longest Yard\\", Fichtner is one of my favorite actors.  He never overacts.  He never underacts.  He just slides into a role as himself, and somehow makes it work like it's nobody's business.<br /><br />Nelly (Megget) has got skills - acting skills that is.  It was almost like he has been in jail before.  He was that good!  But best of all, he actually managed to pull off the small amount of talking parts and still be so memorable in the film.<br /><br />Megget: \\"Y'all got a running back?\\"<br /><br />Paul Crewe: \\"Not any good ones.\\"<br /><br />Ya gotta love it!<br /><br />Michael Irvin, Walter Williamson, David Patric Kelly (Warriors, come out to play!), Goldberg (Who's Next?), Terry Crews (with cheese), Bob Sapp (He broke-ded my nose), and the rest of the cast deserve all the credit in the world for coming together to make one of the best movie remakes in the history of film!<br /><br />This movie has a little bit of everything.  See it, buy it, rent it...whatever...just don't skip it.<br /><br />See ya next review.br />  <br />Megget: \\"Y'all got a running back?\\" <br /> <br />Paul Crewe: \\"Not any good ones.\\" <br /> <br />Ya gotta love it! <br /> <br />Michael Irvin, Walter Williamson, David Patric Kelly (Warriors, come out to play!), Goldberg (Who's Next?), Terry Crews (with cheese), Bob Sapp (He broke-ded my nose), and the rest of the cast deserve all the credit in the world for coming together to make one of the best movie remakes in the history of film! <br /> <br />This movie has a little bit of everything.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|I actually went to a live Dangerous Concert at Roundhay Park, Leeds, England.  The concert was amazing and one of the most important moments of my life.  Michael was sensational, not only does he move, sing and dance like no one else but he transforms the whole arena with his incredible stage presence.  You are literally seeing one of the best performers on stage ever, if not the best!<br /><br />It would be difficult to capture this brilliance on DVD, not to mention the atmosphere but I would say the Bucharest Dangerous concert DVD comes very close.  I have watched it numerous times and even now it brings out all kinds of emotions.  The quality is excellent and you get to see the magnificence of Michael Jackson plus the astonishing reactions from the crowd so you can literally feel the atmosphere.<br /><br />This concert is quite simply a point in history, a time when a musician could bring out pure emotion in a crowd through excellence in music and dance.<br /><br />Buy this, you won't see a better artist in concert and I guarantee anyone who takes a chance on this will be a fan.  I became one after the Dangerous Concert in Leeds and I've been to many more concerts since.  He never fails to please.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />Full Tracking Listing:<br /><br />  1. \\"Introduction\\"<br />  2. \\"Jam\\"<br />  3. \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\"<br />  4. \\"Human Nature\\"<br />  5. \\"Smooth Criminal\\"<br />  6. \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" (duet with Siedah Garrett)<br />  7. \\"She's out of My Life\\"<br />  8. \\"I Want You Back\\"<br />  9. \\"The Love You Save\\"<br />  10. \\"I'll Be There\\"<br />  11. \\"Thriller\\"<br />  12. \\"Billie Jean\\"<br />  13. \\"Black Panther\\" (Video Interlude)<br />  14. \\"Workin' Day and Night\\"<br />  15. \\"Beat It\\"<br />  16. \\"Will You Be There\\"<br />  17. \\"Black or White\\"<br />  18. \\"Heal the World\\"<br />  19. \\"Man in the Mirror\\"<br />  20. \\"Finale\\"<br />  21. \\"Credits\\"
0553573403|5.0|I am typically a Mystery/Suspense novel snob. Rarely have I varied my path from those books, but more and more recently I have been making the switch. At a time when mystery novels have nearly ceased to excite me, I have needed to look elsewhere. I would have never expected to find comfort in the arms of Sci-fi/Fantasy, yet here I am before you.<br /><br />I have read The Lord of the Rings, but my experience beyond has been disappointing. A few years ago, at the urging of a friend I picked up a copy of The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan, Book 1 of the Wheel of Time series. My first non-Tolkien Sci-fi/Fantasy experience was a bust. It probably took me a week if not more to read the first 13 pages. Try though I might, I could not find myself lost in Jordan's world. At 832 pages, it was not a book I wanted to take my time and give a truly fair chance.<br /><br />Needless to say that I was hesitant when the recommendation came to try the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin. Same friend as before to make the recommendation, but this time he let the book speak for itself. A Game of Thrones spoke loudly to me. I actually read the first however many pages right from Amazon.com and before I knew it I had bought a copy.<br /><br />Martin's writing style, in respect to different chapters, was very interesting. He titled a chapter as the name of a key character and then the subsequent pages would be some unfolding of the story from that character's perspective. This kept the story fresh at all times; ever-changing.<br /><br />I will warn you that if you are a reader who likes to see each character to whom you become attached remain unharmed, this may not be the series for you. Martin dares to allow the big name(s) to die. Not all authors will take this step, I like it. It makes you realize that at any time, any one of the characters in the story could be killed. Not that this book needed help creating excitement, but this element certainly added to it.<br /><br />In true Sci-fi/Fantasy style, A Game of Thrones was a long book (Book 2, A Clash of Kings is even longer). When I would normally expect relief at the end of such a long book (807 pages), here I found actual goosebumps and the burning desire to continue the series.<br /><br />I applaud the author for his writing; his mix of sci-fi/fantasy with mystery and romance and everything in between, I thank Thomas for his recommendation which I pass on to you, and I order my copy of Book 2.it.  <br /> <br />In true Sci-fi/Fantasy style, A Game of Thrones was a long book (Book 2, A Clash of Kings is even longer).

B0009X7664|5.0|This movie is arguably America's greatest movie.  Based on Harper Lee's only novel of the same name, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a cinematic achieve that transcends time.  This movie, directed by Robert Mulligan stars one of America's most professional artists Gregory Peck.  Peck plays Atticus Finch, the widower-father of his son Jem and daughter Scout.<br /><br />\\"To Kill\\" is one of those few picture experiences where the movie translates the feel and essence of a book.  I remember the first time I read Harper's book and then catching the movie a few years later (I read the book in 1979) and I was mesmerized that Peck was to me, Atticus Finch.  Mary Badham was Scout and Philip Alford is Jem.<br /><br />This movie is the standard for all art, for it speaks about transcendent justice and right over wrong, good vs. evil and the harsh realities these ideas and realities bring forth; but it also speaks to wonder, mystery, love and courage - things worth living for.<br /><br />The extras are nice and seeing Peck in his twilight with his family is warm.  The bonus feature on making \\"To Kill\\" is great and many of teh people acting in the film as well as other social commentators, recall memories as well as the films social importance.<br /><br />Thank you Gregory Peck; Thank you Harper Lee; Thank you to all who worked on this great piece of art...we are much better people for it.
B000002GB6|5.0|I remember hearing the song \\"Feels so Good\\" every once and a while as a child in the late 70s/early 80s, and it's one of those songs that simply stays with you.  Fast forward a couple decades (holy cow!   almost thirty years!!!), it sounds as good today as it did so many years ago.  The entire cd is outstanding.  I just wish the Theme from \\"Side Street\\" was a few minutes longer.  Definitely a must have.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|This is singing of astonishing technical fluency and emotional power. I was not surprised by the ease and punch of her runs, trills, ornamentation; that is how Bartoli first impressed us. But in this recital, it is the power of her intense fragility, to borrow from e.e.cummings, that most moves me. The interpretation of \\"Lascia la spina\\" is breathtaking and heartbreaking. Like the fabulous Jo Stafford, she uses her amazing breath control as a means of emotional communication.<br /><br />Through her last few CDs - the Vivaldi album, the Gluck project and now this current CD - Bartoli has emerged as a mature, full-bodied, full-on interpretive artist. There is no one on the current scene to match her for virtuosity, fearless risktaking, or emotional profundity.
B00005JOHO|5.0|Even non-golf fanatics will thoroughly enjoy this engaging true story.  The cinematograhpy is outstanding.  The story line has as much to do with the socio-economic dynamic in 1830 (AND still very alive and present in 2005 America!) as it does with the compelling match up of a British golfer and a young, socially 'disadvantaged' American.  For those of us who had no knowledge of this legendary golf match, the build up to the outcome is taut.  <br />The performances given in 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' are worthy of Oscar consideration in my humble opinion.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Excellent movie with a slight left leaning.Arley Ermey breaks out with a great performance as the D.I.Grim,but well acted overall with Matthew Modine turning in a great performance.
B000069I1H|3.0|Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro do a thoroughly enjoyable job as two buddy cops on the streets of L.A. Trey (Murphy) is the cop-in-training who wants to be a real cop...on TV of course. While De Niro plays Mitch, a tough, no-frills cop who doesn't take much off of anybody. In this hilarious comedy, two unlikely characters are thrown together to do a reality cop show. While Mitch hates the whole idea of the show, Trey can't help but be caught up in he idea of being a star.<br /><br />The mishaps that follow these two around are laugh-out-loud funny, and the friendship that results is a great ending to this movie. If you are either an Eddie Murphy or a Robert De Niro fan, or you just like movies about cops, this is definitely one you should see.
B00097A5I6|5.0|I've always been a huge Oasis fan since I can remember...Being one of the absolute standout bands that made the 90's what they were...An appreciation for just pure classic rock and roll is something that I cherish, and I know all you Oasis fans out there know what I mean...Before listening to Don't Believe The Truth, ask yourself a question: What would Oasis sound like if they existed during the 60's, rather than today?...Well this album is the answer to that question...From the opening sounds of Turn Up The Sun, to the fading chords of Let There Be Love, you feel as if you've warped back to 1964, and its Oasis ruling the world rather than The Beatles...I can't help but think that if Liam and Noel Gallagher were making music back then, that they'd be heralded as music legends and icons to this very day...This is the first album (although I LOVE every one) since Definitely Maybe where Oasis sound as if they don't have to prove anything to anyone, or impress anyone at the same time...Free-wheeling barnstormer and first single \\"Lyla\\" is a song you never would have heard on Be Here Now, or Standing on The Shoulder of Giants...what makes the song great is that its pure classic rock and roll at its best...it reminds me of when I first heard Cigarettes & Alcohol off Definitely Maybe... <br /> <br /> <br />But why this album peaks is the fact that you'd never expect Oasis to make an album like this...I like to call this a quiet album, because it exemplifies a more mature Oasis, an Oasis that realizes its proven itself over and over again, and that they don't have to anymore, its not necessary, they don't owe anything to anyone anymore...This is a classic album in that it sounds like something they'd record before having a record deal, if they were unknowns, if they didn't have a dime in their pockets, which as far as I'm concerned, is music at its best, because its from the heart... <br /> <br />As far as the songs, each one will have you humming along when you least expectit...The Importance of Being Idle is the ideal sing along song...Lyla stands on its own...Let There Be Love is a beautiful ballad that takes you back to 1995 all over again, just like Stop Crying Your Heart Out did off of Heathen Chemistry...Love Like a Bomb includes a piano session which is the most beautiful 30 seconds of this entire album (you know what I'm talking about if you've heard the song)...and every other song on the album is a sleeper hit (I'm partial to \\"I Will Keep The Dream Alive\\") <br /> <br />Oasis reach out and sing to your heart, and they've made me appreciate music in a way that words can't describe...with this album they've returned to form, to their lost innocence...the day's of old, and this is truly one Coca-Cola Classic of an album...ENJOY!
B00003CY6M|4.0|This movie is perfect for anyone who wants a good movie for Valentine's Day viewing. It stars Kate Beckinsale as Sara and John Cusack as Jonathan, both New Yorkers who have a chance meeting one time which brings Sara to the conclusion that if they are meant to be together then fate will do so for them. Tossing all of this aside they go their seperate ways. A few years fo by and both Sara and Jonathan are preparing to marry their fiances, when their paths cross yet again. The results are both hilarious and heartwarming. This movie definitely gets two thumbs up from me, so check out this movie and you won't be disappointed.

B000683VI4|4.0|This movie is one of the most touching love stories that I've seen in a long time. The movie starts with James Garner playing the role of an elderly man who comes and reads to an Alzheimer's patient (Gena Rowlands). As you go through the movie you will want to laugh and cry as you fall in love with both characters of the story. You will watch as Noah and Allie struggle through what everyone calls \\"just a summer romance.\\"<br /><br />Despite everything Allie tries to do, she is torn from Noah's arms and leaves with her family to New York. Noah has to leave for war, but when he returns he loses any will to do anything without Allie by his side. What unfolds is both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. So I hope you enjoy this wonderful love story as much as I did.

B000056BOR|5.0|This is the must-see Romantic Comedy of the early 1960's. With Doris Day playing the part of an out-of-work, girl-next-door, who gets splashed in the street by a very well-to-do man in his car, played by Cary Grant. As the story unfolds, Phillip (Grant) tries to apologize to Cathy (Day) by offering to buy her a new dress, which she promptly turns down saying \\"Money doesn't buy good manners.\\" Upon arrival at Phillips office, instead of throwing the money back in his face, Cathy falls for Phillip and is immediately whisked away on a private jet with Phillip to a board meeting, a UN speech, and ends the day by attending a baseball game. Phillip, who is totally smitten with Cathy, ask her to go away with him for the weekend to the Bahamas! What follows is a hilarious sequence of events in which Cathy begins having second thoughts about her weekend with Phillip. For Phillip, the weekend proves to be more trouble for him than it is relaxing. All in all this movie proves to be a very funny and entertaining love story, with Grant's endearing personality and Day's graceful charm.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|It's hard to come up with music this good these days. My pick for best of 2005, and probably 2004, too. The rock pickings have been slim since the '70s, but releases like this make me feel better about my generation. It's too bad Sufjan Stevens probably won't get the recognition he deserves for this intricately beautiful work.
B0000844IT|3.0|Watching the SciFi Channel's presentation of Army of Darkness spurred me to yet again pull out my \\"Boomstick Ed.\\" copy and compare it. <br /> <br />Sure enough, the SciFi version (as with the one running on sister network USA for years) contains many scenes missing from both the theatrical and director's cuts, e.g. the Ash-Arthur fight at the beginning.  In general, this cable version contains all the \\"deleted scenes\\" available separately on the director's cut DVD...EXCEPT that they are integrated seamlessly in the main film, and the picture quality is consistent/flawless - much unlike the director's edition! <br /> <br />When I bought \\"Boomstick,\\" I was hoping this cable version was the one I was getting.  Now I've finally confirmed this is not the case.  My next question:  anyone know if the cable version was ever released on DVD?  That's the one to shoot for. <br /> <br />Buyer beware with \\"Boomstick.\\"  You'd be better off to get the regular edition & tape the other one off SciFi.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Let me just say... I had only heard 2 a7x songs prior to listening to City Of Evil. Chapter 4 (from the previous \\"Waking the Fallen\\") and Bat Country. I really got the album because of Bat Country, it is an amazing song from top to bottom. After purchasing the album, I can't even begin to choose a favorite. This is one of those rare albums you can pop in the CD player and completely neglect the skip button all the way through. I am still listening to it nonstop all the time and I think they have become my favorite band, and I didn't even really enjoy harder rock until I heard City of Evil and then Waking the Fallen. a7x has restored my faith in rock and roll. Rock on dudes, but lose the nail polish maybe. Also - 11 tracks might not seem like a lot of music but when added up it's well over 70 minutes, every song is at least 5 mins.  <br /> <br />Breakdown  <br /> <br />1.) Beast and the Harlot - 8.5/10 great opening track <br /> <br />2.) Burn It Down - 9/10 Breakneck speed that stops on a dime and hits hard until the end.   <br /> <br />3.) Blinded in Chains - 7.5/10 Not one of the best tracks but Its still a quality song  <br /> <br />4.) Bat Country - 10/10 I loved it even more when I found it was a tribute to Hunter S Thompson and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  <br /> <br />5.) Trashed and Scattered - 9/10 - Along the lines of Burn it down.  This one starts off a little slow but then it picks up and kills all the way through. Awesome chorus.  <br /> <br />6.) Seize the Day - 9/10 this one grew on me, I'm a fan of piano infused into rock (Think November Rain or I won't see you tonight part 1)  <br /> <br />7.) Sidewinder - 10/10 It's awesome all the way through, and the acoustics at the end is the icing on the cake.  <br /> <br />8.) The Wicked End - 11/10 Quite possibly the greatest song I have ever heard, I am still blown away when Shadows' voice and the instruments join in with the orchestra. It's dominance defined. They actually did this live too with the full string orchestra and boys choir.  <br /> <br />9.) Strength of the World - 10/10 It's long but it's just so good. Again, the guitar solos will blow you away.  <br /> <br />10.) Betrayed - 9.5/10 Great Tribute to the late great Dimebag <br /> <br />11.) MIA - 8/10 Another good mix of slow down and start back up, which they've been doing through the whole album. Kind of tough to have to Follow up tracks 7-10, but it manages.

I did not expect greatness, but was pleasantly suprised at how much I enjoyed the actors, the scenery, and the way they portrayed the characters.  It's not too long, and not too slow so you won't get bored.  You will want to watch it more than once!

The book is very heavy, so you will not be able to move it around much, but that does not take anything away. Rather, it allows you to minimize damage. The layout is also very nice, with the author's foreword, anecdotes etc. The printing is also very sharp. Of course its the contents that matter- the book is filled from cover to cover with my favorite cartoon character's escapades. This will adorn my bookshelf for a long time.
B000066C1N|4.0|Yup I have to say that this soundtrack CD is nice to listen than most of the soundtrack albums that you get nowadays. Most people would think they're full of slow music that makes you go to sleep or just plain boring. I was very wrong when it came to this soundtrack. It's full of music you can relate to life experiences themselves. Thats why I loved this CD! Listen carefully and you can relate one or a few songs to the events of your life one way or another. The songs can range from high spirited energy songs of happiness to sorrowful echoes of sadness. Songs like \\"You Can't Take Me\\", \\"Get Off My Back\\" & \\"Run Free\\" (Instrumental) are points to look out for. Sorrowful ones like \\"Sound The Bugle\\", \\"Nothing I've Even Known\\" & \\"I Will Always Return\\"(FINALE) all deal will those sad moments in life. Just simple songs like these can really touch your soul. But the one I found rather annoying was that Adam keeps appearing on the album. Is this his abum or what? Well it's a good soundtrack for those of you who need some inspiration. This album is over all listener friendly and will not let you go sleep depending on your mood msotly. Give this CD a spin. Who knows it could change your outlook on life. It did for ME!!!!!
B00004Z400|5.0|*Gasp* The heart beat at the end of Pink Maggit proceeds to finish...and then my reaction. Simply amazing this cd is. So dark at times and this is definitely music at it's best. I enjoy all of Deftones albums, they're amazing. This album certainly isn't perfect, but still amazing. Here's the track reviews.  1.Back To School (Mini Maggit) 8.5/10...Good song. I know it was added on just to make a hit, and his has some rap in it, and seems out of place, but sometimes i do enjoy chino's adrenaline-esque rapping.  2.Feiticeira 9/10...Very good song, but also quite unusual. It starts off with a quick riff, followed by Chino's vocals which then the drums come in. This song is unusal because it lacks a chorus and this is actually a formula I could get used to.  3.Digital Bath 9/10...A very mellow song. Quite simply amazing, the lyrics involve Chino describing a homocide so to speak, of electricuting a girl in a bath tub.  4.Elite 8.5/10...Right when you think you've got this cd figured out, you're thrown off by this piece of work. \\"Elite\\" can go right up there with the Deftones heaviest songs list (engine no. 9, lotion, headup, hexagram, when girls telephone boys) Chino screams so hard in this song that it almost gives off a mechanical effect. It's actually a nice change of pace.   5.Rx Queen 8/10...Alot like Digital Bath and the chorus is amazing while the verses are only decent.  6.Street Carp 7/10...Basically an average Deftones rock song. I would definitely like this song more if it wasn't for the annoying vocals towards the end where Chino repeats \\"write it down! now did you get it get it!?\\"   7.Teenager 7.5/10...Deftones softest song to this point..and very turn-table driven. Extremely soft..get's a bit boring.  8.Knife Party 9/10...Now while the cd lost momentum towards the middle, 'knife party' is the song that picks it back up, and the last 5 songs on this cd definitely make the cd. Features some great female vocals.  9.Korea 10/10...'Korea' holds the second heaviest song title on 'White Pony'. Just extremely good.  10.Passenger 10/10...This is one of those rare occasioins where a song strikes me on my first listen. Features Maynard James Keenan from Tool. Just great.  11.Change (In The House Of Flies) 10/10...First hit off of 'White Pony' and deservingly so. Very depressing and Frank Delgado's effects blend well with Carpenter's guitar. Great song.  12.Pink Maggit 9.5/10...This is \\"back to school\\"'s mother. This is where the song came from. It is a great song, but the mellow part carries on for awhile but the transition from soft to heavy is great. Plus the heart beat at the end is amazing.    Just buy this. You will not regret it. Also get their other 4 cd's.
B000002I2M|5.0|The Doors' sixth studio album, \\"L.A. Woman,\\" wasn't supposed to be their grand finale. But with the untimely death of frontman Jim Morrison from heart failure in July 1971, such it became. But it is a magnificent album. The Doors got tougher on this one, mixing rock with blues and Morrison's powerful, distinctive voice & words to absolute perfection. The band sound totally rejuvenated on \\"L.A. Woman,\\" their musical chemistry right on target. Great rockin' tunes abound, such as the classics \\"Love Her Madly\\" and the rollicking title song, as well as \\"The Changeling.\\" Great, dirty blues numbers include \\"Been Down So Long,\\" \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" and \\"Crawling King Snake.\\" \\"Hyacinth House\\" is a beautiful song, and \\"The WASP (Texas Radio And The Big Beat)\\" allows Morrison a memorable beat-poet moment. But the band save the best number for last: the fantastic, atmospheric groover \\"Riders On The Storm.\\" With thunderstorm sound effects accompanying them, Morrison & the boys literally jam into the heavens for seven glorious minutes. It's my personal favorite Doors song of all---what a brilliant exit for this legendary band.After Morrison's passing, the surviving Doors---guitarist Robbie Krieger, keyboardist Ray Manzarek and drummer John Densmore---carried on as a trio for two more albums, \\"Other Voices\\" and \\"Full Circle.\\" It appears they now regard these two albums as a mistake, as they're both long out-of-print, and will probably remain so. These days, there is a current touring version of the Doors featuring Krieger and Manzarek (with the Cult's Ian Astbury on lead vocals), which I totally support, but there's no denying that the biggest chapter in the band's career came to an untimely close with \\"L.A. Woman.\\" Still, Jim Morrison and the Doors have left an everlasting mark in the history of rock, with six classic studio albums and many great live recordings. And \\"L.A. Woman\\" forever remains an outstanding final musical statement. It's an absolutely essential Doors album.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Let's take a stroll down memory lane. No, correction: let's take a stroll down the big broad generous boardwalk of Coney Island, down past the Carousel of Dying Dreams, pausing a moment to stare at the Ferris Wheel of Decay and Death and Dissolution.<br /><br />No. Don't stare. Darron Aronofsky's sophomore effort, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\", is a subversive instrument. It should be regulated by the secret police. It is a vicious sucker punch to the unprepared, unsuspecting kidney masquerading as an anti-drug flick. Be warned, this godawful thing has teeth. You will cry. You will blanch. Your face, virtuous, untainted by human sin (relatively, in our Relative World), will get all white and taut. You will get sick at your stomach. You might puke.<br /><br />OK, there; disclaimers out of the way. Ma Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn, amazing, truly, descended from Heaven with a fiery sword of Truth, I sh*t thee not) is a pudgy, rugose widow who dreams of getting on the game show she watches with cultic fervor. She lives in Brooklyn. She's aging, bored, flabby, tired. She is Hungry.<br /><br />Her son Harry Goldfarb (the incomparable Jared Leto): living on the fringe in Brooklyn, hooking up with his needle-romancing friends on the fringes of a decaying Coney Island. Harry wants to be rich. He wants to fly. He wants to do the funky chicken dance only unrestricted \\"H\\" can bring about. He dreams of the big score. He wants to buy Ma Goldfarb a huge-a**ed Tee-Vee, where she can watch Gameshows Valhalla-style. He is Hungry.<br /><br />Oh, but there's more: Dreams are like that. Like wars, they have dictionaries of casualties. There is an infinite supply of fresh, warm-blooded young meat for the grinder. Shall we continue? We shall. There's Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans, redeeming himself), who imagines himself to be a better man---for his own life, for his progeny---than he is. He wants a quick, fast, fat, profitable score. Who can blame him? Who wants to eat catfood in retirement? Hungry.<br /><br />But now, we can't forget Marion Silver (the astonishingly gorgeous Jennifer Connelly). Can we? We cannot. She is gorgeous. Her skin pulses with life. She is a rebel. She doesn't care. Ah, but she does. Youth cares, yes it does, for maybe it doesn't know of old age, but it can feel the thing's stinking corpse-breath. So yeah, Marion will deal---but she'd prefer not to. Which is why she goes along with Harry Goldfarb's \\"score\\". Hungry? Yup.<br /><br />Half of the horror is watching a field of roses go up in a napalm strike: in that spirit, I won't spoil anything for you. Well, other than to say this: Love, as some sage once observed, is the most furiously dangerous trap of all. Darren Aronofsky has set horror to celluloid: the horror of a billion lives of quiet, and noisy, desperation. Be afraid: be very afraid.<br /><br />JSGnt?

B0001I55OC|1.0|Maybe one and a half stars would be more accurate. After all, I've given one star to House of the Dead and this isn't nearly that level of dreck. I probably wouldn't have disliked 'Timeline' so much if I wasn't positive that there wasn't a better movie buried in here. The problems abound, however, and there are unresolved issues pretty much across the board. <br /> <br />The script is an absolute mess. Especially in a time-travel movie, when you create a set if rules for the science of your film, you HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM. For example, it's commented in the beginning of the film that no modern weaponry can make the leap back. OK, the technology hadn't been invented yet, that makes sense. So what do we see not ten minutes later ... a grenade? I'm not even going to mention how the ending of Merrick's character should have completely changed the future or the way a team of archeologists would so recklessly think nothing of interfering with the past. When writing this kind of a script, a screen-writer HAS to follow the rules he sets for himself. <br /> <br />I also never did come to understand why 3 or 4 people had to get killed going back to save a 70 year old man. Why exactly was he so important that you couldn't just leave him there? There were also a great number of characters were only developed half-way. I'm thinking, in particular, of every employee in the corporation that built the time machine. It seemed like there was more going on there that we, as an audience, were filled in on. <br /> <br />The set design is poor. I couldn't have put it better when another reviewer stated that the film looked like it was made on the back-lot of Monty-Python's Holy Grail. Everything just looked like it was made of cardboard. <br /> <br />Speaking of cardboard, the acting's awful. He seems to be my new whipping boy, but I'll say it again ... PAUL WALKER CANNOT ACT. He HAS to be the worst actor of the modern era. He CANNOT carry and headline a film, he doesn't have the ability.Other then that the cast list was pretty well loaded with talent that was never cultivated properly. <br /> <br />The directing was lazy. I'm normally a big Richard Donner fan. There have only been a handful of movies he's done that I really think were stinkers. Unfortunately, this is one of them. His resume is too loaded with great films to think that this was anything other then a hiccup. I'm not letting him off the hook either though. He had a TON of resources at his disposal and just couldn't bring ANY of it together. <br /> <br />The time and money that were pumped into `Timeline' really should have made for a better product then we were ultimately going to get. I'm instead left with the feeling that I'd be more inclined to just go watch `Braveheart' again.
0399152717|1.0|I found myself say \\"Gimme a break\\" again and again while progressing through the book.  Boring, one-dimensional characters, inane plot and factual errors are how I describe this book.  Don't waste your time -- you can do better.
B000AL730Y|5.0|This is Paul's finest solo work, ever.  But it will take at least three listenings to come to that realization. Nearly equal credit goes to the producer. The collaboration was just what Paul needed to buckle down and record some masterful tracks. Even on the typically McCartney-esq tunes like English Tea and Jenny Wren, there is a depth of musicality and instrument selection far more interesting and pleasing than they would have been had Paul produced on his own. Through several tracks -- such as How Kind of You and At The Mercy -- the complexity of the music is something we have never heard from the solo Paul, and the producer makes it work. There are two songs -- Fine Line and Anyway -- whose melodies are surprisingly \\"borrowed,\\" but I am sure it was not intentional. Overall, however, this CD is a wonderful, in-your-face answer to all those solo-McCartney critics out there. Great piece of work.

B000001GRZ|5.0|What makes these interpretations so special is the way that Fournier brings dancing rythms to them. No stiff, emotionless, cobweb playing for him of the kind that gives classical a bad reputation. Instead, what Fournier has provided is life giving, and an invitation for the 21st century mind to the dance.

B0002EXH40|4.0|Megadeth's sixth album is actually not very far removed from its predecessor (1992's \\"Countdown To Extinction\\"). It continues in the direction of that album, with slower, less-thrashy, more commercial and melodic songs. Plus, \\"Youthanasia\\" sounds slick and over-produced. Thus, this is arguably one of Megadeth's least strongest albums. That doesn't mean it's bad, though, because it does feature some classic gems (i.e. \\"A Tout Le Mode\\" is arguably one of Dave Mustaine's best written songs), some great guitar work (like in \\"Train of Consequences\\"), and a few very catchy choruses (as in \\"Elysian Fields\\"). \\"Reckoning Day\\" is a slowly thrashing song with a memorable opening riff, \\"Train of Consequences\\" shows off Mustaine's jazzy vocals as well as a superb guitar solo, \\"Blood of Heroes\\" has an acoustic opening riff, and \\"Black Curtains\\" is an interesting song which is lyrically about nuclear war. So, it may not be as popular as \\"Countdown to Extinction,\\" (it's not as good, either), but this is yet another solid Megadeth release, a worthy follow-up, and it's a must own for all Megadeth collections.
0618164413|4.0|I loved Curious George as a kid.  So of course my daughter had to be introduced to him.<br /><br />She loved the stories instantly.  It could be because of my enthusiasm for the stories.<br /><br />Her favorites were the first story because of the balloons and the one with learning the alphabet.  I had to read them several times.  Even a couple times in one sitting.<br /><br />The one bad thing about this book is the binding.  It wore out a little too easily.  Her Winnie the Pooh book is much bigger and it is still tight.  This book could have been better bound so I will knock it one point.<br /><br />Other then that it's a classic that will probably get read to my grandchildren someday.<br /><br />-edit-<br />I happened to be in a bookstore and noticed a different binding on a copy of the book.  This is probably why there is there are people saying it's bad and good.  My copy is old and the book only yellow.  The new book looks like they added a support \\"tape\\" to it.....
1400034779|5.0|This entire series is an absolute joy to read.  I noticed that at least one (young) reviewer complained about the lack of a central plot, but in my opinion this is one of the main strengths of the series - that the main characters and the day-to-day events of their lives are so absorbing.  It's such a rarity to find good character-based literature, and this series is an absolute gem in that department.

B0002EXH4K|5.0|Because Dave Mustaine didn't re-do any of the vocals, the only thing that is weird, is that the echoe sounds on the original were pushed back on it, now on the remaster, they are pushed forward, it sounds odd, but not bad at all, \\"Crown of Worms\\" is nothing special, but it's alright, \\"Countdown to Extinction demo\\" I never cared for this song, so this does nothing for me, \\"Symphony of Destruction demo\\" this is WAY different than the final, alot longer, the vocals are really different, but it's cool to hear it, Mustaine sounds weird on it, \\"Psychotron demo\\", not much different about it, just the vocals, Crown of Worms is alright, it just seems out of place, it's not that good, I don't even know why it was made, and the Countdown to Extinction demo does nothing for me, as the final never did, that song just sounds bland, not much cool stuff happening, the solo isn't really creative, heres a rundown of the original... <br /> <br />Skin o' My Teeth, Very catchy song, nice chorus 5/5 <br /> <br />Symphony of Destruction, One of my favorites from the album, nice riffs/vocals ect, the video is cool too! 5/6! <br /> <br />Architecture of Aggression, Another cool song, probably one of the fastest and heaviest on the CD, kind of reminds me of stuff off of Rust In Peace 5/5 <br /> <br />Foreclosure of a Dream, A nice more melodic song, which is what they were going for more on this album 5/5 <br />  <br />Sweating Bullets, Another favorite of mine on here, a wicked cool song, cool chorus 5/5 <br /> <br />This Was My Life, ehhh, this one is alright, doesn't really stand up to the ones that come before, 5/3 <br /> <br />Countdown to Extinction, don't even like this one, never did 5/0 <br /> <br />High Speed Dirt, same as above, rather boring 5/0 <br /> <br />Psychotron, now THIS is much better than the previous 3, cool lyrics and riffs 5/5 <br /> <br />Captive Honour, A very cool song here, love the court sounding intro, and the chorus is catchy 5/5 <br /> <br />Ashes In Your Mouth, a VERY nice closer, another song that sounds like Rust in Peace, 5/6! <br /> <br />All in all, it's a great album, it's not Rust in Peace, but what is, it's a nice follow-up, it's more melodic, it was Megadeths \\"The Black Album\\", The last 2 demo tracks on the remaster are nice, but the first 2 don't do anything for me, as I said, I never liked the title track, and Crown of Worms is mediocre, you will notice on the remaster, that the echoes are pushed up, as on the original, they were pushed back, it sounds weird at first, but you'll get used to it, I still have my original anyways, so I'm at no loss, but it sounds pretty good, beware of the Rust In Peace remaster, while that is alright as well, he re-did the vocals on 3 of the songs, the Youthanasia remaster is pretty cool though, he didn't do much to that, it didn't even need to be remastered really, but he did it, Avoid the So Far So Good...So What! remaster though, he really screwed that one up, haven't heard the Killing is my Business...And Business is good one, nor the Cryptic Writings one, but the 3 remastered versions I have aren't bad, and I still have all the original, so no loss here, anways, I'm blabbing, later
6302101743|4.0|The special effects carry this fun color B-flik from early on (though arguably not early enough) to the end. <br /> <br />I've gotta criticize some things though...  The script was only occassionally inspired.  The lighting was too often too dark.  why do that to our straining eyes, Mr. Director?  no need for the dusk scenes!  Many potentially interesting personality clashes, but those conflicts never seemed to impress me...  ho-hum...  and some scenes were just too long, without enough going on.   <br /> <br />The late scene clips of all of the sombraro-covered masses fleeing the stadium reminded me of the comic spoof-scene in Monty Python And The Holy Grail where that castle guard sees a guy perpetually running toward him.  Gosh, the last of those Mexican locals (and Mexico City it ain't) were forever still cramming into the exit tunnels.  unintented laughs!   <br /> <br />If you love seeing Marlboro guys whipping around on horses (over and over again), you'll go ga-ga over this late 60s entry. <br /> <br />and, sorry, but I have to critique the ending.  Out of the blue, the long last scene seems to be some sort of commentary on Roman Catholicism.  We see the protagonist-Rex big-butt his way into a bigger-on-the-inside-than-on-the-outside cathedral (so big and ornate it would make V-City drool).  As the masses rush in the front door and all instinctively rush out the back (I kid you not), the evil Rex gets locked in, and then gets burned to death, in a fire that burns the entire cathedral to the ground, though the attached building on either side remain unscathed.  and everyone stares in awe and disbelief.   um..... ok.... meaning?  not sure how to end a cowboy/dinosaur movie?  trying to give James Fran a way to not die in the end, as he did in Beneath The Planet Of The Apes?  is the \\"message\\" that these Catholicized Mexicans would be better off getting out of their church because evil resides in there, and is bound for the fires of hell???  if that isn't close tothe message, then what was the point?  no point?   <br /> <br />maybe our non-eaten couple could have been shown riding off toward the Wyoming sunset.

B000A6T1HC|5.0|I purchased this CD in anticipation of Bartoli's October performance at Zellerbach Hall (Berkeley).  Both live and on disc, Bartoli has reached a level of vocal agility, clarity, and emotional understanding unmatched in classical music today.  Now, before thinking this is just another review by a gushing fan, note that I have NOT historically been a Bartoli fan.  This was the result of being exposed to her CDs way back in the early 90s, when she was still in her mid 20s and yet to develop a command of voice and style that she has today.  At the time, I found her voice to be too mechanical, slightly shrill, and unmatched for the vocal range of the arias that she attempted.  Unfortunately, this caused me to not follow for career for much of a decade.  I instead held Renee Fleming in the highest esteem as the epitome of fine singing of the present day.  Thus, Bartoli's Vivaldi, Gluck, and Salieri recordings were not heard by me.   <br /> <br />A few months ago, I noticed that Bartoli was to give an \\"Opera Proibita\\" recital with Zurich Orchestra La Scintilla at Berkeley.  I decided on a whim to fight for tickets (and quite a battle it was, considering the performance sold out in a matter of hours) since \\"for whatever reason\\" Bartoli was a hot ticket item.  In preparation for thsi performance, I decided to familiarize myself with the style of music and singing that I would hear.   <br /> <br />I purchased this CD, and was immediately floored by the juxtaposition of vocal pyrotechnics with soft lyrical phrasing that seems to float to the heavens.  Bartoli's coloratura runs, which before seemed \\"hammering,\\" have matured into a buoyant and completely effortless technique, without sacrificing any agility of pitch.  Bartoli's ability in this regard is otherworldly.  My favorites on this disc to listen to are \\"Lascia la spina\\" and \\"Un pensiero nemico di pace,\\" because I'm a softie for the slow lyrical songs that most truly reflect Bartoli's \\"voice of 1000 colors.\\"  \\"Ecco negl'orti tuoi...Che dolce simpatica\\" is a cute and fun song.   <br /> <br />For those of you who think I shun her more dynamic pieces, I've come to appreciate them just as much after attending the Zellerbach performance, in which Bartoli sang about 90% of the songs on this disc.  Seeing her live...the way she connects to the orchestra and the audience...draws them in, wins them over, and makes a crowd of 2000 adults a consortium of raving screaming maniacal fanatics for her voice underscores the power of persuasion embodied in her singing and personality.  This woman has a lung capacity that is beyond human!  Audience members literally started laughing as she tackled particularly long coloratura runs...she kept going and going and going...without having to take a single breath.  You'll hear these same songs on this CD, and I recommend you try to imagine her singing these in person to truly grasp the full effect of their brillance.  By the way, she also sang \\"Lascia la spina,\\" and I was nearly in tears.  In all my years of attending musical performances, that's the first time something like that has ever happened.  Says something about a voice that can reduce a grown man to a puddle of emotions.   <br /> <br />So yeah, I'm sold on Bartoli.  I'm now going to backtrack and explore the decade that I missed.  For those of you considering this album, please...do NOT miss out on the phenomenon of Bartoli, better than ever.

It's definatly something different but if you give it a chance you won't be able to stop listening.
B000005RFQ|3.0|Review no. 105. Originally released in 1983, this was the band's only album with Deep Purple frontman Ian Gillan. I know several old school Sabbath fans that praise that fact. Personally, I never thought this was a bad effort. I remember hearing something about their American tour in support of this album. Something about how on the first leg, that Gillan was a bloody madman onstage every night. Then on the second leg, he was like totally bored out of mind, merely going through the moves. Apparently, this wasn't a combination that was meant to be. Tracks I always like hearing whenever I have the time to pull this CD out of the closet to give a spin every now and again were &#34;Trashed&#34; (still see the video on VH1 Classic Metal Mania from time to time), &#34;Disturbing The Priest&#34;, &#34;Zero The Hero&#34;, &#34;Digital Bitch&#34; and the title cut &#34;Born Again&#34;. Many don't think of this lp as a classic - but I liked it.
B00005T7I1|4.0|The movie was okay.The soundtrack and special effects were fantastic.Al Pacino as \\"Big Boy Caprice\\"was very good.My only problem was the villians didn't get more exposure,and Michelle Pfeiffer should had gotten the role as Breathless Mahoney.Also,the movie should had have more storyline from the comic strip series.But overall,I still give it a passing grade.
0446310786|5.0|are there still people on the planet who haven't read this one?  if so, we need to change that!  this is my absolute favorite book of all time.  i believe it should be required reading for the human race.  it touches on so many human experiences: racism, fear, truth, coming of age, the south, families, friendship (i could go on).  yet lee manages to keep the story clean and flowing.  scout is the perfect main character; she is innocent, young and a bit naive.  this results in the reader know more than she does.  yet her story is so wonderfully told.  i re-read this book about once every 2 years and i fall in love with it each time.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Serenity as most of you know is based off of the short lived, but never forgotten Firefly series written by Joss Whedon (Angel, Buffy). Serenity takes you into a western-sci-fi world that is so imaginative and not revolving around aliens at all! For those of you who haven't seen the show, you will still enjoy it for some great action, intersting story, great characters and some really funny lines. Firefly fans though will get more out of it. It's just the nature of the beast. If you have the chance to see the show, or even a few episodes before you see the movie, the better. The way to story unfolds is very nice and very well paced. Many scenes will have you at the edge of your seat due to great writing and storytelling by Joss Whedon. The movie may not be a non-stop laugh riot, but the humor is used at the exat right times. Right when things look like things are at their worst, one of the characters will say a line that will relieve the tension even just for a bit. After the series of Star Wars prequels that just barely satisfied us Star Wars fans, Serenity comes around and gives you actual characters that you care for. George could learn a thing or two from Joss. The film will no doubt be a cult classic, but hopefully if enough normal people who haven't seen the series go, we just might have a franchise. Please, if you have the chance, go see Serenity. YOu should hopefully be able to pick out something that you will like.<br /><br />~Can't Stop The Signal~
B000002TQV|5.0|First I got say that my favorite radiohead song is on this album and that song is HIGH AND DRY!!!! Other great songs include in order of best song are Fake plastic trees, Just, Planet Telex, Black star, Bullet Proof I wish I was My iron lung, Sulk, Street Spirit, The Bends and i really didn't like any of the other tracks that much. A lot of people here say that Ok computer was their best album and I couldn't agree more especially with songs like Airbag, Karma Police, Let Down, Lucky and my 2nd favorite RADIOHEAD song right after HIGH AND DRY, PARANIOD ANDRIOD!!!!!
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I've been a fan since Facts, and this is the first DCFC album that has really disappointed me.  I understand that bands have to grow and evolve, but this albums is a real step backwards for them.  I just don't dig how it's so mellow and lacking energy.  Listen to Airplanes or Facts and you can see how real and inventive DCFC can be.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Brilliant.  I have been completely addicted to this album since I bought it, and I can't seem to go a day without listening to it.  You'll find that each song undergoes a change as you listen to it, making the album unpredictable and interesting.  This band has a creative intellect that shines in the music and lyrics.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This album is a really great buy for fans of Death Cab.  The lyrics once again are very well thought out, and very well written.<br /><br />If you're a fan of these guys then I totally recommend you buy it.
0785814531|5.0|All of Edgar Allan Poe's works collected into one hardcover volume. This book has a lot of stuff in it, and I still haven't quite finished it.  <br />   I guess what sets this book apart from all the other collections of Poe, is the book itself. It's not annotated, but I couldn't find any collections of Poe that were; however, it does come with a great introduction. And after that, pure Poe. The book is very sturdy, and considering it's price, a great bargain. I personally can't stand the see-saw cut pages that a lot collections like this get, but this book lacks those, and that makes me happy. I also won't waste your time trying to convince how great Poe was, since the fact that you're browsing here means you already know, or at least have a clue. <br />   While any collected Poe book would probably suit you just fine, since there is very little to distinguish them from each other, I would recommend this one, simply because when I was browsing through the various collections, this one appeared to be the best bang for my buck.
B000002TP7|5.0|This album is like Check Your Head, my personal favorite album of all time. This is so similar, even the CD art is the same, just a different color. The instrumentals here are hit or miss. The rapping, like always with the B Boys, is great. Then there are the rock songs. Everyone already loves Sabotage, but there are a few other good ones. <br />Best rapping tracks: <br />Sure Shot <br />Root Down <br />Get It Together <br />Do It <br /> <br />Best intstrumentals: <br />Robo on the Corner <br />Futterman's Rule (excellent!) <br /> <br />Best rock songs: <br />Sabotage <br />Tough Guy <br />Heart Attack Man <br /> <br />You can't miss this CD! Buy it!
B00082IJ08|5.0|Gorillaz's Demon Days album is only the second album of the side project band that went platinum with their self-titled debut album in 2000. Demon Days is a great follow up to an extremely successful first album, creating much anticipation and expectations. Many say Demon Days has fallen slightly short of those expectations, yet it is extremely popular. The first radio release \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" topped the charts for several weeks; the second single, \\"Dare\\", released after the release of the album has not done as well even though it is better. Demon Days in general has a similar sound but in many ways different sound. In their debut album the Gorillaz use a very strong rhythm at the beginning of each song, in Demon Days they have tended to integrate the rhythm slowly into a more flowing intro to each song. <br /> \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" starts out with an obscene laughing, which gives the impression of a song that is going to be funny, but then it starts talking about love. \\"...love for ever love is free...\\" This song also has more of flowing feeling to it although it does have a drum beat in it, the techno part in it make it flow very well. Then towards the end of the song, you can hear an acoustic guitar come into the song, which sounds great. \\"Dare\\" is a very innovative song because, it is not one of the Gorillaz singing, it is a guest singer. It mixes a very subtle amount of rock with quite a bit of techno. <br /> Mainly the lyrics are about love, and or death you can tell that just by some of the titles, like \\"Kids with Guns\\", \\"Last Living Souls\\", \\"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\\", \\"White Light\\", and \\"Don't Get Lost in Heaven\\". Death seems to be a very dominant subject in this album, unlike the first album, which supposedly has to do with drugs although they do not come out and say it, they hid their meaning in the lyrics. <br /> I am a drawn to this music because I love techno music, and I am a huge rock fan. Gorillaz bring a good mixture of the both to the table, a little more on the techno side but that is why it appeals so much to me personally. Gorillaz is great band because they hid their identities and you really do not know what the real people behind the characters of Murdoc, 2-D, Russel, Noodle. <br /> The closest group that matches the Gorillaz that I could imagine is Linkin Park, which also mixes rock, and techno, just Linkin Park mixes very hard rock with just a slight bit of techno in the background. This is really the only group that could even come close, not many bands attempt, to mix rock with techno or vice-versa.

B000002J2B|5.0|Soaring Phil Collins vocals, swirling Tony Banks' mellotrons and achingly tender piano touches , slashingly-tasteful Steve Hackett guitar riffs, and the under-rated melodic backbone of Mike Rutherford's bass combine to produce the most timeless work of Genesis' studio career. As an enthusiastic prog-rocker who lived and loved the fruits that the 70's provided to this genre, I've enjoyed perhaps hundreds of listening experiences of this ablum.  It's always interesting and hummable if not bang-on-the-desk and finger-tapping. Buy \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" and the live \\"Seconds Out\\" and know that you own the very best Genesis creations.  Add \\"Trick of the Tale\\", \\"Invisible Touch\\", and \\"...And Then There Were Three\\" to flesh-out your Genesis catalogue.  \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" remains their most stylish effort.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Franz Ferdinand's sophomore effort, \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" reminds me of of Blur's \\"The Great Escape\\" following their masterpiece \\"Parklife\\". I'm not comparing the albums or bands directly, but they are alike in that their followups use the same formula as their predecessor, but stretches out and expands on it. And this is exactly what Franz does. Do not come in here frightened or expecting a challenging album, because this is their debut, only dirtier, extended, and with better production.    The album's first single, \\"Do You Want To\\", makes this clear, when right after a familiar intro, it bursts into a trippy upbeat rocker with keyboards flying everywhere. The album is full of the same homoerotic pop stompers that the debut had, so in that sense the band are cornering themselves into a position, but at this moment, both the band and the audience are benefiting from that position.    The slower numbers, like \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" and the Beatlesque \\"Fade Together\\", are in great contrast to the faster, dirtier material, like \\"Evil and a Heathen\\", \\"The Fallen\\", and \\"Outsiders\\". The best part is, those who were frustrated by the debut's somewhat repetitive production will be enthralled here, because the production is in tip top shape and it keeps the pacing fresh.    Lyrically, the album has some funny and lewd stuff that will please --even if they almost step into the territory of self-parody-- and Kapranos' vocals also fit nicely in with the new production. It seems to blend a lot more with the melodies than in the debut, especially in the songs \\"This Boy\\", and \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\".    Basically, come here expecting a few twists to the same ol' formula, but regardless, there's a lot of good material here, and you'll definitely have fun. I'll be looking to see what Franz does from here.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|<br />There is no doubt that batman begins is better than those funny movies called batman forever(which wasnt that bad),and the last movie of the old series;Batman&Robin(which,  with the porn-star smile of george colony and the batmobil with pink light;one of the worst movies i've ever saw.) <br /> <br />But what surprised me was;This Movie is EVEN BETTER THAN TM BURTON'S Batman movies!!Let's face it,Tim burton is a man with great talent,but he was more interested in telling fairy tales then the real dark story of batman,and he lacked the talent to make a fast,spinning,dark action movie.Batman 1 and 2 was good but they were so slow,so disconnected;especially the second one. <br /> <br />i'm not a fan of batman comics,i've hardly completed reading an issue or two.and i wasnt a fan of batman either.Since i watched batman begins.. <br /> <br />This batman movie is no kid movie like the previous ones.this time it tells a real,noir story.it is dark and edgy.it doesnt have a catchy main theme,instead it has a dark score almost like a horror movie,which perfectly fits in telling the story of the character.The script is a masterpiece.Every word,every item you hear and see in the movie has a purpose,nothing is a waste of time and everything comes back in the right place as they should be.The directing is as great as the sceneriowriting and the music.i mean;even KATE HOLMES acts good!!C.Bale is the best batman ever,his voice,his standing,a perfect fit.With the great team work of the actor and the director,they not only tell the ongoing story,but also focus into the character's own soul as well.The only thing bad about the movie is that;you cant see \\"batman\\"in the first half;which is possibly a bad thing for many people who want to see batman,but for me it worked fine;the wait made the plessure higher. <br /> <br />i'm telling you,this is with no doubt the best batman movie,and there is more;this is the best comic book movie made so far,it is as dark as blade runner or sincity,as entertaining as spider man 2,as professional as Hulk movie. <br /> <br />Buy this movie,and dont listen to those kids who didnt like this movie,who yearn to see batman as a dark spider man who jumps over the roofs and beats a dozen of thugs,jump to his fascinating sports car and act in cartoon logic.you dont have to be a fan of batman,i'm not and i dont care,this is a great movie,and i cant wait to see the squel.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BKJ78U|1.0|First he deliberately keeps quiet about the changes to last years set, now he's trying to outright trick us- these are the very same 2004 destroyed editions from last year, but with the original theatrical poster art. a lot more unknowing people will be dupped.  <br /> <br />Being a Christian, there are somethings about Lucas I can't say here. <br />
B00065EB2M|5.0|An incredible six DVD set encompassing the last manned flight to the moon in December, 1972. Mark Gray's Spacecraft Films has realized a dream for many Apollo Freaks that have wanted the best quality footage and video availiable of America's early space missions. Previously released bootleg videos of the Apollo moonwalks were copied from grainy film kinescopes, not the master videotapes. For this new set, Spacecraft Films made sure that nearly all of the lunar EVA video had been digitally enhanced and remastered from the master two-inch videotape reels that were stored at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. This results in that \\"live as it happened\\" look that only original master videotape can give you. Bravo, Spacecraft Films!
B000B0WODA|5.0|I'm a big time fan and this new cd of theirs did enough to quench my need for the Franz!!! ^.^ All of the tracks sound really fresh and new and they're still sticking to their fun retro like rock n' roll. Their first single, Do You Want To was enough to make me wanna dance my booty off! If you liked their first album you are bound to love this one just as much...if not more!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't watch much TV anymore, there's just not a lot out there I find interesting.  But I have been a Joss Whedon fan since the first season of Buffy.  And you know what?  Even I didn't watch Firefly when it came out on Fox.  I saw about 15 minutes of it and thought, enh.  Then the series came out on DVD, Serenity was being made into a movie, and I thought I'd give it another chance.  I'm so glad I did.  There are some great episodes here, and they're (gasp!) in order -- Fox originally showed the second episode first for some reason, it kept getting pre-empted and moved around so it never really found a home.<br /><br />The pilot is a wonderful introduction to the series, but one of the best episodes, Out of Gas, also serves as a good introduction.  Just watch it, you'll see.<br /><br />Also I'd recommend watching the bonus features at the end (and I never watch those).  This was how I finally understood why all the characters just randomly burst into Chinese phrases.  Apparently Joss's version of the future makes note of the fact that the US and China are the two major superpowers, so naturally  everyone would be sprinkling Mandarin Chinese into their everyday speech.  This is never really explained in the series, and once I understood that, I just thought it was brilliant.<br /><br />Of course, I think everyone should be a Joss Whedon fan, but let's face it, then what would those of us who are have to feel superior about?
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I wish everyone would just shut up about how A7X got rid of the screaming because of the burst blood vessel in Shadow's throat.  He said him self that the blood vessel broke around two years ago and it had nothing to do with the absence of screaming on City Of Evil.  They just decided to go a new way.  They almost got rid of the screaming on Waking the Fallen but they were afraid they would loose too many fans.  I am not making this up.  You can even check by going to Vh1.com or go to wakingthefallen.com and listen to their interview on love line.  Anyways, I love it when M. Shadows screams but this new cd is just great and doesn't need it.  If at first you don't like it, just keep listening to it.  It'll grow on you, trust me and eventually you'll totally forget that Avenged Sevenfold ever even screamed in the first place.  Biatch
0156907399|1.0|I agree with Jon Pike and C. Thomas below (other reviewers).  I certainly agree that someone needs to end the farce that Virginia Woolf is a good writer.  Her work, to me, is neither thought-provoking nor well-written.  I was really disappointed with this \\"work\\" and actually threw my copy into a box headed for Goodwill (not really good will to pass it on, but I had to get it out of my house)...and I never give away books.  Let's stop pretending folks...
B000065V3H|5.0|This movie reminds J-Abs of high school.  You may be saying J-Abs were you picked on like this in high school.  Did someone throw flaming bags of poo at your door.  Heck no loser.  J-Abs was ten times cooler than the cool jocks in this movie.  Heck J-Abs invented delivering pizza to hot women and making them want extra anchovies.  To even think J-Abs was Ronald McDonald should be grounds for an immediate butt kicking, but J-abs is feeling nice today so he will let you read the rest of this review.  So anyway Ronald Miller is this ultra cool guy who likes this nerdy chick and decides that out of the goodness of his heart he will make her cool by hanging out with her.  You know what, this movie was based on J-Abs life story.  I have seen no royalities on this.  This review is done until I gets paid.  J-Abs out!
0451526295|5.0|This is Jane Austen forey into more serious literature, and many of her faithful fans dislike it because of Fanny's, the main character, lack of romance. I beleive it may be one of Jane Austen's best novels. It is a more clear and accurate portrayal of the sensibilities of the time. It goes more into human nature especially about the heart and why people fall in love.<br /><br />It is a simple story about a girl ,Fanny, who is taken in by her rich Aunt and Uncle. Fanny is an incredibly nervous person. Only her cousin Edmund can make her feel at home. She is raised very properly, although stiltedly because her uncle wants to be sure she realizes she is below their family. The entire family grows dependent on her. Fanny falls in love with Edmund who falls in love with another. I won't ruin anymore of the story. Read it!
B00004XONN|5.0|When I was in high school, I bought Radiohead's first album, \\"Pablo Honey,\\" because I liked the popular song \\"Creep.\\"  I listened to it for a while, eventually sold it for cash, and then didn't think about them for years.  I was more into Wilco and Soltero and Manitoba.<br /><br />Then, my brother bought this album, \\"Kid A,\\" and left it behind when he moved to Africa.  I put it in my CD player two weeks ago, and it's never left since.  What a great album.  What an amazing band.<br /><br />Their beats never match their music in any conventional way, their lyrics are usually unintelligible (yet melodious), and their songs never head where you would think they should.  They defy every expectation, and with ever listen they grow better and better.<br /><br />In one song, a saxophone comes out of nowhere, and what was almost an industrial exploration of sonic atmosphere becomes joyfully angry experimental jazz.  In another, a disco beat explodes from an almost techno drone.  Stacatto drums tattoo beds of electronic shimmer.  Synthesized noises mate frantically with jagged guitar lines.  The vocals lay down hypnotic yet urgent command after command, and at times all the music feels as if it's sliding sidewise and about to vanish forever.<br /><br />IT ROCKS.<br /><br />What a great album.<br /><br />Everyone tells me \\"O.K. Computer\\" is even better, and if that's true, I'm buying everything this band's ever recorded.<br /><br />...And you should buy THIS.
B00005JO0J|5.0|The space ship Serenity is a place of refuge for River (Glau) and her brother Simon (Maher).  River is a young telepath whose life is being manipulated by the Alliance.  Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Fillion) has been working against the Alliance for a while now, and despite his gruff exterior, he is actually a nice guy.  Taking River and Simon on board is not a problem until Simon begins to question the captain's orders and River begins to show some mental instability.  Add to that their pursuit by an Alliance operative (Ejiofor), and the crew of the Serenity has their hands full.<br /><br />\\"Serenity\\" is the rebirth of the cancelled TV series \\"Firefly\\".  I have never gotten into \\"Firefly\\", despite numerous attempts, so I consider myself new to the \\"Serenity\\" universe.  While the TV show never engaged me, \\"Serenity\\" was the exact opposite.  Filled with action, science fiction, and humor, \\"Serenity\\" is a highly entertaining movie experience.<br /><br />Joss Whedon, creator and first-time director, has crafted a highly entertaining tale that can be enjoyed by \\"Firefly\\" fans and newcomers alike.  With a cast of no-names, Whedon has crafted a tale that is reminisent of the first \\"Star Wars\\" film.  And, while there is closure at the end of the film, there are still possibilities that are left to be explored.  I, for one, hope that we will see the spaceship Serenity again.
B00005JL1C|5.0|How can one not like the arrogance of one Mr. Hardy Jens.  That's right he is Mr. Hardy Jens to you.  The best part is when he makes Keith change his oil in that sweet vette.  He was all like \\"Change my oil you dipstick\\".  \\"I'm Hardy Jens and I am better than you and have Ms. Amanda Jones on my arm.  You are a loser who hangs out with a drumma.  I'm a drumma I can't lose my arm\\"  This reminds J-Abs of the time he hung out with Rick Allen after the 1988 Def Leppard/Oaktown 3-5-7 tour and Rick was all like in his British accent \\"What is it like to live around all these art geeks in the states?\\"  J-Abs was like \\"I like to push them into lockers b/c that is what makes me rule\\"  Yes it is hard to be in the same orbit of coolness with one Mr. J-Abs.  Anyway this movie is the best and when Jens turns the water on Duncan at the Halloween party and then is chased by the horse and carriage is totally intense.  JAbs rules!!!!
B0000AFQS0|5.0|This Special Edition actually deserves the title . <br />The film itself is worth the price and really the producers would have to be pretty stupid to get it wrong .  <br />Really , nothing extra is required , but if they are going to provide us with supplements they may as well make an effort . <br /> <br />The visual nature of the package and the booklet is very good and will please any Who fan . <br /> <br />The commentary by the director is pretty terrible . <br />What a shame they didn't get Roger and Pete in to do one . <br />Roger is newly interviewed in the extras section , so why wasn't he asked ? Maybe he felt the music should do the talking , which is fair enough . He comes across as someone who wants to get on with performing honestly and he does that very well .   <br /> <br />The band had it all - great voices , memorable songs , power , showmanship and were unique musicians with their own very distinctive styles , plus a sense of humor which I always liked . Their humor reminds me of the Beatles press conferences . <br /> <br />Most bands nowadays would have to have a joke scripted for them and passed by the politically correct police so as not to potentially upset a demographic . <br /> <br />Watch and remember what rock used to be . <br />Revel in this release - I certainly have . <br />This is not merely music , it is multi layered entertainment .

B00000DQSZ|4.0|On a historical level, Trans-Europe Express is the Sgt. Pepper of techno music. There are better techno albums; surely Moby's Everything is Wrong and Chemical Brothers' Dig Your Own Hole are more consistent and hypnotic. But when it comes to pioneering old-school trance music, this is the granddaddy of them all. If you like fast-paced hardcore techno only, then this is not the album for you. If you want to open your mind to German \\"teutronic\\" trance, this is the place to start. I give it four stars because all the songs are good, but only two are groundbreaking: \\"Hall of Mirrors\\" and \\"Metal on Metal\\". \\"Hall of Mirrors\\" is a hypnotic walk into the pitfall of insecurity and vanity. The \\"clank,clank\\" noise of a person walking is a brilliant touch; it adds to the chill and imagery of the song. \\"Even the greatest stars/live their lives in the looking glass\\" is a disturbing lyric that sends shivers down my spine. At first, \\"Metal on Metal\\" sounds annoying; the \\"clank,boom,boom,clank\\" sound is a bit much. But through repetitive plays, this song sounds original and fresh. It remains a tour-de-force of experimentation and intensity. Overall though, the album is slightly overrated.
0307276902|1.0|This was recommened to J-Abs b/c of his ultra hip cool profile (don't even try to top it-yeah I'm talking to you loser).  Oprah talks about a million little pieces but J-Abs is not sure of what.  J-Abs didn't know  that the O wrote books but appartantly she he wrote like 1,236 books and is still going strong.  I'm glad she like a million little pieces cause J-Abs does as well.  J-Abs likes when some chump tries to match him move for move on the street corner in a Breakdance showdown.  After J-Abs does the worm for 25 minutes the chump usually breaks intoa million pieces.  Go J-Abs, go J-Abs go!!!
0142800031|5.0|i really enjoyed this novel. it was suspenseful right to the end. seems to be a renewed interest in World War II for both authors and readers, for good reason. we cannot know how to protect our future unless we know what happened in the past, and the author weaves some history of the French Resistance and English underground assistance, Gestapo torture tactics into this intrigueing novel. Some outcomes you figure too good to be true, but that's what makes it a good read. 5 stars from me.

6300216268|5.0|i watched this for the first time the other night and am sorry that i waited so long as it is a great film,one that all those who love movies and open-minds alike should see.i've liked ruth gordon in everything that i've ever seen her in and bet that she was a fun person to know in real life.as for bud cort,i can't say that i've ever seen him in anything else but was he great.this is a dark comedy unlike any other film that i've seen.sure the graduate comes to mind but still this is quite different.it's one of those films that you have to see for yourself to see what all the fuss is about.i'd have to say that this is one of the best films ever made and definitely deserves all the attention it gets.
B0007XT87G|5.0|if you don't know by now, PORCUPINE TREE is a fabulous progressive rock band that's takes some of the hipper elements of progressive rock giants of years past and adds modern-sounding instrumentation and production value, and does things to appeal to the listener on a more personal level.  this is a band that- though they retain their core sound from album to album- continue to push forward, for better or for worse.  _deadwing_ is an album that continues to perform reconaissance on territories seen from its predecessor _in absentia_, moving further towards more riff-oriented rock, while complicating its sound with thickened soundscapes, rich vocal harmonies, and heavy guitar distortion.  _deadwing_ to me is clear evidence as to why so many metalheads are into PORCUPINE TREE.  this is hands-down the heaviest PT album to date.  and perhaps their most challenging too.  it actually took me a while to get into this one.  gone are the crystal polish and radio-ready blockbusters on _in absentia_.  instead we have a darker, denser, murkier-sounding record that i think- in the end- is slightly more rewarding.  also, we find PT adding a significant amount of tension to their music, in the form of more riff-oriented songs that sound simultaneously frenetic and hypnotic.  this is a formula that i've really come to enjoy... just when it sounds like they might have overdone it with the amount of tension buried in these grooves, PORCUPINE TREE will suddenly explode into some lush, atmospheric passage that is the musical equivalent of firing off a hefty-sized wad- that nicely frees-up all that tension and leaves you kind of bobbing your head at the sheer magnitude of this band's sound and vision.  songs run the gamut in length, ranging anywhere from 3+ minutes- as on the beautiful, country-tinged \\"lazarus\\"- to the album's 13-minute center-piece, \\"arriving somewhere but not here.\\"  and so _deadwing_ feels at times like a collection of album-oriented songs, though each song is distinct and capable of standing on its own.  my only beef with this collection is the decision to forego including the tracks \\"so-called friend\\" and \\"half-life\\" on the american version, which i would have easily preferred over the rehashing of \\"shesmovedon\\" from the _lightbulb sun_ album.  these tracks are very good- album-quality even- and are definitely worth scrounging up somewhere.  also, i don't really see the point in the long block of silence following \\"glass arm shattering.\\"  other than that, _deadwing_ is a great album and a critical purchase in my opinion.ct and capable of standing on its own.  my only beef with this collection is the decision to forego including the tracks \\"so-called friend\\" and \\"half-life\\" on the american version, which i would have easily preferred over the rehashing of \\"shesmovedon\\" from the _lightbulb sun_ album.  these tracks are very good- album-quality even- and are definitely worth scrounging up somewhere.  also, i don't really see the point in the long block of silence following \\"glass arm shattering.\\"  other than that, _deadwing_ is a great album and a critical purchase in my opinion.
B00005JLH3|5.0|Great love story, I just want to watch over and over. There is a execellent story, cleaning people's brains. I can't believe that Jim carrey was this good in Etenral sunshine of the spotless mind. You should really watch this movie, It is really good, and if you like this movie you should also see garden state. Which really good, However I can't talk about Garden  <br />State because this is not a review about garden state. Check out my garden state review!! Clenatine is a really actor and is very good in this movie <br /> <br />WATCH >>>>>>> WATCH >>>>>>> WATCH >>>>>>> DRUMLINE
B00030590I|2.0|SKY like FLYING SNOW on your sleepy head! an old chinese proverb. this movie is boring, ridiculous and sleep inducing. it may be a chinese cure for insomnia except you'll probably be tired again an hour after you wake up. and i thought hollywood movies were bad. chinese movies are worse. much worse. maybe indian movies are better. yeah sure. oh well, i also ordered rob zombie's \\"house of a 1000 corpses\\". maybe that's good.  p.s.  always remember the very honorable story of the (chinese) emperor's new clothes and look for what's really there, not what some pompous jackass tells you is there. and may the QIN be with you.
B00003CXAT|4.0|Here's a great movie directed by the fabulous Steven Spielberg.  I remember very well the first time i saw this film, at a local cinema in 1993. It was a chilling experience. The very first time CGI-real-looking-characters (the dinosaurs) were used on screen. How exciting! As a kid, i was truly thrilled.  Today, i still enjoy the movie very much and consider it to be the best of the franchise (the second film being too dark and the third too light).  The present DVD is actually quite good, though the extras are a bit disappointing. But the adventures of Doctor Grant (Sam Neill is very good), Doctor Sattler and the kids are worth bying this.  Besides, who can resist Richard Attenborough saying : \\"Doctor Grant, my dear doctor Sattler, Welcome to Jurassic Park!\\" ?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Bought this when it first came out AFTER I borrowed AND watched a fellow Buffy fan's set.  I'll probably buy another to give to friend as a convalescent present.  Have been lending my set out to as many friends as I can in order to hook them to the series and hopefully thus GET A SEQUEL!!!!  The sale of this DVD set is/was one of the reasons Joss Whedon was able to get the Serenity movie made.  Spread the word and open your wallets if you want to see this franchise survive. <br /> <br />Funny story, I was on a business trip and had the DVDs in my luggage.  At customs the line-backer type inspector saw the DVDs in my luggage, smiled, and gave me a thumbs up.  You can never tell who is a Browncoat.
0143057693|3.0|bland and no action compared to all the many others I have from Cussler! This is interesting and follows his pattern of world doom and Numa save! It is just NOT a worthwhile buy! Save your money and rent or get it at your library. It is like going to a movie and wondering why you spent the money!
0399152717|3.0|Polar Shift, the sixth installment in the NUMA series, is another fantasy story of good versus evil, with the usual predecessor event setting the stage for an eventual tie-in to the main story.  In this case, Cussler pits Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala against a megalomaniac in collusion with a group of anti-globalization zealots.  Although perhaps not as compelling as previous works, Cussler and Kemprecos nonetheless serve up the usual fodder where Kurt and Joe again fight tremendous odds and calmly face down death repeatedly as they battle the antagonists.  Long-time fans will likely find Polar shift to be good, but definitely not great.
B000050XEI|5.0|This CD has the amazing power of an astounding voice blended with beautiful sounds of other instruments to create a superior sound that captivates the listener.  The lyrics are magical and luring filled with strong emotions and expressive feelings of romance.  The Heavenly sound helps anyone to escape to a magical world of relaxation and peace with the most soothing voice imaginable. No other group or singer compares to Enya's ability to combine her smooth sounding voice with the other attributes of the song to create such an astounding and remarkable piece of music places her above most other performers.  She brings romance and hope to the hearts of all those willing to open their minds to the worlds she so beautifully paints.
B00005J6T0|5.0|This phenomenal disc has been descibed as the \\"perfect\\" pop album since it's release nearly 20 years ago. And it rightfully lives up to that glory. Absolutely no filler on the disc, which plagued the Madonna and Like A Virgin discs, this album is simply marvelous. Unreleased tunes such as \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" and \\"White Heat\\" are still extraordinary that most 80s stars would have killed to have those tracks on their albums. The mega-hits/classics include \\"Papa\\" \\"Open Your Heart\\" \\"Live To Tell\\" and \\"Bonita.\\" \\"La Isla Bonita\\" began the tradition of Madonna including a Spanish-style song on each of her subsequent albums: \\"Spanish Eyes\\" (Like A Prayer), \\"Going Bananas\\" (Breathless), \\"Love Tried To Welcome Me\\" (Bedtime Stories) etc...<br /><br />*Fun trivia: An original incarnation of \\"Open Your Heart\\" was first given to Cyndi Lauper (Madonna's contemporary rival at the time) and she flat out refused it saying it was not a good song. Madonna jumped on it and reworked the sounds/lyrics and took it straight to #1 whereas Lauper's career began to sputter and burn out.
1592400876|5.0|This book was recommended by several people.  As a writer who earns my money from the English language placed on paper, Eats, Shoots & Leaves is not only helpful but presented in an amusing way.  However, I have not read it as one would read a novel or book of that kind.  I am using it more as a reference resource and happy to do so. No doubt significant enjoyment could be derived from reading it cover to cover.  I am a reader as well as a writer and my read load is enormous.  So many books, so little time.  That was not an original statement which I'm sure most of you know.
B00004T9UF|5.0|this is eminem at his best, this is who he is, this is the greatest album ever. this is better than all his other albums, even the ones that came after. Eminems sick and twisted style is fun to listen to because he is offensive, and every1 he disses deserved it!!!, there will never be another album like this. while sick and twisted, it has some very meaningful songs. its a lot better than the slim shady lp, and i heard this one b4 i heard that one. if i heard the slim shady lp first, i would think eminem isn't great beat wise because it had great lyrics, just like this one, but with crummy beats. <br /> <br />i dont usually rate skits, but the PSA 2000 was just a great intro...10/10 <br /> <br />Kill You.....15/10...best opening ever <br /> <br />Stan...20/10 <br /> <br />Who Knew.....16/10 <br /> <br />The Way I Am.....20/10 <br /> <br />The Real Slim Shady....16/10 <br /> <br />Remember Me......9/10 <br /> <br />I'm Back.....11/10 <br /> <br />Marshall Mathers.....13/10 <br /> <br />Drug Ballad....10/10 <br /> <br />Amityville.....10/10 <br /> <br />Bitch Please II......14/10 <br /> <br />Kim....20/10 <br /> <br />Under The Influence....15/10 <br /> <br />Criminal....17/10 <br /> <br /> <br />-now, almost every song is rated even above the highest rating of 10...to show how great they are, so #'s above 10 i just chose randomly because theyre all good, i really dont have preference of songs over others here, unless they fall under 10...but if it is 20/10...those are the best songs. my lowest rating is 9/10, which means even the worst song here is great.....u get what i mean.....im just trying to say, this album is phenomenal both beat wise and lyrically
B00001W9G0|3.0|This film is yet another attempt by Hollywood to portray depression era communists as Idealistic or Indiana Jones type characters,not the schemeing Stalinists and ego maniacs that most were. Some idealistic young people did join Radical Left organizations, the sincere ones left when they saw the horrors of Stalin. Read HOLLYWOOD PARTY which goes into the history of this period in Hollywood and the Communist Party's role in the blacklist. The movie is only saved by Striesand's timeless song THEY WAY WE WERE.
