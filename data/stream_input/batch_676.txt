0679746323|3.0|This book may be the best ever written about Mao and the horrors he perpetrated on the Chinese people.  However, I found the book tiresome to read.  The authors make it clear in every section that the material is another example of how power hungry, ruthless and brutal Mao was in his mission to rule China.  The authors did not have to explicitly explain it time and time again.  The narrative brings home their points making the explicit statements unnecessary.   <br /> <br />As another reviewer commented, its not clear how Mao gains support of the masses of middle and lower level party members even as he has other murdered and tortured.  There must be some reason for his success in building a loyal following that would carry out his brutal orders. <br /> <br />I would not recommend it for a casual reader. <br /> <br />

0743496728|3.0|I just finished reading Nineteen Minutes this weekend and I have to say that I did not think it was nearly as good as most of the reviews here.  It was alright, and I will admit that I was interested enough to finish it in one weekend, but overall I have to say I was disappointed.    I was fascinated by the subject matter and really looking forward to reading a good book that \\"asks the simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you? What does it mean to be different in our society? Is it ever okay for a victim to strike back? And who -- if anyone -- has the right to judge someone else?\\"  Unfortunately, this book fell short of addrssing those questions in a meaningful way.       The problem with this book is that you cannot tell whether the author is trying to make a social commentary or whether she is simply trying to tell a story about the relationship between a mother and her daughter, and about the struggles of another mother whose child has gone terribly awry. Instead of delving into the difficult, controversial questions presented in the cover-flap, I mostly found page after page telling us the story of a mother trying to fix a broken relationship with her daughter, and of another mother simply saying \\"where did I go wrong\\" over and over again.  The book did touch on controversial issues, but in my opinion it did so in a superficial way.  In short, this book tried to do two things at once - address the deep social issues involved in a school shooting, and tell a deep story about the relationship between a mother and daughter.  Unfortunately it did neither of them well.  The author should have focused on one or the other.    I also have to agree that the \\"surprise ending\\" was completely unbelievable and almost ruined the entire book.  It added nothing whatsoever to the story, and by the time it was revealed, the book was essentially over anyway.  It felt like the author got to the end of the book and suddenly said \\"you know, I should put a surprising twist here that will shock people.\\"  As another reviewer mentioned, it was like she decided, in the last few pages, to try and make it like a James Patterson novel (or a Scoobie Doo episode - \\"it wasn't really Mr. Smith the hotel caretaker, it was Mr. Jones, the hotdog vendor\\").    I could have handled the disappointment in the subject of the book if the writing had been better, but it was mediocre at best.  A book can be about almost anything and if it is well written it will be a joy to read.  The writing in this book was adequate, but it in no way compensated for the flat storyline.    I do give this book three stars because it was interesting enough for me to read in one weekend (although I admit to skimming through some of the paragraphs - one can only read so many pages of \\"oh - woe is me - where did I go wrong?\\" before getting tired of it).  I think the author had a great idea and had a wonderful opportunity to write what could have been an important book - but she missed it.  A book like this should evoke strong emotions or force the reader to consider things from a different perspective.  But in this case the author appears to have simply relied on the horrifying nature of the subject matter itself to chill her readers, rather than stimulate the reader's mind by presenting a profound social insight or taking a controversial viewpoint.    Overall, it's a good book if you have nothing else on your to-read list, and it's worth a look if you don't set your expectations too high.  But readers looking for a \\"story-behind-the-story\\" about a school shooting may be disappointed to find that this book is largely about a mother-daughter relationship.  For me, it was worth taking the time to read, but if I had paid a lot of money for it instead of getting it from the library, I would have felt disappointed that I spent my money on it.

0790731479|5.0|Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as a very convincing couple with great chemistry), are dead. Now they can't leave their sprawling New England home. Good thing they've got the \\"Handbook for the Newly Deceased\\" to help guide them on their way through the beuracratic world of the dead.<br /><br />They've got a problem. A new living family (Cahterine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder) is inhabiting their house. Worse than that, they're remodeling the place. What's a pair of ghosts to do? When they can't scare them out, they call on the help of the famous Bio-Exorcist: Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton in his best role ever).<br /><br />What results is a mixture of dark comedy and sweet special effects (for the late 80's at least) set in front of stunningly imaginative and interesting scene design.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a classic, and if you haven't seen it yet, now's your chance. Since this is an old DVD there really aren't many special features. Just a lot of written \\"Notes\\" on the film, but even those are pretty cool.
3438052229|4.0|A clearly printed, well-bound version of the BHS. The main drawback, in exchange for the compact size compared with the full-size, hardback edition, is that the Masorah Parva notes in the margins and the footnotes are so small that they are very difficult to read. A magnifying glass is required to ease the eye strain. While the price for this edition is attractive, I wish I had purchased the full-size, hardback edition.
0316743003|4.0|This is a fast read with a limited NY Times-level vocabulary. It has several interesting details that allow readers familiar with the procurement of stealth technology by the US government to fill in blanks as to why certain events took place the way they did. It also describes the developing trends that killed the traditional skunk works. I ended up marking none of the pages, which tells me that there aren't any unexpected statements lurking in the book. I'm certainly appreciative of having read it once.

B000O1799U|3.0|I didn't dislike Dreamgirls, but I didn't love it either. It's just your typical been-done-before Hollywood film, only this time it's done with a big famous soundtrack and storyline. That only partly makes the film a success.<br /><br />The first hour or so of the film is dedicated to slowly revealing all the characters that we will be watching for the next 2+ hours. Danny Glover, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, and even Steve Urkle is in there for a second at the beginning (that's when you know they're pulling all the stops).<br /><br />Although there are some dazzling shots and some amazing singing performances, most of the acting is lackluster, except for Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy occasionally, though he's just playing the Eddie Murphy we've always seen. For some reason when he plays the same character in a dramatic film, it earns him an Oscar nomination. That speaks more to the low amount of respect given to comedic actors in comedies than to Eddie Murphy's acting. Jennifer Hudson is not an actress, except when she's singing. Maybe they should have invented a new category for her called \\"Best Supporting Singer\\" because during straight acting scenes she was stunningly blank and disappointing.<br /><br />The film itself drags quite a bit, even with the four or five montages used to show the singers' rise to the top. It all gets a bit repetitive and boring, although the second hour is much more exciting and entertaining than the first.<br /><br />Overall, like I said, it's not a bad movie, it's just not a good one. And it's definitely not a Best Picture contender... I don't know how that idea got sold to Academy Award nominators. Check it out if you love musicals or if you love watching pop-singers pretend to act in between singing and dancing. Other than that, it's not worth the time.
B000063DHL|3.0|Bruce's voice seemed a little shaky on this one, and the whole thing sounds kind of rushed.  Understand that I really like NOTB, POM, PS, and SSOSS, but this just kind of sits a bit below.  Pretty good instrumentals, as usual, but I really don't care about Alexander the Great, and the lyrics are so-so.  I was listening to IM and Killers back in the early 80's, so it's not like I'm not a Maiden fan (otherwise I wouldn't have spent so much $$ getting my old Maiden's on cds).  And I like a lot of songs since SIT, but mostly just 1-3 songs per cd. Buying a cd for that is just wasteful unless you're a collector.  This one's $14... I should have downloaded Wasted Years (one of my all-time favorites) and saved $13.  It's not fair to only be rated by IM fans that will rate 4-5 stars no matter what, so I must drop it down a notch.  Go ahead and rip on me if you must, but there's no real accounting for personal taste.  And at 3 stars, it's not like I don't enjoy it at all.

B000LE1GVW|4.0|Luckily I'd heard more of PN that just the 'new shoes' song before I bought this CD.  If you haven't, and you are thinking about getting this CD based on that song, I'd suggest you take a few minutes to roll through a few of the other songs at a listening station before you do.  It is definitely not a rockin' road tunes experience, but it is a lovely listen.<br /><br />I don't meant the cautionary paragraph above to suggest this is not a good CD, because it is.  His voice is absolutely beautiful, and I definitely like more than just the stuff you hear on the radio.  It really surprised me when I heard that he's only 19 or so.  I look forward to more interesting and complex things from this man as he matures as a person as an artist.  So all in all, a really good debut, with pretty songs, and more depth of voice and emotional tone than a 19 yr old has a right to show.  I definitely have to be in a mellow mood for this CD, unless it's on shuffle with a bunch of other CDs, but that isn't necessarily a knock, just commentary.  And may I mention again that this man has definitely got a voice on him?
B000NVIXFK|5.0|To start out, I will admit that I am a bit biased. I think Rush is the greatest band ever by a long shot, and I love nearly every one of their songs. On to the review...  I believe S&A is their best album since Counterparts. Test for Echo was decent and Vapor Trails was really good, but this one is even better. The album is mixed and mastered wonderfully (which is a lot more than you could say for Vapor Trails), Geddy's voice sounds wonderful, there is more acoustic guitar than in previous albums, and, needless to say, the drums, guitar, and bass are exceptional. Oh yah, and the songwriting isn't too shabby either.<br /><br />1. Far Cry - Awesome, rocking single.<br /><br />2. Armor and Sword - My favorite on the album. Just great harmonies and an all-around superb song.<br /><br />3. Workin' Them Angels - Another awesome song. This one really gets stuck in your head. Has a Working Man feel to it.<br /><br />4. The Larger Bowl - Beautiful harmonies. This one is the most poppy on the album. Very nice song with a Presto-like chorus.<br /><br />5. Spindrift - This is my least favorite track on the album.<br /><br />6. Main Monkey Business - This instrumental ROCKS! Not much else to say.<br /><br />7. The Way The Wind Blows - Beautiful song. I love the bluesy intro that transforms flawlessly into Rush's classic sound.<br /><br />8. Hope - Beautiful acousticy instrumental. Short, but sweet.<br /><br />9. Faithless - The lyrical content is like Ghost of a Chance. Love this song. The verses have a Hold Your Fire feel to them.<br /><br />10. Bravest Face - Really good song with powerful choruses.<br /><br />11. Good News First - At first, I really wasn't into this one. But the bridge is so melodious and beautiful that it basically salvages the whole song. Also, the bridge and solo are reminiscent of Counterparts.<br /><br />12. Malignant Narcissism - Another rocking instrumental. This one borrows the old drums and bass comping that we loved so much in YYZ.<br /><br />13. We Hold On - Great ending track.<br /><br />So, as you can see, I am very pleased with this album. It surpassed my expectations. Can't wait to see Rush live in Boston in June!! If you are even somewhat of a Rush fan, you will really enjoy this album. Go buy it!very pleased with this album. It surpassed my expectations. Can't wait to see Rush live in Boston in June!!

Read this book, if only to get your mental gears working more efficiently.  Faith in any dogma that is not rooted upon reality can be an impediment to personal psychological and spiritual health.  The individual must learn to think clearly, and to question long held beliefs about the world if they are to ever have a chance at creating a more conscious state of existence for themselves.

B00005JPAO|5.0|This really is a very good movie and I think Helen Mirren is wonderful in this performance.  Frankly, I prefer her portrayal of this Elizabeth to her fine performance of the first Elizabeth.  Of course, this is a more personal and private story and it is the intimacy without all the accoutrements of history that I enjoyed so much.<br /><br />I suppose it helps to have at least a passing understanding of the British system of government, its society, and the function of the Queen and the Royal Family.  If you are a thoroughgoing Republican (in their sense - that is anti-monarchist) you probably cannot work up much interest or sympathy for the Queen and much of what the movie offers will simply not be available to you.  So, I hope you can see her as a woman, a real person, who is in this position in her government and in history.  Notice how she came to the throne as a very young woman (only talked about, but not shown in the movie - but can be found on the BBC website).<br /><br />The story centers around the events of the coming to power of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as Prime Minster and the death of Princess Diana.  The Queen, being raised during more austere times, particularly the furnace of the Second World War, did not believe in public displays of emotion or grieving.  Add to that the fact the Diana was really no longer a member of the Royal Family when she died.  It was felt that her death was a private affair.  The Queen and her family are steeped in tradition and were following its protocols perfectly.  They in no way were intending to minimize or insult Diana's memory.  Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is quite supportive of tradition and the Queen, but seems quite oblivious to the world outside the grounds of Balmoral or the other palaces.<br /><br />What they did not appreciate was the way the public had taken Diana to its collective heart.  She was a celebrity even more than royalty and the public felt a loss that required the Queen to participate in a new way.  According to the movie, it was Tony Blair, with some help by Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), who played the key role in helping them understand this new requirement.  It was actually a new and heavier burden the public placed on the Royal Family, but the public did not and does not care.<br /><br />I especially liked the way Tony Blair grows in appreciation for Elizabeth and the way she fulfills her role.  The pressures of being Prime Minister almost certainly contributed to that appreciation.  A key scene is when his staff is bashing the Queen yet again and Blair has had enough and sets them straight about the appreciation they should have for her.<br /><br />The most touching scenes are when the Queen is driving her Land Rover around her estate wearing her royal scarf over her hair and being as close to a normal person as she can ever be.  Fascinating.  Another touching scene is her appearance outside the gate viewing the huge displays of flowers and notes the public left for Diana outside Buckingham Palace.  The Queen maintains her public dignity as she reads some very insulting remarks about her and her family, but we know how much this wounds her.<br /><br />The filmmakers have woven actual footage of the actual events into the movie itself and it is amazingly well done and does add to the sense of immediacy of the story.  Anyone who remembers the actual events will still be drawn in by the movie's Tony Blair talking within footage that is matched carefully to the surrounding actual footage contemporary to Diana's death.<br /><br />A very good movie and wonderfully worth seeing.w way.

0618918248|2.0|I wouldn't care to read a book about Republicans written by a Democrat, or a history of the Hatfields written by the McCoys. Such a book by an author filled with animosity toward his subject would tend to be biased hyperbole using only selective evidence that fits the main intention of hurting the enemy, and this is my problem with The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins. While reading this book I got the distinct impression that Dawkins abhors Christianity, and thus his work here is not so much a scientific, logical argument but more a sustained insult against religion and those who practice it, particularly Christians.     Dawkins states up front that he is focusing on the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism, he suggests, tend to be more \\"ethical philosophies of life\\" rather than religions. Thus he is free to ignore over half the world and focus on his primary target, Christianity. He does speak very gingerly of the evils of Islam but only when safely couched within stronger invective against Christians.  He apparently doesn't want to end up like his fellow atheist Theo Van Gogh who was murdered by a Muslim extremist for being critical of Islam. Christians are always a safe target, there being little chance of an attack by fanatical, bomb-throwing Presbyterians.    The author cites several examples of how Christians have made life in America a living hell for atheists, similar to what gays went through fifty years ago. Gays have protection now because they've banded together as a political force, but Dawkins laments that the poor atheists have no advocacy groups. He talks about a case where the U.S. Supreme Court showed its discriminatory bias toward religion by allowing a quasi-religious group in New Mexico to use hallucinogenic drugs during its worship service. Such drugs are illegal to the rest of us but because this was a religion, the Court allowed it on the basis of the First Amendment. This is not somuch a religious issue as it is a problem with the Court that bent over backwards to appease a minority group. I dare say that they would not have been as lenient with Rick Warren's Saddleback Church had those people decided to start smoking peyote during the invocation. And bear in mind that most of the federal judiciary are secular socialists who won't permit students to wear crosses or read the Bible at school.      Dawkins is under a few delusions of his own. He seems to think that Christian fundamentalists wield extraordinary political power in the U.S. and are poised and ready to take over the government at any moment. Where does he get this ludicrous notion? He either doesn't understand American politics or else he is deliberately misrepresenting Americans as religious nuts in order to make his case that Christianity is the root of all evil. Throughout the book the examples he uses are cases involving the most wacky religious cults and over-the-top fundamentalist zealots, such as abortion clinic bombers, that comprise a very small minority of American Christians, but Dawkins would have you believe that these people are the majority.      The real situation is almost the opposite: Instead of taking over the government, Christians in the U.S. are facing the possibility of permanent extinction. Republicans continually distance themselves from the so-called Religious Right with every election cycle in an effort to appear more moderate, and Democrats are almost totally secular unless they have to attend Black churches to rally their voters. The courts have consistently shown an anti-Christian bias in the interest of separation of church and state.  White Christians are seen by the secular Left as a powerful voting bloc for Republicans. The Left believes that it was the hated Christian Right that got George Bush elected in both 2000 and 2004, and therefore they must be destroyed. This is why we are seeing more radical atheists on television news and talk shows, and more anti-Christian books like this one by Dawkins.    Dawkins's main purpose as stated in the beginning of the book is to convert anyone with any lingering faith in God to atheism by the time he or she finishes reading it, but I doubt that it will convert anyone. It is too antagonistic and it is an insult to any Christian. The author takes a superior and condescending tone throughout most of the book, implying that because of his superior education and intellect, his faith in Darwin is infinitely more rational than faith in a mythological god. But then he seems to veer off course slightly in the last chapter where he suggests that the Bible should be studied for its historical and literary value along with other great literary works, and that religion might actually serve a useful purpose as a structure for rites of passage such as weddings and funerals. This is a much more sensible approach than trying to conduct a futile and ill-advised crusade to totally wipe out religion.      When men do evil in the name of religion, we need to go after those men, not the religion. Religion is still more a force for good than evil, and it can coexist with natural law. For a sane and logical concept of how contemporary Christianity can mesh with modern science, read \\"Why Christianity Must Change or Die\\" by former Episcopal bishop John Shelby Spong. Even atheist Dawkins might see some benefit in Spong's idea to jettison from religion the obsolete theological dogma and retain only the best parts: love, faith, hope and charity.

B00003CXC7|4.0|This suspense yarn is quieter than many of Hitchcock's efforts, and the New York apartment life it depicts, along with how one recovers from a broken leg, operates a life as a free-lance photographer, and courts a fashion model girlfriend, are all quite changed from 50 years ago. If you must have the same tale updated, try the Christopher Reeve version from about ten years ago...it has charms of its own, but it isn't Hitchcock, and it does lack Jimmy and Grace (who is hot as a pistol despite keeping her clothes on.) In Hitchcock's version, the heroes are at least innocent, if not naive, and the bad guy is a killer, but not a psychopathic mass murderer who kills strangers for no reason. Worth seeing for the stars' performances in roles that give them little to do physically, and much to convey psychologically.

The book, however, seems to be a transcription of the video, rather than a narrative.  And that style is awkward on the page.  I saw a short clip of the dvd and I would recommend watching it over reading it.  I do recommend The Secret, though, because although you may already have an understanding of the fundamental concepts, it's always good to have a reminder.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|PLOT DETAILS FOLLOW<br /><br />Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) is the son of the world's two most famous superheroes, The Commander aka Steve Stronghold (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream aka Josie Stronghold (Kelly Preston). In a world where superheroes are an everyday part of life, their children attend Sky High, a private secondary school built on an anti-gravity platform far above the surface of the Earth, accessible only by a flying school bus piloted/diiven by Kevin Heffernan (THE KING OF QUEENS) and run by Principal Powers (Lynda Carter of WONDER WOMAN).<br /><br />As part of the first day Freshman rituals, the new students are expected to demonstrate their super powers in front of the rest of the class. Graded by Coach Boomer, the retired superhero Sonic Boom, students are either classified as Heroes or Sidekicks; it is the Sidekicks who become the pariahs in the pecking order due to their weak or offbeat, or impractical powers (one boy glows bright yellow, one girl can shapeshift only into a guinea pig, Will's best friend, Layla (Danielle Panabaker) refuses to demonstrate her powers for ethical reasons, and Will shows no sign of super powers at all).<br /><br />Fortunately for Will, the prettiest and most popular girl in school, Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), takes a shine to him. A Technopath, she can build anything out of anything, and helps him in Chemistry Class and with such projects as his ray gun. Will is soon smitten with her. Because of this \\"in\\" with the In Crowd, Will's confidence soars, and he soon begins to develop Super Strength and the ability to fly. Transferred from the  Sidekick classes to the Hero classes, Will starts ignoring his friends, particularly the secretly-in-love-with-him Layla, who is heartbroken.<br /><br />To needle Will, she begins hanging out with Warren Peace, the son of a mixed marriage (Mom's a Superhero, Dad's a Supervillain put in jail by Will's parents); Warren himself is a dour Gothic kid who can shoot fireballs from the palms of his hands.<br /><br />Holy Pep Rally! It soon turns out that Gwen is not quite so nice as she seems. The Prom becomes a revenge fest, in which Will and Warren, backed by the Sidekicks, on one side, and Gwen (aka Major Pain) engage in a titanic battle between Good and Evil. The ending is a foregone conclusion in a movie like this, but let's face it, he couldn't have done it without them.<br /><br />Looking at it coldly, SKY HIGH should have been a bomb, but it isn't, successfully blending the usual acne-angst elements of a Teen Movie (including the obligatory housewrecking party), with one-off Comic Book Characters. The result is light and entertaining, and rarely misses a beat.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is wonderfully goofy as Dad Stronghold, both battling evil and sneaking Will down into the Secret Sanctum for a game of pinball---\\"Don't tell your mother, she's still mad at me for dropping that battleship on her foot\\" kind of dialogue is his stock-in-trade; as Mom, Kelly Preston gets just not enough time in her skintight Jetstream outfit to be truly satisfying on camera in her smallish role; Angarano is just teenage dorky enough as Will, but not so dorky that his transformation is unbelievable; Mary Elizabeth Winstead is just the sweetest thing in a skirt until she isn't anymore.<br /><br />Danielle Pannabaker is the great surprise in SKY HIGH. Alternately shy and retiring, and calm and full of certitude, she imbues Layla with a kind of dignity none of the other characters have. When she finally uses her powers, they are entirely in character for her and yet unusual, a true expression of Female Power at its best.<br /><br />A THREE-AND-A-HALF-STAR effort, SKY HIGH is good family fun fare.lls from the palms of his hands.  <br /> <br />Holy Pep Rally!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|The CDs were in excellant condition and was received as described by the seller.
1582701709|4.0|I love this book and the more I read it the more I love it.  It is must have for someone who needs to learn how to incorporate a positive change in their lives.
0930289234|5.0|I tell people that are interested in it that it is a novel. Period. It took me about 7 hours to read. There are important prose sections between each section. The story line is mostly dark, with heavy psychological overtones. Also, it's more than 20 years old. It completely turned the comic world on its head, but artwork has become a bigger focus and has been refined since this was published (although a lot of the artwork in the novel is great). And, some of the ideas have been copied by others, most notably the idea that superheroes were asked to stop being superheroes was used in The Incredibles (which seems to have taken the complete idea, time period, and everything, verbatim, from this book). Finally, it's a serious novel about angry and confused people trying to figure out why old friends and enemies are dying off around them. It's a mystery, and it was written to completely change the way that stories like this were told.
B000HIVO64|4.0|Bought it for track #2 \\"I think I'm in love\\" but the more and more I listened to it, the more it grew on me.  It's actually quite good.  This is the first Beck CD I've owned, and now it's encouraged me to buy more of his music.
1582701709|5.0|There are four adults in my household, and we each own a copy of THE SECRET.  Granted, the material presented in this little volume is not new.  However, the timing, the presentation, and the collection of authors is.  I am grateful to Rhonda Byrne and the entire group of teachers for giving the world such an inspiring work.  Thank you, Universe.  Your timing rocks!
B000025H0Q|5.0|Thought provoking, reflective lyrics, gorgeous music, what more could anyone ask for? The lounge, jazz sound may not sound like it's conducive to many moods but it is.  I play this when I'm happy, I play this when I'm sad, I play this when I'm frustrated, I play this when I'm tense, I play this when I just... am.  And it perfectly matches all those moods and more.  \\"At The Chime of a City Clock\\" and \\"Hazy Jane 1\\" are my favorites, but the whole record is great.  The sound is so unique, it's easy to forget that this was recorded in 1970, 37 years ago, but only a few songs sound even slightly dated.  <br /> <br />The sadness and tragedy of Nick's life make this even more poignant. I'm just glad the world finally caught on to Nick, and hope there's comfort in him for that even now.  <br /> <br />
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Okay...so this band has got my attention again.  Very interesting piece of work.  I love the fact that they are just letting their chops hanging out loose and free and allowing grooves to gradually unfurl.  Vapor Trails was just waaaayyyy too busy for my tastes.  There was no way to get inside the music.  This album you can let it envelope you.  Their chops are on display in a more subtle fashion, which is fantastic...this is a sign of confidence.  Like they need to prove anything, right?  And the rootsy feel...wow...wouldn't have seen that coming...but hey it works.  Sort of funny how many reviewers are listing their first Rush show or first album, first year they listened as if that is a sign of rank or soemthing  But, hey, whatever to each their own...this album definately gets a thumbs up from this P/G era fan and it will rank high as great all time summertime/road trip with the top down albums.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|This was a great movie which def. did better than Rocky V.  However, for some reason it did not want to play on my computer my Playstation 2 and another DVD player.  I was told on a forum that there was some new protection from Sony and some DVD players didn't want to play it.  But overall this is a great movie and deserves the space on the bookshelf along with the other classics.  If it wasn't for the problem with the DVD playback I would of given the move a Five star.
B0002W4SWC|4.0|Briget Jones Diary is a amusing look at the ins and outs of the dating world for the 30 something generation. A romatic comedy which will having you laughing to the point of tears. Bridget (as brought to life by Renée Zellweger) is a 30 something gal living in London and on the hunt for love, but sometimes willing to settle for sex, and forever psychoanalyzing (and second-guessing) herself we follow her as she tries to figure out what it is she really wants.  <br /> <br />\\"It all began on New Year's Day in my 32nd year of being single,\\" she says sardonically in what is to become the running internal monologue that ties the events in the movie to the entries in her journal.  <br />The story largely concerns Bridget suddenly going from miserably manless (in a hilarious early scene she gets drunk alone at home and sings along to Jamie O'Neal's \\"All By Myself\\") to having two suitors Mark Darcy (Colin Firth)and Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant)-- a situation she simply doesn't know what to do with.  <br /> <br />I find this movie is a must see whenever im having dating issue.  Its almost as if it helps to know that im not the only one who isnt in a perfect relationship package.   <br /> <br />
1582701709|4.0|I was very satisfied with both the prompt delivery and the quality of this product.  It reached me here in Germany in a reasonable amount of time.  I would do business with this vendor again anytime!  Mark E. Grant (author of Blood of Scotland)
B00005JPCF|5.0|This is an outstanding film for all the family.  A lesson in the gifts of the non-conformist and what they have to give to the world.  Delightful!!!
0060594896|5.0|This book has changed my life. Before I began reading it, my life was going nowhere. At 33 I still felt as if I didn't know what I wanted out of life. Canfield has taught me to look inside myself, to find what I want, and to go after it. Frankly, I believe this is the best book I've ever read and from now on I'll carry it everywhere I go, for inspiration, for guidance, and so that I never forget to go after my dreams... to never give up.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The filming of this series is simply stunning throughout the entire 11 part series.  It is like no other footage of nature and the planet earth ever captured before and the 5 years it took to film definately paid off.  Each of the 11 parts ends with a 10 minute section on how they filmed parts of the episode and shows some of the extremes the crew went to to capture this one of a kind footage.  Much of the footage has never been captured before and many of the animals never filmed in such a way previously.  This is more than just a another nature program, much more, it is the best insight I have ever seen or probably ever will see compiled into the life on planet Earth. <br /> <br />The series is not intended to boost the level of knowledge of NASA scientists in earth science or nature matters as the naration is not too deep however, for us regular folks this series should be watched for the revolutionary photography and filming alone which speaks volumes for itself without complex narration.   <br /> <br />This is a set every house should own and every child (and adult) should see at some point.  It illustrates how amazing nature and the earth still are despite the damage and destruction inflicted by humans.  It gives us a visual reasoning as to why we need to protect what we have left. <br /> <br />The DVD set is narrated by David Attenborough rather than Sigourny Weaver who did the version shown on American TV.  I wanted this set because a series of this calibre without the voice of David Attenborough would be unimaginable.  I also read that they had 'dumbed' down the American version on TV and this set with all of the extras such as 3 additional hours of the future of Planet Earth would ensure I didn't miss anything.
B0000028UK|5.0|All I have to say is this: <br /> <br />Just listening to \\"Go,\\" the first track, gets me so pumped to be listening to Pearl Jam. <br /> <br /> <br />You'll be hooked after 1 song, I promise.
B000O178BY|5.0|it is nin and it is a halo. the music sounds like nin but the vocals what is with that. capital G whoa sounds like plucky from tiny tunes.bad but over all  the cd is cool.
1594481717|5.0|This book is an easy, fun, interesting, and inspiring read.  I recommended it to all of my friends.  It is well worth the time.
0553583182|5.0|I'll tell you, this one will really make you think.  It was a good meat and potatoes book.  Gets straight to the point, hits you in the gut and slaps you in the forehead.  After you start to re-program the baggage in your mind you will need to re-read this to work on the next thing.  Then, the next, etc.  Well worth the money.
B000MV9026|5.0|My daughter is three years old and she has watched this movie at least once a day.  Its cute, funny and enjoyable for the whole family to watch.
1581806574|3.0|This is a nice book on the basics of drawing cartoon style dragon characters and other mythic creatures. Basic dragon anatomy, color, facial features, poses, and creative ways to draw them once you master the basics are all covered along with a bit of personification, wit and humor. While it is mostly for young adults, more accomplished artists might also gain some inspiration and ideas or at the least get some laughs from Neondragon's colorful creatures.
2070364232|5.0|I use Le petit Nicolas in my French classes.  The book is divided into short chapters that students enjoy.  The syntax can be challenging, but it also prepares them for more authentic literature in French 4.  I highly recommend this book (and others in the Nicolas collection) to students, teachers, and French-lovers looking for a funny read.
B000N3ST8O|4.0|Pros:   <br />1. Live version of Edge of 17 is the reason to own this CD/DVD.   <br />2. Live version of Rock and Roll is also really good, and will be new to many fans <br /> <br />Cons: <br />1.  No new original songs <br />2.  We've all seen these videos before!  I was majorly disappointed with the videos, and had hoped for some live performances from the Enchanted or TISL tour.  Instead, Stevie included all the ones we can we already see on YouTube or VH-1.  It's nice to hear her talk about them, but some of the videos are more than 20 years old!
1582701709|5.0|Was written in a visual format, pages were \\"old - authentic\\"  It helps that the Teachers are well known authors with credability.  I am always impressed when information like The Secret comes to light with validation from Quantum Physics Doctors.  I could not put the book down when reading it once, now I use it a a reference tool for day to day living.  It has changed my life and has given me the tools to use for happier living.
B000IU3Y3W|5.0|All of the people who have dissed the dvd in this set as not being worth it, don't understand what the intent is. it is not a bonus extra with photos on it. it is a higher resolution music version of the cd. <br />cd's are recorded at 16 bits resolution and at a sampling rate of 44.1khz. the dvd is recorded at 24 bits of resolution and sampling rate of 48 or 96 khz. it does sound better!!!. i understand some people wont care, but for those of us that want the utmost in fidelity will want this version (provided that you have a dvd player instead of a cd player in your \\"music\\" system.) neil has been releasing albums in this form since warner brothers dropped the \\"dvd-audio format\\"(i wont even go into what that is, suffice it to say another specialized audio format) that neil embraced as well
0062502174|5.0|In this consumption-driven, money-mad world, it was refreshing to read a book that pointed up what's really important in this life - and that it may even be possible to have your cake, and eat it, too. Instead of the every man for himself and cheating is OK ethic which rules contemporary thinking, the protagonist lives by the old-fashioned code of truth and honesty. He embarks on a journey which begins as a search for one kind of treasure, and ends in discovery of another kind entirely. I found the book beautifully written and very moving in its message. Highly recommend.
0618154248|5.0|These books were a gift for my 15-month old nephew and he loves them! The entire family knows the books by heart he has us read them so often. And since we're still working on not tearing paper pages out of books, the hard pages make it a lot easier to finish the stories.
0393327655|4.0|I am a huge Sam Harris fan.  I would love for him to write an atheist argument handbook to carry with when you have to run into Christians...However, this book has more anger in it than is needed, and relies on emotion a lot.  That is just what the Josh McDowells are looking for! <br />A bit more of a tempered style and this book would be more effective.
B000NA28IE|5.0|I bought this movie for my son!  He absolutely LOVED It.  I can't give a review for it as a VIEWER, myself, ....but by the response of my son....it must be good!   :)  I will have to watch it soon!.....MAYBE tonight?!?...he is going to work!  ;)
B00005JPGO|5.0|This movie was a action packed thriller.  It never stopped and the end was just NOT what was to be expected.  People will lose out if they do not see this movie.  One of my new favorites!!!
B000A42Y3M|5.0|This is a fantastic  wooden walking toy. The egg rolls as the ant moves on the floor. It is excellent for toddlers and keeps their interest as the egg moves as the child pulls the toy. It's a great classic toy.
B00008973A|5.0|I'm NOT a big fan of musicals. There are only a few of them that I really like, and this is one of them.  The singing is great, the dancing is great, and the acting is even pretty good.  Great music, and a look into the hopeful minds of young Broadway wannabes.  Worth a good look, even if, like me, you don't really love musicals.
B000068TPN|5.0|This portrayal of the Battle of Ia Drang is an excellent study of military leadership, of the impact of the technology of modern warfare, and of the brutality of war.  Hal Moore was one of the US Army's finest commanders and his style of effective military leadership is well-portrayed by Mel Gibson.  The priority that he gave to his men emerges clearly in the story of the battle.  Both the advantages and limitations of airborne assault are depicted as are the horrors of the use of airpower, especially when involving napalm.
0800141660|4.0|If you love period pieces, this one is a good love story. Full of struggles of the heart and humor of the time. A good movie to watch on a rainy day while curled in a warm blanket. Another great Jane Austen classic to watch is Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|very very very good film. watched it three times the day i got it.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I'm 34 and fairly new to Maiden -- they were never my cuppa growing up, though in retrospect, that's mostly because I never gave 'em a chance. Don't know what made me dive in all these years later, but I'm having a blast finally discovering the pleasures of all the \\"classic\\" albums, from the debut on up. I figured the latter stuff wouldn't thrill me as much, but damned if \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" isn't my favorite of the whole lot. Having not grown up with the likes of \\"Powerslave\\" and such, I'm by no means an authority on Maiden's best, but I do know a thing or to about good music (whatever the genre), and this has got to be one of the most powerful -- and smartest -- rock records I've heard in a helluva long time. \\"These Colours Don't Run,\\" \\"The Pilgrim,\\" \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns,\\" \\"The Longest Day\\" ... and good lord, \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" ...  all just incredibly intense and exhilarating music, and frankly, some of the best lyrics I've ever come across on the beaten-to-death subjects of war and religion (with a surprisingly sensitive point-of-view on the latter that really makes me see these guys in a whole new light). I'd recommend this album to other folks who'd never otherwise consider listening to a band like Iron Maiden. All those vintage Maiden albums from the '80s, with the cartoony covers that scared the hell outta me as a kid -- yeah, those are a lot of fun, and I sure wish I'd discovered them sooner than my 30s. But this record, for me, is where the guilty pleasure ends and the awe begins. In a word ... killer.
1582701709|5.0|This book is amazing. <br />Fast reading and interesting. <br />An easy way to change your thinking for positive results.
B000NA28IE|4.0|Great fantasy flick.   Looking foward to the next movie.   Great movie if you like this type of genre.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|It's good to hear these recordings in something superior to the bootlegs.  <br />It is especially interesting to hear tunes that had not been officially released at the time of recording, such as A Man Needs A Maid. <br />The DVD is mostly a waste. It's dark and grainy, and Neil is not too interesting to watch. The clips of him on his ranch have no real context and since the music is played over them you can't hear the dialogue. The frequent images of the reel-to-reel are lame and just point up the fact that the DVD is superfluous. If you haven't already don't pay extra for the DVD.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Fascinating movie.  Not what I expected and have watched it at least 3x now, which I don't normally do.  Wonderful cast (Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti are great).  You'd never guess the ending!  Well worth owning.
B000003CM8|5.0|Despite much great music with a variety of players up to this day, nothing can really top this first Allman Brothers release. The tunes are solid from beginning to end. It's no surprise that most of them have become standards.  <br />It's also no surprise, that at the time of its release, the album was largely ignored. American blues-based rock was still not very popular, and these guys were Southerners to boot. <br /> <br />But other musicians took note; one of them was Eric Clapton. (Give a listen some time to Eric and Duane dueting on Mean Old World.) <br />Anyway, Idlewild South, as a whole was not up to this eponymous debut, and soon Duane would be gone. Eat A Peach was ambitious, but much dominated by Duane's playing on Mountain Jam. Then that wonderful and under-appreciated bassist Berry Oakley would be gone, too. <br /> <br />The ABB would have its ups and downs and be a breeding ground for great musicians and a continuing fount of great music, but nothing has yet topped the tight, focused, writing, playing, and sequencing of this first album. It is a perfect record.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved the movie.  But, then I'm a Trekkie and love sci-fi and watched Firefly when it played as a series on TV.  True to the original concept.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is one of the most moving events ever filmed. The musicians are all icons in their own right and having them on stage to pay tribute to Geroge Harrison will surely bring a tear to your eye. His son being on stage only adds to the emotion. The quality of the sound and the video are near perfect. If you only buy one concert on DVD in your lifetime, this should be it.
B0001I562I|4.0|I recently bought this video to watch with my 5 year old son and he loved it.  I remembered enjoying it when it came out, and my memories did not disappoint me.  The story-line is rather simple, which make it fairly easy for children to follow, but remain interesting enough for adults to enjoy as well.  Like the plot, the graphics and special effects won't bowl you over but are done well enough to tell the story.  A great addition to the colection of young sc-fi lovers.
032147404X|4.0|I liked this even though the style can be a little irritating at times. Good choice of basic topics to get you well on the way to better digital photographs. <br /> <br />Sam
B000LXH0AE|4.0|People who complain about voices in their head used to be locked up or banished.  Now they make great subjects for movies.  This movie is about a methodic and boring man, Harold, who suddenly discovers his life is being narrated to him, as it occurs.  This throws havoc on his well-planned life, and his peers notice it.  Harold seeks help, and gets it from a doctor who actually seems to enjoy his \\"condition\\" and likens it to a fun experiment.  Luckily, Harold discovers who his narrator is, an author with writer's block.  Unluckily, he is doomed to die by the author.  But, she spares him in the end.  During this entire process, Harold also attains a girlfriend, and moves in with his best friend from work.   <br /> <br />The movie is meant as a drama, not really a comedy, but his role in it seems a total spinoff of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show.  Both movies were not meant to be comedies, and were the first major non-comedic outings for a known comedy actor.  The movie flows quite well, and the lack of violence, sex, nudity and language makes it appropriate for adults and children alike.  The ending is somewhat predictable, but nevertheless this is an entertaining movie.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|This overlong and eventually boring film desperately did not deserve the Academy Award for best film - watch INFERNAL AFFAIRS instead and get a bigger impact in 90 minutes than Scorses provides in nearly 3 hours!!!!
1582701709|5.0|Ok. I have a problem with success. Let me give you a rundown:<br /><br />1. Lost wife.<br /><br />2. Lost house.<br /><br />3. Lost job.<br /><br />These things happened for no reason.<br /><br />I could not explain, at all.<br /><br />But now I can:<br /><br />I was having negative thoughts.<br /><br />(Once I thought that my boss was mean for no reason and I didn't show up to work for eight months, then this other time I thought my wife was cheating on me and so... well.)<br /><br />But then I got this book.<br /><br />And now I only have positive thoughts.<br /><br />I can not wait for it to work!
0446605409|5.0|It was difficult to put this book down, suspenseful all the way. Another demille hit.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|This movie is a true classic. And Audrey Hepburn makes it superb. I came to truly adore Moon River and this movie has instantly become one of my favorites. Whenever I have a case of the \\"mean reds\\" watching Breakfast at Tiffany's manages to make the day better. So please watch this movie and I swear, it will change your life.
1599869470|5.0|I'm really enjoying my time with \\"The Master Key System,\\" going through one chapter each week as is recommended.  Its exercises for developing one's abilities with meditation, visualization and focus are really good. I've underlined many passages and enjoy revisiting them. I think this book can be very beneficial and is definitely worth reading.
B000784WMW|5.0|Like most BBC productions of classic novels adaptations, quality is at rendez-vous in this Jane Eyre version. <br />Compared to the VHS the DVD footage is longer by 25%. <br />The casting is remarquable introducing tiny actress Zelah Clarke giving Jane a shy, self-effacing, sensitive and generous touch but never submissive nor resigned in her mind playing opposite tall actor Timothy Dalton giving Rochester an authoritative, imposing and unpleasantly teasing stature but often vulnerable and tormented in his heart. <br />The slow rhythm of action emphasizes the oppressive atmosphere of the situation and lets yourself immersed in what life could be in both wealthy mansions and modest cottages of 19th century Britain northern countryside. <br />This Jane Eyre television drama is the one I like better. <br />
B000BI0WOA|4.0|This anthology from one of the most talented bands I have had the pleasure to listen to is exactly that - a true pleasure.  I am a big fan of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits and his particular take on music is one that touches my soul.  If I want to chill out after a long hard day I take a long dose of this album with my best headphones and my favourite chair and just kick back.  It has to date not let me down once.  Buy it and enjoy.
B0000009SI|5.0|Great album! A must have for Zappa fans. <br />Full versions not available on greatest hits album.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|What can you say about a band that has the courage to play almost exclusively its own music and then make it sound like you have heard it a million times before.  This is one of the true \\"classics\\" of our times and this remastering of the original has produced for the listener an even greater enjoyment and awareness of the sublime musicianship of this band.  If you like Dire Straits and even if you have the original do your self a favour and give this a listen on some decent equipment.  I cannot stop playing it again.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|This album is beautiful. \\"Neon Bible\\" is the antidote to overplayed radio singles and sound-alike bands. The Arcade Fire has delivered a rarity in this era: a full record of intelligent, original music. No bumps about humps, or vain shout-outs to producers, or whiny, navel-gazing fake punk here. If you haven't heard Arcade Fire before, I strongly recommend this album, as well as the band's earlier release, \\"Funeral\\". If you aren't certain whether you would like this, please sample the songs \\"Keep the Car Running\\", \\"Windowstill\\", and \\"Intervention\\" for a good overview of the album as a whole.
B00004Y6NT|3.0|Whilst this is not my favourite album of this classic band it is still better than probably ninety percent of the other albums by other groups on the market in my opinion.  This remastering of the original album has been done with skill and consideration of the feel of this album.  The tracks \\"Lady Writer\\" and \\"Portobello Belle\\" are my favourite tracks on this album. Worth a serious listen.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I love the bonus features... I only wish both parts of the actual film were on the same DVD.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I am an unabashed fan of Mark Knopfler and was looking forward to the release of this album.  Mark has exceeded even his high standards with this album with every track a winner.  If you can listen to this album and not feel better for the experince you should probably book yourself into a funeral home as you are probably dead.  Fantastic.

B00004Y6NX|4.0|This is probably one of the fifty best albums I had heard when it first came out.  This remaster of that album is fantastic.  I have both the original and the remaster and I now only play the remaster.  Highly recommended for Dire Straits fans or anybody else with an ear for good music.

B000002NG7|5.0|mike patton has about 1,3285834753875235 other projects and it's not hard to see why: there is much variation on this cd with the soundscapes, moods.  Fast, slow, punk, seductive, abstract, all of this and more, but the bottom line is that it's all well done. everything with a solid clean follow through and without any hesitation laid on the record like you can sometimes hear in other bands- this is their sound- they're not searching for what they might be or potentially could be, Faith No More is like a triple threat on this record. They do it all and do it all well.. Also check out Loveage. Good stuff.
B00008QSA5|5.0|that came out of nowhere, and with nearly everyone playing it, deservedly became a stone/d classic.  Other than that it was an alleged jam recorded during spare studio time, with as after thought horns dubbed on, then released, it has stood the test of time as one of the best \\"blues\\" recordings of the year 1968.  Put it up there with Blood, Sweat & Tears' \\"Child is Father to Man\\" for that year; few other blues releases for that year, if any, are up there with it. <br />

Babies, that when we learn are sold (farmed) illegally in the underground of 19th Century London; we are left to wonder if Sue really knows the truth of her avowal?

B0007M22TI|5.0|This is the sort of music video you will want to watch again and again. There is so much talent in this video words are not <br />enough to describe it. You must allow your senses to absorb the talent in order to obtain the sheer pleasure that this video contains. Highly recommended.
B000063UR2|3.0|I had never seen any history behind this overly artistic film, but always enjoyed it for what it was. It was nice to get some insight into the original story ideas, and some of the making of the film. The \\"deleted scenes\\" were just that, it didn't help progress the film, in my opinion. <br /> <br />It's just a good fantasy story, with the villian taking the spotlight, though this villian didn't like light at all...
B00062PN6I|4.0|These headphones sound remarkably good for the money. I recently bought a pair of Sennhauser (spelling?) headphones which while rated significantly higher were much more cheaply made, less comfortable and didn't sound nearly as good. I'm not an audiophile but for most purposes, I think you'll be happy with these especially for a pair of headphones under $30.00.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Nice multiple storylines, people you could almost care about (The homeless guy and his dog were the best) but still left the film with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth. Oh well.

B00005YIPM|5.0|There's nothing like a classic album and few would argue with Carole King's \\"Tapestry\\" album.  \\"It's Too Late\\" wasn't the only major hit off this album.  Aretha Franklin had her own hit with King's penned, \\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\\".  James Taylor hit gold with her, \\"You've Got A Friend\\".  \\"Smackwater Jack\\" got a jazz infusion by \\"The Manhattan Transfer\\".  In fact, \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" was covered by:  Cher, The Bee Gees, Dusty Springfield, Dave Mason, The Four Seasons, Laura Branigan, Melanie, Neil Diamond, Linda Ronstadt, Roberta Flack, Joe Walsh and The Shirelles, to name just a few.  Some would argue Carol's version is the definitive, but it's all in the ear.  In SACD format, Carole sings in your living room, just as she still does with ongoing tours.  This album is a must-have.

B00005JPFF|4.0|I have to admit, I went into this one hoping for a great movie, but was expecting to be dissapointed.  I was worried that with all of the characters and plot threads going on that Spidey 3 would just become a convoluted mess and simply eye candy for the action junky.  While it wasn't as well scrpted at #2, Rami did a pretty good job of juggling this menagerie of villains and plots into a cohesive and very enertaining film.  At a hefty 1:36 long, there's still plenty of room for character development in between the many villain fight scenes (probably more so than in the first 2 movies combined, natuarally with 3 villans.)  It sure doesn't feel like everyone was simply going for a paycheck.  Still, Rami did bite off a little more than he could chew in this one, and it shows in places. <br /> <br />I'll try not to spoil anything important (the array of previews have done enough of this already) but here's a brief rundown of all of the plot points that this movie has to work out: <br /> <br />-Peter Parker and his relationship with Mary Jane. <br /> <br />-Mary Jane Becoming jealous of Gwen Stacey's Affection over Peter/Spiderman. <br /> <br />-Harry's/Goblin's vendetta against Peter/Spiderman. <br /> <br />-Emotional moments with Peter talking to his aunt about marriage and the late uncle Ben. <br /> <br />-Spiderman fights Sandman. <br /> <br />-Spiderman deals the black suit. <br /> <br />-Peter battles for the Daily Bugle photographer position with Eddie Brock.... <br /> <br />You get the picture.  There's more plots and subplots in this movie than the first two had combined, and there were more I didn't list for fear of giving the movie away.  In a lot of aspects, Rami and crew deal with these threads pretty well, spinning (no pun intended) them together well enough to be believeable.  In other times, the merging of these threads didn't seem so coherent.  It's kind of like when you're making a mixed CD and you have so many different songs that have to go into it, you kind of have to pick an order for them to be in and hope it sounds good when you play it.  In places it kind of felt like Sandman was in this scene simply becuse we haven't seen him in a while, and 'wow, we kinda forgot about the whole Harry plot thread, let's devote the next twenty or so minutes to that and we'll get back to the rest later.'  Still... considering how much this movie does, you have to give it credit for not being hollow and uninspired like X-Men 3.   <br /> <br />There is one subject that may have forgiven all of that had the movie done better with it... Venom.  Yes, he's in this movie as you've seen from the previews.  In a way, I almost wish that he hadn't been, and if they make another, I sure hope he's in that one.  Venom should be the main show, the big cheese of the Spiderman villains.  Unfortunately, he's introduced lat in the picture and doesn't get a lot of screen time.  It felt like they tried to make him a secondary villain and gave Sandman and Harry front seat... oh well.  At least he was in there.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great movie and I found myself highly entertained.  As far as acting and character development, it succeeds almost as well as the others and it's not at all lacking in some well deserved action.  Go see it and enjoy it thouroughly.  Don't expect it to be better than the 2nd one and you shouldn't be dissapointed.  Here's hoping that there's a 4 (according to IMDB.com there will be) because I can't get enough of wathcing Spider-man fight villains in rediculous situations.  Bravo! <br />

0743270754|5.0|Dr. Goodwin gives us an outstanding book that should be a must read for anyone with aspirations of gaining a leadership role or position.<br /><br />While the focus is on Lincoln's initial three political opponents, Seward, Chase and Bates and their national roles before and after the Chicago Convention of 1860 we are also introduced to the Blair Family, Edwin Stanton, Gideon Wells and a host of other figures in and out of government.  The book gives us a sweeping look at Lincoln as seen through the eyes of many people he was working with on a daily basis.  Some felt they were better than him Seward at the outset or at least were withholding judgement of his capabilities, Bates and at least one never could accept his lesser role in the Lincoln Cabinet, Chase.<br /><br />Of the entire group of Lincoln's rivals I find I have the least empathy with Chase.<br /><br />Granted he did an excellent job as Treasury Secretary but his constant thirst for the presidency to me shows him to be a much smaller person in moral stature than his President.  Granted Lincoln, on moving him to the Supreme Court felt he was putting the best man in place to preserve the gains coming out of the Civil War, I still find I was not impressed with Chase.  Maybe it was his feeling that he should be president as a divine right, I'm not sure.  I just didn't find him a very likable person.<br /><br />Lincoln demonstrated the excellent talent of being able to bide his time and act when conditions were right for action.  He listened to counsel but was his own decision maker.  He gave credit where credit was due such as Seward's request to delay the issuing of the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation until there was a military success to boost it's stature.  Lincoln acknowledged that the linking of the military situation to the proclamation was not something he had considered. The incident made both men seem better leaders.<br /><br />Edwin Stanton met Lincoln, briefly, in Ohio when Lincoln was working on a case that had originally be slated to be heard in Illinois and a local lawyer was deemed useful.  The case was moved to Ohio and although Lincoln was no longer required, the team lead by Stanton \\"forgot\\" to tell him.  When the trail date came due Lincoln traveled to Cincinnati and met his co-counsels who promptly dismissed him and ignored him.  Lincoln vowed never to go to Cincinnati again.  Fortunately he was able to rise above this slight and when he needed a new Secretary of War, he was able to choose Stanton as the best man for the job.  Lincoln may have not forgotten slights he received along the way but he was able to rise above them for the greater good of the nation.<br /><br />Lincoln is agurably or greatest president and Dr. Goodwin's ten year effort has produced a book that is unique from most others about Lincoln.  She gives us a much more personal look at the man and the men and women around him.  She gives us a much more personal contact with these people.  We learn of Mary Lincoln's unannounced and unpublicized visits to wounded soldiers in Washington area hospitals.  We learn of Edwin Stanton's feelings as he listened to the sounds of wounded soldiers being brought into Washington from battles in the local areas.<br /><br />Dr. Goodwin has given us a history of people in a time of great crises and makes everyone, good, bad or indifferent, involved in this time, important, as did her subject, Lincoln.  Again a good leadership trait.<br /><br />As a leadership guide this is an excellent work and as a reading of history it is outstanding!<br /><br />I bought this book originally in paperback and over a long cold winter in norhtern Japan, I devoured the book.  The pages are a bit dog eared and ketchup and mustard stained from my habit of reading while eating.  I recently bought a hard back copy of the book at a book signing by Dr. Goodwin which will be my \\"good\\" copy.  The paperback will continue to be my everyday reading copy.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone as an essential work in the on-going study of Lincoln.y. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to everyone as an essential work in the on-going study of Lincoln.

0312330537|5.0|there are some books that you just can't put down, Shantaram was one of those, I was drawn to read it in the first place because it was based on truth and I prefer truth to fiction by and large so to get truth dressed up as novel was superb.  The characters leap large and alive from the pages, you yearn to see what they look like, if they match your imagined portrait.  this book is a ripping good yarn and inspirational in it's way - and opens one's mind to another part of the world - having finished it I determined to go to visit India!  Anyway, I've bought two copies to pass around friends (to make them read it) - loved it and thoroughly recommend it.

1563898586|5.0|Though seemingly more shallow than his other classics, Moore's \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" has unique strengths not to be missed. In center stage is the eloquent finesse with which Alan Moore pedals his wares. Each word carefully chosen and arranged so as to HYPNOTIZE the reader into a trance of intrigue and excitement. In this most exotic revision of 19th century literature we see Hero/Adventure comics in their historical setting, and a start to bridging the gap between ancient mythology and the caped crusaders.  <br />This reinvention of classic Adventure helps remind us that though the stories of the genre have been explored through out time, it is the pictures that are of our era. And for that Kevin O'Neil gives us a world of scribbles and wonder perfectly suited to their story and time. <br />Whether your a desperate addict of comic book literature or a curious enthusiast, \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" will bring out the adolescent in you and leave you with a grin. To believe someone would pedal their own wares for over sixty pages without once blushing or breaking a sweat is beyond comprehension! Alan Moore, we pay tribute. This is amazement you cannot afford to miss!
0156030306|5.0|I was so surprised by this book. Flowers For Algernon was one of the best books I've read this year and I really wasn't expecting it. <br /> <br />It is the story of Charlie Gordon, a man in his thirties with mental retardation. Charlie is the subject of a psychological research project at a university that is examining the effects of a new surgical procedure on mental retardation. Charlie's estranged sister gives the university permission to perform the procedure on Charlie. The procedure proves to be at least a temporary success and Charlie goes from having mental retardation to having an IQ of 185 in a manner of weeks. <br /> <br />The experiment is initially tried on a white mouse named Algernon. Algernon is tested through a complex maze where he is rewarded by food after reaching the end. Charlie races Algernon with a maze of his own and receives a shock if he goes the wrong way. At the beginning of the book, Algernon beats Charlie to the finish line every time. But Charlie soon soars past Algernon and through the process grows close to the mouse. <br /> <br />The book is written in the form of journal entries kept by Charlie for the experiment. At the beginning of the book, words are misspelled, ideas are vague, and relationships are simple. As the book progresses, so does Charlie's thought process and so do his relationships. Charlie learns what true love is as he falls in love with his teacher, Alice. He learns what physical love is as he comes into contact with his artistic and eccentric neighbor, Fay. And he learns the pains of relational love as he relives memories of his family and friends. <br /> <br />What was most touching to me about this book were these flashbacks and moments of recognition. When Charlie was still mentally retarded, he didn't realize when people were laughing at him or making fun of him. He didn't realize that when his mother was crying it was because she was ashamed to have him as a son. But now that he has had this operation he isable to look back on these situations and realize what was going on. You can imagine the pain of this. <br /> <br />Charlie is initially excited about \\"becoming smart\\". He's been teased throughout his life for \\"being a moron\\" and has been the subject of people's amusement. What Charlie soon finds is that acceptance is a hard thing to come by. Charlie goes straight from mentally retarded to genius. As a genius, he is seen as arrogant and absurd and is once again estranged by his peers.

0380725398|5.0|I read this book because someone told me at one of my book signings that Jamaica Inn was the most frightening book she ever read. After reading for several hours right before bed, I awakened terrified, in a cold sweat. Since then, I have studied Du Maurier's style and it is masterful. She has the ability to make the main character feel so real, you imagine you are walking in her shoes. Long after putting the book down, the characters remain with you, as does Jamaica Inn itself and the surrounding countryside. Her books have influenced my own writing. It is a shame that during her lifetime, her books were seen as romance, the pinings of a woman... This is suspense at its very best.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|It was interesting to taste the sound of Arcade Fire. <br />There are a few sinphonic elements mixed in the new generation rock of the group. <br />The rythm is OK and the ideas stimulating like the title of the album. <br />Can we consider this music a starting point for a future project of rock innovation?
B00005JPCF|3.0|\\"Happy Feet\\" is an amiable little movie, a slight good-natured bit of animation.  And the animation is spectacular, as review after review has attested.  The technical achievements of \\"Happy Feet\\" are noteworthy, including the sound.  If you have a subwoofer, it will get a workout during some scenes.<br /><br />But as review after review has also attested, there is no story here.  If you like plot, you will be sadly disappointed.  I turned to my wife at the 30 minute mark into the movie and said that I still didn't know what the story was, and she didn't either.  This movie may be good for very little kids, who will enjoy the animation and singing and dancing and don't have any demands or expectations about plot.  But, older children and adults are likely to be looking at their watches well before the ending wondering when this overly-long film will end.<br /><br />This is at least worth a rent for families with young children.

0452286751|5.0|This is a book that every person should read... especially when one is encountering that \\"search for meaning\\" phase or phases in their life.  It is a story about why one should never compromise values.  This book, although a thought provoking fictional adventure,  will tap into all that you've experienced so far in life and will help explain the things you felt that were significant to you in one way or another, but could not identify... The Fountainhead, in the very least, inspired me to get my engineering degree.  The story and the surrounding philosophy continues to have an impact on me regarding my career, my relationships, my family, my life...

B00005JPFH|4.0|I like the action sequences on this one and I think the acting is at the same level as the other 2, but one of the reasons the scenes does not work (action/romance secuences) is because there is no music that reflects the emotions of the actors, (like in spiderman 1 & 2),for moments I feel like I was watching Archive footage and not a finished film. <br /> Bring back Danny Elfman!  I think the music score was mediocre on spiderman 3 , Think about this the next time you see this movie and you will agree with me. <br />Thanks for reading...

I had pretty much adopted the attitude that I received the hand that I was dealt in life.

The good news is I feel empowered to break the cycle and provide loving feedback for my children at all times.

There are demons and angels, but if you don't like sarcasm you won't like this.    Personally, I love sarcasm.  It is what I live for, but this just didn't do it for me.  I would steer you toward something like Janet Evanovich (Humorous Chick Lit) or my fave Chuck Paluniak.    Anyhow good luck hunting but skip this one.

B00003CXAY|4.0|The theme suggested by Koyaanisqatsi is remarkably visible in the stream of imagery, making the documentary commenatary very informative and suggestive. Koyaanisqatsi held my attention, and presented itself not only as a work of art, but also as an informing work of art. Powaqqatsi did not appear so readily accessible in a thematic way. I found the imagery, though provoking and immediate, to be an unfocused narrative. What is the message? The title suggests a theme, but the train of images fails to synthesize a statement initiated in the title. Of course life is in transition. How does that interest me? As a single viewer, I wasn't as interested in the Powaqqatsi video as I was in the Koyaanisqatsi imagery. Creatures of the world, including humans, are parasitic? Perhaps the videographers should have included some vegetarian \\"fare\\" (offering a solution to our animal natures). Finally, Phillip Glass's stimulating soundscapes, poignant and haunting, make both documentaries worth the bother.
B000002UB3|5.0|I bought this as a 331/3 LP when it first came out.  I have loved it ever since and I am thrilled it is out on CD.
0312330537|5.0|When I stumbled across an article recently that a movie based on the novel `Shantaram' was in the works starring Bollywood/Hollywood superstars Amitabh Bachchan and Johnny Depp I was intrigued to say the least and bought the novel.    For the next few weeks I was simply captivated by the amazing story that unfolded on the pages before me. Adventure, humour, love, betrayal, brutality, tenderness, sorrow, elation; the author has an incredible gift for telling stories and leads the reader through a fascinating tale with many highs and lows, twists and turns, from the depths of despair to the heights of euphoria. My only complaint is that it ended; and I now find myself in a lurch, searching for something else to read that can even come close to comparing to this. I recently learned Gregory David Roberts is working on a few sequels as well as a prequel to this masterpiece; needless to say I can hardly wait to get my hands on them!    I can't recommend this novel highly enough!
6304696566|5.0|This might be the best film John Wayne ever took part in...<br /><br />The Duke doesn't play every1s hero as he does in most of his other roles... this might be the quintessential western... the scene layout and establishing shots of John Ford... revolutionized filmmaking across the world... many \\"awarded\\" great filmmakers have pointed this film out as one of the textbooks for their success... the basic blueprint for modern filmmaking...<br /><br />One you can't miss... if you haven't seen this... you don't where your favorite filmmaker came from...
B00026L7O0|5.0|Excellent movie especially in full screen edition and recommend it to all that enjoy psychological thrillers and why they do not adapt all of the movies in the 1:33:1 format as an alternative purchase from widescreen format for those consumers who prefer it I will never know
B000NNXEH0|4.0|I will only review this particular DVD because this film is one of those classics that was so instrumental in filmmaking that it has become so much more than a \\"movie.\\"  Beyond the masterfully written screenplay & past the deft performances of the ensemble, this film is watched over and over by the megalopolis that is the cluster of great filmmakers of the 70s, 80s, 90s and today to keeps Kurosawa's vision fresh in their own heads.<br /><br />This DVD has no special features.  It is simply the theatrical version... obviously... if u can afford the criterion collection... that's the way to go... but... if ur an aspiring/struggling filmmaker... & u can do what the greats do... which is... the week before you start shooting... you watch The Cinematic Formula (The Searchers + It's A Wonderful Life + Lawrence of Arabia + Seven Samurai).<br /><br />Good luck... see you on the festival circuit!
B000NA28HU|5.0|well done, the stars did excellent true to life portrayals of there roles. some portions could use more transition. i hope they make a second movie using the second book.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I've always been a fan of the Bond movies, but the latest ones have been overly cheesy. This Bond movie is much more serious and much more realistic with some of the best action scenes I've seen in a while. Craig doesn't look like your stereotypical Bond, but he plays the role well.<br /><br />The movie looks great on Bluray. If you are looking for a good HD movie, I'd recommend this one.
B000NA28HU|4.0|This is a good movie for adults and kids alike, that is kids of a certain<br /><br />age.
0446614459|5.0|I had read this book a couple of years ago and liked it then and recently read it again.  It seems like it was better the second time around.  Could not put it down. <br /> <br />I love how the whole story just seemed to tie in to the conclusion. <br /> <br />You will enjoy it.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|This movie was entertaining, but too slow in to many places.  The Bond  <br />character was not the James Bond.
1592402038|5.0|I thought I was the only one who routinely called companies when their outdoor signs used the wrong punctuation, or were misspelled, or, the horror, used an apostrophe to denote posession, when they really only needed a word pluralized. Lynne's book is fantastic and a great read for those who are usually pretty good with grammar, but sometimes need a refresher. It's also fantastic for those of us who need an ego check that we're on the right path for proper grammar skills.  <br />Her follow-on, \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves: Why, Commas Really DO Make a Difference\\" for kids is a great primer for school-age kids with great illustrations. I highly recommend both books.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I wil not repeat what everybody else said on here about how beautiful it is and the cinematography being top notch.  NO DOUBT about that.  It was simply awesome.  The one drawback?  I wish they DID replace David Attenborough's voice with Sigourney Weaver's voice.I heard Sigourney Weaver's version on cable and then heard the Attenborough version and her voice is just so much more pleasant and crisp to hear and understand. I know many people love David's voice...but quite honestly...he really sounds like he is spitting all over the microphone and it's quite distracting to me (if not disgusting) when I hear his gurgling and sputtering.  Sorry...but that ruined it for me.  But anyways...I just ignored it and tried to love the great scenes!

B000C3H4L8|1.0|But five stars for the album and the noticeably better sound.  I had a very difficult time playing this album, much less converting it to mp3 files.  Out of three computer cd players, the disc only played in one, a Toshiba that came with my office Dell.  It didn't work on my Plextor or Sony players at home.  Of three stereo cd players, it only played on one.  When I was able to use the cd burner, I burned a new disc, which played just fine in all players.  I don't know if this is because the disc is Dual Disc or what.<br /><br />My point is that if you have problems, keep on trying.  It is worth it for these remastered Talking Heads discs.
B000MXPE74|5.0|This is my surprise love of the year so far. I'd heard great things about it, and of course heard the iPod ad song, but still resisted (\\"Flathead\\" might be my least favorite on the album). I finally decided to see what all the hype was about and I have to say, I'm NOT disappointed. This whole CD rocks!

1582701709|2.0|Did you all ever see Donnie Darko? Well, in the movie they made reference to a fictional \\"self help\\" video made by a guy who was a sicko any ways, and the video (as Donnie proved) was EVIL.   <br />  I am not calling the author a sicko, but the concept of this is that the universe revolves around you.  What you think sends out a frequency to the world and that changes things.  You think positivly and your mean co-workers vanish, or you think negativly and Bozo the clown kidnaps your mother?   <br />  I definetly agree with the thought that our thoughts can un-lock some great power, but I do not think that power alters the course of the universe, I think that It taps into our own unknown hidden abilities and allows us to function at a higher level of conciousness, which in turn can produce numerous positive results and \\"fun happy\\" feelings.  <br />  I love new thought and philosophies, but I sincerly think this book is sincerly flawed.   People grasp onto anything, espicially something so \\"easy\\" that will make them less miserable. So aside from the frequency deal, the positive thinking part is great, the rest is a crock......If u ask me, which you did...,,, right??? <br />

B000AM6OQ2|4.0|This is a very good ghost story from the the man who gave us \\"Halloween\\" and \\"The Thing\\" remake. It's amazing how effective some green lights and a fog machine can generate more chills than the over blown and boring remake which cost 100 times the money to make. This is a good movie to watch on Halloween or any late night with the lights turned off! I own the original release with the green cover and it is the one you want to buy if you can find it. The later one with the blue cover is the same with some added lame trailers for the remake.

I hated to stop when I reached my destination. (I was listening while I was driving.) You want to continue until you are done with all of them.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants to change their life.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I've had a pair of 240's for the last 8 years. About 2 years ago, I ran over the cable with my office chair, and basically ruined the headphones. I mended the cable, but they never really sounded right again.<br /><br />So, I got a pair of Shure E40's, and they've been quite good. Yesterday, I finally realized that the jack on the AKG's was broken, not the wire. So, I replaced the jack, and for the first time in about two years, am using the headphones again.<br /><br />The sound quality is leagues better than anything else I've used in the last two years. Better than the Shures, better than the Sennheisers I got through work. There's a huge amount of detail that I'd been missing with the other headphones. I'm not an audio professional, or even a hardcore audiophile, but I've been a musician since I was young, and have a good ear.<br /><br />For the price, I haven't heard anything that even comes close to these headphones. Just watch the cord.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|Snakes and Arrows will not disappoint those of us who are Rush fans.  It boasts the usual high production values, nice LOUD mixes, irregular meter, and finely crafted instrumental execution that has made most of us fans in the first place.  For the record, despite my recommendations, I'm a loyal fan and going to see them on tour, of course.  As instrumentalists, Lee, Lifeson, and Peart have gained enviable reputations in their respective niche(s).  The edginess of the earlier, more youthful efforts has been transmuted somewhat by slick production, and mostly predictable lyric territory by Peart since the late 80s..  This is my only wish for the band- that someone else might try their hand at lyrics.  I'm finding that existential poetry doesn't have the shelf-life that it should.  How about some real songs about passion, love, and tragedy?  We know that these have been experienced.  I'm getting the feeling that deeper feelings are being channeled a little formulaicly, and hiding behind fine instrumentals and production.  For instance, we know that U2s Joshua Tree can't hold a candle, in the \\"craft\\" department, to most of Rush's output.  But the Irish offering in point has a much more direct and passionate appeal on the lyric level.  This, I find, is missing in much of Peart's lyricism, which, excellent as it is at times, resembles prose more than poetry.  All this is just personal taste, and I expect it will engender healthy discussion.  Favorite songs for me on Snakes and Arrows are \\"Far Cry\\"  \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" (Outstanding rocking by the boys here), Lifeson's solo 12 string number \\"Hope\\" and just generally, for strength of writing, \\"Faithless\\" and \\"Spindrift\\".  One more (possibly sacreligious) suggestion is that it might be time to find an extra keyboardist/vocalist to round out the mix and infuse new color and tension into the songwriting.  How about me, guys?  See you on tour.

0151013047|5.0|A doomed love affair among characters easily seen as icons makes this a stellar piece of political commentary.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I loved this movie.  It is a heartwarming story of 2 women and the men that enter their lives, unexpectantly.  The women have similar problems with the loves in their lives and traveling to a new place brings new possibilities.  Jude Law plays the emotionally available man - a nice twist to the usual story; and Cameron Diaz plays the women whose heart is closed and can't commit to a relationship.  This movie brings the story of hope and that each day is a new beginning.  It shows us that we need to let go of our emotional baggage and be present to what is in front of our face.
1400063515|5.0|If you loved Fooled By Randomness, then you'll love this sequel to that story even more.  This book is the exception to the general rule about sequels.

0385333846|5.0|This classic anti-war novel will open your eyes to the horrors of warfare and how seemingly unnecessary it is.
0061142026|5.0|This isn't an original concept. Typical fairy-tale, following archetypal models. However, this IS Neil Gaiman we're talking about, so the story telling is so powerful that you get completely taken in. The writing is excellent, the plot is strong and the characters are well-thought-out. Gaiman takes us on a classic journey through a fantastic land peopled with brilliant, quirky characters. The story can be brutally real at times, while still maintaining the mystique of mythology and folk tale (something Gaiman does particularly well). A must read for fairy tale enthusiasts and fans of Gaiman alike.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I can only pray that are children will forgive us if we don't do something soon. These rich oil people need to step off there wagon and make way for cleaner energy.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|Was lucky enough to catch this in a tiny screening the week it opened and instantly knew I had to own this film as soon as it was available.  There has never been an opening sequence shot with such frankness in main-stream film.  Once you adjust to the explicit nature of this movie and realize that the film's unapologetic presentation of real people having real sex is actually a wonderful vehicle to instantly, intimately connect with these characters on all levels that are open and human, you start to settle into a beautiful movie about people just trying to integrate - to connect with something outside of their self, their work, their ideas - to find that elusive moment of equanimity.  The ride has great ups and downs - plenty of moments for laughs, tears and titillation.  The end of the film is also shot in incredibly beautiful simplicity (this scene thematically reminded me of the end of Hedwig - James Cameron Mitchell is so good at taking the viewer right to the precipice of change/acceptance along side the main character - impossible to see his films without taking away some personal insight).  This movie reminds us all that it takes darkness to see stars and silence to hear music.   <br /> <br />The bonus materials on the DVD are great too - the \\"making of scenes\\" are a must view. I just wish they had included a segment on the animation in the film like they did on the Hedwig DVD.
B000002TWN|5.0|D'angelo is another great singer who is in a class by himself. Its kind of hard to ignore the jazz and hip hop influences throughout this album. D'Angelo breathes life into every song and makes it hard for you to dislike it. The brother has talent. For starters anybody who didnt know that Brown Sugar was about weed is kind of slow. Brown Sugar, Chocolate Thai are old nicknames for mary jane but the song is still funky(I cant believe I said the word funky). Other excellent recordings are ALRIGHT, JONZ IN MY BONZ, ME AND THOSE DREAMIN EYES OF MINE, SMOOTH, WHEN WE GET BY, LADY etc. Bottom Line: D'Angelo's Brown Sugar is an album you can listen straight through without skipping a track. D'Angelo holds it down with the smooth vocals over beautiful production just a classic album period. Even though I liked his second album Voodoo, it cant compare with Brown Sugar.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Tremors series, and I had all the movies on VHS (well, except for #4).  The VHS tapes are getting old, so I thought I would upgrade to DVD.  This \\"Attack Pack\\" was a great value, and I recommend it to any Tremors fans.
0307276902|5.0|I don't care what any body says, whether fact or fiction James Frey wrote a powerful gut wrenching book. It grabbed me from the first page and kept me on edge until the end. Read his second book, \\"My Friend Leonard\\", you'll be weeping and cheering at the end!
0743454537|4.0|A sensitive and thoughtful review of several complex issues, i.e. the human rights of the child versus the authority of the parent, quality of life vs the sanctity of life, the right to choose one's own destiny. The book was elegantly written and lovely to read. The ending was a bit of a disappointment in that it was a little to pat. A very good choice for a book club discussion.
B000002G87|5.0|Duane Allman was the fuel that powered these sessions and the slide playing on this session is as powerful now as when it was recorded. A fantastic collection played with the raw fire that ignited when Clapton and Allman tore into these songs. You can see Eric Clapton playing a number of these songs in 2007 with Derrick Trucks playing the slide parts which is excellent, but Duane had a soulfulness in his playing here that is timeless. A great CD.
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert helps us all to enjoy her travels and share in her marvelous insights regarding life, love, and the spirit.  I laughed and also had times when I just sat back and savored her discoveries which she is able to articulate in such profoundly simple ways.  This book was a joy to read.  I hated to see it end.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|All fans of 'The Downward Spiral' must hear this in 5.1 DVD-Audio.  Some of the songs are concentrated across the front three channels with the rears serving as ambients.  Other songs explode from all five speakers and swirl around the room like whirling dervishes.  The clarity and detail is astonishing.  I've compared this to a friend's SACD version and there is no contest.  The DVD-A wins on all fronts: frequency range, bass response, and seperation.  There is a general feel of space and depth on the DVD-A that is truly remarkable. <br /> <br />I was lucky enough to catch NIN on their 'Spiral' tour, and this High-Resolution version of the album is the closest I've heard to Reznor's enveloping concert experience, yet with the care and precision of an expertly crafted studio album.   <br /> <br />If you don't have a DVD-Audio set-up, here is the perfect excuse to take the plunge.  Don't delay, get it today.
B000MV9026|3.0|I was expecting a more kid friendly movie and was somewhat disappointed.  Most of the dialogue was over their heads and they eventually wandered off without watching the movie.  I do not recommed this movie for young kids.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|I would give the movie itself five stars, but the DVD and Blu-Ray presentation are not as strong. The 1980 Flash Gordon movie is one of the funnest romps in the space opera I have ever experienced. Much more true to the Saturday morning serial kind of sci-fi that Star Wars was paying homage to. There is an inherent camp value that this movie never forgets and it just makes the film a joy to watch. Plus the soundtrack from Queen just ups the fun factor even more. You would think this combination of music and content would make for a very campy film, but not necessarily. While the movie definitely knows it's roots and is having fun with that you really can't call Flash Gordon a cheesy B-movie.     The Savior of the Universe (SotU) Edition DVD lacks the very energetic commentary by Brian Blessed (plus production stills and other static extras) that the European Silver Anniversary Edition DVD and even lacks the commentary by Same Jones and Melody Anderson made for an International Edition (that of course we never saw in the U.S). In spite of that you do get a remastered film with 2.35:1 anomorphic widescreen, 5.1 Dolby Surround and the movie trailer (none of the European releases had that). While the SotU edition was remastered and looked a ton better than the previous releases it wasn't perfect. While background matte effects are noticeable they are easily forgiven considering the sharper picture, but there were certain matted special effects blocks used on the spacecraft that were painfully obvious in the remaster. Either they didn't bother to digitally clean them up or it wasn't technically possible. Audio also sounded rather thin considering this was supposed to be digitally remastered.     Another thing that bugs me is SatU DVD is set in an impressive and slightly oversized case, but when you open it up all you get is the DVD and the pencil art insert from Alex Ross. No booklet detailing any info on the movie... not even a single page chapter list. Yeah, Yeah... most of you would say \\"but the remastered movie is what's important\\" but considering the sendup (and packaging) I would expect at least something more than just a disk and a sketch. I have seen movies with far less noteriety get more in their packaging than this.    Where the Savior of the Universe Edition improves upon the previous U.S. release significantly the Blu-Ray edition really stands out heads and tails above the rest. The visual difference is breathtaking. Details and textures come out that I have never seen before (and I was one of those kids who played the VHS of this film to death). Some scenes show so much clarity you would be hard pressed to think they were done recently. I think the sets that were done to be interiors stand out more for some reason so it's not really inconsistent mastering. The special effects problems that were very obvious in the SotU Edition are still there, but the matte blocks are far less noticeable with some cleaned up entirely. Audio is stand out amazing. Don't bother looking for any noticeable surround, but then again this movie was done in stereo. Now it's in crystal clear, deep and full stereo. No more 'thin' soundtrack.     The packaging for the Flash Gordon Blu-Ray is identical to any other single disk Blu-Ray you may find. That makes it a lot easier to fit in with the rest of your collection unlike the SatU Edition's oversized box. You still get nothing special as far as any booklets or liner notes. Also you no longer get the art insert from the previous release. So still nothing really special on that front.     Both the SotU Edition and the Blu-Ray release have identical features with just a little irrelevant extras added to the Blu-Ray What you get on both is two featurettes. One is from Alex Ross (the guy who painted the DVD cover) on how much he loves the movie. He actually does a really good job of making his featurette much like an analysis of the movie and would have worked great as narration for a documentary. Instead you just get Alex in a chair with a few movie clips thrown in here and there. The other featurette is called Writing a Classic by screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr.     The Blu-Ray exclusives are just BDLive and some annoying streaming ticker that will give you \\"news\\" from Universal Pictures. If your Blu-Ray player isn't connected online you may be able to spare yourself the latest in invasive advertising. The movie case promises exclusive content from the BDLive features, but none of it is related to Flash Gordon. Currently all you get are more promotional tidbits for other movies. You know what guys? This would be a great place to add those freakin' commentaries you keep leaving out.     I can't for the life of me figure out why they didn't just add the European edition commentaries to the Blu-Ray release and maybe add the new things to sweeten the pot. But to have a Blu-Ray missing some cool bonus material that's already out there? Not the smartest move in my book.     So which edition should you get? If you have a Blu-Ray player definitely the Blu-Ray edition. It is the best remaster visually and sonically by far of any edition, European or otherwise. If you REALLY want that Alex Ross pencil insert exclusive to the SotU Edition then you may have to make a choice or double dip. Unfortunately there is no definitive edition for Flash Gordon, but the current winner in at least presentation of the film is Blu-Ray.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|I love this DVD, I think the women are all fantastic.  My husband and I are going to see them in person at the William Saroyan Theater in Fresno, CA on May 20, 2007. My husband's ancestors are from Wales and he is so looking forward to seeing them in person.
B000GYHVFC|5.0|The HD DVD version of this film (the only version I've seen) is easy to look at - the film is very well done by all parties involved.<br /><br />The story is definitely worthy of the big screen. The 5.1 audio tracks are very clean and captivating. The great HD picture comes through crisp and bright, clean and awesome.<br /><br />I have never seen the animated series so I have no comments about its similarities, but I consider this film a keeper for the collection that I can watch again in the future and still enjoy it.<br /><br />\\"Aeon Flux\\" offers a nice variety of well executed, pulse quickening action sequences, coupled with brilliant performances by a great cast. What you end up with is an hour and thirty-two minutes of excellent action-packed film!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought it.<br /><br />If you enjoy TV's \\"Alias\\" (please no comparison follow-ups, I'm not comparing) you may likely enjoy \\"Aeon Flux\\" - not that they're the same thing, but there is this mission...with a captivating female lead...this one's a bit more on the sci-fi side, though...I don't want to blow it for anyone, just go out and get it if that kind of premise piques your interest in any way. If you're curious so far, you can pretty much count on enjoying the movie.
0743496728|5.0|After reading Jodi Picoult's \\"Perfect Match\\", I was disappointed with the ending; however, the same cannot be said for \\"Nineteen Minutes!\\" From the very first page, you will be hooked until the surprising ending! Ms. Picoult has dealt with the subject of teenage alienation and how it  affects more than just the \\"dweebs\\" or the \\"cool\\" kids. The book was well-written and I found it difficult to put down. <br /> <br />If you want to great summer read, definitely take a look at \\"Nineteen Minutes.\\"

074356619X|5.0|Very clear, simplistic, understandable and therefore so easy to apply.  It has shown us how to achieve vibrational harmony with our desires which has allowed us to attract everything we want - and each day we are amazed with what we get!  If you want to attract what you want then the Secret can definitely show you how.  Highly recommended.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|I love the movie, its great. Bobby did a great work as a director. The story it's great, and the performances are very good. Angelina's performance it's almost a cameo, so I dont understand why it's her picture on the poster of the movie, it's like Julia on Oceans Eleven. <br />Matt did a good work, and like always Bobby bright on his character. At some points it is a little bit slow, but not that much. I highly recomended.
1401907717|5.0|Ever since I purchased \\"Daily Guidance From Your Angels\\" I have used it with clients, students, friends and myself.  When I give a client a private Reading, before we conclude I ask The Angelic Realm what final message does the client need and then open the book.  The Angelic Message is ALWAYS appropriate and timely.  Of course, I also use the book, especially before I begin my day.  I ask \\"What do I need to know right now?\\" Then, I open the book.  It never fails; the message is exactly what I need. <br /> <br />I think there is also a softcover version of the book, but I find the hardcover edition more elegant and beautiful.  In addition, the beautiful royal purple ribbon marker is excellent for keeping one's place. <br /> <br />I have purchased several of Dr. Doreen Virtue's books, but this one is definitely one of my favorites.  I cannot over recommend it.
B00004ZD69|3.0|(please ignore number rating, I don't generally find them meaningful) <br /> <br />\\"Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven\\" by Godspeed You Black Emperor is a long sequence of shifting soundscapes, mainly instrumental, but with some recorded speech and other effects.  Rather like walking along a beach where the buildings and so forth on the shoreline change every few miles, (I mean it's structured that way, not that it has any seashore sounds).  Its the sort of thing I might have playing in the background that requires little concentration.  I didn't find it rythmically, melodically or harmonically interesting ... but I guess the point is the whole sonic sequence, which you might like.
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|Not the absolute best hd-dvd I've ever seen, but very sharp nonetheless.  This is definitely the best medium on which to watch this movie, I've compared to the blu-ray version on the same television and the HD-DVD version wins slightly in video as well as audio.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|This album is really good. it really is her \\"best damn thing\\". i love the song \\"girlfriend\\". it is fun to sing and listen to. the cuss words keep the song from being immature. the \\"F\\" word is in it, but it is blocked out, or at least it is on my copy of the cd.  <br /> <br />The other songs are pretty good, too. you should give this album a chance.

B000GFLE86|4.0|I got hooked on Madeline Peyroux after coming across a description in someone's Amazon list of jazz vocalists.  Her first two albums are lovely, but perhaps suffer a bit from sounding at times like Billie Holiday imitations (not that that's a bad thing).  This album has the most individual character: you get more of a sense of Peyroux as an artist in her own right rather than a remarkable voice in search of the right material.  It seems everyone is covering Joni Mitchell's lovely \\"River\\" these days (see Diana Krall and, before her, Diane Reeves), but Peyrouyx does a nice turn in a duet with k.d. lang.
6305696071|5.0|[[ASIN:6305696071 Pretty Woman (10th Anniversary Edition)]] A great modern adaption of the age old classic love story.

B000BJS4SU|4.0|For those of you who, like me, first heard John Mayer as another nasally, self-indulgent pop singer, this album is a revelation: excellent blues-rock guitar throughout and passionate renditions of Mayer songs.  There's a delightful cover of Hendrix's \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" and an equally refreshing cover of a Ray Charles song.  This album made me a believer in Mayer, even though I'm a long way from his generation.
B000JLTRJ0|5.0|[[ASIN:B000JLTRKE World Trade Center (Widescreen Edition)]] An Excellent job of showing the human angle and suffering which occured on 9/11/01.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|I was a bit uncertain at first when I started to watch this movie but as the story unfolds it all comes together and makes for a great movie. This is definitely the movie to bring closure to the Rocky Saga. Just a great movie all the way round!!
B000035P5E|5.0|One of the best WWII Spy novels, made into a great with outstanding performances by Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan. Worth the price of purchasing, especially if you like this type of movie. Donald Sutherland does an excellent job of portraying a German Agent living in England during World war II, although his nemsis, a former student turned soldier does a rather poor imitation of a self righteous person bent on identifying his former teacher for Scotland Yard. It is predictable what is going to happen to him.[[ASIN:B000035P5E Eye of the Needle]]

His book provides wonderful insights into the diagnosis, social understanding and friendships, teasing/bullying, expression of emotions, language, cognitive, sensory and movement characteristics, as well as chapters on relationships, life after school and FAQ's.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|i was never a fan of Rush. then i heard the covers thing they did of 60's songs. incredibly well done versions. then i saw a clip of them playing live recently. incredibly tight. very talented. <br />then i heard the 1st song on this album!!! amazing stuff, but would the rest of it hold up? so i bought it yesterday. put it on in the car, confirmed that my reaction to cut #1 wasn't a fluke and, incredibly, found every one of the next 3 as incredible! saved the rest for today and sure enough every cut is THAT good. hot dang! this is gonna stand as tall as whos next and the 1st few zep albums. i kid you not, thats how good it is. a classic, best of the year, probably best straight ahead rock album of the decade so far. weird cause that would make it the greatest rock album of the millenium and that might start to sound like i'm overstating my case..but still...i'm not. this smokes 90% of my collection.

Details his boyhood, early adulthood, and 27 (?) years in prison as a political prisoner of the apartheid government of South  <br />Africa, followed by release and eventual President of the country. The amazing part is how, as President, he avoided revenge and eventually brought  re conciliation to the races.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I love Michael's music. Home is my favorite song on the album because as I listen to it I really feel his need to be with the people he love.

(Anyway, anyone who can master Gershwin's A Foggy Day (In London) gets a fiver from me. Love Gershwin!!!)
0385338694|4.0|`The Undomestic Goddess\\" will satisfy the reader's quench for their Chick Lit fulfillment.   Sure, it may be a little predictable, but who cares.  Kinsella's books are so fun and fluffy and pleasing, that the obvious is transformed into a void filling phenomenon.  <br /> <br />A high-powered lawyer, Samantha Sweeting, ends up working as a housekeeper after being fired wrongly from the best law firm in London.  Samantha has no idea what she is doing--as she doesn't cook or clean or know how to run a vacuum cleaner.  This is what makes the story line funny--one mishap after another--but her employers, Trish and Eddie, find her fascinating.  <br /> <br />Ok--now the interesting part.  Samantha meets the gardener.  I imagine he looks a bit like Bon Jovi--only with an English accent. (Sounds quite nice)  A little flirting, a little sex in the raspberry patch, a little smearing of sticky red sweetness squashing beneath their bodies! <br /> <br />Samantha finds out more about herself being an undomestic goddess than being a high-powered lawyer any day of the week-- For example, how to create from scratch, a lovely homemade loaf of bread.   <br /> <br />No need to go on and on... <br /> <br />I love escaping inside Kinsella's books--The fun, fluff, and chick-like amusement crack me up--even the foreseeable and unsurprising is something, which the reader can depend on and feel secure with.  <br /> <br />Hey, after reading some heavy-duty material, The Undomestic Goddess is welcome medicine for the weary soul.  <br />
B000088E6D|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever. It's so rare that you find a young singer that masters the sounds of the past. Rather than be wrapped up in a lot of different genre's that isn't really all that great, he serenades his listeners with the sounds of yesterday and to be honest, without yesterday there is no today. He doesn't become cliche and that is definite staying power in my music collection. I have all albums ever created by him and I'm happy I heard his music. I can't wait until he does another concert so that I may be the first in line to hear him. (I will sleep outside the ticket booth to get the best tickets. Crazy but anything for REAL talent!!!) Anyone still not so sure about his music, take it from a twenty three year old: BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!!!
B000LAZDQA|4.0|the story was very interesting and informative. the best part of the film was viewing sook yin lee's beautiful body and face. i wish dhe was more visible throughout the film instead of only at the beginning. her acting was good also. i bought another film with her in it. the men in the film did not act as good as her but the story line was interesting. i hope to see more of her in the future.
1582701709|1.0|The Secret is a very beautifully designed book with very little original content. The Law of Attraction is nothing more than \\"Think and Grow Rich\\", repackaged for today's audience. This book, like so many others before it, seems to clearly target people who are poor, alone and desperately unhappy and it focuses almost entirely on acquiring material wealth for the individual. I can't help but wonder if this Law is so powerful, why not show people how to use it to end poverty, to bring more peace and love into the world? Or does the author assume that's what people will do when they have the millions they've always wanted?
0930289234|5.0|This book is everything that is great about graphic novels.  The story is epic, the artwork is packed with detail, and the symbolism within and the narrative itself is top-notch.

I felt that my children and sister could benefit from it as they had been experiencing some setbacks in their life.  Even though I am a family therapist, I try not to give advise to them, but the book and DVD provided all the information they could want in taking care of themselves and their lives. I read the book and watched the DVD and thought it gave some excellent information about not blaming others, but taking responsibility for our lives and making it work..not really a secret, but one not discussed openly.

0316010669|4.0|This is an ideal book for the beach or an airplane ride.  It reads quickly and covers an eclectically wide range of topics: a case of art forgery, the presidency of Warren G Harding, the world of food tasting, an online test for unconscious prejudices, the marketing of New Coke, the Aeron chair, the nature of autism, gender discrimination among classical musicians, the Battle of Chancellorsville and the complete categorization of facial expressions just to name a few that immediately come to mind.<br /><br />As to the supposed main topic there is not a whole lot to say.  Gladwell starts with a case of art forgery and tells how experts could intuitively recognize it.  You may suspect from this that the book would concentrate on the power of intuition.  However, to the extent that the topic comes up, he dwells mainly on the negative aspects - how we can be led astray by unconscious prejudices and superficial impressions.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I share a lot with fellow Rush fans as a lifelong fan and loyal devotee; however, and ironically so, I differ with most Rush fans in the fact that my favorite thing about the band is their evolution into something greater with each successive album along with their increased musicianship. This is ironic to me because most of the lifelong fans seem to long for \\"the old stuff,\\" whatever that means.<br /><br />Counterparts was my favorite for a long time. Test For Echo was good, but didn't top Counterparts. Then came Vapor Trails ... I fell immediately in love with it and declared it the best Rush album ever. Well, after a few listens of Snakes & Arrows, it made the #1 spot on my personal list of favorites.<br /><br />What I love about this album is the same thing I love about each new Rush album, and that's hearing how much the band has evolved and continues to evolve. The depth and textures of the music and the sheer technical complexity amaze me. The songs, however, have a refreshingly \\"clean\\" sound, despite their complexity; and thus is the sheer genius of this album, of the band, and of their new producer.<br /><br />To me, the story of a song is not contained within just the lyrics, but the song itself is the story. What Rush has accomplished here is to make each individual track a story unto itself, and the three instrumental tracks accomplish this even without lyrics. The emotion that one feels just from the music itself is intense. The playing here is very spirited and sincere. This is not the product of a band that is going through the motions because they were overdue to release another album, but of four individuals (band + producer) working together as a whole, from within themselves and not in response to the market, to create something great, something that can stand on its own and really shine in this world of unfortunate mass-production.<br /><br />Lyrically, the album is fiercely anti-religious, something that should come as no surprise to anyone who has paid attention to past Rush lyrics (\\"Freewill\\" and \\"Totem\\" in particular come to mind); however, this is the first time I'm aware of that opposition to organized religion and the damage it can inflict on society has so dominated an album. And the message is timely. I've heard Rush described as \\"The thinking man's rock band,\\" but I prefer to think of them as \\"The free man's rock band\\" with my intense love, desire, and need for personal freedom. My favorite line in the album: \\"I believe in love, and that's faith enough for me,\\" which I can relate to because I have real love in my life and I don't need anything else.<br /><br />In any case, enough of my long-winded review ... the bottom line is that this is as good as it gets!! Like I said, I'm not one of those guys who comes to the shows and yells out \\"We want the old stuff maaaannnnnn!!!\\" Rush to me is about the evolution of their music, and Snakes & Arrows is clearly at the top of the food chain.<br /><br />And, to the band:  If you're reading this (and I know you are, since I'm an author and I read my Amazon reviews religiously and know you do too), my one request on this tour is to hear \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" live!!

B000K7UBTI|5.0|Although there were some changes in the origin of Iron Man, I felt they did a great job of incorporating the past, while bringing into the present. I was convinced that this Tony Stark was the same Stark from the comic books and the same can be said of the other characters. The story and the battle scenes where excellent, however the quality/detail of animation could've been better. Still, I rate this higher than any of the Batman Beyond DVD's, Justice League DVD's, etc. but that's just my taste.
B000MRA5EM|3.0|The DVD's description says \\"for age 3 and up\\" and I agree -- this is a great film to view as a family, to begin discussing how we all need to be good keepers of our earth. Provides good overview of the \\"circle of life\\" and balance in ecosystems between predators and prey. Since it's a short film, it will hold the attention of all but the most squirmy youngsters. But for adults who have viewed a lot of films about sea life, this doesn't provide many highlights -- with the exception of Winslett's lively narration counter-pointed by Depp's relaxed, hypnotic voice ... and Elfman's clever score.

1932907009|5.0|I am a screenwriter, and, yes, I actually make a living selling screenplays. If you want to write a screenplay that everyone loves and nobody buys, read something else. However, if you actually want to write a screenplay that earns you money, \\"Save the Cat\\" is where you should begin. Is it the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need? Probably. But after you read this book, it's not the last book on screenwriting you'll ever want. That's because Blake's insight and humor will leave you wantting more from this author. It's not that he needs to change any of his advice (he definitely doesn't), but he is apparently taking the lessons taught in \\"Save the Cat\\" and showing how they apply to theatrical releases. I can't wait. <br /> <br />As for his resume, anyone who knows anything about screenwriting knows it's extremely difficult to sell a screenplay, even more difficult to get a movie made, and nearly impossible to have anything to do with the script once it leaves your hands and lands in the director's paws. Blake's imdb credits might not be your favorite films, but he is one of the few, if not the only, screenwriting authors who have sold anything much less gotten it made.  <br /> <br />After years of reading virtually every screenwriting book and attending a host of seminars, I can assure you there is nothing better for your career than this book. This is hands down the best book I've ever read on screenwriting. Hell, I even bought the software.

B00005JPD0|4.0|This film has more to it than initially meets the eye.  What seems on its face to be a high-tech crime thriller is so much more.  You'll find a suspenseful, intermittently action-packed story line filled with mind-bending twists (a few of which are admittedly predictable), along with an exceptional balance between gritty realism and sci-fi imagination.<br /><br />Denzel Washington did a somewhat better-than-okay job as ATF agent Doug Carlen.  His character was not especially deep, but he had some great support, including Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, and a wonderfully psychotic Jim Caviezel.  The ending was a bit surprising, but pleasantly so.  The little twist when the last shoe dropped was not something I had expected.  Overall I was moderately impressed with the quality of this effort, and have no trouble recommending it to others for their viewing pleasure.
B00005JPD0|2.0|I like Denzel a lot, but I wish he would recognize a poor script and pass it by. This movie starts with a great opening scene and then steadily descends into a confused tangle of hopeless science fiction and comical references to the \\"Einstein-Rosen Bridge.\\" Overly melodramatic and entirely predictable, the story is saved by the always convincing work of Jim Caviezel as the villian. On the other hand, Washington's acting is unfortunately stereotypical. He really needs to get a new persona - it's no fun to see him adopt the same sly, intense, smirking image that we have seen so many times. Maybe Clint could do it and we loved it, but DW? I don't think so. Ultimately this flick succumbs to its convoluted plot and instead of a gripping movie full of surprises we get a dismal bit of sci-fi confusion.

B0000028M7|5.0|Back when I was young, I enjoyed listening to a ton of 90s bands.  Around 1996, my friends were spitting out music from the recently passed grunge scene including Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and of course...Nirvana (Unplugged) along with a ton of other rock bands of that time (Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, RHCP, etc...) <br /> <br />But there was one band I didn't listen to when I was young.  Alice in Chains.  It was just 1 year ago when I learned about them and decided to get myself acquainted with the band.  I bought the album Dirt after hearing some of their songs on the radio.  After just one viewing, I was hooked.  Not only is this album quite possibly one of the most under-rated/under-appreciated album of all time, but it could be one of the greatest albums of all time.  Almost every single song has a soul to it thanks to the songwriting of Jerry Cantrell as well as vocals by Layne Staley.  Songs like Them Bones and Angry Chair gives the music a darker feel while others like Down in a Hole, Rooster, and Rain When I Die pack in a ton of emotion.  God Smack is another decent track (and very likely the track where the band Godsmack got their name from) <br /> <br />And Dirt isn't just AIC's best music.  There are still the Jar of Flies EP, Facelift, and their Unplugged album (when MTV was still showing music).  All are highly recommended.  Pretty much anyone should give Alice in Chains a listen...I don't care if you are part of the emo scene or the indie scene or still trapped in the 80s with your hair metal, give Alice in Chains a try.  This is the best album really to start with.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is a moving and subversively profound film.  Those who approach it with specific expectations may well find it \\"boring\\", \\"useless\\", or \\"stupid\\".  Others willing to just go with the experience can enjoy the marvelous story telling and affection Tim Burton manages to create.  A treasure of a movie, IMO.
0897500482|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot.  Being a martial arts enthusiast myself, I have read through a great many \\"how-to\\" books and others that tackle the subject, but none come as close to being as prolific and profound as Lee's ideas.  What everyone must understand when reading this is that it is not a step-by-step manual for JKD; in fact, Lee never intended JKD to be a separate martial art in itself.  JKD is an amalgam of different disciplines that a fighter can incorporate into his own practice, depending on the need.  Thus, Lee instructed his students not to teach JKD as a martial art. <br /> <br />The Tao of JKD offers guidance of both mind and body in that when a fighter begins to falter in technique, the mental supplement in these pages should help the fighter find the way back.  In the same way that Lee espouses having no way as a way, I found that a truly pure fighting man should never be bound by walls, especially if a fighter finds him/herself in a life-threatening situation.  Use all means possible, discard conventional methods, and think out of the box.  Given this understanding, it can be argued that Lee's ideas served as a major catalyst for MMA development. <br /> <br />I like what Linda Lee says at the end of her introduction to the book, which is that after one reads through the Tao, the book should be discarded.  I guess Bruce Lee stuck fast to his idea that even his ideas should not be regarded as gospel truth and that one must always be in a continuously absorbent state of mind-- keep learning and be like water.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is not narrated by Weaver, Its David Attenborough. The other guy who got the Weaver version must have gotten the wrong one. This is the series that was on TV spring 2007. Great Series, a must watch for the whole family!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I would not have known about Corinne if it wasnt for my home town jazz station-which told the listeners that she would be on Saturday Night Live.  I had to stay up and hear that song again (Put Your Records On)and see what she looked like.  I heard this fresh new sound and wanted to put a face with it.  I was please to see not only did she have a voice that sounds to me like a cross between jazz and folk, of course a good measure of R&B thrown in, but she could play the guitar!! She is definately the best new artist in my book.
B00030590I|5.0|I bought this movie because I've become interested in the music of Tan Dun, a Chinese composer whose opera TEA is sensational on DVD. There really isn't much of Tan Dun in HERO, but the sound track is extremely artful and effective as a counterpoint to the spectacular cinematography. The visual splendor of this movie is what carries the action (or lack of action) and the actors. The \\"story\\" is complex, intellectually provoking, almost a cultural essay rather than an action flick. The acting is less than subtle -- do I dare say \\"wooden\\" -- except when the computer-assisted ballets of combat erupt. The whole narrative ends in a way that many non-Chinese may find uncomfortable, if they choose to analyze it. Next time I watch, I'm gonna kill the English subtitles (if it's possible) and treat the whole thing as a symphony of sounds and colors.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I had put off seeing this movie because I have been well aware of what has been going on with our impact on this globe.  I was worried, as was my girlfriend, that it would be a movie that would make me feel even more sad about the situation here on Earth.  But.... <br /> <br />The movie was great.  It was not an \\"in your face show you all the environmental disasters til you can't take anymore and are left feeling helpless and so you need to have a drink just to fall asleep that night\\" kind of movie.  Rather, it left me feeling empowered and hopeful and just furthers my desire to keep doing things that will help, to keep talking to people about it, to spark interest in our planet. <br /> <br />Yep, this is a great movie and I am recommending it to everyone regardless of their political background, age, religion, and so on. <br /> <br />See it!  And then tell your friends and family. <br /> <br />Together, we can really turn this situation around.  I know we can!
B00005JM0B|3.0|Passable only extension to the terminator franchise, this serves only to set the stage for more potential films. As a stand alone product it's pretty futile, Sarah has died, John is still living on the fringes whining a lot, a new improved terminator wants him dead and Arnold wants to keep him alive. Much of this repeats stuff you've already seen in T1 & T2, but tamer as they clearly want to keep the rating as low as possible. Scenes that went over well in the first two get recycled almost unchanged in three, it's depressingly derivative.   <br />Linda Hamilton wisely bailed, Arnold needs so much make up to combat the ravages of time he looks rubberised, the new caste members aren't really good enough to take up the load and the jokes are so laboured they creak. It's entertaining enough, but you really wonder why they bothered.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Excellent movie if you want to laugh! Best of the best!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|of the few sub-groups of Rush fans, the ones who annoy me are the \\"Timers\\". For the last 25 years, they've been obsessed with the time lengths of every song.....and for the last 25 years, they've been disappointed & appalled that they didn't get that 75-minute epic they were hoping for, so of course they complain after every new release that Rush is washed up.      Look....there are no epics here, so let's get that out of the way. But if you enjoy Rush songs in the vein of \\"Entre Nous\\", \\"Lessons\\", \\"Witch Hunt\\", and \\"YYZ\\", then you'll probably be able to dive into Snakes & Arrows without much fuss. It's maintains the heavier direction the band has followed since Counterparts, but it's arguably their most organic back-to-basics album as well. As a result, this occasionally lends itself to experimenting with new wrinkles, suggesting the band is still not afraid of trying different things (see the bluesy Lerxst jam in \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\", or the too-quirky acoustic riff in \\"Bravest Face\\", or the Dead-like rhythms in sections of \\"The Main Monkey Business\\", off the top of my head). It's accessible one minute, lean & mean the next, sometimes in the same song.     Where does this album rank among other Rush albums? Who knows....ask me in 10 years. Right now 'tho, it's getting alot of play in my house with no signs of letdown yet. The Timers will hate it, but most of the other fans should be quite satisfied.....4.5 stars.
1400064287|5.0|I buy a lot of business books, but I end up reading very few from cover to cover - probably less than 1 in 50.  I start with the best intentions and stop about half way through.  Then I skim the rest trying to identify the main idea. <br /> <br />This book was different. I started reading Made to Stick book and couldn't put it down.  It was like eating a cold, creamy bowl of ice cream on a hot summer day - I just couldn't stop until it was finished.  And I've already started applying the ideas to my sales presentations and in my consulting business.  This stuff works.  Buy it, read it, use it, and tell others about it.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Definitely worth it! If you love the series, you will love this set :D
B00030590I|5.0|I am truly surprised at the depth and style of some of the other reviewers, that it almost puts me to shame anthing I have to say..<br /><br />This movie is lyrical and impressive.. in a certain way after seeing it, I am reminded of a certain passage of the book \\" Winds of the East, Winds of the West\\"  where the narrator (a chinese woman) comments on a foreign (western)woman visit something like this \\".. I thought people of other nations come to China to be civilized..\\"  .. not that all the killing and politcal squemes of the movie speak of a great civil spirit, but I have the impression that there are some many subtle and not so subtle details that are amiss due to my cultural categories... if not familiar with this director, I envy you.. plunge into this water, you will not regreat it
B000H6SXMY|5.0|There just aren't words. If you love Friends you probably already own this set. If you don't own it yet, shame on you! You should!<br /><br />For any true F.R.I.E.N.D.S. fan, this set is your \\"lobster!\\"
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This movie is great.  Their was absolutly no problems with it at all.  Thank You Amazon.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I can't help but say this is my FAVORITE movie and that I absolutely love it. ever since I got this, I've been watching it almost everyday, except when I had to study for my college final exams. It's amazing that I enjoy it no matter what mood I'm in. It's heart-warming when I'm sad, stress-relieving when I'm angry (especially with Amanda's scenes), and also simply enjoyable in a normal mood. If you're a romantic comedy lover, I strongly recommend you to watch this. If you're a person who loves movies like The Prince and Me, A Walk to Remember, Roman Holiday, JUST WATCH IT. <br /> <br />I was actually surprised (and not surprised) that Nancy Meyers, the director, was the same director of The Parent Trap (1998). I used to love that movie, and watched that over and over when I was younger. Her movies are so sweet, romantic, and they describe women's hearts so well. The conversations in the movies are pretty realistic too, so they don't feel like they only happen in movies. <br /> <br />Okay, I guess I got overly excited about this movie &lt;The Holiday>.. but I must say it again, I love it. I absolutely do :)
B0000A0DRY|5.0|ONE OF THE MOST PSYCHADELIC SOUNDTRACKS OF ALL TIME, JEFFERSON AIRPLANE'S \\"WHITE RABBIT\\" is a 2:47 minute-long song which is mind breaking and hallucinogenous in nature.<br /><br />Originally released in 1967, in the album \\"SURREALISTIC PILLOW\\", during the height of the SUMMER OF LOVE, this song has been part of the soundtracks of renowned movies such as \\"PLATOON\\" (1986) and \\"FEARING AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS\\" (1998), usually being inserted in a drug-related context.<br /><br />Whether characters on the previously mentioned movies are smoking pot or dropping acid, \\"White Rabbit\\" is highly regarded as a song which builds itself through a powerful narrative concerning the experimentation of mind-altering treats and the awkward sensations one gets as the drugs take effect. This idea is clear from the initial lines \\"Ones who make you larger, and Ones who make you small\\", which is arguably a direct association to uppers and downers, who make you feel powerful (larger) or depressed (small).<br /><br />In addition to an intensive description of the side-effects provoked by drug use, the song has made a reputation among counter-culture freaks for providing junkies and hop-heads a powerful mood enhancer. Such intensity is felt as the song reaches its peak or simply when it \\"peaks\\". This part of the song has lead singer Grace Slick singing her lungs out, and thus providing listeners with an extra \\"helping hand\\" to get real high. Acid takers are infamous for always having a tape loaded with tripy tunes from the 60's era at hand. White Rabbit, of course, is one of those tracks.<br /><br />Prior to joining the San Francisco based musical act \\"Jefferson Airplane\\", lead singer Grace Slick had already countlessly performed this song and contemporary hit \\"Somebody To Love\\", in her former band called \\"GREAT SOCIETY\\". Both \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody To Love\\" are arguably JEFFERSON AIRPLANE'S greatest hit tracks in addition to 1969's mega-hit \\"Volunteers\\". \\"Volunteers\\" of course, was part of FORREST GUMP'S soundtrack album particularly the part depicting the 60's era and the U.S's lugubrious involvement in Vietnam.<br /><br />***** - FIVE STARS!!!as part of FORREST GUMP'S soundtrack album particularly the part depicting the 60's era and the U.S's lugubrious involvement in Vietnam. <br /> <br />***** - FIVE STARS!!!
B00005A0V0|5.0|Maybe it could be because I was born in the wrong time, being only 33 years old, this album being a tad older, or maybe being the best kept secret in England's Canterbury district (town), I don't know. But one thing I got to say since I have heard the title song of this album, you don't get sick of it at all and why didn't these guys get as famous or more so than the Pink Floyd. I am a true fan of the singer/bass player Richard Sinclair, very rich and deep with a haunting sound betraying such great songs on this album. Every song on this album deserves recognition:<br /><br />1 Golf Girl 4/5<br /><br />2 Winter Wine 4/5<br /><br />3 Love To Love You 3/5<br /><br />4 In The Land of Grey and Pink 5/5<br /><br />5 Nine Feet Underground 5/5<br /><br />6 I Don't Know Its Name 5/5<br /><br />Etc.....etc....etc....the rest are part of the original songs on this album with a different take on them.<br /><br />  Each one of these gems have a familar sound to it like you've heard it before in another time and it's a good feel. It is almost like Floyd or any progressive sounding material during this time but better, you even hear a little of Yes in here and even funny enough Rare Earth covering a Temptation song in Nine Feet Underground, near the end of the song. This group is really tight and it shows in their music indeed, too bad I didn't hear of them until recently in my life. And if you like this album, you'll like their other album 'If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You', funny name by the way.
B00005JPFH|4.0|The third instalment of this erstwhile-comic-character-turned-flesh-and-blood-superhero comes packed with more thrills, action, and stunts than ever before. But then, that is the good part. The bad part is, there is too much of plots, emotions, villians too... where the earlier two parts had to contend with one bad guy each, this one has more than both of the earlier ones combined!!! Four in all, if you count the black thingy that clings to spidey.<br /><br />However, having said that, there is essentially a coming of age that is shown in this movie, where the character of Peter Parker is shown to finally be able to have a life for himself (well, at least almost!). The story goes along quite well, and... wait... what is that? Oh... the green goblin reappears. Harry dons his father's suit, in a much anticipated sequence, and another much anticipated showdown takes place between Peter and Harry, and... but wait... what is that? Oh... the sandman appears...<br /><br />And so, before you've had time to digest the first subplot of this otherwise marvellous movie, the plot changes. Sad to say but that is precisely and the only aspect that lets the movie down. The acting is as usual - excellent from Tobey and James (Harry), and there are times when Kirsten looks kinda cute! My personal part - goes to Harry Osborne, and I feel sad that a character that had so much potential has been neglected in favor of lesser evil characters, and as such ends up being sidelined.<br /><br />Enough of the spoilers, go and watch the movie... you'll not regret it. For it has some of the fastest action sequences I've seen since... that pod race from SW Ep.1 with little Anakin at the helm!<br /><br />I'd have rated it a 3.5-3.75 actually out of 5, but no such possibility as of now... Till then, Peace!<br /><br />P.S.: Do I hear a S-IV...?
B00004SW9R|5.0|Words can't quite describe this masterpiece, except \\"AWESOME\\". This album is full of twist and delightful sounds, along with eerie trippy moments too. Every song on here has a Louisiana trip on acid 1960's sound to it, totally into it. It might be too much for normal run in of normal radio airplay people, probally shouldn't buy it cause it might bleed the head a little, but if you like to explore beyond the norm, it's worth it.<br /><br />1 Gris-Gris 5/5 awesome<br /><br />2 Danse Kalinda Ba Doom 4/5 lots of toungue speaking hear<br /><br />3 Mama Roux 5/5 mellow psychedelia, very smooth<br /><br />4 Danse Fambeaux 4/5 very odd...trippy to the 5th dimension<br /><br />5 Crocker Courtbullion 5/5 .trippy to the 6th dimension<br /><br />6 Jump Sturdy 4/5 Good<br /><br />7 I Walk On Guilded Splinters 5/5 been abused by other so-call artists, wanabees, but either way, the original makes up for it completely.<br /><br />That's it in a nutshell...just plain awesome.
B000G2YD3C|5.0|Just take a look at the name-checks of the 7 reviewers who have already shared their thoughts (Porcupine Tree/Pink Floyd/RPWL/Pineapple Thief/Riverside/Opeth/Radiohead). That sure makes for mouth-watering listening. Even Beach Boys and Nirvana were thrown in. That's what this CD does to you. I have a few more name-checks that spring to mind in parts on the Album. They are Blow Up Hollywood (Especially the quieter piano parts on the CD Opener Aeropause), early 70s Moody Blues Multi Vocal harmonies at times, Melting Euphoria programming Special effects in places, and Platinum Fleetwood Mac Vocal harmonies in places too (Most notably Christine McVie). There is an Enya type feel on the epic second track, Goshen's Remains as well. However, there is one band I am suprised that has not been mentioned in similarity, and that is Mostly Autumn. I am a big fan of Mostly Autumn but these guys are so much better, especially in the male vocals department. That is the amazing thing about this album. You cant simply break them down as they are all over the place. Someone also mentioned they are like Porcupine Tree's in their lighter moments. I agree to a point, but for me, the Porcupine Tree album in question is \\"Stupid Dream\\" (Most notably the Climatic guitar pieces). Same goes with Riverside. The album flows beautifully from start to finish, and as has been mentionned, there is a hidden track at the end of the last track after 5 minutes of silence.  I dont know why bands do this (Pineapple Thief has done it as well for instance). It should have been shown as Track 10. I wouldnt have known about it had I not read another reviewers comment. There are 2 versions of \\"The Dark Third\\" CD. On this CD, you will see the tracks above but on the imported version (Same artwork but different colour) tracks 5 and 8 have been replaced by the songs \\"The exact Colour\\" and The Twyncyn/Trembling Willows\\". I am fortunate to own the double version of The Dark Third and can point out some interestingpoints. The so called hidden track mentioned is titled \\"Asleep under Eiderdown\\" as it features on the Bonus CD. Also featured on the EP are I. Nimos and Tambos (again) II The Twyncyn/Trembling Willows III Asleep under Eiderdown (Hidden Track as mentioned) and IV In Aurelia. However, although it is not mentioned on the sleeve, there is a fifth track being Arrival/The intention Craft (again). The songs not featured here on the full length CD are not as memorable and at the same time not as derivative. Perhaps it has to do with the Production. On the intro of \\"The Twyncyn\\", the heavy drumming vibe was very Bonhamesque circa \\"Kashmir\\". I especially love the Angelic Choir like harmonies, and the use of the Spocks Beard/Gentle Giant (God! 2 more bands mentioned) type multi layered vocals.  This band is Special. VERY SPECIAL. I have seen Porcupine Tree on their last 3 Album Tours, but missed the current tour, and what makes me really sad is that Pure REason Revolution are currently supporting them. This CD is constantly playing in my deck, and will do so for quite a while (At least till the next PRR CD comes out). Definitely my favourite album of the year so far. Nuff said.
B000LC55F2|5.0|For starters, this was probably one of the best films of 2006.  There's something about this movie that's addicting, it makes you want to watch  it over and over again, and make sure you noticed everything and understood the plot completely the first time you watched it.  I know I had to watch it twice before I understood everything entirely.  This movie has so many delicious twists and turns in it...It just makes you want more.  It's unlike any other movie, in my opinion.  I must say that it is a little too dark, dreary, bleak, and morbid.  But, some people really like that.  But the extent that the creators of this film take the darkness to just doesn't appeal to me.  Christian Bale's performance is outstanding, as is Hugh Jackman's.  The story is great, the acting is great, the directing is great, I think anyone who sees this will have to admit that it is at least very well-done, even if they dont like the morbid feeling that this movie gives its viewers. <br />Give this movie a chance and buy it, I doubt that you'll regret it; no matter who you are or what you like.
B000NA287A|5.0|David Bowie-Scary Monsters ****<br /><br />Released in 1980, David Bowies Scary Monsters became one of his biggest and most popular albums to date. Expanding even further on his new wave sound which he and Iggy Pop helped to invent some four years before this album. The album helped to usher Bowie into the 1980's a decade that would serve Bowie highs higher then he had seen before and lows lower then he had seen before.<br /><br />Scary Monsters is an album of ideas and creativity. Some of Bowies most inspired and original work appears on this album showcasing early influences for many of the alternative bands to imerge during the decade. The lyrics on the album are more then just simple lyrics, they are really the vocal point of the album which is a first for a Bowie album. He has always been known as an amaznig lyricist but Scary Monsters secured him as among the best.<br /><br />The line up of musicians is amazing with guest apperances from the great Pete Townshend, King Crimson leader and guitar virtuoso Robert Fripp, as well as piano great Roy Bittan, and legend Tony Visconti, but the phenomonal Tom Verlaine of Television lent his hands at some of the albums lyrics.<br /><br />'Its No Game (Part 1)' is a strange song, but actually a great way to open the album being as it is a little strange as a whole. With no chorus or really a hook for the matter the song is sung in strange octives and features lots of Janpanese spoken word inbetween verses. No other song would have started the album better. Also contains great socialy concious lyrics. 'Up The Hill Backwards' is very child hood sing-along. While once again the lyrics are great they loose their effect being performed over such nursery ryhme music and in a sing-along way. The track is take it or leave it. The title track 'Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)' is one of the best songs on the album. With a very different sound and though the song sounds very 80's it still has a great appeal. 'Ashes To Ashes' is easily the best song on the album and one of Bowies all time best songs. Fantastic keyboard and minimal drumming make the mood of the song soom very errie. The lyrics are some of the best ever written in history. Part two of the contiueing sega of 'Major Tom.' In this sequal to the original we find out that 'Major Tom' is not in space at all but mearly strung out on Heroin. A great song, truly a classic. 'Fashion' is one of the most inventive songs of Bowies career. Combining some incredible guitar playing from Fripp and a new wave feel and sound that would revolutionize the comming decade. 'Teenage Wildlife' may contain the very best lyrics Bowie has ever written. The vocal delivery is so heart felt and emotional that you truly understand and feel what he is trying to convey. The guitar work from Fripp is inspired and complaments the lyrics perfectly. One of the most honest and truly geniune songs ever written. 'Scream Like A Baby' is almost a hard rocker. Slightly intence with some restraint as too not get way out of controle. 'Kingdom Come' is a song that was written by Tom Verlaine of Television and it is so clear when you hear it beacuse it totaly sounds as if it would fit in on the bands debut. A great perfomance from Bowie here. 'Because Your Young' features lead guitar from Pete Townshend which adds to the song and makes it better. Other then the guitar this is not one of the better songs on the album, in fact the album may have been stronger had it been left off. Closing the album is 'Its Not Game (Part 2)' which is nothing like part one which opens the albums. This is much more laid back. A calm after the store or more like a cigerette after a night cap is more in line. A great tune to end the album nicly and ease the listener away.<br /><br />Scary Monsters is not the best album that David Bowie ever recorded but from the 1980's this is the best he has to offer. The music is phenomonal, this is an album you will never get bored with or grow old of. The artwork in the case of the album is worth the price of the album alone, usualy I dont comment on the artwork but it is truly breath taking. So for those how are looking at this you are sligtly interested and that is a good enough reason to buy the album if this review wasnt reason enough.old of.

I don't know exactly what drew me to this book but I think the title was a big part of it.. it just sounds like a really cool book.. This is the first book that I have read by Kurt Vonnegut and since he just passed away recently I thought there was no better time then to read something by him.. and I had Slaughterhouse Five on my shelf..<br /><br />Slaughterhouse Five well what can I say.. Honestly I didn't really understand alot of this book.. not alot of it clicked.. it seemed like it was scattered all over the place to where it was very hard to follow exactly what was going on.. The whole idea that I picked up in this book is a mind that is unstable in the state of war.. it's hard to think clearly and be straight in a time when war breaks loose.. and maybe that was the intent on why it was written in this type of way.. so you can see what happens to the human mind when war occurs..<br /><br />\\"The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamodorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.\\"<br /><br />\\"When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad conidition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments, Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians says about dead people, which is 'So it goes.'\\"<br /><br />I'm pretty sure this is the type of book that needs to be reread in order to really sink it in.. and since I have just read it once.. maybe that's a reason why it just didn't do much for me..

The lyrics are some of the best ever written in history. Part two of the contiueing sega of 'Major Tom.' In this sequal to the original we find out that 'Major Tom' is not in space at all but mearly strung out on Heroin. A great song, truly a classic. 'Fashion' is one of the most inventive songs of Bowies career. Combining some incredible guitar playing from Fripp and a new wave feel and sound that would revolutionize the comming decade. 'Teenage Wildlife' may contain the very best lyrics Bowie has ever written. The vocal delivery is so heart felt and emotional that you truly understand and feel what he is trying to convey. The guitar work from Fripp is inspired and complaments the lyrics perfectly. One of the most honest and truly geniune songs ever written. 'Scream Like A Baby' is almost a hard rocker. Slightly intence with some restraint as too not get way out of controle. 'Kingdom Come' is a song that was written by Tom Verlaine of Television and it is so clear when you hear it beacuse it totaly sounds as if it would fit in on the bands debut. A great perfomance from Bowie here. 'Because Your Young' features lead guitar from Pete Townshend which adds to the song and makes it better. Other then the guitar this is not one of the better songs on the album, in fact the album may have been stronger had it been left off. Closing the album is 'Its Not Game (Part 2)' which is nothing like part one which opens the albums. This is much more laid back. A calm after the store or more like a cigerette after a night cap is more in line. A great tune to end the album nicly and ease the listener away.<br /><br />Scary Monsters is not the best album that David Bowie ever recorded but from the 1980's this is the best he has to offer. The music is phenomonal, this is an album you will never get bored with or grow old of. The artwork in the case of the album is worth the price of the album alone, usualy I dont comment on the artwork but it is truly breath taking. So for those how are looking at this you are sligtly interested and that is a good enough reason to buy the album if this review wasnt reason enough.old of.

B000O75F7C|3.0|I only discovered PT about a year ago, but I now own a number of their releases.  There are some absolute gems on In Absentia (ie Blackest Eyes) and Deadwing (ie Arriving Somewhere), but not on this one (though a couple come close).  As an earlier reviewer noted, it takes some time for this release to grow on you, unlike the previous two.  As with Deadwing, I find that you have to get past the first couple cuts to get to the best work.  My favorite cut is actually Way Out Of Here followed by Sentimental. <br /> <br />There is just a certain flatness to the music, with very little punch except in parts.  It contemplates more than it rocks.
B0000009S3|5.0|Frank Zappa-Hot Rats *****<br /><br />In early 1969 Frank Zappa decided to leave the original Mothers Of Invention behind and strike it out on his own. Hot Rats was Frank Zappa's very first solo album away from the great Mothers Of Invention, and it turned out being one of his greatest triumphs with or without The Mothers. This mostly instrumental album with the exception of 'Willie The Pimp.' A mixture of large soundscapes and jazz fusion and smooth jazz thrown angerly against a wall of rock n' roll is the best way to describe the sound of Hot Rats.<br /><br />Frank Zappa and Ian Underwood are the only musicians to play on every piece of music. ''Piece of music'' you ask why? Well becuase it is just unfair to call the tracks on the album songs that is why. Zappa comes alive on this album proving that he is unofficialy the worlds most underrated and overlooked guitar player, as well as bass player but more so on guitar. Zappa also lends a hand to the percussion on the album. Underwood the multi musician he is lends his lips to almost all of the horns on the album and plays most of the piano. Hot Rats is also the album that first showed the world what a magnificient musical arranger that Frank Zappa was. His ear for notes and sounds, and his comprehension of complex time signatures shines brightly through this album like the tecnicolor dream coat.<br /><br />'Peaches En Regalia' opens the album and this strange piece of music managed to become one of Zappas best known pieces. Heavy in acoustic guitar with an amazing classical guitar solo from Zappa, and loads of organ and horns from Underwood. Also one of the mans most beautiful recordings as well, arranged like a mini symphony 'Peaches En Regalia' is one of the best reasons why Zappa is loved by his fans so strongly.<br /><br />The only vocal track on the album 'Willie The Pimp' contains vocals from the legendary Captain Beefheart. The track opens with incendiary violen playing from Sugar Cane Harris which really adds to the over all sound of the album making this one of the most original tracks Zappa had done up to this point. This is the very first song to show the world what a fantasticly talentedly vituiosic guitar player Zappa was. His solos over the track are insane and I dare anyone to say Zappa is not one of the worlds top ten guitar players after hearing it.<br /><br />'Son Of Mr. Green Genes' is a more happy sounding piece with lots of keyboards and is very jazzy. Once again Zappa plays some pehnomonal guitar using his wah-wah pedal not as a wah-wah sound but to get a midrange alternate sound to his guitar. Playing in odd tunings and using unusual chords and changes the mans playing make this one of the more interesting tracks on the album.<br /><br />'Little Umbrellas' is randomly short for this album, be careful you might miss it if your not paying attention. Lots of great piano work and incredible horns make this track short and sweet.<br /><br />'The Gumbo Variations'  might just be the very best thing that Frank Zappa ever recorded with anyone. It is nearly seventeen minutes long and is fantastic from start to finish with never a dull moment. Before when the album was released on vinyl the song was not able to be released in its full length because of the length but now you get the full piece. The guitar interplay with Zappa and Underwoods horns is outragious. The track is beyond phenomonal, A measterpiece if you will.<br /><br />'It must Be A Camel' closes the album and does so effortlesly. The random time changes and signatures through out make this a non stop thrill ride. Incredible, it is as if Zappa wrote the piece to close the album on pupose so to perfectly seague out.<br /><br />This album is the penicle of Frank Zappa. This is the quintessential Zappa album, the one that you must own to call yourself a fan, the one you must own even if your not a fan.which really adds to the over all sound of the album making this one of the most original tracks Zappa had done up to this point.

B000000I3O|5.0|Misfits *****<br /><br />One of the great punk bands of all time was only great for a few years. The Misfits are easily on eof the all time best punk bands and really one of the best bands of all time from any genre. Glen Danzig the bands frontman and lead singerfronted the band in the late 1970's and early 1980's until he left the band to form Samhain. Danzig was really the driving force behind the band, writing most of the songs and arranging everything, also his voice is one of the most recongnizable in all of rock n' roll history. So when he left the band in the mid 1980's the band did continue on but they were never the same. Hardcore fans never felt the same abou thte band again and while they still sang about the same things and looked and played the same The Misfits were never really The Misfits again.<br /><br />This collection along with collection II do the best to offer the best of the band during the Danzig era, covering the albums Walks Among Us, Static Age, and Earth A.D. And while both collections are a great way to showcase the band, especially together they are a great way to introduce someone to the band. Sepperatly this is the essential way to get to know The Misfits because it basically contains it all. II is a good intro as well but more of the bands classic songs are here such as 'Bullet' 'Horror Buisness' 'Die, Die My Darling' 'Where Eagles Dare' and 'She' are all here.<br /><br />From start to finish you are continusely introduced to classic after classic track by this legandary band. The Misfits were one of the greatest bands in all of punk as well as one of the most influential. Their influence transended genres like Metal (Metallica, All That Remains) of course punk (AFI). They sang about horror movies and jokingly sang about them in a happy way. It is just too band Danzig started to belieave in his lyrics to much forcing him to leave the band.<br /><br />If you are remotley interested in The Misfits this is the one to get. All the before mentioned albums with Danzig on them are worth the money but if you just want one to cover the band then this is the perfect thing for you.. All the before mentioned albums with Danzig on them are worth the money but if you just want one to cover the band then this is the perfect thing for you.
0743298020|5.0|I am not one who reads fiction very often, but this book may change that. From the first page a was surprised at the ease this book was absorbed.  All of the characters are well developed and you will love how all of the loose ends are neatly tied together within the last 30 pages.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I realized that Rush cd's these days take several listens. The band has always been very complex and you sometimes have to get through the many layers to hear to the final product. To me not every Rush album gets five stars. The band definetly has evolved over the years and thats a good thing. What matters is this band has always had a lot of heart in their music and thats very important these days. One thing I did find interesting on this cd was three instrumentals. To the surprise of most people I found \\"Vapor Trails\\" to be one of their best cd's. All in all this is good effort.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The producer was able to remix the songs so as to add zip without undermining the originals. If you like the Beatles, you'll like the album. If you're not a fan, you may just like the album anyway.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|Having liked the previous animations done by Lionsgate (Avengers 1 & 2), I was expecting something better from this Iron Man production.  Unfortunately, the story takes like forever to come to one of its highly anticipated moments (Tony donning the Iron Man suit).  Afterwards, there are few moments in the storyline that could really leave you in awe. <br /> <br />For my taste, the only parts where I liked what I saw, was some (not all) of the CGI-induced animation, where some of the movements were very life-like. <br /> <br />I saw this downer just yesterday, and to tell you the truth, I already forgot pretty much of everything that happened in the story!!  Pitiful! <br /> <br />I'll take this space to HIGHLY recommend JUstice League Unlimited, Season 1.  A GREAT surprise, indeed! <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br />
B00000720W|5.0|Awesome album from the Black Metal Gods Mayhem.  Short but nothing short of amazing.
B000NA28IE|2.0|ERAGON is one of those films that makes Sci-Fi and Fantasy lovers cringe. It is plainly a horrifically done adaption of Christopher Paolini's book by the same name, slashing vital plots into nothingness, showing forced performances by some the best actors of our time (the most noteworthy being John Malkovich), and producing a main character (Eragon played by Edward Speelers) who grows too fast and is rarely sympathetic in the short 104 minutes of the entire film.<br /><br />Note that time: 104 minutes. Chris Paolini wrote Eragon as a sort of epic, brandishing derivative works such as Tolkien's [[ASIN:0618640150 The Lord of the Rings]] series and McCaffrey's [[ASIN:0345340248 Dragonriders of Pern]] stories. But Paolini was only fifteen when he started writing it, so quite a bit of leeway was given to him because of youthful inexperience. He did create an interesting world, but the book was lukewarm at best (in my opinion) yet sparked the imagination of younger readers. Perhaps his book could be considered a gateway to the more in-depth novels by Tolkien, McCaffrey, and the other great fantasy authors. Regardless, his \\"epic\\" was slashed to 104 minutes ...although the ending of this movie certainly leaves it open for a sequel even though there's NOTHING on the film radar/horizon to suggest one is coming. Which pretty much leaves this flick dead in the water. Dropping off plots in order to wedge the story into a certain time-frame for a certain audience has proved disastrous time after time. [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings movies]] (178 min., 179 min., and 201 min. respectively), [[ASIN:B000E8M0VA The Chronicles of Narnia]] (143 min.) and many, many other lengthy films proved this. Although they did make alterations to the literary works, they kept almost all of the plots intact. Of course longer movies mean more costs for the production studio, too.<br /><br />So the first big strike against Eragon is its short length in comparison to the depth the novel gave us.<br /><br />The second is the acting. When the best job is done by a CGI character who's voiced by Rachel Weisz ([[ASIN:B000EU1PXM The Constant Gardner]]), you know there's a problem. Her Saphira voice-over is done well, leaving all the other actors/actresses in the dust. Although Jeremy Irons ([[ASIN:B000EDWKXI Casanova]]) does a middlin' job as the old dragonrider Brom, it most certainly isn't his most shining moment on celluloid. Many of his lines are stilted and sound as if he's afraid to use more than five words in a sentence. From here, the acting takes a serious nosedive into oblivion. Newbie Edward Speelers as Eragon is rip-your-eyes-out bad. You can tell he's trying way to hard to make his character empathetic and interesting but the script wouldn't allow it. Sienna Guillory as the magical Arya is practically unknown to the viewer, never letting us know why she, of all people, is carrying something so important through such a dangerous land. Robert Carlyle as the dastardly Duza is probably the most forced evil character you'll ever see, making you laugh at him more than fear him.<br /><br />The best quality within the movie was the CGI. The images were rendered exceptionally well and the dragon Saphira has a very authentic look to her (which was good considering how much time she's onscreen).<br /><br />If you loved Paolini's Eragon novel, you'll probably screech in dismay at this adaption.

B000BCE918|5.0|I love all 3 Jurassic Park films and I hope they make more, thus I was very pleased to see the trilogy in a nice boxset with lots of extras.  What else can be said about these great movies, all three films, lots of extras and a nice non space consuming box design, win win!!!
0375423966|4.0|Persepolis is a great story about a liberal Iranian family and their attempts to educate their daughter. My only issue with it, is that it fails to tackle the other side of the arguement. Satrapi never depecits or even tries to understand the conservative moral forces that she is attempting to escape. While it's an interesting story, it further enforces the voice of the West in the middle east's narrative instead of providing a valuable balance of opinion. But ya know that's a minor imperfection in what is an a fascinating auto-biography told in charming and humorous episodues.
B000NA77YO|5.0|Great set list and the three new songs prove why DIO is still the best thing to ever happen to Sabbath, hope they stick together this time or at least make another album.  Leave Ozzy making solo albums, DIO is and always was Sabbath's future.
B000O178BY|5.0|Giving it five stars just cause its Nine Inch Nails.  There are really not too many classics on this that'll get stuck in your head.  I'm anticipating the moment when the songs eventually will grow on me.  Reznor has that magic power to do that to us.  I thought With Teeth wouldn't do the trick, but it turns out it definetely did! <br />New stuff for 2007 that I would recommend over this though is Rush's Snakes and Arrows, Porcupine Tree's Fear of a Blank Planet, and even Type O's Dead Again/ Megadeth's United Abominations.
B000JBWWQ0|1.0|This is the most embarrasing film I have ever seen, and I'm pretty certain that I won't see anything this embarrasing for the rest of my life.  Everything is embarrasing: the acting, the plot (plot? what plot?), the scenery, the special effects (special??), everything.  And for those who claim it has a profound message: the author made up all the story, there's no such thing as these prophecy rolls!  Come on, this cliche is what you'd call profound message?  What a shame.
B000O75F7C|5.0|This is a breathe of fresh air.  Dark and beautiful, musically, lyrically.  Only six songs, but they are worth the while.  These guys have many other great songs before this as well.  (No surprise) <br />This is definetely one of the best of 2007 along with Rush's Snakes and Arrows.  If you are big on Tool and Placebo, I reccomend this to compliment your collections.
0316010669|5.0|The idea is that with the correct knowledge base experts can \\"thin-slice\\" data to come to a determination about the authenticity of a piece of art, read the dynamics between married couples to determine survival rates and determine market share for products based on consumer data. <br /> <br />This is an incredible read. Very quick. Educational and entertaining. <br /> <br />Interestingly enough, when I read it my take on it was that everyone can learn to \\"thin-slice\\". But like another reviewer, a friend of mine who read it thought that the book showed you that you need to be an expert before you can \\"thin-slice\\" otherwise you are relying on faulty intuition. <br /> <br />I think your conclusion about \\"thin-slicing\\" is based on your perceptions of how data can be boiled down to a quick judgement whether you are an expert or not.  <br /> <br />Absolutely fascinating!

B00005JPFF|5.0|Oh, Man this was an awesome movie, it had more touching sense in this one than the first one, well thats good. they are making spider-man like real life events. And the best part is that Spider-Man's most deadly foe Venom is in it. Oh and don't forget Sandman, which one character i wasn't sure of but sam Puled it off. and don't forget the return of the green goblin, or in this case he is Called New Goblin, the three movies stuck to the origin of the green goblin on how Norman becomes the goblin, dies and urges harry to become the new goblin and succeds. and i'm very happy that they stuck with the original cast. I Love J.K. Simmons as JJ. he acts and looks like the character. I Hope if they make a 4th film that saM Puts Scorpion in it. I know they were talkning about carnage that would be sweet and Tobey McGuire better not quit. And all ther other actors better not quit. If they do i know the movie will go down hill. And sam Raimi better not quit either.  Well I hope they  do make number 4. Oh The Guy who played sandman was awesome and Venom Rules. They could've not picked Better Actors To Play those Characters.

0312360266|3.0|I didnt think this book lived up to the hype. Yes, it was good and the characters were great but halfway through I found the pace completely tapered off. It seemed long, drawn out and sorta pointless. I like the writers, their unique take on vamps and whatever's going on the Zoey and Erik but I will NOT be spending 8.95 on the next in this series. If I pick it up at all it will be used and for the lowest price I can find.

B000MG1ZG0|4.0|This latest release of the remastered tracks in Morrison Hotel and the ten bonus tracks is astounding in some places and dull in others.  But one could never expect the near-perfection of their first two albums to be rivalled by the follow-ups.  But still, Morrison Hotel, especially this remastering, is a great spiritual victory for Doors fans and for the surviving band members, producers and engineers.<br /><br />The long liner-notes are a must read for those of us too lazy to read whole books on the doors.  Indeed, if one reads the liners to all these re-releases, one will get a tremendous and condenced and poetic sense of the doors and their mission.  Just because the Doors were egomaniacs, and just because they were rather primitive musically, does not mean that they were not giants.  Critics often make the mistake of believing that skill, professionalism and accurate self-assessments are some profoundly determining factor in art.  They are not.  Many of the most competent and sane folks on the planet are also the dullest and finally the most discouraging.<br /><br />Doors believers, of which I am one, having been a real member of the now dormant \\"Church of The Doors,\\" can truly take solace in this re-release series.  The focus on the multiple takes of Roadhouse Blues reveals not only a certain lack of technical talent, but also a wonderful and child-like curiosity and experimentalism, which, finally, is more important that excellent craftsmanship.  Sorry, you classical music didacticians and cynical, nihilist rock critics.<br /><br />One great gift on this album that bears retelling is the simplistic and Wagnerian \\"Waiting for The Sun.\\"  The song was dumped from the album which bears its name, and one can see why, because it's a rather half-complete concept.  However, as the graces would have it, many projects in which the gods cut us short are the best ones.  This song, had they thought it out too much, would have lost its wondrous simplicity.  True, they only put it on this record because they were in a bit of a slump, but, astounding, it's rather fun and has an almost early british invasion meets the Ventures kind of all-wrongness that comes out just magestically.<br /><br />Another forgotten and underated song is \\"The Spy,\\" which is really fantastic even though they could only think of one verse and simply repeated it over and over again.  But, as one commericial songwriter I know, one who has sold tens of thousands of albums once said, \\"The problem with certain songs is that they only have one verse, but that often ends up being the whole genius of them.\\"<br /><br />Indian Summer is another almost Half-Song which, if the Doors had felt like they were on a hot streak, might have never let see the light of day.  But, as it is, the song is nearly a nursery rhyme, one that is amazingly powerful in its innocense.<br /><br />The truth was, Jim Morrison was not really a singer.  And, as snobby literary critics love to point out, was not the great poet that he thought he was.  But, as Cosmic Fate would have it, had he been a true professional at either, the whole force of Jim Morrison's massive, albeit flawed, character would never have created the half-century stir that they have.  Genius is not what great craftsman do with their natural talents, it's what people with big gaps in their talent do to make up for it.  (A concept I stole from Vonnegut's Bluebeard.)<br /><br />Morrison Hotel caught The Doors right in an awkward middle of their career, but even so, this re-release is just a fabulous gift to us all.y only put it on this record because they were in a bit of a slump, but, astounding, it's rather fun and has an almost early british invasion meets the Ventures kind of all-wrongness that comes out just magestically. <br /> <br />Another forgotten and underated song is \\"The Spy,\\" which is really fantastic even though they could only think of one verse and simply repeated it over and over again.

B000K7UBTI|5.0|I don't agree with some of the other revewers on this one. this movie rocked I can't wait to see the live action Iron Man movie coming out next year. So far most of the marvel movies stuck true to the comic books, Except the Hulk i can't understand why Stan Lee let Ang Lee screw that movie up big time, Ho well Mabey The Incedeble Hulk will be Better. All in All Iron Man rules!
B000M341QE|4.0|This movie is a great one to watch for anybody that likes a bit of action. The plot's great, the actors do a very nice job (DiCaprio actually does some great acting, even after he threw a funny African accent in Blood Diamond), and the music blended with the movie very well. Of course, you gotta like Nicholson. I can't tell if the man is really off his rocker or if he's just one heck of a good actor. He's ruthless and cruel, yet his role as an Irish mob boss is pretty much perfect. I was so glad that this film won so many awards.
B00005KHJR|5.0|I don't write reviews very often because while I'm a movie buff, I don't usually take the time to pontificate. But having seen the 2006 version of Wicker Man on DVD, I feel the need to make a few observations.<br /><br />First, on the positive side:  certainly the production values of the new version are far superior to the original. It is an extremely well-crafted motion picture. The exterior shots were especially beautiful and made me want to revisit British Columbia.<br /><br />At the end of the film, Ellen Burstyn's makeup and costume were a lot more convincing than Christopher Lee's getup in the original version! Even back when I first saw it in the theatre, Lee just didn't quite seem believable.<br /><br />Having said this, I have serious problems with the remake. First, one of the things that made the original such an interesting film was the use of Celtic folk music. (The film takes place on Summerville Isle off the coast of Britain.) While the lyrics certainly qualify as bawdy, they are entirely appropriate to the setting of the story. The total absence of this and the orchestral score in the current version diminished both the intensity and the message of the film.<br /><br />The real problem however is found in the dialog where Sister Summersisle tells Edward Malus he is to be a martyr. The dictionary describes a martyr as a person who is killed because of his or her religious or other beliefs. But as far as we know, Malus doesn't really have any religious convictions. He may be a sacrifice, but he's no martyr.<br /><br />This brings us to the thrust of the original picture. The message was the battle between British forms of Christianity and Paganism. Both are done a serious disservice by the current version. In the original version, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is a passionately devoted conservative Christian. Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) is an equally committed pagan.<br /><br />As in the current version, the police officer is tricked into coming to the island for the purpose of being sacrificed because the crops have failed. He is chosen because of his very commitment to his faith and the fact that, due to this commitment, he remains a virgin. (And yes, I know, no matter how good an actor Cage is, nobody would believe he has remained sexually pure.) So Howie as a believer represents the perfect fool for these pagans and therefore the perfect sacrifice and martyr. Sergeant Howie, unlike Malus, actually dies for a reason. Malus just dies. And while Malus has no answers for Sister Summersisle, Howie certainly has them for Lord Summerisle.  As Howie dies for his faith, he warns Summerisle that the next time the crop fails, it will be Lord Summerisle himself burning inside the Wicker Man.<br /><br />The 1973 version ends with a man of honor dying for his faith and the warning that it is only a matter of time before the meaninglessness of the sacrifice will become apparent.  In the `06 revised version's ending, we are left with a dead man and nothing more.<br /><br />If you have only seen the current version of Wicker Man, I strongly suggest you view the original. If you ignore the picture's dated aspects, you will find a film with great depth which presents a highly compelling and far more accurate picture of people of faith, be they Christian or pagan.tricked into coming to the island for the purpose of being sacrificed because the crops have failed.

B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This film was just flat out enticing. I have watched it over and over again, and it never seems to lose its value. Crowe is a great actor, and pulls off his role with perfection. This is one of my most favorite movies ever, and is one of the very few that ever made me tear up. Some may find the beginning to be a little slow, but after about twenty minutes of watching, you'll be hooked. Don't miss this one!!!
B000EHSVOG|4.0|So \\"The Towering Inferno\\" is not a great movie.  It's barely a good movie, although at the time of its release, it was considered one of the best of the disaster flicks.  The script is formulaic (to say the least):  Paul Newman designs a 135-story skyscraper in San Francisco.  William Holden is the builder, but his penny pinching son (Richard Chamberlain) cuts one too many corners, and the next thing you know, poof!  Some wires get crossed and there is a fire in the equipment room.  Sweeping in to manage the scene is Steve McQueen, the fire chief.  As is the case with this genre, the film is a veritable cavalcade of celebrities:  Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, Robert Wagner and Susan Blakely, to name a few.<br /><br />But it all comes down to Paul and Steve.  You can't help but wonder what those boys would have done with a decent script and film.  Still, \\"The Towering Inferno\\" is enjoyable cheese.  And sometimes, that's just the sort of movie you need.
0060594888|5.0|If you are looking for ONE book to change your life. This is it. It is so all encompassing that you can stop looking for excuses (and other books) and get on with improving your life. That said, it isn't easy. I don't really think most people are capable of changing that much. This is your ticket if you seriously want to try though. You don't have to wait for a tragedy or to be down and out to use this. You have to believe that you are capable of shaping your destiny. You may need to read this many times, but a single page can change things IF you do the work. It comes down to changing your thoughts. There really aren't any excuses after this. It's totally up to you if you want to a life you never imagined possible before. Obviously there's always going to be 2 steps forward, 1 step back, but it's like the old saying:\\"fall down 7 times, get up 8\\". This is the real deal. There is nothing else like it. : >
630460288X|3.0|This is the only Sylvester Stallone movie I ever saw in its entirety, and that was because I was stuck on a bus trip between Chengdu and Chongking.  It is pure formula junk, with not a jot of originality or anything that rises about banal violence, simplistic good guys and bad guys, and spectacular effects.  I would not recommend this to anyone who wants more than the crudest, most brainless Hollywood entertainment, but then, that is why I have avoided Stallone films.
B00012FXB8|4.0|There are two problems with this movie. First it followed Aliens probably the best sequel of all time. Also one of the most crowd pleasing movies ever. The only other thing wrong with this movie is the CGI Alien which has not aged well.<br /><br />I think that David Fincher did a great job with this movie. He could not make the same movie as Aliens so he went and made a completely different movie. This as a viewer is not what my heart wants to see, but my mind is applauding him for this decision. When the Alien is not in CGI form I think it looks great in this movie. It also is a new kind of Alien born from an animal not a human. The look and feel of the movie is depressing right from the start with Hicks and Newt being killed in the opening credits.  Many fans of then series were upset that the filmakers did this. However if they have survived the crash how realistic would it be that both Hicks and Newt would survive another movie so at least one of them would have to have been killed during this movie.<br /><br />This DVD release is a must have for any Alien fan no matter how much you  hated this movie you should at least once watch what a different movie it was before FOX gutted it. Most DVD's say \\"unrated\\" or \\"directors cut\\" But it is actually like 2 seconds longer than the regular movie. The different version of this movie cannot be considered a directors cut but it is more than a half hour longer and has major differences in the plot. Aliens was a great movie but as a fan I have to move on. I love movies that aren't what you expect them to be like Alien 3, so at least watch the different version. You aren't going to love it like Aliens but you should at least respect an original look at familar characters.
B000002UAX|5.0|Great album, but it should've been one album, they had too much [...] for a double.  The one album should be:  \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\"  \\"Dear Prudence\\"  \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\"  \\"Wild Honey Pie\\"*  \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\"  \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\"  \\"Piggies\\"  \\"Rocky Raccoon\\"*  \\"Don't Pass Me By\\"*  \\"I Will\\"*  \\"Birthday\\"  \\"Helter Skelter\\"  \\"Revolution 1\\"  \\"Honey Pie\\"*  \\"Good Night\\"*  What they should've done was have Ringo write or sing more songs, Don't Pass Me By is pure brilliance. Excellent. Also they should've kept George away, except for Piggies.  This is where John starts sucking with [...] like \\"Yer Blues\\" where he pretends to rock, but just sounds like garbage.  Like every album it's up to Paul to pull the weight.
B00005JPLU|4.0|Grecian King (King Leonidas) is fighting for his country, his love and his honor. Surrounded by 300 Spartans, who have been trained from an early age to fight, he heads out to stop the enemy, and uphold tradition. Encountering several other groups who are willing to fight (with not the same skills, but a lot of heart), King Leonidas faces characters that have different agendas and beliefs. There are greedy men, lots of deception, bloody battles, the refusal to surrender, betrayal (by those he trusts, loves and respects), and a \\"gigantic\\" bad guy in a cool costume. As the fate of Leonidas and his 300 Spartians is decided, you will be entertained by the plot, cool costumes and great special effects, which all lead to a decent and entertaining movie.

B00005RYL2|5.0|I must admit that this is one of my favorite movies. I saw this when it first came out and loved it. Just imagine the premise, although some people think it is silly, back in the 80's (when I originally saw it) it was cutting edge, the concept I mean. Connor MacLeod is an immortal, who has lived for centuries, shunned by his village and hunted by some. He has outlived his true love and realizes that his gift (i.e., immortality) is a double edged sword..meaning while he lives forever, those he loves will not. Mentored by Ramirez, played by a dashing Sean Connery, Connor sets forth to simple stay alive and protect his secret. Leap forward to modern day New York an we see MacLeod is wealthy and living life as a recluse. Hunted by those who want his power, attracted to a woman who wants to learn his secret, we learn that other immortals are trying to behead him and receive the \\"quickening\\" (his immortality and power). Destined to live forever, because he can be killed and yet wake up later, with the exception of beheading of course, Connor sets out to protect his interests, his secret and maybe get the girl. What I think I liked more about the original, than the television series (which was made years later) is that Christopher Lambert has a haunted quality about him that simply takes your breath away. As he roams the Scotland countryside, and takes care of his aging wife, who he loves passionately, you realize that he will be alone forever. Although later sequels were not as good, his eyes (which seem to look into your very soul) will always leave a vivid image of someone who is well troubled and yet hopeful. But what is most powerful about this original is the cinematography...Scotland is absolutely beautiful! So rent it or purchase it, you won't be sorry.
0634086782|5.0|This book is one of the very best I have seen, <br />along with \\"hearing the changes\\" by Jerry Coker, <br />and Jazz and Popular Harmony by Daniel Ricigliano, <br />it has become a favorite. <br /> <br />
0143038419|4.0|In Italy, Elizabeth Gilbert is fabulously gluttonous. In India she gets way too pious. In Indonesia, she teeters between the two. When she's narrating her daily activities, she's great. When she's giving background, she's terribly preachy (and sometimes she gets her facts wrong). I didn't find her likable and sometimes I found her really annoying. But when she gets it, it's lay-down-the-book-and-just-meditate-on-it beautiful.
B000002C2E|5.0|\\"Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears.\\"  Herman Melville  \\"Moby Dick\\"<br /><br />We can't know for certain that Dylan took the title of this landmark CD from Melville's classic novel, but we do know that, based on his statements, he has read Melville, along with other classics.  Dylan's sensitivity towards words is matched in the great classic literature.  The phrase, \\"time out of mind\\" means, according to Merriam-Webster's Third International Abridged Dictionary, \\"time immemorial.\\"<br /><br />This recording is one of Dylan's best, if not his very best.  Upon repeated listenings, one hears greater and greater depth, as Dylan, adopting a somber tone, ruminates upon his own  mortality and the sadness of life's disappointments.<br /><br />The songs and production perfectly capture a contemplative Dylan, an Everyman of sorts because he has the genius to give artistic voice to feelings that so many people can relate to.  The opposite of pop art and pop junk, the music on this recording reaches great levels of feeling. Comparing the work on Time Out of Mind to typical popular music is like comparing the psalms of King David to Hallmark Greeting Card sentiment.<br /><br />Time Out of Mind reinforces Dylan's legacy as the minstrel poet of his generation.  Highly recommended and destined to be among Dylan's most enduring works.  In my humble opinion.
B000N6TX1S|4.0|Children of Men dwells on an eerie, chilling and yet engaging proposition. In year 2027, the entire world's infertility has only one hope - one pregnant woman. The intensity of the concept has been superbly developed into a captivating script and coupled with breathtaking cinematography; it becomes a memorable movie that keeps the audience spellbound. Without a doubt, this is a master act.<br /><br />The direction of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n takes the narration along an exciting path and the audience is left charmed by all the twists and turns that are spectacular to witness. The acting is of a high class in general but it is the cinematography that leaves the audience gaping.<br /><br />Another highlight of the movie is a milieu so realistically portrayed that you find yourself in the middle of the events. The events themselves are mesmerizing and you almost feel like reacting to the events that are sometimes eerie and sometimes merely tense but so well portrayed that you can feel them happen.<br /><br />A master act in the art of movie making. Incredibly brilliant.
B000E1155E|4.0|This band is what the Libs would sound like without the slick production - pure, guitar, bass and percussion driven sound. It's a little punk and a little indie - almost a new Buzzcoks. And with only two releases thus far this band looks to be going nowhere but up. This album is their freshman effort and it screams of youthful aggression. The guitar is fresh and vocals aggressive and this is one that is sure to stick in your head for days and make your hands raw from tapping the steering wheel to the beat. Overall a fun and interesting album.

B000022TSW|5.0|If you are a fan of South Park, then you will absolutely LOVE this movie. I continually watch this DVD over and over and the jokes are never old. Was surprised the first time I saw it, to find it was a South Park Musical. The songs are sung and written by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and you will find yourself singing them long after the DVD is out of the player. Buy it, you will have no regrets!
B000002L99|4.0|I remember skipping school to listen to the brand new Van Halen tune fronted by Sammy Hagar, \\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\"  Man was I disappointed.  A year after losing David Lee Roth to a failed attempt at a movie career, Van Halen should have blown their fans minds with something incredible like...well...just about anything on 1984.  Instead, they introduced \\"Van Hagar\\" to the public with a song that sounded like Journey.<br /><br />Once the entire album was released, the future of Van Halen seemed much brighter.  Rockers like \\"Get Up,\\" \\"Best of Both Worlds,\\" \\"Summer Nights\\" and \\"Good Enough\\" proved that Van Halen still wanted to rock.  The title track was, and still is, amazing, one of the best songs in the VH catalog.  \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Love Walks In\\" seemed contrived, strained attempts at expanding on the pop success fueled by \\"Jump.\\"  Lacking the edge or bite of \\"I'll Wait,\\" the synth songs on 5150 suggested the band might be moving away from its bread and butter, guitar-driven rock.  Thankfully, during the rest of Hagar's tenure with the band, poppy keyboard songs were limited to two songs per album.<br /><br />The straight-ahead rock songs still sound good 21 years later; the synth songs sound schmaltzy and dated.  There is enough good -- and some great -- work on 5150 to make it a must-have album.  If you're just getting acquainted with the band, 5150's probably not the best place to start.
B000002H33|5.0|Words cannot describe the sure brilliance these four musicians possessed back in the early days of the underground phenomenon called Thrash Metal. To call Master Of Puppets a Metal classic is to me undermining this treasure. This is one of the greating rock & roll albums of alltime period. It is really unbelievable to think this is the same band that gave us classics like Master, Kill Em All and Ride The Lightning years later went on to give us balless, uninspired crap like Load and St Anger. Well I guess we just have to cherish the good old days when the once Mighty Metallica was all about the music.
1582701709|5.0|I loved it and I can't get enough of it. I have changed my thinking in order to attract all the things that I desire.  I will regard this book as my life bible. <br />Thank you Rhonda Byrne.
0812550757|3.0|I have to say I enjoyed this one much more than -Enders Game-, there didn't seem to be as much filler.  It is strange though because, Card comes up with these really cool sci-fi ideas but then writes his characters so well and fills the situation with such human emotion that the cool ideas get kind of overshadowed. I really like both aspects but for some reason they don't add up and blow me away. So in the end this is the kind of book that I would enjoy on audio but wouldn't really want read in book form (over a period of 4 or 5 weeks - at my speed).<br /><br />The next book is available on audio so I'll probably listen to it sooner or later but I'm not super excited about it.
B0000019PA|5.0|The previous reviewer implies that when Mangum yells out \\"I love you Jesus Christ\\", he is making an ironic joke.  This is not a joke for the listener to be in on, it is one of many challenges presented to the listener (the liner notes and other interviews make this clear).  That Mangum does love Jesus Christ and is willing to put this on the line is a part of this album's genius.  This album is wrought with metaphor, symbolism, surrealist imagery, fear, and compassion.  One thing it does not contain in irony.  Mangum, unlike some of his peers, is beyond this as a lyricist.    The first several times you may hear this album you may want to dismiss it.  Many people dismiss the Diary of Anne Frank as some book you get assigned in [...].  Mangum did not dismiss it as such.  The book made him immensely sad.  He had many questions about the Holocaust and why it had to happen; why Anne had to die?  It was with these questions that he sat down with his guitar to write this album.  I think he got some answers...
B000E41MRC|1.0|There is a dilemma when a repellent ideology underlies a great work of art. It's a profound topic, and there's much to be thought and said about it. But I don't understand why anyone bothers to raise the issue in relation to a gobbler like \\"Triumph of the Will\\".   <br /> <br />\\"The Triumph of the Will\\" is one of the most boring films ever made, endless, monotonous and utterly flat. This is only partly because its content is so tedious. There are speeches from Nazi bigwigs, and some shots of massed callisthenics, but mainly this film celebrates marching. Lots of marching. Then some more marching, followed by some marching, then a bit of a march, followed by more marching. <br /> <br />But the content is not the only problem; the real problem is that Leni Riefenstahl is not a great, or even good, film-maker. An even moderately competent director could probably make some sort of silk purse out of this material. But Riefenstahl made the aesthetic choices that make this such a boring film. She's not thoughtful enough, or sufficiently interested in people, to focus on people or stories, so one potential source of interest is absent. But nor is she artist enough to make something aesthetically interesting, some kind of abstract image, out of her masses of marching morons. Riefenstahl's Nazism seems to have reflected terrible artistic as well as political and moral judgement. She must genuinely have believed that endless footage of marching is inspiring, uplifting and interesting. Which, unfortunately for anyone watching this film, it aint.  <br /> <br />When you inquire about why Riefenstahl is supposed to be a genius, it seems to come down to her supposed innovations in editing and camera work. Now, editing and cinematography are important skills, but the scale of excellence in those fields simply does not go up as far as \\"genius\\". The best film editor and cinematographer who ever lived would be two very skilled craftspeople, but they wouldn't be \\"geniuses\\".  <br /> <br />But even within this limited and technical field she was not an innovator. Busby Berkeley, to give only one example, was doing massed people sequences filmed with innovative camera angles, zooms, pirouettes and whatnot, plus hyper-active editing - Riefenstahl's supposed trademarks - long before Riefenstahl. And Berkeley was not only first, he was better. At least his films - though still tedious, to my eyes - aren't nearly as bum-numbing as this interminable turkey.   <br /> <br />Riefenstahl was an amoral opportunist who participated in the use, and the killing, of slave labour. \\"Triumph of the Will\\" is Nazi propaganda, a film made in the willing service of evil. But that doesn't make it morally complex, nor aesthetically interesting. It bores, it sets records for being boring, and that makes it an aesthetic failure on its own terms. \\"Triumph of the Will\\" is, obviously, a film that celebrates evil, but it is also a turkey of a movie, a tedious, boring, bum-numbing gobbler. This is not the stuff of interesting paradoxes.  <br /> <br />There are two reasons why some people pretend this film is not the crashing bore it really is. One is that, obviously, the world still contains the occasional Nazi moron. The other is the Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome. Around sixty years ago people in film schools decided to claim this film was a masterpiece, apparently because they thought praising a Nazi artwork showed them as interesting people with profound things to say and the ability to look past surface meaning to the pure aesthetic heart of the matter. And so on. Since at time, there has been heavy cultural and rhetorical investment in the idea that this is an important film. And it has been easiest to go along with that.  <br /> <br />But it's neither a good film nor an important film. If you're after the supposed Nazi glamour, I probably don't want to know you, but you'll still be disappointed if you look for it here. And if you want to talk sententious stuff about the nature of evil, there isn't much meat for you in this film either. It's a film about marching, by an over-rated talent, who turned in a deeply dull film. This is malign art, and - for reasons that partly overlap with that fact, but are partly independent of it - it's bad, boring, art. As a film, it's a dog. That's the truth of it. <br /> <br />Fascinating fascism? More like the banality of evil.   <br /> <br />
B000FQJAIW|2.0|I'm a Spanish speaker but I always prefer the original audio of a film. When I tried to watch it with the Spanish subtitles, voila!! I couldn't find them. This edition doesn't have Spanish subtitles despite being announced by Amazon in the DVD features. <br />Having watched it with Spanish audio, I realised the 1977 version's audio is Spanish from Spain but the 2004 version's audio is Spanish from Latin America. <br />When switching menus, ugly flashes with colored squared appear. <br />Summarizing, I won't buy the other episodes.
B000002H5I|5.0|Fearless, forthright, emotional, committed, heartbreaking are all excellent words by others here used to describe this album. And while I like Fast Car which gets a lot of deserved attention. My main reason for reviewing this album is more than its songs but to also note the emotionally gripping tapestry in which they are arrayed. And I'd like to address the really impactful moment on this album; which is up there with the endlessly resonating chord struck at the end of the Beatle's  A Day in the Life. It is Tracy's transition from the heartbreaking acapella in Behind the Walls which drops the listener into a hopeless moment of  sadness followed by reverent silence only to be broken by the gentle guitar and lifting emotion of the words \\"Forgive Me\\" in Baby Can I Hold You. This maybe three to five seconds are one of the great album moments of all time far outstripping the number one hit. This singular moment in music history is the number one reason to experience this classic album. However you will be blessed and charmed with its abundant riches throughout.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Ok, so we have a different Rush album on our hands. Several(too many it seems) of the songs have the tempo of a dirge. The lyrics are (tempo appropriate) melancholy.  There  isn't a melodically consistent song in there - save the last instrumental. The consistency of the song structure seems... pieced together. Moreover, there just isn't a point-on \\"this song rocks\\" on the album. All that being said, as the listens progress the song comes out. It's a meaty album, and you really have a lot to sink your teeth into here. So the tempo then seems right, the lyrics appropriate, and the song forms a familiar structure with the melody surfacing. Then POOF! Before you know it you're rocking, albeit gently. I just wish that would have happened after listen 7 instead of 27. No perfect tune on this one, and not their best album by a long shot. BUT their \\"good\\" albums would be another's Sgt Pepper.   <br /> <br />In summary, patience is a virtue.
B000005L86|5.0|Pardon my being repetitive, but it would be a cardinal sin not to share my opinion. <br />The praise can't be shouted loud enough. Please believe all the hype you have heard about this one! <br /> <br />'Open (your heart) up (to) the gates of Zion', because the genius that is Mr Lee S. Perry is DEFINITELY in full effect here with The Congos, the Upsetters, and his celestial ensemble of back up singers.  <br /> <br />Don't do 'The wrong thing'! Build yourself a 'Solid Foundation'. 'Bring the Mackaback', and revel with brother ants inna 'Noah Sugar Pan'.   <br />If the 'Ark of the Covenant' were music, this CD would definitely be it. <br /> <br />Beg, borrow, steal (or preferably) BUY this Album.  <br /> <br />Redeem your soul, justify your existence, and lose yourself in the musical, visionary and artistic FEAST that is the 'Heart of the Congos'  <br /> <br />The extra disc of mixes/versions is the cherry on top of a pie so sweet that you risk contacting diabetes. <br /> <br />Big up to 'Blood and Fire Limited' for getting this rarity re-released to one & all. <br /> <br />Ras Small Axe

B0002XVQNU|5.0|If you liked the original Daredevil, then the added 30 minute footage in this version will be well worth watching.  It is a great subplot that should not have been left out.
B000063UR2|5.0|The man was a GENIUS and I much prfer the director's cut version.
B000002JSN|3.0|Before I go any further, a fair warning.  I've never been one for (a) collections of outtakes and (b) double albums.  The former tends to consist of the b-grade material that was left off of previous records, the latter has a habit of dredging up material that probably should have been left off the album.  I'd rather have half an hour of quality music than two hours with only a quarter of it worth listening to.  Worst still is the tendency of double albums to dredge up self-indulgent and overlong performances.  In this regard, I'll discuss \\"Physical Grafitti\\", Led Zeppelin's double album, a mix of new recordings and leftovers from previous sessions.  And while it seems ok to pan \\"Coda\\" as a collection of leftovers for some reason, \\"Physical Grafitti\\" gets universally praised.  I'll offer this comment-- there's a fine single record in here, maybe even a fantastic one. <br /> <br />The problem of course is that it does fall into the traps of double albums.  No less than seven of the fifteen tracks come from earlier sessions-- admittedly some of it is decent enough-- \\"Houses of the Holy\\" (from the sessions that produced the album of the same name), a bouncey pop song that was clearly left off the original in deference to other cuts in the same vein, is a catchy piece and a good listen, \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\", recorded for \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" is a decent enough acoustic guitar solo, not essential but hard to think poorly of.  But the rest of the leftovers have their issues-- \\"The Rover\\" has a great muscular riff but finds vocalist Robert Plant a bit on the shrill side, \\"Down By the Seaside\\" seems to come apart at the seams about halfway through.. they just feel like outtakes.  None of them are horrible (ok, well \\"Night Flight\\" is downright awful), but a lot of them aren't fantastic. <br /> <br />Self indulgence and overlong songs also abound nicely-- second disc opener \\"In the Light\\" is the best example of this.  Nearly nine minutes of processed vocals and descending Middle Eastern riffs loses interest about halfway through, likewise \\"In My Time of Dying\\", an eleven minute slide guitar workout, dribbles on and on to seeming no end.  The only time they escape self-indulgence as a negative proves to be \\"Kashmir\\"-- featuring its famed ascending riff, a great, powerful vocal from Plant and a great swirl of strings softening the grind the piece creates naturally.  Even \\"Ten Years Gone\\", a nice motif of quiet guitar passages and churning band performances seems to get old after three minutes or so (and goes on for over six).  There's are a few other tunes that work out ok-- \\"Custard Pie\\" has a great chugging guitar riff and arpeggiated keyboard with Plant downright hoarse and aggressive on his vocal, is energetic, catchy and exciting and \\"The Wanton Song\\" has been a longtime fan favorite for a reason-- it's a great slice of riff-based rock. <br /> <br />Admittedly, I was pretty critical.  In trying to provide a balanced account of this one, I did dig in a bit hard, but I found that double albums almost universally meet with blind praise by folks who are a bit too impressed by its presentation.  A single album \\"Physical Grafitti\\" would have been fantastic.  This record's got way too much fluff on it.
0440237688|5.0|Synopsis <br />The Giver is a captivating story that takes place in the future in a perfect society -no pain, no crime, no unhappiness, no sickness.  Jonas, the main character, is eleven years old at the beginning of the novel.  He is \\"apprehensive\\" for the Ceremony of Twelve.  This is when Jonas will receive his assignment that will be a significant factor for the remainder of his life. Jonas is stunned to find out that he was selected to become the new Receiver.  He is given private training from the Giver, who holds the memories of what past.  These memories include color, cold and snow, war, and family life of the past.  Once the Giver transmits these memories to Jonas, they belong to him.  Overtime, Jonas comes to understand and detest the perfect world he lives in. Together, the Giver and Jonas come up with a plan to change how their community works.  However, before they carry it out, Jonas is forced to make a frightful decision. <br /> <br />Evaluation <br /> <br />The Giver is a thought-provoking book about a fictional futuristic society.  This book is told from a third-person-limited point of view. The fast-pace chapters and clever writing make this remarkable book a page turner.  The characters are three-dimensional and their actions are surprising and at times frightening. Lowry does an excellent job in portraying the themes of \\"balancing the values of freedom and security\\" (Flowers, 1993). In this world of \\"sameness\\" there is no differentiation of human rights and choices of freedom. Everything is controlled from family units, jobs, and emotions.  The cliffhanger ending leaves readers wondering and questioning what really happens to Jonas. After reading this book students ages 9 through 12 will have a greater appreciation of the freedom of choice which they have and the importance of having the opportunity to learn from the knowledge of the past. There is much controversy and criticism of this book and its themes. Some possible concerns are that there are mild sexual references and a scene where Jonas witnesses his father euthanizing a baby by injecting it with a needle in the head.  Although The Giver won the Newbery Medal in 1994 and is used in many middle schools, it does appear on many banned book lists. If you enjoy this book don't miss out on Lowry's Gathering Blue (2000) and Messenger (2004), two other books set in this same futuristic setting. <br /> <br />References <br />Flowers, A. (1993).

B000002J1U|3.0|After a pair of great blues/rock albums, Led Zeppelin decided for their third record that it was time for a change of pace.  Largely leaving behind the blues roots they embraced so heavily, this one recesses the blues tinge and replaces it with a more overt folk sound-- this was certainly present on earlier albums, but here it's the main voice. <br /> <br />Of course, this isn't immediately obvious, the record does open with a fierce, screamed, churning \\"Immigrant Song\\", a two and a half minute slice of heavy metal, but it settles down pretty quickly, and indeed the record's best material is quite tame and dominated by some fine ballads (almost slulggish \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", acoustic \\"Tangerine\\", the absolutely fantastic guitar and mandolin number \\"That's the Way\\").  The exception to this amongst the real greats on the record is traditional \\"Gallows Pole\\"-- soaked in acoustic guitars and mandolins, it picks up a lilt and energy and didn't receive nearly as much attention as it should have until the mid-90s Page/Plant reunion. <br /> <br />Still, unlike their first two records, some pieces on here just don't do it for me-- \\"Friends\\" is a bit too disjoint for its own good and \\"Out on the Tiles\\" is suspiciously filler-like.  It's strengths certainly overtake its weaknesses, but in the Led Zeppelin catalog, \\"III\\" is substantially weaker than the records around it.
B00004RFFI|5.0|This was one of my favoriote movies I saw grown up in my adolescent years. The story is about Jo a young woman living in the late eigties or ealy ninties who is obbsed with tornado after she saw here father sucked up and killed by and f5 tornado when she was about ten years old. Joining here I Hunt her ex husband and his new wife. The three go on adventures with his storm chaser bodies and tornadoes get bigger and the action more intense as it gets futher into the movie. The second half of the movie after the scene at the out door movie theater gets super intense. Can they survive the twisters and be the first people to take measurements inside there funnel with assitance of four weather machines filled with seansr all nicked named Dorthy. This action packed adventure movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and screaming for more. If you like this I also recommend Night of Twister, Volcano, and Earthquake if you can find it. This movie should be fine for 13 and up due to some heavy language and heavy peril scenes for a movie of its time. This movie is worth having regardless of the price. I say about 15 to 30 dollars is a reasonable price to pay for this movie depending on the conditon.
B000002J0B|5.0|Following up something as staggering as their untitled fourth album was no doubt an enormous undertaking, but in the early '70s, Led Zeppelin was on top of the world, and while \\"Houses of the Holy\\" lacks the penetration into the universal collective consciousness that its predecessor had, in its way, it's a stronger record, and it finds the band branching out beyond their previous sounds and influences in reaching in a number of different directions. <br /> <br />And really it's the album's diversity that makes it so successful, the band tackles any number of sounds-- skanking funk guitars (\\"The Crunge\\") sit comfortably alongside gentle acoustics and weeping strings (albeit via a mellotron on \\"The Rain Song\\", perhaps the best ballad the band ever did, with vocalist Robert Plant calm and quiet and yet emotive and self assured).  Along the way, the band turns out a trio of absolutely superb pop songs in the vein of \\"Ramble On\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" in the explosive \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", the funky \\"Dancing Days\\" and the irresistible \\"The Ocean\\", with a reggae-drenched ballad along for the ride (\\"D'yer Mak'er\\").  The album is held together with elements of progressive rock, something the band eschewed on previous records barring \\"Stairway\\" in opening overture \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" and moody, swirling \\"No Quarter\\".  Bottom line, this one never stands still. <br /> <br />Admittedly, I'm rather fond of \\"Houses of the Holy\\", primarily I think because it proves to be one of those timeless albums that hasn't been imitated (or perhaps couldn't quite be imitated).  If you want to start with the FM radio staples, go with \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" (the untitled record), but this one may be a better album.  Highly recommended.
0060545682|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  You will learn a lot about Chile and the author.  Isabel Allende is a very interesting and fun writer.  I was reading this book while commuting and I was often laughing alone in the train.  She has that great sense of humor I some times miss from Southamerica.  Great book.
B000002J03|4.0|If Led Zeppelin's debut album was the blueprint for album oriented rock in the '70s, its followup, \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" was the blueprint for the riff-based rock single and in many ways, for the alternative music of the '80s and '90s.  Sophomore albums are traditionally weak efforts, but Zeppelin avoided that by turning out one of their most well loved albums.  Like their debut, it's steeped heavily in electric blues, but finds the band stretching even further from their roots. <br /> <br />The record consists largely of two kinds of pieces-- blues cuts and soft/loud pop songs.  Of the blues pieces, certainly \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is the most famous-- adapting Willie Dixon's \\"You Need Love\\" into a swirl of psychedelia.  Vocalist Robert Plant is first confident and powerful over the chugging, riff, then frantic and bizarre during the deconstructed bridge, showing an unusual flexibility over the sonic oddity of Jimmy Page.  The band sticks closer to their blues roots on \\"The Lemon Song\\" (not to be confused with the often commonly played \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\" from \\"The BBC Sessions\\"), an amalgam of several blues standards over a dirty riff.  Also notable in the blues form is original \\"Heartbreaker\\" featuring an overdriven bassline and a fierce riff sits in a pretty much standard blues form until one of Jimmy Page's great guitar solos, starting off unaccompanied and then joined by a galloping rhythm section, Page is on fire, fierce and inventive on his wholly improvised solo. <br /> <br />But the real strength of the album lies in its pop songs-- gentle, quiet verses and explosive choruses-- a form that would be utilized by (among others) the Pixies and Nirvana as their trademark style.  \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" starts gently, featuring an assured vocal by Plant before turning into a jangly off kilter chorus.  \\"Thank You\\", a gentle organ-and-acoustic-guitar driven number doesn't quite explode at the chorus so much as pick up a bit of a lilt, is a downright superb ballad, is really the hidden gem on \\"II\\".  But little in the band's catalog can hold a candle to FM staple \\"Ramble On\\"-- churning acoustic guitar, a piercing, upper register bassline and a brilliant, explosive chorus, there's a reason this one gets played endlessly on the radio. <br /> <br />\\"Led Zeppelin II\\" is one of the harder records for me to rate.  I think if I didn't know what was coming from the band, I would've thought a lot higher of it-- it's a fantastic record, there's very little not to love on this one, but the band had even better coming.  If it was another band, it might have gotten five stars from me.
B000000ZGO|5.0|When I was about 12 or 13, my father said the best album he ever owned was Isaac Hayes \\"Hot Buttered Soul\\". I remembered this about 7 years ago and I see why my dad told me that.  Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic is one of the baddest, funkiest track ever made.  If you are a \\"true\\" fan of 70's R&B, this album is a must have in you collection.
B000002J09|5.0|An album that has lent pretty much its entire contents to becoming FM radio staples and seems to figure in pretty much everyone's record collection, \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" (really an untitled record, but this will be an easier reference point) found the band at perhaps their artistic peak, successfully fusing the blues soaked rock of their first two records with the predominant folk influences of the third record.  In addition to just some great music, they managed perhaps the most widely played song in music history in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".    In discussing the record, it's probably best to deal with \\"Stairway\\" first.  Just over 8 minutes, it's pretty much as good as it gets, even if we've all heard it too much to really love it-- gently picked intro fading into 12-string guitars before hitting that explosive solo and powerful, explosive coda.  What's not to love?  It's a pretty impressive cut.    The rest of the record's awfully good too for that matter, covering a surprising amount of ground-- hitting the blues (propolsive \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", call and response opener \\"Black Dog\\"), folk (mandolin-driven \\"The Battle of Evermore\\", with a second vocal by Sandy Denny), infectious pop (\\"Misty Mountain Hop\\"), balladry (the simply lovely \\"Going to California\\") and quite a bit more.  It's an impressive record start to finish and there's not much not to like on here.  It's only fault is that it's been overexposed-- like I said, they're all FM radio staples that we've all heard a million times.    But being overplayed shouldn't effect my rating of the record, and \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" is one of the most successful albums of all time for a reason.  It certainly was a bit part of my high school experience 20 years after it came out, I imagine I'm not the only one with this experience.
0316010669|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell investigates the art and science of intuititive thinking. He does enough to give the reader an insight into all the facets of life that \\"blink\\" influences: society, organization, business; and how those influences can impact the world positively or negatively relative to the desired consequences. However, he fails to explore the questions of how thin-slicing works, how it can be developed, how it can be proliferated, and how it can inter-work with analytical thinking.<br /><br />The author gives in to the temptation of following the formula for making non-fiction books successful in the mainstream: catchy title + idiot-proof tagline + simplicity of message (no more than one concept) + repetitive use of phrases to make the message stick + ... And in the process, the book becomes more of a collection of essays and news reports compiled into a unifying theme of the powerful concept of \\"blink\\". Gladwell's first book [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point]] suffered the same symptom and now Blink. the book has lost its value due to the bastardization and this good book could have been great, had it not. Forgive me for agonizing about what could have been.<br /><br />I was skeptical when picking this book but I should say that the book exceeded my expectations. To Gladwell's credit, this book does not seem to be an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Tipping Point. The author's arguments and opinions are passionate. It's a good read and convinces the reader about the integral role of \\"blink\\" in human decision making, social behavior, opinions & biases, and psychology. A good way to spend your 4 hours.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|The beautiful cinematography of three countries and the tremendous talent of a stellar cast turn out a fine drama of cause-and-effect. If the film has a flaw, it's the length.  \\"Babel\\" takes over two hours to finally reveal the connection between the characters and it got a bit wearing. A grim, gritty drama for a serious viewer, not a date flick.
B0001RVTXO|4.0|I bought this album as my introduction to the Pixies. It's been said that it's a bit of a waste of money compared to Doolittle or Surfer Rosa, because in the end you'll probably buy both of the above albums anyway. That's true to a point - I certainly did buy both, not long after buying this compilation, wasting the early half or so of the CD - but I'm still glad I bought it. <br /> <br />The nice part of this album is that it's set up a bit linearly stylisticly, unlike many \\"greatest hits\\" shufflings of tunes - it starts with a Come On Pilgrim/Surfer Rosa taste, then melds Doolittle into it, eventually moving on to Bossanova and beyond. Because the Pixies albums were distinct to the fine ear, after a few listens, you can get a good sample of what each album is about, and you can even hear the band's growth from from one style to the next. Listening to this CD, for example, I found that I loved the Surfer Rosa and Come On Pilgrim, liked the Doolittle, and didn't care for the rest of it. I bought the CDs according to this and have yet to be let down. <br /> <br />So for any neophyte, I'd recommend it as a first album - find out which parts you like most and hone in on them.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|I bought this set for my girlfriend and somehow ended up getting completely enraptured by the show while watching it with her.  The first season or two are shaky, but soon enough the writers demonstrate an uncanny ability to perfectly blend romance, drama, and plenty of wry humor, as well as using the ordinary as a springboard for analyses about life and social behaviors amongst people via Carrie's musings.  I have truly come to care about many of the characters in this show (although Steve is my personal favorite).<br /><br />However, I'm only giving this set three stars because multiple DVDs in the set are prone to produce pixelation on the screen as well as skipping and freezing.  We weren't even able to play some of the episodes.  At first I thought it was just a defective set, so I purchased another, but this one suffered from the same issues.  Amazon notes that this may occur on older DVD players, but our player was purchased within the last year.<br /><br />I don't know if the same issues arise in the individual sets, but I feel this demonstrates low regard for the series on the part of HBO, and I plan on contacting them about it through their website and suggesting they issue a recall or offer a free replacment program.
B00005JPFH|3.0|I'm not really a Spidey fan or any kind of superhero fan? But I was hoping that in Spider Man 3 would include Spiderman and his Amazing Friends which was a cartoon TV series from the 1980's which included Spiderman best friends Iceman and FireStar.  Iceman who has the ability to freeze anything and everything and FireStar who is a female who can fly and light up fires much like Pyro from XMen but Firestar can fly. I'm not saying they should make a Spiderman 4 because its getting tiresome already. The funny thing is horror movie sequels are always labeled as stupid but I think superhero sequels and action and comedy sequels are the stupidest of all the genre sequels. Horror movies always have a double standard and comedy, action, superhero sequels are never ever labeled as stupid. Hello Star Trek Part 10 or Die Hard Part 4 and James Bond Part 20. Like how many freaking times does Mary Jane need to be saved?
075640407X|5.0|Even after reading the star reviews on the back of the book and all the praise for Rothfuss on Amazon reviews, I had my doubts.  People tend to get a little over-excited about new authors and their debut novels.  Still, I thought I'd give this one a chance.  Good damn thing too!  Don't take it lightly when I tell you that I think Rothfuss will be recognized as one of America's very best fantasy authors in the near future.<br /><br />This is the first part of a three-book series recounting the life of Kvothe, an almost mythical man somewhere between an outlaw and a hero.  As Kvothe-in-hiding narrates the majority of this book, recounting his early days as a child to his coming of age as an advanced student at the University, a new story is also starting to unfold in the present tense.  The overall effect is that you're really reading two separate stories at once, one being the primary story of Kvothe's youth, and the other being much more brief and mysterious but guaranteeing dark futures.  Both stories are extremely infectious and promise excellent tales to come.  You're left with a feeling of only knowing a small part of an epic tale with many secrets and mysteries yet to be discovered.<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated, the characters are incredible.  Kvothe, the main character and storyteller, is somehow at once intimately knowable and mysterious.  One of the strange dynamics of the story is being able to compare the Kvothe of the present to the Kvothe of his story.  Two very different seeming people.  Most of the side characters hold their own secrets as well.  What is the role of the creature of fae who appears to be Kvothe's apprentice or protector or something else?  What is the deal with the frustrating Denna, who presents young Kvothe with so much heartache but appears to be desperately in love with him too?  I can't wait to find out.<br /><br />The overriding theme of this first book is in the form of foreshadowing great events to come.  The reader knows much less than the characters in the book, but gains hint after hint of mysterious secrets to be discovered in the future.  I can't think of another book that takes quite the same approach to telling a tale, but it worked quite well for this one.  Props to Rothfuss for taking the chance on doing something new with his first novel.<br /><br />It is going to be hard waiting two years for the conclusion of the trilogy, but you can bet I won't forget much of this compelling story in the mean time.  After reading Rothfuss' first novel, I'm convinced that he deserves the hype.reader knows much less than the characters in the book, but gains hint after hint of mysterious secrets to be discovered in the future.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|After Pierce Brosnan left the 007 franchise, I felt that no one could fill the part.  I was negative about a new James Bond and not very open minded about a new 007 movie.  I went to see it anyway and found it to be one of the best written and best acted Bond movies ever made.  M is more of a mother type figure and Bond is new and unsure and more human making more mistakes just like a new guy on the job.  I found myself rooting for the guy and believing in Bond at the end.  The 2 disc DVD goes further behind the scenes and is a welcome addition to any movie collection.  I love the packaging and content and highly recomend this DVD.

B000P6PVLC|5.0|I gather from the reviews here that a lot of people don't \\"get\\" Babel.  I'm not surprised -- it's a challenging work of art.   <br /> <br />Babel is not the kind of movie we're used to seeing, and I blame Hollywood for that.  Hollywood doesn't ask or expect much from us, its audience, so the stories it tells tend to be straightforward, action- or plot-driven, and for the most part, formulaic in the ways they meet our expectations.  Babel is not such a movie. <br /> <br />On its face, Babel is a collection of loosely connected vignettes.  There are common threads running through its stories ... the couple fighting for survival in the Moroccan desert, their immigrant housekeeper attending a wedding in Mexico and a depressed, deaf Japanese girl exploring her sexuality.  But what connects the people in these stories is less important than what keeps them disconnected. <br /> <br />Fundamentally, Babel is a movie about language and understanding, or lack thereof.  Misunderstandings arise out of a failure to communicate and these often have life-altering consequences.  Sometimes people fail to understand each other because they speak different languages, or despite the fact they speak the same language. <br /> <br />I saw all five of this year's Oscar nominees in the theater on the same day and left feeling that The Departed would get the award, but that Babel really deserved it.  Having watched both movies a second time since, I still feel that way.

B00005RIKI|5.0|If you are into classic rock, southern rock, or country, you have to like this album.  This particular CD comes with several bonus tracks that are some of (in my opinion) Lynyrd Skynyrd's best work.  You need this album if you don't already have it.  If you have a version of this album without the bonus tracks, this is still worth every penny.
B000002JKA|1.0|This album is horrible. Just horrible. <br />I suppose it depends on what kind of 'Metal' you're looking for.  If you want a return of Queensryche in some form then this album will suit you.  But, if you are out for something really heavy and powerful go find something else.  Like Opeth's Blackwater Park. <br /> <br />Don't buy this album.  It is not a masterpiece like others have stated.  It is a dreadfully bad compilation.

B000002J0B|5.0|Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain, California sunlight, Honolulu starbright, dancing as the summer evenings grow, and the ocean. These are just some of the lyrical images from Led Zeppelin's 1973 album, Houses Of The Holy, that paint pictures of Summer. Musically, the album is lighter and brighter than is usual for Led Zeppelin, too. It also showcases the band's versatility and maturity as songwriters and performers in a variety of musical settings.<br /><br />Right from the beginning, with The Song Remains The Same, it's obvious the band isn't going to follow the tried and true formula of the past. In fact, none of the songs on this album do. All of them are different from any other of Led Zeppelin's songs, and all are different from each other. The Rain Song is a pure classic. With subtle guitar phrases, orchestration, and sentimental lyrics, it's a Led Zeppelin song in a class by itself. Over The Hills And Far Away is a true Led Zep classic that begins as an Irish folk song, then takes off into the rock heavens, with Robert Plant enthusiastically singing and thoughtfully reflecting on \\"how much there is to know\\", while Jimmy Page skillfully rocks out on electric and acoustic guitars. The Crunge is a parody/tribute to the James Brown era of funky soul music with some excellant bass playing from John Paul Jones, and the band pulls it off in good fashion. Dancing Days is a fun song of summer partying with a recognizable guitar riff that sets the pace and tone for the album's seasonal theme. D'yer Mak'er is a reggae/1950's rock hybrid that was an AM radio hit for the band. John Bonham's powerful drums dominate, and give the song it's distinctive personality. No Quarter adds it's form of black light surrealism to the mix, with an animated medievil fantasy and dark, trippy music. Returning to the summer theme, The Ocean closes the album, and it is also a Led Zep classic. Jimmy Page's lively and interesting guitar work is notable on this song, but the spotlight is really on everybody in the group, and The Ocean ends the album on an energetic high note.<br /><br />Houses Of The Holy is Led Zeppelin's most mature and versatile album, full of diverse texture and instrumentation. It's a summer classic for the ages.really on everybody in the group, and The Ocean ends the album on an energetic high note.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|Excellent action, terse dialogue will hopefully launch a new 007.  Mr Craig gives his role a definite grit.  He is beliveable as a ruthless opponent whom gets his heart broken and is seared by that experience. <br />Looking foward to seeing more of him.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I am buying this season the day it comes out. I got my husband addicted to the first two seasons, and I can't wait to show him the third. Then we can watch together when VM gets a fourth season! If you haven't seen this show, you should really check it out: Tuesdays on the CW after Gilmore Girls.
0060557818|5.0|Reading this book is like \\"reading\\" The Matrix except it's a thousand times better.  I highly reccomend this book to everyone.
0793518326|3.0|This is an excellent book that has been made almost unuseable by the ridiculously small print.  Even page numbers require reading glasses.  Whoever authorized this printing obviously never tried to read it.  A shame really.
0385338082|5.0|This is a light, funny read.  If you're looking for deep meaning and substance, you're looking in the wrong place.  If you want an amusing,  unrealistic escape, this is just the ticket.  I enjoyed this book, and have enjoyed all the other Kinsella books as well.  It's a guilty pleasure, like Godiva ice cream, and as a bonus, you often get a few laughs.
B000002B30|5.0|This is an excellent compilation of Springsteen's work up until 1995, including the obvious radio hits plus a number of lesser-known but still very meaningful and at times moving songs.  Nobody sings about the problems and challenges that face ordinary working-class Americans [unexpected pregnancy, unemployment, the hometown drying up, violence comes to the neighborhood] with more feeling than the Boss.  Those songs are well-represented here.  The result is an album that is good music plus good stories.  A winner.
1582701709|3.0|The Secret is a process, at least for me. However, the principles are spiritually rooted. You must be committed, or it won't work for you.
B00005JPD0|3.0|D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu is a big budget action thriller set in post-Katrina New Orleans and stars Denzel Washington (\\"Crimson Tide\\"), Val Kilmer (\\"Top Secret\\"), and Jim Caveizel (\\"Passion of the Christ\\").<br /><br />The film, directed by the stylish Tony Scott, opens with tons of marines boarding a ferry to go to a party. We see smiling kids, happy families and all sorts of other joyful scenes.  Then the ferry explodes and over 500 people die.  Agent Doug Carlin (Washington) of the ATF arrives on the scene, clues are gathered and details of the crime are slowly put together.  Meanwhile, Carlin finds a dead body, a woman, who appears to have been a victim of the ferry disaster, but actually died a few hours before.  An FBI team led by Val Kilmer decides to let Carlin in on a secret.  They have special project that allows them to see what happened exactly four days in the past. They can't alter the past, but if what they want to see is within range, they can watch anything.<br /><br />The middle part of the movie involves Carlin watching the dead girl, Claire Kuchever, go about her life as she approaches her impending death. This new technology allows them to identify the killer and ultimately apprehend him. The big question is, Carlin wonders, can this technology allow him to go back in time and prevent the murder of the beautiful Claire, and also prevent the Ferry bombing.<br /><br />As with most time-travel viewers, the plot will often force more questions than it will give answers. This movie is interesting, the acting is good, but it also has a few problems. The time-travel questions aren't aswered clearly. Caveizel's character is wasted, and the ending seems out of place. Still, if you're a fan of the actors in this film, I recommend it, just don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|This is one of the worst mastering jobs I've ever heard (and lately I've been hearing a lot of really bad ones).  Whoever did this (or forced the engineers to do this) does not deserve to be involved in the music industry and owes a huge apology to all the fans.  It's really sad to think that so many music fans are being deprived of hearing the music they like with the sound as it emerged from the instruments, rather than some stupid digital compression machine that belongs in a radio station, not a recording studio. <br /> <br />Try to find the vinyl version of this album and listen to it side-by-side with the awful CD version.  It will really open your ears as to what this music is supposed to sound like.
B000HA4WTS|5.0|I love this movie, the graphics are pretty good in HD. I highly recommend this movie to everyone that has a HD player!
B00006EXL5|5.0|Wasn't sure when I first bought it, but now absolutely love it. The riffs, the lyrics everything we have come to know and love from MCR. This is an album I would highly recommend.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|After repeated listenings, I've finally figured out what's been bothering me about this new release.  Others have asked \\"where's the magic?\\", or stated \\"they've lost it\\".  One word. Lyrics. <br />Frankly, I'm concerned about Neil.  His personal tragedies of nearly a decade ago are apparently still very much on his mind.  Time, and a new marriage haven't seemed to help brighten his outlook on life.  He seems to have a dim, dark view on just about everything, and it comes across in spades in his lyrics.  And that's a shame, really.  The music and instrumental work on this album is some of the best they've done in years.  The downbeat lyrics bring everything to a nearly depressing level.   <br />I've suffered personal tragedies, as we all have.  I lost my mother nearly five years ago after a long illness, and believe me, it was tough. Not a day goes by that I don't remember her.  But, it's been said \\"time heals all wounds\\".  And it does.  We deal with it, and move forward. <br />Neil's lyrics of the past described life and our surroundings in a positive, curious, upbeat way. And this is what's been missing.  His ability to say so much with a few words was truly remarkable. <br />I really don't think anyone wants to hear another 2112 or Moving Pictures.  What I think we long for with Rush, is the same interesting, unique, enlightning lyrics we've come to expect and enjoy, not the dim, dark, hopeless words that we hear now. <br />I'll give Snakes and Arrows 4 stars for the music, and 3 stars for the lyrics.  <br />Mr. Peart, let the healing begin.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000M341QE|4.0|Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg were great.  However, the movie definitely did not end as expected.  Worth the price of pay-per-view.
B000MGUZM0|2.0|I had big expectations for this album and it let me down. I would say after about 5 listens that there is one hit on the album. That being song number 4 - \\"Intervention\\". The songs just dont blow me away like the previous album. Also many religious refrences. I was dissapointed with this album......
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Some would say I live under a rock because I had never heard of Corine Bailey Rae until she appeared as a musical guest on The Tonight Show.  When I heard her smooth, smokey voice and saw how well she plays guitar (threw in some nice jazz chords), I immediately ordered this CD and absolutely love it. <br /> <br />If the typical Top 40 garbage is your cup of tea, you will not appreciate the awesome composition and recording style of this production. It definitely appeals to musicians, as evidenced by my jazz guitarist crony who was blown away by this.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|After waiting for so long for a new CD, this one let me down. I give it a three just because it is Avril, she is talented and I know that, like she says in one song, she \\"can do better\\". The music's great, but the lyrics are not. Adding cuss words only makes it worse, since it proves poor imagination in the lyric-writing process; cuss words have an infinite number of rhymes. I don't mind silly songs here and there (Gwen Stefani does it effectively), but 80% of the CD with them...bleh! Might be ok for other artists because that is what you expect from them, but not from Avril. Don't get me wrong, it's great to have some silly fun now and then, but this is not Avril's best. Still, some songs are good, like \\"Keep Holding On\\". Next album she releases I will have to think twice before buying.
B000002JPA|5.0|I have recently discover Dream Theatre, a band that I knew but never took the time to listen to their albums.  Now I did and I have discover one of the best band that I have ever known, they are so talented! <br />The music is complex, played with perfection by incredible musicians! <br />The more I listen to them, the more I like, think I'll turn into a fan soon ! This album is amazingly good.  A perfect score !
1851774394|5.0|Don't bother ordering this through Amazon - They're out of stock and haven't been able to get more copies since February. My order keeps being delayed the day that it lists that it's supposed to ship. It's more expensive elsewhere, but at least you've got the option of actually getting it. I broke down and paid double the price listed by Amazon just so that I could stop waiting for it to arrive each month. <br /> <br />I've heard this is a fantastic reference. Now if only I could get a copy!
B000E41MRC|5.0|It is far from easy to review such material! I only wish the star grading were optional. Several people here have already noted the talent of the film-maker and how she conceptualized on film, and revolutionized, what has come to pass as propaganda.<br /><br />I was interested more in the documentary side of this film--I wanted to have a glimpse at the Sixth Congress of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, which took place in Nuremberg between September 4 and 10, 1934. For the astute scholar of the totalitarian regimes, this is an interesting and revelatory work. Here are some quickly drawn observations:<br /><br />Hitler does not quite have all the power in the state, he speaks as if he has 90% of it and ALL his acolytes speak of him as if he is God-sent;<br /><br />Hitler speech sounds cryptic/messianic and even banal at times (not only in comparison to the highly rhetorical Gobbles);<br /><br />Hitler starts with good voice but soon turns to screeches;<br /><br />Hitler's language about the mission of the German people is still about peace, not belligerent, yet mobilizing;<br /><br />Hitler seems to want to make, and achieve, a deeper contact with the individual when he greets the troops;<br /><br />Hitler has extremely well studied gestures;<br /><br />The SA vs. SS power struggle is still going on with Hitler lying about how much he owes and likes the former;<br /><br />The SA folks (and leader) look noticeably less than the SS;<br /><br />There are visible security forces planted between the enthusiastic attendees and Hitler;<br /><br />The classless society is exulted;<br /><br />Relentless indoctrination of the populace starting with the thousands of German youth in attendance;<br /><br />Future troops march uniformed, holding just shovels--according to the Versailles Treaty, Germany is allowed little re-militarization;<br /><br />Very few shows of the mechanization in the German armed-forces--history tells us that it was taking place at full capacity;<br /><br />The enthusiasm of the thousands of people involved seems genuine, it is quite difficult to detect the rigidity present in similar gatherings in former communist countries or in China. The bystanders do not seem equally enthusiastic, but show genuine interest (and probably hope?);<br /><br />Great sense for how to dominate the populace through symbols, mystic, and ritual;<br /><br />Hard to come up with any indication about how educated/intelligent Hitler is--there are some book reviewers here claiming just this. It is more obvious he is surrounded by some very smart people;<br /><br />The members of the German government come all to praise Hitler. With few exceptions, they give up all dignity in the process, yet Hitler manages to keep his composure;<br /><br />The heads of the German justice praise Hitler's total power over the (justice) system--scary moment indeed.<br /><br />So, for the student of totalitarian systems, this is a good document that shows some of the elements present in early totalitarian systems. Deceit to the largest extent, populace falling for pomp and lies, elites bending to extremes for power (to please and get a piece of it), most checks and balances (internal and external) either play along or are crushed, and a certain type of individual at a certain time and in a certain place. The rest is history, which if not learned from will repeat itself...the thousands of people involved seems genuine, it is quite difficult to detect the rigidity present in similar gatherings in former communist countries or in China.

B000089CPF|1.0|I'd heard of Calexico, but had never purchased an album.  Then I saw them play at the Republic in New Orleans the night before they were to play the annual Jazz Fest.  They BLEW MY MIND as a live band. <br />Seriously one of the best shows I have ever seen.  Then they did it again the next day on a huge stage at Jazz Fest!!!!  The crowd was very into it. <br />So after debating (with myself) which of their discs to purchase, I chose \\"Feast of Wire\\".... <br />My companion and I were hoping to sort-of recreate their live shows with a cd for our road trip out of New Orleans, but were sorely disappointed.  <br />This cd is boring overall and does not capture their live energy, which is their greatest asset.  Also, there's too much synth-sounding \\"things\\" on this album....I was hoping for a more organic sound --- more like their live sound.  Apparently all albums before this one are more what I was looking for!!
0307346609|5.0|Although I was very entertained by Brooks' first book, The Zombie Survival Guide, this second novel was much better. This isn't to say that The Zombie Survival Guide was bad. It was quite good, in its own tongue-in-cheek way, but World War Z even better. I think this partially stems from the fact that, although The Zombie Survival Guide said that this was all serious, it wasn't very convincing at being serious. The whole scenario was very well though out, but it might as well have had a sign on the front saying This is all in jest, and unfortunately this detracted from the quality of the story.  Another factor was that I, being a fan of zombie flicks and books, felt that I was sort of being made fun of. (I don't know if this is a natural, in-born, defensive, irrational reaction, or that it really was meant to be insulting; I think the former is more likely). I digress; back to the novel currently being reviewed. The novel starts in China, around 2010 or so (its never really clear) with a rural doctor being called to treat a young boy with apparent sudden on-set phycosis. It soon becomes obvious that the boy is dead and is in fact a zombie. The book then goes into detail abou the quick and total collapse  of society in the face of the walking dead. Eventuaally the U.S. and others go on the offensive against the zombies and kill most of the large \\"swarms\\", but the bootom of the ocean ( the zombies walk about eternally on the ocean floor in this book because they aren't affected by pressure and their flesh is extremely toxic) and the more northerly longitudes (because zombies can be frozen solid in sub-zero temperatures and un-thaw later, still able to function and extremely dangerous) are still heavily infected. There are overall no flaws to World War Z. For those of you who enjoy zombie fiction this is an absolute must-have. Most casual readers of zombie fiction (which I technically am) will still enjoy World War Z. But anybody who has a general aversion for zombie books or people sqeemish about this subject matter (i.e. death, destruction, and canablism, both zombie and human) will want to aviod it.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|A bit darker than we have come to expect from Bond over the years, but a very satisfying thriller. Much like the recent Batman Begins, this film takes a tired franchise and re-starts it, portraying the very first mission of its hero. Daniel Craig is surprisingly good, and better than most, as Bond and Judy Dench is (as always) wonderful as M. <br /> <br />And Bond fans will love the last line of the film. <br /> <br />Can't wait for the next one.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|After the disappointment I found listening to \\"Vapor Trails\\", I wasn't sure what to expect with their first \\"new\\" release in 5 years.  This album is NOT \\"Vapor Trails\\" -- it is terrific.  I have been listening to Rush since their inception, and every album seems to \\"mature\\" with the band themselves.  It takes a very \\"special\\" ear to appreciate what Rush does, and for those \\"reviewers\\" here who want to compare \\"old Rush\\" (2112, Moving Pictures, Hemispheres, etc) to \\"new Rush\\" (Roll the Bones, Test for Echo, Counterparts) are completely wrong in their assessment.  I read one review that stated that there's not one song which is \\"melodically consistent\\" -- WHAT??  That's Rush, man!  If you want \\"melodically consistent\\" songs, go listen to \\"top 40 pop\\".  That's what makes Rush -- you never know what's coming next in their music!  <br />Another review said that Neil Peart has lost his lyrical imagination -- NOT!  His lyrics are always thoughtful, insightful, imaginative, and sort of \\"off-the-wall\\".   <br />Another lame review says that it's \\"lame, mediocre music\\" and there's no \\"goose bump factor\\" -- man, all I have to say to you is open your ears and your mind and LISTEN TO IT!   <br />This, by far, is the best album these guys have done since \\"Test for Echo\\" and \\"Counterparts\\"!! <br />To the nay-sayers -- true fans, you are NOT!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|The best James Bond movie in a long while. Reminds me of the older Sean Connery movies minimizing the high-tech and maximizing the action. The chase-scene on foot at the beginning of the movie is amazing and sets up the rest of the movie.
B000O178BY|3.0|NIN is my all-time favorite, but I wish that Trent had taken a bit longer to mature this album.  While the concept is fine (although certainly not original) and timely(!), the development of the lyrics and music leaves one (at least this one) unsatisfied.  I WANT this to be a great album; I love Trent's usually fabulous lyrics and interesting sounds, but this album just doesn't deliver.  Every album thus far (perhaps with the exception of With Teeth, which was hit and miss) has resonated with my development, feelings/passions, and ideas, and this album tries to get there, but makes me feel that I have regressed about 15 years to expressing myself in simplistic teen-talk.  It most likely will appeal greatly to angry teenagers (or adults) who possess little perspective: a great album if you are a mass-market type fan who wants to be something else; an okay album and certainly worth buying if you're a die-hard Reznor fan.  I own it and will keep supporting Trent, but I really miss the lyrical and musical sophistication of Pretty Hate Machine, Downward Spiral, and The Fragile...
B000002J1C|4.0|By 1970, my own personal preference in \\"art rock\\" was pretty well established, and it was not British prog-rock (or classical rock) for the most part.  My own personal preferences were leaner, meaner and quintessentially American: the Velvets, the Stooges, and a few of the proto-punk bands they were already beginning to inspire.  I also had a thing for the core S.F. bands (the Airplane and the Dead primarily).  But I was never closed-off to anything, in theory, and not nearly as territorial about music as some of my friends were at the time.     To me, it was all good, potentially at least.  I was just hippie enough to be open to anything. Whatever anyone brought to the table just might prove to be a tasty dish.  The real reason I didn't pick up too much on Yes, the Moodies, Genesis or any of those guys was largely economic.  I just couldn't afford to get everything.  But if someone was classically trained and wanted to incorporate that in to their brand of rock, well, more power to 'em.  If someone wanted to go back to basics, well, that was their prerogative too.    I certainly heard Yes on the radio and at friends' houses.  I think I meant to purchase some of their stuff--eventually.  But I never quite got around to it.  Musically, they sounded pretty accomplished.  Jon Anderson's high pitched vocals, while technically impressive, did not really do much for me, however.  I would later feel the same way about Styx, Supertramp and Rush, for that matter.  It wasn't necessarily drive me away, but I tend to be less enamored of groups' whose singers sound like they've been sucking on helium balloons.    In fairness, however, part of that effect was due to the tinny radios I was hearing much of the stuff on.  Listening to this record on a moderately good system, some 36 years after its release, it sounds pretty good.  Vocally, the harmonies work well, even when the lead singer sounds a bit pinched.  On the instrumental end, they are always interesting, with Chris Squires' bass and Steve Howe's guitar work impressive throughout.      Because I had only given the band only a cursory listen back in the day, I didn't realize that this, their third album, contained about half of the group's staples currently played on classic rock stations today.  Of course, few artists' works are well represented by that format, and perhaps I shouldn't assume from that fact that the group peaked early.  But it is at least interesting that for many people Yes means pretty much \\"Your Move/All Good People,\\" \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" (the latter of which prompts the musical question, \\"My WHAT is no disgrace\\") and one or two others.  Sort of a shame, really, the other tracks are interesting enough. But what are you going to do in the current corporate radio environment.  Get an iPod, I guess.    As I say my history with the group is spotty at best.  I'm not even sure how I came to own this CD.  It may have been given to me by someone who bought the later, remastered version.  And that IS the singlemost irritating problem with this 1993 CD release.  It's waaay to muddy.  It's just good enough that you're curious to hear it remastered.  I'll have to add it to my list of future purchases to consider.  Hopefully, it won't take another 36 years to get around to.
1582701709|4.0|The ideas in \\"The Secret\\" are not new, but they are presented in a readable language that obviously appeals to a wide range of readers.  However, some people may become discouraged - or even feel guilty - when they don't achieve the claimed results, simply because their expectations are unrealistic.  Reviewers who happily say \\"I can have anything I want\\" are in for a let-down. Mind power is not like using Aladdin's lamp, producing anything you wish for.     In study after study, human intention has been proved to be a real force, but over-simplifiying it can have significant dangers, the greatest being that of taking the concept too far - as if it is magic, rather than a progressive change in one's thinking. Like any new skill, learning to deliberately focus your intention takes time - and effort.      I would also question the claim that our thinking is the only thing that creates our reality.  There are other factors that influence our outcomes.  For example, to say that our thoughts invariably create our illnesses is to ignore two basic facts: firstly that we have to TAKE ACTION to bring about the change we want: we have to stop smoking, change our diet, or even take medication.  Then there are the toxic environments we have to avoid (thinking environments as well as chemical.) And as far as the claim that it is only our thinking that makes us fat, this is an absurdity.  Here again there can be medical reasons (such as low thyroid) for being overweight. Or we can even be eating the wrong food - you can't simply think yourself thin on a junk diet of 4000 calories.     Other people can also affect our outcomes - for example studies have shown that even the doctors treating us can affect the outcome of our illness by their negative or positive expectations - even unspoken.       This book can certainly open up new possibilities for those who have believed they had no control over their destiny.  But if you want to get past the initial buzz of this book and achieve some long term results, please don't stop there. Some of the claims need to be seriously checked out. Further reading is vital.  Other reviewers have recommended some excellent books.  I would add Michael Talbot's \\"The Holographic Universe\\" (1991) or Bruce Lipton's \\"The Biology of Belief\\" (2005.) While they may not be quite as easy to read, the authors are far more careful about the truth of what they claim.  Lynne McTaggart's \\"The Intention Experiment\\" (2007)is of the same high standard.      The real test of a motivational book like this is in our doing: beyond the initial warm fuzzies, what will we be actually achieving in twelve months months time?
B0000C9JCM|5.0|I was in an art gallery when I heard this playing in the background, I asked the sales associate what this was and she told me. I especially love number 4 \\"Cannon of the three Stars\\" by \\"The Plasma Symphony Orchestra\\". The new age sound was very lovely. You will love this album.
076790382X|5.0|If you enjoy reading books by Bill Bryson, this is a very funny book. Easy to read and entertaining.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I am a pretty big fan of the book and have seen various versions of it in movies. I was not particularly fond of any until I saw this one. It is, by far, the best adaptation of the novel. The only thing I felt did not ring true to the book was that both Jane and Mr Rochester were rather attractive. But I don't think that's really a bad thing. :) <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any fan of the novel.
B000055ZDT|5.0|If you dig heavy music, this is a must have for your collection. This is low end doom heavy, like Sabbath on acid x 10. This is a really, really great listen, super psychadelic and trippy, crazy, creepy, heavy doom riffs from some planet light years away where the creatures evolved from shroom spores and spiked leather collars.  <br /> <br />And to top it off, this cacophony of doomcore is a power trio of burnouts from England.  <br /> <br />Top notch, if you dig the heavy, cop this album immediately if not sooner. <br />
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I fell in love with this CD at first listen! I'm sure you will, too!<br /><br />To make an impact on the ears of fine music aficionados, a singer has to have a great vocal style, an enormous talent and an innate passion. Michael Bubl&eacute;, without a doubt, possesses all these qualities. It's so impossible not to love and truly be impressed with the beauty of this latest offering from Mr. Bubl&eacute;, another one of his heartwarming and remarkable recordings.<br /><br />I first heard Michael Bubl&eacute; in 2003 over a radio station in L.A. singing \\"Moondance,\\" and that song turned me on to his gorgeous music and I was totally beguiled by his smooth voice, his great singing style, and of course his tasteful choice of material on all his recordings. And the rest is history. To date, I have most of his notable CDs added to my collection. I especially love the CD he recorded exclusively for Hallmark for its Valentine's Day offering, [[ASIN:B000ERIENE with love, Michael Buble]], and of course his self-titled CD [[ASIN:B000088E6D Michael Bubl&eacute;]], [[ASIN:B00070Q7VO It's Time]], and the Dual Disc/DVD [[ASIN:B0001IN07Q Come Fly With Me (CD & DVD)]].<br /><br />In this CD, the singer from Canada has illuminated the timeless songs of Johnny Mercer, Sammy Cahn, Henry Mancini, Jimmy Van Heusen, Harold Arlen, Ted Koehler, Cy Coleman, Eric Clapton, among others. He made each song breathe a new lease on life and gave each one a wonderful twist starting off with a sparkling version of John Clayton-arranged-track, \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" down to dazzling \\"Dream.\\" I've never heard this Johnny Mercer  classic interpreted in a most beautiful way until now. The charming arrangement was done by one of the greatest Sinatra arrangers of all-time, Johnny Mandel. The first time I heard it, I got goose bumps and chills up my spine! It reminds me so much of a legendary icon of a singer when he was younger. Many thanks to Johnny Mandel's brilliance and creativity in arranging superb and enchanting charts, and Michael Bubl&eacute;'s flawless rendition as well as the excellent instrumentation of the finest studio musicians for making this song so special and hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />My favorites include Johnny Mercer's \\"Dream\\" and Eric Clapton's \\"Wonderful Tonight,\\" which is a duet with Ivan Lins, a Brazilian singer/composer and well-known for his remarkable compositions such as \\"Love Dance\\" and \\"Velas.\\" Listen closely to its enthralling Bossa Nova arrangement by David Foster and Jorge Calandrelli (strings) and the mesmerizing guitar solo by Hector Pereira. The inclusion of its Portuguese lyrics adds an enchanting glow to this song. The Latin-infused version of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" (\\"Meglio Stasera\\") is a joy to listen to. I'm also delighted with the title track, Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen's \\"Call Me Irresponsible,\\" one of the best tracks and one of my absolute favorite songs of all-time. Ditto with his swinging version of \\"I've Got The World On A String.\\" I love its additional background vocals . . . \\"Hey Michael, come on and swing, looks like you've got the world on a string.\\"<br /><br />Two original songs, \\"Lost\\" and \\"Everything\\" showcase the singer's talent as a songwriter. He co-wrote \\"Lost\\" with another promising Canadian singer Jann Arden, and pianist Alan Chang. I love \\"Everything\\" for its heartfelt lyrics and music with a nice contemporary flair - it's now one of my favorite new songs.<br /><br />\\"You're my carousel<br />You're my wishing well<br />And you light me up when you ring my bell<br />You're a mystery<br />You're from outerspace<br />You're every minute of my every day\\"<br /><br />My congratulations to Michael Bubl&eacute;, David Foster, Humberto Gatica, Johnny Mandel, Jorge Calandrelli, Don Sebesky, Bob Rock, John Clayton and all the musicians involved with this wonderful recording. I'm looking forward to your next project.<br /><br />Absolutely, totally and most definitelyrecommended for your listening enjoyment.<br /><br />P.S. I'd like to sincerely thank a friend of mine who has a generous heart for sending me this CD (and a couple more) after reading my reviews and my Wish List and who really likes the same kind of music I so love. I appreciate your kind gesture and your praises on my reviews!<br /><br />P.P.S. I can't wait to be at Michael's concert in L.A. this summer. I hope \\"Dream\\" will be on the repertoire.heart for sending me this CD (and a couple more) after reading my reviews and my Wish List and who really likes the same kind of music I so love.

B00005JPFF|5.0|Spider-Man was GREAT, Spider-Man II was even BETTER, and now Spider-Man III is the CHERRY ON THE CAKE!  <br />This time the stakes are raised high with Spidey pitted against Sandman, Venom, New Goblin and possibly his most dangerous rival to date... himself! <br />Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again!  <br />The plot, the dialogues, the setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful!  <br />In short, keep them coming!!! <br />
B0000214F0|5.0|The movie is great classic. It tells the story of a Roman Emperor Caligula worts and all. Set in the time of decadent Rome, it tells the story of ones rise to power and how it became his downfall. How human life had little value. The nude action was great as it seemed to be natural as it would in its time. The dry humour and wit is refreshing to hear and a lot of \\"comedies\\" today can learn from this movie as well as the modern day pornos. The soundtrack was great, classical music has always been the most sensual type to make love to. Enjoyed it alot.
B000FBHC7S|5.0|If you dig heavy music, this is a must have for your collection. This is low end doom heavy, like Sabbath on acid x 10. This is a really, really great listen, super psychadelic and trippy, crazy, creepy, heavy doom riffs from some planet light years away were the creatures evolved from shroom spores and spiked leather collars.    And to top it off, this cacophony of doomcore is a power trio of burnouts from England.    Top notch, if you dig the heavy, cop this album immediately if not sooner.    Also, import seems to have an extra track at the end, bonus!
1400062756|4.0|This is an interesting book that will certainly open your eyes to your own attitudes and habits about success, praise and criticism. If you are interested in this book from the perspective of how to improve your parenting though, please take a look at \\"Between Parent and Child\\" by Dr. Haim Ginott. The author actually quotes Dr. Ginott in several places. This book was written in 1965 and it reveals the same counter-intuitive but highly effective advice on how to better communicate with, praise and motivate our children (e.g. \\"Children need to be free from the pressure of evaluative praise so that others do not become their source of approval\\", \\"It is not unusual for children who are praised for being smart, to become less likely to take on challenging learning tasks\\"). It also provides much more comprehensive, readable and coherent advice on parenting strategies in general. Just by accident I happened to purchase these two books at the same time and I was struck by the similarity between the ideas in both books. If the desire for parenting strategies drew you to the Mindset book, do yourself a favor and check out Dr. Ginott's book.
B000O75F7C|3.0|It's taken me a few runs through to warm up to this one, mostly because what I hear is something like left-overs from Deadwing, and approximations of territory covered by Tool. Neither of these are bad things, but this simply hasn't jumped up and grabbed me like Deadwing, In Absentia, Warsaw Live or Arriving Somewhere Live. Perhaps what I sense is a growing dislike for lyrics evincing a state of arrested emotional development in Wilson. It could all be fictional, of course, but he might have some unresolved issues tied in with an unabating narcissism. It makes for songs that whine a lot.  <br />Much is made of the 17 minute track, and truth is, it's actually two songs, both of which could have used better editing. When you self-produce, you can lose the perspective of another angular vision, and to me, I would have preferred a shorter take on the first two-thirds and perhaps would have sent Wilson to the shed to come up with one more tune, even a recapitulation of anything from Blackfield II, an altogether more satisfying effort than this. The final track, \\"Let's Sleep Together\\" is the most odious lyric and unpleasant melody I've heard since King Crimson's \\"Ladies of The Road,\\" an insufferably mysogynist track from the maligned Earthbound line up. <br />There is a odd mix to the CD as well - it sounds more like Gavin Harrison with a backing band, and that is a turn in production I hadn't noticed in other PT cds. As a result, the cd as a whole sounds more like Tool than PT. Not a bad thing, but I happen to like each of the bands for their own ersonality. I have often thought that PT is the band Pynchon had in mind 40 years ago in The Crying of Lot 49. Also a band with a lyrical sense of arrested development. I'm going to the concert in a few weeks, it will be interesting to see where the music goes in a live setting.
B000M5AJQS|1.0|Not unlike most of the characters in this film, i should be SHOT IN THE HEAD for seeing another picture based on oscar nepotisms.JACK plays the revered head of an IRISH gang in boston , yet HIS name is COSTELLO. To further muddy the waters he is either at war or  at least at odds with RIVAL ITALIAN mobsters,yet he travelS ABOUT TOWN WITHOUT EVEN A BODYGUARD! I can't tell you more without spoiling the plot but if i did  you would realize how NON CREDIBLE this story is and save 2 hrs of moaning and growning. Good luck finding a hero - there are none!.. which is why everyone in this story gets shot in the head. MALES IN THE TARGET AGE GROUP 15- 25 WILL LOVE THE VIOLENCE AND  PROFANITY WHICH WARRANTS CAPS HERE BECAUSE THE 'F' WORD IS IN PRACTICALLY EVERY OTHER SENTENCE. JACKS' performance is uneven and at times over the top, but then again, that's JACK. Better acting  nods go to matt and leo  with matt getting an a + in mastering the bostonian accent. Sometimes an OSCAR is given based on a life's work instead of a specific film-think JOHN WAYNE FOR \\"TRUE GRIT\\" WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE GOT IT FOR \\"THE SEARCHERS\\"  OR A FEW OTHERS.I learned MY LESSON...HOPE YOUR'E ABLE TO LEARN ONE HERE TOO
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Have been a bond fan all my life.  Am ashamed to admit that I was one of those naysayers who felt Daniel Craig was wrong for the role.  Begging the gods for forgiveness for my transgression.  In my opinion, this was the best Bond movie to date and Daniel Craig is the perfect embodiment of the character!  I thoroughly look forward to the future of this series with Mr. Craig at the helm! <br /> <br />Did I say awesome?
B00005S6K6|5.0|Even after all these years, this remains one of my favorite love stories. It is a different kind of love story though..the two main protagonists played by Robert de Niro and Meryl Streep are married to other people, yet a chance encounter leads to another meeting, and eventually a friendship develops...this later moves on to something more deep, an attraction and love that transcends everything else. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore...there is no gratutious sex or foul language, just a slow simmering attraction that grows from strength to strength. The two leads are good people who don't really want to hurt their respective spouses, and so their moral dilemma...how do they realise their true feelings for each other whilst not hurting their spouses? Adultery is such a delicate subject, yet is handled here with gentleness and finesse. De Niro & Streep give exacting performances, with tremendous depth and insight into the psyche of a pair of 'lovers' who desire to be with each other yet also want to remain faithful to their marriage vows. A classic love story & definitely a keeper!
B000O174CM|3.0|I purchased the soundtrack before seeing the film.  I was not impressed and have not listened to it again.  I thought the music sounded like it was the product of someone that had no idea what the real Motown sound was all about.  It is way over-orchestrated but I know this is Broadway - it's supposed to be.<br /><br />I thought that after seeing the film and the songs in thier proper context maybe I would like them a little better.  Nope, music's still too \\"White\\", but I did really enjoy the actors.  Eddie Murphy got robbed on the Oscar, Jennifer Hudson was good and probably deserved hers, but I can't really say because I did not see any of the other nominated performances.  So...I give the film 4 stars and the music 2 stars.<br /><br />Lots of extras on disc 2 make this 2-disc set worth the extra money.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Its been one week since the official release of \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" (in the US). Having been listening to this album on a daily basis ever since, the album has been unraveling itself, allowing itself to sink in on me (though I can assure, the album won't be completely \\"sunk in\\" for a while).  <br /> <br />After the opening chords of the opener, \\"Far Cry\\", the blood starts flowing. Older listeners probably have nostalgia as it feels like it could have been taken right out of the \\"Hemispheres\\" album. However, the song (the album), quickly turns into the more modernized Rush that we have come to expect. <br /> <br />Like recent Rush releases, \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is a very textured, layered album that takes time to unravel itself. The album is also quite long, having thirteen tracks altogether. My initial reaction, and I still hold to this view, is that this album could have definitely trimmed some of the fat (in terms of layering) and also cut out some of the weaker songs, which in my opinion are \\"Bravest Face\\" and \\"Good News First\\".  <br /> <br />However, this album has some very strong material in it. Some of the highlights include the opener \\"Far Cry\\", the A-grade instrumental piece \\"The Main Monkey Business\\", and \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" and \\"Faithless\\", both of which are proggy tracks with interesting arrangements. The rest of the album is very solid as well. There really isn't a bad track that's a pain to the ear, but again, the album could have definitely tossed out two of the weaker tracks without compromising its merit. <br /> <br />To conclude, \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is a very strong effort proving that Rush still have some gas left in the tank. It's no \\"Permanent Waves\\" or \\"Hemispheres\\", but it's a good album nontheless. Definetaly one of the best albums so far this year. \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is an impressive offering, espeically considering that these guys have been releasing albums for well over thirty years.
0385751060|5.0|I do not know why people are saying Bruno's outlook on life is so unrealistic. We, as teenagers and adults, sometimes have trouble facing the horrible things going on in the world and children going through family problems or health issues sometimes put a protective \\"shield\\" around them, turning a blind eye to what is happening for no reason other than to protect themselves from (and I know this isn't a word, but,) awfulness. So who's to say a 9-year old boy in his position wouldn't have done the same thing? <br />Personally, I find it startingly realistic. <br /> <br />As for the book as a whole, it is amazing and the cryptic air only adds to the appeal of it. <br /> <br />I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't read it all the way through, but it makes you think. Or, it made me think anyways. And now I'm making my dad read this book because it has real substance.
B000J103YI|5.0|I agree with the previous reviewer, Jennifer Hudson's performance is dynamic. I've seen the original broadway cast with the great Jennifer Holiday, who was a total powerhouse, and now I've seen Hudsons, and her performance may be a bit different but, certainly, no less effective. She deserved her Oscar.   As much as I like both of these ladies, my favorite recording of And I'm Telling You... is now Lillias Whites version from the concert recording. Listen to it if you can. All three are amazing!!   The reviewer who claimed they had to turn off Hudson's recording is very simply, completely closed minded, and was not going to like any version other than Holiday's, no matter who did it.    On another note, why do so many people feel compelled to list the songs from a CD on these pages?? We all know what's there, stop wasting space!!!
B000002GB9|5.0|As Samhot's review said, Styx gets trashed quite a bit these days.  I still like their music (especially this album), and it isn't a nostalgia thing with me.  I have never been one to listen to something to take me back to my youth.  To me, great music/film/novels/TV last for all time, and it doesn't matter what era they were made.  I don't listen to Styx because I like to make fun of their music in the Gen X, \\"ironic\\" way, I just really dig it.  Some of their lyrics (like Angry Young Man) come close to cheese at times, but the sincerity is there, and that makes up for the somewhat naive message of the song.  Every single song here is perfect.  The title track is so valid today (they'll show you photographs/of how your life should be/but there just someone else's fantasy).  With the way the world (especially the USA) worships celebrities, it's nice to hear some music tell us that they're really nothing, and hollow to the core.  Come Sail Away is deserving of every accolade that came its way.  It's a beautiful, poetic, powerful song, with a great, intricate time signature by the underrated John Panozzo and it has that sincerity that is so lacking nowadays.  Miss America is probably the most underrated song in the entire Styx cannon, an acerbic, hilarious, drenched in acid parody of the \\"beautiful people\\".  I don't feel that Styx is ripping off prog rock here.  There are prog rock traces in Styx's music (especially their earlier stuff), though I never really considered them prog rock (Kansas is really the only American band that can share the stage with the British prog rocks bands in my opinion).  They are just a great band that Gen X types like picking on for some reason (Supertramp and REO Speedwagon are 2 others).  So what if they were popular?  So what if they are sincere?  Being popular is not a horrible thing, if you achieve it honestly, and Styx did.
0060885378|3.0|How can Harper be publishing Little House books without Garth Williams' illustrations?!?!  I have loved these books too much to let this happen without saying anything.  Please, please, please, if you like the real, complete books with the original artwork, write to Harper Trophy and tell them to put it back!
B00000DATR|4.0|I just got this last week and so far I like the tracks. I've been listening to Mike Oldfield music since the '70's when he became popular with his music used in the movie The Exorcist. I didn't know he had this disk out, and although its from 1998, its all new to me. If you like Mike Oldfield music you got to check it out!
B000NDIAWO|4.0|The title says it all. Thanks to Wikipedia, I found out that that the European release (not to be confused with the Latin American release) comes with ONE CD and the DVD anthology set! <br /> <br />The CD has all the tracks the US version does (including World Wide Woman, which is listed on the back of the UK version, but excludes \\"Still in love\\" and replaces with a new ballad \\"If\\") but includes \\"Check On It\\" AND Amor Gitano, the only original song off the second US disc. Personally I found the second disc for the US version to be generally useless because it's filled with all of these remixes ans Spanish versions of the same songs you've already heard before. It feels less like a CD and more a like a CD-single.  <br /> <br />The UK version CD also includes the useless \\"remix\\" of Beautiful Liar, which is the exact same song, but I believe it is the radio edit, which cuts down on the instrumental portion.  <br /> <br />So all in all, thats NINETEEN (19) TRACKS, clocking in at just below 80 MINUTES! <br /> <br />Plus, there's the DVD anthology, which unfortanately is in PAL format, so it won't work on your DVD players, BUT since it is also Region 0, it should be able to play on any computer in the world. <br /> <br />I rated it four stars because of the DVD issue, the Get Me Bodied extended mix gets a little cheesy (she name checks her clothing line House of Dereon) and becasue the remix of Beautiful Liar isn't really a remix. I would say this is a five star album otherwise (this album made me a fan of hers), especially if you didn't buy B'day the first time around. But even if you did, the extra tracks should make it totally worth it. That is, if you buy the UK version, which cost me about 21 bucks American (including shipping) from AmazonUK.

1932907009|5.0|As a professional screenwriter who has sold numerous features, I can say with total confidence that this is the one book to buy for pro and amateur screenwriters alike.  I've honestly never seen a book that so succinctly covers everything you need to know -- from idea, to execution, to pitch meetings.  It's all in there and it's all true.  A great resource and great read!
B00004U28G|1.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years.  I had forgotten just how dumb it really is.  I still had a few laughs, though.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Awesome cd.  Probably one of his best.  If you are a Dylan fan you have to own thhis cd.
B000JBWWBK|4.0|My husband lived in France for a year and speaks it well. We both loved this soundtrack because it's got a great mix of different kinds of French songs. Really sets a mood and background.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Time goes backwards but the plot goes forwards.<br />I think that just because of this unique structure, this movie would deserve 5 stars.<br />Appart from that, the production, acting, scripting, filming, etc. are very good.
B000O1799U|5.0|Because of dubious reports on the merits of this film, I never saw it in the theatres, and only bought the single-disc DVD. After watching the film, I think it would be interesting to see the 2nd disc. \\"Dreamgirls\\" is a good film, with very good characters and character development. Bill Condon kept the essence of the goings-on, and the editing of Virginia Katz kept a good flow of events. The cast is outstanding, with Jennifer Hudson centering the film in an auspicious award-winning performance; it is a many-layered performance, and she shines brightest of all. Jamie Foxx & Danny Glover are fine, as are Beyonce and Anika Noni Rose. One of the best performances in the film is by Keith Robinson, who is usually relegated somewhat to the background, but is really a catalyst in the plot as Hudson's brother. There is also some of the best choreography I've seen in a long time (by Fatima Robinson), but not enough. The surprise cameos of John Lithgow & John Krasinski were also a treat. One thing that bothered me about previous reviewers was that it was too \\"white\\", whatever that means. Indeed, as a period piece, where Black musicians weren't allowed on shows like American Bandstand, and had to make due with their own localized record labels, those performers had to break through insurmountable barriers. These performers were intelligent people, and I'm glad they didn't resort to ebonic stereotypes. Eddie Murphy may have deserved the Oscar, if only for his long and illustrious career. But so did Alan Arkin, for the same reason; both actors were killed off early in the film. Eddie certainly gave it energy! But, in the end, it's Hudson you'll remember. Her strength and determination really commands, and she sings well, too. I never found it boring. There's more to say, I'm sure, but these are my immediate reactions.
B000BTGY1O|1.0|Maybe the love of this film comes from the shadowy memory of Truman Capote's book which is much richer and deeper in its execution. This film can only compare as a superficial faded copy of the real thing.<br /><br />I really could care less about Ms. Golightly because this character has no morally redeeming value. She is a user, an opportunist and abuser of other people's kindness. She is a party girl that has the complexity of a paper doll.<br /><br />I can't believe viewers actually forgive Audrey's character at the end. She doesn't deserve the viewer's love and appreciation as she spends 95% of the movie caring for herself and using others which makes any intelligent viewer not care about her (even going to the point of praying for some bloody comeuppance). Sorry, but if you are a habitual abuser of others then you really deserve a life devoid of redemption just because you are tired of being lonely.<br /><br />I lost 2 hours of my life and received no payoff; just some cheese ball sentimental closure that no movie goer in their right mind would buy. This movie lacks any appropriate resolution as if the makers believed Audrey Hepburn's attractiveness could overcome a completely weak script.<br /><br />I guess this movie gives hope to all those hollow mask wearing socialite wannabes who think they can repent at the end of their miserable lives and be saved. This movie is as soul-less as the characters they present.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor; skip the movie and go read the book.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|This is a very different Saw than the other 2 previous ones. I liked this one because it was a totally different scenario. Yes, it was still gruesome and gorey but the story was a different one. If you are a fan of the Saw trilogies, then see this one. If you are not, then see another horror flick. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes the Saw trilogies.
B0000634EV|5.0|I may be in the minority, but I actually like this record slightly better than Down's first album. Both of them are classics, but this one has a more groovy new orleans feel to me. It's also a bit more languid, distorted, and melodic. More dark, and diverse and overall a step up from \\"NOLA\\" if you ask me. It seems more genuine and has more soul than most of Pantera's works... I know that might be a  controversial thing to say... but recently read an interview where Philip Anselmo mentioned how he was in Down for the music and the music only, not playing a role, and you can tell. Also I love the story of how they made the record in a month or so in Phil's barn in Louisiana. Love the lyrics, a lot of focus on addiction. I just love Philip Amselmo's vocals and this has some great guitar work too. If you like \\"Deliverance\\" by COC or \\"Southern Trendkill\\" by Pantera you'll love this. Highlights are: \\"There's Something On My Side,\\" \\"Beautifully Depressed,\\" \\"Stained Glass Cross,\\" \\"Ghosts along the Mississipi\\" but all the tracks are great, no filler here. I recently saw Phil & co on tour in NYC and they really rocked these tunes live too. A must for any metal collection... cannot wait for the third Down album!

B000BBOUU4|2.0|Especially when they don't come close to original. This one makes up a reason for why Wonka is soooo silly. The author didn't even do that in his book!! Not as good as the original.
B000O178BY|5.0|Year Zero,is a great nin cd.  the great NIN sound is on here ,it is satisfying to me.  Trents voice is good  from whisper to rant. Year zero is one of the best NIN cds i like all the songs.  Trent improves greatly over With Teeth and the remixes that came out since The Fragile, Year Zero leaves no doubt about the greatness of NIN. Year zero would be a good cd  to start a NIN collection the great musical styles of NIN are here and its current.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is my first John Mayer CD and I love it. I actually like it the more and more I listen to it. He goes from soft and mellow to a little more upbeat throughout the CD. Put it this way, simply from this one CD I will buy his next album without even hearing one song from it first.
1904920209|5.0|This book/DVD combination is an accessible introduction to artisan bread baking.  In my opinion, the DVD alone is worth the price of the book/DVD together.  There are more complex books that delve into preferments, retarded fermentation and sourdough, but this is a simple introduction that will inspire bakers to fire up the oven. <br /> <br />The book is broken into five sections, each dealing with a different dough formula: white (that's white as in French baguette, not Wonder Bread), olive, brown, rye and sweet doughs.  I have made a few of the formulas and they are simple, sound and delicious.  Small chapters also deal with ingredients, technique and loaf shaping.  All in all, the book is solid and informative, as well as inspirational.  It makes you want to bake. <br /> <br />The bonus DVD that's included shows Richard Bertinet working a batch of white (French) dough.  Now whether you REALLY have to smack the dough on the counter is debatable, but the joy that Richard derives from working the dough is certain.  The real gem is the forming of the dough into baguettes and rolls.  Loaf forming is nearly impossible to learn from a book.  The only way to catch on is by standing next to a master at work, but a close second is watching a master do it on video (this DVD).  The only other DVD I have seen that deals with detailed loaf shaping is from King Arthur Flour (also recommended highly). <br /> <br />If you do pick up this book and have people over for dinner, make a few of the fougasses (the leafy looking loaf on the cover of the book)!!!  On the DVD, Richard provides the details on how to form them.  They are simple to make (once you have the dough made), wonderful to eat, and will get you raves from your guests.  Trust me on this one. <br />
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Afterglow by Sarah McLachlan is surprisely moving and wonderfully produced. I am not normally a McLachlan super-fan but some of her songs before this album are quite engaging. I decided to give this album a chance, standout tracks include: Time, Perfect Girl, Dirty Little Secret, Stupid, and Answer. Sarah's voice has improved and her lyrics are at its strongest. I could listen to the track, Time all day long, it sucks you in after the first 20 seconds, amazing! So whether you hate or love her, Afterglow will have you bathed in it for awhile. Enjoy!
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Greatest movie ever. I will watch everything Levitt is in until he's dead.
B000002L80|5.0|This album is beautiful because of the vocal harmonies provided by Tina Weymouth. She was a perfect counterpart to David Byrne's odd voice. When he went solo, he lost all of this.<br /><br />Hands down, my favorite song on the album is Road To Nowhere. The vocal harmonies are delicious and the song reminds me of the awesome video that they created for the song.
1582701709|4.0|<br /> <br />\\"The Secret\\" is an excellent beginner level book on the power of the human mind and the Creative Potential we all have in our lives. <br /> <br />That said, the operative word is \\"beginner\\" level.   As numerous reviewers have pointed out, there are far more profound and detailed works on \\"manifesting,\\"  \\"power of the mind,\\" etc.  Still---how many people have ever READ or even HEARD ABOUT  Wallace Wattles, F.W. Sears, Charles Fillmore, or even Esther Hicks, aka \\"Abraham?\\" <br /> <br />The genius of this work is that it has made these concepts palatable to mass consciousness---and I believe that is a very good thing.  <br /> <br />Once people, who until now would never have entertained these ideas have \\"tasted\\" them, they can go on to more real in depth \\"how-to\\" material. <br /> <br />My personal  favorite is the work of \\"Abraham,\\" channeled by Esther Hicks. \\"Abraham\\" gives a far more comprehensive and really usable set of principles for effectively using the Law of Attraction in everyday life.  The \\"Law of Attraction\\" CD set by Esther and Jerry Hicks is absolutely fantastic--with extremely clear distinctions and guidelines for people who really want to practice this material. <br /> <br />Many reviewers seem to be put off by the idea of \\"positive thinking\\"---and seem to feel that it doesn't work.  <br /> <br />Well, a careful reading of The Secret will reveal that the real key is Positive FEELING, which is the result of CONSISTENT positive thinking. It is the power of our vibrational core energized by coherent positive feeling states that can really begin to make changes in our world. <br /> <br />Rhonda Byrne's The Secret just gives a taste of these principles and ideas.  I would recommend interested readers go on to \\"Abraham's\\"  Law of Attraction CD's mentioned above, or to the work of F.W. Sears for more in-depth usable information. <br /> <br />While some have commented that LOA principles are simply \\"feel-good\\" pap for Upper Middle Class Americans,I have personally known people (myself included) who have consistently applied these principles in real life with amazing results. So I absolutely know \\"The Secret\\"  works when  applied  in a coherent manner over time. <br /> <br />All in all?...........The Secret is an elegant, though somewhat superficial statement of LOA principles.  But it has obviously struck a chord with the mass market---and hopefully will be a harbinger of a rise in mass consciousness.  I liked the CD set equally---an excellent way to keep your mind and intention \\"in tune\\" while driving or throughout the day. <br /> <br />See my review on The Secret DVD for some more comments. <br />
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I had my doubts about Daniel Craig but, he has proven to be one of the best Bonds.  Every time you think the movie is over there is more to come.  It will be interesting to see where the Bond writers will go from here.  If your into the movie making background and how scenes were made, disk two is a must for you. Bond, James Bond, is back!
B000NA1OXY|5.0|This CD of avril lavigne is awesome it's got a couple catchie songs that some people can relate to...if you like avril's first and second cd you are going to LOVE her third!!!
B00005221M|4.0|I love the original movie. It is one of my most feel good movies of all time. I was really disappointed with the way they edited this dvd. The vocal part that is missing was a huge hole in what was a wonderful movie. Why do they have to mess things up that have a good thing going for them.
B000077VR3|5.0|Moulin Rouge is one of those movies that really stands out from the crowd, for its sheer uniqueness and for being highly-stylized. Being absolutely hilarious is a plus too! <br /> <br />I am a fan of Baz Luhrmann movies, because they present a modernized yet over-the-top fantasy world that refuses to apologize for itself. If you liked his modernized version of Romeo + Juliet, you'll love Moulin Rouge, it's even better and much wilder. <br /> <br />There are SO many lyrical references to other songs in this movie, that it might take dozens of repeat viewings to try and catch them all. And the way that lyrics are blended into dialogue is unprecedented and one of the best parts of the movie. <br /> <br />If you liked other highly-stylized movies such as Sin City or 300, you will also like Moulin Rouge. <br /> <br />If you like movie-musicals that blend moviemaking techniques with stage performance, such as Chicago, you will definitely like this one too. <br /> <br />Overall the movie is just too creative and artistic to be easy to describe, so I'm just going to tell you to go see it. As long as you let go of any expectation of realism, just sit back and enjoy the hilarious and heartwrenching show.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This movie is a phenomenal collection to your movie library.  It stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who make the perfect match on screen.  The movie is not meant to be fancy pants, but laid back and conversational.    It takes place on the streets of Paris, and Jesse and Celine meet by chance again after a nine year hiatus. They converse on topics broad and small. The denouement of the previous film, Before Sunrise, is worth the wait for the this sequel.  I won't spill anything, but this is definitely a delightful, funny, and intellectual watch.
B00008CMR6|5.0|I was under the impression this movie wasn't very good and it really is better than some of the reviews given about the movie. It also was different than Rio Bravo and El Dorado despite what had been said. It is a great addition to any John Wayne movie collector.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I've been a fan for over 25 years and listening to this album makes me feel like a kid again. That old band that you used to know and love has come back with a brand new set of songs that are both inspiring and intoxicating. This stuff is TOO good! I can't put it down and don't want to.
B000EGCITG|4.0|This I have to say is one of her best CD I have lister to for while.  When she be out her first singal it was ok but when I say the video to U & UR hand I like it and side this might be a good CD after all.  So if you like rock Pink get this CD it is really good.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I want to like it I really do! But it just isn't happening. Maybe I just need to put it away and come back to it in a few days. But if it was great I shouldn't have to. As others have said too many times already.....what happened to these guys? It's one thing to \\"evolve\\", but quite another to just keep producing lame mediocre music. It's just OK. Nothing that grabs you and takes you away. No \\"goose bumb\\" factor. And no I don't want old Rush, I just want GOOD Rush. I've seen these guys 30+ times....at least once on every tour since Hemispheres. Probably won't again. This album has it's moments where you think it's going to go some where but then it just drags on and doesn't change. There's really no substance here, just cranking out a CD for the sake of some $$$ ?? I don't know. Everything up till Counterparts was awesome. Then they just lost it. At least the production on this CD is miles ahead of VT....hence 3 stars instead of 2. Alex should have taken some lessons from the Porcupine Tree project that he did a solo for. Which BTW, \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" as well as all of the other PT stuff is great and just keeps getting better.  <br /> <br />Time to retire I think.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|A few of the songs on S&A seem like they fit together nicely. Too many of them seem like odds and ends of song ideas stitched together poorly. I'm talking about the music. In this respect it resembles a lot of Test For Echo, an album I listened to once and never again. I call them \\"Frankensongs\\" -- a piece of this, a piece of that. Sew it together. It's a song! Not.  <br /> <br />The frequent complaint with Geddy's excess harmonizing is valid. It is grating on the ears. Unlike Gordon Lightfoot, a choir of Geddy Lee's is just annoying. Also, I simply don't like the musical intervals he tends to use for harmonization. Further, the harmony vocals clutter the mix unnecessarily. Better a solo voice, especially in Geddy's case.  <br /> <br />I loved most of Vapor Trails, apart from the sonic sludginess, because the songs were well-conceived. A better producer could have prodded the boys to make more of the material they had for this album. Perhaps if they had reduced it to ten songs, and smoothed over some of the musical rough edges, I could be more enthusiastic. <br /> <br />Rush has a rich creative legacy. At their age they are entitled to experiment. You are not obligated to like it, or to buy it, though. I heard my friend's copy, and that cured me. I will not buy this. Please, listen before you buy. Otherwise, you encourage them in their mediocrity. <br /> <br />Because most of the album is such a musical turn-off for me, I didn't delve deeply into the lyrics. I find comparisons between the \\"fundamentalists\\" of the West with the religion of \\"convert at the edge of the sword\\" rather thoughtless. But beyond that, we already know Peart doesn't believe in a higher power. He's self contained, self-sufficient, the New World Man. He needs nothing but \\"love,\\" but doesn't define that word. But we've heard this about fifty times before, and frankly it is just stale.  <br /> <br />That about sums up the album. Some creativity here, no doubt, but not fully-formed, and the messageis starting to wear thin.
B000O75F7C|4.0|Really should be a 5 but I can't keep giving PT 5 starts on everything.  If you like the last two albums you'll love this too. They keep progressing just enough to keep it fresh, but not enough to lose their style. Outstanding production / engineering / mastering as usual too. If you have a good system this is a must have CD, as are all of their CD's. Also if you have the equipment the DVD-Audios of Deadwing and In Abstensia are phenominal!     The boys from Rush could take a lesson. Buy this if you bought the new Rush and were disappointed.
B000CNDIZE|4.0|I'm docking a star for 2 tracks where Sia tries to sing like Nelly Furtado. Otherwise, a pretty great album for the following tracks at the very least: <br /> <br />Rewrite <br />Sunday <br />Breathe Me(wow) <br />The Bully <br />Don't Bring Me Down <br /> <br />What some people are missing about Sia is that she doesn't belt out the showtunes like Barbara Streisand, and that was NEVER the point! Sia follows directly in the line of intense, moody confessional singer-songwriters like Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan. IT's about baring her soul to the audience, and she definitely does it here to great effect.  <br /> <br />Also to a previous reviewer who said that Sia ripped off Tori Amos in \\"Breate Me\\", well that's some neat trick to be able to sing write and sing like that, no? Besides, Tori never wrote such straightforward lyrics, the Queen of Obtuseness.
B000BNI95Y|4.0|bebe definetly has a unique sound. I only understand a little bit of what she is saying but I still like to listen to it. The spanish is a little different because she is from Spain
B000MV9026|3.0|I was very disappointed with the video. <br /> <br />I had waited quite a while for it to come to the stores. It was not at all what I had expected. <br /> <br />It is definitely for little children.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|I first got this album after hearing there song Tears Don't Fall and I enjoyed it a lot. I like the fact that they mix good vocals with good screaming. I like screaming but I don't like too much of it and these guys give a good blend of both vocals and screaming. I am amazed that the lead singer can sing, scream and play guitar at the same time. This is a good album from a very talented band and I am impressed that everyone except the drummer gives significant vocal contributions. Recommended for anyone who enjoys Hardcore or Emocore. Highlights are Tears don't Fall, Suffocating  Under Words of Sorrow, the title track and All Theses Things I Hate (Revolve Around You).
B000O178BY|5.0|Its the music that I care about - all this \\"Year 2022\\" hype and all the publicity stunts just bore me. Year Zero is a very good CD so it can stand on its own. I love the bass-heavy tracks and very slick way each track is put together. I recommend listening to Year Zero on a decent system with good speakers instead of headphones, to get the full effect of the CD.
076531178X|4.0|I really wish that amazon would introduce a more intricate rating system than five stars, as this would get about 4.5 stars from me.  After many failed attempts at starting up various fantasy series, Brandon Sanderson has delivered something refreshing and vastly entertaining.  This is very nearly a five star novel, though there are a few simple discrepencies that keep Mistborn from being legendary.    Pros:  - I was immideately pulled in by the bizarre world environment here.  The idea of a land completely covered in ash at all times is strange and interesting.  - The \\"magic\\" system, if it can be called that, is unique and a breath of fresh air.  For me, a lot of fantasy is ruined by overuse of magic and lack of explanation about how magic works.   His use of metals and Allomancy is genius and it's apparent that Sanderson invested a lot of time into this system. It's fun and believable.  - Sanderson displays great world-building talents in Mistborn.  Not only to we have a strange backdrop in the environment, but good history to fill it with.  The mists and the Mistwraiths are weird and different.  - There is no lack of action here.  While I might have liked a little more description on the larger battle scenes, the Allomancy battles were just plain fun to read.  With the characters using their abilities to push themselves through the air and hurl large metal objects, it was almost as if they were battling superheroes, and strangely enough this really works.  He paid great attention to the rules and science of the Allomancy he created and applied them to these battle scenes well.    Cons:  - As others have noticed, characterization could use a little work.  While Vin, Kelsier, Elend and Sazed were descriptive characters, a lot of the others on the crew (Dockson, Clubs, Breeze, Yeden) felt a little too cookie cutter and I found it hard to remember exactly what those characters did and what their individual roles were.  - Some of the dialogue is a little too typical as with many other fantasy books.  This is one aspect that I rarely find to my liking in fantasy -as few authors seem to do it very well- and it isn't so bad here, but a lot of the conversations seemed a little unbelieveable.  There were a lot sappy moments between the characters, some of which I find hard to swallow.  (Perhaps I've become spoiled by Martin and Hobb, where distrust and hate between a lot of the characters make dialogue and character drama more believable.)    The flaws with Mistborn were hardly enough to keep me from thourougly enjoying it.  Every great fantasy author has their strengths, and Sanderson's are apparent.  This book is unique with a lot of great ideas.  The only thing that's very typical is the tyrannical Lord Ruler and his thousand-year reign, but the author handles it very well and shows that cliche isn't always a bad thing.  And the conclusion to Mistorn was fantastic.  All of the plot threads were handled well and in clever ways, the action and final confrontations were great.      I will look forward to reading whatever else Sanderson has to offer.  Read it, enjoy it and tell others.  Good fantasy in a sea of mediocre deserves praise.
0399226907|4.0|I first started using this book with my son after taking a sign language class that used this book.  My son has taken to this book and loves flipping thru the pages using his signs.  The colors are nice and bright in typical Eric Carle fashion.  Board books are a favorite in our home and this is constantly in use.
0446528056|5.0|DEAR JOHN is story about the true meaning of love and what someone is willing to do for it.  The story is divided into three parts: a beginning, middle and end - all from the perspective of John Tyree.  Part I is the introduction of how he sees himself, his childhood experiences, family (lack of mother and detached father), and how he met Savannah Lynn Curtis during a military leave, the girl he never dreamed he would ever be with but loves deeply.  Part II describes John's time in the army, the letters and phone calls in-between, how the relationship changed and other circumstances in life that are out of anyone's control but somehow manage to change everything.  Finally, Part III is the realization of the result of the relationship, how each character has changed/grown and how true love never really dies but can drive you to make decisions that can change your life forever.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book.  It's not a mushy happily ever after tale of two madly in-love teens who find happiness in the end together.  His love for Savannah never dies, nor does hers for him.  But, as a result of life' circumstances, John reenlists in the army and Savannah just cannot handle the time apart any longer. It is a story of love and the transformation of one person from a rebellious misunderstood young man, to an adult who learns the true value of love, family, and friendship.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks does an excellent job of delivering another classic story.  The first person perspective takes you along John's journey through several years that shape the man he becomes and his ultimate understanding of what love means.  You experience his emotions, his realizations, and witness his development.  This is a truly beautiful story that will touch your heart.
0399224459|5.0|My son absolutely LOVES this book.  In fact, I had picked it up a few times to purchase and put it down.  A friend left it at our house and my son couldn't put it down.  We our on our second copy since the first one got worn out- amazingly.  It has few words, great art/colors a definite  must have on the infant/child bookshelf.  My son at 12 months couldn't stop reaching for this book and continues to at 16 months.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|What a fresh take on the Bond Icon. It is always hard to compare Bonds as they all hail from different decades and social gestalts. Having said that, Craig is maybe the best bond ever. I know, I know . . this will sound like sacrilege to all the hard-core Connery fans (and I am one!).  Watch this movie ! Also lots of great stuff in the DVD extras. If you have the other newly released 2 disc, remastered Bond films( which are great- especially the older ones. To see all that 60's stuff in great resolution , color and sound is just fantastic !.)    Anyway , 4 Stars !!
0805047905|5.0|I started reading this to my son around two months of age and he at 16 months contiues to look thru this book daily.  We taught my son sign language and this book helped us with all of our animals.  It has been a favorite in our house along with other Eric Carle books.  I find my son reading this on his own making all the animal sounds and using his sign language!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|So after one full week of listening, the album is really growing on me. <br />It's somewhere between good and great. <br />Overall, there are elements of everything they have done, and yet sounds like no other Rush album. <br /> <br />People need to remember  - All Rush albums are DIFFERENT! That's what I love about them - there's always a different Rush period/sound to listen to. And, since all Rush albums are different, they all take time to get used to. <br /> <br />It really is a great selection of songs. This is a very mature album. My favorite on the CD changes by day and by listen (IMO the mark of a great album). Give it a chance.  Listen with an open mind...
B000O75F7C|5.0|I've quickly become a Porcupine Tree fan.  I purchased Deadwing and In Absentia first, and then followed that by getting older works.  I think Steven Wilson is an amazing song-crafter (for lack of a better descriptor). When I first purchased Fear of a Blank Planet and looked at the total song count - 6 - I was a little disappointed.  After I listened to it once, I was struck at the slight evolution their music appeared to take on it.  Now, I can't stop listening to it.  Gavin Harrison is an off-the-charts great drummer and he's had his chains loosened on this CD.  Overall, this is a stunning piece of music, and has to be considered one of the very best from PT and one of the very best for 2007 period.
0316096199|1.0|I'm very surprised that this book has such good reviews! I was really looking forward to reading it only to find that the grammar and spelling mistakes fill this book so badly that I could not even stand to read it. If errors don't bother you then go ahead and give this a try but if you want to read a book that doesn't keep distracting you because of mistakes then I suggest you keep on searching.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|If you like Evanescence you will love this new album!  I loved it better than fallen.
1400062756|5.0|If manage people, want to understand yourself or are involved in teaching or communicating then this book is for you.  A simple but powerful for framework for understanding how intrinsic and extrinsic motivations work.  Fascinating examples of why \\"teaching\\" to the test and managing via competition don't work.   As a great manager friend of mine used to say organizational culture is what happens when the boss isn't around.  Read this book and get some insights into what makes people and yourself tick.
B000006MV8|4.0|This holds very special significance for me, being one of the very first albums I ever owned, well, on permanent loan to me by a boyfriend I last saw on my 16th birthday. I used to lie on the floor and cry to Baby Blue and the intensity and hard knocks these guys experienced within just a few years adds to the precious worth it holds for me. We all suffered in our separate ways. It's so heart-wrenching even today and as with so many of my old favourites it still has the kick it always did, they present this as though every line comes from the very deepest places in their hearts, and for this I am ever so grateful.
1582701709|5.0|I was first told about The Secret, from my father. i decided to purchase the book and i think i read it in about two days. I just couldn't put the book down! As i read i began to feel the improved wealth around me and a true belief that i had the wealth in that moment.  <br />It really is a true eye opener and an inspiration to feel and believe that you can have anything that you want. <br />If you only buy one book this year, please buy 'the secret'
0385335997|5.0|Some years ago I had started to read this series and made it halfway through Dragonfly in Amber before I stopped, for some reason.  Not too long ago I decided to begin the series again and have not been able to put them down since!  The story of Claire and Jamie is absolutely amazing...Diana Gabaldon has the knack of bringing you right into the world of Claire and Jamie, so much so that you can picture everything with perfect clarity.  I just started reading Voyager 3 days ago and I am almost done with it.  Once you start reading, it is extremely hard to put the book down.  And I must say that these books are the only ones that have ever brought tears to my eyes!  The stories are so interesting that despite the length of each of the books, you fly right through them as if they were merely a couple of chapters.  Diana writes them with such attention to historical details, that I don't find myself saying \\"that never happened that way!\\"  In fact, in my research into Highland history, I came across a story of a John Fraser who in fact survived the killings after the battle of Culloden, as Jamie did, although he was injured much worse than Jamie was! <br /> <br />I am so glad that I gave this series a second chance, and will be quite sad once I have finished them, I will more than likely go back and give each and every one a second read!!
0812975219|4.0|Taleb truly has a talent for thinking clearly and seeing right to the heart of many issues.  That said, his arguments are often haphazardly developed and so rife with condescension that the book can be hard to stomach.
0767827902|5.0|Having just seen this film for the first time what can I say, I'm totally <br />totally blown away. I won't bother going into any details as the reviews below heap more than enough superlatives on this little beauty. The pity is that in Australia this film is unknown, certainly no one I know has heard of it, and I only became curious when I saw it featured on a Doco of 70's movies. One of those rare movies where all the elements of the film making craft stand out brilliantly. Sure don't make 'em like they used to.
B000MV9026|4.0|I really like the spanish version, very funny, great work in the animation and 3d graphics.
006054094X|1.0|Folks, just because the guy wrote a controversial piece that \\"turns Western history on it's head\\" and just because he is passionate about it DOESN'T MEAN IT'S CORRECT!!!! GAAAHH!! makes my brain hurt... <br /> <br />Mr. Menzies is obvously a fanatic of his own theory and he injects any tiny bit of conjecture into the parameters of this theory. I wouldn't have been surprised if he started to posit that Sasquatch was, in fact, a Chinese Admiral whom let an expedition to Antarctica because he heard they had great suishi down there. <br /> <br />The book starts out with some compelling & reasonable evidence of limited Chinese exploration but by the end you might get a creeping suspicion that you have been suckered. Mr Menzies starts to reach at straws towards the end and it invalidates, for me, he original somewhat-sound but limited evidence he does have for Chinese exploration. <br /> <br />
B000NA28IE|4.0|I saw the movie before reading the book and although there were many differences, I really enjoyed the movie.  Ed Speelers & Jeremy Irons were fantastic!  Also, Rachel Weisz as the voice of Saphira was perfect!  It was a fun tale of a farm boy, learning of a destiny he could never have imagined & grabbing hold of that destiny and embracing it.  I do wish they would have kept to how the Raz'Zac & Durza were trying to capture Eragon (as in the book), not kill him, plus had he been captured (as in the book) it would have made it all the more exciting.  Still, overall, I give this movie a definite 2 thumbs up!  I really hope they do a sequel and bring back the original actors.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|a couple of songs were ok..it was cute , upbeat...nothing worth listening to unless ur in the car and really bored or need something to sing along to in the shower....honestly i could have came up with the same lyrics and the same tunes...shes lucky shes pretty and has a great voice, thats the only thing this album has to offer.
B00000G6NI|5.0|not every every record benefits from being digitized.  they don't sound right.  this reissue of rory gallagher's 'photo finish' does.  in fact, it sounds even better.  imagine, one of roy's best, now even better, on compact disc.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is a great WWII documentary. This series was produced in the 1970s, but is still one of the best, most thorough sets around on WWII. A must have for anyone interested in the history of the war.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|The sound of this album is very relaxed and joyful. <br />Eric looses his shoulder round into a comfortable slope. <br />It is nicely laid back yet has some vitality.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Any fan of the Godfather films will be pleased with this set. It is nicely packaged, and the films speak for themselves. A must for anyone who has a movie collection.
0553278223|5.0|Having read numerous Bradburian works, a predominant theme emerges. Ray Bradbury's prowess as a crafter of science fiction lies not solely in the realm of Verne or Wells, depicting fantastic technology in an alien world, whether it be in the far reaches of space or 20,000 leagues under the sea. Rather, he highlights heavily upon social phenomena in the context of a futuristic environment; gadgets and new-fangled interplanetary transportation appear as merely garnish, an element of setting rather than theme.<br /><br />Chronicles is no different. In the very same manner of Farenheit 451, Bradbury brilliantly illustrates the rise and fall of social practices, removing terrestrial constraints in an alien setting. An ancient race of martians is exterminated by disease, subsequently replaced by human life, and in turn, a saga of the growth of America emerges. From the character of a post-modern Johnny Appleseed to the emotional disconnection and physical separation of a nuclear showdown on the neighboring Earth, Bradbury ironically highlights the American heritage while alighting upon the social implications of modern-day practices such as nuclear proliferation.<br /><br />Although the novel is naturally a series of installments compiled into a single entity, the piece flows remarkably well from subject to subject, following a chronological structure and drawing upon previously described events. For the fan of Ray Bradbury, individual filled with ardor for the genre of science fiction, or even the casual peruser of pages, The Martian Chronicles proves to be a highly satisfying read.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|Whiles the movie wasn't exactly my cup of tea, the score was like a taste of heaven and it's even better on the album than it appears in the movie. Zimmer ditches his great action packed stuff and writes what to me is by far my favorite of his. It's richly detailed with themes and motifs that just boggle the mind at how great they are to listen to, and his use of strings and choirs are just amazing. In fact I think Zimmer's choral writing here is probably some of the best use of choir I've ever heard in filmmusic.<br /><br />The movie being about religion the score is very religious with the choral and strings stuff sounding like something you'd hear in a church, but the great thing Zimmer does is not go too over the top but just give it that religious sound mixed with his own patent dramatic chord progressions that we're used to hearing from him. A lot of the stuff on the album did remind of not only Zimmer's stuff in the past but also some the stuff from Harry Gregson Williams' music from \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\". Namely that weird whistling woodwinds that moves around the speakers that Gregson-Williams first used in \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" and some of the choral writing also sounded similar to the choir stuff in \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\". I'm guessing that's why he received a thank you from Zimmer on the album.<br /><br />There are many highlights on the album and for me the ones I can't stop listening to are \\"Rose of Arimathea\\", \\"L'Esprit Des Gabriel\\", \\"Fructus Gravis\\", \\"Poisoned Chalice\\", and \\"Chevaliers de Sangreal\\". They are all very varied tracks that contain certain motifs that are just to die for. My personal favorite among all of them is the lengthy \\"Rose of Arimathea\\" which sounds like a more religious version of Zimmer's stuff from \\"Crimson Tide\\". I really love the great choral stuff he uses on that track, especially the bellowing male choir around the 3:33 mark. That little ostinato melody he has on that track can also be heard on \\"L'Esprit Des Gabriel\\", except it's played a lot faster there but both variations are great.<br /><br />Some Bernard Hermann influences can be heard on the album, especially on the track \\"Fructus Gravis\\" which I was really shocked by because I never knew that Zimmer was a Hermann. Morricone and Vangelis yeah but never Hermann. I've seen the movie just once so I can't remember what score goes with what scene but I do remember that the adventurous \\"Chevaliers de Sangreal\\" was played for the last moments of the film, and some of that great solo viola stuff on a lot of the other tracks. Hopefully someday I'll get to watch the movie again and figure out which cue goes with what scene.<br /><br />Definitely one of the best things to come out of 2006 and I dare anyone to listen to this album and not become a Zimmer fan. Hope he writes more great dramatic stuff like this and abandons the big loud repetitive action stuff if he ever wants to win another Oscarit's played a lot faster there but both variations are great.  <br /> <br />Some Bernard Hermann influences can be heard on the album, especially on the track \\"Fructus Gravis\\" which I was really shocked by because I never knew that Zimmer was a Hermann.

0743298020|3.0|I'd have given this book 3 1/2 stars if I could.  At first I was captivated, but the characters couldn't hold me.  The story was good, until the end when it became rather weak.  The setting was evocative, but the characters were flat.  With each reference to Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and The Woman in White (of which there were many), I felt that I was reading the work of a wannabee.
1892005034|5.0|Fast and easy to read.  Excellent book.
B000002GA8|5.0|My mother introduced me to the music of Yes, and subsequently, Rick Wakeman. This album was her first recommendation, so I picked it up. Being a fan of the original Jules Verne book, I looked forward to hearing Rick's musical take on the story. Needless to say, I was not disappointed; each piece of music is well worth the price of admission. The added narration really adds to the overall production. This would certainly be a great album to witness live. One interesting note is that there are actually four tracks on the CD (not two, as the listing indicates).
B00005T30L|5.0|I've loved this movie since it came out in theaters. With an amazing cast of cult and mainstream stars, you cannot go wrong.  Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch shine as the main characters, Seymour and Enid, while Scarlett Johannsen is great as Enid's motivated friend and foil, Rebecca. <br /> <br />I love the comic, and this movie is a nice complement to it. Even if you're not familiar with the comic, this movie will make you take a look at life, school and the BS that pervades all aspects of society. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|While this may not be a movie for everyone - this is a highly enjoyable and thought provoking movie.  If you give it a chance and get the message it will really surprise you.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|There's 334 other reviews so I'll skip the movie comments except to say it was fun.<br /><br />  Snipes and Goyer (the writer) have a good track.  Snipes explains the rationale of each of the fight scenes and has stories of stunt mishaps.<br /><br />  The Director, Del Toro and the producer Frankfurt have a party on their track.  They mock some of Goyer's dialogue and applaud the stuff that worked just right.  A lot of fun.<br /><br />  There's even an isolated score track!  (Just the music.)
B000EGCITG|5.0|Even though the album was overshadow by stupid girls, this album is definely worth listing to, all the songs have a strong message and you can listen to them over and over again. Pink should have won a grammy for this album. beatiful cd. Great tittle too.  <br /> <br />
1594200823|5.0|This is a book review I wrote for my graduate course in Christian Ethics.  Feel free to comment.<br /><br />What's for dinner?<br /><br />The Omnivore's Dilemma, by Michael Pollan (Knight Professor of Journalism at the Graduate School of Journalism at UC-Berkeley and director of the Knight Program in Science and Environmental Journalism ) serves up one of the most thoughtful and unforgettable journeys into what he refers to as three principle food chains: the industrial, the organic, and the hunter-gatherer.  His personal journey through four actual meals deriving from these three food chains enlightens his readers by taking them into the worlds (industrial and organic) of agriculture and food production.  Pollan explores the ever present question of \\"what's for dinner?\\" by delving into the deeper ethical issues that every omnivore ought to consider.<br /><br /> Extremely engaging and pleasant to read, The Omnivore's Dilemma's 411 pages go by surprisingly fast.  Michael Pollan is a winsome and thoughtful writer who has the ability to present an extremely controversial and specialized topic in such a way that the reader is not forced to reading this journey dictionary in hand.  It is evident that Pollan cares deeply about his topic going to extremes to gather information and spending much of his life researching and developing thoughts before they are published.  Pollan has a deep and diverse bibliography that only bolsters his thoughtful presentation of this issue and makes his credibility very difficult to question.<br /><br />The Menu<br /><br />Pollan dives deep into the source of the issues of what he calls \\"America's national eating disorder\\" by tracking the three food chains (see above) all the way to the source of where food begins.  Pollan's journey starts by exploring the world of corn and corn farming by working, temporarily, on two very different farms.  His voyage continues with the purchase of a steer for slaughter, slaughtering or \\"harvesting\\" chickens, hunting wild boar, and foraging for morels in Northern California.<br /><br /> Michael Pollan's chief concern is with the industrial food chain.  This industrial food chain has enabled us to eat our meals without the inconvenience of knowing where our food comes from or what was involved in getting it to our plates.  In Pollan's opinion (which is difficult to refute) this industrial food making process has divorced humans from our natural relationship to our food.  Pollan believes that when we don't consider where our food comes from and how it got to us we are endangering our health, the environment and the order of the natural world.  By venturing into the industrial food chain Pollan reveals to his readers the truth behind corn, one of our most basic crops.  He also reveals the dangers and abuses of CAFOs (Confined Animal Feeding Operations; aka feedlots) along with many other concerns namely: environmental, biological, and economical which are direct results of the arrival of the industrial food chain.<br /><br /> As Pollan shares with us in the introduction his intended readers are those who share his concern for eating properly instead of \\"eating in ignorance.\\"  He does not exclude anyone else who might read this book but he does caution those who don't want change in their eating endeavors because after reading this book their appetites might be ruined.<br /><br /> The introduction of The Omnivore's Dilemma gives us a road map of Pollan's goals with the book.  His construct is to build the book around 4 meals that he actually eats.  His first meal is from the industrial food chain; a dinner with his family from McDonalds which is eaten in the car.  The second meal is from the Industrial Organic (he refers to as an oxymoron) food chain which he eats alone; an organic T.V. dinner.  His third meal is more true to the word organic and is eaten on Joel Salatin's (the owner of Polyface Farm in Virginia where Michael worked one summer) farm made entirely from produce and livestock grown on Joel's farm.  The fourth meal is what he calls \\"the perfect meal\\" which is the hunter-gatherer meal made almost entirely from ingredients that Michael gathered or killed on his own.<br /><br />The Dilemma<br /><br /> The Omnivore's Dilemma was first recommended to me last summer.  I was extremely busy at the time but the person who recommended this book to me is someone that I respect greatly and so I wanted to take his advice seriously.  So I did the next best thing and recommended it to my father-in-law who read it quite quickly and agreed that this book is a must read.  A must read?  That seemed awfully compelling.  I think about the books that are a must read and The Omnivore's Dilemma probably would not have been on the forefront.  Maybe a book on abortion, or same-sex marriage or eating disorders would be up there but a book on food, really, is this necessary?<br /><br /> In his book Pollan makes the statement that \\"Agriculture has done more to reshape the natural world than anything else we humans do...\\"  Really?  Agriculture?  What about wars, religion, works of art or works of literature?  This struck me as quite bold but one would have a difficult time arguing with Michael Pollan after thoughtfully considering the challenges brought forth in his book.<br /><br />The dilemma of The Omnivore's Dilemma is that no matter who we are we cannot ignore the fact that we have to eat.  Our eating does not take place in a void but holds consequences not only for our own bodies but also the world around us.  Considering where food comes from, whether we are eating at McDonalds, Longhorn or shopping at our local grocery store is just the beginning of contemplating these consequences.  We see commercials describing \\"corn fed beef\\" as a term to portray the best kind of meat but in fact cows are ruminants and were never supposed to eat corn.  Thoughtful reflection of what it means to be human should cause us to consider these issues and many other ethical concerns that encompass the question, \\"what's for dinner?\\"<br /><br />The Spiritual Dilemma<br /><br /> Taking inventory of all of the ethical issues there are for Christians in Pollan's book, I was challenged to do some soul searching.  Although not a Christian himself, (his self-renunciation of faith and his continued attribution to evolution as responsible for our development are made clear in his book) Pollan seems to be a delightful person who is deeply concerned for our environmental wellbeing.  This seems to be eons beyond where our current evangelical community is on these issues.  I began to think about what is offered for Christians on the issues of food, agriculture and environment so I perused our local Christian bookstore.<br /><br /> After doing a computer search and looking up words like food, agriculture, and environment, I came up with results like The Total Temple Makeover (apparently a play off of the idea that our bodies are temples with advice as a how to \\"makeover\\" this temple), The Hallelujah Diet, and Stress Less.  A search on agriculture produced nothing and looking for environmental issues brought up only the newest edition of Praise Baby.  It is not my goal to criticize these particular books, having never read them (or listened to them, Praise Baby is a CD).  But if there is nothing on this issue in what we might refer to as the contemporary Christian library this tells me that the Evangelical world is not even thinking about this issue.  This exposes the reality of the stereotypes one might see in the political and scientific world regarding Evangelical Christians.<br /><br /> As Christian Believers we must think about the issues that Pollan brings to the table in regards to ethical eating.  Exploring some of the larger issues that Pollan investigates, I found myself reading mouth wide open.  For example:  My wife and I and most everyone in the area where we live get our food from our local chain grocer.  In any of the packagedfoods that we purchase one or more of the staple ingredients, in some form or another, is corn.  Now this might not seem so bad considering the fact that corn is thought of as a vegetable.  However what we are not aware of is the fact that most of the corn grown in the United States is not a profitable endeavor for the American Farmer.  In fact the face of post-WWII American agriculture has corn smeared all over it, leaving the American farmer without a towel.<br /><br /> When the industrial revolution took hold in the world of agriculture there was no going back.  The result was the creation of the monoculture farm instead of the storybook polyculture farm that we read about in stories like Charlotte's Web or Animal Farm.  The push to for America to grow and flourish drove the USDA to offer incentives for farmers to grow corn and only corn.  They even offered subsidies and payback loans for farmers who grew corn, paying the most to the highest yielding farms.  And so the corn race began in an attempt to satisfy the hunger for beef fueled by corporations realizing the appetites of the American consumer was insatiable.<br /><br /> Corn is used for feed on CAFOs or Confined Animal Feeding Operations.  CAFOs are where thousands of beef cattle are kept in close confinement to cut down on labor costs and promote easy and rapid weight gain in order to increase the slaughter rate (which is about 400 an hour).  But what separates these CAFOs from our wrapped lunch for the family of four patiently waiting in the drive through is nothing less than thousands of miles and veiled, blood stained walls of ignorance.<br /><br /> Pollan offers many other ethical situations to be considered.  The fact that cattle are ruminants and were never created to eat corn is one of them.  The reason that corn was introduced to feed was to increase the animal's fat content which makes for nice \\"marbling\\" of the meat which results in tastier steaks.  Consequently we are convinced that \\"corn fed\\" beef is the best meat there is.  This completely covers up the fact that eating corn produces many medical problems for the steer including acidosis which in a short time can cause the cattle's stomach's to expand with gases killing them with suffocation.<br /><br /> The ethical implications of ignoring the industrial food chain are too numerous to mention.  Of the many ethical issues that one could consider in The Omnivore's Dilemma there were three that stood out to me most prevalent as a Christian Believer.<br /><br />1.  The insatiable and self-centeredness of the American appetite.  I was overwhelmed to read about how American's on average eat one fifth of its meals in the car and one third of all children eat at fast-food outlets everyday.  Super-sized (better to call them over-sized meals) meal portions and pre-packaged foods are creating more waste then ever before.  There is an obesity epidemic like none other and food corporations are the largest corporation in the world.<br /><br /> 2.  The treatment of animals for harvesting.  When Pollan describes the way in which cattle are fed, kept, and then slaughtered was disturbing to me and I began to fully understand why he warns the reader that they would be challenged to change their eating habits after reading this book.  The fact that 400 steer are slaughtered every hour in these industrial slaughter houses is enough cause for concern.  McDonald's has a 5% margin of error for failed kills on the slaughter assembly (better called disassembly line).  What this means is that it is acceptable to the McDonald's corporation if no more than 5% of cattle routed through the assembly line go on to the skinning phase before being properly terminated.  In other words some actually end up skinned alive.  This excludes many other abuses done to cattle, poultry, and pork on these CAFOs.<br /><br />3.  The Better Way.  Pollan describes a better way to live.  As Christians we must consider as our highest calling not only the verbal delivery of the gospel, (which can be done to a fault) but also our handling of what has been given to us.  We are called to live the best we can with what we have been given.  Pollan admits that there is no easy solution to the problems that the industrial food chain has brought to our plate but he does explore a much better way.<br /><br />A Better Way<br /><br /> Genesis 1:28 & 29 tells us that God has given us his creation to use for our enjoyment and the furthering of our humanity.  The principles of stewardship (using what has been given to you in accordance with the guidelines of the giver, in this case God) are extremely important when thinking about the ethical issues presented in The Omnivore's Dilemma.  Jesus also discusses stewardship in Matthew chapter 25.  This is not in direct relation to the earth and eating habits but the principle is presented.  It should then be a consideration of every believer how he or she treats what God has given to them.  The Omnivore's Dilemma offers a much better solution for what many of us take for granted every day.<br /><br /> Evidence from nature and from scripture both give us reasons to delight in diversity.  Jesus was about bringing all men (from every nation) to himself and the gospel call is for anyone who would believe.  Biblical ideas and philosophy center on the receiving of anyone who would believe.  It is the exact opposite of an exclusive environment where only one kind is desired.  The industrial food chain has created a monoculture of agriculture that has left a deep environmental scar on not only the landscape of America but also the way we live our lives.<br /><br /> Michael Pollan finds a better way to do food.  I agree with Pollan that not every issue is easily resolved in regards to the dilemma of the omnivore but it is our responsibility to seek out the better way.  It is unfortunate that this better way comes at a price.  It means that the large corporations of America would not have the profit margins that they currently enjoy.  It would mean that humans would have to reconnect to the ways in which their food is grown and harvested which will cost time and effort.  The better way could mean that we do not eat meat at every meal or find our meals as easily (lazily) available.  It could mean a journey back to the dinner table and the family dinner may take on a renewed face.<br /><br /> In The Omnivore's Dilemma Pollan visits Polyface Farm in Swoope, Virginia.  Polyface Farm is owned an operated by Joel Salatin.  Salatin is a third generation farmer who adopted from his father and grandfather alternative ways of farming.  Polyface Farm consist in a polyculture of many crops, but of all of the crops that Joel would consider himself a farmer of he would choose grass.  Joel is a grass farmer because what Joel sees when he looks on a field of grass is steak, chicken and pork all working together to create the best scenario for farming: best for the ground, best for the animals, and best for humans who consume its produce.<br /><br /> At Polyface Farm there is an environment for farming which encourages and promotes the interconnectedness of humans to their food.  Pollan claims that this interconnectedness has all but vanished due to the arrival of industrial farming.  Evidence of this relationship is seen in the open air slaughter house where anyone can visit and see how chickens are slaughtered, (which is in direct contrast to the closed and unwelcome slaughter houses in the industrial food market) to the way in which Joel and his staff treat all of the animals.  Pollan finds great relief at Polyface and recognizes the environmental impact of such a place actually adds to and improves the health of the land in which it is situated.  This is in stark contrast to the environment of the industrial farm.<br /><br /> Pollan also ventures into the world of hunter-gatherer where he takes to the forest in an effort to find wild game and wild morels.  He finds most of the ingredients he needs for cooking this final meal from his own land or someone else's that he knows.  Pollan recognizes that this meal as well as the meal eaten at Polyface encompass what is sorely lacking in the industrial market:  the experience of knowing, \\"...what it is we're eating, [w]here it came from, [h]ow it found its way to our table, [a]nd what, in true accounting, it really cost.\\"  It is evident from reading The Omnivore's Dilemma that this is not considered by most and the cost is higher than any of us care to know about or for that matter care to pay.<br /><br />So what is for dinner?<br /><br /> There is no easy solution to the problem of the omnivore.  We are by nature able to eat almost anything on the earth albeit avoiding that which is deadly.  We no longer have the dilemma of our past omnivores where the dilemma consisted in differentiating between what foods could kill us or at least make us sick.  But we do have large appetites and lots of people to feed.  There has to be a better way.  We can at least start by exploring what it is that we are putting on our plates, finding out where our meat comes from, and asking what phrases like \\"corn-fed\\" and \\"cage-free\\" really mean.  As Christians we will be held accountable for how we treated what was given to us.  It is clear that God has given us dominion over the created world but this dominion does not imply abuse or neglect.<br /><br /> The Omnivore's Dilemma brings great insight into an issue that most of us will probably never think about.  But if this issue is not explored deeper and by more of us we are inevitably on a track taking us further and further from the source of our food.  The meal-in-a-pill phenomenon is not too far off unless we carefully consider the questions posed in The Omnivore's Dilemma.<br /><br /> The effort to find what is for dinner might take more money and more time but it should be considered.  We cannot consider the call to be good stewards of what God has given us without considering what it is that we are eating.  It is not about boycotting massive food corporations like Cargill and ADM but it is about caring for our families and being concerned for what they eat.  I fully acknowledge that getting away from the industrial food chain in its entirety is almost impossible but there are things we can do to make some change.  The issue of feeding massive cities like New York and Chicago on anything but the industrial food chain is a problem that has no easy answer.  However if we do not consider the industrial status quo we cannot expect the future to be much better.<br /><br />What Michael Pollan presents in The Omnivore's Dilemma are the essential ethical issues that many of us, if we are honest with ourselves, do not want to explore because it could mean a change in our dietary lifestyles.  As Christians we need to know how to wed the principles of scripture concerning stewardship and creation with our responsibility as caretakers of God's created world.  Doing this will help us understand why the omnivore's dilemma is an important issue.<br /><br /> The Omnivore's Dilemma and books like it are challenging and essential.  We need to see a better way and we need to be challenged to think before we act.  There are many world issues and problems that humanitarians need to consider and where the issue of what is for dinner falls on this spectrum is a difficult question.  But it is clear that this issue needs to be addressed.  If we are Christian Believers this issue speaks not only to our world and our culture but to our hearts.  When we consider the cost of what we do and how we act we are taking our faith seriously.  This includes, albeit readily ignored, the daily question of \\"what's for dinner?\\"<br /><br />Scott Herroncovers up the fact that eating corn produces many medical problems for the steer including acidosis which in a short time can cause the cattle's stomach's to expand with gases killing them with suffocation.    <br /> The ethical implications of ignoring the industrial food chain are too numerous to mention.

B000002KOO|4.0|The thing that annoys me most about this album is that is was butchered. <br />On the original UK version 'Underway' lead into 'One Sunny Day'. This track has been shortened and it souns awful. 'One Sunny Day' was Kirwans best contribution to this album and it isn't here!. There was no need to have 'O'h Well' on this album becuase it was on the 'Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits' album (the red one) where it belonged. The least they could have done was to remove the overlap, it sounds bad. Then there's Madge. What can I say? I would like to search for the person who butchered this album and fight him or her. It would make me feel much better. Then, there's the sound quality... The original album (I have two vinyl copies - with different album covers) is one of my favourite ablums of all time and it grieves me to give it four stars. <br />For Peter Green fans, check out the brilliant \\"End Of The Game\\".
0753820250|4.0|By all means, the book is well written, and I do not regret having read it. However,I think the book has flaws. Perhaps the beginning and the ideas made me expect too much. Maybe also the author had intended too much with this book (it is actually very ambitious). There are the elements of gothic horror and mystery with the concepts of the Library of Lost Books and of the stranger destroying all copies of the mysterious book The Shadow of the Wind. There I could feel the influences of Borges and Lovecraft, and of Robert Chambers's The King in Yellow. It is also a coming of age story of the narrator a la Palliser's The Quincunx. There are also the backdrops of the Franco dictatorship and of life in bohemian Paris.<br /><br />This book appears to attempt a lot. In the end, it looks like the author got overwhelmed, just wanted to finish the book, and turned it into a romance.<br /><br />That said, the book is good, but don't get too excited over the promises made in the beginning. This book does not give any worldshattering revelations a la Borges, or a comment on reality a la Lovecraft, or horror a la Chambers, or a poignant comment on maturing in a dictatorship a la Closely Obseved Trains. It is a well crefted romance.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|What a lovely surprise this movie was! I should have expected as much from the always wonderful Emma Thompson, but Will Ferrell was equally appealing. This unusual story about a man who discovers he is a character in a novel being written by the Emma Thompson character was sweet, tender and dare I say, heartwarming. Love Maggie Gyllenhaal too. Overall a great cast, a nicely written story, and especially a welcome break from the all too stupid, too violent, too vulgar, and/or too inane stories we see in film today. Really enjoyed it.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I am a musician and a Buble fan for sure, and appreciate the resurgence of my favorite kind of music. But this CD for me lacks the polish, the layers and the richness that I look for in truly exceptional recordings. It's good of course, because he's so talented. But I find him indulging himself a little bit too much. I want artists to be true to the composer and the essence of the music, not preoccupied with their own vocal ability, and that's the sense I got. Sure that lick or that phrase sounded nice, but is it the best you could come up with if you tried it a few different ways? Did it communicate that thought/feeling the best it could? He could use a few lessons with a diction coach as well. Ha! Miss Picky.  Still, 4 stars.

B000002P5W|5.0|When I first heard snatches of \\"Are You Experienced\\", Hendrix' first album on Philly's premier, local, underground FM rock station of the time, I couldn't believe that here was a black, American expatriate, living in England, producing what had to be ARCHE-typical California psychedelic hard rock/funk like no other person before or after him! There was a confidence in Hendrix' singing/songwriting and guitar playing that NO ONE has equaled...white, black, hispanic or otherwise, since! Though he played sideman to people like Little Richard and James Brown, he was a better musician than ten of those two put together, though their influence on him was obvious. Here was a man who took three idioms: soul/R&B, rock and psychedelia, and melded them together in a unique consumme that no one has been able to duplicate, though Cream and Arthur Lee's Love came closer than most.<br /><br />\\"Axis\\" is a little more introspective than \\"AYE\\"...it's like Jimi was telling us: \\"Here I am, at least now...whaddya think?\\" You hear his feelings about relationships in songs like \\"Little Miss Lover\\", \\"Little Wing\\", \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" and \\"You Got Me Floatin'\\". You hear his contemplations on spirituality and sci-fi in \\"EXP\\", \\"Bold As Love\\" and \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" and social musings in \\"If 6 Was 9\\".<br /><br />His arrangements were original, forceful, cocky and catchy. There was nobody else like Jimi Hendrix...anywhere! And it's a shame we lost him so soon after he hit it big...in fact, like so many OTHER rockers from the Woodstock era, becoming a legend by the time his second album, this one, had come out!<br /><br />In one year's span of time, we lost Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Mama Cass Elliott and Janis Joplin...! Now Joplin, as far as I'M concerned, was no great loss, though by no means am I glad she's dead, but Hendrix and Morrison were truly stellar talents that made the world of art and music poorer with their passing. There were TONS more talented female rock singers than Joplin out there and she was the first to admit it, (Mama Cass being one of them!) But Hendrix, perhaps the greatest black crossover artist ever, and Morrison...the musical reincarnation of William Blake himself, THEY left a gaping hole where some truly great music had been!<br /><br />Maybe if somebody can perfect cloning before their DNA rots TOO thoroughly....e first to admit it, (Mama Cass being one of them!) But Hendrix, perhaps the greatest black crossover artist ever, and Morrison...the musical reincarnation of William Blake himself, THEY left a gaping hole where some truly great music had been!

B00005JPOE|5.0|History.  Overcoming discouragement.  Looking at something besides the American point of view.  Living your faith.  And real romance.  And all this is accentuated by good acting, accurate period costumes, and beautiful scenery -- NOT dependent upon blatant sex, violence, and vulgarity.  The plot's twists are amazing because they are real, not drawn out of a hat.  The people are unique because they actually were unique individuals, not because a skilled casting director got actors with different personalities.  Worth seeing repeatedly.

B000MGUZM0|3.0|It's interesting how varied opinions of an album/book/etc. can be.  I have spun this CD 5 times now.  I really want to like it, but it's just not as inspired or genuine as Funeral.  It sounds to me like the band had to strike while the iron was hot, and get a second CD out while the getting was good.  There are a few good cuts, I'll use them in compilations.  But as a whole the CD doesn't have the consistency and quality of Funeral.  Just my opinion.

1582701709|1.0|Ok, Wallace Wattles' book is available for free online, Jack Canfield's Success Principles is much, much better and meatier, and this book, The Secret, is redundant, making it boring, long-winded and an utter waste of precious time.  Another reviewer has mentioned hard work, education and money as methods to getting ahead and I agree.  If you've watched \\"What the Bleep\\", this book is that, only watered down.  It's as if she did a google search for the words, \\"...the secret...\\" and extrapolated every instance where one guru or another used the term and then she expanded it into a hardcover book.  This is the most mediocre form of some really cool thinking in areas of psychology and quantum physics and name-it-and-claim-it religion I've seen, but without any of the actual studies or faith to back it up.  Read Jack Canfield, Wallace Wattles, Robert Persig, Napoleon Hill, Brian Tracy, Shakti Gawain, the Bible, hec folks, read *anything* other that this lovely to look at, yet shallow-to-its-spine package.  If I can say one good thing about this: it's good for \\"sound bite\\" sort of reading: keep it in the bathroom for a quick snack of some more widely interesting authors.  The fact that this has been so successful tells me how starved we are as a society to grasp onto anything that floats by in order to feel better about the state of ourselves, our nation and world.

B00003CXB7|5.0|I just love, love, love this film. It's been one of my favorites since the early 1990's when I snagged it off cable on video tape. This 5 start DVD collection is tops in that not only is the transfer of the film fantastic, but the special features within are fantastic too. I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary on the making of MASH and how they had to go to great lengths to keep their vision of the movie intact and they succeeded handsomely IMO. <br /> <br />One of my favorite scenes is when they raise the walls of the showers while Major Hot Lips Hoolihan was inside and she falls and her outburst afterwords is just priceless, also the scene before that where she makes out to Major Burns and it gets broadcast all over the camp, also a priceless scene. <br /> <br />True, the film is based on the book of the same name, but about the Korean War and MASH the movie, is as much about Vietnam as it was about Korea as far as the war is concerned. I love the grittiness of the film, the overlapping dialogue and such, all ground breaking stuff back in 1969-1970. <br /> <br />Overall, this deluxe DVD package is well worth the price for what it contains. <br /> <br />

B000053VAZ|4.0|\\"Benny and Joon\\" is a great film for fans of romantic comedy looking for something different. This movie is different. Very different. <br /> <br />Benny is a car mechanic who has been looking after his mentally ill sister Joon since their parents died. Benny has tried hiring housekeepers to look after Joon, but they all quit in frustration. Benny cannot bring himself to start a relationship, for fear of how Joon will take it, though the viewer gets the impression that he may be using his sister as a crutch to avoid a relationship. Anyway, during a high-stakes poker game between Joon and some of Benny's friends, she loses, with the stakes being that the eccentric Sam must live with them. As it turns out, Sam, with Keaton-esque antics and eccentric nature, is just the housekeeper that Joon has been looking for, and they fall in love. <br /> <br />Don't be expecting a realistic solution to mental illness, because it's not here. Furthermore, I thought that the resolution of the rifts between Benny and his love interest and Sam & Joon was a little too easy. Nonetheless, the movie feels like a fairy tale, and if you just sit back and allow yourself to enjoy it, it's definitely worthwhile.

0446677450|2.0|I doubt I can write anything that has not been said before but this is not a book on how to make money but only about making money. In other words: <br /> <br />But after reading this book it became clear to me that for some people the quickest way to get rich is to write books about how-to-get rich in real estate as opposed to actually investing in real estate. <br /> <br />There is value in the book. However when you come to the realization that the vast majority of the author's current financial position has been built upon the foundation of the Rich Dad franchise and it's subsequent success, you must ask yourself if there is more money to be made in following the principles outlined in the book, or in writing about them. <br /> <br />In summary, this book is all about a man who allegedly used his \\"Rich Dads\\" methods for years and only ended up bankrupt. He then wrote a book which became a bestseller, and the rest is history. Kiyosaki is rich now, but what he has written in this book, and stated on TV, proves that the methods in his book are not the path he took, as Rich Dads methods left him destitute. <br /> <br />I've seen Bob's name in enough promotional articles for Quixtar (pronounced Amway :), that I'm personally convinced as to where he makes his money: the \\"motivational tools\\" business. Why don't you write a book on that subject, Bob? <br /> <br />The title should be: Rich Kiyosaki, Poor Gullible Rube With Dreams of Becoming a Millionaire. Hiyosaki makes his money by selling you his books, not by following his own advice. Please, people, snap out of it! <br />

1582701709|4.0|S. J. Bockett's review in part, essentially states, that one must be<br /><br />cautious not to expect too much too soon, as this can cause unnecessary guilt. My rigid, black and white thinking that was established in me growing up in my family has influenced every part of my life. Living life in this manner is like living in a prison. There has been no room for grey area. It's like living in a straight jacket.<br /><br />People that come from similar, familial backgrounds compartmentalize their lives without knowing it. Compartmentalization serves black and white thinking. It's like a pie. Each segment is an aspect of ones life,<br /><br />one's world. When the segments are delineated by hard and fast boundaries, our ablility to flow through life, through the pieces of the pie, calling upon various segments to assist one in negotiating through life's callings, very difficult if not impossible.<br /><br />Furthermore, I recently attended a Church of Religious Science Service at which time I asked about psychotherapy vs. Science of Mind's teachings.<br /><br />The minister agreed that using psychotherapy to deal with repressed feelings is essential as these unconcious blockages can absolutely interfere with progess utilising the principles within the pages of<br /><br />\\"The Secret.\\"<br /><br />There must be a jumping off point however, when applying \\"The Secret\\" to my life becomes imperative. I believe I have reached that plateau. I must keep in the forefront of my mind, that \\"Practice Makes Perfect.\\"<br /><br />Test the secret. Recieve bonafide proof of the laws of attraction.<br /><br />This does not mean I should not think big. It does mean however, that when I determine what I really want, that it be something I can really<br /><br />believe in and feel.<br /><br />Upon finishing this commentary/review, I will sit down for a while with my copy of the book.<br /><br />My mom often says, \\"There is nothing new under the sun.\\" This is very true of the contents of THE SECRET. The question is... am I..you...<br /><br />applying it?t?

I laughed the hardest when the horn in the VW van starts beeping irratically.  Further when the master of ceremonies asks the little girl who taught her to dance she gives credit to her grandfather.  He asks where he is and she responds, \\"Oh, he's in the trunk of our car!\\"

B000EBD9TY|5.0|The unfiltered primacy of 27-year old Marlon Brando (in only his second film) cuts through the feverish, Baroque-style histrionics that define Tennessee Williams' near-poetic masterwork. Brando's mastery over the characterization of Stanley Kowalski comes from a precocious ability to undercut the testosterone-driven braggadocio with a rough-hewn sensitivity tied to Stanley's need for Stella. Directed on all cylinders by Elia Kazan, the 1951 adaptation of the Broadway hit has a somewhat stage-bound feel since most of the action takes place within the environs of the Kowalskis' downscale apartment building in New Orleans' French Quarter. However, screenwriter Oscar Saul seizes on the sexual themes of Williams' play and brings a refreshingly adult view to them (at least for the early 1950's), as Kazan guides the principal actors to powerhouse performances that demand our attention.<br /><br />The relatively small-scale plot focuses on faded Southern belle Blanche DuBois, who comes to visit her younger sister Stella from Mississippi where she held onto a fantasy of gentility and respectability growing up on the family plantation, Belle Reve. Hoping for a safe haven in New Orleans, Blanche is disappointed to see that Stella has married Stanley, an unruly blue-collar worker. Conflict ensues almost immediately between Blanche and Stanley with Stella stuck in the middle. Gradually, Blanche's self-delusions peel away her sanity until a harrowing incident takes her over the edge. Even though Brando dominates every moment he has, Vivien Leigh affectingly counterpoints with one of her most definitive performances as Blanche, the true protagonist of the piece.<br /><br />Intriguingly, 56 years later, the contrast between Leigh's florid, more ornately theatrical approach and Brando's fearlessly instinctual work comes across almost too extreme with the actress looking all the more pretentious by comparison. Only in the shattering climax do they truly seem on equal ground. The real surprise, especially in the now-unexpurgated version, is Kim Hunter, whose comparatively subtle performance as Stella maintains a delicate balance between supportive sister and lust-driven wife. In a marginally smaller role, Karl Malden is ideally cast as mama's boy Mitch, who gets caught up in Blanche's lies only to be victimized by them. Harry Stradling's evocative cinematography and especially Alex North's jazzy musical score add substantively to the atmosphere of the heady melodrama.<br /><br />The two-disc 2006 DVD set is a treasure trove of extras. Even though it lacks a direct connection with the scenes, the commentary track provides historical context with tracks recorded separately with 94-year old Malden and film scholars Rudy Behlmer and Jeff Young. The first disc also includes a number of trailers for Kazan's classic films, including three just for \\"Streetcar\\". Disc two has an informative 75-minute 1994 documentary on the director, \\"Elia Kazan: A Director's Journey\\" and five featurettes focused on various aspects of the movie - its birth as a Broadway play, its translation to film, the struggles with censorship and the Hayes Office, North's music, and of course, Brando. There are rare outtakes included, though the best surprise is a four-minute screen test Brando did for [[ASIN:B0007US7EO Rebel Without a Cause]].ially in the now-unexpurgated version, is Kim Hunter, whose comparatively subtle performance as Stella maintains a delicate balance between supportive sister and lust-driven wife.

0307263118|5.0|Can a book about death, grieving and isolation from life be sensuous? That, most certainly, was the feeling that this exquisitely written book evoked in me.<br /><br />Imagine strolling through a world famous art gallery and gazing at the paintings, many of which you already know so well from books or lectures. No doubt many of the paintings would have somber, dark themes, yet somehow the beauty of the art overwhelms, bringing forth awe, enthusiasm...even joy. That is the feeling that reading John Banville's Man Booker award winning novel, \\"The Sea,\\" was like for this reader.<br /><br />Max Morden, the narrator, is not an easy character to understand or like. It is precisely his strangeness that keeps us reading. We live in his mind for the entire novel, yet somehow the reader can't quite come to terms with what makes Max the miserable, grieving, self-loathing, isolated man he appears to be.<br /><br />By profession, Max is an art historian, apparently involved in researching and writing a scholarly book on Pierre Bonnard. But he thinks of himself as \\"a man of scant talent and scanter ambition.\\" He is disappointed in life, disappointed in his daughter, and disappointed in himself.<br /><br />After the death of his wife, Anna, Max returns to the only other place in his life where he felt a whole person: The Cedars, a seaside villa run as a boarding house. It was here, as a young boy, that he first experienced love and death. It is the intertwining stories of that time, the recent past, and the present that make up the story line of the novel.<br /><br />Max is a man who dreams that he owns a typewriter without the letter \\"i.\\" He prefers dispassionately to observe life. Banville gives us few glimpses of him actually participating in life. For Max, life passes before him like images on a tableau and people seem to exist for him alone and not in their own right. How odd, therefore, that he views himself as being made real only through people.<br /><br />Max marries his wife because she gave him the chance to fulfill his fantasy of himself. He remembers her with great tenderness. Yet the only time in the novel where Max allows himself to rage against his loss is when you find him thinking: \\"how could you go and leave me like this, floundering in my own foulness, with no one to save me from myself. How could you.\\"<br /><br />Usually, the reader is drawn positively to a protagonist. But with \\"The Sea,\\" the reader is drawn irresistibly to the beauty of the text. The reader falls in love with the words. One novelist, Nabokov, and two poets, Gerard Manley Hopkins and T. S. Eliot, frequently came to my mind while savoring this book.<br /><br />I read a library copy, but when I finished I bought my own copy. I look forward to reading this book again--like revisiting a favorite poem, or reviewing a grand painting, I am sure I will enjoy it completely anew.ax marries his wife because she gave him the chance to fulfill his fantasy of himself.

This reminds me of when Counterparts came out - I liked that as a stand alone CD not compared to old rush. The songs are catchy and deep and the production is fantastic. My ONLY complaint is that there is almost no odd meter which Rush does so tastefully (that's just me). That aside, some new stuff that I liked was the slightly bluesier guitar sounds. In fact the guitar sounds are amazing through out. The bass and drums sound perfect too.  <br /> <br />I have everything Rush ever did and will stick with them until either I or them are through.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|Sin City is definitely not for everyone. If a depressing, violent world with ambigious heroes and crime and corruption isn't your thing, you'll definitely like it even less with Sin City's stylized visuals and heightened gore, sexuality, and skewed morality. For everyone else though, this is definitely one of the more memorable films in recent years, and turns the genre of comic book adaptations into an artform. An all-star ensemble cast is directed by Robert Rodriguez (with Quentin Tarantino!) against a green screen studio set, bringing to life Frank Miller's acclaimed graphic novel series. It's a fantastic mix of the technical and creative, and leaves you wanting more after the film's finished.<br /><br />The recut, extended, unrated, etc. etc. dvd collectors edition is both good and bad. The bad is that recut and extended doesn't really amount to much, and you'll definitely feel cheated if you go in expecting a radically different film (though you can watch all the stories individually now). The good is that like the other Rodriguez dvds, this one's loaded with great bonus features. You know, the kind that's informative, fun to watch, and isn't promotional fluff. Plus the package comes with a digest sized version of \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" so you can compare the film to the source material. A great value.<br /><br />Those who enjoy Sin City (and you can pretty much tell right away from the title if it's your kinda flick) will love this dvd set. Highly recommended.

That's where all the griping from my end comes from, but I also welcome change with open arms, so The Best Damn Thing serves both as a welcomed treat and a piece of pop trash both at the same time.<br /><br />Avril has proven she knows her way around a great song, take a look at Losing Grip, Unwanted, and I'm With You from Let Go. And then we have Take Me Away, How Does It Feel, and Forgotten from the excellent Under My Skin. To deny she has at least SOME talent is foolish, but you wouldn't know it by listening to TBDT. Runaway, When You're Gone, Hot, Innocence, and Keep Holding On are the only songs that can even begin to quench any fan's thirst. Out of those, only When You're Gone, Innocence, and Keep Holding On capture any of the emotion we were greeted with on Under My Skin. The Best Damn Thing is a disappointment...plain and simple.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Runaway, When You're Gone, Hot, Innocence, and Keep Holding On. As harsh as people are being on this CD, I will give it its due. It's extremely catchy and leaves you wanting more when it's finished, so on that front, Avril succeeds tremendously. However, the lack of maturity and focus is just too much to handle at points. I'll remain a fan but you can bet that if she doesn't shape up and put something great out on her next CD that I'm washing my hands clean of her. As for The Best Damn Thing, listen if you want, but you're not gonna miss a lot if you decide to overlook it either.

I prefer the Irish Tenors or the music from LORD OF THE RINGS.....as a farm girl growing up, I had no exposure to Opera ( though I think Tomcat fights around a breeding queen comes pretty close to it).

B000MRA5NS|5.0|Best Bond movie ever. The action is fast paced and not grossly over-exaggerated as in years past. The video quality is excellent and very crisp. Colors are natural and some of the locations look incredible. If you don't own this movie already you should get it.

B00003CY5J|4.0|The score is film with a double reading. On one hand is an electrifying and chilling story of a specialist of first order and a very young newcomer (Edward Norton in an extraordinary performance as the young defiant). This double speech will intermingle in order to convey us one of the most breathtaking movies of this year.<br /><br />You will realize how you can make close affinities with that old cult movie. \\"Cincinnati Kid\\" . This was, on the other hand, the last Op. of Marlon Brando, too.

B0000027I6|5.0|If this was a PF album it would be considered a classic.  The only reason it remains unknown outside the PF fan circle is prolly a matter of distribution.  This album shows off Roger Waters artistically ambitious compositions: songs  that  have great rythmn and forward drive in addition to compelling lyrics. The songs just seem natural and unforced. It is a wonderfully relaxing album to listen to with beautiful textures and great playing. I never tire of it, and it seems as fresh as when it first came out.

Salute to Scott, salute to all the players and artisans!
0743537009|5.0|I'm not really a big Stephen King fan and had never been exposed to his work until I listened to this story. I'm not sure why I decided to check out this book. I think it was because I'd seen bits of the movie and wondered what kind of source material could've produced Jack Nicolson's performance. While it sort of scared me, I found it funny and dumb at the same time. The movie was obviously a showcase for Nicolson. I'd heard people say that the book was so much better and boy are they right. The novel gives the necessary back story and character depth that the movie lacks, legitimizing Jack Torrance's descent into madness while commenting on alcoholism, broken marriages, the silent competition between parents for their child's affections, and a host of other subjects. While the story is still somewhat improbable, it is not funny at all. King makes you believe this really could happen while you're reading or listening to the story, and the story will leave quite an impression on you once you've finished it.  <br /> <br />If you've only seen the movie and rush into the book looking for some kind of immediate payoff, know that there is none; however the pacing of this story is excellent. King starts it off slowly, setting everything up, then just when you think something big is going to happen, nothing does. It almost begins to feel as if you're right there in the Overlook with Wendy, Jack, and Danny, feeling a growing sense of isolation, discontent and anger. You get strung along with just enough foreshadowing to keep things interesting and before you know it the story comes to life with a sudden intensity that doesn't let up. When you've finished it you'll appreciate the plotting of the book all the more. <br /> <br />Campbell Scott does a spectacular job with his narration and really adds something to the story without getting in the way. He isn't over dramatic, giving each character a unique voice, but he lets King's words scare you, his voice just compliments them. He does an especially good job of switching between the insane and rational Jack Torrance, so well that you never can tell when he's going to snap again. Definitely one of the best narrations of an audio book I've ever heard. You'll want to listen to this more than once. Buy it.

B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I loved the first bourne movie and I would have liked this one a lot more if the director hadn't felt the need to shake the camera violently everytime a good action scene was on. You know, it really doesn't help me enjoy the movie when I feel extremly dizzy after a car chase scene. What the hell was this director thinking?. The story was actually pretty good but I just couldn't take the camera shaking. I just hope to god that the director doesn't do the same thing with the third bourne film.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|Awesome boxset, loads of extras, great remastering job and a cool boxset design.  If you want the best fullest versions of the Doors albums here's your set.
B000092T6M|5.0|First of all this movie is a classic. I remember watching it all the time when I was a kid. I'm pissed though because of the way they have released this movie on dvd. First, they put the original version on two sides of the disc, which force the viewer to get up and flip the dvd to finish the movie. Then they make this 2 disc special edition with a whole lot of new scenes that totally didn't need to be in the movie. Plus, they don't even include the original version on the 2 disc special edition. Jesus christ, what does a person have to do to get a great movie decently put on dvd? Is it too much to ask of these movie companies that they show these movies proper respect?
1582701709|3.0|This is a \\"power of positive thinking\\" type of book.  It was very repetitive so it did not hold my interest and I couldn't finish it.  However, all of my friends, and my mother, raved about it so I can't disqualify it and say that you wouldn't find helpful, it just wasn't me. One friend told me it has taken years for you to become who you are and the repetitiveness is needed to counteract all of those years of negativity.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|Exceptional. Uncomparable. Ahead of its time. Even if you hate this kind of polished 70's classic rock, I guarantee these tracks will become stuck in your head after listening to this album.

You will not be disappointed.

B000ILYYJE|4.0|It was a nice afternoon in Dallas on that November day. President Kennedy's motorcade made that fateful turn in front of the Schoolbook Depository building and into Dealy Plaza, and after the cracking of gunfire everything about a world of hope and promise died.<br /><br />To celebrate this moment in history Rhino records and WEA release \\"Perceptions\\" a 12 (6 cd and 6 DVD) set containing all of the studio albums from their self-titled debut to L.A. Woman. Each album has been re-mastered (again) but a new twist has been added. All the recordings have been re-mixed in 5.1 surround sound audio with bonus videos and tracks. Each album is placed in a nice digipack case with a booklet and liner notes with the CD's on the one side and DVD-A discs on the other.<br /><br />If you're looking to upgrade from your vinyl than this is for you. It's a new experience made even more special due to the fact that the first album has been mastered at the correct speed this time as opposed to the hundred other times they could have done it. The 5.1 mixes a little dodgy on the first and second albums in fact \\"Strange Days\\" has some bizarre instrument placement, leveling problems, and the Jim Morrison's \\"moog\\" effected voice on the titled track is missing. This is strange (pardon the pun) due to the fact that this album was recorded on eight track, so mixing options were a little more flexible than the first album but it really doesn't match the feel of the original 2 track mix. But don't worry you have the 2 track mix on the CD side of the slipcase.  As for the first album, it was cut on a 4 track machine so getting a surround mix is pretty much out of the question so the rear speakers have a lot of reverb to give more of a sense of space. Again if you bought the last box set you really do not need this unless you just got to hear these recordings in 5.1 then go right ahead. I bought this because I wanted to upgrade from my 2nd generation CD's.<br /><br />Everything from \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" to \\"L.A. Woman sound pretty good in 5.1 but nothing earth shattering. I still believe that multichannel audio is still in its infancy and too many engineers are basically re-mixing just to show what can be done with 5.1 instead of tailoring a mix that enhances the listening experience without destroying the feel of the original 2 track mix.<br /><br />Overall it is a decent box set albeit a bit pricey. And worth having if your upgrading but if that's not the case, save your money and get something else.or The Sun\\" to \\"L.A. Woman sound pretty good in 5.1 but nothing earth shattering.

B000PMGS8G|4.0|Why, Universal ... WHY?  Granted, this isn't a cinematic classic but it's a good time!  I've loved this movie ever since I was a little kid and was hoping for so much more out of a special edition.  I'm undecided as to whether or not I'll actually purchase this.  I'm fortunate to own one of the OOP copies (stumbled across it in a used CD store for $5 no less) and it seems like Universal isn't giving me a really good reason why I should buy this particular edition. <br /> <br />I gave it four stars simply because I love the movie.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Outstanding uncut, detailed, emotionally filled action submarine classic. If you watched the original movie in the past and enjoyed it, I would highly recommend this full, uncut version of this movie! The only negative issue I saw in the movie, was the special effects, (i.e. model ships/subs) took away somewhat the full impact of the classic 'sub vs ship' hunts. But I guess that is understandable since the movie was filmed circa 1981. Very good submarine movie; recommend using the subtitles option, in order to feel the full experience of the German crew aboard their U-boat!
B000002C1W|5.0|This is one of Pink Floyd's best albums.  The songs are all good, and the sound is very 1980's-synthesizery, which I like.

1582701709|2.0|Yes, I'm all for positive visualization...yes, we can attract negativity by thinking in negative ways, but we cannot get ourselves that car, that house or that job by just thinking you will get it.  It's poppycock.  What really bothers me about this book is that it is marketed in such a way as to make you think that the contents contain THE secret, how dare the author suggest that she has THE secret to happiness, wealth, health, etc.  There is no one secret that can change the world, and to suggest it to people desperate to fix their lives, it's just sad.  Great marketing, but still sad.  She's making a a fortune by quoting over and over these \\"experts\\" who claim to have THE secret to all you could want to have a happy life.  Try doing some charity work...try thinking of others and stop obsessing over your own life and maybe you'll get some satisfaction.  Pick yourself up by your own bootstraps and move forward and leave this book on the bookstore shelf.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.

B00005JPAO|5.0|THE QUEEN is not what I would have suspected to be a great movie, due to its expected docu-stoggy approach and subject matter, but it is -- a great movie. And Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II will forever in my mind be the real queen, she did such a majestic job. The story takes place in the week after Prncess Diana's tragicly premature death in a 1997 Paris automobile crash and leads up to her public funeral. Interspersed with actual news footage of Diana and the grieving crowds, the film goes behind closed doors to look at how the Royal Family and the newly-elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, reacted to these events. Educational as well as entertaining, THE QUEEN is an absorbing study of how families cope in terrible crisis, in this case, the royal and top political families. THE QUEEN also shows how protocol is handled with the Queen and daily life of her household. Fascinating on many levels, THE QUEEN is one of the best films of the last ten years.

B000OMD4BG|5.0|I stumbled upon Elliott Smith a couple of years back and my musical world has not been the same sense.  To say that the majority of his songs are hauntingly exceptional is such an understatement.  I listen to a lot of music, always have, always will.  I try to do the research, I read up, I investigate, I look around, I keep my ears and mind open for new stuff.  And yet throughout the deserted island side of my musical library, that includes:  <br />The BAND, Hendrix, SPOON, White Stripes, Arctic Monkeys, Pantera, Soundgarden, Jim Croce, My Morning Jacket, Cream, Nick Drake, The Beatles, Metallica, Otis Redding, etc.--- Elliott is set apart as something special.  I can't necessarily pin point what it is: maybe it is his soft, wispy voice, that in all recordings, especially live shows, is enveloped by such a stark vulnerability and reality of emotions, anger-- despair--etc.  Maybe it is the realism in his songs-- I don't know.  But I believe that he is the most distinct and valuable melody maker/songwriter of the last twenty years. <br /> <br />This latest release demands five stars and more because of the fact that the songs that didn't make the cut for his earlier albums are sufficient to eclipse the work of anybody going today.  His 'throwaways', his discarded tracks that just didn't make the final structure of an album are  far better than everything else out there. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br /> <br />High Times-- if this doesn't move you-- nothing will. <br /> <br />Talking to Mary-- great track, I have had this recording for awhile from the Trash Treasury-- but it demands an honorable mention. <br /> <br />Miss Misery- this is certainly the earliest version I have heard, with yet unchanged lyrics, not complete or polished but still breathtaking.  There is a version on just piano out there somewhere that everyone should have as well. <br /> <br />Thirteen-- this Big Star cover is always worthwhile-- there is an exceptional live version of this at the 'internetlive music archive'-- which has several worthwhile Elliott Shows on there-- download the 'Black Cat' show from 98'-- all Elliott- all acoustic-- all incredible. <br /> <br />Everything else on this release is just another addition to those songs that a true fan of Elliott now cannot live without.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Please understand that this is not the theatrical film, I thought that movie was good but forgettable. This film is radically different. The director took a film that was good/ok theatrically and made it into one of my favorite films. This cut adds to the plot and many characters. For instance did you know the monk at the beginning of the film that cut the head off of Balian's (Orlando Bloom) wife was actually his brother? These details add layers upon a film that was found wanting leaving a fill that is quite compelling.

B000063K2W|5.0|The dialogue in this flim is still fresh, the actors were the creme the creme of Hollywood. One of my favorite quotes is by Paulette Goddard, \\"Any ladle that dishes out some gravy is sweet\\". Everyone in the film is gone now, but they left an impression that will last a long long time.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I liked the album, is a good piece in it's complete package, but as a Rush fan since I was a little kid, it missed that certain something that makes it feel like a Rush albu, that records like Power Windows, Counterparts, Grace Under Pressure or even Vapor Trails  had, that something that upon listening to any track you know at the first second that it is Rush. <br /> <br />Again, I liked It very much, but it felt just as a good album from any other band, besides Rush, with the exception of the first track. <br />
B00004R9A4|4.0|I watched this for the first time the other day. It was pure fun. Such a great movie, felt like a wonderful escape from the real world. Funny, enjoyable and so original. I loved it, I can't believe I had never watched it!
B000006IUQ|5.0|One of the questions to ask in this hair-raising movie is who is actually the most dangerous.....the bear or Robert Green.  As frightening as it is, at least the bear is open in his aggressiveness and violence....Green is sneaky and deceitful. He leads you to believe he really is a friend to Charles...Another question to ask is why didn't he bury Stephen's bloody pant leg like Charles had asked him to?  He wanted the bear to kill Stephen.....so there would be no witness when it came time for Green to kill Charles.  He probably also thought that in killing Stephen, the bear then, would leave  Charles and himself alone.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Babel is a decent film but after viewing it I was surprised it received the critical acclaim it did. I am guessing the star-power presence of Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt had a lot to do with that. Babel is an often flat film without gripping moments or strong subplots. It tells the story of the interconnectedness (a la Short Cuts, Crash, Pulp Fiction and many others with similarly time-skipping themes) of the lives of four groups of people in far flung locales: rural Morocco, northern Mexico, and the kinetic megapolis of Tokyo. Blanchett's performance as an American tourist critically wounded while on vacation far outshone the supposedly understated but really non-existent acting job turned in by co-star Brad Pitt---here looking both more mature and more stressed-out than I'd ever seen. The most interesting segments of the movie were those that concerned the gentle-hearted Mexican woman who traveled across an international boundary with the young American children she watched for a living, and also that with the deaf-mute Japanese teen who was fiercely seeking identity and recognition, all the while dealing with the aftermath of her mother's suicide. I found Babel almost a letdown considering all I'd expected from it, but I'm glad I did finally get to see it, even if on DVD instead of in theaters.

B000MXPE7Y|4.0|For me this movie was difficult to understand, except at a superficial level, on first viewing.  However, it was attractive enough for me to go back a second time and watch it.  It had many vectors to it that one could follow.  The one that has currently fixed my attention and that i see as the most important, perhaps unintended, most important none the less, is the cause and consequence of early abandonment of <br />children by their fathers due to monetary, business, military or other committments, i.e. distractions from what is ultimately the most protective of a society, service to one's country aside.  Do our small children perceive that we abandoned them when they needed us most and if they do perceive that, whether we intend it or not, what will be the consequences of that perceived abandonment in their lives? <br />  The consequences of Edward Jr's perceived abandonment by his father during the child's earliest years was possible betrayal of his country(because of his seeking out the love and acceptance that he needed), the killing of that sought after love (his wife to be) and the accompanying killing of Edward Sr's unborn grandchild, unacceptable consequences of the \\"call to duty\\" or service to one's country.  What ultimately serves our country best? <br />
0743277457|5.0|Robert Pirsig knows how to pick them.  No surprise there. Waitzkin's book elevates the self help genre with its heartbreaking prose and its clear and precise literary execution.  Not only are the ideas expounded articulately and given delicate care, but they are embedded in an engaging and soulful human story.  This book has Quality!
1582701709|3.0|Simplistic, unsubstantiated and often times self-contradictory i still think there is value to the overall point of the book and the sugestions that are presented. It is obvious that having a positive mental outlook is beneficial in life and helps people get what they want. Does it really work the way the author and her experts claim it does by actually changing the world to fit personal desires? maybe, but that shouldn't be the point.

0440237688|5.0|Katie Wileman <br />Fantasy Genre <br /> <br />Lowry, L. (1993).  The Giver. New York: Random House. <br /> <br />Synopsis: The Giver is a story about Jonas; a young boy who lives in what he considers a normal life until he turns twelve.  Once all students in his community turn twelve they are assigned a job by the elders.  Jonah is selected to be the Receiver of Memories, the most honorable of all jobs.  Jonas quickly learns that the life he once considered normal was in fact choice less and everything and everyone was the same.  The Receiver of Memories job is to hold all the memories of many centuries.  Eventually Jonas discovers what feelings like love, pain, joy and anger really are while the rest of the community are spared of this and live in ignorance.  Jonas also discovers colors, seasons, and having the ability to make choices.  But when Jonah discovers that when someone is released it is not a reason to celebrate because instead of being sent \\"Elsewhere,\\" the person is killed.  At the end of the book Jonahs is so miserable he wants to be released, but instead plans an escape and sends his memories to the community for everyone to experience the memories he holds. <br /> <br />Evaluation: I thought this book was outstanding and beautifully written with an original plot.  Lowry writes in a manner that the reader is convinced that the other members of the community are really clueless to what true feelings like pain and love are, and that they truly live in a choice less, carefully planned world.  In this fantasy book, Lowry writes the community where everything is opposite of real life, as we know.  People don't marry for love, rather the elders match them, and instead of giving birth to their own children there are birthing mothers, and couples must apply for children.  The characters have rigid and proper lives with a strict set of rules everyone must abide by.  Additionally, children are grouped specifically by age and receive certain rules and responsibilities as each year passes.  The community members will never know hunger, or war, or inclement weather because the Elders and Receiver have planned and controlled all of that.  Last, members of the community do not know what choice, colors, or death is.  Lowry writes the story so well that the story and the characters lives sound believable, and the story is logical and consistent throughout. The story ends openly for the readers to decide if Jonas and Gabe will survive.  Between the open ending and the universal truth that this story brings to life give readers many issues to discuss.  For example one universal truth is that every society is plagued with troubles and dangers that the government can't always control because of our rights and freedom.  If the novel was used in a classroom it might provoke students to examine if the rules in our own society should be changed and choice restricted to make the world safer?  Another question an instructor might pose why or why not does the reader believe if Jonas will survive?  <br /> <br />Another book that connects to The Giver, but contain different characters is Gathering Blue which is about a world similar to Jonah's a world of the future but this time the main character is a handicapped orphan named Kira who is spared because of her gifts as a weaver, making her useful to the guardians. <br />
6305678715|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I love Megan Ryan to start with.  Tom Harmon and Sean Connery are also two of my favorite actors. What makes this movie click is the friction between Harmon and Connery and yet, the mutual admiration each has to the other. The plot is excellant as you don't know the outcome until the very end.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.

B000006OAM|5.0|Ophelia is Natalie Merchant's sophomore solo CD. This recording differs from TigerLily in that the record label had greater control of the content and players than the singer would have liked -- leading to her break with Elektra. It also marks the debut of Graham Maby on Electric Guitar; he later goes on to record Motherland and The House Carpenter's Daughter with Merchant.<br /><br />Pete Yanowitz plays drums on TigerLily and Ophelia but was replaced by Matt Chamberlain on Motherland; Allison Miller subsumed Chamberlain's role on The House Carpenter's Daughter. Similar shifts with Natalie's guitarists -- Graham Maby strumming alongside Craig Ross and Todd Vos -- occur on this album. Guest musicians like Lokua Kanza, Daniel Lanois, and Don & Karen Peris accompany Merchant just this once.<br /><br />Her lush songs on Ophelia received wide radio airplay, including Break Your Heart, Kind & Generous, Life Is Sweet, and a truncated version of the eponymous title track. Her shuffling of musicians after Ophelia's release also marked a turn away from commercialism towards the purely artistic for Merchant -- a move welcomed by fans, but probably not her business managers.<br /><br />Essentially, Merchant's best tracks on Ophelia are the ones where she does more than sing. She prods her wurlitzer on the melodic Frozen Charlotte (Track Four) and introduces discord to the chorus. Michelle Kinney's cello and the singer's piano accompaniment on My Skin (Track Five) also underscore the beauty of Merchant's lyrics. I also enjoyed Jay Brunga's acoustic bass on My Skin.<br /><br />Lanois's aching, bleeding, crying, wounded electric guitar on Thick as Thieves is transformative, appearing in the bridge and twisting the track's conclusion into an entirely different song. Yanowitz offers up delicate drums that back Merchant's smooth voice brilliantly here; her keyboard skills are confident and introspective, in perfect counterpoint to the guitars. Michelle Kinney's cello is difficult to pick out but beautiful to absorb.<br /><br />I thought Effigy (Track Nine) was interesting; I enjoyed Merchant's styling on the hammond and wurlitzer, but found the Tibetan chanting to be overwrought. I likewise thought The Living (Track Ten) was great; I'd love to hear Kid Rock tackle a cover of this song. When They Ring the Golden Bells, a French funeral song from 1887, was a strangely fitting closing number.<br /><br />All of Ophelia's eleven songs were thoughtfully recorded at Talking Dwarf Studios in Little Valley, New York. The orchestral reprise of the title track performed by Fretwork is a bonus track recorded at Air Studios in London, United Kingdom. Overall, this is just a gorgeous album. You can tell Merchant's band invested a sufficient amount of effort, emotion, energy, and feeling into these songs.cult to pick out but beautiful to absorb. <br /> <br />I thought Effigy (Track Nine) was interesting; I enjoyed Merchant's styling on the hammond and wurlitzer, but found the Tibetan chanting to be overwrought.

B000002HHB|5.0|TigerLily (1995) used to be my favorite Natalie Merchant CD -- that is until she released The House Carpenter's Daughter. These records are polar opposites; there's a mellow West Coast pop sensibility underpinning TigerLily, but unmistakable countrified folk frames out The House Carpenter's Daughter. Merchant should try pop music again.<br /><br />In my opinion, San Andreas Fault (Track One) is TigerLily's strongest cut. Miss Merchant's plaintive wail kicks off this languid track -- suggesting steam train whistles of bygone years -- and her glossy voice is backed by percussion, a vibraphone, and dueling guitars (John Holbrook & Matt Henderson.)<br /><br />Gorgeous accompaniment from Barrie Maguire, Jennifer Turner, and Peter Yanowitz infuses Wonder (Track Two) with emotion. If any track here resembles Merchant's work on In My Tribe, I suppose Wonder fills the bill. Natalie warbles about faith, love, and patience, instilling belief in these desired timeless qualities.<br /><br />Emotional songs like River (Track Four) will get to you. This song is about River Phoenix, the young actor who died from a drug overdose on October 31st, 1993. I briefly knew Joaquin Phoenix and River Phoenix in 1980, so I thank Miss Merchant for recording this tribute.<br /><br />River is followed by Carnival (Track Five), which is the single that achieved dominant radio airplay. I loved Adrian Lopez Guevarra's percussion here; I likewise admired Katell Keineg's backing vocals. But I'm still ambivalent about that last snippet of ambient street noise that Natalie's voice recedes into.<br /><br />Lyrically speaking, Cowboy Romance (Track Eight) does the best job of telling a connection story. Maguire, Turner, and Yanowitz enhance Miss Merchant's sensitively lilting and wavering voice, and Jay Unger's maudlin violin is a deftly added touch; this song is primarily about deception, promises made, and promises abandoned.<br /><br />I adore Jealousy (Track Nine), which (in addition to Maguire, Turner, and Yanowitz) includes John Holbrook's noodling on the Electric Guitar and Organ, and Eric Schenkman's adroit strumming. This is Merchant's strongest vocal on TigerLily; I could listen to it repeatedly, savoring the last six words for hours.<br /><br />Lovely numbers like Where I Go (Track Ten) never achieved heavy radio airplay, but it's certainly the most endearing of Merchant's `water as metaphor' efforts. Again, Adrian Lopez Guevarra adds distinct percussion that is perfectly matched to Merchant's gift for verbal phrasing, and Jennifer Turner's plucky Spanish-tinged guitar.<br /><br />You'll also be blown away by Natalie Merchant's sanguine confessional Seven Years (Track Eleven), which calmly mimics Sinead O'Connor's piercing Nothing Compares 2 U. In this song the chanteuse speaks of devotion, and of being unable to see past a lover, while Michelle Kinney's low-pitched cello labors away dirge like.<br /><br />Personal Aside: \\"Who ever thought the quiet girl in sixth grade would become a stunning singer known around the globe?

It does stray a bit from the main theme of her other books.  Meaning, the many characters she usually utilizes are almost non-existent in this installment.  I personally found her descriptions of Heaven and Hell quite beautiful and easy to picture and her fictional ideas to how Earth came about, I found especially interesting.

B00005IC2H|5.0|Probably the most emotion filled and aesthetically pleasing album of the last decade. Personally I feel its the best album made in recent years, definately the best album thats more instrumental than lyrical(I say this, because the lyrics although clever and good are somewhat minimalistic along with Jonsi's voice usually being used as more of an instrument than a way to convey words.) I would recommend this to pretty much anyone. Put it on loud, lay down....possibly alter your state of consciousness and enjoy.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|With the latest installment of the Bond saga, the entire series has been recreated in a new image that is more gritty, edgy and realistic. The facelift was beyond necessary as the series had become little more than a cheesy practice of stringing together enough bland action scenes and corny 1-liners to fill 2 hours of screen time. <br /> <br />Daniel Craig's performance totally redefines Bond making him one tough customer but far less cartoony than prior incarnations. He's more interested in getting the job done and less concerned w/ being debonair. Another interesting note, he has character flaws, some of them major. At times his decisions are questionable or clouded by his ego. However he's clearly more of a man than any prior Bond that came before. <br /> <br />There are enough other reviews to give you details about the story so I'll avoid that. I'll just end by saying the story is very good as is the action, the acting excellent all around and the combination of all of those things makes for the best Bond in many, many years. For those hi-def gurus out there, CR is about as perfect as it gets both for picture quality and audio. Altogether well done.

0552998087|2.0|I snatched this up after thoroughly enjoying \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\", but this book has forever put me off of anything else Mr. Bryson will ever write.  It's relentlessly arrogant and petty, and overall just extremely tiresome.  For someone who harps on and on about the lack of civility from those he encounters, he doesn't really seem capable of displaying any himself.  Particularly in his encounters with waitresses he comes off as a first class jackass. <br /> <br />If you want a narrow-minded journal of a pathetic anglophile's tour of the US, by all means pick up the book.  Personally I think there are better ways to spend one's time and money.

That said, this is not a bad cd, but it is a bit too mainstream for my taste. To me, Lacuna Coil, Flyleaf, and Otep are all better female-fronted hard-rock bands. So check them out.

No one I know hates this albumn, in fact, one guy in my dorm back in '95, said he thinks this and Tales from Topographic Oceans were the ONLY good Yes albumns.  Unusual?  No.  Topo had a few snoozers in my OP but this one has all the rythym and good style other Yes albumns had with maybe a few lame tracks, but most are good, goose-bummpy uplifting! In partiuclarly, \\"Sighlent Wings of Freedom\\", \\"Release, Release,\\"  And the slower yet hauntingly nocternal bass and key melodies of \\"Onward(through the Night)\\".  Amazon has the tracks miss listed, Track 8 is labled as 9 and 9 is actually the original albumn relase labe belonging to 7(Onward).
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Other than his recent foray into pop culture aka dating Jessica Simpson, John has always been an artist that has inspired my respect. This CD does not disappoint. From start to finish you have the smooth silky smoky vocals and the bluesy twang of a steel guitar. Beautiful, sexy, relaxing jazzy vibe. I love this CD for resting and laying around on a rainy afternoon or cleaning the house and singing along as I go about my day. Even my husband who is anti most of the music I like has been caught singing along. My three kids all love this one too and my teen will be accompanying me to see him on this tour this summer. Kudos to Mr.Mayer hopefully his musical taste continues to be better than his dating sense or perhaps Jessica has more depth than appears on the surface. But hey who can blame him? Besides, this is a review of music which is excellent and not his dating life right? Get the CD if you are a Mayer fan or even sitting on the fence you will love it.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Almost all reviews of Snakes & Arrows start out by noting that it is the first new Rush album in five years. Perhaps this is to convey a sense of high expectations to the reader and it should be explained further. Rush's previous album, entitled \\"Vapor Trails\\" heralded the return of a band which had been plagued by tragedy for several years. While the album was disappointing, their re-emergence was nothing less than triumphant. At the time, Rush was given a pass by many people for turning in poor work. \\"Vapor Trails\\" continued to lack the passion that had in fact been sorely missing from all of Rush's efforts since \\"Roll The Bones\\".<br /><br />If \\"Vapor Trails\\" was sub-par, then the supporting Tour was anything but. As documented on \\"Rush In Rio\\" and later on \\"R30\\", Rush seemed to relearn that their reputation and indeed their missing passion was rooted in their abilities as performers. As one watched either of these live DVD's, it was almost impossible to believe that these were the same individuals who had recently delivered \\"Vapor Trails\\". What Rush desperately needed in its rehabilitation from tragedy was to be performing. The energy of their loyal fans could not help but give Rush the kick in the pants that it so desperately needed.<br /><br />Rush is a band with a fairly strong work ethic. They don't tour for the sake of touring. Their philosophy seems to dictate that a tour is really only mitigated by a preceding studio release. With the exception of their 30th anniversary tour, this has largely been the case. Rush is not a band to rest on its past glories. With two tours and two live recordings at their back, Rush could stand back and smell the roses for a moment. They had emerged from the darkest period of their history, and weathered a poor studio performance to emerge at the top of their form thanks to the fans who patiently stood by them. In return, they now had to live up to the expectations of their fans.<br /><br />Snakes & Arrows does more than live up to the expectations of Rush's fans. In many ways, it blows these expectations to smithereens and sends them into orbit. The responsibility for this can be laid not only at the feet of Rush and their fans, but also some unexpected sources of inspiration. No less than Pink Floyd's David Gilmour offered counsel to guitarist Alex Lifeson which spun the Snakes & Arrows writing in a different direction than Rush had taken in many years. In a brief backstage meeting (a first for both of these guitar icons), Gilmour expounded the wisdom of composing on the acoustic guitar rather than its electric cousin. Inspired by this idea, Lifeson went on to compose all of the guitar tracks acoustically. This is perhaps the most important component to the sound of Snakes & Arrows. For the first time since the heady days of \\"Hemispheres\\" and \\"A Farewell To Kings\\", the acoustic guitar is omnipresent. With the gradual abandonment of keyboards, Rush has sounded thinner over the years, and the acoustic padding gives it back the sweetness that it missed.<br /><br />Neil Peart's poly-rhythmic sensibilities are in full bloom on this album. His tutelage under Freddie Gruber has given Rush the honor of being called the \\"only hard/progressive rock band that can rock and swing at the same time.\\" It seems that Gruber's influence, which was overly dominant on Test For Echo, has been fully assimilated into Peart's playing style.<br /><br />Geddy Lee is back and so is his angry, growling Jazz Bass. Lee continues to walk down the path he started exploring early in his career, elevating the Bass to the position of twin lead/rhythm instrument. He had started along this path in the days of \\"Fly By Night\\", but returned to it on his 2000 solo album \\"My Favorite Headache\\". Long gone are the Steinbergers and Wal basses with their active EQ's and indistinct tones. The Fender has been his mainstay for more than 10 years now.<br /><br />When taken together, these three musicians have forged a new synergy in the same spirit that originally made them great. There is little fear on this record. The trio jump into experimental territory with abandon, and while it sometimes fails, it usually does well. The lack of experimentation on their more recent releases created an almost sterile atmosphere. Rush has thankfully released themselves from that prison.<br /><br />Rush has never created a recording of such complete integration of lyrics and music as Snakes & Arrows. Amongst some fans, the subject matter of the album has created controversy. Given the inspiration of the interesting times under which we live, this certainly cannot be unexpected. Peart is not sidestepping the heavy issues on this album. He is hitting them head on and this is bound to ruffle some feathers.<br /><br />The album is largely populated by superlative tracks. The true standouts are the song \\"Armor And Sword\\" and the instrumental piece \\"The Main Monkey Business\\". \\"Armor And Sword\\" starts out with a Crimson-esque riff which gradually tapers into seamless harmonic resolution. Listening to this is a true treat, as we finally get to hear someone resolve a Frippish riff (he certainly never would have - but bless Robert Fripp anyway.) All the while, Lifeson's acoustic guitar strums in the background. It produces a truly amazing effect.<br /><br />\\"The Main Monkey Business\\" is perhaps Rush's best instrumental since \\"La Villa Strangiato\\". Fans may label this assertion as blasphemy (in many ears, YYZ reigns supreme), but it is not without reason. Unlike many of their other instrumentals, this does not sound like a jam. This is a complicated piece, but maintains an overwhelming sense of joy. Neil Peart claims it took him 3 days to learn it - this is unheard of for a man who is one of the quickest studies in the business.<br /><br />The rest of the album is truly a pleasure to listen to. If the listener has the opportunity, he or she should listen to it in its entirety in order.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|My teenager says she \\"sounds like a baby\\" I love the sweet soft pure vocals on this CD. I originally bought it for the pop standard that was getting all the airplay and found I loved all the other songs just as well. She is alternately achingly vulnerable and fun on several of the songs. They are songs of longing, wishing and hoping for changes that we may never see. A beautiful freshmen debut that deserved all the kudos and hype it received.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer is at the top of his game. Actually, he's at the top of everyone's game. This dude is gifted beyond belief. I don't think anyone on planet Earth comes as close to covering all the bases as well as he does. He combines melodic vocals, intelligent lyrics, and extraordinary musicianship. To top it off, the production and recording quality is absolutely amazing. It's all there, and it's about as close to perfect as you can get. From a guitar player's point of view, the touch, feel, and assortment of delicious guitar tones is truly amazing, and yet he plays with incredible maturity and restraint leaving \\"gobs\\" of room for the songs to \\"breathe\\".  He takes the cliché's \\"less is more\\" and \\"it's not what he plays, but what he doesn't play\\" to a whole new level.  Continuum is definitely my favorite, but Heavier Things and Squares are awesome as well. They are all priced cheap and there's not a bad song to be found on any one of them. Make your ipod happy. Get them all!

0743298020|4.0|The book starts slow - the writing is a bit choppy, but then Setterfield gets into the flow of things, and the story starts to pick up. I really enjoyed it. As one of the reviewers on the back of the book said - this is a book for those who love reading. Us nerdy girls who spent our teenage years curled up in our rooms with Pride & Prejudice and the like. Or is it 'We nerdy girls???' <br />
0743289412|1.0|I'll keep it short and sweet. I am a huge King fan. I was surprised when I saw this book at the store (b/c I didn't even know it was coming out). That said, I bought it right away. Well, bottom line is that it was terrible. The made up words were too much!!!! Bad gunky, bools, sowisa, etc....made me want to dump the book after about 100 pages. Also, I found the storyline to be too similar to the Secret Garden. If you are new to King's work, try the Dark Tower Series, or Talisman and Black Room. They will provide much more bang for your buck.

0156027321|2.0|As far as I know a \\"lifeboat\\" is inflatable, made of rubber, and rarely exceeds the length of two people laid end to end. It took me a while to realise the lifeboat referred to in this book is nothing of the sort, and even then I had no sense of the geography of the boat, what the \\"benches\\" were, where the tiger had been hiding, how the tarp was positioned, which really made following any of the action impossible. A diagram would have helped immensely.  <br />At the beginning of the time on the lifeboat there is said to be about 3 months worth of biscuit rations and canned water, which then seem to immediately not exist after one meal, as he takes to testing drinking bacterial water and eating feces without explanation.  <br />The instances of unusual animal behaviour described at the start of the book are interesting, assuming they're factual. The details of the ordeals faced against the elements while lost at sea also seem like they may have come from research into actual people who have survived in similar situations, a couple of which are even mentioned in the book, so it leaves you wondering how much credit the author should get in putting them into a fictional narrative if all his writing added is the 50% of the content which consists of elaborately drawn out descriptions of the most banal things. What could be a sentence is turned into a paragraph and what could be a paragraph is turned into a chapter.  <br />The part where imagination takes over, the mysterious island, demonstrates creativity not previously found in the book, and hints that the author might be able to write a good sci-fi thriller.  <br />The descriptions of fates of animals are often pointlessly sadistic. Young sharks killed for food are described as \\"pups really\\" seemingly to draw some allusion to helpless baby dogs.  <br />The main drawcard of the bulk of the book seems to be the ingenuity of survival strategies Pi employs, which are less inventive than those depicted in any movie that uses this theme, and like the layout of the lifeboat itself I had no understanding of what Pi was described to be doing with the oars and ropes.  <br />At the end the narrator tells a different version of the story which accounts for the disappearance of the biscuit rations (but not the canned water). So the entire thing is basically a Fight Club derived twist ending where what the reader is seeing is presented as objective reality but later revealed to be the main character's delusional (or in this case embellished) interpretation.  <br />If I didn't know the author was pushing 40 when he wrote this I'd take it's juvenility as the beginnings of a potential great writer.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|I bought this (along with ESB and ROTJ) in order to get the original theatrical versions. I couldn't have cared less about the new and improved most recent altered/special edition versions of the movies. In fact, once I got the original versions, I wanted to throw the special edition disks out, along with other special edition versions of the original trilogy I had accumulated over the years, but my wife wouldn't let me.    I all I can say, is after years of being force fed Lucas revisionist versions of the original trilogy, it was SOOOO refreshing to see unaltered versions.    Now, some of the ultra purists will insist these 'original' versions aren't the REAL originals, but a well done transfer from the laser disks done back in the late 80s or early 90s. I don't know if they are correct. I used to keep up with all this, but I stopped a while back. For those looking to relive the nostalgia of seeing the movies in theaters as kids, it probably won't matter much.  (Anyone who remembers the original Nub-Nub song from the end of Jedi and cried when Lucas replaced it with some new John Williams composition will know what I am talking about.)    In this classic release, Han shoots first! There are no Mos Eisley edits and the classic end battle is complete with original fighters and not those fake looking CGI spacecraft. I loved it all!    After seeing the originals, I realized just how cheezy the CGI additions in the special editions actually were. The original version even contained hairs and dust on the screen from the film capture, so the theater experience is even more authentic!    The original versions are works of art, in a way I feel I should frame them or put them in a safe deposit box. Lucas and company were miracle workers back then, true pioneers.     The special edition disk was pretty much the same as previous special editions, Lucas might have made some changes, who knows? If you are looking to buy this for the special edition content, I'd hold off. Wait for the inevitable Blue-Ray/HD-DVD release in the next couple of years.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Kill it and start at the beginning. <br />The Casino Royale team have finally done it, pulled me out of my Bond boredom with a fresh new script and a fresh new face. Gone is the smirky, smart alecky bugs bunny in a butler suit that was making me roll my eyes in frustration. Instead of campy, toungue in cheek, cast off one liners, we get intelligent dialogue and subtext between Bond and his new leading lady. No large insidious criminal installations blowing up at the end and stupidly baroque torture scenes. We get a bare bones interrogation with wicked humor and a journey that turns a cold man colder. <br /> <br />Not perfect, but I was quite surprised and Daniel Craig has a fascinating face and presence.

Utterly unique and one of rock & roll's brilliant defining moments.<br /><br />God save the Queen.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|...it will stifle an artists creativity. RUSH has been headed in this excellent direction since 1989 with\\" Presto\\". That's almost 20 years ago, when they began putting a stronger emphasis on a \\"body of songs\\" instead of longer pieces. If you listen to the subsequent albums since 1989 and possibly since 1983 with \\"Signals\\". There is a cohesiveness, a theme to the work as an album. This album is a sonicly powerful modern statement from an incredibly gifted band. I feel the production helps bring the impact through. I have been a fan of RUSH since 1976. I was 11 and my brother came home with \\"All The World's A Stage\\". I had never heard them prior to that.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed the slow burn of the impact of their albums. Every one of them. My advice would be to keep the CD nearby. Very close. Listen over and over until you gain a familiarity with the songs in order of appearance. These are great songs and the melody, lyrics and musicianship is pure, intellegent and on the mark. Stir and sip slowly. Oh yeah, turn up the volume!
B000002UD0|4.0|I absolutely love this CD. Not for the sole fact that it is John Lennon's, but for the music itself. This has to be one of my favorite CD's by him. The Song \\"surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)\\" is one of the greatest songs on the album. I highly recommend this CD.
0803730470|5.0|I cant recommend this book enough.  It is truly the best children's book I have read to my two and a half year old son. <br /> <br />The story is wonderful.  The phrasing and rhythm of the dialog is fantastic and what really sets it apart form other children's books is the cunning nature of the story. <br /> <br />The illustrations are great as well. <br /> <br />My only disappointment is that the author or publisher decided to change some of the text when the second edition was published.  Which in my opinion took away some of the charm.  I am still trying to find a copy of the book with the original text but can only find the book with the revised dialog.  In the mean time I simply read it to my son using the original dialog from memory. <br /> <br />Overall a wonderful book!!
B000002JSP|4.0|In the wake of punk and disco, Led Zeppelin in 1979 must have looked very old.  For what would end up being their last album, \\"In Through the Out Door\\", the band responded by embracing synthesizers and new sounds.  This may have had more to do with the dominant voice on the record being bassist John Paul Jones rather than guitarist Jimmy Page, who was absent for large portions of the sessions, but under Jones' guidance, the band produced perhaps their most unique album. <br /> <br />This change in sound is apparent from the outset-- the churning, ambient noise intro of \\"In the Evening\\" signals the change before cascading in a descending, sweeping dramatic riff that recalls the best of \\"Physical Graffiti\\".  Topping off a great fierce vocal by Robert Plant amidst the keyboard swirl is a fantastic, almost blunting solo by Page.  The rest of the record doesn't stick to this path though, exploring everything from a feature for Jones' boogie piano (the superb \\"Southbound Saurez\\"), an electric rock take on country and western (the highly entertaining \\"Hot Dog\\") and a couple absolutely fantastic pop songs (the lilting \\"Fool in the Rain\\", with a fuzz soaked solo from Page, the tender, synth-string driven power ballad \\"All My Love\\").  Along the way, there's even an extended cut (\\"Carouselambra\\"), that while it's long and melodramatic, manages to hold interest and a great blues closer (\\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\"). <br /> <br />\\"In Through the Out Door\\" is probably not for everybody, it's a very different Led Zeppelin, but I've often thought it was among the best work they've ever done.  Highly recommended.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|!Lavoro eccellente Michael di musica e di canto! My favorite is Everything...its very different in its sound. Many good songs...many he has put his own into them. I can see him in my mind him on stage singing. I've seen him him in video clips on the internet too. He has lot of personality and charm which filters into his music. A few people have mentioned a \\"lisp\\" I guess I will have to listen more closely. I think I will get the CD with the 14 songs, I think its worth the extra money.<br /><br />Everybody has said enough about this CD and I can't think of a blame thing I can add to everyone elses comments. I think the best deals are right here at Amazon.
B000002JSJ|2.0|Judging by its followup, I'm not the only one who felt that \\"Physical Graffiti\\" was a bit overblown and self-indulgent, apparently Led Zeppelin did too.  It's next album was as close as the band would ever come to a stripped down approach, eschewing the keyboards and grand arrangements for electric guitar driven, riff-based rock.  In principle, I'm a fan-- nothing like shedding all that extra weight, but in practice, \\"Presence\\" works out to be surprisingly pedestrian and likely the weakest album in the band's catalog.<br /><br />It's not that anything on here is particularly bad-- it's just that the songs lack anything exciting or distinguishing about them-- they've all got that \\"album track\\" feel.  The lack of texture generates a sameness to the album, further accentuated by vocalist Robert Plant sitting in a more comfortable middle register for the entire record.  It drifts from one unmemorable riff-based slice (\\"For Your Life\\") to another (the sluggish blues \\"Tea For One\\"), with the occasional interlude provided by embracing '50s style rock 'n' roll (\\"Candy Store Rock\\", and to a lesser extent \\"Hots on For Nowhere\\").  Again, none of it is bad, it's just not terribly exciting.  The exception is opener \\"Achilles Last Stand\\"-- a startlingly concise slice of riff-based rock for a 10 minute performance and the staggering Blind Willie Johnson remake, \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", with its fierce energy and a fine honking harmonica solo.<br /><br />Apparently, I'm not the only one who felt this way about the record-- Zeppelin only performed \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" live.  There's enough good material on here to make it worth having, but this is not among the band's finer moments.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Audrey Hepburn at her best and brings back a feeling of New York that doesn't exists anymore..
B000002JSR|2.0|Released two years after the band's breakup, \\"Coda\\" is a collection of leftovers from Led Zeppelin's career.  Fair warning, I tend to hate these kinds of compilations-- most of the time the stuff left in the bucket was left there for a reason, and while demos can be interesting to hear, they're usually of limited value.  This record collects two tracks recorded live in 1970 and subsequently overdubbed (\\"We're Gonna Groove\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\"), one leftover each from \\"Led Zeppelin 3\\" (\\"Poor Tom\\") and \\"Houses of the Holy\\" (\\"Walter's Walk\\"), no less than three from \\"In Through the Out Door\\" (\\"Ozone Baby\\", \\"Darlene\\" and \\"Wearing and Tearing\\") and a drum feature by John Bonham with subsequent overdubs by Page (\\"Bonzo's Montreaux\\").<br /><br />\\"Coda\\" pretty much lives up to my previous comments-- nothing here is awful, \\"Poor Tom\\" has a nice chug to it, \\"Darlene\\", while in serious need of lyrical development, has a decent riff, but by and large it moves from one unmemorable piece (\\"We're Gonna Groove\\") to another (\\"Ozone Baby\\").  The only real (and quite noteworthy at that) is \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\"-- a downright explosive performance, guitarist Jimmy Page provides response to vocalist Robert Plant's call over a nice blues groove before cutting loose into one of his fiercest solos on record.  But one track doesn't do much to resurrect an album, and this one is pretty much for collector's only.

B000002KMV|5.0|As an old school Prince fan from back in the day, I bought this \\"album\\" in vinyl form back in 1981.  As any true Prince fan knows, there was a real treat inside the album cover!

He is a true Prince.  <br /> <br />My favorites:  Controversy, Do Me, Private Joy and Jack U Off.

B000NVIXFK|2.0|Rush is my second favorite band (after Gentle Giant) and I like every album they have made.  One of the things that really sets Rush apart is their ability evolve their sound from album to album and in some cases, totally reinvent their sound but yet at the same time, still write good music (most bands who try this end up sucking).  While I consider their music from the 70's and 80's to be far superior to their modern stuff (which I consider to be from Presto to the present), their modern stuff is still very good for the most part.  Their modern music differs from their older music in that it is generally simpler, less dynamic, more layered, more guitar-driven, the bass is less influential, and the keyboards are considerably less influential (and in the most recent modern stuff, completely absent).  With all of this said, Rush is still creative enough even with this modern approach to be able to write some very good music. <br /> <br />Snakes And Arrows definitely fits in with their modern era.  However, I consider it worse than any of their other modern albums and therefore their worst album.  Why?  Well, first of all, it basically sounds like Vapor Trails, Test For Echo, Counterparts (my former least favorite Rush album), and Presto mixed together and recycled.  There really is nothing (significant) new musically here.  The new stuff that they do add is finding ways to water down and neuter their most recent past music (which did not need watering down or neutering).  The lyrics are also the most narrowly focused, most depressing from beginning to end, and least sublime of all of their albums. <br /> <br />Far Cry, Armor and Sword, and Workin' Them Angels all sound like songs from Vapor Trails with Far Cry being on par with the better songs of Vapor Trails (and being the best song on this album) and Armor and Sword and Workin' Them Angels being near the bottom of a typical Vapor Trails quality song although not bad.  With this said, Armor and Sword is a bit interesting in that the verses sound like something from Vapor Trails whereas the chorus sounds like something from Presto.  It is a bit disjointed but not bad.  The Larger Bowl sounds like something from Presto and is decent.  Spindrift sounds like something from Counterparts and sucks (for lack of a better term).  It is very dissonant but yet lacks any of the qualities that makes a good dissonant song good.  The Main Monkey Business sounds like an instrumental from Counterparts (with perhaps a slight touch of Roll The Bones) and I consider it the best instrumental of the album.  The Way the Wind blows is perhaps the one song that I can't say which past album it sounds like it is from (perhaps Presto a bit).  That does not mean that it is a good song, though - in fact, I consider it the second worst.  As the name suggests, the song totally lacks focus.  Hope is a short, inoffensive instrumental that neither helps nor hurts the album as a whole.  Faithless is the worst Rush song ever written.  It basically has a slight Test For Echo sound but is ten times worse than anything from that album.  Imagine the worst aspects of Test For Echo and Counterparts combined and multiply it many times.  I would have given the album three stars if it were not for this one song (yes, it is that bad).  When I listen to the album now (which I have been doing every day since I bought it on the day it was released), I now skip this song.  The album would have been much better off with one less song (this one).  Bravest Face is significantly better and has very much of a Presto sound to it.  I consider it the second best song from the album after Far Cry.  Good News First is a bit difficult to categorize (like The Way the Wind Blows) but I think it has a mix of a Counterparts sound with a Presto sound (and a bit of Test For Echo).  It is ok, I guess, but somewhat disjointed.  Malignant Narcissism sounds like an instrumental from Test For Echo and is good.  We Hold On sounds like something fromVapor Trails with a bit of Presto thrown in.  It is a good song and in my opinion, the third best of the album.  I would much rather just review each of these songs on their own merits but hey, I can't help it that they sound to me so much like their recent past albums.  <br /> <br />While this may be my least favorite Rush album, if you are a Rush fan like me, it is still worth buying.  After all, it is Rush :) .  If you are a big fan of their newer music, you will definitely like this album a lot.
B000002N1E|5.0|When I first heard all the chaos surrounding the Warner thing, I was worried it would affect him and the music.  What was I thinking?!  The man can't be stopped!  Gold is one of his most original albums.  I love the NPG Operator, he is so innovative and does not hesitate to try something outlandish and new.  He has no fear when it comes to the creativity of his music. I was lucky enough to get a copy of a rare live version of Endorphine Machine, it was even more funky than the CD version!  Eye Hate U is my favorite on this album and is currently pumping in my CD player right now. He always knows the right things to say.  Everything he touches turns to GOLD!  \\"Right now I hate you so much I wanna make love until you see...\\"

Takes a very honest look at the dynamics of high school life including crushes, friendships, peer pressure and many other issues that all kids face at one point or another.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who said that you shouldn't review the album until you've heard the whole thing. So I'm not going to review the music, but this is a review of the album.    This is from the Web site announcing the vinyl release:     \\"The original analog master tapes were driven out to Acous Tech Mastering in Camarillo, CA. where the legendary vinyl mastering team of Kevin Gray and Steve Hoffman cut Stadium Arcadium across 8 sides. The first step was to get the incredible sound on those master tapes transferred on to lacquers and as you will hear that was flawlessly accomplished. Next up was the plating and pressing process where all we had to do was go across the hall to R.T.I. which is known around the world for their high quality vinyl making.\\"    The vinyl came in two different sets. One, on 180-gram vinyl with a big book and stuff inside for ninety-nine bucks, the other on what they called regular vinyl with no booklet, just four discs for thirty-nine bucks. I got the latter for thirty-six bucks while visiting in Louisville and it is one of the finest packaging jobs I've ever seen for any record. It's almost stately, especially for a rock album. If the vinyl in the package I bought is inferior, they fooled me. It weighs a ton and is gorgeous.   People complaining about the mastering on the CD ought to, because the disc is a typical modern compression disaster. The vinyl is completely different.     From Wikipedia: \\"Similar to Californication, Vlado Meller's mastering of Stadium Arcadium features a heavy use of audio compression. However, the vinyl versions of Stadium Arcadium have been mastered by Steve Hoffman and Kevin Gray at AcousTech from the 30 ips analog master tapes,[5] \\"the mixes are all powerful, very dynamic, tuneful, exciting and quite high fidelity sounding.\\"    I've played one record, both sides, so far, and I just wanted to come on and let people know that the production is incredible. I thank my lucky stars I didn't abandon vinyl for CD(I have a nice CD player) or, gasp, iPod. The new generation coming in that doesn't care about fidelity in music is just a wave of tone-deaf dummies, as far as I'm concerned. I'm not an audio snob, but I want my music to sound great and have wanted it to ever since the old high school days when we'd go to the person's house with the best stereo to cue up the Yes and Genesis and all that. It's supposed to sound great. On Vinyl, Stadium Arcadium does. For the best selling album of 2006, why settle for less? Go buy a record player, folks, and find out what you've been missing, or forgot. I would love if someone posted here why they don't care about the quality of the production when listening to music they purport to love . . .

I was very pleased with the service and the prompt delivery.  The album is every bit as good as I remember from my youth.  Now my son is hooked on Bon Jovi as well!

It is often times too hard to find happiness in this line of work and all someone really needs is to be loved and to have support.  This is a great title to add to anyones collection, also a good date movie.

0784011176|1.0|I first saw this movie around 1994.  Generally, I love moody, period pieces, but I disliked this film initially and disliked it again when I decided to give it a second try in 2007.   <br /> <br />I find the film pretentious and offputting.  The only semi-sympathetic character is Sam Neill's.  And I find the notion of non-con sex that blossoms into \\"love\\" not only disturbing but repugnant.  My daughter watched it with me this time and as soon as the piano lessons began, she commented:  \\"I'm officially checking out.\\"
B000B5IPDI|5.0|Tim Burton's return to genuine film making is a welcome endeavor indeed. Here he creates a film that reminds me of what great film making is all about: fantasy, love and reflecting on the human spirit. I scoffed at a review that compared Big Fish to The Wizard of Oz when Big Fish first came out, but upon viewing it the comparison is really not hyperbolic at all and is actually quite justified. There is a unique carelessness and an innocence that resides perfectly and constantly in both films. To me, both films are truly a breath of fresh air and hope.<br /><br />Big Fish is a book written by Daniel Wallace and is the delightful story of Edward Bloom, who has reached the twilight of his life and surrounds himself with his son, daughter-in-law and his wonderful wife Sandra. Eddie has seemingly lived a fantastic life of lies and exaggerations and his son has grown to call his bluff on more than one occasion. In fact, his son returns not just to possibly say good-bye to his father, but to attempt to get him to spill the beans on the truth of who his old man really is. Eddie of course, stands by his stories and brushes off his son's accusations nonchalantly. Most of the film we see Eddie revisit his life as a whole, seen through only his own stories. How he once befriended a 12 foot man; how he arrived in a town that was paradise, once to early and once too late when he turned it back into paradise again; how he joined the circus for three years so he could find out pieces information once a month from Amos the ringmaster about the girl Eddie was sure would be his wife and how Sandra would believe Eddie to be dead in war but he would return. The stories are full of details that would clearly indicate they are false but sometimes they are just better that way. Eddie is a mythological figure and that is just fine with him and as a viewer it's fine with me as well.<br /><br />Eddie is played by Albert Finney who is in turn mirrored by Eddie's youthful version, the outstanding Ewen MacGregor who once again proves his versatility. Jessica Lange plays the older Sandra and she is played as a youngster by the talented Alison Lohman who carries as much energy and beauty as you could expect for a role with so little dialogue and so much importance. She is a real find and makes you fall in love with her right along with Eddie. Helena Bonham Carter brings her talents to the roles of The Witch and Jenny (or all of the other important women in Eddie's life). Steve Buscemi shows up, which is always a pleasant surprise and of course Amos is played by Danny DeVito who is as enjoyable as ever. The flat Keanu Reeves clone Billy Crudup is perhaps the only drawback, but he is a safe casting call as Eddie's son and does what he can in discovering that his father is exactly what he says he is and more.<br /><br />Let me just add that I believe Big Fish is a family film. I don't see why it shouldn't be rated PG rather than PG-13. The language rises above the prime time television level once, there is blood only in a comedic and romantic fight sequence that has a truly admirable message and there is a women's nude rear displayed briefly and non-sexually. This is not grounds for a PG-13 movie. I would bring a seven year old to see this. In fact, my guess is that the movie was directed at this demographic. When content is not exploitative, it is not really inappropriate. I can't see why Rock Diesel films get PG-13ed when the message is nothing short of \\"Kill the bad guys, make a lame joke, drive and crash really cool vehicles and get the dirty chick\\". Anyway, Big Fish may be about a guy who is stretching the truth but the characters' hearts couldn't be more firmly in the right place. The scene when Eddie fills an entire field with Sandra's favorite flower and stands in the middle of the field, outside of her window and calls out to her comes to mind. It brings joy to my heart in a way that only a film like The Wizard of Oz can, and a small child should neverever miss that kind of message. Big Fish is a smart film that really generates a ton of emotion and convincing special effects. I don't doubt for a moment that more work went into the effects than money. This film carried a sense of hope, pride, real love, respect, fantasy and the crucial element that films of these tainted times often forget: natural and unforced optimism.<br /><br />Then there is Tim Burton. He is the filmmaker that can put all of these elements together and for the first time tug at your emotions as well. Two things make this film better than Burton's other work. Firstly, it is real and doesn't dwell on being over-stylized and under-dramatized. Secondly, it is pure, clean and full of moments we can all relate too. Tim Burton has made a film that will alienate his older fans who haven't matured like he has, without \\"selling out\\" (he's done that before) and he has made a film that the whole world can watch, enjoy and discover this unique filmmaker.

0786838655|5.0|Better late than never - am so glad to finally have read this book - from page 1, it is a delightful book - you enjoy seeing the words on the page and enjoy what the story has to say - the plot is great - A young man Percy (Perseus) Jackson, a troubled 12 year old learns that he is the son of an Olympic god! He, for his safety, sent to a summer camp for demi-gods, as they (half-mortal/half god) are called - You know the Greek gods and goddesses, celibacy is not their strong point (with some exceptions - Artemis??) Percy finds friends and finds the identity of his father, and is sent on a quest to avoid a war between the gods. We meet many characters we all know from our mythology books, and like Nightlife of the Gods, Thorne Smith's awesome book, we see more 'human' traits in these gods, making us like them and not trust others.<br />It is one of the most fun books I have read in a while, and for me to read 125 pages in one sitting is the greatest compliment I can give.
0743289684|5.0|Read this book and learn to except that reality is just that, it is reality.  This book gave me a more expanded view of how I view myself when faced with hardships, it also enhanced my appreciation for the concept that when a system works, we work towards a world of harmony. I appreciate the small things much more now and how having some guts and tenacity can go a long way. Ayaan is a brave woman who has been true to herself. Not enough books like this out there girls, lots to learn about ourselves and how our lives are truly a journey.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|No, this album is not [[ASIN:B0002IVN9W Funeral]].  And yes, it isn't as good as that album, either.  However, with Neon Bible the Arcade Fire show that they have one of the most original sounds out there, have not blown their load creatively and prove that they can move beyond what worked before and create something totally new and exciting.  After all, isn't that what great artists do?  Neon Bible is a lot more focused than their previous album - darker, more baroque and more politically charged.  With a larger budget, you can see the results - pipe organs and full orchestras add to their rich, textured sound.  The standout song on the album is Intervention, and it encapsulates the album - rousing and operatic, soaring and inspired, layered and rich without ever overdoing it.  Recommended.

0393327655|1.0|I bought The End Of Faith to read for a book discussion group. I did not expect to agree with the author but the book is much worse than I anticipated. He has no understanding of cause and effect. He does not hesitate to blame people living today for events that happened hundreds, even thousands of years ago. He dodges some of the hard questions by simply asserting that Communism and Fascism are religions too. Everything he dislikes is by his definition a religion. He's right about Islam for the wrong  reasons. And speaking of reason, the key word in the book, he never defines it and I don't believe he knows what it means. You have to wonder why he wrote the book because the philosophical/theological questions he raises are the stuff of late night dormitory arguments. All you can say for sure is that Harris really hates Christians. I would not have finished the book if I had not been under an obligation to the discussion group. And by the way, he ends with a remarkably foggy discussion on how to save the world through \\"contemplation.\\"

0743496728|5.0|In this hauntingly timely novel, Picoult tells the story of a high school shooting, and the story of all of the kids involved....including the shooter.  Peter Houghton has been a victim all of his life; always the kid that didn't fit in.  His best friend Josie accepts Peter for what he is, and doubles from the very beginning as both friend and protector.  But sometime in their middle school days the two part ways...Josie finding it much more palatable to be part of the popular crowd than it was to be Peter's friend.  Life for Peter doesn't change much, however...he is continually abused and humiliated; the only difference is the absence of Josie, his protector and the friend that he loved.  And then one day in high school, after having been bullied by the same group of children virtually his whole life, Peter simply decides that he just can't take it anymore....... <br />In an eloquent literary voice that will make it difficult for readers to decide on the obvious aggressor, Picoult tells a tale that is heartbreaking in its honesty and its ordinariness.  There is something in the way that this author pens a story that simply renders her work completely addictive. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB
B00005JPFF|3.0|\\"Spiderman 3\\" falls victim to a common ailment of most hero movie franchises. If one villain is good, then two would be great, But if two would be great, then three would be fabulous! (Think the horribly overstuffed \\"[[ASIN:0790732912 Batman & Robin]]\\" or \\"Superman III.\\") So while I really enjoyed the third installment in the Spiderman series, I kept getting the feeling that I was watching what would have made two great movies crammed into a single average one.<br /><br />For instance, is Thomas Haden Church's Sandman necessary to this film? Granted he lets the dark Spiderman loose for a bit, but both The New Goblin and Venom get their turns as bad spidey bait. It also sucked points away by convoluting plot points and weakly re-writing the circumstances of Uncle Ben's death. The movie's pace would have significantly improved had the conflicts been more limited to Peter, Harry and Eddie Brock. Since the main focus was on Harry and Peter's attention to Mary Jane and Eddie's anger at losing his girl to Peter, it would have tightened the story if Sandman had been saved for later.<br /><br />The conflict also gives Tobey Maguire a chance to goof around with the role. His moments as Dark Peter Parker are some of the film's funniest (following J.K. Simmons as J. Johah Jameson), and his antics in the jazz-cafe were the ones that got the big reaction in the theater I was watching this. I also found it amusing that when Peter gets bad his bangs suddenly fall down his face and he looks like he should be joining a Fall Out Boy/My Chemical Romance concert.<br /><br />What all this crowding does accomplish is a shortchanging of character development. How Sandman and Venom form an alliance in zero seconds flat is whiplash inducing as is the almost total lack of development in Topher Grace's character. He's brought in so quickly you wonder how he became so angry so fast in his evolution into Venom. Aunt May is barely in the plot at all; Peter's apartment manager and daughter get more significance. Harry/The New Goblin plays a major role throughout, but his character stages are done so abruptly that, once again, you end up wondering what the heck just happened here.<br /><br />This probably won't distract you from all the action, and Sam Raimi again delivers the goods. The flights, fights and special effects are astonishing as ever. Spiderman's suits are as sleek and cool as before, and all the gimmicks will keep your eyes on the screen. So will the obligatory Stan Lee cameo. All told, \\"Spiderman 3\\" is not a bad movie, but given that both one and two were amazing, it is still a minor let-down.he New Goblin plays a major role throughout, but his character stages are done so abruptly that, once again, you end up wondering what the heck just happened here.

B000GYI32M|4.0|So a lot of people weren't satisfied with season three of the O.C. Sure, it was a little weak compared to the other seasons. Johnny got overwhelming and Charlotte was around long past her welcome, but the impact Caitlin and Julie had on this season were amazing. Taylor was a bit annoying, but the scandal with her and the dean was a great twist.  <br /> <br />This show has something for everybody; drama, humor, romance, excitement. Who really doesn't enjoy a good fight between Ryan and Volchek?  <br /> <br />So, yes, it was a little weak, but this show and it's actors do such an amazing job that you can't help but be addicted to it. I am definately missing it, and am so grateful to TV on DVD to watch my favorite show again and again!

B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have followed Rush since 1980. And I like every album they've ever made. Ok, some more than others. In recent memory Counterparts and Vapor Trails are my top choices. Snakes and Arrows is right up there. \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" (instrumental) is an early favorite blending some old styles with the new. \\"Far Cry\\" is good solid work and I love the imagery. \\"Malignant Narcisism\\" is another winner, a short potent instrumental. In short, Rush delivers another quality album for those that appreciate their work.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I'm not a big fan of action movies, or Tom Cruise, and the only other Michael Mann movie I've seen is Last of the Mohicans. I still should have known better than to wait three years to check out Collateral after the glowing reviews and Jamie Foxx's Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Tom Cruise shows that he really does have the acting chops to pull off a variety of roles as his portrayal of Vincent is quite a departure from the typical Cruise hero. He's got a different voice, walk, and attitude. And with the white hair and beard he's captivating to watch as he unstoppably takes on the sociopathic hired [...] role.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is equally engaging as Max, a big-dreaming cab driver that has never has the follow through to make any of his dreams happen. Collateral follows a night in Max's cab and the character arc that Max follows because of the events that transpire.<br /><br />Jada Pinkett Smith has a smaller role, but still puts in some solid acting as a prosecuting attorney who rides in Max's cab.<br /><br />The action and dialogue throughout Collateral are brilliantly played out and hard to turn away from. You won't want to miss a minute of the movie for fear of missing a cool special effect, a great acing moment, or just a quick plot point. The helicopter panning shots over the city of LA are pretty awesome too.<br /><br />The second disc is full of special features, including a short about Tom Cruise dressing up as a FedEx worker in order to work on not being recognizable for the role of Vincent. There's also a making of featurette and a clip of rehearsals between Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx with director Michael Mann. It's all worth checking out.

I did not want to put this book down and felt a sadness when it was over.  I kept checking to see how many pages were left and slowed my reading accordingly. Silly, huh?!   <br />I read with a dictionay handy as there were words I did not know the meaning of (i.e. \\"macula\\" \\"fricative\\" and \\"plosives\\") as well as being unable to pass up writing comments in the margins.

B00005JPCF|1.0|First of all, why was it necessary to render the female penguins so that they had a hint of breasts? Second, it was extremely disturbing to see Mumbles and Gloria jump out of the water and land in 4 different and blatantly-obvious human sexual positions. What differentiates this from the Disney \\"myths\\" of subliminal sexual inuendos is that you really have to look at those films to try and see them. Here, it's right out in the open and apparent.  <br /> <br />Third, having a soundtrack that touts such lyrics as \\"I'll make love to you\\", is totally inappropriate for kids. The music consists of way too many horrible covers of classic songs (the worst being Brittany Murphy's awful and painfully-flat massacre of Queen's SOMEBODY TO LOVE.) intermixed with original classics that have been over-edited to fit the content of the film. <br /> <br />It's bad enough when women allow themselves to be objectified in hip-hop videos, but even worse when animators translate it to dancing penguins.  <br /> <br />Now let's look at the storyline in 3 words: Fractured, Disjointed, and Overworked.  <br />Interjecting the notion that the penguins are fishless because they lost \\"faith\\" is preposterous.  <br />The last thing this film needed was right-wing Christian fanaticism. <br />The painfully boring gaps in the story were so horrible that my daughter left the room several times.  <br />The one brightspot in all of this is that it only cost my $1 to rent it. <br /> <br />The only Happy Feet I saw were mine when after I returned this abomination to the store.  <br />Disgraceful.

0440237688|5.0|My middle school teacher recently used \\"The Giver\\" for a reading class assignment.  Several years ago I read \\"Gathering Blue\\" for my own enjoyment. Both of these books are by the author Lois Lowry.  Overall, I think these books are great.  <br /> In \\"The Giver\\", Lois Lowry creates a world where society is peaceful but very boring.  The people in the Community know nothing about true pain, or love, or death because they are sheltered from it.  At birth, they are born into a world which is shielded from anything in life that can harm them physically or mentaly. <br /> Lois Lowry uses interesting dialogue and unexpected plot twists to keep the reader interested in this world and its people.  The main characters are mostly children around 7 to 12 years old.  Some adults interact with htese characters.  Some are teachers and others are parents.  In fact, The Giver himself is an old man. <br /> I wouldn't say that this is a happy book.  In fact, there are some disturbing ideas in it.  There is a part of the book that refers to children being deliberately killed.  The parents of younger readers may not want their children exposed to this kind of subject matter.   <br /> However, I and other kids in my class found Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" to be a very interesting read.  I loved it, and went on to read her book \\"The Messenger\\" which uses characters from \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Gathering Blue\\".  If you like science fiction/fantasy literature, then you might like these books.

0060512806|3.0|I used to read Stephen King, until I got tired of the fact that he was always going on about weaknesses in human nature.  The thing about many of his plots is that the big picture story often wasn't told all that well, IMHO.  It was all the little stories he told along the way that I really liked.    Well, in Cryptonomicon,  Stephenson gets carried away so often with little digressions, little side stories.  Some of them are interesting to me, but many of them aren't, and very few of them add to the overall story.   I just read one example, where he goes on for several pages about one of his main characters eating a bowl of Captain Crunch.  I didn't find that interesting in the least.  I think this guy needs a good editor to remove about half of the 1152 pages of this book.  I find the big picture plot VERY interesting, but I may not finish this book, because I'm tired of having to wade through all the go-nowhere digressions that don't entertain or interest me.    UPDATE Dec., 09:  Don't take this book from a library, unless you read very quickly.  I bought the book, finally, and read it.  I liked it quite a lot, when I no longer felt that it was needlessly long.  No, I still don't think that every digression/incidental story was completely necessary to the book.  But, since I no longer felt any pressure to get through it, those stories  stopped bothering me.  Well, we do mostly describe ourselves, when we think we're describing something other than ourselves.  I've since read several things by Stephenson, and I like his writing quite a lot.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Is there a difference in this latest version of this DVD release? Or is it simply a marketing \\"repackage\\"? There is a difference! <br /> <br />In my opinion, the DVD transfer of this \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" is far superior to the original DVD release. In a side-by-side comparison, I was amazed to see the job that was performed on this restoration. While, the original DVD contains plenty of dirt, scratches, conversion-related distortion/noise, etc., the Special Collector's Edition looks nearly pristine. <br /> <br />There are plenty of scenes in the movie where I experienced, how can I describe it, the illusion of depth and/or three-dimensional effect. <br /> <br />This version will certainly replace my original copy.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|This movie introduced me to Jude Law and it was simply amazing... <br />I agree with all the positive reviews  and I am just going to reiterate that this is such a enjoyable film and although its quite long I never got bored and have seen it several times...Cameron is her usual adorable self and I was so pleased to see Kate winslet do a comedy role...she was so delightful and should do more of those light hearted movies...and Jude Law was so  gorgeous, endearing, his acting so natural and believable and so utterly charming in his role...I ahve seen several of his films after The Holiday and I am so mesmerized at his range and super talent...I am so glad that I have discovered him as an actor...for his super fans I highly recommend seeing his earlier film Wilde, Cold Mountain and ofcourse Alfie...that gorgeous Brit is super and unmatchable in looks, appeal and talent...
B00005JPAO|5.0|...in the hand of thy G-d.  Isaiah 62:3<br /><br />And \\"The Queen\\"'s a royal movie to place in your DVD player.<br /><br />A royalist I've slowly become.  G-d Save the Queen!  And all that.  In Great Britain, the Queen is a constitutional monarch of a country without a written constitution, yet America's rightful authors and originators of its ideals were probably nameless Anglican professors at King's College, which is now called Columbia University in New York City.  They were probably royalists too, no doubt.<br /><br />When I saw that the movie's plot would have a lot to do with Princess Diana's death a few years back, I thought I wouldn't like the movie very much, the movie entitled \\"The Queen\\" should be about The Queen and no one else.  The movie thankfully lives up to its name.  Despite my preconceived notions, I've watched this twice already and think it has not only entertainment value but educational and historical value as well.<br /><br />One of America's forefathers said,  \\"A man of real merit is never seen in so favorable a light as through the medium of adversity.\\"  In this movie, the Queen's adverse circumstances were republican/anti-monarchical forces at work which probably in reality used Princess Diana as a pawn in their game.  I think her brother, Earl Spencer got it right when he said the Press killed her.  My favorite scene in this film was the one with the little girl giving Queen Elizabeth some flowers as the Royal family stopped to read the multitude of notes left among the sea of flowers outside the gates of Buckingham Palace.  This movie also portrays the Queen's relationship with her tenth Prime Minister Tony Blair as being a dynamic one which energized, transformed the monarchy into its present state.<br /><br />Watch also the video clip of Helen Mirren.  I also was sceptical of what she could say, but was pleasantly surprised.  She deserved the Award for Best Actress, and I do agree the movie and other actors deserve kudos as well.  I personally would not mind having this movie among my worldy goods...<br /><br />The gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory...Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy G-d.  Isaiah 62:2,3s well.  I personally would not mind having this movie among my worldy goods... <br /> <br />The gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory...Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy G-d.  Isaiah 62:2,3
B000NVIXFK|5.0|History might consider this album Rush's best work. I find that Rush albums grow on me with each listen. This album, out of the box, is tremendous. It is brilliantly produced, has tons of musical hubris, and is dripping with meaning and depth. Time will tell and many Rush fans might disagree, but I think that after a few listens, you'll find that this ablum rises above the others with its totality.  Give it a listen, dig into its meaning, and enjoy the sound of three men making an album of a lifetime.
B0001CCXZW|4.0|I was happy with my purchase and I haven't had time to view all the cd's I enjoy watching when I can. I was surprised and pleased at the prompt service.
0783240287|5.0|I love this movie.  It's just so much fun to watch and as a Donny Osmond fan for ?? years I had to get this.  I've read online that he is the number one choice to play Joseph and I agree completely.  Just listen to Donny singing \\"Any Dream Will Do\\" and \\"Close Every Door\\" and you'll agree too!  The other cast members are very good too.  Joan Collins is the perfect choice to play Mrs. Potiphar.  And when you watch this you see Joseph the character, not Donny Osmond.  That's how good he is.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to anyone as it's good clean family fun.
1582701709|5.0|I've read many books that have a similar basis as The Secret, but what I liked about this book was is put most of the basic principles for Law Of Attraction (The Secret)together in a flowing format and easy terms to get the message across- focus on your thoughts, think of things you want in your life and they will come.  I've been aware of the Law Of Attraction for 5 years and this book is a great all-in-one way to remember the important ways to practice \\"The Secret\\".
B000025RX4|3.0|Just spent an afternoon surfing Winter Websites, & I'm surprised that no-one mentions 'Guess I'll Go Away'; the opening track that for me led to an interest in Johnny for years to come. I Mean 'R&R Hootchie Koo' & all are fine, but as a 13 year old guitar freak, hearing that for the 1st time really opened my mind. (I don't just mean the 'flanging', I'm still not sure of the time signature in this) A shame he didn't do much more in this vein. This album & 'Still Alive & Well', still do it for me, and are among my all time faves, but non of them are free of 'filler'..
0316010669|5.0|This book should be taught in economics courses side by side with Freakconomics.   The indepth coverage of economic learning is amazing.  The best part, its not the boring economic coverage that is seen in the class room (changes in the monetary supply, money multiplier, etc), its the real scarcity and results.   I highly recommend this book.
B00005JMCT|5.0|The unrated version of this was much better then the one i saw in the movie theater.
0811826848|5.0|Take 4 guys from England that changed the world of music forever and have them tell the story of their meteoric rise to fame and dominance of the music industry for decades and what do you have? THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY.<br /><br />John, Paul, George and Ringo made the music that we listen to today what it is. Without the British Invasion, we would never have had the development of rock and roll as it is today. Elvis and the Beatles, they are the fathers of rock and roll. This is half of that story.<br /><br />The Anthology is a great compilation of photos, album covers, artwork, lyrics, personal stories, articles and everything else Beatles. If you like the Beatles, then this is the source for every bit of information about the first super-group. You can probably find other books out there about the Beatles, but this was written by the fab four; you really can't go anywhere else to get the information you get in this book.<br /><br />This is a must have for any Beatles fan.  A must have for anyone that appreciates the history of music and rock & roll.  Well, this is just a must have.<br /><br />What more can I say? The Beatles were the original. Their story is great, their music is great, this book is great. Fact, period, end of story.
B0007VNGX0|5.0|RE: Apocalypse is a fun movie for me to watch, enjoying some of my favorite actors fighting through hordes of the undead to save a girl and get a way out of a locked down city before a nuclear explosion wipes everything out. <br /> <br />As a person studying abroad, I got the UMD for the reason that it's easy to watch on my PSP on the plane or late at night, not having a TV around to watch it on.  And I don't have to worry about a larger disc being broken in transit or the case cracking. <br /> <br />A fun movie to watch, and compact enough to carry around easily.
B00005JPFF|4.0|As the film opens, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), finds life finally going his way His relationship with girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is so great, in fact, that he's ready to ask her to marry him. And as superhero,--Spider-Man, he is much beloved by the city of New York, for all of his daring doo...<br /><br />But the celebration is short-lived. The webslinger soon finds himself facing multiple threats...Former pal Harry Osborn (James Franco) still blames Spidey for the death of his father and wants revenge; After a small meteor falls to earth, an alien organism attaches itself to his costume enhancing his powers, transforming our hero as well bringing out the vengeful side of his personality. Under the influence of the suit, Peter becomes overconfident and starts to neglect the people who care for him most. Forced to choose between the seductive power and the compassionate hero he used to be, Peter must overcome his personal demons in order to defeat two new enemies: Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace)<br /><br />As the final credits for the film began to roll--I couldn't help but think of last summer's Superman Returns...<br /><br />While I think Spider-Man 3 is a better movie overall, I think some of the same issues that hampered SR, also plagued this film...Specifics in a bit..<br /><br />Under Sam Raimi's direction, Spidey 3 offers us a lot to like: Some of the best battle scenes of the series. My favorite though, is by far, the face off between Harry as the new Goblin, and Peter. Wow! Great Stuff. Speaking of Harry, I thought Franco had the film's best performance, coming a long way since the first film. More visual high points include the birth of the Sandman and most of the Venom stuff... After 3 films, Maguire is quite comfy in the dual role, but obviously had a lot of fun exploring his dark side. Dunst spends most of her arc either bemoaning her character's stalled career or her relationship with a superhero...<br /><br />As to those issues: The screenplay by Raimi, his brother Ivan, and Alvin Sargent (Spider-Man 2) has so much going on in it, that the film seems to go all over the place at times-juggling one too many plot lines really affecting the narrative. There's also a scene between Harry and his butler that left me saying--that should have happened in the the second film... With all of this going on--some of the characters really get short-changed. I love Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson--but both really don't have that much screen time here--I also wanted to find out more about Grace's Eddie Brock and Church's Sandman-who formed a villain alliance after a 30 second encounter in an alley...Since there are so many arcs to service the editing of the film is quite uneven--rushed in some spots, yet somehow long in others. Some of this stuff could have waited until the next installment...<br /><br />The final battle is a spectacular piece of filmmaking--That said, the emotional impact of the ending is lost in a sea of predictability.<br /><br />I liked Spidey 3 a lot--it's a must see--all of those \\"issues\\" aside...But in my opinion, the sequel would have been better served by cutting the fat.
B000BLI4PG|5.0|very promp and trustworthy transaction..love the cd,my son was dead impressed i managed to make an online purchase been my first ever . <br />thank you Amazon ! <br /> your Amazing !
B00004RJ74|5.0|This is my all time favorite George Clooney movie. The action never seems to die in this movie. I loved George Clooney as Seth Gecko. You've gotta buy this movie if your a fan of George Clooney.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|These women posess an amazing talent and yet are still humble the american music scene should take a lesson. Brava ladies you've done it again.
B00003CXFV|5.0|This movie is worth seeing for a lot of reasons, and for Julia fans, it's a movie that definitely isn't Julia playing Julia, as she has so many times.  I have a feeling she had to stretch to portray the brassy, pushy, rude Erin, and she did so brilliantly.<br /><br />Erin is one of those ladies you love to hate, until you see the goodness and intelligence that may not be the first thing that most people notice about her.  And she's a bulldog.  Once she gets moving in one direction, there's no stopping her which is a good thing, at least in the true story that this movie portrayed.<br /><br />This is a funny, heartwarming, and eye-opening movie that's really worth seeing.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|Only Hollyweird could find a reason to award this steaming pile.  Unrealistic cinematography.  No redeeming entertainment value.
B00009ATIX|5.0|GREAT MOVIE! Well any movie with George Clooney is a great movie in my book. But it has a very good Story too.
0060594896|5.0|Whether you're just needing a little assistance to hone one's performance attitude or in need of a complete remake, I highly suggest this book.  Jack has put together a collection of skills that apply to anyone in any walk of life.  Try it.  It won't hurt.
B00005JCA9|5.0|This is a charming movie that I've seen several times and will probably see again.  It's an upbeat, miracles happen, \\"celebrities are people too\\" kind of movie.<br /><br />Boy meets girl, girl says \\"NO\\", then changes her mind. And keeps changing it.  Anyone who has said \\"No\\", when his/her heart was yelling, \\"Yes Yes Yes \\", can relate to this movie a lot.<br /><br />One of the aspects that I found so interesting was the rigidly controlled structure under which Anna was required to live her life.  And how relentlessly she had to smile, regardless of how she was feeling.  It must be tough to have to be \\"on\\" so much of the time.  NOTTING HILL gave us a window into the world in which celebrities live and some of the challenges they face.<br /><br />This is a heartwarming, funny movie starring 2 talented actors playing 2 really likable characters.  I have a weakness for movies with American/British romantic pairings, since Americans and Brits are culturally so different; in this movie, the plot is sweetened with the added romantic complication of wealthy/famous and not so wealthy or famous. It's a heartwarming rollicking ride !<br /><br />I highly recommend Notting Hill.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Thank you, Rush, for satisfying this thirsty fan's long wait for fine porter ale, or maybe oatmeal stout. Far Cry is as near-perfect an encapsulation of everything good about Rush as I could ask for, except maybe a guitar solo. That's no quibble given the variety and tightness of the overall song--anyway, guitar textures, accents, and moody lead breaks (plus more than a few solos) appear throughout the album. Armor and Sword has a beautiful intro, then lots of promise into the verses, but ultimately drones on a bit. It's the low point of the album, but still it's a decent enough song. The next couple tracks are okay, then the album re-launches with the creepy, pictorial surge of Spindrift and nicely bubbles on almost to the end. The instrumentals are very welcome--not spectacular, but solid and enjoyable. The musicianship is excellent throughout, as always. Overall, the album is a profound work that froths and surges with energy and will take some time to fully appreciate.    In many ways, that's the best thing about Rush in the 21st century--there's so much to their music that it takes a while to get your arms around it and figure out what the guys wanted to achieve. In the case of Vapor Trails, it took about four years. Snakes and Arrows probably won't take as long, but still--how many groups have been together for 30+ years, with the same line-up, and offer material that warrants such close and lengthy study? I can't think of any. Mugs in the air for Rush!
B000K9L32U|4.0|Great come back album. more mature than previous albums but still hints of their earlier work.
B00006LPEY|5.0|Akira should be on everyones top ten list. It has a great story and style.
B000002L9J|5.0|1987 all over again...Me and my friend Jennifer, the only two \\"freaks\\" in town spent our entire summer beating around town in her vintage VW Bug listening to this cassette (remember cassettes?) This album was a turning point for me in what kind of music I was listening too. Every song on this disc is perfect. The music and lyrics are witty to heart wrentching. Morrisey and Marr had that chemistry, that little magic that showed itself in a big way. Anyone wanting to know more about The Smiths should start with this album. Personally I think we need a revival. So get this disc and if you don't have a vintage VW Bug any car will do, pop it in roll down all the windows and cruise away.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|When new music finds its way into our soundscape, we sometimes find it difficult to make it fit.  As we get more engaged in our listening habits over the course of our lives, it sometimes takes a degree of patience to really decide as to whether an album is worth the trouble or not.  Inevitably, the majority of the music that we are initially enthusiastic about seems to have a short life in the player and, conversely, music that we don't understand at first (and subsequently invest ourselves in) tends to keep our attention in the long run.  As a result of our increasingly short attention spans this latter music is highly criticized and often dismissed.  This phenomenon is manifested in the seeming desire to seek fault rather than strength in the music we listen to, without giving ourselves the opportunity to dwell with the music and come to an understanding of its meaning.<br /><br /> This problem is particularly exacerbated when a band's longevity has ensured their music's place in the soundtrack of so many people's lives.  There is an inevitable tendency to rely on our nostalgic recontexualization as an ideal, closing ourselves to the possibilities of the music in front of us.  Many people, including myself, struggle with this issue in regards to Rush.  I was exposed to Rush through \\"Power Windows,\\" which is one of my all-time favorite albums.  I came to love everything before that album, but I struggled with \\"Hold Your Fire,\\" as it did not fit within my concepts of what Rush did or what they had done before.  As I have talked to other Rush fans, they tend to similarly romanticize their initial experiences with Rush.  Their first experiences, and the history that led up to them, define their ideas about the band.  Subsequent releases by the band tend to challenge the listener's perception.<br /><br />With this in mind, I have an undeniable urge to compare \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" with \\"Moving Pictures\\" and \\"Power Windows,\\" but ultimately I have to accept that this  aspect of Rush's repertoire is informed by romanticized recollections of my youth.  Thanks to the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia, things are NEVER as good as they once were.<br /><br /> In some ways, Rush addresses this issue on \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" very directly.  The obvious harmonic references to their \\"Hemispheres\\" era is palpable throughout the album, as is exemplified in \\"Far Cry,\\" \\"Armor and Sword,\\" and \\"Faithless,\\" while the arrangements of the multiple instrumental tracks \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" and particularly \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" recall the \\"Moving Pictures\\" era.  In some ways, these references admittedly teeter on the brink of manipulation.  On my first listening, I felt that Rush was effectively sampling themselves in an effort to establish their own authenticity, and I am still not totally convinced that this is not the case.<br /><br /> However, \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is hardly a rehash of Rush's early work.  Instead, subsequent listenings reveal it to be a compelling synthesis of a significant body of their repertoire.  It has much of the short-form compositional complexity that \\"Power Windows\\" and \\"Hold Your Fire\\" exhibits, but it also represents the song-based approach exemplified by \\"Counterparts\\" and \\"Test for Echo.\\"  Within the harmonic landscape of their early work, this blend of Rush's compositional strengths and their more recent lyrical approach is aurally compelling.<br /><br />After all, it is not uncommon for musicians and bands with a long history to unify their output into a singular sound.  Peter Gabriel's \\"Up,\\" King Crimson's \\"The Power to Believe,\\" and, in some ways, TooL's \\"10,000 Days\\" are all examples of this tendency.  \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" attends to this goal in ways that are very subtle.  Without taking the time to unravel what the album is trying to say both musically and lyrically in the context of Rush's history, the passive listener may not allow themselves to be open to the album's intent.<br /><br /> As a brief aside, the lyrical content of \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is undoubtedly shows Peart as his most personal.  Although I do not think that he has written his definitive novel yet, reading his written work to date provides insight into the circumstances that led him to address concepts of \\"faith\\" and \\"belief\\" for this album.  Understanding his text gives him a specific authority that imbues lines like \\"No one gets to Heaven without a fight\\" with a certain weight.  Despite the elitist attitude that many people read into his text, I have a certain amount of sympathy for his hidden insecurity that seems to breed this attitude. Personally, I think that many people misread his defensive insecurity as elitism, but having never met him beyond his writing, this is purely conjecture.<br /><br />The Lowdown:  Rush fans will undoubtedly be divided on \\"Snakes & Arrows,\\" as it refers to everything before it while simultaneously defying the ideas surrounding Rush's repertoire.  The most devoted fan will come to understand it, while many others will dismiss it because the attention that it requires is the same as the kind of attention they might have paid to their older sibling's singular copy of \\"Moving Pictures,\\" which played again and again beyond their control.

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Absolutely the best business calclulator. The programming is a bit cryptic but other than that the functions to calculate the PMT, NPP, FV is so easy that sometimes you think why do you even need a calculator. I guess, thats the achivement of this little monster. The leather pack is a bit cheap looking. But the calcultor itself looks great and easy to operate.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|This movie wants to give you a message, it really wants to give you a message.  The only problem is the message is not even worth getting.  I personally think it would be a great thing if women became infertile for 20 years. Our population is out of control, why is it a bad thing exactly?  Why are they so concerned about immigration and getting the illegals out of each country?  They never explain the need to rid each country of illegal immigrants.  Why would you be concerned w/ immigrants in 2027 when we do nothing about them now?  They never explain why this is especially a problem.  The violence is completely unnecessary.  Why would the world turn increasingly more violent if women were infertile?  The movie never explains this.  In fact, this movie never explains anything and you're left thinking why did I even bother watching this nonsense for 2 hours??  It's not even the type of thing that makes you think, wow this could happen.  It's just bleak and poorly done overall.
B000EMGA3U|3.0|OK, I'll be the detractor here who didn't really get into this.  First of all if you don't like the tuned down droning clashing no wave dissonance thing, this isn't where you need to be.  That wasn't my problem, and considering you probably like the band already, it isn't a problem for you.  The music pieces and ideas here just aren't all that well formulated and the band doesn't really have it's own voice yet.  The sound isn't particularly original for it's time either.  The sound and musical palate aren't really that far off from what quite post punk bands were doing.  Early Joy Division, Public Image, Gang of Four, and Wire come to mind as better examples.  They do seem to have an idea where they want to go, but it is a young band messing around with someone else's ideas.  There are interesting sections here, though much of the recording becomes tedious after a few listens.  I kept getting the feeling that the needle on my old record player had gotten stuck at the end of the song \\"heroin\\"   <br /> <br />It's interesting were they started but I have to say this one is for completists. Who knows though, these kids might make something of it a few years down the road.   <br />
B000NA28IE|4.0|on a whole I liked the movie,the special effects where great,the dragon was really beliveable.The movie needed to be much longer as they left out too much story lines from the book.
B00068TJM6|3.0|The reason I didnt like it: <br />1. I wear my watch on my right wrist. The buttons becomes annoying when you are driving. <br />2. The alarm needs to be fixed every time. Thats just not easy to do. Especially the process you have to go through to fix the alarm time. <br />3. The look and feel is great but the realistic value of the watch is not there compared to the offering.  <br />Overall a B+
B000MZHW40|5.0|Blood Diamond had all the suspense and action of a top notch spy thriller. Leonardo di Caprio held on to his South African accent with ease. I was shocked and amazed by the story development. I give it my top rating, and would encourage anyone who enjoys excellent storylines and excellent acting to watch it.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|There have been movies adapted from books that are as good as or better than the novels. (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Godfather 1 & 2, for example.) Unfortunately, A Good Year isn't one of them. The novel by Peter Mayle is so-so, but still better than the screenplay. Why couldn't the script follow the storyline as Mayle had written it? The main character, Max Skinner, is more likable in the novel. (Sort of like a Hugh Grant type of character.) Russell Crowe's Max is arrogant and obnoxious. Perhaps this mirrors Crowe's off-screen personality, which has been heavily played up in the supermarket tabloids. The movie isn't all that terrible, though. The scenery is absolutely stunning and the beautiful Marion Cotillard is sexy and very French. As a comedy, I think it isn't as funny as French Kiss. Even so, pour yourself a glass of wine and enjoy the south of France.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|I recently bought this for my husband.He specifically asked me to get him the \\"non-edited\\" version and I didn't see anywhere that this CD was an \\"edited\\" version, so I went ahead and bought it.  I received the CD a couple of days later and that's when I realized it was edited!!!!! I came back to amazon to see if I had just missed the labeling of the CD. I could not find it specified anywhere on the page & that's when I saw the deluxe CD/DVD combo. I checked it out and sure enough the only way you can get the unedited version here is to get both the CD & DVD !! I personally think that sucks! And, I think Amazon should require this to be listed in the description, \\"edited\\" or \\"unedited\\"!!!<br /><br />I loved the CD though!!! :) Thank you!!!
B000002LUB|3.0|At least as far as studio albums are concerned... anyway, let's get to it: first let me tell you that my ACTUAL rating for this album would have to be 3 ½ stars (I'll explain why later), but since I cannot put that...sporting one of the goofiest album covers ever, \\"Dehumanizer\\" is the third and last studio album recorded by the Dio led Black Sabbath, but it was the second I got. Common wisdom points that one should normally buy records in chronological order in order to fully experience the evolution of the artist, and while I don't always agree with this notion, I'd say that this is one of those instances where it truly rings true.<br /><br />As you can read in my review for \\"Heaven & Hell\\", I am a latter day Sabbath fan, and in my country back then, you just couldn't go into a record store and pick whichever record you wanted. You had to buy what they had or order cd's at an obscene price. So shortly after falling in love with \\"H&H\\", I wanted more, and I started to look for the other 2 Dio Sabbath releases. It would take me some 2 years to finally get \\"The Mob Rules\\"(which I ultimately HAD to order, at an obscene price, because record stores just wouldn't carry it), but I was able to find \\"Dehumanizer\\" after a few weeks of digging, and my curiosity overcame by chronological stubbornness.<br /><br />So I went home to play the record hoping to find some more material like \\"H&H\\", only to be hit in the head with the unashamed, unabashed, unforgiving heaviness of \\"Computer God\\". I was totally shocked, but in a good way, mind you: I thought the music was dark and heavy, the sound potent, Dio (my ALL TIME favorite singer) in top form, Tony spewing pure darkness from his SG guitar, Geezer rocking the bottom end  like I had never heard him before and Vinny Appice pummeling like there was no tomorrow. To this day, that song remains my favorite of the album and one of my favorite Dio Sab tunes overall. I just loved it! Everything was top notch: the music, the performances, the lyrics, the sound...superlative, really...<br /><br />The band sounds very tight, with regained focus for the most part, and I believe the production really showcases the best that these musicians had to offer at the time. Of special notice are the lyrics of this album and its subject matter: Ronnie was going through his \\"angry period\\", which started with his own \\"Lock up the Wolves\\" and encompasses \\"Dehumanizer\\", `Strange Highways\\" and \\"Angry Machines\\". And it is a BIG change, since you're not gonna find his trademark dungeons and dragons fairytales here, but rather much rawer, down to earth lyrics.<br /><br />The next song, \\"After All (The Dead)\\", I must admit was a bit of a surprise after such an auspicious start: very slow, very doom-y, and in all honesty, it didn't impress me as much. In time, I came to appreciate it more, but it's not one of my favorites, I must say. I thought (and I still think to this day) that it was in the wrong place, cutting dramatically the pace of the album. Something that becomes that much more obvious with the next song, the gargantuan \\"TV Crimes\\": again fast, heavy, brutal, a definite highlight. The album contains at least 3 more jewels: the swift and heavy \\"Time Machine\\", the powerful \\"I\\" and closing \\"Buried Alive\\". The former was a winner with me at first listen, and having had the privilege of catching a live performance of this song last year by Dio (the band), I really must say that it remains just as vital and powerful after all these years, while the latter also took me a little time to get, but once I got it, it became one of my favorites.<br /><br />At first listen, there were 3 songs that didn't particularly attract my attention: \\"Letters from Earth\\", \\"Master of Insanity\\" and \\"Sins of the Father\\". While not scorchers like the ones I mentioned before, they keep the pace going. But to be honest with you, at first I thought they were \\"filler\\". Before you start sending death threats my way, let me define what \\"filler\\" means to me: to me, \\"filler\\" is not necessarily a bad song, but simply one that, after repeated listening, fails to catch my attention, meaning that I can't sing along the chorus (because I can't remember it), I can't hum the melody or any of its riffs. Simply put, songs that in and by themselves fail to catch my attention. And after all (no pun intended...) these years, I still think that category applies at least for \\"Master of...\\", 'cos I've grown to really like \\"Letters...\\" and \\"Sins...\\".<br /><br />And if we're going to be completely honest about things, then I must also say that \\"Too Late\\" falls in this category as well: EVEN IF I LIKE IT, I still think that the song is not as good as it could (should?) have been. My guess is that they were hoping for a new \\"Children of the Sea\\" or \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\", but this one doesn't quite cut it. The last song on this CD is an alternate version of \\"Time Machine\\" which was used for the soundtrack of the movie \\"Wayne's World\\" (possibly the original demo of the song...): for the most part, it's the same song with a few changes in the lyrics and a somewhat sleeker, cleaner, softer production which I guess was (maybe...?) an attempt to get radio airplay and exposure (?). It is good, but I honestly like the original, heavier version much better.<br /><br />Now, many critics and fans alike have stated that this record sounds a little like a \\"Master of Reality-era kind of riffs\\" album with Dio singing instead of Ozzy, and while I do not fully agree with that, I must admit that they probably have a point: the music does sound a little like a throwback to the classic Ozzy-era songwriting of nasty guitar riffs. In any case, I think the music is closer to \\"Master of Reality\\" than it is to the more melodic, straightforward direction of \\"Heaven & Hell\\". But here's the thing: if you listen to the 3 Dio Sabbath albums in chronological order, the evolution DOES make sense: you'll hear the \\"melody meets heaviness\\" approach of \\"H&H\\", the \\"increased heaviness with melody\\" formula of \\"Mob Rules\\" and the \\"take no prisoners, heaviness first, melody second\\" approach of \\"Dehumanizer\\". After finally adding \\"The Mob Rules\\" to my collection, suddenly this record made perfect sense. This is by far the heaviest record of the Dio trilogy. According to an interview with Geezer on the Jan '98 issue of American magazine \\"Metal Edge\\", he came up with A LOT of the riffs for this record, specifically, A LOT of the heaviest material. After hearing what Geezer has done with his G/Z/R band, I'd say he's telling the truth!<br /><br />The bottom line: as a fan, I'd give this record 4 stars because I enjoy it a whole lot, but as a (ehem...) \\"critic\\", I must also admit that it is NOT in the same category as the first 2 records from this lineup, and therefore I'd give it 3 stars. So, by making an average, I get the final rating of 3 ½ stars that I told you about at the start. (If you read my reviews for the other 2 records, you'll have more context). It is a shame that this reunion was short lived and only produced this last record, as I believe they could've given us much more.<br />Want proof? Look no further than the lyrics to \\"Computer God\\", written well before the advent of the internet!!! They ring even \\"truer\\" NOW than 15 years ago, when they were originally written! If you ask me, I think that this music has aged just as good as their music from their 70's heyday. But in the end, I think that the album was rushed and could've benefited from a little more pre-production: I mean, 6 great songs out of 10 is not bad, but it is a long shot from a true classic. This record is to Black Sabbath what \\"Perfect Strangers\\" was to Deep Purple: a difficult comeback record done after 10 years of not working together, and the result was just the same, only a \\"good\\" record when it should've been a GREAT record. If you're looking to get started with the Dio Sabbath, I'd suggest you go the chronological way. But if you like heavymusic and you're willing to take chances...a of \\"Mob Rules\\" and the \\"take no prisoners, heaviness first, melody second\\" approach of \\"Dehumanizer\\".

B000J103PC|5.0|I loved this movie! I did not even expect to love it! It was so charming and so funny. Meryl Streep is just so wicked, and yet, oops, vulnerable. Stanley Tucci is outstanding. Anne Hathaway and her great eyes are a revelation. [What a contrast to her other offering, \\"Havoc\\".] I wish I could dress like these ladies, every day. Poor Emily Blunt gets short shrift, but she does a great job, as well. The storyline is what gets you, though. It is extremely well-written, if not original. I recommend giving it a spin, dearie.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Here's my take on the whole project, or at least here's what my take would be, if \\"LOVE\\" had only come into existence as a music mash-up alone (which it didn't, but anyway):<br /><br /> GM: \\"Hey Dad, check this out! One of my buddies discovered this cool thing when you strip Ringo's drums out of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and put 'em on top of George doing \\"Within You Without You\\". Isn't that totally bomb?\\"<br /><br /> GM: \\"Huh? Yes? What? Bomb? oh yes.. certainly Giles.. yes, brilliant.. uhh, smashing.. yes. What was that then?\\"<br /><br /> GM: \\"Hey Dad, can me and my friends mess around in your workshop for a few months?\\"<br /><br /> GM: \\"Well, uhh, what was that? Work around in a mess tent? Whositwhatsinwhuffenahrrezzencheesenfroth - eh - kids.\\"<br /><br />As seems to be the case in so many other instances, whether the results are fantastic or not, or original or not, or artistically sound or not, whether they are revealing of creativity, integrity and courage, or just revealing - nepotism keeps the cultural world spinning around these days. We should all be so fortunate to have the Beatles' only producer for a father, or to have the next \\"thing\\" to happen to their music for a son.<br /><br />So, naturally, I just can't wait to hear what happens when Sean Ono Lennon gets together with Dhani Harrison and they go over to play at Keith Richards' grand-kids' platinum studio in the Bahamas as part of Capitol/EMI's efforts to reprise \\"The Dirty Mac\\"! It's gonna be GREAT whether it actually is or not! What it's going to be is a great marketing opportunity for whoever is behind it - that's what it's going to be. And that's largely what \\"LOVE\\" is also, except for the fact that that's not the whole story. For THAT part of the story, either look carefully through the reviews on these pages for more of the low-down, or stay tuned for Part 2 of this review. (\\"The Dirty Mac\\" was actually Lennon, Clapton, Keith on bass, and Mitch Mitchell on drums - think I'd rather listen to their one track, \\"Yer Blues\\", over and over again every day than to spend very much time with \\"LOVE\\" where, as Lennon once said, \\"nothing is real\\".)<br /><br />Personally, I think that \\"LOVE\\" is all just \\"HYPE\\" for the *really big* Beatles roll-out that's about to happen. Now the big question hanging out there is this: When we finally DO get the Beatles re-masters that we've been waiting for, in the next decade or so, how much of the \\"great detail we've never heard before\\" will be stuff that they didn't want us to hear? Or, worse, how much will be stuff that they NEVER EVEN PLAYED??<br /><br />Musically, I can accept most of what happens on \\"LOVE\\" from about track #14 (TNK/WYWY) onwards, especially the low-impact stuff like #19 (Come Together / Dear Prudence / Cry Baby Cry), but I get MAD AS HELL when I try to start the disc from the git-go, and cannot even count out *full measures* with those brilliant a cappella voices on \\"Because\\" - IT SIMPLY IS NOT MUSICAL, GILES! Ahhhh!! Dear reader - if you're really intent on collecting music mash-ups that are entirely MUSICAL from start to finish, and head-wagging-ear-splitting at the same time, start with Steve Reich - [[ASIN:B00000I5LV Reich Remixed]] and progress from there to something like Beck - [[ASIN:B000BYR9QI Guerolito]]. Trim them stars for \\"LOVE\\" down to three and a half.<br /><br />Bottom Line: You're from Gen Next? You'll think \\"LOVE\\" is indispensable. You're from MyGen and you want a good laugh at the expense of the original Beatles' music? Watch [[ASIN:B00004ZEU2 The Rutles - All You Need Is Cash]] DVD, and of course the follow-up, [[ASIN:B0006Q94BO The Rutles 2 -  Can't Buy Me Lunch]]. End of story? Hardly.<br /><br />Hats must be taken off, btw, in salute to the big Amazon machine right here for what *they* have mashed-up. Consider: would you rather read what ONE \\"expert reviewer\\" thinks of this release on a site like AMG, where they claim to want your (yes, your very own) descriptive and/or corrective input, but are really too overwhelmed with everything they're trying to do by themselves to care? Or would you rather see (and read, if you have the time for 400 some odd reviews) the messy wheels of democracy in action, right here on these pages, while enjoying the convenience of one-stop shopping?!?!<br /><br /> GM & GM: \\"Oh nice plug, very nice, yes, that's smashing, that's what that is alright, very nice, right then.\\"to care?

B000OMD4BG|4.0|Okay, so I was a bit harsh in my initial review.    In reality, the only songs I STILL feel have too much noise reduction are \\"See You Later\\", \\"Half Right\\", and \\"High Times\\". They just sound \\"strange\\", that really watery sound that comes with too much noise reduction. In other songs, it's apparent, but it doesn't really take away too much from the songs.    I still disagree with harsh noise reduction, but it's not too bad on this collection overall.    In retrospect, some of these songs sound so close the albums they were recorded for that it's scary. The mixing, production, and other elements very much remind me of the Elliott Smith and Either/Or albums.    Some of these songs you listen and you think you may know why they went unreleased until now. Any songwriter would KILL to be able to write songs like this, but when you stack it up to stuff like \\"Ballad of Big Nothing\\" or \\"Christian Brothers\\" and the like, you have to cut some of the good stuff for the stuff that's absolutely stunning.    And then there are the handful of songs on this collection that just have you absolutely baffled as to why Elliott ever left them behind. \\"New Monkey\\", \\"Placeholder\\", \\"Going Nowhere\\", and \\"New Disaster\\" (Larry did an amazing job combining two different takes for this song) just blew me away when I first heard them. Easily some of Elliott's best stuff.    The one thing that still irks me, which isn't Larry or anyone else's fault, really: that damn drum track in \\"Pretty Mary K\\" (other version)! Oh God, what a beatiful song, and it would have belonged in the paragraph I just wrote... but that drum track. It goes right up against the ethereal sound of every other element and it just doesn't work. The drum track is not in the rough mix previously availible. I can't listen to this version, it literally makes me sad to know that we'll probably never hear a clear version without the drum track.    All in all: to an audiophile, the noise reduction isn't great, but it's not as bad as myinitial review made it out to be. The songs are overall great, and are important to Elliott's catalogue. A great \\"effort\\" by Elliott (sort of?!) and a great effort (for real) to those involved and those who assembled this collection.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This one of my favorite movies but I'll leave the movie review to the critics.  The DVD arrived before the promised delivery date (not at all unusual for Amazon!) and is in perfect shape.   <br />The closed caption is very helpful to me as I have a slight hearing loss and the women talk fast.  Now I don't miss a single hilarious line--and there are lots of them.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King for years, It (the movie) was one of my fav's growing up, this move scared the holy crap out of me when i was young, it scared me so bad, that I really didn't want to brush my teeth, take a bath, or anything else that had to do with a drainage of some type! you take a scary,alien clown, put it in the sewers, have it chop up a few kids, and haunt the kids of the past, all the way up to their adult years, it's just creepy, but creepy fun, this is one to turn the lights off on and cuddle up with someone to watch and be jolted!
0689505698|5.0|My children love this role reversal version of the classic story and so do I!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|At last, a truly funny American movie with a biting undercurrent.  No violence, no car chases and no explosions.  The first-rate cast is obviously having fun.  The writing is sheer genius and the direction is impeccable.  Thanks to everybody involved with the making of this film.
B0009X7664|5.0|This movie will set you back in time and make you sit on the edge of your seat! A Blast from the past..or is it? I am sure injustice is happening somewhere even today! Some innocent person receiving a death sentence for no reason other than just being there...the wrong place at the wrong time! <br />A Classic. Enjoy!
B000MQ55FM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae - The CD is excellent - I can't wait until something new comes out. It is about time to hear something different and good. Kudos to Corinne and the producers of this CD - for a job well done - keep the creative juices flowing.
B000NA28IE|2.0|The movie does not add up to the book but the special effects are cool.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|Elliott Smith was a musical genius that had the potential to reach deeper into the listener than anything I have ever heard, but, sadly, most folks just won't \\"get it\\".  That only makes his music even more precious to those of us who do.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of this musical,CATS,ever since I was little I would beg my mom to go to my grandparents house to watch this musical,they had the VHS. I wanted to know how they did everything on this movie.Now that I have the DVD I can watch how they did the make-up,the rehersals,the original broadway show. This is the most Amazing musical ever.It's even better when you watch how they did everything.
B000MV9026|5.0|A little long for my 2 yr old g'daughter, but she loves it and has already started singing the songs.  She even knows the \\"scairy parts\\" and says the \\"shark\\" is bad-it's a large sea lion.  Some parts are a little too intense for her.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I have a 6 and a 2 year old.  They love this movie.  I've been looking all over trying to locate it for our movie library.  The quality of this movie is awesome.  The sound effects are great.  I notice they've added a few more songs to the movie since it was first viewed in 1994.  I was pleased to see that my two year old was not afraid of the hyenas.  He thinks that scar is mean.  Moreover, he insist on watching it every weekend.
141694740X|2.0|We are all only human beings living this complex thing called Life. The kind of advice this book gives can only backfire. It's just too superficial to make any sense. If you are having trouble in your intimate relationships why don't you go and learn about YOURself and the things INSIDE you that could be getting in the way? It's a hard journey but well worth the price. The two stars go to the authors (doomed) effort to try and help their best in this complicated arena.

074356619X|4.0|I purchased the cd of \\"The Secret\\" and really enjoyed its positive thinking concept. We've heard this message a thousand times, but it really is refreshing to learn how to put those concepts into action.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I can see where THE PRESTIGE, a very cunning piece of work, is going to require future viewings for me to fully grasp the story which is so intricate that reviewing it is more difficult than usual.<br /><br />For the sake of brevity, let me say that it's all about illusions in the dark world of magic in the 18th Century theater world. The period atmosphere is captured completely so that London of that era is beautifully rendered in low key lighting effects. The performances are all of the highest caliber, including the principal jobs by HUGH JACKMAN and CHRISTIAN BALE as magicians jealous of each other's talent.<br /><br />All the other roles are played well but it's MICHAEL CAINE in a peripheral part that stands out the most.<br /><br />There's an absorbing mystery at the heart of the tale and a plot twist that some may have guessed long before it happens, but it's the kind of film you can enjoy on a different level the second or third time.<br /><br />Summing up: Definitely worth viewing.
B00009V7P8|4.0|This CD is better than I had thought. It is very sensitive, varied with a personal style. You do listen the song number 10.
020530902X|5.0|This little book has been the best asset I have had with my writng.  I use it for both myself and my son.  I especially like the first section concerning uses of coma's.  It should be in every students book bag and homeschooler class.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|i cant really give an objective review as bob is my favorite artist but as he has moved into his sixtys he doesnt stop being relevant he is without question the single most song and dance man on the planet the music is underplayed on the cd it was recorded using his current touring band this will allow improvisation when on tour quite brilliant
0753453800|5.0|I read to my 11 and 9 year old daughters, a chapter a night and this one was perfect.  It's not only a great story line, but allows children to identify with the main character.  The graphic scenes describing various altercations between the crew and owners is relevant and realistic.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Patrick O'Brien's 20 Aubrey/Maturin books are a marvellously intelligent, multi-layered, thoughtfully characterised ongoing story of life in Nelson's navy. Master and Commander is not Patrick O'Brien, Russell Crowe is not Jack Aubrey, and Paul Bettany is certainly no Stephen Maturin. Nevertheless, the film works wonderfully as a swashbuckling, authentic, engaging historical tale. The sound effects are brilliant, giving the feeling of actually being on the ship. The scenery is heaven and the story fast paced. A beaut film that I'll watch again and again.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Great CD! I like nearly every song and there are definite influences from Black Sabbath, Hendrix, Doors and Zeppelin. Good stuff!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|My husband loves this CD and brings it to work with him every day!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|The music of Rush spans more than three decades. During that time Neil Peart, Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson have continued to evolve, reinventing their style with almost each new album. Each phase in their musical evolution has its fans. Often, a new album is a shock for those accustomed to an earlier sound. Only after listening to their newest batch of songs for a while you get used to the \\"new\\" Rush and accept it. Until the next album comes along. That's why I wrote \\"their latest album is always their worst\\" when reviewing Vapor Trails. However, I was wrong. With Snakes & Arrows Rush have delivered their best album since Signals, perhaps even since Moving Pictures. Their well of inspiration seems full to the brim once again. I'm looking forward to their next decade.
1582701709|4.0|This is truly an amazing little book.  Once I srarted to read it , could not put it down ! After I had read it, I felt as if there was new life breathed into me .  This is not your average self help book,  it is much deeper than that. <br />It makes one see more clearly , and gives an understanding of why certain things come into our lives, good or bad. A real eye opener ! I want everyone around me to know  \\" The Secret \\". <br /> <br />

B00068CVJ4|4.0|Before there was the Mars Volta there was At The Drive In.  The singer and guitarist went on to form the more famous band.  Since I hadn't heard of At The Drive In until after they went their own ways, I first heard the CD in comparison to the Mars Volta.  There are a lot of similarities, the singing and guitar are of course coming from the same place.  The songs are very dramatic, and some of the intros hint at the later noise experiments of the Mars Volta. <br /> <br />This is a very listenable CD, because the songs are a reasonable length, and they rock out.  There's very little extraneous, and everything on the CD is good.

0670036544|5.0|Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes adventure of a spectral hound from hell gets a fresh treatment in this Viking book, part of their 'Whole Story' series.<br /><br />In an attempt to make 'Hound of the Baskervilles' accessible to new readers, Viking has taken the original text and supplemented it with fresh illustrations of Holmes, Watson, Henry Baskerville and action scenes from the novel along with period and contemporary photos and diagrams. The photos and diagrams - which depict London scenes, English landscapes, etc. - come with extended captions. The illustrations of Holmes, et al. feature an appropriate quote from the text. Much of the illustrative material is in color. The overall product is quite an attractive, appealing piece.<br /><br />This Viking edition, copyrighted 2004, was originally published in France in 2002. The book's illustrator, Nicollet by name, certainly created a distinctive look for Holmes and Watson, which is where I have a problem. In several illustrations Nicollet's Holmes is an impossibly thin caricature of a person, a study in awkwardness. Watson, in turn, comes across as a dullard in several Nicollet illustrations.<br /><br />In any case, this is an interesting, visually appealing reimagining of Doyle's novel. It should appeal to young and old readers alike!

B000NVIXFK|4.0|The first thing you notice when you spin (or in my case iPod)Snakes & Arrows, the new outing by Rush, is that the heavy musical voice of Rush is back.  Very ambitious!  Very sonically sophisticated!  Very good! I've been a fan for many, many, many years, since I was like 10 years old, and that's 28 years! I own everything they've ever done. You could say, yes, that I am a Rush fan.  Now, the possible bad news: this is not Moving Pictures.  This is not Hemispheres or Signals or Permanent Waves or Power Windows.  The old Rush is long gone and it's very hard to look back without a pang of longing, of sadness.  So it goes. The ony bad thing I'll say about Sankes & Arrows is that unlike Moving Pictures or Hemispheres or Signals or so many of their older albums, there are very few hooks here to distinguish many of the later songs from one another. That is distracting and makes it so much harder to remember the songs and their titles.  Let's break down the album:<br /><br />Far Cry - Lyrically, I like it very much.  Driving, pounding Rush straigh out of the gate.  I immediately like the feel that this song gives off.  Sounds like old Rush in a way.  One day I feel I'm on top of the world, the next it's falling in on me! Great opening song.<br /><br />Armor And Sword - Does this song purposely drag?  It does. Musically sound.  I don't really dig the lyrics or the way Geddy delivers them.  Sounds strained.  Not going to be a favorite.<br /><br />Workin' Them Angels - Sounds like something off of Test For Echo. Forceful and yet a little light.  Is that possible?  Yeah.  I like the chorus and the sound is strangely experimental in places like Alex is rocking the mandolin or something in the background.  Sounds very nearly Irish and I like that.  Wrokin' them angels - Overtime!<br /><br />The Larger Bowl - Acoustic and moody.  This reminds me of Resist in its simplicity and yet it builds in complexity.  Some are blessed and some are cursed, the golden one or scarred from birth.  Dark. Definitely. I like it.<br /><br />Spindrift - Yeah.  You can feel the press of this song, like a funeral dirge or a piece of dramatic prose.  Driven.  That's what I call it.  Driven.  What am I supposed to say?  Where are the words to answer you when you talk that way?  Oh yeah!<br /><br />The Main Monkey Business - Instrumental.  Layered.  Complex.  Very structurally sound.  Not YYZ.  Not La Villa Strangiato.  Elegant.  Cryptic.  Classic?  I'm going to say no, just because I don't crave to hear it again and again.  A great piece of work, but, like I said, not YYZ.  I can hum that from memory.  I can't with this.<br /><br />The Way The Wind Blows - I like the drum intro in the bluesy wail of Alex's guitar.  Nice.  Very nice!  This some comes at you and that is unexpected this deep into a newer Rush album.  The sound here is elegant.  Pray, and pass the ammunition.  Political commentary on the dark way of the world.<br /><br />Hope - Two instrumentals on the same album?  Wow!  Do I hear another bit of Irish influence here?  I think I do and I like it alot.  Acoustic and ambitious. More of a blurb than the typical Rush instrumental, this sounds like a straight-ahead nod to Alex playing something he wanted us to hear and it works very well.<br /><br />Faithless - This sounds like something off of Geddy's solo album, My Favorite Headache.  Not going to be a memorable song.  It's a tad to airy and hookless.  Middle of the road.<br /><br />Bravest Face - Here the songs really start to blend.  Musically, Rush experiments here with acoustic sounds and that keeps us interested, but the lyrics aren't very arresting and Geddy's delivery has become strained.  Spots of brilliance as usual, but goes over too smooth for me. Maybe another dozen listens would make me like this song more.  Maybe.<br /><br />Good News First - The signature Rush sound.  This song sounds like they could play it in their sleep without a mistake.  Do not like the way Geddy is trying to sing here.Doesn't sound good. Hmmmmmmmm.<br /><br />Malignant Narcissism -  Instrumental #3?  What the hell is going on here?  Have we lost our minds?  We have, but in a good way.  There is nothing better than listening to Alex, Geddy & Neil in full-tilt jam mode!  This song shows us some chops and we appreciate that.  Closer to YYZ than any of the other instrumentals with its steady pound and bass, drum & guitar blurbs.  Excellent!<br /><br />We Hold On - Cool, kinda trippy sound.  Nice chorus.  Hook?  Maybe just a little one, but it's enough to make this song stand out against the flow of Snakes & Arrows.  Makes me want to hear it again.<br /><br />Overall, what you can take from Snakes & Arrows is that Rush actually had fun making this album together and did in fact record many parts in the studio as a unit, where in the past they had done most of the recording individually.  You can feel that vibe on the album that there was a definite sense of ease to the approach in which these songs were devised and that is a good thing.  There is a freer, lest-structured approach that adds some freshness to the Rush way of doing things.  Hearing three instrumentals on one single Rush abum alone tells us that the trio were jamming together and jamming well.  Some songs blend and that is something to expect as the fat and flab of age and familiarity have come to rest upon Rush, but the music is clever and inspired and perfect as usual.  Not Moving Pictures.  But we understand that.  Still a very powerful outing and well worth the coin.<br /><br />Dig it!What the hell is going on here?  Have we lost our minds?

B000HCO840|5.0|Having avoided it in theatres because of Brett Ratner's involvement (you have to admit, after the lifeless Rush Hour 2 and Red Dragon, what were the odds on Ratner being able to do anything right?), usually the guarantee of lazy paint-by-numbers filmmaking at best, to my very great surprise the much-troubled X-Men: The Last Stand turned out to actually be good - very good - with Ratner for once putting a little effort into proceedings in a film that's far more successful than Bryan Singer's take on Supes and has all the excitement and emotional power that film lacked.     It helps that Singer established the emotional background strongly enough in the first two films for Ratner to be able to just get on with telling a story (I do wonder how well it would work for a newcomer to the franchise with no prior investment in the characters), and there's still a part of me that figures that Singer and Matthew Vaughn spent so long in pre-production before leaving the film that the action sequences were probably fairly comprehensively storyboarded before Ratner came aboard because there's none of his customary just-point-the-camera-in-the-general-direction laziness, but I still have to give Mr I-don't-like-action-it-bores-the-audience credit where credit is due for not screwing it up - the big set-pieces are genuinely impressive, and this is a cracking yarn that rarely lets up. He even gets something like a performance out of Halle Berry, which is more than Singer ever managed. Shame about the terrible CGI make-up effects that make the `younger' Patrick Stewart look like a Final Fantasy character in the prologue though.     Although some found the film a little too short, after looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD, I'm not really sure if it is that possible to extend the movie without going the Spiderman 2.1 route and filming new scenes - most of them are alternate bet-hedging versions of scenes in the film (like the Rogue cured/not cured variations). But it's pretty rareto see a blockbuster people would actually like to be longer these days!

1593082037|4.0|For collectors:  Barnes & Noble put out three series of hardcover \\"Barnes & Noble Classics\\" in the last decade.  The first has yellow dust jackets (1992), the second has all black matte dust jackets with gold type and a diamond-design (1997), and the third in 2003 has black-spines with a literary picture on the top of the spine.  This edition is the third kind (2003).  It has a black silhouette of a detective on a blue background.  The book is a regular trade-sized hardback book.  It is held together with glue that makes crispy crackling noises when you open it.  Normally, I'd love that, but with a book that is well over 700 pages, I worry about the quality and hope that the pages manage to stay in the spine.  The edges of the pages are the \\"rough cut\\" kind, which is quite charming, even when you're picking the machine-leavings off the side of the book.  The text size is readable, which is to say, it's not 8-point font.  I'd say more 10 to 11 point.<br /><br />However, if you're looking at this edition, you're looking at it because it's cheap, not because it's superb quality.  And boy, at $9.95 list price for a 709-page book, you are getting a deal.<br /><br />It looks quite nice on a bookshelf and the extraneous notes within are as listed: a short (short) timeline of Conan Doyle's life, a rather brief introduction to Sherlock Holmes, a page on \\"Conveyances (Modes of Transportation),\\" and a few notations in the back.  But if you're like me, you're going to initially skip all of that babble for the substance.  In this book, you will get: \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" \\"The Sign of Four,\\" \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" and \\"The Memoir of Sherlock Holmes.\\"  If you purchase this volume, it would be wise to buy the matching volume of \\"The Complete Sherlock Holmes, Volume II.\\"  Worth it and recommendable?  Yes, absolutely.
0895260131|5.0|It is always dangerous and often misleading to totally identify individuals with the background they are raised against. Within every human group, be it a small tribe or a large civilization, there are factions, different points of view, etc. But it is clearly a fact that one's environment -physical as well as cultural- has an impact on one's view of life and the world. Islam has had many different expressions throughout its history, but certainly it has had also a tight guideline in the form of the Koran and the teachings of Muhammad, a sinister figure whose biography is most revealing about the character of the religion he singlehandedly founded. Now, how can you tell if and when a cultural aggregate of teachings is \\"superior\\" over others? The answer is hard to find looking at their intrinsic merits: what they say. But it is easier when one looks at the concrete results that cultural aggregate, in this case a religion, has brought upon its followers. And the case is, the civilizations that sprung from Christianity have done much better than those brought about by Islam. And let me say that I am no practitioner of any religion. My view results from a simple observation of the economic, political and social conditions of each. While it is very true that Christianity has also turned out to be bigot, violent, cruel, and opressive, one trait distinguishes it from Islam: change. At the time of Reformation, Catholicism, the dominant form of Christianity, had become a paralyzing force, even a retrograde one. The Reformation liberated people and ideas from the tight grasp of the Church, and opened a path for continual change. Even the Catholic Church, in spite of itself, has developed into something different and necessarily more -if not totally- atuned to social, economic and technological advances. Not so the case with Islam, which has stagnated and even retreated in ideological terms. Bernard Lewis, one of the leading scholars on Islam, has a very good and slim book entitled precisely: \\"What went wrong?\\", where he explained the historical situations that led to stagnation.  <br /> <br />In this timely and assertive book, Robert Spencer dispels many clouds and goes back to explaining why and how it is that Islam is NOT a religion of peace and tolerance, but much the other way around. And of course that is not to say that every Muslim is a destructive individual, but only that the framework of thought within which they operate is conducive to intolerance, stagnation, dependence and well, as the meaning of Islam declares it: \\"Islam\\" means \\"submission\\".  <br /> <br />It is not to be bigot to acknowledge that there is something very wrong with Islam itself, and that the Christian world has developed into a largely secular, free, prosperous arena for the individual. The Renaissance, the Reformation, Illustration, etc., gave way to a civilization where debate and dissent were not only permitted, but also encouraged. Islam never experienced similar conditions. Hatred, envy, desperation, characterize today all of Islam's teachings and messages. Spencer quotes many instances where Islam is revealed as a religion of backwardness and bigotry. Facts are facts. Oh, and had it not been for the Crusades, a defensive strategy aimed at recovering the old theatre of Jewish, Hellenistic, and Christian cultures, violently subdued by Islam, the siege of Vienna would have taken place centuries before it did, in 1683. It would have taken place before Europe had professional armies, and today we would not visit Paris and its grand mosque.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Forget Freddie or Ring Two, this is the scariest film you will ever watch.  Global warming confused me until my daughter did a paper on it for a college course.  As I was reading through her source books, I began to see how this thing is happening.   <br /> <br />Al Gore makes an intelligent yet entertaining guide.  Perhaps if he had been as witty during his campaign for President, the election might have turned out differently.  Still maybe his real purpose in life is to bring the threat of global warming to our attention in a way which can be easily watched and absorbed. <br /> <br />Gore and Laurie David deserve the kudos they have received and I am glad they won the Oscar as it brought this film to the attention of the public at large. <br /> <br />This is an important film on an important subject and it should be shown wherever possible.  One indication of how important it is is that the segment which doesn't want to talk about global warming is attacking Gore's lifestyle.  My only admonition to these people is that they check the log in their own eye before they begin condemning him for the sliver in his(Quote from the New Testament).
0143038419|4.0|Gilbert's book is fast-paced and delightfully written.  Having been to Italy, India, and Indonesia, I appreciate her descriptions of these fascinating cultures.  More importantly, I enjoy Gilbert's self-exploration even more than her global travels.  In the book, she unflinchingly examines her motives and actions.  I wouldn't have necessarily reached all of the same conclusions, but I understand Gilbert's thought process and admire her willingness to be authentic.
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|I fell in love with this movie after only seeing it once and knew I had to have this CD.  It's got all the big songs on it including full versions of songs that you only hear either mentioned in the movie (such as \\"Entering Bootytown\\") or only heard briefly (like \\"Slam\\").  Two songs that have no part of the movie were also inserted and one of them I liked very much and the other I did not care for, they're a matter of personal taste.  The only main difference between the songs sung in the movie and the ones on this CD is on the \\"Way Back Into Love (Demo)\\" because in the movie the song is not complete until the end whereas they sing it in its entirety on the CD.  But that certainly doesn't ruin anything.  If you loved, liked or even just enjoyed the movie (especially those of us who fondly recall the music of the 80's) then you will enjoy this CD as well.  I definitely recommend it.

B00005JPPL|2.0|Cris Johnson can see the future!  Two minutes from now.  And only if it involves him.  Unless you're talking about a hot blonde chick named Liz, in which case, all bets are off!<br /><br />Speaking of betting.  There's a very cleverly done scene in \\"Next,\\" where Johnson is winning a little too well at a blackjack table.  The guys with eyes in the sky send some goons down to muscle the prognosticating Johnson into the backroom, but he spends the next ten minutes ducking, dodging, spinning, and weaving through the casino with the casual elegance of a man who knows exactly where all of his pursuers will be at all times.  It's fun to watch, but there's also no real point to it.<br /><br />Starring Nicolas Cage (one of my favorite guilty pleasures) and a taking-it-waaaay-too-seriously Julianne Moore (as the bullheaded FBI agent Callie Ferris), \\"Next\\" is nothing but a premise on a platter.  Pretty much every scene that's even remotely engaging involves Cage dodging giant logs, winning fights without throwing a punch, or thoroughly searching three factory floors without ever taking a step.  I'll admit, it's cool, but it's also the same \\"cool,\\" over and over again.<br /><br />But there's a lot here that's not that cool.  Like the you-gotta-be-kidding-me love story.  Or the cheesy Russian villains.  Or Cage's hairdo.  (First [[ASIN:B000OVLBEO Ghost Rider]] and now this.  What, these films can't afford hair stylists?  The poor guy looks like he's wearing a hood without the sweatshirt.)<br /><br />But the biggest not-cool of them all, and the reason I dropped my rating down to two stars, is the flatline of a finish, a pathetic wrap-up that, quite literally, gives one the impression that they have just watched a movie that was never meant to be finished.  It's one thing to give an audience a gimmicky premise and, for emotional resonance, attach the threat of a nuclear bomb (who ISN'T afraid of those things?).  It's another thing to take all of that resonance (what little there is) and trash it for one last play on the gimmick.  It may be hard to believe, but this flick has no resolution, has no ending, and nothing is solved.<br /><br />I wondered, walking out of the theatre, why I didn't see it coming.e there is) and trash it for one last play on the gimmick.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|This one really helps you save a lot of money, space, and your time.  I used three of them at a dental office.  It gives much flexibility by raising the screen when the dentist is standing or pull the screen closer to the patient's chair.  It also saves space too, because I can use the space below the screen I was able to use that space for a keyboard which is used not very often, eventually I can fit all the computer components in a much smaller desk.  Also I have tried this for a 22 inch LCD monitor, it still can handle this weight.  The price is reasonable, and it has other accessories to fit the system in different deskboards.  You don't really worry about whether your LCD or Desk can fit into it.
B000687M48|5.0|I love the DVD that is in this package!  I've watched it about 7 times. I also have seen Evanescense in concert and the DVD captures the style, energy, and performance techniques of Amy Lee and her group superbly.  So if you can't see Evanscense in Concert, this DVD is a great substitute. HOWEVER, AMY LEE SINGS IN A LOWER/DEEPER TONE THAN USUAL IN SOME OF THE SONGS, ON THIS DVD, THAN WHAT SHE USES IN THE STUDIO RELEASE OF \\"FALLEN\\" AND OF WHAT I HEARD HER USE IN CONCERT. The included CD in the package is the sound track of the concert so Amy's voice is a lower, deeper tone than what she uses in the studio release of \\"Fallen\\" on some songs (particularly 'Going Under'). (NOTE: This DVD/CD was made before the release of \\"The Open Door\\" so you will not hear or see anything from \\"The Open Door\\"). I enjoy watching the DVD everytime I do, but Amy's voice is rather deep on some song tracks.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is a very natural talent. By that I mean you dont hear alot of techno assistance either in her voice or the instruments used.

B000OVLBEO|4.0|Let me first say that I am an LONG time fan of ol' Flamehead.  That being said, I was slightly dissapointed in this movie. <br />Was it cool to see my FAVORITE hero on the big screen?  Oh, yeah!   <br />Did Johnson make another Daredevil?  Thank god he didn't. <br /> <br />In fact, Johnson did a GREAT job bringing the GR mythos together.  I mean, the John Blaze era didn't exactly have the greatest continuity and that's exactly what Johnson brought to this movie.  He tied it all together, if only by inventing a few new mythos of his own (i.e. the \\"devil's bounty hunter\\" thing. <br /> <br />The FX are AWESOME!  Ghost Rider has never looked better.  The only weak point is that Johnson makes the Spirit of Vengeance seem like a lumbering juggernaut.  Not that he was weak in the comics (far from it), but Johnson just didn't have him getting into the knock-down-drag-out brawls that made GR so cool in the comics. <br /> <br />All in all, it isn't a bad movie.  Ok for SOV noobs and a must have for old school riders alike. <br /> <br />Oh, yeah...  Coolest cameo ever:  Peter Fonda as Mephisto.  Great scene when he sees Blaze's bike and says, \\"Nice bike\\".  It's cool because, aside from the paint job, the bike is a virtual clone of the one Fonda rode in Easy Rider.

This season is of course nothing short of excellent, the first six episodes are almost like a Lost mini-series, with the ending being one of the best climatic cliffhangers ever, and the seventh episode comes back with a vengeance which blasts off the rest of the season. If season one was survival and season two was the hatch then season three is exploration. And if you thought the season opener for season two was insane you haven't seen anything yet! You haven't already watched Lost on TV and are planning on waiting for the DVD and watching it straight through you are really lucky, thats the way to do it, personally I'm too addicted to do it.  <br />Favorite episodes include  <br />Enter 77 <br />Not in Portland <br />Flashes Before My Eyes <br />One Of Us <br />The Brig <br />
1400079179|1.0|This book is every bit as awful as its most perceptive critics say. The prose reads as if extracted from a trash compactor in which an average thriller, a volume of pseudo-intellectual art history and a tourist guidebook to Paris and London have been mashed together. This is the 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' of 'intellectual' thrillers. All those millions who bought this book must be reading for laughs.\\"
B000002KIK|2.0|Technical Ecstasy was a grim hint of things to come if Sabbath didn't pull out of their tailspin.  Unfortunately they didn't nor did they decide to call it a day before releasing the ill-fated Never Say Die.  It's an ironic and sad end to the original lineup of a band that was the benchmark for an entire genre of music and who inspired countless bands that took their vision to the next level and beyond.  Granted, it has its moments.  The title track is the most engaging song on it, followed by A Hard Road and perhaps Johnny Blade.  The overall flavor of the album, however, is one of contention and misery.  Compared to everything that came before it, Never Say Die is uninspired, directionless, and difficult to enjoy given their auspicious history.  If you're a diehard fan, there's probably enough here to make it worth the purchase.  If you want to remember Ozzy's tour with Sabbath in a more charitable light, consider Sabotage or, if you're feeling generous, Technical Ecstasy their last album and leave this one in the cutout bin.

B000O174CM|3.0|I agree with Diana Ross how they change the movie enough so they don't have to pay her. I could see watching the movie that it definetly referred to The Supremes, like when the record covers came across the screen with the same layouts, and how it went from the Dreametts to the Dreams (think Primettes to Supremes). Also little \\"Michael Jackson\\" waiting outside the door for Deena \\"Diana\\" etc. I think the music sucked.
B000066C6F|5.0|This movie is really good. First off, I am a fan of John Travolta and Jamie Lee Curtis, and upon finishing this movie for the first time, I felt that they work well together. Jamie shows off her killer bod in many scenes throughout, and can really motivate you to work out yourself. It's got a good meaning to the storyline. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with upbeat 80's hits, which makes the movie even better. I could relate with Jamie Lee's character, Jessie, because she likes to be perfect, in everything she does. \\"What's wrong with wanting to be the best that you can be? What's so wrong with wanting to be perfect?\\" is a famous line of Jessie. It's one of my favorite quotes -- and, really, what IS so wrong with wanting to be the best that you can be? Check it out. Some scenes I would label \\"iffy\\" (i.e. the strip tease scene), but overall the movie is great.
0374105235|4.0|This memoir was heartbreaking.  We cannot ignore the message presented here that our world has become even more  violent and the exploitation of children is truly frightening.  Mr. Beah has emerged victorious, however, what about the thousands of other young people who are still in the clutches of absolute evil?  They have been robbed of the gift of a happy childhood.  What becomes of them afterwards?  An unsettling message with far-reaching consequences.  Our world is not so large that we can afford to ignore what is happening as we speak.  A must-read.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. My mother first heard about it on Oprah, and then ordered the DVD. When it arrived, she watched it several times, all the while begging me to watch it. I did, and could understand her excitement with it. It's got to be one of the most powerful, if not THE most powerful, tools for your life. I love how it is presented, and how everything is worded. It makes you stop and think, \\"I knew this, but I didn't *know* I knew this.\\" It's about the Law of Attraction, and how you attract everything into your life: Good, bad, you name it. I couldn't understand how I would be in dead-end relationships that tore me down and brought out the worst in me, how the \\"hits\\" just kept on coming (i.e. car accident, death of a family member, falling out with close friends, etc). I didn't realize that the way I *thought* about things were actually coming true! Being a pessimist was never any fun, and my life was always drab and full of drama -- the not-so-good kind. My life was changed the moment I pushed play on the DVD player. I am now a full-time optimist, and my life has never been better. If you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right. That's why it's so important to *believe* that you can get whatever you want in life! Because with this knowledge, you *CAN*. The Secret comes as a DVD and also a book. I own the book, but haven't found time to read it yet. The DVD is very powerful, as I'm sure the book is too.

B000N6TX22|5.0|My current setup (thanks to my roommate) is a 52' 1080p Sony Bravia and a 6.1  surround sound setup. This movie puts the system through its paces in both visuals and audio. It is a great movie full of metaphor and not at all what it seems to be on the surface.<br /><br />The DVD is full of extras such as 'the making of' some of the subtle yet perfectly executed special effects and a whole documentary on the politics and philosophy of the movie.<br /><br />Overall a great buy!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Without a doubt, \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is Michael Buble's greatest album so far. I cannot fathom how a person can take a song and inject so much emotion into every note of melody and every syllable of lyric. His take on \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" is masterful, and \\"I'm Your Man\\" exudes so much vulnerablility, it is almost unnerving. \\"Everything\\" is very light, but sweet and entertaining at the same time.  The Sinatra classics are expertly recreated, and it is obvious that Buble has the utmost respect for a great legend.  In my opinion, Michael Buble is destined to be a legend as well.  Anyone who can make a Willie Nelson standard (\\"Always On My Mind\\") tolerable is nothing short of a musical genius!  If you enjoy music that evokes emotion and can still give you a fun ride, you must get this CD!!! You will not be disappointed!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Did I want to know what An Inconvenient Truth forced me to know, that: the USian way and the world's way of living violate the needs of nerve, muscle, and mind, as well as the needs of sustainability. <br /> <br />I want so much to believe that we can all go on consuming, aquiring, wasting and that like the buffalo the planets resources are inexhaustable. <br /> <br />I also want the truth, even when I don't like it. Not listening means more war, more famine, and gasp! Higher gas prices for all. <br /> <br />What Al Gore says is verifiable, his conclusions are difficult to refute, and his presentation is excellent. <br /> <br />Buy it, share it, act to cut down energy use. <br />
0805047905|5.0|I'm not sure what it is about this book, but my 13 month old daughter is in love with this book.  We read it over and over.  It was recommended to me by Amazon and I'm so glad we bought it.  Teaches animals, colors, etc.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Fantastic! it came in a gorgeous red box - it was a gret gift!
0783230079|4.0|This movie is a must for any Downey fan.  It has a little of everything comedy, drama, and romance.  The story is basically about 4 individuals all killed while on the same bus.  Their souls are connected to the nearest baby being born(downey's character).  The little boy grows up having \\"imaginary friends\\".  Of course, once he's in school this poses a problem for him.  He's seen talking to himself, etc. His school begins to think he's in need of therapy.  The souls do the selfless thing and disappear(though they are still with him).  The man he becomes is a bit of a jerk.  Eventually the souls reveal themselves when they find out that he is their corporeal being to be used to tie up their loose ends here on earth.  Along the way Downey's character learns a few lessons and becomes a better person for it. <br />
1582701709|5.0|I had to purchase this item in a store since I never received it from amazon.  I purchased a CD (which I did receive) but never received the book or the DVD.  Can anyone find a phone number to find out where the shipment is??????? No you can't because there is no number.  My card has been charged for the item, however, I never received it.  The CD is excellent and the book I ended up purchasing at the store is excellent.  Still waiting for the DVD that was purchased on 3/20/07 and today is May 6/07.  Lets see if amazon will print this review.  I doubt it and I will never use amazon in the future since they charge but won't ship the product.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|This album is amazing.  It rocks just right.  In a world where the air waves are dominated by thoughtless, brain dumbing music such as Hinder, Buckcherry, Papa Roach, and other bands that lower The Standards and won't quit crapping into our ears, it is good to know we can crack a Cold One and enjoy something as unique and rocking as From Beale Street to Oblivion.  As soon as my stereo began to play it a big bushy beard suddenly sprouted from my face and immediatly went up in flames, and my soul slammed itself around within my body.  That's what happens when one listens to Clutch, and it is what should happen when one is rocked properly.  Have a good day.
0393327655|2.0|The main problem I had with Mr.Harris' argument was he presented a case for reason displacing faith. But then toward the end of the book, he did an 180 degree about face, and undermined his whole argument by embracing the subjective nature of Eastern mysticism. In contrast, at least the Judeo/Christian concept of the divine is rooted within the context of an objective historical framework, while the nature of Eastern beliefs are subjective with no point of historical reference. The texts of Eastern belief systems are highly mythologized, while the Western canon has historical footprints that can substantiated by archaeology. However, this is not an apolegetic for C.S. Lewis' contention that the final conflict will be between west and east, Christianity and Hinduism. Hardly, history and current events have demonstrated that the bloodiest conflicts have been between rival monotheistic faiths in the western world. And unless we reach an understanding, we will destroy ourselves in the process. And Mr. Harris adequately adresses these concerns. And to the chagrin of Christian apologists, he adequately presents a case that dictatorial systems of the twentieth century were not \\"godless\\" systems responsible for mass atrocities, but in reality a reworking of messianic themes with new faces. <br /> <br />However, it is embracing certainty that creates intolerance, and it is the people who react with absolute certainty who create all the evil done in the name of religion. But on the other hand, absolute certainty also serves to illuminate the illogical nature of the atheist's contentions.In fact, it is vastly more difficult to prove an absolute negation, than the fact that something or someone exists. In short, one would have to be God in order to disprove God. One would have to be everywhere omnipresent in the universe in order to prove that such a being does not exist. Therefore, atheism is the most illogical and highest indefensible position. But on the other hand, while Ibelieve there are evidences for faith, and good arguments can be made by the religious apologist, it is also true that the nature of faith itself necessitates no absolute proof. In essence, it all goes back to Kierkegaard's existential \\"leap of faith\\". The believer must first make that initial \\"leap of faith\\", and then begin to gather evidence for faith, but the same can be said of the \\"born again atheist\\". Therefore, absolute certainty on both counts displays a lack of reason, and we must therefore embrace that element of agnosticism. Indeed it has been demonstrated that \\"a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing\\", and those who continue to learn continue to discover how much they really don't know. Therefore, a spirit of charity, civility, compromise and open-mindedness must be our disposition no matter where we lie in the spectrum of belief. <br /> <br />And while I believe Mr. Harris' book is a helpful contribution in the ongoing dialogue, the fact remains that toward the end of the book he undermines his whole argument. He starts out arguing for the primacy of reason, and then does an about face and starts tripping out on Eastern mind trips and \\"touchy-feely\\" subjectivism. Therefore, my question is, What's next for Mr. Harris? LSD or Peyote induced trips in the desert? Floatation tanks and astral projection? Mr. Harris should go back to Haight-Ashbury with Timothy Leary (in spirit of course), and leave the arguments to the \\"single- minded\\" proponents of reason.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Absolutely delightful for my just-turned 3 year old daughter.  She knows all of the songs and we sometimes just watch the feature which allows you to just play the songs... <br />I loved this movie as a child and I now really enjoy the movie on a different level as an adult.  A classic and must-have in a child's dvd library!
1582701709|5.0|Shhhh..... (It is a secret) !      It is a keeper, a great fabulous book!
B000N4SHPS|4.0|this was a better way to end the rocky series.it blows away rocky 5.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|This movie was plodding and I had to force myself to get through it, hoping for the payoff at the end where everything fell into place. It didn't. Good acting, but not worth the time.
0930289234|5.0|I've never read a book that delves so deeply into the minds and emotions of its characters.  It was nice to take a little break at the end of each chapter to read the small passage from a book or an article.  Moore really does a great job letting the mystery of the Comedian's death unfold little by little, while getting us to  know the characters so deeply at the same time.  All in all, a great read.
0374105235|5.0|A great book that clearly illustrates the struggle children face with regards to the various wars in Africa. It is well-written making it an easy, fast read.
B000EHSVOG|4.0|I loved this movie! Every member of the cast is in the right place here and it makes this film one of the big classics.
1400082773|5.0|Barack Obama is a shining Light in our modern World, a Man for All Seasons, one capable of bridging the apparent gaps between different groups in the United States.  He is telling us from the heart how his life was like growing up and how he became the shining light we see now. <br />A great, easy to read book, essential reading for all who are truly interested in knowing more about who our candidates for President really are. <br />Very inspiring!  A must read!
1594200823|5.0|A very detailed journey through the procedures of growing and processing our foods. It leaves little or nothing to the imagination. Neither inorganic nor organic processes get off without an indepth critical report of their inadequacies. Whether it's corn or chicken, recent industrialization has made these foods highly suspect in their nutritional value. Pollan has tried very hard to be objective and fair. It's not a pretty picture he gives us but it is one we should all be aware of.
0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama is a beautiful writer, and he writes from the heart, and from a brilliant well trained mind.  He shows us how he plans to make his dreams for America come true.  Most inspiring and interesting, and finally we meet someone who will actually do it!  He will accomplish a reunification of Americans and will inspire the World to again respect and love the United States and all that we stand for!  He can and will do it!  Well done, Barack Obama!
B00004R9A4|5.0|Adding to my collection of Disney and upgrading at the same time.
067003830X|4.0|I read this book in just a few sittings, not for the lack of interest - just lots going on in my life at the moment! It was well worth the read flowing easily, written from the first person perspective of one who is fascinated by the changes that are possible in our brains. <br /> <br />Details of several people's journeys into understanding that neuroplasticity occurs, and finding ways to drive it in particular directions was compassionately and enthusiastically described. <br /> <br />Personally, I would have liked more details of assessment of just what had gone wrong and finding ways to target 'neurobic' exercise for the brain/mind. It would then have been more directly applicable to my work as a chiropractor with a special interest in functional neurology. However, for those learning more about just what is possible in brain training and recovery this is a wonderful read.
630471193X|5.0|Another outstanding movie with John Travolta.  Such a romance.  John stretched for this role and pulled it off with flying colors.  His costars were perfect too.
0385508476|5.0|I regard this book as an important addition to my collection of books written by and about Anne Frank.  It is for study, rather than for casual reading.  The front section of the book contains lots of information about the diary and how it was determined to be authentic.  The back section compares three different versions/translations of the diary, page by page.  The book contains all of the writings of Anne Frank in one volume.
B000F8O35U|5.0|An upgrade to DVD.  Wonderful movie to watch, beautiful coloring and music.  Ariel can sing the pants off a crab.
0757302661|5.0|This book is designed for all those expectant mothers who deeply feel that the natural birth is instinctive for mother and baby.  It's simple technique of relaxing, staying calm and deep breathing will bring about a calm and happy birth day.  Unfortunately, modern medicine has moved far away from the natural birthing method and this book reasserts what women instinctively know, that to trust and follow their natural body rhythm, trust our maternal instincts believe in our bodies and then we can all have a safer and calmer birth with minimal intervention. <br /> <br />Before I read this book I truely believed there was a better way of giving birth that was pain free and this book confirms my femanine instinct.  A must for all expectant mothers.
0790737345|5.0|this is a great movie, a must have.  Beautiful music.  Two wonderful actors with very expressive eyes.  upgrade to DVD
1401207138|3.0|I sprung for the \\"Absolute\\" edition because of all the great reviews I've read/heard over the years. But sadly, I was disappointed by Watchmen. Maybe in its day it was revolutionary and unique, but it hasn't stood the test of time for me. I'll stick with V For Vendetta- a true classic.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Absolutely darling.  A great movie for the kids to learn about peer pressure to look and act a certain way.  It also defines change, sometimes it takes something different to continue on.
B000NA28I4|4.0|Some have criticized the movie as not sticking strictly to the book.  This is impossible when turning a great series (sofar) into a movie.  The movie was definitely worth the purchase and view (more than once).  Can't wait til the 3rd book & 2nd movie come out!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Wonderful movie, even better on DVD.  Just a little bit of sugar helps the medicine go down.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Happy Feet made me happy to watch it. It teaches self-esteem in a unique way.
B00001QEE8|5.0|A Disney classic on DVD, what more could you want.  Beautiful colors, wonderful music and an enchanting tale of boy cub raised in the jungle.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This film really took my husband and I through the holiday that the two women experienced.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Disney, Disney, Disney how do you change a classic?  Upgrade to DVD.
074356619X|5.0|This item is very well produced and packaged, however it won't change your life,it's not magic, although, there are some great words of wisdom and good advice....but it is not a magic cure pill to change your life....That is up to you and the secret, well, it just reminds you of that.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|...friends and family of Elliott for putting out these b-sides and previously unreleased songs.  I already knew a few of the songs, (like the alternate versions of his Heatmiser songs, the other take of \\"Miss Misery\\" and \\"Thirteen\\") and the rest are already growing on me.  However, there are still plenty of songs left in Elliott's canon that have yet to see the light of day (on an official album), such as his collaboration with Jon Brion.  But this only leaves hope for future b-side compilations.  Even after the man dies, his music lives on.
B000O75F7C|5.0|This is easily the best album of the year, and in my opinion the best album of the last several years. <br /> <br />This is also my favorite Porcupine Tree album to date. They have continued to evolve and move into new territory and this album, to me, represents their fullest, lushest, most coherent piece of work. <br /> <br />I own the limited edition DVD audio version of Fear of a Blank Planet and it has the most spectacular 5.1 mix of anything that I have heard, including the Tree's previous award winning 5.1 mixed albums. I genuinely feel sorry for anyone who wasn't able to get their hands on the limited edition because it seems that the music on this album was really created to be played in 5.1 (here's to hoping that they will put out a non-limited DVD-A version). <br /> <br />
B00005JPO8|5.0|The film is excellent regarding the direction, the acting and the story and presents the corrupted East German state in all its viciousness and paranoia just a few years before it fell crushing down. A Stasi captain who is regarded an exemplary officer in his service undertakes a mission which will bring him face to face with his innermost fears and doubts. He is the hand of God personified in that police state, but he chooses to fight his inner and very personal war regardless of the cost. The tragic finale is very moving, as is also the way that director Dreyman chooses to express his gratitude to his improbable benefactor.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was one of the better epic stories that I have watched.  It was disapointing to reach the end because the men had become so familiar I feel they are friends.  In a true sence, they are, considering what they did for our current freedom.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Some may wonder at my title.  To them a perfect adaption might mean it's exactly the same as the stage musical, which this certainly is not.  But when I say a perfect adaption I mean they took the stage show and re-molded it into what works best for film.  The changes some people criticize make sense when you think of the differences in telling a story on the stage or in a film. <br /> <br />The cast is well put together.  People complain about the lack of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, but I disagree.  Gerard Butler does not have Crawford's voice, but I think he brings more raw emotion to the role.  Under the scrutiny of the camera, this to me is a more believable Phantom.  And forgive me for saying this but I would never have wanted to see Sarah Brightman in this film.  She was great in the broadway recording, but a few years ago she sang in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 50th Birthday Concert, and something about her performance made me cringe.  Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice and brought the perfect innocence to the role. <br /> <br />Extras in this 2-disk edition are nice, particularly an extensive documentary on the creation of the original stage show.  I highly reccomend this DVD
B0002ZMITY|5.0|Hilarious and corny. From the genius who created Borat. Ali G!!! <br /> <br />Big-it up.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|I see if this movie turns up as kind of a flop, the extended version has to be released even though the director had to show us the version we see now.  He did the same thing with DAredevil.  Lets hope that the extended version is better.  oh I liked the movie but it could have better.
B000I5XDXS|3.0|I liked the concert a lot.....just expected much better sound...have several other concerts not on blu-ray that sound much better...sounds like there are microfones....3 ft away taking the audio....well at least thats what I felt.....
B00005U122|5.0|It is a pretty decent concert- sound and video pretty good- its a keeper
B00006WUWQ|5.0|I love the austin powers series of movies. Worth the price tag. Buy it.
B00008EY5W|4.0|I am not sure if the \\"superbit\\" version is any better, but I like the movie anyway.
B00005JPFH|5.0|i must say spider-man 3 was awesome the first time i seen it. i mean i heard people cried when it was over. cant say i blame them, all three films were greatly casted, especially this one. i read one reviewer talkin about it being too much cramed with everything. well, its because its the end of this trilogy, and they wanted to tie up this one up to the previous two and get things over with. i really liked the villains in this film, especially venom. i can only hope that tobey maguire and sam raimi consider doin more spider-man films together. theres still so many stories and characters im hoping to see on the big screen. especially seeing spidey get in a fight with the black cat and teaming up with her vs. another villain. anyways, cant wait for the dvd.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|My first album was Fly by Night- purchased in 1975. A devoted fan since then- and I've been attracted to this band as much by their integrity as their music.  <br /> <br />Not much to add to the many insightful reviews here. I think Rush should attempt either an instrumental album- or go for broke on some radically new music. This album is quite different- but not in a radical, satisfying manner. Geddy sticks to his formulaic vocals - He's been in the same zone for years and needs to break out- or give more space to the instruments. <br /> <br />Everyone knows these guys are capable of unparalleled melody and musicianship. But they have ben playing it \\"safe.\\"  There is no spine-tingling music here- no obviously catchy Lifeson solos or Peart drums. Not a huge complaint -I still enjoy the music- I just wouldn't classify it as \\"creative.\\"  <br /> <br />I think the best trio in history has mellowed with age. Must admit I'm much more excited by groups like Porcupine Tree now-  and while their musicianship is not on par with Rush (purposely or not) they *sound* more creative and impressive.  <br /> <br />But Rush will always be Number 1 in my pantheon of rock music.
B00005NKKV|5.0|This album lacked the self-aggrandazing bombast of 'Bridge Over Trouble Water' (which I hold was a little too comfortable with its brilliance, although with a touch more humility than the Beatles Sgt. Pepper), but more importantly, I don't see it as a rawer sketch of Bridge Over Troubled Water of the work Simon and Garfunkel produced in between, but I believe this IS their definitive statement, their magnum opus. What I like most is Simon's atatention to melody and music AS well as the lyrics. It did not revel in its own lyrical cleverness like Dylan, yet the lyric messages were poignant and well developed and despite the simplicity never lacked thematic depth. So redolent of the times, this was a coherently brilliantly album that shoots through the mush of drab 'folk rock' clones like a flashlight in the dark.
0380807343|4.0|I love Neil Gaiman, I love children's stories and I love things with a touch of creepiness and this delivered!  I picked this up at a bookstore on a whim and read through it in almost one sitting.  A great tale of otherworldly creepiness about a little girl who goes through a strange adventure and in the end appreciates the parents she slightly took for granted.  Kind of reminds me of tales like Alice and Wonderland, Labrynth, Spirited Away, etc. <br /> <br />I think this would also be great to read to children about 11 and up or so, assuming they can handle the creepy images. I actually found the pictures even scarier than the story!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|First let me say that my favorite RUSH album of all time is Power Windows.  Followed closely by Signals and then Grace Under Pressure.  Rush fans all have their favorite time periods so I thought before I write comments on the new album you should understand my preferences. <br />Having said that...I love this album but it took a number of listens before I really appreciated it.  Far Cry, The Larger Bowl and Malignant Narcissism were instant favorites.  But the rest of the songs were so overwhelming musically that I couldn't wrap my head (or ears) around them immediately.  But given time I fell in love with every song.  This is definitely the best produced record they've ever released.  If you go back and listen to any other RUSH album after listening to S&A the sound is not even close in terms of fullness and richness.   <br />This album is like a fine wine...at first taste your unsuspecting tongue will be overwhelmed and miss the complexities of the taste.  However, after a few more sips the wine will release its many textures and flavors. <br />I can't wait to hear the songs performed live. <br />Cheers!
1582701709|5.0|I think you have to have an open mind and a positive attitude to accept the idea of this book.  I believe those who are so critical are either cynics or lacking in spirit.  As I read this book, I was constantly recalling times when I had applied the principals of the secret in my own life and remembering how it produced a positive outcome.  The Secret provided me with a greater awareness of the power of positive thinking and proof that is has been a powerful tool throughout history.  I love everything about this book; the quotations, the cover, the design of the pages and the content.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Product was impeccably packed, arrive in good time and this edition is a wonderful trip back to the simpler times. My children loved the original movie and now my grandson wants to watch it every movie night. The addition clips just make this more fun and every time we see something we missed. They are a wonderfully funny group and a must own for all the \\"MPF Circus\\" heads.
B00005ATZT|5.0|I rec'd the dvd in a timely manner and in good condition. Thanks!
0596009208|5.0|I was surprised at how well this book kept my attention. This is the only programming book I've ever read cover-to-cover without falling asleep. Not even once. This book is very easy to follow and understand. No need to re-read sections. Everything seems to somehow \\"stick\\" just like the book advertises. I would highly recommend this book to anyone needing to learn Java. Be advised though that there is no such thing as a \\"cureall\\" book. You will need other texts after this one. But I will say that this should definitely be your first book whether you are a complete beginner or a seasoned professional starting a new language. You won't be dissapointed.
0896760839|5.0|This book is a must have for any re-enactor making their own clothing.  I have been searching for a book with this much detail for quite awhile and I am very pleased with this book.
0440237688|2.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  A quick read but you can't put it down anyway.  It is fairy-tale, Brave New World re-visited, and profound moral proclamation all in one.  Lowry wants you to use your imagination at the end.  At first I didn't like this.  I wanted something more real.  In retrospect, however, I've come to see that there is no room for reality and, at the same time, room for much, much more.
B00005JPCF|5.0|My order came in quickly and the movie was fantastic.  If you enjoy being entertained and geared to children of any age, this is the movie for you.  Loved every minute of it!!!  In fact, I saw this in the movies and just had to have it.   <br /> <br />Very entertaining!
B00005JKDR|5.0|We love this movie, whenever my daughter has ponytail on she looks just like Boo.
B000GTJT0C|3.0|Video transfer quality is great. Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 soundtrack is very clean - I haven't listened to the DTS soundtrack, but it includes one. Special features are PLENTY, among which are both a trailer and a teaser trailer in HD.<br /><br />If you enjoy this movie, I would say you get a great value for the money with the quality and all the features. If you've never seen this movie before, and you feel the same way as I do about some of the other movies I've reviewed here on Amazon, then you may feel the same way as I do about \\"Tomb Raider\\" as well.<br /><br />My first impression - having all the bells and whistles of a great surround system - leads me to conclude that it's plenty \\"Tomb\\" but not quite \\"Raider\\".<br /><br />The story is decent as far as \\"adventures\\" go, perhaps more on the unconvincing side, but the action seemed small to me: gunfire petite...explosions dainty...somewhat corny...Lara evades a gunman's barrage of bullets in the main lobby of her mansion like a schoolyard tetherball going around its pole, and I couldn't help but be reminded of writings I remember from the U.S.S. Alabama - \\"Lead Dammit, Lead!\\"<br /><br />\\"Tomb Raider\\" may be more of (but not necessarily) a \\"chick flic\\" adventure (pardon the reference) strongly cashing in on the \\"daddy's little girl\\" theme, which could easily alienate some. However, do not assume me biased about a female lead: I found \\"Aeon Flux\\" to be an outstanding film - it too has a female lead.<br /><br />It turns out I honestly just didn't like this movie. If you're a fan of the \\"Tomb Raider\\" videogame, or of Angelina Jolie, or of archeological adventures or of the aforementioned thematic structure, you might get a kick out of this film. If you're particular about your collection, you may want to be cautious about this one - but in its defense, it's all a matter of taste.<br /><br />I neither recommend nor condemn this film - I just didn't like it.
B00005JM02|5.0|If this was the only movie my daughter had to watch, she'd be a happy girl.  She loves this movie and knows all the characters.  She even watched it twice in one day!
B000AARKOO|5.0|The beginning could have been more clear and some of the parts were unnecessary.  The topic and the morals this movies have may be contridictory in the religious aspects.  But overall, the movie was powerful, the characters well defined, and human virtues and faults are revealed.
B000093FLA|5.0|not a fan of leaving long detailed reviews but this movie is pretty much awesome from beginning to end...Def check it out!
B00005JPP6|4.0|Officer Nicholas Angel is an over-the-top overachiever on the London police force. In appearance, he looks a bit like Daniel Craig's James Bond. And, like Bond, Angel seems to be master of every skill a person could name - the list of achievements becomes ludicrous after a while. Then we see official recognition and reward for his single minded dedication. The department promotes him to sergeant, and ship him out to a sleepy little village halfway to nowhere. He was making the rest look bad.<br /><br />The village of Sandford probably hasn't changed since Elizabethan times, and like it that way. It's peopled by enough eccentrics for a brace of britcoms, but utterly peaceful - at first glance. Oh, there are a few alcohol-related incidents, but the Neighborhood Watch turns apoplectic at the first stroke of grafitti or street performer. Then people start dying in bloody ways under bizarre circumstances. And, for some reason, the population and even the police detectives seem happy with any convoluted logic that can explain the deaths away as accidents. But Angel knows there's more --<br /><br />-- and saying more would say too much. You just have to see the rest for yourself. All the town's weirdness comes to a head, and bursts like a boil of social corruption. It includes the most laugh-out-loud running gun battle I've ever seen. It also satirizes the extremes of small-town pride, which only seems to grow larger as the reasons for pride grow smaller.<br /><br />Viewers with sensitive stomachs might find some of the mayhem a bit gory. That aside, it's skewed look at stereotypes that deserve to be skewered. After a slightly slow start, it had me rolling. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I have been a big Michael Buble fan since he first became popular in 2003 and love everything he does -- And although this album is wonderful, it's not his best.  I think his best was the first Michael Buble album -- But don't get me wrong -- This is a great cd with great tracks -- His rendition of \\"Me & Mrs. Jones\\" and \\"You Were Always on My Mind\\" are  absolutely wonderful.  As far as the new tunes ... well ... I think I'll have to let them grow on me -- They are not as catchy as the last ones on his last cd, (i.e. \\"Home\\", etc.), but this album is well worth buying and listening to as is everything Michael Buble does ...
B000M5AJQS|3.0|While the story itself was intriguing and the actors great (many of my favorites) I was very disturbed by the \\"extremely graphic violent\\" content of this movie; it seems to me though given the nature of the main character and his associates in this story and although true; the producers could have used some level of discretion in the amount of \\"graphic violence\\" when portraying the events that took place--leave something to the viewers imagination so as not to ruin the experience.  Frankly, it was difficult to sit through the entire movie just due to the graphic extent of the violence deplicted.  You don't need to draw adults a graphic picture in such detail to get the point across and still maintain a good production. Otherwise, this movie would have ranked a \\"5\\" for the story itself.  WAKE UP HOLLYWOOD! <br />and WAKE UP AMERICA! <br />[[ASIN:B000M5AJQS The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this show.  I have purchased every season released to date.
630460291X|5.0|Okay... when this movie came out it was panned by the critics.  And aside from a special few of whom I've discussed this movie, it isn't a big favorite of the masses. <br />But I ignore everyone else's opinion because I totally love this movie!  Purchased this DVD to replace my VHS.  I love the story, I love the actors, and I love the Brian Adams song at the end.  I'm a stickler for a good villian, and this movie has one.  Not necessarily the evilest, but unintentionally, character wise, very funny. <br />If you've not seen this movie, perhaps you should rent it first, but sometimes purchasing a used movie is actually cheaper than renting it.  And if you don't like it... sell it on e-bay.
B0000C8AVX|4.0|(Oooops!  I meant 5-stars!)  Bob Dylan, the great alchemist of folk-rock music, was booed at the Newport Folk Festival, and Scorsese's 'No Direction Home' documents the hecklers yelling out \\"Traitor!\\" at many concerts. Perhaps like any genius this is the inscrutable, but predictable development for anyone who truly innovates the wheel. 'Bringing It All Back Home' is the culprit that showcases the trajectory of when Bob, the Bard, went electric. Arguably, this album is one of the three best of his entire career. It is perhaps his most innovative, but his achievements have a scope that render the past two assertions needing a huge dose of salt.     Heralding the album, \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" while not as dramatic as \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is easily as brilliant. Complete with cutting, social commentary and plenty of images to debunk the nine-to-five existence, Dylan spills out his surreal period full throttle. Anthems rain with the raunchy \\"Outlaw Blues\\" and the folky \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\". Hypnotic, every song pulls a punch--or doesn't pull any punches! The most famous mesmerizing development is \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" making Dylan a troubadour for altered consciousness*. Despite the crossover, Dylan continued to be a great storyteller. The first person \\"Maggie's Farm\\" showcases his familiar wit with the details of menial labor from hell. Then, \\"On the Road Again\\" captures the same idea, but with more of a vagabond flair. \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" meets every element at the crossroads by telling a surreal story with pointed observations. However, some of the most delightful moments reflect upon love. \\"She Belongs to Me\\" and \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" both exalt and debunk the romantic tradition he helped overthrow. \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" ends the album with a brilliant story about a misfit who trashes every sensibility of romantic notions.     An unqualified achievement, 'Bringing It All Back Home' synthesizes the outlaw with the dreamer where both folk and rock, tradition and iconoclasm meet head on and make music and culture new.     (*Dylan has moved on, and hopefully so can we.)
B000M341QE|3.0|Bought it because of the \\"big name\\" actors in it and the awards it received...however, too much foul language in it to enjoy the acting.  Just my opinion.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|We had a flawless transaction on this one. Plus, what a great classic. My wife loves Disney movies and this is one of her all time favorites, so it made a great gift.
0843176016|5.0|I've read this book to my son, and it's one of his favorites. I'm slowly working on getting all of the mr. men and little miss books for him. He enjoys all these books.
B00004STPT|3.0|I was disappointed with this soundtrack collection in that it could have been so much better. For a CD that you are going to sell, the producers should have hit the main themes and stuck to the powerful imagery of this magnificent film.
B0001FR3IG|5.0|I love Hallie Berry and being scared, and I thought this movie looked interesting from the coming attractions on TV.  I was pleasantly surprised that it delivered exactly what I love.<br /><br />I would not call this horror, not in the sense of blood and gore, as some people believe is the only criteria for horror.  This was more of a psychological thriller or a paranormal suspense.  You didn't really know what you were going to get.  I went into it thinking it may be traditional horror, what with the scenes of the girl in the road with the long, stringy hair in her face (think The Ring), so when I actually got a plot that was well thought out, I was happy.<br /><br />I thought adding the paranormal aspects kept you guessing a bit.  Don't get me wrong, if you looking for answers, you can figure it out before the ending, but it certainly didn't have plot holes.  From a writer's standpoint, as I am, I was intrigued with the way they developed the storyline.  That's a bit vague, but I can't go into it without disclosing the end, which I won't do.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for senseless blood and gore, don't buy it.  If you want to spend a couple of hours being entertained and enjoy paranormal suspenses then get a copy now.  This will be a movie I watch more than once.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is what a movie soundtrack should be! It is powerful, plays on the main themese and energy of the film, and there is no doubt what your are listening to! This is a must have if you love the \\"Pirates\\" movies or are just a pirate at heart.
B00005NKK8|3.0|I don't own this soundtrack but I've seen the movie a ton of times.  I don't see Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\" on here.  It was playing in the scene where Jenny almost committed suicide by standing on a ledge at some hotel.  And \\"Stoned Love\\" wasn't even in the movie.  Isn't this supposed to be a soundtrack for a movie, not the \\"best hits of...?\\"
B00001QEE5|5.0|This made for a wonderful gift for my wife, who watches and collects and loves Disney movies... especially the classics. The seller was great with the packaging and delivery... a flawless transaction! The movie itself was sealed new and a true joy to watch. Many thanks!
0793518326|4.0|I enjoy the scores very much.  The print is small, and to play some of the music on a keyboard, I need to copy the music and enlarge it.  It's fun to listen to the songs and follow along with the scores.  If you're a Beatles fan, as I am, this is definately something that you will want to have.
B0000026KQ|3.0|Jeff Beck is often compared to his two fellow Yardbird alumni, Messrs Clapton and Page and frequently gets (deserved)credit for having surpassed them in his vision of what a guitar can do. While I'm not familiar enough with Page's work, other than the better known Led Zep material, to speak to his accomplishments, I'd have to say that Clapton, at least as it appears, has deepened in ways not evident on Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop. Sure, there are great grooves and intense playing and of course, amazing guitar solos. But the auto garage metaphor here works more than perhaps the musicians knew. The album is mostly pure, metallic testosterone. Barely any subtlety or warmth. Big, powerful and unapologetically beefy, Guitar Shop is an engaging disc but you're more likely to sit in wide-eyed appreciation of it than be moved or touched by it. It's shiny, but cold. Want to hear Jeff Beck more in touch with his \\"feminine side?\\" Check out his recent duet with Kelly Clarkson that aired on the American Idol charity benefit (available on itunes). He's restrained, sensitive and lyrical. And almost 20 years older!

B0009A40ES|5.0|The release of American Psycho in 2000 was accompanied by many an outraged editorial about the gore-fest nature and loathsome treatment of women in the script.  It created a sensation, and although most editorialists got it completely wrong, I do applaud them for creating a buzz around this outstanding film.  Director Mary Harron transports the viewer to Manhattan in the 1980's, impeccably re-creating the outfits, interior d&eacute;cor, snotty theme restaurants, and modern art of the time.  The main characters consist of Patrick Bateman and his fellow Wal Street merger and acquisition Vice Presidents, all of whom sit in their offices looking important and dreaming up ways to one-up the other with new business card fonts or current event tid-bits.  They date socialites who are either zonked out on drugs or working hard climbing the right social ladders.<br /><br />Patrick is, of course, an American Psycho.  He's a fastidious, narcissistic serial killer.  He doesn't limit himself to just women, but the most fantastic scenes in the movie occur when he kills beautiful model-types.  The movie has a very simple and very powerful message:  Patrick is deranged, but so is everyone around him.  Everyone is as soul-less as Patrick, and when he tries to confess his crimes, the vacuous nature of his world renders his confession unbelievable to all his friends and associates.  There is a Realtor, in fact, who proves herself to be far more deranged than Patrick, and she commits no outright crime.<br /><br />This movie is a brilliant satire of a period piece.  The gore is mainly off-screen and subtle, and the murders are almost campy (Patrick running around condo hallways naked save for sneakers and a bloody chainsaw, anyone?).
0800141660|3.0|I found this a serviceable but not spectacular adaptation of Austen's novel.<br /><br />Performances are good, though the story has been so compressed that you will find yourself forced to pay strict attention.  I'll confess that I hadn't read \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" before seeing it, so I spent most of the movie trying to figure out who was who, and what was going on.  I don't think it's for the casual viewer.<br /><br />Probably my biggest beef with this version is the editing:  I found it painfully hectic.  Cuts were quick, scenes were not permitted to linger, nuances were left undeveloped, and everything was in general lopped off to make way for the next thing.<br /><br />Large sections of the production therefore have almost the feel of an MTV video, with many shots lasting about a second or less, leaving the viewer to wonder what is the wisdom of frogmarching us along so.<br /><br />The answer is simple:  the filmmakers, intending this for wide release, knew they had a convoluted story to tell but had to bring it in in about 2 hours.<br /><br />Since the mood and tempo of Austen's novel is completely at variance with what you see here (although consonant in other ways), I have no choice but to consider Lee's near-frenetic pace as an unfortunate and damaging decision.<br /><br />7 Academy Award nominations, though?  I didn't think it was that great.
0739340131|2.0|The premise is interesting and some of the stories are entertaining but as others have indicated the military interviews are so lacking in credibility that they border on ridiculous. The author clearly did a great deal of research on weapons systems but his knowledge of military culture and thinking is unsophisticated at best and an embarrassing caricature at worst. At these points it devolves into puerile teenage boy gizmo fantasy writing. The audiobook version gets very tedious in these sections and the \\"testimony\\" from various actors is too often contrived and histrionic. <br /> <br />I guess it is just meant as harmless fun but for all the tedious details he often gets it wrong.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Given everything that the Good Shepherd has going for it on paper alone, saying the overall result is disappointing is saying it a bit lightly.  Robert De Niro's \\"pet project\\" and first directorial effort since A Bronx Tale, the Good Shepherd follows the life of the brilliant Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) and the beginnings and origins of the CIA.  Throughout the film, we witness the career triumps of Wilson as well as his personal failures that haunt him throughout the years.  The multi-layered, fact based script justifies the nearly three hour running time, but the overall effect of the Good Shepherd just doesn't perform nearly as well as it should.  Damon is wooden to say the least, while Angelina Jolie's talent is wasted as Wilson's long suffering wife.  There are notable supporting actors as well, including De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, John Turturro, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Billy Crudup, Michael Gambon, 2001's Keir Dullea, and the great Joe Pesci (making his first screen appearance in almost a decade), but none of them are around long enough to make much impact.  Not to mention that the deliberately slow pacing of the film can really be difficult to sit through, and while the Good Shepherd isn't a bad film one bit, it is a disappointment nonetheless.  All in all, fans of fact based spy films or De Niro should definitely give the Good Shepherd a look, but be well forewarned before entering.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|O.K., maybe it's not Classic Rush, but it's a Very Good, well produced CD. Kudos to Nick K for helping Rush update their Sound. Like all Prog Rock it takes a few listens to get, However Rush is more into Making Solid songs these days then showing off. I'd rate this in the top 1/3 of all Rush albums. I like the Artwork on the inside better then the front cover.
0743496728|5.0|Jodi Picoult is by far my favorite author and Nineteen Minutes is easily one of my new favorite books.  Like all of her books, this one is hard to put down.  Right from the start I was trying to figure out the \\"twist\\" but was ultimately unsuccessful.   <br />All of Jodi's books have a realness to them; meaning what happens in her books could very easily happen in real life.  I think that's important to remember while reading Nineteen Minutes.  Not only is in an excellent read, but it reminds parents to be involved and aware of what's going on in their child's life.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I just bought this album, and also saw PT in concert here in Seattle. Overall I feel that the songs work better on disc than in concert. A lot of this is to do with the dynamic range, the kind of vocal styles, and the complexity of some of the tracks (especially Anesthetic).
B000JJSRNY|5.0|What can I say .....as a Kiwi this is the only way I can see a concert like this and it is well worth owning this DVD.Placido still has the magic of one of the worlds greatest tenors and Rolando is a fitting partner in the realm of tenors.But as always it is the petit framed Anna Netrebko that lifts the hearts of the listeners .from her breath taking first notes to the last she imparts a zest for music that has long been missed in opera houses for many years .What truely was magic was her voice without mic in the final part of La Boheme that showed why she is the best there is ,her pure voice carried clear to the final rows of eager concert goers and they showed their appreciation to someone who is often chided for her less than staid approach to opera ,I know of one of the greatest Divas of all time who will be cheering this young woman on and that is Dame Joan Sutherland who always uplifts other singers as she knows how hard it is to be one.All I can say is long may she reign as the new diva of the 22nd century and may her voice continue to grow in stature for many years to come.

B000FVBLEI|5.0|Of course you can't really write a review without mentioning SF, (given the history of the two bands) but give me a break, I simple can't stand Brian AT ALL. Dude sounds cheap and forgettable, as do his backing vocalists that couldn't write a catchy riff if their life depended on it. SF are nothing, I stepped in a pile of Dog crap and thought of them the other day. <br /> <br />ALL THAT REMAINS on the other hand are far from the pile I mentioned. I find that at anygiven time of the day, I have riffs running through my head from this new release. Not to mention that production wise this is the heaviest by far, not really too much different from the last release but it is HEAVIER-(somehow.) <br /> <br />As a guitarist, (which is a huge part of my beef with SF - cause again they SUCK) I find All That Remains to be on the top of their game. And the material is just honest. The stories are real and true to life, but then again SF could be, but I fall asleep before they ever get to their point.  <br /> <br />There isn't one song on this disc that I don't love, but 1 - 2 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 9 & 11 are my favs, the rest are just my second favs. <br /> <br />SF is a history lesson Phil and ATR are present and FUTURE.
B000002G0P|5.0|In 1992, if an interviewer had asked who their most influential band had been, chances are that Pat Badger, Nuno Bettencourt, Gary Cherone, and Paul Geary of Extreme would answer with the 70s hard-rock band, Queen. With a flair for the dramatic, and the fluidity of vocals to back it, Cherone ably reproduced the presence that was Freddie Mercury - yet maintained a uniqueness all his own. Mixing one part Brian May and one part Eddie Van Halen, the blazing guitar riffs by Bettencourt set him apart from the pack of late 80s hair-metal, due mainly to his ability to aptly devise melody and funk rhythms throughout his work. Rounding out the quartet, Badger on bass guitar provided a strong undercurrent of sound and Geary was rock-solid in his timing and fill on drums. Based out of Boston, Massachusetts, the band had had some commercial success from their previous albums with \\"Play with Me\\" from Extreme I appearing in the movie soundtrack for \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,\\" and \\"More than Words,\\" from Extreme II: Pornograffitti, being broadcast incessantly over the radio waves. When they released their third album, \\"III Sides to Every Story,\\" Extreme showed their roots with a concept album. Like Queen in previous years, they decided to create an opus, or story, broken into three sections labeled: \\"Yours,\\" \\"Mine,\\" and \\"The Truth.\\" It was diverse, original, and stunning, and although not as successful as their second album, was masterfully crafted and has been heralded as their finest work to date. <br /> <br />All of the songs on this album aren't just good, they're damn good, but two that will push their way forward are \\"Peacemaker Die\\" and \\"God Isn't Dead?\\" With the former, strong rhythms and musical hooks are coupled with vocal harmonies distinctive to Extreme's overall sound, and are again reminiscent of Queen. Powerful lyrics with a dash of sound bite from none other than the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech captivate the listener and evoke emotions of loss for such a great man. Although not a fan of musical overdubs, the orchestration of this song is layered and thick with such a good sound, it hardly goes noticed. As in previous albums, they blend smooth vocal patterns with lightning-fast guitar riffs, thumping bass, and crisp rhythms, but this time to produce a chilling view of how the world's leaders do not allow a dissonant voice of reason that is calling for peace to live. In sharp contrast to this, \\"God Isn't Dead?\\" starts softly, with just piano and vocals beseeching listeners to help Cherone through his drought of faith and bemoaning his fate in the world. Building throughout the song in an undertone, a full 70-piece orchestra supports the duo, which breaks from their previous album work of just keyboard and synthesizer. This shows a commitment to a full-fledged opus and not just another album. As the flutes, strings, and horns begin their slow, steady crescendo, the corresponding vocals follow to a harsh and hooking abrupt halt. Here, Cherone's passionate fortissimo, \\"Please tell me God Isn't Dead!\\" ends the song with the denouement of \\"I want to know...\\"where he is accompanied only by piano again. Haunting and beautiful, the song will stick with a person for years on end. <br /> <br />Overall, Extreme's third release shows their extreme (pun intended) versatility and daring, with a mix of hard rock, symphonic orchestrations, and melodic ballads to tempt the soul. Unbelievable vocal harmonies make this a delight to listen to, and the lyrical content is unsurpassed, as the listener will find himself or herself actually paying attention for a much-needed change. This is their best work without a doubt, followed closely by the funk-laced and rock-driven \\"Pornograffitti\\" following a close second; and an album highly suggested. It contains many of the band's \\"trademark\\" sounds and will most likely not disappoint. But, it is recommended to at pick III Sides up first, for a masterpiece work of music that will keep the listener enthralled for years. <br />
B0000942HV|4.0|When I had bought this I had ordered the original version and received this version. When I saw that it was 2003 I thought about returning it, but decided to keep it. When I first put it on I immediately noticed a difference even though I had not heard this in years. I still have the vinyl LP from the '70s! I really like this version of Tubular Bells, but I am not sure if I like it as much as the original version. The original version was done with less instruments which lends to its uniqueness. The sound quality of this version is by far better than the original due to the limitations from the source tape of the original. All in all, I am glad I kept this version, but will buy the original version also.
0679746048|5.0|I have people I care about who are mentally ill.  This book was an almost beautiful way to show me how they may have viewed the world.  None of it was easy.  Most of it was downright horrifying.  But the insights into it were agonizingly clear.  Ms. Kaysen alternates the 1st person viewpoint of living in an asylum for two years with the clinical paperwork that accompanied it.  The result is disturbing.  But . . . the last few chapters, dealing with her life since that experience, hands out a vision of, not hope necessarily, but a sense of horizon, for those of us who have loved ones struggling with mental illness. <br />One cautionary note though.  This is not a book for children.  There are  levels of sexuality and violence not appriopriate for the young.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|I have every Rush album, and with the exception of \\"Caress of Steel,\\" I never thought that RUSH had made a \\"Bad\\" record. (Some mediocre ones?... sure, bad?... no).  Until \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" that is.   <br /> <br />All the things I love about RUSH are nowhere to be found on this CD.  No up-tempo anthems, no lyrical imagery, no inspiring musicianship, no grooves, and the sin of all sins - no melody.  Geddy seems to not even bother with vocal melody on this CD, to the point of where calling him a singer is a wild stretch.  Other than some elements on \\"Far Cry,\\" I cannot remember a single hook, phrase, riff, harmony, bass line, drum fill or passage on S&A, mainly because there aren't any to be found.    Here's where the cries come bellowing in from every \\"real\\" RUSH fan who loves this CD, accusing us \\"non-believers\\" of living in the past and wanting RUSH to just make another \\"Permanent Waves\\" or \\"Roll the Bones.\\"  And I admit that there are fans out there who think that way.  But that's not me and that's not why this CD fails:  It fails because of incomplete songwriting and the producer falling asleep at the wheel. <br /> <br />It is what it is... lethargic and meandering, with tempos that never get above a medium-slow pace.  If you like your power-trio rock music slow, slower and more slow, then this is for you.  And I do appreciate slow songs, but almost every single one, one after another?? You've got to be kidding me!  These songs make SOUNDGARDEN sound like MOTORHEAD!  Was there an ether leak in the studio when they recorded? <br /> <br />As I listened I kept thinking to myself, \\"Okay, any minute this thing's gonna turn the corner and TAKE OFF!\\"  Nope, never happened - it just drones on and on and on... one riff-less, punch-less, melody-less, pedestrian song after the next.  Listening to S&A is like watching a senile old man wandering around looking for his car keys, except with the old man, he eventually finds them - this CD never does. <br /> <br />For me, what this boils down to is that S&A sounds like a demo of new ideas that the band and producer never developed, combed over, scrutinized and refined.  It's as though they all thought the first round of ideas were good \\"as is\\" and left it at that, leaving the material on this album sounding neglected and unfinished.  Here's where I blame the producer - his job is to make sure none of this happens and that the band doesn't get too narrowly focused and keeps the big picture in mind.  That all sounds lost here. <br /> <br />Rush is still a great band, and I have nothing but respect for them.  But this CD is very disapointing and has nothing to offer in the way of exciting, powerful music that sticks to my brain and makes me wanna come back for more.  You can't win them all I guess, and after over 30 years of great music from Geddy, Neil & Alex, I guess it was only a matter of time before they had a train wreck.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

Kudos to the execs for releasing this baby!

B000L43AN4|5.0|I bought this CD a couple of weeks ago, but haven't heard it.  My husband immediately took it from me & hasn't given it back. \\"Oh, I keep forgetting it at work.\\" He said it's great.  Based on that & the other reviews, I'm giving it a 5 star rating anyway. :) <br /> <br />I plan on getting it by this weekend or going out to buy my own copy.
B00003CWPL|4.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I finally saw this legendary cult favorite, Lynch's first feature shot in black and white with the most unusual sound effects and arresting visuals for the first time and I had rather unusual reaction to the film. Its genre is presented as combination of Fantasy / Drama / Horror and the keywords that have been used the most are disturbing, depressing, and bizarre. I found the movie hysterically funny and I laughed for the first 80 minutes of it (I saw the 88 minutes long version). The ending is surely disturbing and unpleasant but the movie has so many comical scenes and images that I wonder if someone else has got the same impression? How about Henry Spencer's (Jack Nance) electrified-looking hair that seems to point to Heaven, where \\"everything is fine. You've got your good things. And I've got mine\\" as sung by Lady in the Radiator (tell me she was not hilarious)? The dinner at X family with the carving of chicken scene in particular is a comical masterwork. How about a mutant baby? I think there is (or should be) a rule - the scariest monster is the one that we never see, the uncertainty is the scariest monster of all and as long as we don't see it we picture it in our imagination and get scared of what we imagine. Once the monster is for us to see, it is not scary anymore, it is laughable...<br /><br />After the movie was over and left me puzzled and uncertain to what I just saw, I decided to watch the interview with Lynch to see what the father of \\"Eraserhead\\" has to say about his movie, its idea, his interpretation. I've got to tell you that he did an awesome job in not telling anything about his own vision of what he created. The interview was longer than the movie and Lynch recalled the smallest details about the days (and months and years) of working on his first film while he was a student at the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies when he was shooting mostly at night and used the most unusual buildings for his story or rather for collection of nightmarish images accompanied with the soundtrack that sounds like it was recorded in a machine shop. Yes, Lynch talked about many things but when it came to the question on what the movie is about he only said that for 25 years since the movie was released, he had never heard or read a single comment from the critics, viewers or reviewers that would come close to what his vision or concept was. Not a single one. The major impression I had that the movie was a meditation on the male-female relationship that culminates in parenting, and how far from ideal it could get. His first marriage ended while he was directing \\"Eraserhead\\" and there was a child from the marriage. My guess is that maybe Lynch did intend to bring his own bitterness, resentment, and disappointments to his first movie and during all those years he had been working on it, he turned it into the dark comedy.d used the most unusual buildings for his story or rather for collection of nightmarish images accompanied with the soundtrack that sounds like it was recorded in a machine shop.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|I can't stop listening to this cd.  I love it!  It seems to me that Alex really leads the way more than on any other Rush cd.  Not a bad song on it.  I will say however, that I am not a typical Rush fan... I have all of the cd's, and I like them all, but I tend to be different than most Rush fans (examples:  Moving Pictures isn't their best, Caress of Steel is excellent especially Fountain of Lamneth, Tom Sawyer is the worst song on Moving Pictures, I love Signals and Presto, 2112 is very very over rated, Cygnus books 1 & 2 blow 2112 away, Territories may be my favorite song, and Far Cry is the worst song on this cd!). <br />All I can say is that if you have liked a lot of Rush, then give it a few listens.  I probably owned Presto for 10 years before I liked it!  This is an early review, I've only had it for a week or so.... I may dislike it after a few months... but for now, I love it.  Way better than anything recent. <br />I hope there is more to come!  Thanks Geddy, Neil, and Alex! <br />
B00006L7XQ|2.0|A friend gave me this CD, raving about it. I really can't understand the hype attached to this album. The songs that aren't 'standards' are pretty good, though far from Cash's best, but the old chestnuts are almost unlistenable, for me at least. I'd have thought a dying man might find something new to squeeze out of Bridge Over Troubled Water, In My Life, Danny Boy,  Desperado,  I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry  and Streets of Laredo, something that would make these songs worth listening to for the nine-millionth time. Unfortunately he just sounds like an old man singing old chestnuts, they sound just as cliched as when any other artist performs these much-overplayed songwriting cliches.    I do like the production very much so am giving one star for Rick Rubin and one for JC out of respect.
B00005JPAO|4.0|I adored the acting: both Helen Mirren (Queen Elizabeth) and Michael Sheen (Tony Blair) are amazing to watch. I almost forgot what the real Queen and the real Tony Blair looked like! I know it's rather easy to impersonate the Queen with all the right details but Helen Mirren even got the slightly ducky walk down (Not to sound shallow but, of course, the thick ankle props helped. They WERE props, were they not???)  <br /> <br />On a less enthusiastic note: the Queen Mom character was a bit of a caricature but the general idea was solid enough so it did not bother me too much.
0374105235|5.0|A simple book that tells the story of a complicated life. A humbling read and puts your life in perspective. A real life fairytale - from a boy soldier in a 3rd world war torn nation to a UN speaker of child refugees. An amazing change in fate brought about by the writer's own determination to survive, but also the love of many volunteers to the cause.<br /><br />Beautifully written.

006097625X|5.0|I purchased this item, along with McCloud's other book Making Comics, to teach a course on comics in English to art students at Cheongju University in South Korea. Both of these books really lend themselves to teaching, each one is divided into chapters which discuss specific comic concepts and elements. Two excellent chapters: <br /> <br />The first chapter in Understanding Comics is great because it discusses the history of comics, and some great activities can be done having students think about and search for comics in the real world and instances of comics in history. This chapter really validates the fact that comics are interesting and useful, rather than just being treated as a 'fake' art or a 'not really real' subject. <br /> <br />Chapter three is excellent because it breaks down transitions not only in American comics, but European and Asian comics as well, and explains his thoughts as to why these differences exist. This allows students to compare the differences and broaden their understanding of how different cultures think differently. This chapter also discusses how comics are subtractive, and lends itself to an excellent lesson whereupon students can draw comics with many pictures, then keep subtracting and combining pictures until they have the miminum number of pictures that tells the gist of their story.  <br /> <br />In other chapters: Chapter two discusses word choice and flow in comics, four discusses time, chapter five discusses displaying emotion by using different types of lines (and similarities and differences between comics from different cultures), chapter six discusses how words and ideas complement each other in comics, and chapter seven discusses six steps to making comics. <br /> <br />In my opinion, each book is worth its weight in gold alone for a comic class, but they have a synergistic effect when used in tandem with each other. Concepts from one book flow into the other book, and vice-versa, giving the students in-depth knowledge of both how to make comics and how to understand comics from other authors better. All of the concepts from the chapters can be seen easily in comics online or from newspapers, and so each week I first do the lecture, then use a few examples on the overhead that I have found from other comics, then give the students homework pertaining to the concepts discussed.  <br /> <br />Through use of the two books, the students' work is really improving, and it is fun to see them working specifically with each comic element. Each of the concepts discussed in the chapters is a great starting point to get the students' creative juices flowing. I would recommend this book to any teacher or lecturer interested teaching comics at almost any level and to any audience.  <br /> <br />

0743455967|5.0|No wonder, Stephen King sells more novels than anybody else on the plant. His first horror novel, Carrie, was considered by him to be wasteful. It wasn't until his wonderful wife, Tabitha, (God Bless Her!) who retrieved it from the trash to be published. Stephen writes like he is talking to the reader, mostly us aspiring writers, who are busy working as English teachers. Writing should come as easy to us but it doesn't. It takes years of practice. He states that you should write what you mean. None of us can be Shakespeare, Moliere, Stephen King, or any other great novelist. It takes time to work on developing a technique, a style, a perception. That's why young people can't write the same material as somebody more mature or older because they haven't experienced it yet. King's own fiction is based on life often in Maine, New England, or even Colorado for the Shining. He takes us into the realm of the unknown with a bizarre curious fascination for the darkness of life. Maybe that's why he's famous, beloved, and well-read, because he's no nonsense. He hasn't gone Hollywood or New York. He's still the poor boy from small town Maine. He knows about the struggles of life, being poor, struggling to make it, because that what's make him a good writer is that he can identify with the masses of his audiences. His appeal is not to Dr. Harold Bloom who is a literary critical genius. His appeal is broad, told it like it is attitude. No, he might not win the Nobel Prize for Literature. I wouldn't bet on it but he's certainly a large following and I'm sure literary critics will be mulling and arguing over his works for years to come. So he writes to aspiring writers, not to give up but write like it is and be yourself no matter how weird or strange you think you are.
1591841666|5.0|Do you remember starting something new that interested you?  Chances are the world seemed a little brighter, a little more inviting, and your smile was a little wider that day.<br /><br />Now, remember how that same activity seemed after six months had passed.  It's likely you weren't having as much fun; progress was hard to accomplish; and frustration was starting to build.  That's what a dip feels like.<br /><br />That sequence is the normal experience and psychology of creating worthwhile results.<br /><br />But in some cases, you are headed for a dead end where results will never amount to much (if you ever see me play golf, you'll know what I'm talking about).  In rarer cases, results just keep going downhill forever (if you've seen me run lately, you'll get the idea).<br /><br />Many people make mistakes when \\"the going gets tough.\\"<br /><br />1.  Some will keep going even though future results won't reward the effort (such as those who keep trying to master something for which they have little ability).  This behavior is usually the result of bad habits (like always following tradition . . . or existing beliefs) I call \\"stalls\\" that harm progress.<br /><br />2.  Others will quit before they break through into improvements that make an enormous difference (going through a dip) and miss the chance to get great benefits from continuing, well-focused effort.  The \\"best in the world\\" (or \\"best in your corner of the world\\") will get a disproportionate share of the benefits from what everyone does.  Who is going to pay much attention to the 1,000,001 ranked book reviewer on Amazon?  People who behave this way are usually suffering from the procrastination, bureaucracy, ugly duckling or disbelief stalls (see The 2,000 Percent Solution).<br /><br />In past books by Mr. Godin, I've criticized him for taking an article and stretching it too far into a book.  I've also mentioned that he sometimes forgets to explain what to do.<br /><br />In The Dip, Mr. Godin has broken through his dip and avoided both of those problems.  This book is only slightly longer than it needed to be.  It has excellent advice on how to tell the difference between future potential and lack of opportunity.  The point about disproportionate rewards is also well developed.<br /><br />Nice going, Mr. Godin!Dip, Mr. Godin has broken through his dip and avoided both of those problems.

0385333846|5.0|I originally read Slaughterhouse-Five back in high school, it was classified as science fiction. I hated it then because I didn't get it. <br /> <br />After time discovering that history is not about memorizing dates but what happened and learning about the firebombing of Dresden, Germany, I returned to Slaughterhouse-Five for a new look. Billy Pilgrim is an absurd protagonist. He isn't manly or a knight in shining armor, he's an infantry man taken prisoner and a witness to a massacre that out did the atomic bombs. <br /> <br />Forget that Billy comes unstuck in time and his alien abduction, what matters is that Kurt Vonnegut makes an event that is so overwhelming human and knowable - not understandable. <br /> <br />Put aside any expectations about how a book should read and slip into this novel that makes history come alive on the level of one man's point of view. <br /> <br />And so it goes. <br />
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Before I listened to this cd, I did a little reflection.  For some reason, I flashed back to the day I got Grace Under Pressure, 20 plus some odd years ago.  I remember being in High School and looking forward to every new Rush album.  I remember thinking back then, how long will these guys be around?  Will I be in my fortys and still listening to them?  I wondered. <br /> <br />Well, here we are!  I have been a Rush fan since day one.  I've always found every new album to be one to study, meaning, I had to listen a few times before they would grow on me.  I did that with Vapor Trails, but for the first time in my experience, I found fault.  It didn't grip me after multiple listens and I gave up.  I worried that maybe the day had come for one of my favorite bands. <br /> <br />My brother, whom I turned on to Rush, bought me the Rush 30 DVD.  I really enjoyed it, since I hadn't seen them play live for over a decade.  I was invigorated! <br /> <br />Just by chance I found out that a new Rush was coming out.  It was a must buy!  First listen was in my car, I wasn't sure my feelings as I listened.  I have now listened to Snakes and Arrows on my home stereo and can say this:  I really like this album!  Snakes and Arrows is exactly what I would have expected to hear from Rush 20 years after Grace Under Pressure.  This album to me is the most mature album to date.  Rush, like all of us, have grown with time.  Very nice work Guys! <br /> <br />A Rush fan til the end!
B00005JLCI|5.0|I was introduced to this version of my favourite Shakespeare play in senior year of high school english class (2004) on double-VHS and have been waiting for a decent release on DVD ever since! This is by far the best version i have seen of Hamlet with superb acting, great sets and most of all - the complete play! This is probably one of the few DVDs i would be willing to pay full price for when it first comes out. Ironically, i was just telling someone a 3 days ago that i can't wait for this to come out on DVD because it's been so long waiting for no good reason. A must see!
0375703764|1.0|Those who can't write write 'post-modern' novels, which is not to say that post-modern novels are uniformly bad, only that post-modern literary devices (pseudo-scholarly footnotes, fragmented storylines, clever font manipulations, lengthy quotes in foreign languages, to name a few), are all too often, these days, the refuge of writers who lack talent enough to write more conventional novels.  HoL is a staggeringly dull novel (did it really give Gregory Maguire [see book jacket] nightmares?  Did he really have to stop reading it before bedtime?  He must scare pretty easily).  Rather, I should say, it is conventionally dull (for the lameness of the story, and the very poor quality of the writing), and \\"staggering\\" for its sheer volume.  It must have taken Danielewski months on end just to type the manuscript, let alone proof-read, edit, draft and re-draft chapters, etc.  It beggars the imagination. <br /> <br />HoL is not merely lame.  It is also staggeringly (once again, I am staggered, truly) pretentious, replete as it is with pseudo-scholarly references, long passages of pseudo-film- and literary-criticism, endless pseudo-(fill in other field) notes, etc.  Bret Easton Ellis [see book jacket, again] moronically opines, \\"One can imagine Thomas Pynchon, J. G. Ballard, Stephen King, and David Foster Wallace bowing at Danielewski's feet, choking with astonishment, surprise, laughter, and awe.\\"  Ellis must have been choking on something himself when he wrote this.  I've never read Ballard and read very little King.  I have read Wallace and Pynchon, however.  By any measure, HoL is only the crudest evocation of these authors' works.  Whatever one thinks of Infinite Jest or Gravity's Rainbow, as novels, at the very least they attest the wide-ranging intellects of the authors who conceived them.  HoL, by contrast, is all flash, tiresome tiresome flash, and no substance. <br /> <br />It is vastly overrated -- hardly the \\"demonically brilliant book...impossible to ignore, putdown, or persuasively conclude reading\\" that Jonathan Lethem [book jacket, again] says it is. <br /> <br />House of Leaves = Waste of Time

It does a great job on my linoleum floors and the floors are cleaner than when I used a broom. It by no means could replace a vacuum, but it does get up quite a bit on carpet. I use it regularly and have yet to have problems. I particularly like how I can clean small rugs that my vacuum could not do without sucking them up. I gave it four stars on account of hearing that the battery only lasts 6 months....but that really is the only problem.
0743289684|5.0|This account of Ayaan Hirsi Ali's life growing up muslim and then discovering western ideals I found to be extremely interestig.

B00005JLCI|5.0|I have been waiting for many years for Ken Branagh's Hamlet to make it onto DVD.I have watched it so many times on video, I have lost count. It's shameful how many pitiful movies that show up in the bargain bin have been converted onto DVD when my favorite actor's fabulous version of Hamlet, uncut the whole 4 hours was stuck on VHS.  I have seen many Hamlet's from Olivier, Christopher Plummer, Richard Chamberlain, Derek Jacobi and it seems to me that the Magnificent Dane made it to the big time in Branagh's Hamlet.  I have read many of the reviews posted here.  I admit I am biased, since I love anything Ken Branagh has put on film. I enjoyed the cameo roles given by Jack Lemon, Robin Williams and a host of others, and Julie Christie's Gertrude was enjoyable. Derek Jacobi's Claudius was excellent.  <br /> <br /> In the mid 1960's I did an independent study for English Honors in high school so you might say I have had a life long love affair with the Prince of Denmark. Ken Branagh's performance has been criticized. but in my opinion he was an excellent Hamlet, with perhaps a different viewpoint than other versions, every actor who undertakes Hamlet brings a different interpretation to the role.  We are all in for a treat with this 4 hour DVD presentation.

B000002O4S|5.0|My older brother had this tape back when it came out. We really loved all the movies as well as the songs in them. I have heard the Huey Lewis songs and the theme songs a million times, but I forgot all about the \\"buried treasure\\". I remember hearing \\"time bomb town\\" very briefly in the scene where marty's alarm goes off. I always thought it sounded like a weird song and never payed attention to it. Fast forward to 2007. I came across this soundtrack and \\"Time Bomb Town\\" blew me away. You may know Lindsey Buckingham as the guy in Fleetwood Mac, but he has some great solo stuff including \\"Holiday Road\\" from \\"National Lampoon's Vacation\\" Soundtrack from 1980 (another classic!)  Anyway, I have been listning to \\"Time Bomb Town\\" non-stop for the last week, it is my favorite song at the moment and one of his best(including Fleetwood-Mac). It sounds very fresh, for being over 20 years old, and in my opinion is the best song on this soundtrack. CHECK IT OUT!

B000005KQT|4.0|Wonderful harmonica music!  The liner notes mention that Marion \\"Little Walter\\" Jacobs was experimenting with different methods of getting the most out of his harmonica playing.  He finally discovered an answer through the \\"use of a hand-held microphone which was plugged into its own amplifier. . .  By `going electric,' Walter single-handedly transformed the harmonica. . . .\\"<br /><br />Some nice cuts on this CD.  One was a tune that he played when he was with Muddy Waters' band in Chicago in the very early 1950s, \\"Juke.\\"  This is an instrumental tune and well played, beginning with some very strong harmonica work by Little Walter.  The band overall produces a nice blues sound.  Fun to listen to!<br /><br />By the time \\"Blues with a Felling\\" was recorded, Little Walter had left Waters' band and had a new one of his own, featuring the Myers Brothers and Fred Below.  Once more, the harmonica work is great.  Little Walter sings nicely, although his voice is not in the genre of Sonny Boy Williamson (II), Muddy Waters, or Howlin' Wolf.  One nice line:<br /><br />\\"I'm gonna find my baby<br />If it takes all night and day\\"<br /><br />\\"My Babe\\" is a nice little rocking song.  As before, good harmonica and good overall band playing.  The recurring vocal riff: \\"My babe don't stand no cheating.\\"<br /><br />Another quick note.  \\"Confessin' the Blues\\" was covered by the Rolling Stones.<br /><br />In short, a nice album.  His singing may not have been as rough and distinctive and powerful as other leading blues singers of the era, but he still sang well enough.  And the harmonica work was outstanding.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|The Straight Story is a film about an old man named Alvin Straight who hasn't talked to his brother Lyle in ten years because they said some \\"unforgiving things to one another.\\" He finds out that his estranged brother is dying and he decides to make amends and say good-bye. He drives hundreds of miles with a giant trailer attached to a lawn mower. The story is based on facts.<br /><br />David Lynch is known for his cutting edge, bizarre and perplexing mysteries but when taken into account with all his other films The Straight Story (and it's unusual G-rating) should be no surprise. Lynch went from the completely off-the-wall horror Eraserhead to in my opinion one of the most touching films ever made in The Elephant Man. He is no stranger to drama and it manifests itself in varying depths in every one of his films.  It often shows up in the most surprising of places. Lynch is acclaimed and credited more after Mulholland Dr., however, in many years from now he will get many of the same accolades that guys like Stanley Kubrick do now for films like this one. Lynch is a master of his craft and among the best American Directors of our time. It sounds like a bold statement now but the years will tell. I for one will argue his films are timeless.<br /><br />The Straight Story unfolds at a snail's pace and plays the most straight forward formulas to the tee...I'm not saying that as a drawback but it may not be for everyone.  It is the perfect environment for Lynch to show he can direct a great drama with a narrative and some older actors like Richard Farnsworth (excellent as the likeable Alvin Straight) and briefly Harry Dean Stanton as Lyle. Sissy Spaceck is also excellent as Alvin's daughter. If I were to list the most touching sequences in film for me, two come from Lynch films. One scene being when John Merrick is well received by Dr. Treves' wife in the Elephant Man, and the other being a scene from The Straight Story. The scene starts off as a sort of comical and lighthearted part in the movie where twins work on Alvin's broken down lawnmower and they fight while they are doing it. It almost seems like Lynch is being exploitative at first here, but he makes you relate tremendously and feel for these two brothers (especially if you're a twin or have a brother close in age like me). It's so simple but Lynch really has created as likeable a character as you can get in Farnsworth's Straight. Another touching scene is when Alvin is asked by a few bikers what the worst thing is about growing old and he replies \\"remembering when I was young\\" with a proud smile.  Farnsworth's recent death makes this statement even harder. The comment is layered but comes off as simple like the rest of this amazing film.<br /><br />Mary Sweeny and John Roach deserve just as much if not more credit for writing this screenplay. I hate giving too much credit to the director but Lynch deserves to be lauded for simply taking on such a pure and uninviting project.  The films his real fans appreciate are for the most part on the other side of the spectrum. It seems risky if it were not for the fact that Lynch is pretty much famous for not giving a damn about risks. However, Lynch is the kind of filmmaker who is capable of creating the most profound kind of drama, but mostly his films are viewed as guilty of shock and not seen far beyond that. When Kubrick began creating his films I'm quite sure many people did the same thing. Lynch is a filmmaking wizard and one of these days the whole world will recognize it.d lighthearted part in the movie where twins work on Alvin's broken down lawnmower and they fight while they are doing it.

B0000029GA|5.0|Nas' debut album, \\"Illmatic\\", will basically dethrone your favorite hip-hop album and wish it never existed. Nas is a one of a kind rapper that actually focuses on the true style of hip hop. The beats are excellent and memorable, especially the addicting piano bits in \\"The World Is Yours\\" and \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\". The trait I admire the most on this album, though, is Nas's lyrical content. It focuses on the hardships of life and how people can easily relate to his style. I don't have much more to say, as the majority of the reviewers basically took the words out of my mouth, but this is an album with zero filler material and only solid, well performed rap songs. Highly recommended.

The version with Sigourney Weaver on Discovery channel is far superior so I will wait for that version to be released but I can't complain either way.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|David Lynch's vision and take on Dune may not compare to the book from which it is taken, but as a stand alone movie, both in its theatrical, as well as in its lengthened (directed by Alan Smithee...) version, are a product that can be considered valid.<br /><br />The story is there, in its essence, the characters are there, although not really all as in the Novel, but then there is really no need for all of them, since it would just complicate an already intricate storyline.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that this movie, even after all these many years, can still stand a comparison with newer Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies.<br /><br />The style, the actors, the music and the scenery alone, lend it an aura of mythical proportions and this makes it far more than just another \\"cult\\" movie, but rather the vision of a true artist, confronted with a vision of another artist and mixing his own to the latter, and in this, David Lynch truly excels.<br /><br />The cast includes a very young Kyle MacLachlan, masters of the trade, such as Max von Sydow, Juergen Prochnow, Patrick Stewart, Sian Phillips, Jose Ferrer, Freddie Jones and many others, whose talents are undisputed to give life to so bigger-than-life characters.<br /><br />For the first time ever, we get both \\"takes\\" on the movie on a single, double-sided disc. One, as mentioned before, the Theatrical version, and the second, the lengthened TV version of the same, in 2.35:1 ratio and in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Stereo.<br /><br />For the price this is a well worthy buy, unless you already own an HD-DVD Player, in which case you may also opt to have that copy, but be warned, that copy only includes the theatrical version.
B000HEWEDK|4.0|Any sci-fi buff well knows the exalted place \\"Forbidden Planet\\" holds in the history of film.  Ground-breaking effects work.  Costumes.  Matte paintings.  The legendary scenes of the Krel (sp?) power generating machines.  The Krel brain booster, apparently set up for a being with multiple appendages.  The one appearance of the lion-like \\"Monster From the Id\\" in the electrical fence while being bombarded by neutron-beam weapons.<br /><br />The one question that anyone who has seen this masterpiece has over the 50 years since the film's release is:  What did the Krel really look like?  The film provides only inferences:  The aforementioned brain booster.  The triangular doors.  The mystery of the appearance of the Krel is a primary aspect that separates this film from all others in the 1950s-and the modern age for that matter.  How many SF films can you name where a character as significant as the Krel makes no visual appearance whatsoever?  The only one I can think of in a similar vein is Universal's \\"The Invisible Man\\", but Claude Rains is visible at points in the film.<br /><br />\\"Forbidden Planet\\" is really about the mysterious Krel, who were so advanced technologically they were able to gain control over the very essence of their material bodies.  The mystery of why they left no record of their physical appearance only makes the irony of their destruction by the evil of \\"The Mindless Primitive\\" within even more interesting.<br /><br />The advent of CGI seems to have all but erased this type of mystery from today's films-to moviegoers detriment.
B0000CFW87|5.0|THIS CD IS FANTASTIC. THE VOCALS ARE SO STRONG IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THEY ARE IN ENGLISH, FRENCH, SPANISH, AND ITALIAN. THE PASSION COMES THRU LOUD AND CLEAR. I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAITED SO LONG TO GET THIS. IT'S PLAYED NEARLY EVERY DAY. EVEN MY 4 AND 7 Y/O SING TO IT.

1582701709|5.0|This book's central theme is positive thought. The author has cleverly tied that theme to every aspect of human life. Critics and skeptics have said that this book is repetitive and contains nothing new. Some have even suggested that it is a waste of money. I believe that the positive thought and positive action that this books speaks so clearly of is the genesis of all success and positive result in the universe. Read it and read it again. Understand it and understand it more deeply. You will begin to feel better about yourself and the weight of your conventional 'stress' will begin to evaporate. Your life can only improve when you give it permission to improve. 'That' is the secret! Unhappy, skeptical, nay sayers will continue to be unhappy until they understand the \\"Secret\\". It is not tangible; it is not visible; it is not something you can feel or touch. The Secret is within us all. It is the essence of our humanity and it belongs to all of us. The Secret is not something that can be disbelieved. It is the opposite of negative energy and despair. The Secret is simple to understand but extremely difficult to attain. It is however, worth the effort. I would also recommend that you read \\"Always Remember: If It Ain't Fun, It Ain't Worth Doing!\\" as a follow up book.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The intrigue of Christopher Nolan's new film begins with the double meaning of the title, which sets the stage for rival performers who employ doubles to achieve different kinds of prestige. It's an interesting word choice and just one of several uses of wordplay throughout the film. Brewer's Dictionary of Modern Phrase and Fable has this to say about \\"prestige\\":    ¨This word has a strangely metamorphosed meaning. The Latin præstig'iæ means juggling tricks, hence prestidigitateur' (French), one who juggles with his fingers. We use the word for that favourable impression which results from good antecedents. The history of the change is this: Juggling tricks were once considered a sort of enchantment; to enchant is to charm, and to charm is to win the heart.¨    The power of the film derives largely from the novel by Christopher Priest, but Christopher Nolan serves the material well with his wonderfully moody, fragmented film style. It isn't as elegant as the similarly premised The Illusionist, but it is a good deal more complex. Every magic trick, we are told by a voiceover, has a final stage called \\"the Prestige,\\" at which point the audience experiences the full marvel of the presentation. But in the course of the film the word does double duty and more, growing in application until life, love, class, and ambition have built up the term's storied meaning. By the end of the film, though every trick is explained, every betrayal revealed and revenged, the resolution occurs only superficially, leaving the viewer with a series of dyads to puzzle over. The timeline of the narrative is carefully scrambled to accent these oppositions, and key details are withheld here and there, misguiding the viewer in the manner of a magic act. Even the central conflict of the film is not quite the professional rivalry it appears to be, but, rather, one of knowing and wanting to know.    The theme of curiosity and fascination (even in spite of knowing) is emphasized with questions raised by the story. Is our thirst for knowledge, whether through science, obsession, or needling curiosity, a corrupting force? Is a prudent sipping of knowledge a key to happier life (valuing reach over grasp) and therefore more valuable? It is a basic precept of magic - the occult variety - that different things of equal value, of superficial likeness, volume, etc., may be exchanged for one another. There is also the art of magic by stagecraft, which is similarly capable of producing wonder by withholding information. If successful, a viewer is transported by the apparent nature of the trick, and forgets, however briefly, the element of contrivance. The \\"trick\\" becomes \\"natural.\\" Indeed, of all the arts, magic may be the best suited to imitating nature, as it produces an innocent sense of wonder by `featuring' the invisible. This is important in regard to \\"the Prestige\\" because the film makes a point of showing all its elements quite clearly, yet still produces wonder at its implications. Appropriately, the name of the central trick is \\"The Transported Man.\\"    If, as the film suggests, one pretends exchange by doubling, then knowledge of the trick (the hidden double) becomes a liability to wonderment. Once knowledge of the trick is achieved, the only return to the original state of innocence is through an exchange of audience and artist, whereby the artist takes pleasure in the audience's lack of knowledge. In keeping with the film's motif of doubles, both of the principle characters are forced to play audience to each others' magic acts, in order for one of them to become London's most celebrated magician. Hugh Jackman's character is upset upon first seeing Christian Bale's perfect trick \\"The Transported Man,\\" because he thinks the trick is in the wrong hands. The hand he mistakenly disfigures, his aim altered by none other than Bale's hidden self, is symbolically lessened. Bale, Jackman believes, is a brutish showman capable of some form of real displacement (which, as identical twins, he is), but Jackman thinks he lacks the skill and money to achieve the real object of \\"The Transported Man.\\" The object is not exchange, whether real or fabricated, but marvel at the act. This is partly why Jackman dubs Bale's trick \\"the Prestige.\\" Any trick can be called a prestige (French for \\"conjuror's illusion\\"), but a distinction is made here for a trick that is secret-less, for which awe and adoration are consistent and assured. To achieve this sort of magic, both rival magicians must live half-lives: Bale for his limited audience (primarily for two women) and Jackman for his society crowd and dead wife. He says at one point that he doesn't care about his wife, only the prestige, but in this story the effect of enchantment is equated with romantic love.    Ultimately, Jackman employs science to cheat both art (that of his rival) and death (that of his wife). It is fitting that the manner of his wife's death should be instrumental in his achievement of the Prestige, because she embodies the adoration he yearns to give back. For the bereft Jackman, she lives through the exchange of their bodies in the water tank. For the living Jackman, the one born of Tesla's machine, the knowledge of \\"life's misery\\" and that \\"the earth is solid\\" gradually dispels the short-lived applause and returns him to the tank to repeat the same act 100 times over. One can imagine, just barely, Jackman's prestige experience as simultaneously euphoric and agonizing, the two states of breathlessness that Michael Cain describes in the first and second half of the film; once in consolation and later in malice. The momentary double-life necessary for Jackman's execution of the Prestige is eloquently foreshadowed by Bale's gallows execution and simultaneous homecoming.    A philosophically complex and engaging mystery, though it might work just as well or better as a stage production.

B000HC2LIK|5.0|43 yo No qualifications whatsoever as movie critic<br /><br />This is one of my favorite films. I write recalling the first time I viewed it, somewhere in the mid 80's while in the university. The images and hidden messages is something that will captivate you and encourage always to look for some detail that may have been overlooked (trust me this is a movie to be seen)....fantastic images.. and yes.. Vangelis does the soundtrack...atmospheric setting<br /><br />To me geniality of the movie lies in the fact of telling a tragic tell of a group of \\"humanoids\\"- improved biological replicas designed to have amazing physical powers- they were created to do chores and jobs such as soldiers, inter-stellar explorers and \\"pleasure models\\". Replicas have one limitation by design, they cannot live more than 4 years.<br /><br />The replicas are  manufactured by a supercorporation, whose CEO is a genious who still lives in earth (a place mostly inhabited by the degenerate, outcasts and unfit to pass the migration criteria for interplanetary travel).. a group of rebelious replicas want a to meet with their Creator and asks for more life, a request that this mortal god cannot concede... Harrison Ford is a retired \\"skin remover\\" - that is , a policeman in charge of removing replicas- that is forced back to his former job to help take the group of replicas or \\"become little people\\". He is a antiheroe we can quickly relate to.. the world is now a babelistic mixture of tongues, so we hear chinese, spanish and english words as a background of street pappiamento. No I am not going to spoil it for you.<br /><br />At least the replicas have the chance to find their creator- they are moved by our same existencialistic motives, but they are not given the paths of faith to find the answers. What do they want? I guess the same as everyone else, they just want a fair share of life- We have created new slaves whose notion of equality is just to live longer or at least as much as we do.<br /><br />I wonder what would I do if I found my maker and could openly ask for more life, and find out he has limitations on that? A god with limitations, if we could forget the damn Aristotelic and Scholastic tradition of the contradiction of such a term, and we indeed find a god- made into our same image- and listen to his benevolent amorous advice and consolation- but realice that- \\"Yes Virginia (I am so sorry to say)- there is no santa claus\\"-<br /><br />I forgot where I read it, was it Nietche, was it Schopenhauer?, oh well, it goes like this \\" truth can only belong to those who can bear it\\"<br /><br />In spanish sound better \\"La verdad es de quien la pueda soportar\\"<br /><br />So many angles to start an interesting discussion with a group of good friends over a good argentinian Malbec wine.my maker and could openly ask for more life, and find out he has limitations on that?

B000O75F7C|2.0|\\"Welcome to the nightmare ladies and gentlemen! It is a blue nightmare indeed, and a scary one. On the stage, we can find the members of Porcupine Tree, accompanied by the legendary guitarists Alex Lifeson of Rush and Robert Fripp of King Crimson! Welcome.. and SUFFER!\\" <br /> <br />I woke up with sweat tangling down my chin. It was early in the morning and the sun wasn't up yet. I couldn't sleep after this nigtmare because it was the day I was getting my hand on the FoaBP by Porcupine Tree. As I approached the record shop, I could feel my stomach turn upside down because I had Fear of a Nonsense Album.  <br />I put the CD in my stereo, flipped through the pages of my booklet, and felt my journey began... It was an old model plane. I could feel it from the beginning as the first notes from the engine started humming. The riffs of the propeller was shouting \\"Deadwing, Deadwing, Dea..\\" and we took off. The captain began to speak. He said great words, but in a very monotonous way, so it began to bore me. Then he started to sing a little and his melody seemed nice, but I knew this trip from before. This wasn't a deja vu... This was the way of the Deadwing!  <br />I woke up and found that I already passed to the second song. I heard the intro and said \\"Damn I was going to listen to the PT album, not Led Zeppelin's \\"House of the Holy\\" album!\\" I stood up and checked the CD, but it was PT. What a coincidence, I said, and continued to listen. It was a song a la Feel So Low and Heart Attack in a Layby. Skip.  <br />The third song. I was shivering, because I was about to hear how Alex Lifeson contributed to this album, and it was the longest song PT ever made. The song started great, but then became a little boring, but then held itself together. Alex Lifeson really added a lot with his great guitar riffs and it was amazing to hear the beautifl melodies. 17 minutes passed quick.  <br />Fourth movement... Skipped instantly! The worst song PT has ever written. A copy-paste of Lazarus and Collapse the Light into the Earth, ended with the exact same riffs from Trains from In Absentia album, with a twist on the solo that came after it (if you can call it a twist, IF you can even call it a SOLO, just bunch of notes played)  <br />Fifth degree... Again something original in the guitar and drum solos, because Robert Fripp is in the play. Other than that, I still have this feeling that I have heard this song somewhere else before...  <br />The final... Sleep Together and Stop Swimming really remind each other by their names.. well here is the new deal: they even resemble each other by the flavor. Take one earful of Stop Swimming, increase its speed, add more repetitions, make it a little bit heavier in tune, add more synths... and Ta-daa! Your Sleep Together is ready to serve! <br /> <br />I started bleeding because I was pinching myself to wake up from this nightmare.. but it wasn't a nightmare, it was the reality itself. You can call this a compilation album for PT as it offers nothing new but some smooth melodies and an original idea of having two great guitar heroes accompany them. If it wasn't for them, this album could have stopped swimming and drown forever! The best thing about the album was Davin Garrison's drums: he really showed his full potential, but the album cancelled his efforts. The worst thing was the album itself, but Richard Barbieri was Way Out of Creativity himself as he added nothing but bunch of strings and some easy synth effects at the last song. Yes, this album can sound brilliant to those that just began to hear PT since it has the original soud that PT has and beautiful vocals of Steven Wilson, but it is not original at all, and you can even hate one of the songs in the album, which is unlike the previous PT albums. PT fans like me, just stay away and get it from a friend that made the mistake of buying it. Newcomers.. you will just throw the CD out of the window after you hear Deadwing and In Absentia and see what these guys can do!
B00006AW2J|4.0|While country rock might be a nauseating term in the wrong hands, the Stones laid down an amazing mix of acoustic and country flavors atop a sturdy and weathered blues and rock foundation to create a splendid album.<br />This recording is chock-full of FM radio classics but it is in some of the less popular areas that the band really shines. No Expectations features one of Brian Jones most meaningful and, sadly, last contributions to the band's history with his easy going and smooth slide work. Jigsaw Puzzle shows some of the Dylan influence that nearly every band had to feel during this period of rock history, and Parachute Woman is a chugging acoustic blues exercise. As for the staples, Street Fighting Man has some of the most disquieting acoustic work ever laid down and Sympathy for the Devil, well...what can you say? I like how Jagger sums up the true nature of his influence with his straight forward and hippie jolting line in Street Fighting Man about how little the band can do about the times except to continue playing rock and roll. Stray Cat Blues features a murky leaden guitar sound; a scary, chugging, and threatening reverberation of menace. Factory Girl, Salt of the Earth, and Prodigal Son are also excellent acoustic driven numbers and have more country soul than the entire multitude of flag-waving, cowboy-hat sporting clowns who call themselves country nowadays.<br />Among some of the greatest Stones' songs included herein, this album also demonstrates how valuable and vital Keith Richards is as a guitarist. He may not play with lightning speed and his lead work is limited at best, but his unique and hypnotic rhythym style and his undeniable gift for melody and song crafting are second to none in my book. If I had to pick one guitarist to start a band with, this guy is at the top of the list.
B000089RV6|5.0|Of course, In my humble opinion, this album is in my Top Ten of all-time. It rocks, it's bluesy,crushing, sneering and has that \\"I'm badder than you attitude.\\" And it's just a lot of FUN. Really, what more could you want in a Rock album? Get your hands on this bad boy!!!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Like some strange mixture of Neil Young, Roy Orbison, Bruce Springsteen, and The Killers. The music is pretty simple, but its basis of combining unused orchestral instruments such as the harp, and adding accordion, steady drums, and some strings... mash this all up with guitar and you've got a something that really shouldn't be - something that works. This music is a little more straightforward than say Sufjan Stevens. But like that genius, Arcade Fire assembles just a wonderful album out of disparaging elements.
B000KCHWCM|5.0|David Bowie-Hunky Dory *****<br /><br />Hunky Dory by David Bowie is easily the best lyricly written album of all time! Long concedered Bowie's best album next to, The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars. Released in 1971, just before Ziggy, and right after the hard rocking, The Man Who Sold The World. As metioned The Man Who Sold The World is a hard rock album, with heavy piledriving guitars by Mick Ronson. Where as The Man Who Sold The World was a rare album in Bowie cannon, so is Hunky Dory. This is an almost all acoustic guitar album, and mainly a pianon fueled effort. To me David Bowie never before or since wrote better songs then he did here, the lyrics are nothing short of amazing! Bowie vocals shine through beautifuly. Mick Ronson's acoustic guitar work still amazes as well as his great arrangements. A real treat is the feature yes keyboardist Rick Wakemen's piano playing.<br /><br />Hunky Dory opens with the all time Bowie classic, 'Changes' which for most people is the first Bowie song that people ever heard. Though the song was not a hit it still to this day is played on the radio and is concedered a classic among classics! 'Oh, You Pretty Things' is one of the best songs on the album, with a nice catchy chorus and a great rythmicly sung verse that sounds really cool. I think Bowie wrote this song about himself. 'Eight Line Poem' is exactly what its called, the poem really doesnt make since but the guitar intro by Mick Ronson is absolutly stunning. 'Life On Mars' is one of David Bowie's all time best songs. Featuring one of his all time best chorus' and lyrics, it's really a shining moment in music history. 'Kooks' is a cheesey song about his daughter I think, it's really catchy. The next song contains some of the best lyrics ever written by anyone, 'Quicksand' is just down right amazing, and fantastic, and any other good word you could use to describe it. 'Fill Your Heart' is a cover song, that I dont really like to much, I mean its ok every once in a while but it's deffinatly not one of my favorite songs on the album. I love 'Andy Warhol' this song has one of the coolest chorus' ever. The songs lyrics are really great, and this song also features one of the all time best guitar riffs, Mick Ronson never fails to amaze me. Also the intro to this song where Bowie tells the guy in the soundboard how to say Warhol. 'A Song For Bob Dylan' is another cool song and it's about.... you guessed it Bob Dylan. 'Queen Bitch' was really a sign of things to come, it is straight up glam-rock, before there was even glam-rock proven that once again David Bowie is and always has been ahead of his time, the damn genius! The album closes with the epic 'The Bewlay Brothers' which is a long acoustic jam with great lyrics and amazing vocals by Bowie. I glad this is the song the end the album because it eases you out perfectly.<br /><br />Hunky Dory is with out a doubt one of the all time best albums, certainly one of Bowies brightest moments. As I said before the lyrics and phnomenal. So as I think of a group of people to recomend this album to I can only say, I recomend this album to anyone because it is that good and fans of any kind of music would enjoy this, well except for rap!to much, I mean its ok every once in a while but it's deffinatly not one of my favorite songs on the album.
