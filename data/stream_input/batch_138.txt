B000E4SQIA|5|Perfect fit. Everything was great.
B0027QWNI2|4|Good quality
B000XG8Q0W|5|They help me keep the backseats of my car clean. They work well--kind of hard for them not to.
B009XEVCTM|5|Finally a product that works.  I had 2 spots on an antique serving tray and the copper was starting to show through.  I followed the directions and coated the area at two different times.  The area looks 99% better.  I would highly recommend this product!
B00V5XYG9W|5|ZFE team delivered the part quickly, with free postage, and the kill cord was as they described.  I would buy again from them.
B0041CC9LQ|5|Pads are awesome, now I can brake where I want to. 2 thumbs up
B007V433CA|1|Absolute junk u bolts do not fit in flat end mounts. Do not buy
B00OBZ9H4A|5|Awesome, great, love it
B00QI02DVA|3|Started falling apart after the first week.
B005R4KXUG|5|very nice item easy to install and just plug and play
B00873J0YY|4|Good value, but one of the straps was damaged in production.  The wholesaler has been responsive in getting it replaced.  I'm sure some of the name brand racks are a bit better built, but they would have been 4-6 times the price overall.
B00LBAFY04|1|These bulbs turned out to be the wrong size, 9006 Not 9012.
B001CX0WX4|5|Have changed the engine oil in my car once so far with this through the dipstick. It was awesome.
B000C5YCJ8|5|Worked  as expected
B00WAORQHE|3|Good product
B004GFTC0E|5|Great kit! Restored my headlights from some deep scratches.<br />Really happy I did not buy the manual kit but wished I had protected the bumper better.
B004QC9SRY|5|on time works well have two of them from amazon
B00II9QCEI|5|Easy to install and great quality
B000F232BW|5|Nice fit to my 1999 Dodge 3500 Van
B00GMQ37II|1|not what was described...<br /><br />Was unable to use these as described.
B003XJ6MGG|5|I have one of these in the back of my van and I never hear it clunk and it never drives funny, sometimes I wonder if its there because it is very smooth.  The best part is that it delivers the power to the wheel with traction so one doesn't just sit there spinning a tire and going nowhere, if one of my rear wheels has traction my van goes!
B005JCY7RG|5|Seems to be heavy duty and was very easy to install--per the instructions.
B000EDOT8C|5|stays on stove with vehicle in motion.  great to add more work space. set it up behind stove when cooking serves as a splash shield then.
B00EVMT6A8|1|Objects are so small and appear very far away when in reality they're pretty close.
B00FDQPCR2|4|fast shipping and easy to install
B000BRMYN8|5|Replaced plastic Car Stops that would slide frequently. These have weight and do not slide. Love, love, love them.
B005NLQAHS|4|The OBD2 Scan tool is pretty awesome if you have OBD2. I live outside US and our car is JOBD (Toyota OBD). The OBD adapter was not compatible with the car's ECU. Although there are a few work around for an OBD2 adapter to work with JOBD. One thing I really liked was their customer service. Although they were not aware of this incompatibility but the customer service representative was more than helpful in assisting me. Plus with the work around this adapter actually worked with older Toyota cars but no the new ones.
B00M78820I|1|Did not fit a jumbo windshield like described!
B000ZIC18Q|3|Works great!!
B002VIAF90|5|Fit right into our Durango and work great.  No issues at all
B00Z6P2R00|5|Great items
B000VKPS5G|5|It is just a cabin air filter for my automobile, but at a significant savings over the price the oil change people wanted! Plus I did not have to get back out in the heat to go get it. Amazon took care of a quick delivery at a decent price.
B00PGH5U6Q|5|Bought this for my Mazda 3 2015. Well made case, stitching is good, leather quality seems pretty good, the keys align well (yes there is no hole for panic button but I knew this going in). Very happy with it in fact i will be buying another one!!
B00062YBJI|5|It's Edelbrock, as good as it gets.
B001G4Z5J0|1|This DOES NOT fit on a 2015 wrangler. I used the check box and it said it would, but you can't open the gate with the rack attached if you have the standard tire on the gate. I wish I had known this.
B00H8T82X8|5|I've had these for about 3 months now. Easy application and I havent had any problems with them.
B001EYDSZU|5|Works well even at high speeds. Install was a bit of work and one might consider a transom mount if room or mechanical talent is a issue.
B007MUY76O|5|Works as expected.  I returned mine because they were too long but that was my fault
B00RUDX6S8|3|Came as described only issue to note is the screws are too short if you don't press it on to the fork tubes real good before trying to install the screws in a delicate manner it will pull the threads out of the housings
B009DJRWCS|5|I haven't installed it yet, but it looked nice plus it came with the bulb socket insert
B003U4RS1M|5|Use it in my Mini Coopers. All Good!!
B00JLASS4A|1|Didn't last long
B00CMT6GZ0|5|Works great no complaints
B004I0Z486|5|Great
B00EKN8FXC|5|Lights work great in my RV
B00L7X8HWC|2|Ok quality oem light plugs don't fit that well not bad but won't buy again
B004A2GOK4|5|Product as described works well OEE  filter
B001CCJIGM|2|I bought this because it was supposed to be an exact fit for my Crown Victoria...  Technically, it works, but not as the instructions said.  It is designed and the instructions are written for a vehicle with a separate amber colored parking light/turn signal, separate from the brake lights.  It has an extra wire that I wound up not using, and the instructions did not work with my vehicle at all - I had to think through the circuits to figure it out.
B00BQYCKE8|2|No better than others I have used, and not as good as some I bought when they first came out.. RC
B0055AW0N0|4|Bought this for my mother, as she doesn't have a beverage holder in her older Mercedes-Benz.. She likes it!
B0000AY69V|5|It's a very helpful tool it can get almost anything dry, I like them
B000KYXC7Y|2|Could not be programmed.
B00SJTS08S|5|ordered on a Saturday and arrived on Wednesday. Which is way faster then what they said. As far as the sound it is a very deep and throaty. The best sounding pipes for a victory I have heard to date. I am very Happy with this purchases. Highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!
B00XVZYTLM|5|Light worked great .worth every penny
B00H89ERG4|5|I got this for my Garmin 2757LM & it fits perfectly. All the necessary holes align as they're suppose to & I like the built-in sun visor<br /><br />I added the RAM mount ball adapter. This will be used on my Harley when I travel :-)
B00AC7JPLQ|5|Wow! Bought this for my dad for Father's Day, but ordered too small of a size. When I tried to return it they promptly called me and offered to replace it with another size! I measured the window and let them know the size I needed, and exchanged it. I am so happy with this! The old one my dad had on his window he could barely see through which made it impossible backing the trailer or boat up. This one you can see through almost perfectly! And the design is amazing! Thank you thank you thank you!!
B01092IEEM|5|Very nice product.
B00X53SCHC|3|I replaced the broken piece on the passenger side of the car the day I received it since it was missing. It's my daughters car so I don't see it everyday, however I went to replace the driver side today and notice the P/S mirror cap has turned a gold looking color (right at 30 days). Out of the box the paint looks good and the fit finish was good for the price paid. Photos attached.
B00ADFB1DC|5|Extremely fast shipping and durable quality!
B0048J1JVI|5|Best replacement brand. Much stronger than the aftermarket I bought for the driver side that I had to beef up to keep from bending.
B00U7YQM0G|5|Good quality, prompt shipping, wish it had Dolphins on it
B000C8R9OU|5|Fits! right parts
B00VO848EQ|5|Some body can put pic
B000AMW0GA|5|the best price & fast shipping.
B001S8Q174|5|works & fits perfectly!
B00N306VXY|5|Fits well and leaves room for year/month registration stickers on the plate
B00F9VU910|5|I would definitely recommend this product for those who need a fuel pump for their b15 chassis.
B000K7JHWA|4|I used the motion pro on a Suzuki outboard motor with three carbs. It worked great was a little bouncy but the motor runs good. It beats a 500.00 carb repair from the marina. This is the first time I have worked on a motor with multiple carbs.
B000YS9P54|5|easy to use, traveled well, kept temperature sensitive medicines cool in 100 degree outside heat in the car.
B0083G3AXC|1|Make sure the part that hooks to your chair is correct for your chair! Will be returning and trying again
B0033QQ4VW|5|Just what I needed for My Mini Cooper.
B00QLTQDAU|1|Incorrect springs.
B00NJ008MI|5|Excelent, thanks.
B003TODXQW|5|Worked great.  Installed over 45 1/4 nutserts in a jk jeep.  No problems
B007OTGZEK|5|Product as described not sure how it will hold up over time
B003EP52BU|5|Simple and effective product. Well worth the money
B001EAWOE0|3|Only reason for a 3 star is selector switch was broken. I fixed it with a trip to radio shack. Other wise works great!!!  Sound quality is top notch no static works great with Bose radio. I have a 4s iPhone and volume level is fine for me.  Really is a plug and play addon
B006B2XAUS|5|Fits perfectly.
B0044B0Z06|5|Simple install.  Why overpay your dealer for this part and the service when you can do it yourself in 5 minutes?
B00GJ5U8FM|5|The files work really well, would recommend
B004UPZXQM|5|Love this.  Use it after every wash.  Makes paint smooth to the touch.
B00DFANZNG|5|Work's great
B003ELZSTK|5|fit just like they said,installed in about 20 min. very easy. very happy Thanks Roger
B00KGIDFNU|5|Works great
B00UW4DJF2|1|Hardly used it, but it died after 2 months, looks like warranty was good for only one month.  Pretty expensive to have no warranty.
B00KTLLJP0|5|If your 3rd gen TL has dim or faulty brake lights, this is the module you need. It is easy to install, and now my car has bright brake lights. You might be looking for the older model number, but this is the same part, just with an updated model number.
B00WSV900A|5|Works well, keeps the bug splatter down
B00CDAFT6K|3|Not the quality expected for the price. These aren't bad but they are definitely not great. The shades are very thin and doesn't provide enough protection due to the fact that they still let a lot of sin get through.
B00FUZRG66|5|Seems to be pretty good quality but it is a royal PAIN to put back together! Had no trouble getting the key blank cut for free at the local ace hardware. You have to remove 2 screws to take the unit apart, then transfer over your old remote's circuit board, battery holder and battery. Re-installing the key is a little tricky, but I found if you put in the bottom screw about 3/4 of the way you can fit the key, spring and button assembly in place. Make sure the spring gets put back in the correct position so it'll pop out like it's supposed to. All in all it took about 10 minutes to put it back together. On mine, the key wouldn't pop out all the way when pressing the button, but a little WD-40 fixed it right up.
B00IJZQ1E2|5|very good quilty!
B001UCGE4S|5|Good parts comes with plenty of sealant
B000H8QCHK|5|Perfect fit
B008VLVDII|4|It would be nice if it was designed with the sides extended over the sides of the car seat. The sides tend to fold up as the pet moves around the back seat. This is true with all car seat covers. Like the heavy material. Prevents dog hairs and spills from seeping through.
B00FSCAVJ0|5|Works perfect x thanks
B0046BHXO0|5|I needed something to put my car key on and this is perfect. It's a nice size and good quality.
B006H34BUY|5|Great for car interior, especially cup holders.
B0065V1ENU|5|The belt was the best.
B00J62SM1M|5|easy A+++
B00HFQ8VOY|4|worked as intended
B00SH1SN6C|5|I've bought numerous RavPower devices and have not been disappointed yet. Their products are quality stuff. This battery pack /auto battery jumper gives me no reason to change my opinion. Works perfectly!
B00WPHVKS2|5|Wonderful customer service! And large, beautiful decal! Absolutely love it and the seller was extremely nice and easy to communicate with! Prompt with responding and very helpful!
B000AP6RCA|5|I put the filter in my V6 mustang. I'm not sure if its gained a huge amount of horsepower, but I do feel a difference in the higher gears. Sounds a little better to, definitely more air getting to the engine.
B006ORF3BY|4|I put on my cycle then took it off, I put on my bro's cycle.<br />I bought an atv windshield, it covers more area.
B00LUKWYQ2|4|Ordered and installed on my friends Yamaha Raptor 660 ATV.  He is going to ship it to Jamica where he is from to keep at his house.  You can legally operate ATV's on the street as long as thy have signal lights & a horn + tail / brake light.  The atv already has a brake and tail light so I ordered this + a horn, universal LED signal lights and wire to create the harness.  I wish the install of lights was more standardized and &#34;kits&#34; existed even universal ones but my research shows that not to be the case.  I did see some kits but they cost over $200 and are still universal.  I will update later with a complete list of parts and maybe a link to a photo of the ATV with everything installed.
B00IKJ7ZS8|5|Worked great.My old rotors worry pitted bad and made growling sound . Nice and quiet now. Would buy again.
B008YID7JQ|5|Perfect fit and no leaks. I watched a YouTube video and installed them without issues.
B0016I7LZM|5|Just what I expected, and according to my needs
B00NS1IA78|5|Easy to install, fits like a glove
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Installed easy enough.  While on your workbench, align the rear washers over the holes and &#34;tack&#34; them in place with a drop of supper glue on the outside edge..  Will save you a ton of time during install.  Also grab a a roll of duct tape and tape the bolts to your wrench.
B00EI6CKVE|2|Love the sticker, but it's made cheaply and doesn't stick very well.
B0031HEIDY|1|Does not fit my 2009 VW Jetta as it said it would.
B0006303O4|4|Sturdy design, so far has not ripped like the cheap ones do, 1 month into use
B000C2EDRC|5|Been using FelPro products for many years.  This one was a perfect fit, thin layer of PVC on top and bottom of the gasket and it's bullet proof.
B00FBKWNN6|1|Please don't buy straight up garbage
B003S72W3U|1|I returned it. It did not fit the back seat at all we have a 2015 so maybe better for older models, but it did not work for us
B0124HWGNA|3|Front bumper guard came in after it was ordered yesterday. Company delivery was fast. However there was a lot of rust coming out from inside of the tube. Installation was easy. If it were not for the rust it would of been 5 stars.
B003CEFJ2A|2|Ripped while putting on lift I give it three stars because out of three covers this is first to go bad before a couple yrs I'd return it but I move in 2 days and won't get a new one in time
B0012PUUB6|1|Thay look used rust all around shock only got bolts no air line hoses<br />sending back
B003K038PG|5|High quality, brilliant shine and worked out perfectly for my Car project. be aware that the included clamp does not have a shine to it at all, I ended up using another 2&#34; chrome boltable exhaust sleeve.
B00NJ9MZH0|5|Great item, fast shipping.
B00WT2FBXS|5|BEST HITCH I HAVE EVER OWNED! Great design, not too flashy and locking pins that use box keys so they don't break.<br /><br />Put on 2014 F350 Crew Long Box stock height. Can't have more than 8&#34; drop with stock truck. Left me with 10&#34; clearance to ground no load/ trailer. Would be better to use 6&#34; drop stock. 8&#34; will be perfect for 2.5&#34; lift with 2 sizes larger tires. (in other words truck goes up 3.5&#34; bringing bed rail to 60&#34; at back which is max for 5th wheel towing).
B00ANR0L36|5|Exactly what I wanted!
B00WFIMJQ8|5|I am very happy with the product did more than I expected works great boast my horse power like it said.
B00KSMCFOO|4|Put it on my DR650SE stock seat, way better.
B00QF1BGF6|4|Came before delivery date, and works perfect.
B0002YS344|5|Love this mug so much I ordered more of them.  I like to drink coffee/tea out on the concrete patio.  I don't need to worry about glass with these lightweight mugs and they are kind to my arthritic hands.  They are perfect and do just great in the dishwasher.
B00JQYNRIS|5|This item works exceedingly well in my Motorhome, for long distance trips. As a diabetic, I need to have snacks and drinks readability available when I do long trips, and this item sits next to me in the cockpit. It cools down quickly, and uses very little power. I also have one of these in my jeep, for when I go off-roading.
B007V2DTIA|5|For those of you complaining about the visors not holding it in place TIGHTEN THE HINGES or get a better car/truck. It works as intended on my truck.
B0039HH2EI|5|very good fit ty
B00NS1IA78|5|Sort of a project to install, but the instructions are great, with pictures, written by a native English speaker.
B0044B30TO|5|GOODS
B000TYTS3C|1|I give this product one star because it shows the gasket in the picture. Upon receiving it,no gasket. Reading the description it says no gasket.My fault but I was misled by the picture.
B002XYT2HI|4|This works fine, spliced in near the main harness, the only issues was because of limited space it was hard to push the clips in frame holes, use Vaseline and a rubber mallet where you can. Otherwise it would be 5 stars. A lot cheaper than Auto Parts stores for same part.
B005BT90DI|5|Quality, industrial grade product I can use again and again to bleed out my hydraulics systems.
B00TS0IJ7E|4|This helmet is very nice looking, DOT approved. All around it's a nice helmet but I thought it had Bluetooth but it doesn't. The other reviewer purchased it somewhere else
B005GHB5U6|5|Love it!!
B0085G9V7E|5|highly recommend it easy to install love it
B009XR2798|5|It's a PITA to install but sucks tailpipe very well.
B0007ZULM0|5|Unbelievable product, truly. This stuff smells incredible, instantly nourishes leather seats, does not make them shine or sticky and looks fantastic. This is what I've always wanted in a leather care product. Thank goodness I finally found it. My coworkers love this stuff too. Why, you ask? We take turns driving to lunch and when they ride with me after I've used Optimum on my seats, the entire trip there and back is about how good my car smells inside. Oh, and it's very fresh and leathery without being too strong or synthetic like many other products I've tried. Buy this stuff. Thank me later. Great job, Optimum!
B007CX6I04|3|not is sturdy as OEM
B00N3VYMJ8|5|A very good product smooth a good well made. Comfortable , good material
B00JONUB8A|3|I really love the decal but I got it with no instructions at all.  I have no idea how to put it on and have not figured it out yet.  some people say the go instructions and a practice decal... I wish I did!!
B0082365AQ|3|good theory,but the straps that came with it would not stay tight,if you buy this plan on buying two sets of small ratchet straps
B004GCTC66|4|Works good has been in for a little more than a month with no issues yet. Just make sure you check you old assembly first. My orginal assembly was secured with 6 bolts, the new one secures with 4 bolts and has 2 threaded studs. I was caught off guard and had to go to the store to get nuts and washers no big deal. Holes lined up perfectly.
B0082XHE1U|2|Got the crash bar for my 04 shadow aero and the dang thing had more scratch and chips in the chrome along with rust than my whole bike did.
B00522TQW4|5|Excellent quality and shipped in a small box. No wrinkles or creases in the decal. Heavy vinyl with bold, well defined graphics. Use Rapid-Tac and their surface pre-treatment solution for excellent bonding and positioning flexibility along with a 3M plastic decal squeegee to remove air bubbles and excess Rapid-Tac solution. VERY IMPORTANT--let decal dry 1 hour before removing carrier paper and be certain to pull the paper back on to itself or at a very sharp angle.
B00FMITNA8|1|Not very bright, hard to see in the daytime.
B004H78NQ0|1|As others have noted, not OEM equipment - Chinese knockoff.  More importantly, these are metal stem caps and not suitable for TPMS.......
B003CH3Z8W|4|Works good
B00CSHYHH0|5|A must for any bike
B0094V9OKS|5|Great +++
B001T9JW9Q|5|Awesome...fits like a glove!!!!
B002RNFP3A|4|Works good.
B00ODI7K5I|1|Mal, queda horrible.
B00LN3QE9O|4|good lights
B00CAJ6O4A|3|Made of a very cheap plastic. And not as glossy as the picture. Looks ok from afar
B00AZMICIA|5|It works in my 2000 BMW 740il. However the factory once wasn't bad. Turns out that problem was corrosion on my ECM where the wire plug into it. If you swap this out and still have a code showing then you need to check your ECM. That's it's plane and simple. This wires directly into the ECM.
B006H34BUY|5|This thing is great.  I purchased it for under $10 on Amazon a few months ago and keep it in my car to clean off the dash and interior.  Anyone who likes to keep their cars clean needs one of these. It would be a great stocking stuffer too.  I hate seeing all that dust build up on my dash especially when I am driving into the sun.  This little duster has exceeded my expectations and I haven't had to wash it yet.  Its been a few months now.  All I do to clean it out is just smack it against my hand a few times and its all clean again.
B00B86B58Q|5|Fit perfectly in my 2014 Passat
B0000AY3DS|3|Not the best, the image looks funny like the circus mirrors when looking into it, but for the price you can tell if someone fell off the tub or board.
B000EQAVRC|5|It is the perfect FORD replacement part for my old pump that was broken in an accident.
B0009TCR8A|5|It does the trick
B00ALGA16Q|5|Awesome thanks
B000GZQC6K|1|You need a extra module which is not available.
B009DNW3Y6|5|Installed and work fine
B00J04031I|1|Junk
B00D6N0CTW|5|good side marker
B00DJ5KE9A|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B001544JKW|5|Put these on a 1973 Gator trailer and saved money. Went to the bearings home page to find out what a SET14 bearings where and save buying the racer and bearing set than buying them one at a time.
B00B2YHFO2|5|I bought in the past month different sets of this lights and they look very cool and very bright
B00KKO0HTA|5|Works great
B0081KM734|4|Works fine. You will want amber if you are using primarily in the day.
B00CJA0QM6|5|Great
B003SYXQTW|5|I have a 2000 Dodge Dakota R/T with the 5.9L magnum 360. This idler pulley is a bit wider but it cleared everything and it installed perfect. I am not gonna bash it just because it's made in China. As long as the quality control is good, I don't care.<br /><br />So far I am happy with it and I hope it lasts a long time.
B001UG4WIO|5|Very neatly cut and nice design
B0110U377G|1|After reading about the wide angle view of 170 degrees and many features, including nice looks, I chose this model from many many other choices.<br />The package arrived intact and complete. This was my first dashcam purchase.  Installation was a breeze. Unfortunately, the video was very out of  focus, hazy and blurry. It was as if the camera was suffering from milky cataracts.  I checked the lens over and over to see if it was smudged. It was clean but I still attempted to wipe it gently with a SLR lens wipe.  The lens was spotless but still produced very blurry video.  I even cleaned the windshield ... but still blurry.  I pointed the camera out the side window opening with the window rolled down, still very blurry video.<br /><br />I concluded that the problem with the camera was obvious ... the camera was defective on delivery. It happens ... but I was disappointed because I was looking forward to having this unit up and running in the family car.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I'll take another chance with the same model in the hopes of getting a working unit.  I think that I'll take my chances with a dashcam that has more reviews.
B00TQHHCTK|4|Works fine. Did not hold pressure first couple of times, after that worked okay.
B003TESNQM|2|Does not fit 1988 k2500/350 tbi engine. Quality piece just make sure it fits..
B00H39MX6U|5|This seems like a very solid set of hammers, but I have not been able to take it to the junk yard to test it out. If I do get the chance to test it out I will update this review.
B000A0C9P4|2|Even though this air filter is suppose to fit a 1967 Triumph Spitfire per manufacturer, will not fit.
B00HE670DS|5|To be honest, my truck was painted orange and didn't know if this was the correct color. After trying it out, and almost a month later, the color is pretty spot on. Maybe a tad lighter but yet again it might be that my truck isn't the same color as this. Would buy again and worked great
B001O07IK0|5|It was exactly what I wanted. It also arrived 4days early. I had it in before it was the estimated arrival. My nephew liked it and ordered one for his truck also. Very easy to install.
B00OW0NQGE|2|Love it but the leather strap fell off after 3 months
B00823FSRC|5|We looked at a few carriers in canoe & kayak shops that cost $100 and up. Honestly I see very little difference between those and this carrier. We ended up buying two. They seem well made and carry our 14 foot kayaks decently. I replaced the tie down straps with ratchet straps and they hold very securely. Seems to me like these will hold up for years of use.
B000N2U5E6|5|Part holds up good.  I used it on an antique car.
B00GVNQAXQ|1|It's worse than before
B001151E5I|5|By far the best vinyl cleaner and protection on the market.  I will never use anything else.
B008G26UBM|4|Great so far. Bulb connectors a little flemsy. Switched them out. Easy to install looks good.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|Bright lights seem well built
B001DRHMPK|5|OEM Volkswagen oil filter, great quality will continue to use.
B001JL42L2|4|Kinda a pain to install.
B00JIDM47C|1|not the greatest product. backing was very hard to remove and stuck to some of the letter so it was very tedious to remove the backing (had to use a sharp knife to get it off). Needless to say, application was a lot harder and took longer than expected. Have order vinyl signs from other supplies before and the backing usually comes off much easier. smaller letters are also not cut very precisely
B0018085EE|5|High quality  steel and welds. It worked perfect for getting rid of rasp from my scion tc.
B005O25CXE|1|Installed properly on my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and the driver side vent flew off on the freeway so now I am without one! Very upset by this and these vents need to have a tighter fit.
B00ZJ8S2HG|5|Package was shipped very quickly and was super simple to install.  The bars make a bit of wind noise when I'm driving at higher speeds but otherwise are great!  A really good buy for the money.  We'll be using them to attach our kayak racks and They'll be perfect.
B007J7G1TG|4|Works good. Will purchase again.
B00BB1U6WE|5|good quality.
B001PRX7WK|5|Made it possible for me to drive!
B007TY7PUI|5|Part worked fine. Much better made
B007T9ER5O|1|This tool wound not fit over the grease fitting.  Maybe it should have been sold with a different attachment but I couldn't make it work.
B00T9LR9FA|5|Using it on our bathroom mirrors.  It works.  Next we'll try our vehicles.  It is summer so not a lot of need yet for Idaho.
B00571A21O|3|The product is mounted with 4 small allen wrench screws that are very difficult to tighten adequately enough to keep them from moving when weight is applied. The design makes what should be only minutes to apply to hours.  Ills the mounts themselves but mounting them was ridiculous cause of the way it was designed...
B00CQ8EDSY|5|works well
B007BKPVDI|4|good price fast shipping
B008I9SR46|2|The helmet looks good my wife was happy but I don't think it's to safe. The vents don't stay opened. For what you pay for its ok.
B000E4ON7S|5|good product, quick delivery!
B002P8JJ2U|5|Just perfect
B00KFMHAH4|5|Great racks. As expected. East to install. Looks fantastic.
B00BVL7W1C|5|Worked well on my manual tire mounter.
B003P4MN2G|4|Looks nice. Works well. Finish scratches easily though
B00CLV5LC8|5|Looks great on my car everyone keeps stopping and asking me where did i get it from kids love it DECEPTICONS RULE!
B00FGR8Y4G|2|These are plastic cheap ones with a short shaft so if u want to put them on a harley they won't fit
B000EQPAQO|2|this is the second one and the mechanic is telling me that this part is faulty as well. I am waiting to decide i I should purchase one from another source and see if my car will work properly and then ask for a refund. That is the only way to prove or disprove if is the part that is faulty.
B002QBNH9W|5|JUNK!!!!  Made the bike 3mph slower....I'm sending it back!
B00EEMJBYQ|5|Love
B004VROJ32|5|Works great. Just as it is intended. Works best at highway cruising speeds of 70+
B00651C998|1|REDUCE HD STATIONS HAD PUT THE OTHER BACK ON
B00DJDYN80|5|It outperforms all brands of 134a; and it's the only automotive refrigerant that also works in the older R-12 systems.
B005A3YO54|5|Fit perfectly on my 2009 Saturn Outlook (driver's side rear).  Matches factory reflector on passenger side.
B002WH7B0G|5|worked as it should
B0022Y2DC0|5|Awesome product looks good too
B004BS0M50|5|Outstanding product. With a lift this is a 2hr. Install. Without a lift it pushes 5 hrs.
B00OXWZ0VU|4|Worked very well to eliminate &#34;Check Engine Light&#34;
B00RKOCAKW|4|great product. got it sooner than expected
B001O0CLPW|4|They blend in with the original tire nuts on my 2015 Honda Fit.
B007XKDJEE|3|The smell of this thing straight out of the package is HORRENDOUS. It's an awful rubbery/chemical smell. However after about a week, it seems to have aired out. It does give a good grip to your steering wheel, and it's a cute pink color of course.
B0017K69MA|3|I found this tool very handy cleaning my car's windows, but for car's that have a very low rear window, it doesn't work too well in the nooks and crannys.  Actually, the plastic piece the mits attach to should be a hard type of form, that might cost more, but get the job done.
B010GO1K5S|5|They are very well made, looking forward to taking a trip with them to see if they help. We tried them in our office chair and they seem quite comfortable. Would recommend.
B008HRX7WG|5|Perfect one.
B007XUICDW|4|Used this to replace the starter motor on my 1992 Suzuki sidekick.<br />Works like a charm. Don't know how long it will last but it seems to be built tough.<br />It was half the price of just the solenoid in a local sore so I guess it's worth the risk ;-)
B00FZQ2S7M|5|Excellent and far cheaper than the dealership. Forget the off brand, you will never get it installed. Push supply line through opening in hood and attach to nozzle before pressing in place and your repair is complete.
B009Y06H3Q|5|Fit perfectly for a kitchen sink replacement, though I was glad to have also purchased a universal kit for the sleeve and washers and hose to go with it. Water does not pour straight down, but at slight angle. Pressure is great -- I replaced the hose, too. Good enough for now and no need to completely replace entire faucet. Be sure to match your finish!
B000JZN0CQ|1|Does not fit 2005 Corolla.
B0011V4V6Q|5|I have always used Hawk Pads and will continue to do so. Fitment was perfect like always
B00A8LF8NK|5|Instructions were easy to follow.  Looks GREAT and hopefully it will last for many years.  I will be buying from them again.  Laced Up Decals do excellent work!!
B007VRCTD6|5|This seat has 6 sturdy mounts on the bottom for mounting to a flat surface. The entire seat is very solid and has held up very well in my racing simulator. I can't say that ever had it in a real automobile but I can't see a reason not too. The seat feels ergonomically correct as well but I'm not a doctor. Two thumbs up.
B00E9RSXTU|1|tore in one 20 min ride with no crashes. Knee ripped all the way accross
B00VSC6B8E|5|There isn't much to these (they're just cut and folded frosted plastic sheet), but they are perfect for the times when we are traveling north/south just after/before sunrise/sunset to fill the open gap from the end of the visor to rear edge of the front door windows (as shown in the product photos. I was going to make something out of card stock, but found these first. I think they'll be a lot more durable.
B004O63ALC|5|My wife really loves this vest.  And the shipping was super fast.  Very happy with this purchase.  Thank you.
B007JMTS14|4|Overall a decent set, but the contacts should be able to take a larger size cable than what they are to be a 350 amp capacity.
B00SLKT3MC|4|Not bad for the price paid, but not perfect. Little depression/dimple where internal hardware located. Pretty easy installation.
B000W0OFXG|3|As advertised.  the part that goes into the combination dials is a bit flimsy.  Don't know if it would hold up to a hammer.
B003K04S8M|5|I have now had this setup on my svt focus for about 15000 miles driven entirely in cleveland with horrible pot holes. It has worked great and i wish i would have done it sooner. It has made my car handle way better and it is not so stiff that it is annoying.
B0015PRTLC|5|great product and a very pro active support team
B00IS93NGI|5|Excellent
B005TTZOU8|5|Just what the dr. ordered. With adjusted pinion the is the right way to correct for anti sway bar rub. Built stout as hell.
B011GY6G74|5|I really love these blind spot mirrors! I've had some in the past, but they fell off after a few days, and were basically a waste of money. However, these have been on for a week and I haven't had any problems at all! Makes it super easy to merge into a highway,  or switch lanes, and If I ever get another car and need them, I will be buying them again! These are worth every penny! *I was given this product to review*
B00ISR9XNM|3|My low beam left light stopped working.
B003JBM64A|5|this was real good. thanks and service is great.
B007EERHYM|5|Have had a few friendly salutes (which I don't rate) and thumbs-up thrown at me (which I have returned) since I put this on my truck. Distinctive design.
B00DKDTAG4|5|4 bolts. Be sure you have a fine drive ratchet . Take your time no problems.
B00CHDH2AY|1|Does not fit no way, totally wrong part.
B00LTU1QYO|4|They sure are handy.
B0041QKY8M|5|GREAT LIGHTS.
B005EMBWFQ|5|Increase MPG from 7 - to 7,5 with my 07 Columbia. Covers up itself about in a 2 months.
B00YLWMUPQ|5|Superb.
B00FX961T2|3|This is a great product made in USA.  I bought it so that I could oil my shredder with canola oil without making a mess everywhere.  I used it tonight and could not be happier with it.  It does not leak at all---not even from the nozzle after pumping out oil 5-6 times.  Some reviews claim it leaked everywhere--my message to them is simple: you clearly got a defective product somehow--contact the seller and get a new item or your money back and stop whining--unfortunately defective products happen.  Again, I'm very happy with this product.  I should have bought one years ago!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  P.S.  I tried to buy a generic pistol oiler from a large home improvement store and before I used it I read on the box &#34;contains material that may cause cancer&#34;.  I immediately returned the oiler.  This Goldenrod oiler has no insane warning like that!!! 10/14/15-Update--the lid/cap of the oiler is pitted and I assume it will turn to rust and fall apart.  Very odd that this is happening to an oiler?!  Seems like the lid/cap part that screws on to the base is made of incredibly cheap metal for this to happen--maybe the chrome paint is coming off???  The oiler has been in the house the entire time I've had it because it's for a shredder---has not been exposed to the elements at all!  Reduced score to 3 stars--cheap metal apparently.
B004B61B34|5|Perfect
B00GMH666C|3|Material was thinner than I expected.  Also only came in black (my interior is a dark brown).
B003VGMCGK|5|Great price and arrived as promised ON TIME!<br />Recommend.... Watch a video on YouTube to see how easy it is to do.
B00WDY9X9U|4|Great looking and good quality just a little hard to make it fit perfectly with no holes you have to cut your own holes for the head rests and seat belts.
B003V1AD34|5|the part worked perfectly
B00BLPRMYA|3|Didn't last long - seemed flexible but ended up breaking while cleaning (gently)
B000C42RYG|5|Sorry can't remember, but this replaces either Monroe or Gabriel standard ride shocks.  The ride quality improved by leaps and bounds, lol.  The shocks sold in online stores as factory ride quality or standard ride is an over-statement.  Always choose improved performance.  I'm replacing the fronts with this brand as well.
B008F9J73O|5|Looks Great!!
B007OC9JGI|5|If You want a great oil this is the one for you! I use this in my 94 Firebird and it runs great, thanks!
B005ZGLGF2|5|nice item
B00432S99U|1|Received package, no visible damage, installed per instructions, let charge 3 days per instructions, pressed power button - nothing..... Retuning for warranty, will let you know how that goes....
B00076QA4C|3|good
B00N3OWUI0|4|Like the product, will buy from this seller again.
B001C60344|5|What can't you order from Amazon??? I talked my boyfriend into working on my car as it was not always starting when I turned the key. This product came quickly, as described. My car has worked fine ever since. Much cheaper than a mechanic!
B00HU6N3LK|5|Excellent product.
B00JXYHN6S|5|Was to bed
B00CXYVKKA|5|I've had no less than 5 people suggest me buying this (my nickname has been t-rex for years after an incident at my old job) so I finally found it on here and purchased it. Great quality decal, came with very easy to understand instructions and has gotten a lot of attention so far.
B000E6710C|5|that was awsone I give you guys a 10
B00A0GN3R6|5|Was in desperate need of an extra horsepower so I purchased not one... but TWO of these bad boys. Now I'm a clear 400 horsepower ahead of the competition.
B001T195BE|3|This is a Lemforder tie rod end with rubber dampening as stated in the product title and is OEM for an Audi. However as of now the product notes state &#34;solid steel version without rubber&#34;. I went by the notes for my '03 S6 which takes the solid steel. Actually any car that takes the rubber style can upgrade to the steel versions for longer service life as the rubber deteriorates. Steering wheel feedback will increase which can be good or bad depending on your preference.<br />Fortunately Amazon returns are painless and I am returning them.<br />1 star for the misleading description, but 5 stars for Leforder quality at the lowest price (if you need the rubber dampening style). Hopefully Amazon will edit the product notes and this review will be irrelevant. If Amazon edits the description I'll revise the rating to 5 stars.<br />I am rebuilding the rest of my tired front suspension (175k miles) with Lemforder control arms and sway bar links. More expensive than the cheaper import parts, but much less than factory prices with the same quality. All my parts including these tie rod ends came with new hardware and were identical to the original parts down to the markings save the Audi rings which had been ground off.<br />For all the time and effort involved and the amount I am saving by doing it myself (well over $1k) the extra spent on Lemforder parts is well worth it as I plan on keeping the car.
B000BQKBP2|5|Picked one of these up to replace my old cap. The old cap had two problems - first, the gasket was long-gone, and second, it had only two &#34;hooks&#34; on the bayonet connection instead of four.<br /><br />The Camco has good gaskets, a solid fit, and four &#34;hooks&#34; to create a snug fit on the bayonet connection. All in all, far superior to what I had before.
B00K889FCI|1|truly a waste of money.
B001GJ3E2K|5|Works great. It was so easy to get in those crevices in the wheel.
B000C7VYVU|5|Bought it and had it installed by my mechanic.<br />It works. (I don't have any means to measure how much cooler my vehicle runs, the other had leaks)<br />Mechanic had no problems installing it.<br />Fits my 2002 Dodge Dakota Sport (as such, it should fit 2001-2004 models and certain Durango years)
B006H34BUY|5|Works well to pick up dust/lint on black car interior.
B00T7S8ZWQ|4|Worked fine for a 05 honda rancher 350. Nothing bad about it that I could find
B000BQR100|4|Good sun shade.  Works as intended.  MUCH better than cardboard and easily folds up small.
B00H12XLYW|5|Love it, very easy to code my car now
B00CNGPWMA|5|cool cup!!!
B00C30727O|5|fits my Honda shadow ace deluxe 2002 perfect. very little issues, more dealing with the throttle cables than anything, grips were perfect addon to my bike. great quality, good service awesome new look
B00P808TIC|5|Excelent, thanks.
B00A13MNO2|5|Works great, installed on a Chevy G30 sport van.  Easy straightforward installation.
B00282P0IK|5|Perfect fit and fills solid
B00B9FEKF6|4|Shipped fast. Easy to follow directions included.  Works great.
B00BSRO72Q|1|I didn't know it was in black thought was white I didn't see where it says to send a message saying what color you want it in or it will come in black. Also I've put on rub on stickers before , this was a pain in the butt, the paper backing keeper coming of decal lf were lucky enough to get it to transfer over to the clear peace  I take the blame for in coming in black even though that option could have been more visible. Needs to work using a better transfer paper
B0036E9VB6|5|This is really nice, works great !
B0010ECUL2|4|Great replacement
B00I1BTCB8|5|Just perfect !
B00W6T7OWK|3|NOT a direct fit. I had to go to the manufacture's website and pay another $20 for an adapter. The stereo seems to be good quality, but has no scan function. The final product is nice but difficult to use.
B00MNNHWBC|5|Very strong and durable
B004SL0MZK|5|Work great
B00BE5J6L4|5|Very heavy duty, actually much beefier than I expected. It would be easier for a would-be thief to sawzall through the topper shell itself than to try to pry these open.
B0089KNGNQ|5|The item comes great and new.  Good uncut key and fob with battery.  It's programmable. Good stuff. Delivered on time.
B001GH5PWY|5|Bought this switch for my 22&#34; Racers Sport light bar. It looks grate in my Polaris ranger midsize. Fast shipping. I would recommend these switches.
B000C7QG68|5|Perfect fit for my Isuzu Trooper 94, works perfectly fine and the shipping was fast.. five stars, thank you!
B002OM8TQE|2|Not impressed. Smells like Grandma's bathroom, and doesn't last very long. Personal preference I suppose, has an old school aroma. Like something from a washroom in the 70's... definitely not a modern scent.
B001AEX4KI|1|Got caught in the rain with this on and it didn't stop a drop of rain. I spent the next 2 days taking out carpet and vacuuming out water with a shop vac to get my Jeep JKU cleaned up. This top went straight from the jeep to the trash. No wonder they included 2 poncho's with it. You will need both the cover and the poncho to stay dry.
B00E1SMK6Y|5|Exact same thing as OEM fit was perfect
B00WZWWTIM|5|Perfect! The YouTube video walks you through everything no surprises easy peasy!
B00WHW227I|4|Good value but not great, doesn't lie flat.
B008VQRLUM|5|Put on my 2006 Hyundai Elantra GLS to replace the plastic end links that i cut off. They work great and were a direct bolt on.
B00I9DZ9O2|4|Looks genuine and feels genuine as well!
B000636NCU|5|This thing is truly a must have! I have so many it's ridiculous. For my car, for my car's interior, for my electronics, for the television...There's nothing you can't use it on and it's ability to trap dust, dirt, and grime is impeccable. And it can be washed, even with bleach!<br /><br />Same quality and performance you always expect from 3M.
B000PL0CTI|5|These are no fuss spark plugs.  I had my mechanic install them into a 8 cylinder truck.  I'll grant that the old spark plugs were on their last legs, but holy cow does my truck start and sound great now.  I never knew spark plugs could have such an impact though logic dictates they would!
B00BAZBYTU|1|Didn't fit...
B00684THQA|5|super easy to program.  No problems, been using about 1 month.  2 minute setup.
B003NU0EM8|1|Suction cup ripped off after three pulls
B00IEYDSHQ|5|Great tire for the price. Arrived days earlier than promised.
B007VXD3HQ|1|Delivered may 4th, 3 led bulbs already burnt out and some flickering August 8th.
B000XEBI9K|5|Great product will save on people who bump bumpers wish you made one for the front bumper
B002IVAMWA|5|Made very well Great very happy.!<br />fast delivery
B00IS6Y3IS|2|Sizes are way off compared to standard  American sizes...good vest but I'd  suggest ordering  a few sizes above what you normally wear
B00BMU9DS2|5|They were great they match my van
B0001WTY0E|5|Explorer 2 SUV Tent. I just picked my tent up at the post office. 15 minutes later I had it installed on my 2001 Tahoe. Fits perfect. I was afraid the Tahoe would be too big, but I was wrong. I just followed the instructions. One drawback; the lift cannot be raised all the way open, but I knew that from reading other reviews. I would recommend this tent to anyone that needs this type of tent. TWO THUMBS WAY UP!
B000EQNTG2|5|Excellent performance !
B006H0UTKS|5|great love the drivers door entry saves a lot of time if you need something out of the car without taking the whole cover off.
B000EOZMV4|5|Good product works well, makes polishing a lot more fun.
B001ODRWFS|4|Relay was missing !! you loose one star, but the horn sounds great not too loud not too quiet, right amount of sound :)
B000XQM1IK|2|Used it to quieten up my 2011 Cadillac CTS-V which already had stainless works long tube 1 7/8th inch headers and 3inch straight pipes all the way to the back.  The welding inside did not create a smooth flow unlike other x pipes.  Didn't seem like typical magnaflow quality of design or material.  It ended up being a temporary fix until I got a Stainless Works header back exhaust system with integrated x pipe.... Big difference and less drone.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works perfectly!!
B00MIEQ9D8|5|works great
B00332GMVS|4|Fit well just a tad short on the ends, but overall I am satisfied.
B000DCNEZI|5|yes it did it was just like oem
B00G5OHOJA|5|My exhaust doesn't leak at all anymore
B00DI3DV6G|5|I like it, keeps my trunk organized!
B00H20HAHW|5|As expected
B00032K3TS|2|The part is nice but It does not fit a 2013 Ford Explorer. The SUV's license plate light holder body hits the top of the license plate frame and prevents the mounting holes from lining up.
B00LBB56GU|5|Nice quality sticks very good
B00SRL80TC|5|Can't beat the price!!
B0060A7ZQ6|4|OEM REPLACEMENT part.
B000WJX2YA|5|the original Yausa in my Snapper mower lasted almost exactly 5 years , which is excellent for these small batteries.I hope this one is that good. The local dealer wanted  $68.00 for the same battery. Its easy and safe to fill with acid if you follow the directions.
B00IKMKETC|5|Awesome replacement
B00NJ6QTOS|5|Ordered and got it the next day... Looks cool on my bobber
B00UF68W2M|5|Works awesome good quality
B00I3DI0NU|5|Excellent price and the bearing mount worked perfectly.
B000BOC3LY|5|This stuff worked really well at removing the problems on my slide out topper when other products would not begin to work. This stuff is the boss as far as I am concerned.
B008G32B1O|4|excellent! It included all accessories for installation
B003S82DEM|2|It's nice but the adhesive doesn't stay it falls everytime ;(
B004BT4CO6|5|Quick shipping and just as described.
B010JRJYFK|5|Goog
B00LEBLI82|5|Worked well.
B000CSWOP4|5|This thing is a must have.  I thought these were for old men but I find myself using it quite frequently.  I have now ordered the ice scraper and will use this during the winter months along with the brush to clear snow/ice.  This will be nice instead of having to haul around a separate ice scraper in the floor of my pickup.
B000JFJLP6|5|Buy this.  It dows just what it is advertised to do and in 6 mo's has saved me and acouple of other guys about 4 times with out fail.  Wouldn't it be nice if everything worked as well as this jumper.
B004A6OCPY|5|Order came in quickly, and part fit was correct.
B007XE5LTG|5|this is kool
B00V1OIL14|5|The hitch is easy to install and stylish as well.
B00LOZMGF2|5|Looks just like the picture. I love it.
B000KL1116|4|It's was perfect for my Honda Accord. It does what it said it will do....
B0057GWP6Y|3|Meant for large windows, not a standard car window. Probably fit better in a truck or maybe a van. I tried to put it in my car window and I can get it in there but it hangs off the sides and I have to shove it in there.
B001D9E41I|5|Great for keeping the sun out!
B004GA3JU8|1|Not very happy the  part discretion said it would fit a acura Integra ls. The part wasn't even close had to send it back so I'm giving it 1 stare
B00DNGXQN6|5|The quality is good and it fits well.  I can tell it's designed for subie with eyesight cameras even though mine doesn't have them.
B003OXIKDE|5|Good quality & priced well,
B001F02NCW|5|I love the eagle cover very much thank you.
B008JCW9GY|5|I love this winch, how it works and looks.  I bent the fairlead and need to replace.  I would like to know how to order the same one.
B004PLANUC|5|Good product.
B0041TOQTM|5|Ordered starter for 2007 Nissan Sentra and it arrived 2 days later.  Nissan dealership wanted $274 for starter, and local auto parts store wanted $139 with core trade in.  So, spending $74 for brand new starter without core trade in is simply outstanding.  Bolted new starter in and it works great.
B00DKDFVVC|1|Did exactly what the directions said.  Dissolved the entire contents in a bucket of hot water.  Put that and 15 gallons of water in my 51 gallon black water tank.  Drove for an hour on the worst road that I could find around here.  Not very hard to do since Northwest Washington has some real losers and the road that I picked would certainly have severely agitated the contents of that tank.  Let it sit for an additional 2 hours while I struggled with the hookup in this RV park.  Drained and rinsed the tank repeatedly.  Same old readings.  A week later and several flushes and readings and I still have 2/3 tank full.
B0051PKGU8|5|Worked well along with DA polish system.
B00BMRRZ94|3|wrench does not fit well into available area
B0031HCOI0|1|It worked for about 15 minutes before the regulator went out. Would not recommend this brand.
B00YI3IGA6|5|I wasn't sure how well these would work, but after using them I can say this is a great invention. It gets extremely hot here in Texas during the summer months and you want any kind of shade you can get. If you have a car with windows that are not tinted then this is a cheaper alternative. However, these shades will only fit on your rear windows. If you have a coupe (2-door car) these will not fit as the side mirror's will get in the way. My windows are tinted, but I used these recently when I had my seats shampooed and cleaned. I had to have my windows cracked so air could get in and the seats could dry. I was able to put these over my rear windows and roll the windows down half way, but I didn't have to worry about dirt blowing into my car. If you have small children these will work great at blocking the sun. They are easy to install with an elastic end that stretches over the window and holds it in place. Depending on the size of your window you may have a little excess material that hangs over the top, but you can hide that on the inside. It does make it harder to see out of those rear windows especially if your windows have a tint. I am very satisfied with ShadeSox and would definitely recommend them.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B001EA0LYA|5|looks good
B0093SQQZS|5|These fit my daughter's 2005 Toyota Celica GT perfectly!  Helpful videos on you tube for install.
B008B5X5GC|5|I bought this TPM sensor as a replacement for the failed one on my Chevy Malibu 2008 and have it installed by a dealer for $70. The sensor works grate, providing consistent and accurate readings. It is even more sensitive to the tire pressure changes then factory installed sensors I have on remaining 3 wheels. Product came in ACDelco branded OEM plastic bag with made in England markings on the sensor.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Don't roll down hill get these chocks
B0036GGFV8|5|Good quality.  Especially like the connectors being permanently fastened on the bag.  A little smaller than I thought even when expanded.  Overall looks and fits good on my FZ1.
B0035GWECS|5|Makes my Dodge MegaRam growl even deeper n kicks up horsepower
B0060HP3AY|5|works good, glad I had 4ft piece of pipe to use as a cheater on my breaker bar.
B007CTR582|5|Awesomely loud with no drone. This exhaust is the closest you can get to straight pipe exhaust as possible.
B00U7DVPE0|1|Didn't work at all. Fond a different kind.
B0002SQYUA|5|perfect
B0061TU2JS|5|Great LED visor lights, worked perfectly for '09 GMC Acadia. Would recommend.
B003F0DWJ8|3|its a prety clean and pure sent for the price.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Nicely fits a Volkswagen Golf Sportwagon!<br />Does a great job in our 80-100 degree weather.<br />Compactly folds!
B00J44GBAQ|5|yay! These totally fit our dust busters!
B001CEJH3Y|5|Installed in my 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe. Works and fits perfect, just like OEM.  FRAM quality that I depend on.  Will be back to purchase another when the time comes.
B0002SQSQK|5|MADE IT THE USA NOT CHINA.  NOT JUNK
B007Y86BHM|5|I put this on my vw and it worked great!
B0009IQZFM|1|Leaves streak marks all over. You're better off using your hand to dry.  If only there was a 0 star option
B00GHT5Y68|5|fit well and installed quickly thanks
B010COIZZK|5|Works perfectly for the cargo area lights in 09 GMC Acadia, would recommend.
B009RWPQCO|5|Came in the mail quickly. No functionality issues.
B004QEKGA0|5|I've actually enjoyed this item so far.  It made extra room in jeep for camping.<br />For those who don't know,  you do need to put it together.  May take a little bit of time.  I do recommend the separate cargo bag as well.  If we had not gotten it,  everyone would have been covered in dirt and mud where we went camping.  Even on the dirty street,  so a great extra to have!
B008ZDYLC2|5|The Actron code reader was an easy to use tool for diagnosing auto problems on my car. I had a code for check engine come on my dash. Upon doing some research I discovered many bad problems may exist from this signal. My worries were put aside after reading the engine code with the Actron code reader. It identified the code as a misfire on cylinder 3, a simple change of spark plugs should be all that is needed to correct the issue. I really like the fact that I can use this tool on multiple auto and is super easy to understand the directions in the provided manual and easy to use.
B00D2C1URK|3|Parts are great.  Took awhile  to get them in the same state.
B0001EXTYO|5|They shipped fast, went on very easily, came with 2 alcohol wipes to prep your lenses.<br /><br />Install takes about 2 minutes (if you're being super careful)<br /><br />Bottom line....I love em.
B004AIEQI0|1|This product is made of cheap materials and it failed less than 1 year after installed!  I don't mean it cracked or developed a small leak...no, it literally disintegrated at the level where the gas sat on the grommet!
B003VLBPJA|5|just what i wanted
B000BQW5LK|5|Yep.
B0089T01NU|4|Bought it for my 2003 Forester and it worked perfectly.  Comments from the other reviewer made my decision to purchase the device easy.
B00BAZC6JM|5|Worked
B00CB8WM2S|5|Car hammer feels like it was made very well. I hope I don't have to use it.
B00NLNI8IO|5|These bottles are a detailers wet dream. The dual action spraying capabilities makes thinhs alot easier. I use it with ecosmart waterless wash and it does a great job and decreases my work time by more then half.
B003CSL44S|5|The carpet underneath these mats is almost completely free of debris when I take them out during a thorough cleaning of my car. They catch just about everything & work especially well in winter keeping the salt & snow from the carpet underneath. Love these mats!
B00G2Q5IMG|1|Read directions, too much trouble to set up. It is still in the box.
B005TMIXL2|5|Fits perfect.. I didn't need the rear window ones as I have a club not crew cab but came as a set..
B00G4L23PY|4|I received the wrong bulbs (H7), but I am intending on reordering after I get back from vacation.
B0013G02C6|3|Was not a perfect fit for my 1988 k2500/ 350 tbi. I did manage to get it to work with some fabrication if I could go back I would try to find another bracket just to save myself a big head ache
B00T6U4URE|5|These things are bulletproof. Heavy duty, easy to install.
B00TNIBE00|5|Item was an exact match for the one that had failed...Install took only 5 minutes!
B0042KJ53W|5|It works very good .it does what i wanted
B000XQQ0G4|1|The muffler sounds great but has a rattle after installing it. I think magnaflow's quality control is mediocre at best.
B0019QW7GY|5|Perfect protection for my trolling motor
B00XO6BW40|4|Great tool when I needed it. I have read complaints on similar tools offered by other sellers but realized in what they described as cheap metal that distorts by expanding had more to do with not recognizing the limitations on sight and feel. If you have valve locks that have been seated well from high mileage and have sort of adhered to the retainer, you may want to loosen them first by placing something directly under and center of the valve head and something else on top of the retainer suitable for tapping with a rubber mallet to break the locks free. I used this tool on a Nissan 1.8L cylinder head with no real problem other than noting that the threads were a bit coarse and loose fitting which requires a little more labor effort.<br /><br />A head with stronger valve springs might make the coarse threads more pronounced. As for the possibility of the tool expanding, I imagine an avid do it yourselfer would likely also have a MIG welder on hand (I do) and could easily run a bead on the inside seam to reinforce it against that possibility.
B00J6ZI4JE|5|Easy to install and fit great, took about 1 hour to install, I have secondary bumper that uses the same holes that made it a bit more of a challenge.
B001Q4VILY|5|Works great on ATV. Using to drag logs out of the woods.
B00JEYH7A4|5|best goggles ive owned
B00DSR49FE|4|they're pretty thin but i does the trick
B008AYI8RA|5|Good service and product
B00A4G4NXA|5|Easy to install on my Honda VLX 600  just had to get longer bolts<br />Glad I got this backrest as my girlfriend and I just got hit from behind<br />Without it my girlfriend would have really gotten hurt worst than she did
B001EYHK5E|5|This is a great boat jack! Exactly what I needed for my trailer.
B00W9OJ4PM|4|works great easy to see and check tires.
B00LMHP89I|2|I installed the blind spot mirrors according to the instructions. I drove in driving rain storms, through construction zones and at altitudes of 400 feet to 11,000 feet. One week after installation with the temperature at 98 degrees one of the mirrors fell off.  A day later the other mirror fell off. The glue residue left on the car mirrors were the size of the mounting pads and filled the entire area.
B004UR34AM|5|Installed these on my 2002 Ford E-150 conversion van.  Ride with no load is a little stiff, but they worked flawlessly when towing a 6000 lb trailer.
B00GBONC68|5|Fantastic!  Gets rid of buffeting wind noise when windows are open.
B0095D34YM|5|Easy to replace.  Works great.
B001PWA0IO|4|Got this for my 2014 F-150 and it (now) works great. The expanding stud for the lower mounting position doesn't seem very secure (you results may vary) and sure enough, after about a month following installation, began to loosen. But...this fix is in! I removed the inner panel and with a box-end wrench attached to a longer 'handle', taped a nut in place and threaded the ball stud in from the outside. Perfect! Now, six months later it still works great, lowers the tailgate slowly and safely and doesn't impede closing at all. Would I buy again? Absolutely, but I'd just install the nut to begin with. Dee Zee should make this an option in the instructions, for a more secure fit.
B000KKOE4I|3|I was missing a knob on a 30-year-old stove.  This one doesn't match exactly, but it works.  Like some other reviewers, I had to stuff some filler into the insert so the knob would depress the switch enough to let it turn on and off.
B0002Q80GS|5|Super easy install & well made!
B0002L6WTA|4|This is an excellent sunshade. It is rigid enough to cover the whole windshield with only a small gap around the rear-view mirror (to be expected).<br /><br />There are two reasons I don't give it 5 stars:<br />1. The sunshade is hard to roll up. Not that it's hard to roll--it's easy to roll, it's just hard to roll and secure using the velcro strap. I roll mine up a bit like I'd roll up a sleeping bag, but the problem is that the velcro strap is oriented so you have to roll underhanded, not overhanded. This adds a bit of a challenge, but it can be done. If I designed these sunshades, I think I would reverse the velcro to allow for overhand rolling.<br />2. There is a horizontal crease across my sunshade on the right side that keeps it from fitting flush against the windshield. Maybe I'm being a bit picky, but I don't think it should crease that way.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great buy and well worth the money for the summer months. My shifter knob is several degrees cooler as a result. I recommend this sunshade.
B0046CZKIA|5|I bought this because I live in Alaska and we have very harsh winters. If you get stuck in the snow it could be life-threatening at 50 below zero. I drive a Volkswagen small SUV and most of the time it powers through the snow pretty well. But I have got stuck on a few rare occasions. I have three small children and I can't risk getting stuck in the winter time with them in the car. After receiving the portable tow truck in the mail I couldn't believe the size of these I thought they would be a lot smaller, they are the width of my tire and they're pretty long. I haven't had to use them yet but I know that it won't be long before it snows here. I'm going to keep them in the back of my vehicle and I'll feel safe having them just in case I need them for an emergency. I do not have chains on my tires and I feel like this is a really good alternative for having a safe vehicle in the wintertime. They are perfect for helping you gain traction instead of spinning your wheels in the snow their cleats are at an angle which I think helps the tire catch traction better and helps you get out of the ditch or wherever you're stuck. I'm really glad I bought these I hope I don't have to use them but if I do I feel safe knowing that I have them. I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I will update my review this winter after trying them out in the snow.
B003CKJDW6|5|arrived in perfect condition
B008VXSX7U|5|Awesome Strobe Controller. Apart from so many patterns to choose from, what I loved about it most is that it has a LED indicator that shows you the current pattern that is on. Which is really awesome for people who don't have direct visual of the exterior strobe lights. They can also handle a lot of amps. Surprisingly easy to install and it comes with clear and precise instructions for newbies.
B00HV0RXI4|4|The front seat covers are two separate parts. The part on the back of the seat just slides over the seat and that was easy to put on, but the part where you sit has to be attached with some little clips they give you and the way my car is designed it's hard to connect them. I drive a hyundai santa fe, the back seats were easy to put on. Other than the bottom part of the front seat cover it was easy to put on.
B000C7QFL4|5|Bought have not installed yet rebuilding my 1991 Chevrolet Blazer the one in it now leaks.
B002FV2K6Y|5|This is a great lock. Well made and worth the money. Not like those cheap ones
B0002KR88A|1|i do not understand this fuse holder.  the pins inside are out of alignment.  i doubt a fuse can actually go into it.  i suspect someone wasn't paying attention.
B000A6Z950|5|Lawn mower picked up a rock and busted my tail light. This did the trick at a good price. Easy install.
B000EVU8MK|5|Worked with out any problems. Used it to ground hop my Caddy 500 engine for cam break-in
B000TPZII0|5|worked...........
B00BITL5VK|5|Good price
B005ZKKHNU|5|This is perfect fit for my 98 Toyota corolla not too big or small. I just need to modified the brace. Nice sound.
B004I13MQG|5|Perfect
B00GK77LJ0|5|Excellent price & service. Look great on my car!
B002FVRU0A|4|As expected
B00MB3J2AI|5|works great and low cost. Fits my 250 dirt bike
B001MA1P6K|5|Like what I wanted for my Honda CBR650F ! It's perfect and blue!!!
B00SO8JWWM|5|Fox Racing tops fit are average. I'm averagly a medium and this top for me great.
B00HYHZM9Q|5|Fits great, another product to protect my new car from my three dogs. :-)
B004C3LPIM|4|Looks pretty good overall on 07 prius.  Install was no fun because of the design of the headlight.  It does help with a second person,  latex gloves and a heat gun with light swipes just to give it some pliability while installing it.  A second person helps minimize air bubbles underneath.
B000WEPI4M|3|Gift for friend.  Doesn't fit car due to seatbelt interference.  She uses it on her couch and is pleased.
B009XAWU60|5|Great product. Have had these in my last 5 vehicles.
B0012TRNTY|5|Great job!!
B00D8UFQFI|1|Doesn't stick . 2 days and it pealed off
B003TU662Y|5|Ok bought one and used it on a deck loved it bought 2 more  they are great
B007H2RR78|5|Hoses that came with the new camper developed pinholes after about three months.  This new hose appears to be very high quality  and much more rugged design than factory ones.
B0006PT01Y|1|No matter how I applied it, it left a horrible foggy film on the windows. Difficult to drive that way, had to clean it off
B008G2236S|5|Fit and look awesome
B00A3VUKR4|5|Original Equipment part.  Excellent.
B001V9P8S8|5|worked great
B001O7IU4G|5|Good description. I made this valve work in a very unique application.
B009YFQN4O|5|Great dial
B00566IKY6|5|Nice piece in original HKS packaging, perfect fit in V1 HKS SQV BOV. Haven't installed the valve on the car yet but I'm sure it will sound great!
B001O77CMW|4|Great motorcycle trunk!!  Installation instructions are very simple and it fit like a glove to the motorcycle for which we bought it - no problem.  Pretty secure, attractive design, holds plenty of riding paraphernalia including helmets, gloves, as well as groceries, etc. Electrical is a little challenging, but not because of the T-box itself - it's locating the wires on the motorcycle that is a challenge, but then again that's a challenge on all vehicular wiring.  Great piece of equipment!!!
B0041THL80|5|Easy to install and works like it should!
B0072LCY86|5|Works as advertised. Wire it up to your harness, set it to the correct HU brand, plug it in and enjoy your factory steering wheel controls on your aftermarket HU. No programming needed.
B005ZHRNOE|5|It fit perfectly in my Vw Gti 2011. I'm very happy with it.
B00SN2LN44|5|Good
B0090W09Q4|5|Perfect fit for a replacement faucet Took the old off easy replacement
B004VFVFC2|5|Best for my black corvette I got all my car loving friends using Adams glaze best
B001FXRO7S|5|I love it it's a great addition to my RV trailer which I have Wolf stuff all inside
B000E28C7M|5|Excellent just what I expected.
B000CM0WY0|5|Easy application and has stayed put through several car washes. Good buy.
B00XZ9PBXO|4|Its very good
B000C2MANG|5|worked very well now I got cold air again
B004OU620O|5|Covers the seats perfect!!!
B000FN8H52|5|This pen works great for small areas. Used it to clean up small chipped areas before touch up on my vehicle. Will purchase again.
B00JBNYYQ8|1|I will not recommend this product.I car wash my car so it will be clean when I put or used this product it doesn't help it did not remove the scratch on my car I try & try & try again it's not a big one just a small scratch but it then HELP AT ALL...Sorry but I'm just telling the truth😞
B002UC4Y6C|5|Excellent product MUCH cheaper than dealer!
B00TNMP4QG|5|Fits perfectly in my 2014 Pathfinder.  Shipping was fast.
B000YM6TX6|5|thought it was to thin but Not!  I like it!  works Great!!
B00KY4V4HU|2|Kinda cheap quality
B000276B1S|4|did fine
B0091XUAY8|5|It works great 4 how cheap it is. The thing I don't like is the Coil cord. I wish is have a straight cord.
B007JN5HSQ|4|smaller than the one on are other scooter but it works
B001NYLKDI|5|love the gated it the best in my opinion in the world of cars
B00FT65MAI|5|For very reasonable price excellent cover for indoors
B004MS9VTW|2|This is a tool made from softer metal, you are best off buying a heavy duty one for more than a use or 2. Largest pin mushroomed more than the chain did. It got through a DID 525 chain but barely. I went for a larger chain breaker and only used this for the press and rivoting head.
B00LC8WDTK|5|Very good
B00OF2UU8Q|5|Have not installed yet. Looks like it will do the job.
B000EBOOZC|3|Would like it if it would cover the whole wheel.
B008427CZ2|5|They work great for my 2006 Lancer.
B000BPSVV4|3|Looks and feels great but too big for my Mazda3
B00CO2LWYA|5|good fit, heavy duty material
B000J47NZW|5|fits perfectly!
B00JLKVHNY|4|Great quality mats made to fit the Benz GLK SUV. Bought this and was nothing short of a good quality product. The tough fiber feel as well as perfect fit into the feet floor space in the vehicle was especially endearing to me.
B00IAJ2MLS|5|Installed it myself and works great!!
B007QBKBM8|5|Excellent Rotor.
B00CPLC8ES|4|These Mirrors are a cheap knock off, they fit and require wiring modifications. Most annoying is they do not pivot on the base , rather they are rigid.<br />Not sure I would recommend. Price is only draw.
B00OXA2MDG|5|Perfect!!! Quick ship. Happy!
B00496VJ74|1|Worked great for my 2001 GMC 2500HD 6.0 until it stopped working in less than 1000 miles.  What a pain to replace all over again so soon.  I wouldn't buy this fuel pump again if my life depended on it.  I wish Amazon would offer me a refund, even partial refund would take away some of the sting.
B0084RGH3K|4|Workd just fine...
B00HFLCKAK|1|Listed in product catalogue as the replacement for<br />OEM 2014  1.6 Ford Escape air filter . It however is 1/8 &#34; too long ; making impossible to close the air<br />Filter housing . Can't be forced to fit . Will have to<br />Return or exchange for one made by ford .
B0036QZ8VQ|5|Used just rear arm, pretty solid, works good.
B008BC8EW0|5|Easy to install. Wish GM made this an option long ago!
B000BZZQY4|1|I didn't want to write a bad review but this rotor doesn't fit 95 BMW 318i even though it says it will fit my 95 BMW 318i on amazon. ROTORS ARE THICKER AND I THINK IT MIGHT FIT NEWER BMW SERIES; I AM NOT SURE THOUGH.
B007FR3JVI|1|Item not as pictured.  Very disappointed.
B0000AX5X5|4|I'm cheap and these keep the dust and rocks out of my eyes. Don't seem to fog up at all.
B001TIZ52A|2|not the quality and fit of front ones .
B002EVU68E|5|does the job
B002N5YEZM|1|These are really bad.  They are very rickety and loose.  There is a lot of &#34;play&#34; in the adjustable part, so no amount of securing them to the table will make it sturdy.  I had high hopes, so I mounted them on my table, but I have to return them.  Even at only half their possible length, they are really shaky.
B00KLEZDQG|1|When we opened the package, one of the items was badly scratched. Not the best quality.
B005JU5VH8|5|A++++
B00UE25GL2|1|Vary vary disappointed with this itam. Was send used and damaged . And was not able to send back . They never send me back a labe to return it and I annoy able to install , because does not fit my wrx .
B00GSAUHB8|5|My car is a lot cooler than what it usually is after being in the sun all day now that I have this shade to put on my windshield. It definitely does its purpose well!
B004O47XB2|5|worked well
B010GO1K5S|3|Very light weight, after only 2 days most bubbles are crushed, lacks sufficient attachment points to hold in place, unlike other similar products I have purchased in the past.
B00TG8C8PW|5|The frames have help up really well for the last 3 months i have had them and they do look good if you have a darker sedan and want it to blend in. I will be buying these again for what ever car I get. I like my cars in the dark gray metallic color. As an example of the color, look at your B pillars that are vinyl wrapped from the factor and how it is shiny but blends in. That is how the license plate look. Same color and reflection.<br /><br />So stop reading the reviews and just buy them already!
B007HRN4N4|5|Deserves the best rating even though its just a seal. Appears to be every bit as good as original. Just a little bit different, but not enough to affect performance. It was only an inch longer than what I needed and was easily trimmed to fit.<br />  This seal fits the vertical framing edge of the vent. There are questions here regarding fitment. The product pictures do not show a profile view, which is what you need to see the detail of this seal and if it will fit your vent. I have included a profile view. With that, you can see that the protruding rim out the top fits between the deep groove. The seal has an additional rib; This should be facing out, seating up with the new cover.<br />  I also put a small amount of silicone on the edge of opening, pushed the gasket onto it making sure it is seated all the way in the groove, trimmed excess at the end and wiped off excess silicone.<br /> NOTE! Replaced this seal while I was replacing Vent lid; CAMCO #40148. Nice cover.<br />Saved us time and money over taking it to the RV dealer. Good luck!!
B001D6HKZI|5|Great! Looks Great and I get a lot of compliments on it.
B00B93ZXGS|5|This is an outstanding product!
B00VNBDWPK|5|I purchased a single pair of these bulbs for my 2015 Nissan Altima. I'm in the process of switching every light to LED. All I can say is, &#34;Wow!&#34; I tried this pair out in the fog lamps, low beams, and high beams, and I've decided to purchase two more pairs so that all of my front lights have these bulbs. The difference in visibility is astonishing. It might be an expensive upgrade, but the added visibility and cleaner look makes it worth it for me.<br /><br />For the last few months, I've asked a few mechanics if there was any sort of LED headlight option out there and I was told &#34;No.&#34; I'll have to share this product with them.<br /><br />Outstanding bulbs!
B007RYRAXC|5|Awesome, great, love it
B004RCV0OM|5|saved us alot of time
B00YB5GAEA|1|Read the 1 star and 2 star ratings! The USB plug does pull out from the case and installing/ removing the plug is difficult. Just used a super glue to try to fuse it to the case. Seems to work, but, time will tell!
B000NJ6EZ8|4|good
B000HBNX88|5|Performance was great
B000C5M2AO|5|Used on my 1992 camry along with NGK spark plugs and it runs very smooth now. All wires were numbered and fitted perfect.
B000COMXCM|5|cool pouch for mcguard wheel lock keys
B00762LCK2|5|I get compliments on this sticker everywhere I go! I love it and can't imagine my Jeep without it! It was easy to put on and I have had it for 3 years with no signs of peeling or scratching away!
B00GR2W7MO|5|Fits most of the cars in our club to a T.
B007VRDMWS|5|Steel inner cable is thicker than other brands and works well with older vehicle that need the durability of a stronger cable.
B00ADECCAE|5|Love these. They look awesome on my 2001 PT Cruiser. Easy to put on.
B00861C6LQ|5|Not my favorite to install but man is it worth it sounds good and looks good too. I got up to some guy on the interstate and got on it and he almost broke his neck lol.  Great product and I can tell a huge difference in throttle response and a little in power. I definitely recommend
B00PWD5BKY|1|It feels cheap
B0079GQKDE|5|I was impressed with the quality of the tool, it is all steel and well designed. The handle is comfortable and the ratchet is smooth. All surfaces of the tool are smooth and well machined with no corners cut to be cheap, you get what you pay for. This is the first Lang tool I have bought and I will definitely not hesitate to buy their brand again, plus they are American made!
B00SX9VMPM|5|Worked perfectly and bolted right into place!! Would definitely recommend this product to anybody
B00BN470M8|5|When I first bought my Chevy Cobalt, I got a cool Chevy keychain...it just broke and I searched all over to find just the right replacement.  This Chevy Steering Wheel Key chain is just perfect.  It's well made and I recommend it to other Chevy lovers.
B000CET8XY|5|Very good!
B00VVFH0RE|5|perfect fit
B00A2GR9R4|5|Awesome
B001GN1GLM|5|What can you say about a hitch pin? It does the job, good quality product.
B00AKHCB32|5|i had the old one out and the new in less than a hour and it fired right up..thank you amazon for the great service
B00QZHQF88|5|This seat cushion was purchased for the passenger on our Goldwing, for a second time. The first cushion was removed from the bike at a rally, obviously because the person removing it also appreciated the value of the cushion. It is everything that we wanted and was as exactly as advertised.<br />Our only wish would to be it having a zippered cover to allow removal of the cover for cleaning. We certainly recommend it for a riders comfort!
B004809X9W|5|Perfect for occasional towing.
B002PX91OG|5|This stuff sealed my head gasket on a 98 civic. For how long and is it a permanent seal i dont know yet. Mixes with antifreeze or water so thats good too. No more overheating
B009IFICUS|4|Fits my car !...cheap and easy to install!
B005FMU21U|5|Perfect fit and OEM part not cheap knock offs.  Was purchased for annual tune up.  Thanks for the great price and super fast shipping
B000FQ7IKE|5|The mirror works as intended. I purchased the mounting kit and it seems to be holding just fine. This replaced the broken mirror in my 1987 Dodge Ramcharger and is about the same size as the OEM one.
B001AIZ5HY|4|Works as advertised, but a bit messy due to spray from rotating drill/pad. My headlights are beginning to cloud up again after about three months.
B00DW4YLLK|5|I don't have the leaking problems others are having. One suggestion would be to keep the nozzle separate and get a stand alone cap. Because the only leaking is when taking the nozzle out of the gas some gets caught in the little screw on cap at the very top of the nozzle.
B00OLZ1YF0|5|love this shirt
B007Y5SP7E|5|Protects my air gauge. Fits nice and tight. All Good!!
B004A95A3Y|5|Yep  , I love the novelty helmets. After wearing my brothers I had to get one. And have always had a good experience dealing with LOWBROW CUSTOMS /Amazon .have bought quite a few things  in the past and your sure to hear from me again ! Eric Price
B0035X3Q6O|5|Fit perfectly and definitely a good deal!!!
B00MX6SJJS|1|Not the right's
B00BI2APMW|4|Very handy device to have.
B00QMVKIEO|5|Was very easy to do and looks great after doing my front and rear emblems
B000C2W91E|5|Perfect fit, go gates or go home if you're going to do a water pump
B001LHVOVK|1|The item I ordered and received will not work on my 1999 Honda Odyssee, so it was a waste of time<br />and money.  In the review of this item it seemed that it was the proper item for the need I had. So much<br />for buying from the Internet.
B00JMCCBRW|5|Great deal and got here quickly!
B001LHVOVK|5|Simple to use and works great!
B000C46GFC|4|Works great as a Mercruiser replacement at a 1/3 the cost. Decent quality for a reman
B00U9R3HUE|5|Cascadia 4x4 kept it simple, & &#34;The Flipster&#34; works flawlessly thanks to their incorporating the Reell Precision Manufacturing MH-14 friction hinge. It looks great on my '05 SD's blacked out front bumper & front end - I'm really looking forward to many years of trouble-free service from &#34;The Flipster ... The Flipster works perfectly with my Superwinch Talon 12.5 winch's roller fairlead ... Worth every penny, & truly worth the wait - two thumbs up Cascadia 4x4 !!!
B001PNC5CW|5|Perfect - made the job so much easier!
B00PT18QAQ|5|Excellent. Can read without glasses. Sturdy.
B001SGFCNA|5|Fits the driver side of the 2007 C230 Sport perfectly and quality is good. No more sound coming from that corner and ride quality is back to factory.
B009FNVMVY|5|Just like the original. great quality
B004IQHZ46|5|great tool. bought gate at home depot, the length was off so cut gate and used this tool to re assemble, wife was thrilled. I know its pricey, but this is one off those tools if you buy, you will find things and ways to use it
B003BSB7PU|4|The quick dissolving tablets are easy to use and they work. There is a pleasant lemon odor as they dissolve. They are a little pricey but I have not detected any gray water odor since I started using them several months ago.
B0007Y69AO|5|Great book for our tractor. Super helpful.
B000GD5FMY|5|The sunglasses do a good job of keeping the wind out of my eyes and they are comfortable too. They feel pretty solid and well made. I have bought other glasses that felt like they would break (and did) and these do not feel like that. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for a solid pair of glasses.
B002J8UPO2|5|I ordered this sticker and it came in 5 days. Seems to be good quality and looks cute on my car. Its not TOO big nor TOO small , which is great for the place I wanted to put it !!!
B00KMYYQ5O|5|extends the life of sunbrella and restores water resistance
B00DSLRHY0|4|Great springs to replace stock springs. Put on my 2006 Hyundai Elantra GLS in November 2014.
B00XUY97R0|5|Perfect fit
B00UKIWFSM|5|Great item...fast shipping...thanks!
B00SW775PG|5|Awesome customer care. Great product.
B0002Z9O7I|5|Work great. The velcro held the bike tires stable and also used them to cinch the bike to the rack.
B000Q03I6M|5|Nice quality
B00XD6QHJ6|3|Good, but find a way to mount it upside down so you can open it without spilling the guts out.
B011EQLLEC|5|The remote arrived very fast and took only seconds to set up!  This will be my first stop next time I need one!
B002ZAQPTI|5|Great helmet to wear while riding my Polaris Slingshot SL
B000EDUUG2|4|great little RV broom.
B009R563C8|5|Exact fit for my Vibe. Easy installation.
B0037UAP1E|5|GREAT bumper protection. Easy to install and easy to take off when if necessary. In a few instances I've part in tight areas where a vehicle was parked too close to me from behind. Luckily this bumper guard has allowed me to back out of a parking space with no damage. Its literally like a soft cushion for your vehicle. Also stays on VERY well when driving on highways, short trips and bumpy roads. Looks good on my vehicle.<br /><br />Minor gripe: Wish it was alittle darker in color, otherwise. 5 stars.
B000E2CVIS|5|K&n is the best
B00L844O1S|5|Excellent
B008XKQ2VA|5|Looks like it will work out fine.
B00KXMEL3M|5|Get this pack. I have been looking around for about a month. I make do fairly well and don't mind paying good money for quality, buuuuuut after checking some of the prices on &#34;motorcycle backpacks&#34; I have to ask WHY. I understand that the mark-up on motorcycle gear is up to 3X to 5X the cost of the product. So I looked around and don't get me wrong some of those higher priced packs look great, futuristic, and have the &#34;wow&#34; factor. Being a veteran I know the military issues/develops practical gear. I went on Amazon  and checked the reviews. I pulled  the trigger on this pack and I am not disappointed. My 17' laptop fits perfectly in the bag. I can have my laptop, lunch, pair of vans, and casual dress shirt easily. Also their are straps to secure this bag across the chest and waist. I place my work keys and cell phone in the pocket where you see the flag. A big plus are the straps on the side and the one you see on top. You fill the bag as want then you use these straps to tighten the whole bag so nothing is moving around as you ride. Get this bag  Get this bag  Get this bag  oh and Get this bag
B00F3J2FW4|5|Beautiful brand new slush mats. Correct fit for the 2015 4 door and black in color. Very pleased. Fast delivery.
B00663XKI4|5|Looks great.<br />Seems to be very well design.<br /><br />Feels really nice on my hands and with full feel of touch.<br />Also it is very breathable, so my hands do not feel hot.<br /><br />Good for use with any driving, karting or simulator racing.<br />Definitely could be use as regular everyday driving gloves as well if you dont mind the bright color.
B0097BC6UU|1|mine cracked and it keeps stopping my windows from going up
B0024NSQR0|5|These fit my 98 Nissan Altima GXE perfectly. It can be a bit difficult to get to the nuts on the bolts in back but even if you have to buy a ratchet and extension to get them it's still a whole lot less than getting a headlight replaced at a shop. Dealer usually wants around $250-300 for one, when you can do both and the corner lights for under $100 yourself in less than half an hour. The only tools you need are a screwdriver and a 10mm socket with ratchet handle (really helps if you have a swivel adapter for the ratchet to get behind one of the radiator hoses on passenger side). FYI -You have to pop the corner lights off to get to your headlight assembly so it's a good idea to change them while you are taking everything apart.
B000C1QOGQ|5|Had it installed on my 88 camaro with a sbc. Dropped the emissions significantly.
B00XV508FS|5|This jacket is sturdy and well made. It's great for cool weather and certainly feels safe, but it's unbearable in summer even without the lining. Definitely worth the price and then some.
B00XR46ADW|4|Good for the price..
B000FQ78VI|5|It was cool I just could use it with my set up.
B003BYHY6U|3|This is a nice console, but for the price I expected the cup holders would at least be somewhat usable. They're awful at holding pretty much everything. Your standard paper fast-food cup will pitch forward upon braking, causing the contents to spill everywhere. As for the USB ports, they don't provide enough power to charge an iPhone. Solution: Use the 120V outlet and a standard wall charger. I like the height of the console, as well as the nice deep storage pocket and hinged door. TSI, FIX THE CUP HOLDERS AND YOU'LL HAVE A WINNER!!!
B005OL1NBK|5|Easy install and good fit.
B003CK0P8C|5|I installed these without any problems and my forks look like new.
B004PXAUGC|5|work great
B001P2D50O|1|Missing parts!!!
B005S09XUA|5|Fit my 2011 Honda Pilot perfectly. Easy to install! Love this item
B001THMUOW|5|it works just fine for whet i need it for its a little on the cheap side but will serve me well
B001TIX392|5|great fit good quality
B00JIGA390|5|Installed in dash on golf cart work great
B00CCIM1YQ|4|I use it to lock my bike at public places. Does its job. Looks solid. Nice and bright. Best is that they provide 4 sets of spare keys. Knocking off 1 star as I think they should clarify on the size. Its too big to lock a bike. hard to carry around on a bike. But keeps the bike safe though.
B00651CLCS|1|No AM/FM signal.
B00KWHSVHK|2|Nice design but poor quality.
B00LU0RFMU|5|great
B00KTIZS3M|5|Love it
B001E9UWAE|5|looks nice
B00NVBW5EY|5|Easy to install and does exactly what is says it will do: catch almost anything dropped between the car seats. This is perfect item: inexpesive, safe, and easy to use.<br />Thanks for coming up with this peach of an idea!
B000E9C21M|5|Love these covers and so does my wife... so I will be ordering another pair.
B00T7DOA6Q|5|Great product and fast shipping
B009OFDJWI|5|looks very nice
B00N9VV47K|5|Great product.
B00UZ0OHIQ|1|GPS function depends on you using your mobile phone which completely defeats the purpose of connecting a separate device (Automatic Car Adapter) to the vehicle.  Very unclear and poor description on the packaging and website.
B00AOCN70O|1|Highly do not recommend at all to big do not fit not for a motorcycle at all very very disappointed.
B00S75A5IW|5|Lights worked very well!! Would absolutely recommend
B001OBO7IA|2|The bag itself is well made and has awesome storage space. Yet, it does not fit well on a Burgman 650. It has only one strap to secure the bag, which is fastened by running the strap under the seat. However, that is all there is to secure it. It flops around and gets in the way, when anything of weight is in the bag. It is distracting, awkward, annoying, and a waste of the money. Only good thing, it maybe a good carry on bag for personal items when flying.
B00GP32KEU|5|I call it the night sun. Insanely bright.  Very concentrated beam,  less of a flood more of a spot light.  Awesome mounted on bumper.  Definitely good for the trails at night. This thing is quality.
B00CJ5DZE2|5|works great
B004PAEELC|5|Perfect fit on the 99 Beetle 2.0.  I wish it came with a sensor cover, but took the one off the OEM pan and it sealed right up.  Great product for the price. Took 3 days to ship to Alaska.
B00167VG90|5|Good.
B000BQSIWK|5|Have been using it to trickle charge my (very expensive) Jetski batteries so they last longer.  I bought it because it has an AGM setting, which is a must if you are charging gel batteries.
B00PU3K8DQ|5|Lights themselves are great. Fairly easy to install on my 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited (JK). You will however need to replace the two retaining tabs on the splash guard and cut the wires to splice in the supplied pigtail connectors. Not a big deal, just a pain in the ass to have to deal with buying the retaining tabs.
B007C2XIGM|5|Fit perfectly, Problem solved.
B001C9MRH2|4|Works as advertised for the past 3 months.  Only complaint is that I wish it had come with a protective boot like the Rancho series.
B001TQMZWU|1|This chair broke where the arms attach to the back. I was sitting in it and it snapped and I fell. This chair should not be sold, it is dangerous !
B00CFH9L88|5|Fits my S&W Shield with laser in front of the trigger guard.  Seems like a solid build.  Mostly looking looking to deter little hands if they ever got them out of the locked storage.
B00EF3YOZ0|4|The bug deflector works like it is supposed to. I would have given it 5 stars except for the way it attached to the hood. We just added a couple of extra screws and all was good.
B00DFUORBK|5|Great deal, FIT G R E AT!
B004GCZ4FY|5|good quality
B00004YK76|5|This oil can is just the size and length delivery system I was looking for.
B002Q1IPXU|5|Very good quality product, easy to install. Looks great!
B000C75GIM|5|Perfect.  Fits fine and works well
B007I6R9M6|5|A genuine replacement filter that arrived timely.
B000CPJLIK|5|Great Engine Paint.  Moving forward I will only  use VHT.
B007WZS41I|5|Works nicely as replacement for 2014 T&C.
B001RUFBK6|5|Took only two days to arrive, free shipping, pretty easy to install. The only thing with mine is the right headlamp is really off so I will have to adjust it which shouldn't be a big deal.
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Really handy tool. I have 2 one stays with the bike one in the tool box.  Simple, handy, well made by Battery Tender.   Win, Win, Win.
B001DKT0DO|2|This thing is seriously distracting while looking into your side mirror and it obstructs my view. It feels like I'm looking into a circus mirror. Since it takes up space and confuses me, i don't know what the heck is going by the side of my car and makes it scary to change lanes. I've also gotten some comments describing them as geriatric.
B000C04GZI|5|This part worked correctly in my Lexus SC300 5 speed.  The bolts under the dash which hold this thing in are a bit of a pain, but it's doable.  The picture in this add (as of July, 2015) is incorrect but the part that arrived was correct.  Note this part does come with the little black float bobber thing that sits in the fluid just like factory.
B00EE8K4XM|5|Fit like a glove and completely protects the vehicle carpeting.  I think that Husky makes the best all weather floor liners and there is no other company that is close to the fit of the Husky product....buy them, you will not regret it.
B00E3BQRBI|5|Awesome.
B005J6JRMM|5|Extenders not only make the hidden buckles easier to reach, but they satisfy the annoying buzzers.
B005CDNCQO|5|Been using for a few months. Engine light did not come back on at all.
B002K5Q6GK|5|Loved it
B009FKWTO6|5|Great part all I needed after an install of belt broke the Clutch assembly at dealer.<br /><br />Fast, working and I am happy happy happy!
B00FQ0ROZS|2|There was only 2 lights in the box
B00ORLLJQC|4|easy to work on
B000I04Z7Q|5|Awesome, great, love it
B00EG8WBLI|5|All rags were square and the dimensions advertised with no frayed edges. The cloths is as thick as any laundry service shop rag I've used and am very happy with my purchase. One thing to remember, these are not &#34;nice rags&#34; they are for oil, grease and filth. I washed mine with hot water a few times when I first got them to get the extra red dye and lint out, the water will come out dark red the first few times. After the first Washings they are fine and leave no dye or residue behind.
B00R8QGITG|5|good
B00J73D6C0|5|This controller rocks!  Easy install and adjustments. I can really feel a difference driving the mountain roads while pulling a 17 ft pop up with a Nissan Frontier.
B00BITKUUM|5|Perfect.  This took about five minutes to install and test.  Here is a link that shows how. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax43SwfvnRU Test before removing old switch from armrest because the plastic that locks the switch in place is very, very thin.  Be careful when removing old switch.  The use of toothpicks to help unlock the switch shown in the you tube video really works best.  Only question now is how long it will last.
B002N5L9N2|3|Have not used it yet, but seems well made.
B00QGT1VIY|5|Great item. Just what I was looking for.
B0022ZN6WU|5|Excellent product. Fit my bike( 900 kawasaki classic) better than  any cover I've had  before. And it's water proof. Someone complained that the red logo on the cover was ugly, well I find the logo helpful in finding the front of the cover. Makes it easier to put on.
B004WLL0ZW|5|Gotta love the plug and play setup
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Freshens up the car interior.<br /><br />This bulb makes the interior look much better because the light is bright white instead of the dim yellow many cars have.<br />Added benefit: It's cool to the touch.  My tail lights have such a small space that factory bulbs eventually distort the plastic housing from heat. I've put these in my tail lamps.  They have the added benefit of being brighter as well.
B00RD7QP52|5|Fast shipping.  Part works great.  Very easy install.
B00NOLEM7E|2|It looked great... Before it faded. I'd say I got two, maybe two and a half months of use before the red faded to a dull pink and the yellow started to whiten. Maybe mine was just defect but it was kinda annoying.
B0026M5ROE|4|Just like the Dorman clutch master cylinder I bought, this slave cylinder is squeaky, even with lube at the end.<br />But besides that it works as attended, was bought to replace a factory one which was leaking around the dust boot.
B00AMLQ6HS|5|Best price I could fine. Fit my new Ram truck perfectly. Easy to install. With a friends help had them installed in a little more then an hour. This is the third Westin step bar I bought. Beautiful chrome, very rugged, very well made.
B0035AMPFK|4|This seems to be a quality product for this cheap price .
B00N6D7K38|5|Easy install and they match the color of the LED headlights on my F150.
B00PYENX1U|3|Arrived without cap and some sprayed in the box.  Looks silver to me.  We'll see this weekend when I use it.
B000H8U1RM|4|Good deal!!!
B00WO1Z80A|5|Bags were higher quality than I expected they have been painted and mounted -very pleased!
B00HCROOR4|5|Something so simple to do, screw driver to open clip on lift.  Five minutes and must prop up hood while replacing lifts.  Works great!
B004VR08IW|5|nice easy to install look great on my truck
B00NWFB2LQ|4|Nice quality, easy to program with instructions off youtube. Arrived on time
B010LT074S|5|Good bright light for the money
B003KXGU4E|5|Love it. Wish I could have found one with an AR or Tavor though.
B00E0OSDPQ|5|Finally, a good solid can that holds gas.  Sounds simple but if you've ordered some of the other jerry cans you'll know what I mean.
B0024ECDL4|5|more money way more quality
B000C9P0OK|5|Great product. Highly recommended
B001UFRUWU|5|Fantastic product. It does exactly what is needed to add load capacity to the vehicle. The van would scrape on driveways even without a load before I installed the helpers. The auto manufacturer should have included these as options. Installation  was super simple.
B004MDEV38|4|super easy to mount on my 2009 odyssey touring I did not have to remove muffler or anything just pushed it over so that my socket extension can reach. the hardest part was cleaning the holes with the threads
B00EQ4ZUYW|3|OK.  will get the job done.  their design changes all the time.  this is less robust that their previous design but they dig get a pair of 5 inch jaws on it.  Good for the price but not for shop or production use. great for DIYer or barn
B00A14QKSG|5|Right part for the job.  Replaced this switch and dash board controls gauges at the same time. Easiest fix ever.  Shipping was fast
B001B5GA0C|4|Got it next on time but no sticker. Pretty bummed that I got no sticker because in was reading the reviews and someone answered back to a question asking if it came with stickers. I mean come on. Even Tein shocks comes with stickers.
B000TYQB14|5|Worked great on my Yukon.  saved approx 100.00 over dealer price. Thanks dorman
B00S499ZIW|4|arrived in good condition, didn't know they were plastic but I didn't check the originals to see if they were also, fit well - looks good
B007ZGA1LK|5|Fantastic. Thanks.
B006I0F3DU|5|This is a great product,  nice fit. And very comfortable
B001D6Q18A|2|very thin and did not fit (mold not right?)  Had to modify it to fit.
B000EDUUIA|5|Great idea.  No wiring to garage door.  No climbing to garage ceiling.  Just drive the car into your garage and stop where you want to stop the car every time. Get out, place the unit on the floor and mark the floor.  Back car out and use the 3M tape to tape it down.  Works great.  Now I know when I hit this unit, by big SUV rear will be clear of the garage door as it comes down.  Little room to spare, so I needed a simple solution.  This was it.  Recommend over installing lasers or stop signs, or tennis balls.
B000C497NU|4|Cardone is always a good product.
B001LL9UQ2|5|I feel a little more secure
B00HUM6BIG|2|I am disappointed. I'm wondering if they are not made for hot areas. It is separating and has been since the first time I used it. I give it two stars because it actually fits my window.
B004LL9MPI|5|Not sure about the horsepower or torque increase but my gas mileage went up tremendously and will end up paying for itself.
B00UC85N5C|5|Perfect fit received in timely matter A+
B0089XR9M2|4|A good product for the price but it doesn't cover the full width of the trunk opening so there still a risk for scratching 1/3 of the bumper
B00QLZXOQ0|5|Thank you, for the quick delivery to Amazon or Kohree, they light has been installed yesterday, I tell you this thing is pretty powerful, we will have a rain on Thursday and wait to check if this hold the thunder :) I love it I used 2 of them on the vowel windshield, it's a killer. One thing , if you use a short TRD Antenna next to it, the light kill the frequency when you turn them on your radio stops working, but this is due to the antenna not the lights. you have to keep the original Antenna or not install the light next to it.  Flaws:ok finally it did not hold the rain so here is the picture of the light got water in it 22 days ago with rain and still is wet.
B00RIUP8VQ|5|Fits as expected and was delivered on time
B00L5QRG4Q|5|I love my dice
B00DNISBMU|3|I don't know
B007K20ADI|5|Prefect fit!!
B0006IX878|5|Great product. Used for daring MOTORHOME water tank not having to get my long hose out of bay. Great for hookup not crimping hose for city water. Use at bib keeping flexibility at the outlet. A must have at least 4.
B000CO9P96|2|Their a little weak, not much better than the worn shocks I replaced.
B00YILXTP0|5|Loved them
B00KJ8L6BK|5|So good so far...
B003BZD08U|5|Doing its job!! Thanks!
B00FYL3MUA|5|Perfect, it worked like a charm and it's quick to install.
B00IMO60H8|5|Great Product! Very satisfied.
B000C5G8CM|5|What can you say bad about a plastic screw cap?
B00FXLJ8U4|5|Everyone who owns a car should have this.
B0066SKOPG|5|Fits perfectly
B00LHUI4XM|5|Frame took moments to install and looks great.  Nice and sturdy, not at all flimsy
B00IZNZOYQ|5|great
B00P2RYKYS|5|Nice piece of the replacement part.  Works great so far.
B008CFVV0I|5|Good
B00032KC3K|5|Finishes off the Cruiser Covers.
B006NGJ8T4|4|Not as powerful as the original Toyota pump but for the price you can't ask for more. Still it does the job
B00UY8LUW0|5|great
B0012TYTH8|5|Just as advertised. Good product
B005A8ZBW4|4|Works great! Used it all the way to Sturgis and back.
B008VVTCKY|5|Delivery was faster than I expected.  I think it was two days.  I installed this in my Central A/C condenser (the outdoor) unit a few weeks ago and the AC has been working fine ever since.  I hope the capacitor will last at least 2 years; perhaps 10 years or more.<br />Background: My electricity supply from the power company stayed on but dropped too low for a number of days. (They said the neutral wire had disconnected from their transformer.)  The utility co. fixed that issue but my AC condenser would not work afterwards.  I took the cover off and found that although the fan wasn't turning, the motor was burning hot.  My 10-year-old capacitor felt a little oily on the outside and I guessed that trying too run the A/C's compressor and fan with the power too low had overheated the capacitor.  I replaced the original capacitor with this one, and (as I mentioned) that fixed the problem.
B00CPSXPUW|5|Adorable!
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Good stuff  affordable price.
B000BQR100|5|Excellent product. Yes, it does take a little practice to fold, but once you figure out the twist, is works very nicely and keeps the car substantially cooler in the summer heat.
B003V57NUQ|5|Awesome
B000H6MMYE|5|This matched the two toned seats in my 2003 Cadillac CTS. I did the whole bottom of the rear seat, except the black inserts and the side bolster on the drivers back and bottom of the seat.  It might be a tad lighter, but you have to point it out for someone to notice.  Been on there for a month.  Make sure to use SEM 39362 soap first.  I used a paper towel with the sem soap to clean the seat. Then used a gray skotch brite pad with the SEM soap to give the paint something to stick to. Then follow up with SEM 3853 plastic prep. Then I sprayed in around 4-5 light coats.
B00B2HHDH8|5|Just barely fits my 1998 Ford Taurus SE's side markers.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Hard to go wrong for $10. Haven't had it long enough to comment on longevity, but I only use it maybe twice a week and it's cute.<br />Pro tip: fold down your mirrors to keep it in place.<br />(I saw some comments saying it needed suction cups. Cups not needed. Unless you don't have mirrors.)
B003CXBVQE|5|Perfect fit for my 2010 Boxster. Fabric is robust and should protect against accidental door dings. Just fits into the front trunk.
B008UIS330|5|For my Mazdaspeed3. An amazing difference. A must when even slightly upgrading your mazda
B001H1JJB2|1|This spout is terrible!<br />The black cap cracks easily.<br />The thin rubber seal that is supposed to seal the spout tight tears easily so it leaks without it.<br />The spout itself will take you 20 minutes to pour 5 gallons of gas from the container - veeeerrrry sloooooow!!!<br />I bought myself a funnel, and pour gas from the gas can without using this spout.  I just need to find good seal caps without spouts to seal the cans for transport now and throw these PoSs away!
B003RW29FW|5|Arrived quickly. Works amazingly well. Had a hole in the aluminum roof of our travel trailer. Fixed the hole. Many rainstorms later, it holds great!
B000F72RKY|3|Got the socket adapter fast, it looks like it will do the job.  Made in China.  Will add to review after I use it.
B005M16QY6|5|Due to diabetics,  lower legs tend to heal slower. Excellent insurance for protection of your legs. Look at crash videos and see impact to knees and legs.  You'll want this.
B00JOY6U7U|5|Very useful.
B000BLMJN4|5|It is just a light bulb ... nothing to get too excited about.  The price was excellent and the speed with which I received my bulb, top notch!
B00L6J0B12|1|Good fit, easy install, shiney.  2/8/16 Update: Had these hubcaps on my G6 for approximately 6 mo and they are pitted and lost their shine! Very disappointed.
B00BWUZOWG|5|VERY GOOD
B0002VAZ34|5|Proof is in the pudding...this stuff rocks!!!
B00YW74ZW6|5|works great.  Make sure all your numbers match up.
B005493J1E|5|Very thin consistency so be sure to use a foam applicator or something similar to avoid drips & wastage. Really soaks in fast so doesn't cover as much area as one would expect so have extra on hand for project as will probably run out.
B000KITSMI|5|This little tool will get the job done if you have the regular style valve cores.  Every single time I've had a refrigerant leak in one of my cars it's been the service port valves and this tool will allow you to swap the valves out for very minimal cost and no loss of refrigerant.
B003YMTJBC|4|Nothing fancy here. Rotors are working as intended.
B004XONTXE|5|I installed this oil filter rel I cation kit on my 2005 Hummer H2, it cam with everything you will need, plenty of 1/2 inch hose was provided, 10 foot in fact..<br /><br />Well worth the money, now i don't have to crawl under the H2, do change the filter, also bought a Mity-Vac, so now the whole process I s done from above..<br /><br />I plan on buying one for my wifes 2004 Dodge Durango
B00S6NYVVM|5|Very good and on time delivery thank you
B000LR21FY|4|Cover is a pita to remove but otherwise good, theres really not much to it.
B00FSAV5LU|5|my favourite waterless wash system. It is very easy to use and leaves behind a great shine and water beading from the carnauba in this is actually VERY nice
B001TJ552E|5|worked well
B000S2UFXC|5|Much cheaper than in stores, perfect fit for 2009 Chevy Traverse
B004J378CW|5|Perfect fit for my 2002 Lexus sc430. Works well and holding pressure fine. At only about $100 shipped, couldn't be happier!! Direct fit made installation a breeze!
B000GTXNI6|5|This thing works great.  Beats grinding chain in two
B000CN4XPI|5|I will find a good use for this but haven't yet. Great quality and fast shipping
B00D42AFS8|1|Didn't work to jump a battery after initial charge. Would charge an I-phone though. Returned it.
B00K1PGX4Q|5|Easy install but you need the shock extenders!!!
B005MVB2WM|5|Excellent wrench holder at a great price
B00UO4G6GE|5|I don't think you could possibly buy better tie rods than these.high quality.I highly recommend these tie rods.the only thing that could possibly do to make them better would be powder coat the ends.these tie rods are what Chevrolet should have installed on their trucks to begin with.I don't think you could break these, you would break something else on your truck before these tie rods.
B006UH5V2Y|5|Bought used boat, motor and trailer (with surge brakes) and the master cylinder had given it up some time ago. Brakes wouldn't release and rotors were overheating badly. Ordered the replacement  you're looking at and--viola!--end of problem! Old one had a cast-iron body, this one's aluminum and just works perfectly! Was actually amazed at how cheap it was and what a difference it made. When you order, go ahead and spend the few dollars more and get the new shock absorber (#32306) as well; this will help the 'surging' problem on wavy roads, plus, you'll know you've rebuilt 100% of your braking system, assuming your wheel calipers are in good order. By the way--if BOTH calipers are overheating, it's your master cylinder. If only one is overheating, pull the caliper and check it out; chances are the MC is OK. Good luck!
B00IAB8L5C|5|Great product and fast shipping
B001AGNI2K|5|Perfect match for 2005 Toyota 4runner v6 Sport.  Unit is slimmer is size than original.
B00WB03LQM|1|cheap
B004IZWMD6|4|I took my Veloster, which is still under the manufacturers bumper to bumper warranty, for scheduled maintenance at the dealer. They wanted $80 to replace this. No way. I bought this on amazon and replaced it myself in under 3 minutes.
B00YDORJXK|4|I am not a big fan of tools, probably because my husband has them everywhere. That said, there are just some tools you need to have on hand, and for us, this set is one of them. These were exactly what we needed for our weed eater and mower.<br /><br />The set includes 4 different tools, each with a different tip to fit the different parts. You can see from the tip which one is which, but they are printed right on the side for one second identification. This is also helpful for new mechanics or assistants, so you know you have the right tool for your part. The set I received only had 3 different tools in it though. It came with two of the Single D tools instead of the Splined tool. This was ok for our needs, as we haven't had a use for that specific tool so far, but it's a little disappointing still to not get a complete set of 4 different ones like expected.<br /><br />The tools seem sturdy enough and have worked without issue. The plastic handles are small enough to fit comfortably, even in my small hands, and the metal ends offer enough strength to get the job done without stripping edges or snapping the handles off. These came individually sealed in plastic bags, allowing them to stay clean and separated until needed too.<br /><br />*I received a sample set of these in exchange for my honest thoughts.
B003E1O9ZE|5|I use this hose for my water while homebrewing, it does not impart any off flavors.
B00NV6H7I8|5|No issues
B0040B62N4|5|Christmas present for my son ( a Camaro owner)/ Was very pleased with the product
B00HNA9ZYM|5|Works great.  Used to scan multiple vehicles and hasn't failed me yet.
B0090UN116|5|Awesome, great, love it
B00JA1CBIO|5|It's amazing how inexpensive these things really are... performance from the Lower midrange all the way to the Rev limiter is Very noticeably Better than with the Stock exhaust.
B004ZL9CFO|2|This was bought for my daughter's Trailblazer.  It was a terrible fit.  The height was good but, the bottom was no where near snug enough.  The first turn she made, this flipped out of the car's cup holder and the drink spilled on her.  Luckily she didn't have an accident.
B00027GVCM|4|Ordered a coil from the dealer also. I installed the one from the dealer thinking it should be better but not impressed with that for the extra money. I have not installed this yet but saved for a spare and will order again if needed. Appears as good or better than dealer supplied and $20 cheaper.Also didn't have to wait as long as dealer part to get when they couldn't tell me when coming in
B007V2BGC6|4|For a 09 G37x sedan there is about a 1/2&#34; gab on both sides of the shade and the window. Also it tends to not sit against the windshield so it does help block the heat but to as much as the ones that sit a lot closer to the windows. As an example at the top where the sun visors hold there is about a 1/2&#34; to 1 inch gab between the windshield and the visor.<br /><br />The build quality is great and the front does get very warm to the touch, hence why this is rated as high as it is and i why i am keeping it.
B00ELSJB1Q|5|Way less tacky then white.
B000C34KW4|5|Works great and easy to install
B00523AV54|5|Purchased this to replace the filter in our 5th wheel and fits perfectly even though it is not the OEM replacement. I did not notice any difference in the water quality or taste and since I replace them every 3 months the price point is great. I ordered an extra one just to have a spare in the trailer for what ever.
B000S2U49W|5|perfect fit
B005MZUN46|5|Smaller than I expected, but good thing because if they were any bigger they would not have fit on the back of my car
B00IT6VP6A|3|Arrived quickly and very easy to install.  Whatever they use to cut the letters left burns along the edges. Some letters look good but some have noticeable burns if you're close and looking at them.  They are very shiny and look good from five-six feet away.  These pics are just after being installed and cleaned off using a paper towel and windex.  Update: one of the letters had a slight bend from shipping and wouldn't stay flat. I contacted the seller and they promptly sent a replacement.
B011A4KMQ6|5|Great product. Easy to apply & looks great. Get a lot of positive comments on it, as I put it on my Smart Car.
B004ZF4MW8|5|i bought this for my GMC sierra and they look awesome. i got 8k to give it a little more meaner look but this lights are so awesome that i am going to go with high beams HIds and also fog lights HIDs . i also have that problem with my passenger  side flickering and sometimes only one turns on but i turn it off and on it and both come on but thats not a big thing u cnt fix . Highly recomend then. and to top it off the customer service is great
B00FH8P1DG|4|Shipping was fast and with a good wiring harness it works great. Mounting hardware is a little sub par tho. Very bright
B000A6X53I|5|American made for a good price. Why would you not buy this for your GM vehicle? Keep it all GM. Shipping was very fast.
B001ATBEK0|5|I first bought this at Costco when it was carried in the store several years ago.  Now Costco no longer carries it in the store so I found that Amazon had the best price currently available.  You just have to buy a four gallon case.  But I split the cost with friends who also love it.  I haven't found any crud that Oil Eater won't penetrate and clean.  I live on the water in north central Florida and we are occasionally invaded with aquatic midges or blind mosquitoes as they are frequently called.  Thankfully they don't bite but they make a huge mess when they die (lifespan is only a day or two).  They stain my fiberglass boat horribly.  A few squirts of Oil Easter and the stains just melts away.  Unfortunately, so does the protective wax so the fiberglass has to be re-protected.  It is also amazing on whitewall and raised white letter tires.  It can be diluted with water for less formidable crud but I tend to use it straight for almost everything.  I've never found another cleaner as strong or versatile.  Great stuff.
B009X1RNMU|1|Don't buy this product.  There is no baffle on the return line, so the fluid aerates and foams.  If you are buying this for a 4 cylinder Jeep...don't.
B002WRRNFO|5|Does what its supposed to do.
B0016HPUS8|5|Works great good deal!!
B00B3YMIHK|5|Awesome quality bag. Looks great, mounts easy. Locks securely. Comes with a waterproof bag to throw over but I got caught in a torrential downpour the other day without it on and everything stayed dry inside so just the leather is waterproof enough.
B003TXYJB6|1|So far so good.  Excellent replacement for the pump that came with my Harbor Freight parts washer.  Some have said they needed an adapter to get the nozzle to fit, mine went in OK.  It is slightly larger than the original pump and requires a little engineering to get into the housing on the Harbor Freight parts washer.  The only reason I give 4 stars is that I haven't had it long enough to tell how well it lasts - only a week and only used a couple times.  Update 3 months later Pump is dead.  I used it maybe six times.
B00COYNY3A|5|Great keychain
B005PYHYK0|2|Bought this for my wife's 2015 murano.  The style is great, and front seat fit.  However, the head rest and back seat do not fit at all.  Install the cover seat is not easy at all.
B00DNXGG54|1|Does NOT fit 06-08 650r
B008VDIVHC|5|Fits perfectly on my FRS 2015, makes my front a little bit aggresive
B00JB0RUSK|2|Fit ok, but too hot! material is thick, middle cupholder won't close after install. Disappointing considering price and custom product. Ended up returning and opting for a coverking product.
B00OK6SRVY|3|Look OK,  I Have not used them yet.
B00P2D41OQ|3|so far no problem, its just white maybe slightly little bit more brighter than factory yellowish bulbs<br />maybe its good for if you want it for looks
B000CRKONY|5|Perfect fit
B003CG9PIC|5|Easy to locate what I need through Amazon, works fine, no problems in shipping with everything thing I have bought!
B008G35TPY|4|as good as the orig one.
B0009T6EA2|5|as promised
B000BYB7EI|3|It looks like a cheapo knock off.  It fits and it sparks but it doesn't look much like the oem one.
B00OA7Q3AA|5|Perfect fit.
B004GBJAOG|2|suction cups are to stiff don't hold very well
B00W313JOS|4|works well - BUT I need a second one!
B009YRI64C|5|Loved it
B002JFQFNA|4|Great glasses. A little wide for my head.
B0049L6CP8|5|high quality
B003RVTEK6|5|Fantastic! If you're looking for Nissan car unlocker this is perfect! I thought about buying one from Auto zone for $90 glad I didn't! So happy with my purchase
B001EP294A|3|It does the job, and allows me to place those odd bikes on our rack.  I wish I could tighten it around the bases a little so that it did not slip up and down as you are handling it.  Got a finger pinched once while using it.
B00KQHJDB4|5|Very good product. FYI, the yellow is 5A, white is 8A, red is 16A and blue is 25A.
B004AGGHI4|2|this filter was not a DIRECT replacement as advertised.  I made it work, but had to modify it slightly to fit the cage.  I have washed and recharged the one I replaced, and it will be going back on before I ride.  Because of the nature of these things, one cannot simply &#34;return&#34; them, as they are pre-greased and it is too late once you find out you've been given wrong product
B00DP7NDXG|2|Good looking center caps . However just washed them for the first time today and 2 of the 4 wreaths around the crest are becoming  loose and about to fall off. Cheap product
B00FMUYYT6|5|2013 Silverado. With factory bedliner. These fit perfect. Great price. Beat the Dealership price by far. Fast shipping.<br />Update 08/2017: just bought 2nd set (for mid-bed and front of bed location convenience). Still a great buy. And again fast shipping, good packaging. Get a set before they sale out!
B004UQR1UM|3|It works fine but is not what I expected for $16. This is more like an $8 item when I compare to other tire/wheel brushes I've purchased.
B0017R5EQK|4|Seems to work fine.  I always hated using the carbon pile load tester on car batteries since a battery can only be discharged and recharged so many times.  I have only had this for 2 months but we use it in a shop and I find myself testing more batteries .  fast and easy
B0006O2S0U|5|Nice gage. Very pleased for the money invested.
B002XM5E6S|5|Worked perfect
B005C9CAUW|5|Love it!
B00199F2WW|5|Part worked just like it should.  Prompt delivery.
B006OQ35GU|1|it leaks
B001JSY9Q8|1|Don't bother. Fell apart in the first 5 minutes.  Cheap and shoddily made.
B006FXGSI4|3|Well, I expected better. First of all, this product was slightly too small for my accord and didn't cover tthe entire area of a fog light, secondly, it doesn't have a blue reflection when lights are on. However, it looks nice with lights off and is a really good protection. Easy to install and remove.
B000FGI5HE|5|Still have put it on my bike yet but will soon
B000CGJYZY|5|I am completely satisfied. I installed this about a week ago and it works just fine. I see no reason to spend twice as much to purchase it from my local big name auto parts retailer. I had this unit within 3 days. 4 hours later I had a running van for a quarter of the cost of the repair shop and half the cost of the local auto parts store. The only trouble I had was converting the electrical connector to the &#34;upgraded&#34; connector. It is a PITA while laying on your back under a van. This new plug is the way all the new fuel pumps are manufactured, it is not specific to this pump.
B000E5W9MS|5|Quick delivery,great product.
B002ESCOPA|5|Great value, awesome quality
B000C7QC4O|5|Perfect fit and works amazing
B000CG91IO|1|Does not fit 3.7L V6 (2002 Dodge Ram 1500). Amazon app said it was compatible. Quality of product is fine.
B000760FX4|5|Perfect, good construction shipped with ease.
B005SUVQUK|5|this thing saved me so much time.  My brother and I spent days trying to get the bearings out of an old bike.  This took literally 30 seconds per tire and was flawless.
B00666HTB0|5|Yes
B00BTL73U4|3|Had trouble getting the old off ...  took truck to a body shop and found the bumper 1) not the correct size and 2) slightly out of line  They did what they could to straighten and fit it to the truck
B003ZOH63W|5|As expected.  Good service.
B002UC17GW|5|Fit & worked like a charm
B00E1SKO3U|5|Met and exceeded my expectations !
B00LULJIW4|5|great
B000GKD5NI|1|Bought this to block the sunlight from my babies face since she is rear-facing. Didn't work at all, plus gravity pull that thing down within minutes.
B000C7Y9B2|4|Works fine, but time will tell if it's made of quality components to make it last!
B000F22R22|5|Perfect fit.  These are very nice mats.
B001O0VP9A|5|Great pads. Have them on everything and get at least 90-100k out of them.
B00CTVXUK0|5|Worked great
B008QBT52E|3|Not very exciting. It works.
B0038YO9Q6|5|Excellent
B005DUKGNI|4|I like the led's smoothness, with better brightness. Hopefully they will last a long time.
B003VGO8SK|5|Yes did its job as well as wiring included
B00V6QMTIS|5|Super bright HID's for a good price, and KENSUN custumer service is exactly how every business should operate.
B00RUT973K|5|Very good quality would recommend for any pit bike or small wheeler
B00IRPPZQO|4|Currently on a 08 Honda but the install was nightmarish. I had the owners manual out because no instuctions included, no adapter for my wiper style. Sent a J hook setup, not what I needed.
B001AWLJG6|5|Love this thing.  Works great in the shop when working.  On the trailer makes loading simple and way more secure.  Great investment
B007BLMWZW|5|Just swapped these into my van and they work perfectly!  Installed on 2003 Town and Country with no problems.
B00B2Q0YV6|5|Perfect fit and very durable.
B0010GAY4A|5|works great
B00S41HVTK|5|ok
B0049Z8JNC|5|This is the &#34;correct&#34; part. 20 minutes out with the old, in with the new!! No more clatter!!!
B00QMTAZ1W|5|Exactly what i expected and wanted. Good buy for the money! I liked it so much i bought spare.
B00MQAG1X2|5|Looks great on my 2014 Mustang great product.
B003ZWHLCU|4|Fits and works well
B00ESXAVWM|5|QUALITY A1A
B00C5RBRA8|5|Great product.
B00BYEESZE|5|Awesome
B0067UF7LE|4|Nothing special, except reasonable price!
B00IDG6Q0Q|5|works
B00P2SE7C2|5|Went on easily and looks great.  Looks so good i might have to think about doing the rest of the truck.
B00WONEI22|3|these emblems are plastic and feel a little cheap, also some burs on them from the mold. Shipping took much longer then other products from the same country. Over all they will work.
B001FN7NSS|5|Excellent ride quality. Recommend buying the bushing kit and dust boot when replacing struts.  Definitely recommend.
B00KIGPO98|5|It's really nice. My car is silver so I got the gray and black leopard.<br />It adds a little spice to the boring car tag.
B0057W1VB8|3|Get some super glue because of its plastic it's coming apart from the zipper to the latches but overall nice huge bag lots of room
B0009IBJBM|5|outstanding
B00XZ9N6J0|5|very pleased with item and the time it took to receive it. would be willing to do business with this individual again
B00404YQXE|5|Wiped the car fine
B00M78820I|5|This is a great sun shade and fits my 2005 sentra perfectly.  One of my visors is broken, so I was actually able to use the included sunglasses clip to help hold the sun shade in place.
B00BGC1QZO|5|This looks great my kids love it and I do as well.  It is heavy and well made. This is going on a yellow Dodge with black stripes down the hood.
B007GRFC94|5|ware good
B001AY2WLU|4|This thing is great, very well built,  I just wish they had included more phillips sizes.
B005OVB8K6|5|parts was as decribed and fit our vehilce without problem..actually took me approx 15 min and less had not been looking for my 15mm socket for it.Didn't remove the belt, just lossen it and removed the pulley with one bolt and dust cover, put new one back as renoved, tighen it slip belt back over it and the other pulleys, done, noise was gone. I plan to purchase the the tensioner and new belt later this yr..tw
B00CA5GOOE|5|Great product,I used to lose my Xm stations under trees with the stock antenna. This product is shorter, more durable, and sleeking with better quality reception.
B000VKRQ7O|5|fit good
B0017OTQNU|5|Came at a timely manner, and I can't wait to gift it!
B001GG09GW|4|OK
B00LIXZLR0|1|Hardware didn't fit positive and negative wire were backwards bad quality
B008M1WB7E|5|have them in every vehicle....love them
B007U93LRI|5|It's a sticker, it sticks!
B00QXODI1A|4|Bought this for my son's HD Night Train. He really liked it. It matches his color scheme on his bike.
B000CMJ5MA|3|I think I would have preferred the flow master. The Gibson is to quiet and it hangs low, I will defined nately be scraping it in the rocks. But that's fine because I only got it for the rear 2.5&#34; pipe. Keep in mind this muffler goes from 2 and a quarter to 2.5&#34; so it won't be compatable if you have upgraded the cat foward. Would have preferred if it came with a 2.5&#34; to 2.5&#34; glass pack. I will be replacing the muffler with a cherry bomb glass pack...
B00T9LR2E8|1|The absolute worse car wash liquid you could ever buy.  Do not go by the label and not wipe dry.  This car wash left water spots like you wouldn't believe.  If you do use it, wipe dry immediately after you rinse.  Terrible wash.  Meguir's and Mother's car wash is way better.
B000KE0T3O|5|Did exactly what I expected it to do.  Great product.
B001RU31HG|2|Works fine but is so small no real value
B00426L7EG|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B004UZDPY4|5|This bag withstood a very long trip we took. Was able to fit lots of things including two suitcases, a high chair, and a large painting. The bungie cords were not as strong as we would have liked but this bag is big and sturdy.
B000EBKG90|1|I bought this because I thought this was like some other sunshades I had before. I was wrong. These are silver in back and don't block out much light. I think the car feels the same whether the shades were used or not. The most annoying thing about these sunshades is folding them. They have to be folded in a super specific way or they will not collapse and fold. I regret giving it a chance and I wish I returned them right away.
B001AHZ8T0|1|Ordered this for my sportster screamin eagle mufflers part# 80503-07 and they didn't fit, too long.
B00RGGQCSK|2|Adhesive is weak. Rear are for super crew not super cab
B004HM0N4A|5|Great product. Thanks
B003VAV0L4|5|It was exactly what I needed to lower the adjustable hitch of a 4x4 3/4 ton truck.
B000BQUEWC|4|Works well
B00XFFRNE8|5|very pleased with mt purchase. the tires and rimes are great, great deal my last tire and rim cost over $125.00  order came in less than  7 days from ordering  will be a returning customer ...
B005DQ5C6S|3|These are high quality spacers but they don't have the rounded lug nuts to perfectly center the wheel. It's not that important, it just made putting them on slightly more difficult. I put these on a sportsman 500 and they have held up great.
B00SBZAG5U|5|Good quality frame.  Looks sharp.
B004ZF3DYG|3|I bought this set to replace the factory halogens in my F150. Installation went pretty well but had a problem with only one bulb igniting when using auto lamps. Had something to do with low voltage during engine start. Fixed it by installing a 10 delay at engine start. Anyway, after about a year, started having flickering issues while driving. Like they were bouncing from low beam to high beam on their own. I started to not trust them. Headlights have to work. Every time. So, I just put a new set of halogens back in. While doing that, I noticed some damage inside my head light assembly. I think the HIDs were overheating the enclosure. I'll try to attach a pic. Customer service is great! But, OEM bulbs are OEM for a reason, you can rely on them.
B00GE9Y5IE|5|nice installed in 30 min they look great
B005BNZGCS|5|exactly what I wanted. product in picture is what you receive. did not short out. no problems...no worries. only downfall is the lid on my rv hook up at my house is about 1/4&#34; from closing due to the handle on the plug....but it doesn't bother me.
B00DX89I9A|5|So far so good. We were sent the wrong exhaust pipe although the part number was correct.  The seller and manufacturer is working with us to replace. They have been responsive and helpful.it is taking some time, but that due to my circumstances,  not theirs. The pipes are beautiful and once we get the correct fit I'm sure we will be very happy.  But the seller has been very helpful and did not hesitate to resolve our concerns. Thanks for that. Based on my experience I will order from them in the future. The product really looks great.
B00K68QE4W|4|mounted in the shop trailer. will pull very good we use it to load dollied bike for transport
B00GSAUHB8|5|As expected.
B00QW3KIHO|5|Order it on 8/2, received it on 8/7. Great fit. Better than OEM since this is ALL metal.
B00AC70NIU|5|Perfect material and fast Delivery...
B0027UPPK6|1|It didn't work it would run the winch out it wouldn't bring it back in I bought another one and it worked fine so I know I was wiring it correctly it just didn't work
B00IS7B0XI|5|Watched several u tube videos on how to install.  When I picked these items you said they fit my GMC.  Everything went so well I cant believe I did not do this sooner to fix all the gauges sooner.  Shipping and the extra tools made the job even faster.<br />Thanks
B005BNYVWY|1|please do not buy.... i should have read the reviews before wasting my money... this tape doesn't stick to anything
B00GUJ2MJ2|5|My Technics Amp is back on! Ordering another set for standby :)
B005CEHTEY|5|Worked fine, 3M always good
B005LGURG0|5|Great replacement! Fits 2003 Ram 2500 perfectly, color is spot on!
B00GSAUHB8|5|product as described, easy to set up and fold, keeps the hot temp down,  size is okay for my SUV.<br />Great product for the price.
B00076FM00|5|Fits better than some other German style helmets he's tried before
B00NM8SYWS|3|Was Good choice
B000VEH5AS|1|Both rear shades stuck to window, so every time you rolled down window the vent shade would come with it. I have used this same product before on many f150's, 250's and jeep wranglers and never had a problem. Very disappointed.
B00C0XCHKG|5|Excellent Product, cheap price!!! Works well.
B00DSD57AE|1|Sucks
B00DWKXOMQ|1|The low beems on mine didnt even work and they weren't even wht color I ordered horrible!!
B0002UQAAW|5|The best thing ever! I like to clean and keep things neat and so when i got my car, couple months ago, i researched eveeything to get the nicest, cleanliest but not greasy or stinky thing and the Poorboy's Natural Look Dressing is my absolute favorite thing ever! I wish they make it for household uses as well!
B004YWPMW6|5|These look great while I'm driving, but when I'm stopped at a red light and there is car in front of me I could see them flickering. I'm not sure if its the ballast or the bulbs. It's been that way since I got them and installed them. Well the driver side finally gave  out, both the bulb and the ballast. How do I go about the 2 year warranty? I love the hid's so this isn't a negative review. Thanks
B00E9IEX2K|4|came in nice package look really good
B000C36B30|5|Belt fit my 1999 Camaro Z28 perfectly.
B00F73F7BW|5|I found the floor mats to be of high quality and a perfect fit. I have a Corolla 2015. I'm really happy with my purchase!
B00A6PFD9W|5|Comfortable, good air flow, and great price.
B004RFKBEO|4|Received it promptly and had it together in about 45 minutes. Only minor issue was that there are 2 sets of bolts (8 short & 8 a little longer) and the directions don't say when to use each. Common sense explains it all though: Use the longer ones to fasten the 2 inch bar to the carrier because that's when you will be attaching 3 pieces of metal together. The reviewer that said to wait until it's together before tightening it was spot on as well. Anyways it sits good, is extremely sturdy and the length makes the bikes fit on it perfectly. I also would order an anti wobble kit for it as I did. That really made it ride a lot better.
B000C9F7S4|5|Compressor worked well I am refurbishing my Blazer
B000MJSJ16|5|Be warned, you might have to use a C-Clamp to push in the brake piston before these will fit. Had to purchase one and push the brake piston on my car back with a piece of wood.<br /><br />Mazda 3 2011.
B00D1A01ZK|5|Love Love this! As expected, if not better!
B00LFL78OY|5|So far so good and a good price.
B001DRHMMS|5|Excellent fit and excellent instructions. If you can tighten and loosen a screw you can replace the cabin air filter.
B000FPY1XM|5|Thick plastic and reinforced in all areas that might be weak.
B0041U66PS|5|Worked great
B00YVQD4A2|5|works great. Secures the sunglasses to the visor and they are easy to remove
B00FMV0WFA|1|The floor console organizer is too wide for my 2015 GMC Sierra. Please advise as to how I can get the right product.
B00W5VA5X4|3|Loved the seat covers although I'm a little disappointed that the chevron was not grey, although she loved them.
B00F2OCTOE|5|Great delivery great product!!!!!
B00BZVYM98|5|I had lost the 2nd fob for my truck, bought this one, I had it working within 30 secs using the instructions on the page. great product!
B00LG07MZE|5|I love this sunshade. It fits my CRV 2015 windshield perfectly, keeps my car a lot cooler in hot summer days. It's large once opened yet small enough to put in my backpack when folded up. Love, love!!!
B00A93SXI4|5|Nice
B00EL0D2OG|1|The holder is very rigid, couldn't tighten it enough so when your drink was put it cup holder would turn therefore your would spill. It was limited on the size of cup you used.
B001B7BWK8|5|Fit like a glove and workd very well.
B004LF3A70|5|Replaced Elixar-12 in pop-up camper with this, had to put different mounting bolts in, and this converter had a green instead of a brown wire just wire the green as if it was brown.  Other than those 2 things the converter box was very nice seems to be better built than the last one.  Fit the hole exactly in the camper.  Also this was at my house in  3 to 4 days after ordering &#34;AWESOME&#34;.  Highly recommend this product.
B001V8UKBO|3|I bought this product several months ago in anticipation for a cross country trip with the hopes I would not have the opportunity to use it; however, unfortunately, fate intervened and I was forced to use it.  The front right tire (2 axle) blew on my 2013 Keystone Cougar (with a MOR/ryde suspension) on I90 just outside Rapid City, SD and I was forced to change the tire along the highway.  Fortunately, the interstate had a fairly nice amount of asphalted emergency lane so the ground wasn't an issue.  I had previously read that newer campers' suspensions required users to put a 2x4 under the ramp to give it the necessary height to change a tire, so I started out with a board underneath the ramp.  It lifted the flat tire sufficiently high enough that the flat easily was able to be taken off and, at this point, I thought this was going to work rather well until I tried to put the spare on the hub.  The tire lug pattern was still about 1&#34; too low for the spare to go on.  At this point I had two options 1) deflate the spare enough that it would go on (not really a great option considering how far I would have to go to inflate the tire again at a snail's pace) or 2) use a floor jack (which I had the forethought to bring along for the trip) to elevate it enough to get the spare on.  Obviously, I selected option #2 and it worked rather well.  So, considering that the ramp worked well enough to do 75% of the job and the floor jack did the remaining 25% of the job, I gave the ramp a 3 star review.  If it had been about two inches taller, I would have given it a 5 star review.  Take it from me, if you have a later model camper with advanced suspension, do yourself a favor and put two boards underneath (as some have suggested) or find a thicker single board to begin with.
B00MB8AQAS|5|works perfectly for half the price as the chain stores
B00DGU98VS|5|Exactly what I needed for my Polaris Sportsman 850!
B0040CVTAE|5|as advertised
B000A8OK6C|5|love it good quality !!!
B004OJZDAK|5|works great!
B00KRQGHVI|5|OK
B002XL2IBS|2|Way too flexible. when you turn the water on it flexes away from the water outlet.
B00TKS3FKA|5|Love it
B000C03QJK|5|Firestone put this air filter in my 2005 Honda Pilot and charged $33.  I replaced it myself this time for about $10 and it took just a few minutes.  The filter fit perfectly.
B0021Z1JVQ|5|Best leather protector I have used.  Found this product at a boat show 20 + years ago, have used on cars, couches, boats, it is the best.
B000TG4H68|4|Exactly what I ordered and good shipping...would do business with again...grips are awesome and feel great, would recommend to anyone needing new ones!!!
B000BQW5LK|5|This was a total lifesaver for filling the diff fluid on my C6 Corvette.  Since then, I have reversed the flexible tube to the intake side, and used it to remove fluids from other applications.  A great garage hack!
B00CUN77XS|5|Good quality.
B00OA66IG0|2|I feel like this is a good product... But I didnot get a chance to even try it.<br />The adapter they provided doesnot fit my pressure washer at all.<br />I should have known that when they say fit &#34;most&#34; pressure washers, i will probably will be the unlucky one.<br />Do you guys have a solution for me?<br />Currently , this is 100 wasted. Sigh.
B00HZ73AFS|3|The stickers themselves were good. We just had one complaint. They put it in a box rolled up instead of in a flat envelope. We had to put heavy books on the stickers for a couple days before we could use them.
B00C91OFMW|5|Awesome
B00BJ8ZZ0M|5|Perfect Fit! I was able to replace the faucet inserts instead of replacing the entire shower faucet.
B006RMQCFW|5|Essential for successful decal bonding! Use just after cleaning mounting surface with a clay bar and prior to spraying same said surface with Rapid-Tac Setting Solution. This removes completely from the mounting surfaces all traces of polish, waxes, and silicones that will interfere with Rapid-Tac bonding the decal. I sprayed and wiped clean each side twice with several clean microfiber towels/rags. When clean your fingertip will no longer easily glide but rather drag across with a light brush across. This was my first time to apply a vehicle decal.
B007ZFSGNG|5|love it
B000HDETOI|3|Bought the wrong one. needed the one with bayonets instead of pins.
B0002NIK66|4|it is small, be careful
B0081KZJAM|5|fits just fine. works great.
B00FFDPPCA|4|I looked a little different than what I took out but worked just fine.

B00INYAMVW|5|Was super easy to put on it only took two old people about 20 minutes to install it and it is one impressive piece of metal
B00LG07MZE|3|It does run a little big as described, it's an okay product. Seller delivered promptly and without issues other than the box practically destroyed during shipping but the sunshade was fine.
B001NYYREC|5|Great met all my expectations
B002YKMD3G|5|Works great ,Just what I needed to reach the adjustment screw.
B00UCAXECY|5|Arrived today. Looks beautiful on my silver car!
B008ESKFMI|5|Perfect fit.
B000E5XOZE|5|Awesome intake! I like that I can alternate it from cold air in summer and than to short ram in the winter. Nice blue paint finish and has a great sound.. Install took me about 30 minutes
B00HHGT9FW|5|Great price and functioned just fine.
B00J3NPOI8|3|Not as tough as I was looking for.  Material is thin.
B001CEJH0W|5|It is a filter.  I'm not sure what one can say about a filter other than it filters.  It seems to work well.<br /><br />I have mine set to &#34;Subscribe & Save&#34; so I remember to change out the filter every six months.  Otherwise I would not remember to change it out.  I spend over 10 hours a week in my car commuting to work so my filters definitely get used with either AC or heat running year round.<br /><br />I haven't tried other filters to compare.  Subscribe & Save saves me a trip to the auto parts store twice a year.
B00LM5692U|5|Car smells G-R-E-A-T..... Thanks.
B004VRREYI|5|Works as advertised and was a very simple installation with one exception, the instructions must have been written in China because they were about as clear as mud. This should give me the clearance I need for tight turns using my short bed Dodge.
B000VDSTHM|5|As described.
B005DJRDEY|5|Muy bueno
B000UKBWZ2|5|the heading for this listing is very misleading, the sale was for one 1 bolt.
B005FH2Q4Q|5|It is very bright. Works awesome.
B00BQBSE9G|4|Works well
B00WAJBVWU|4|It wasn't an exact fit for the carb on the Ryobi string trimmer I was working on, but it did the job.
B0098WDL8E|5|Awesome, great, love it
B008CLMBNS|5|Heavy duty construction, good fit.  Helps to provide more room inside your jeep.
B004JBWZZ4|5|Fits perfectly on my audi a6 c6
B0018YE9OK|5|Grandson car used to shimmy and shake before i put these on. Nice smooth stop now. He's happy.
B001JDE6ZW|1|Horrible product item was missing a nut to secure it.  After a trip to the hardware store I was good to go or so I thought after one 15 minute trip I lost the glass from the drivers side mirror and the second one followed suit soon after.  Waste of money
B00E0OYE86|5|Excellent quality! ! Just arrived today. Wasn't supposed to be here till next week. Very impressed. I will be ordering more stickers!!! :-)
B00IZNZOYQ|5|the best
B00HASW274|5|New mats look great. Definitely an easy but worthy replacement for the carpet mats it comes with. Easy cleaning, very comfortable, and durable/thick. Restores the new look to the floors of the car very well. Rear mat fits like a glove.
B003IS3HV0|5|Excellent product.
B008BZS6J8|5|Local Chevy dealership in Anchorage wanted $30 a qt.  I needed 2 qts. I had to wait 5 days for shipping but saved more than 50% for the same product.
B00F7S7GZM|1|Began rusting after a few weeks. The lettering is too big. It barely fits across the bottom and it looks cheesy.<br />Don't buy
B00LG07MZE|5|I like this sunshade because it fits perfectly in the front windshield of my car (2013 VW Tiguan).  For the past two years, I have been using one with two suction cups. In order for the suction cups to stick to the window, I'd have to wet them with saliva.  In the heat, the suction cups always left horrible rings on the window that I'd have to clean every other day.  This sunshade fits perfectly.  It's cumbersome and difficult to fold to put away.  But once you get the hang of it, it folds away nicely.  BTW, this sunshade is not rectangular like the picture on Amazon.  It's two circular shades connected in the middle.  It's quite large.
B002LGUANS|5|heavy duty, good looking. good purchase
B000C9DTAW|5|Part was a exact match by part number with rear ac control but photo was incorrect, was worried until package was opened.
B008BM3CYU|5|Very bright lights
