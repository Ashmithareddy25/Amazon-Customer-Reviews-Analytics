B000JNTEJG|5|I bought this for a 2005 Toyota Prius just to use with a bike rack. Install was easy, and it looks very good. It comes with everything you would need except for the ball and wiring kit.
B002Y2WEDI|5|These things are really nice. Well worth it if you ask me. Easy to install.and they look way better than the stock. 1989 jeep yj
B007C4QSUS|5|Decal was better than expected. Took a long time to arrive but was worth the wait.  Looks great on the car!
B003END2VE|4|Easy install looks amazing really bright just not a fan of the plastic clips and zip ties to hold them on
B00977GPA6|2|This are not nearly as good compared to other similar stickers I have purchased, they are also smaller. Less expensive than other brands and it shows!
B005MMPCDQ|1|Thank you all for your comments, I'll spend the extra money and just buy a Peake Research reset tool and avoid the hassle of trying to use an inferior product. Saving a few dollars is not worth the time or my patience trying to deal with a cheaply made product.
B00418U0AM|5|I have not applied this little fellow yet but I can't wait. He and Minnie will look great on my back window.<br />Arrived on time.
B00G620ZVU|2|I purchased these lights for my jeep when offroad but when I hooked them up the top strip of lights do not work. But other than that they seen to be okay for the money if all else fails atleast they look good. I guess you get what you pay for.
B009FNWOH0|3|They fit the truck okay but they seem to be too close to the rocker panels. I had the straight runners before but these will take some getting used to
B000JFNAJE|5|I purchased the pump for a vacuum bag operation. It is working well with no problems even though the frame in the vacuum press system has leaks! The pump arrived ready for use and started immediately once the oil (included) was added ... no mess, no fuss.    I tapped the handle exhaust to accept a 1/2\\" NPT fitting so that I can direct the oil mist (caused by leaking vacuum frame) to an outside area (used a 1/2\\" air hose) until the frame is fixed. Works excellent!
B0050MWHJA|4|I was looking to replace the old falling-down headliner in my 1988 Camaro IROC-Z, but I didn't want to hassle with hanging a new fabric one, so I bought this item instead. The headliner fits well and looks so much better than the original one it replaced. However, the color was more of a charcoal gray than the black that I had ordered, but once installed this difference was minor. I had to &#34;customize&#34; the cut-out for the dome light since the hole was not large enough to accommodate the way the dome light clips in. Overall a good mid-level restoration product, but if you're looking to do a professional resto and have a larger budget, look elsewhere.
B007TY7PUI|5|Used on a 2004 Jeep Liberty Sport and this repair kit did not only fix the problem it was an upgrade from the original factory bracket. Easy DIY project.
B005VLMTJS|5|i have been looking for a helmet for a while, I seen this one and ordered it on a whim glad I did nice helmet for the money
B0006IX87S|5|We use this to fill our hot tub, does a nice job getting rid of some of the stuff in our well water, except for the calcium, still a bit high, but not too bad! Water looks amazing, and balancing the chemicals was a breeze!
B001D6GYLO|5|i based my purchase buying off of other reviews. this thing works great. i have it on my dump trailer to keep a charge on my battery. i havent had an issue yet for the battery going down in charge. also have one on my diesel tractor. no issue there either
B00HJEXEF8|5|Worked great in my 2001 honda civic coupe. At first i was skeptical about getting these but i decided to take the risk. I recieved them today and installed them and they work great. They are as bright if not brighter than the incandescent bulbs.  Buy these and u wont regret them
B00NF1UPII|2|This works great and seemed to be the same size, but the little lock tabs on the side are slightly placed differently than the original and the button will not lock in place, it is still functional but sticks out a bit from the center console.
B00BMRRZ94|1|RV water heaters have two plugs, depending on the manufacturer.  Why not include one of each plug size, rather than two of the same size  these did not fit my Atwood WH.  The wrench can only make about a 1/6th turn.  If it slips behind the plug head in the process, it can be a hassle getting it realigned with the head.  Bottom line, a ratchet works much better.  This will sit in a box to be used only on that occasion when I have misplaced the ratchet set.
B008S8YOIK|4|good for the money
B0012TRBT6|5|It has only been a few weeks but so far so good. I will have more to say 6 months down the line.
B0007Z0TAY|4|it has anything that you need and what you do not need. good durability, good price. i recommend it as a tool that every beginner electrician should have.
B001DKM3SI|4|It worked well the first time but the cord fastener broke right away.. The manufacturer sent  a replacement mop head promptly. For the price it  does what I need, but be careful as it is not a heavy duty tool
B00407FUU4|5|Very satisfied with the product and quick shipping. Thank You.
B00EAOIR8O|5|I have a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland.  I bought my car used, it was 3 years old already.  The car is in great shape but after sitting in the sun for a while when the air would first cut on it would have a musty smell to it.  I replaced the cabin filter with this one, and now the air is nice, crisp and fresh!  I would recommend this to anyone.  And, it was way less expensive than getting one at the dealership, and was VERY easy to install.
B00IB24DIE|5|was all my expectation
B001EGT3I4|5|Bearing fit perfectly in a 2004 Cadillac Escalade AWD, even though it stated the part does not fit.  Runs perfect, sensor is working....  Very nice part.  Getting the old one out was a real test, but this one went in perfect, and works perfect..... Very pleased.  The plug on the hub plugged in perfect to the plug in my truck, the mounting points were correct, to route the wire....  I have no complaints.  It was as perfect as the factory one.
B007KPTV5I|5|I messed up and ordered the wrong brackets but I sent one email and everything was fixed. They sent me my correct brackets and I sent the other ones back with no headache. Very simple and easy business.
B000C9JSBG|5|Good product good brand-name good price
B001ABMRVI|5|Fits perfect, hasn't really changed MPG but I do feel it does pull in more air. I like it because it's not an oiled filter. The 1.8T already has enough oil in the intake system, no need to add more with an oily filter.
B0055463T8|4|This cheap little brush does the trick in all the tight places of a dirty wheel rim, five-spoke to multiple-spoke.  No signs of wear after a dozen or so full car washes...JS
B003ZA7HUS|1|We use the ecopod from chemical guys as well. This lil portable unit WAS awesome!!!!  It HELD pressure for quite a while!!!! And the adjustable spray patterns are a great feature. For those on a budget, this is a marginal quality product.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />Went to use this on a clients car. Havent used it in over a month due to surgery. I filled it 2/3 full began pumping it up and it was squirtin out along the seams on the side of the bottle. NOTE: We always stored unit empty and depressurized...This product is not worth the money. Now I have to figure out what to do with it
B0040UAVOG|5|100% A OK !!!
B00IY3YLCI|5|everything it was excellent
B008Y2CH84|5|This product was recommended to me this year while n vacation and my outboard would not idle for very long....I double dosed my tank...What a great fix in a bottle....thank you Rich at Chapmans Bait and Tackle in Black Lake NY you saved my vacation along with the K 100
B001U6DMSK|1|The covers fit my seats, but that is about the only positive. The material of which the covers are made is very thin, easily ripped, and very staticy. Any hair or fuzzer is easily attracted to the material and embeds quickly. The covers need to be cleaned with a lint roller and vacuum. Vacuuming alone will not clean this terrible material. Upon installation, one zipper broke. Upon use, another broke as well. This product seemed like a good deal for the price, but you end up getting less than what you pay for.
B00APE6Z0A|1|Did not match paint
B0065N5WEU|5|This is a great product. I spent 3 weeks unlocking my drivers side by climbing though the passenger side. The installation was easy once you got the inside door panel off (the hardest part is the window crank). Total installation time was about 30 minutes.
B000CMDA12|5|The unique key design of these heavy duty wheel locks adds stylish security for a cost that doesn't break the bank...
B008A77ZY4|4|My four BMWs came with two different styles of screwdriver.  This is the cheaper of the two OEM styles, but it is just fine, and exactly like a couple of my original factory screwdrivers.
B003NZ71A6|5|Good fit. Shipped fast. Looks nice. No complaints
B008IJNSTK|5|Perfect, runs better than new!
B003S6M4Z2|5|Very good service and fast !!!!!
B000BYB3J2|4|Very good product!
B001534XXG|1|There's nothing about this item that is actually \\"wood.\\"  It is a shiny metallic keychain painted to look like \\"burl wood.\\"  Within a couple of months of daily use the finish chips off and it looks like a piece of trash.
B000EVU8X4|5|this is a great looking gauge
B005WURAP6|5|High quality. Buckles are plastic and clip well. Hold plenty of things. I am happy with this product and recommend it.
B001IH8Q0A|4|Purchases a cargo carrier for SUV - unfortunately it had a 2&#34;<br />This adapter worked great, unfortunately doesn't come with a pin to secure it to vehicle hitch - went to Walmart and purchased one for about $3.<br />Good purchase, will continue to use and would recommend to others.
B003IS3HV0|3|Product is like honey, thick, and you will have to massage into the leather. After soaking and rubbing off my old cover are softer and better looking.
B001P0ZA86|5|Works GREAT.  I have used this on GM Vehicles... works better than the installed break control on my Chrysler.  No trouble at all.<br /><br />I look at it this way - the last time I had a controlled installed on a new car it cost me $400.  This was ~$350 and I'll never have to pay the $400 again.  I drive a company provided car, which I cannot modify and changes every 6 months, therefore this is perfect.  Love it!
B00NVSDJI8|5|perfect fit great feel and durability.
B00LCFHKCS|5|had to give these a slight charge (probably in storage for a while) but other wise no complaints.
B000FGE9ME|5|Came to Alaska in 3 days. Fit my 04 V Star 650 perfectly
B001660VRE|2|I bought this for a Mazda5. It is an upgrade to the one on the car but I had to use a hammer and bench clamp to get its holes to align with the old holes. Because of that, the mounting screws are not snug to the frame. Came quickly and it was nice that they came in pairs and didn't make me order separately but I think it's a stretch to claim they are ready to use out of the box.
B00LSYW6QI|5|It is a nice touch to ane car when you have it all cline. It will fit on a Hawaii plats and U.S. Kind plats. Heavy duty but lite
B003YKVPMU|1|Bought 15 for scout gifts and only two worked.
B0055LVFTY|5|I saw this sticker on a friend's car. I was surprised to learn I could buy this at Amazon. Awesome!
B00C5RB03W|5|fits tights and you can remove the fishing line attachment string with aluminum wire if you are worried the string will break. So far they have stayed in with no problems. The only thing I can say is that they are super hard to remove, being a good, tight fit. But over time and with more use I am sure they will be easier to remove. We have a Coachman Freedom Express 261 and it works with our square bumper
B003ZWEF60|1|It just  broke after I ordered it and got it installed 3 weeks ago.  Update: the replacement broke too. Going with Dorman now.
B008B9EC38|5|Very WELL Made AND CLEAR Optics NO problems
B000HYL20G|5|Vital to those who drop screws often or are worried about losing screws.
B00USMIJTY|5|Sticker was just as described
B00020CM04|5|new cars should be built using this stuff sound is so much better
B005FIYEU4|2|Disappointed in this as it doesn't work on all cars. It worked well on my 1999 Dodge van but didn't work on my 2009 Dodge avenger. I contacted the company twice and got no responce.
B00EI6CKVE|5|Looks great!  Great service. Fast service!
B002UC4XHM|5|worked great!
B000C34L9G|5|works as design
B00A8MZ7IA|5|I just ordered these but used them right away when they came! I love the way they make everything look so clean! I have switched to microfiber to do all of the cleaning around my home.
B0034G2IFC|5|Great fits perfect Thanks
B009TBIALC|4|Item was as described. Packaging was all torn apart, with one flap of the box torn completely off and taped back on.
B005USYXKA|3|This tools it useful , and easy to install for the part , and it's sanding well for what i need.
B000CHZMYA|1|Wow, I've only had this alternator running in my car for about a month and the voltage regulator is going out. And of course, the return window closed a week ago when it started to crap out. And of course, the two year limited &#34;warranty&#34; is only reimbursed roadside assistance if the alternator dies on you, you get reimbursed after the fact for 60 USD.<br /><br />Won't buy another, can't get a replacement, will be looking for a remanufactured alternator with a lifetime warranty. Learned my lesson here, a brand freaking new alternator can start to die out in a month.
B003YHMNP6|5|very good. I recomend.
B0002M79Q4|5|This mirror has a nice wide view. Got it at a great price with free shipping.  Nice quality, fast shipping!
B007LI9O2O|3|Scent is a little strong, but certainly very cute!
B0040TC2WG|5|Product is Awesome.
B00923B8SE|5|They look great...  you have to custom fit them.. but again,  that's the whole idea.
B001DH6EYA|5|Good quality filter and will buy more.
B0050VGZLM|5|I have tried several other finders but this one is the first that deserved a 5 star rating. The others that I tried wouldn't even deserve 2 stars.<br />In the past, when I lost the back of one of my receivers, the company replaced it with no charge. I have 2 sets that I'm currently using. My only problem is that I haven't figured out how to attach one to my wireless mouse?
B001EDBEZM|1|It should be zero stars.  I have used ED lye since I began making soap because it was lovely lye, easy to dissolve and ED is easy to work with. However, ED is now selling contaminated lye.  A basic recipe of coconut, palm and olive oil with an 8% superfat does not set up with this lye.  After 24 hours I can stick a finger through a 5 pound log.  There is a pool of oil on the top of the loaf.  I have 2 of these loaves.  The same batch of oils sets up fine with Rooto and with another Batch Number of ED lye. I have 2 of these loaves.
B000GVNDFC|5|fast shipping, looks great on truck, thanks
B004BRR7AY|4|This programmer did what I expected but I've had problems with it shutting off. In turn I have to manually unplug it every time I turn the truck off, when I turn the truck back on the unit has trouble booting up. This could be installation error but the diesel shop that installed the unit has been around a while and installed dozens of them. Anyway, I haven't been able to find anyone else online with this problem so??? Just my luck I guess.
B000FW2MCM|1|Barely usable
B004L5KK0A|5|These are too cute!  They took awhile to install and I got a bit confused on the back seat (still not really sure if its on there right), but I absolutely love them!  They are soft and nobody else has any car seat covers quite like these, they stand out in a good way.  I get compliments on these all the time!  Highly recommend them!
B001AVSIOI|1|Like others have mentioned the oring does not make a good seal because it is so over-sized it is useless.  My first one froze up and I had to cut it off with a angle grinder.  The key broke because the inner workings were frozen up from salt and moisture getting inside.  Minnesota winters are good at destroying stuff like this  I bought another one by accident because I had a couple of different ones in my shopping cart, but rather then return it I gave it another chance.  Well when I installed this one I put my own oring on it that is the proper size so I wouldn't have the same issue.  I just went out to remove my receiver to put my basket on my truck and the same thing happened.  It looks like moisture and salt was getting past the protective rubber cap and got into the key workings.  Long story short I have been through 2 of these and both of them resulted in my using my angle grinder to get them off my truck.  Never again.<br /><br />And the red fades to pink in the matter of 2 months.  I really have nothing good to say about this other then no one is going to walk off with your receiver.  So secure you can't even take it off!
B004YID69G|5|Bull bar is exactly as described. Fits perfectly in the tow hook bolt holes and is a breeze to install.
B005JVEZ0Q|5|Nothing to say but replaced in my Acura and shifts smoothly. Defiantly worth getting if it is compatible for your vehicle
B00LPP46GI|4|Decent quality. Slightly heavier than expected but ok for indoor/outdoor. Soft interior but, like most covers, you'll never get it back in the original case without a lot of hard work!
B002U22TTQ|5|I bought this for my 2005 Harley Road King. This was a very easy install, took about 40 minutes (I'm old and slow). These look great on the bike and really shows off when I use my LED lighting (also purchased from Amazon). I bought from Amazon because it saved me money on the product and on shipping,
B003NOAIHK|5|Great quality product
B009PBAHN0|5|excellent purchase, as advertised
B008G348WO|5|Looks nice
B0024E70L2|5|This item is almost perfect because the one 110v plug is a straight one instead of being 90% angeled like the other two are that way when you plug them into the R/V site box the door will shut flat . Neatness makes happy campers also nice to draw .45 Watt Volts for when slie only offers 30Amp inuts
B0057CD6AM|5|i like them worked well
B001445IZ8|5|good
B003SY606I|5|A pebble on the highway destroyed the original.  This is an exact replacement and it was affordable.  No struggle to install.  Just need a phillips head screwdriver and 5 minutes of spare time.  Works perfectly.  Very happy.
B000X25OGK|5|Cargo liner was as described and delivered promptly. Good quality.
B00EFYOLHK|5|Great set i have one prior to this just needed a new one to have
B00915JI08|5|Been working fine. Fit perfect. Glad I bought it!
B000IYBERG|5|Bought these for my 2001 honda accord ex ulev and they worked great. They fit perfectly and add a better look to the top of the engine. As performance I did feel the car run smoother at certain rpms, I can feel more power but not a lot. That could also be because the wires I had on before were original and the car has 170000 miles on it. You really get what you want out of these or what should be expected of spark plug wires.
B00JUH0NFG|1|Does not do what it says.  But they refunded me.
B00Z6KLL66|3|This fixed our inoperative door lock, but it has slightly different logic circuit than the factory part.  When the key is turned on to start the car, the door locks do a quick click-click cycle for some unknown reason.  The locks work normally with the controls or the wireless remote, but once in a while the alarm will arm even though the doors have not been locked.<br /><br />Not perfect but a lot of money difference in price, compared to the factory part.  This is very easy to install, needing only a screwdriver (to remove the screw from the armrest pull pocket and one plastic screw near the front edge of door panel), small pry tool (to remove the door panel and mirror trim inner panel), and a short cross-point (#2 Phillips tip) screwdriver to unscrew the two screws holding it on.  No other disassembly required.  There is an inner window run which can be removed with one bolt (window should be up for this job), and it makes the job easier still.
B0000AZ86M|4|Bought as a direct replacement for a gauge I ruined by running the outboard with no battery.  The engine has no voltage regulator and the the voltage went quite high and burned out the meter.  The gauge is comes with all the hardware for installation and the backlight works well but it's accuracy is a bit lacking.  Using a volt/ohm meter (fluke 85) on the back of the gauge shows the gauge reads about 1/2 volt low.  Not a big deal as it's more for telling me the battery is charging than the state of charge but disappointing none the less.  Construction is a bit &#34;economical&#34; so time will tell if it will hold up but I would expect to only get a few years out of it.
B00KCQSOAA|1|They are so easy to damage just got mine and it's already wore some
B0034TVGL6|5|Delivered to my door  Installed in minutes  Looks great Less brittle than original equipment Best price
B000E267XI|5|No complaints what-so-ever. Worked and works great!
B000KEUFME|5|Great for accurate RF tuning
B008970MD6|5|Fits my 2007 Ford Expedition perfectly.  Has posts and sticker backing.  The posts locked it in place very securely when I pushed it in place to make sure it fit.  Did not want try and take it back off to peel the sticky side for fear of breaking the posts.  Looks great compared to the old faded one.
B001URVKS8|5|12/17/2014 i love the glove and takes awhile to break-in, but once it is it's a great glove. The only thing i dont like about this glove is that the grommet needs to be little longer and wider. (hence the 4 stars)  2/6/2016 It has been a little over a year of constant hard abuse. These gloves hands down are the best gloves for the price. They almost look like the day I bought them. They are EXTREMELY durable. I wear through MANY gloves every winter season. Before I bought these, winter gloves would not last me more than 4 months of use.  I now use a rather light heated glove liner with this glove, I can now go into the negatives. I use them everyday for my 70mile (round trip) commute to school. I ridden into the low single digits @80mph and my hands are very warm.   I'm 6'0&#34; and 260lbs with a rather large hand. I usually wear a XL when using latex gloves. These XL leather gloves wear a bit too big. I suggest a Large if want better dexterity with the controls.   They take a couple months to break-in, which can be hard on one's hands. I would suggest to soak them in boiling water for a couple hours and volia!
B000CSQETQ|5|Installed and has worked as it should. I have purchased these coils at Auto stores in past and paid almost twice what I did and it works the same. Only difference I found is this itme didn't include the dielectric grease. I have a tube so isn't an issue. I could buy a big tube of the grease and still save money and can use on other jobs. Would recommend this item.
B00KTIUM88|5|Works.
B00NR2FVRA|5|Workes great, bike rides the same as stock cdi box. It is smaller than the stock cdi, but other than that works great.
B00GYHKN28|4|I like the scent but it only lasted a month.
B009GN9YFY|5|Delivery was very fast!  I was concerned that the amber would not shine bright enough with the amber turn signal lenses.  After installing these LED's, they are very bright and all my concerns were relieved.  Truly plug and play!  They definitely stand out and are well worth spending the extra money.  Thank you
B000E4PV42|5|Very good
B00OU0PBY6|4|Easy instllation and good quality light every thing is very good except the socket in the shadow lamp littel bit biger than the original socket so it is littel bit flimsy and i put a small paper under socket to fix it.
B000BWE2YW|5|After replacing my internal tank pump twice, I added this pump and regulator to my Jimmy.  Not only did it increase horsepower, it completely eliminated need to maintain the in tank pump.  Replaced the brushes once in seven years.
B00AEVW4GS|5|Once you figure out what gear # you need, it will take about 15 minutes to remove and install this gear.  [...]  OEM quality and the seller was great to deal with. They processed the order very quickly and I received my gear sooner then what was stated.
B004RXKJ6Q|5|normal pully pullers failed to pull of my fly wheel on my 1985 IT 200.  This tool did the trick, and about half the price from buying it at the local motorcycle shop.  Happy customer!
B008K4BQAG|5|Work excellent !!!
B000CB3X4W|1|These fell apart soon after the difficult installation. We do not recommend these and would not buy them again.
B000GZM61K|5|Shipping was fast and fit good.
B0007LEG2K|5|Great Gift Idea!
B00IU158JY|5|Exactly as described. Pretty easy to install.
B00062ZFLQ|5|Not a car guy but this was recommended to me by a friend.  The change in performance on my Audi TT was actually noticeable after I fitted this.  So worth the money!
B000C581WW|5|I know that everyone says that a steering stabilizer doesn't cure death wobble but after my son installed a 4&#34; Rough Country suspension lift he got a bad case. We changed control arms (adj top long bottom) CA bushings (Moog) all tie rod ends (Moog from Amazon) still wobbled. The stabilizer stopped it as soon as it was installed. We wound up changing upper and lower ball joints (Moog from Amazon) and have an appointment for an alignment. This stabilizer is great quality and Amazon is the best price I found when you get it in Prime.
B00MB0F9DA|5|I love my new key ring bracelets! I always forgot my house key but now I have each of these colorful bracelets to attach it to so that I can easily wear it around my wrist. Good quality, fast shipping and they fit perfect around my tiny wrist! Lol love the colors too! :)
B005CNNLRY|4|Great fit for the Focus ST.  They were a bit folded when they arrived but once in the car they now lay flat.  This is not a thick rubber mat.  Keep that in mind.  But they do fit fell and work well to protect your cars interior.
B00JK020H2|5|Outstanding - fit well and significantly brighter than the stock lamp
B00B1TNQCS|5|Fits my 2014 Toyota Tacoma double cab short bed perfectly!! Great addition to new truck. Very well made and looks great. Keeps items from sliding around. I highly recommend!!<br />I will add a bolt with nut and washers to the drain hole to help eliminate theft of mat since it just lays in truck bed. Go to this site for instructions: http://www.tacomaworld.com/forum/2nd-gen-tacomas/16869-quick-bed-mat-mod-pics.html
B00S69UL10|1|brought for my 89 Jeep Wrangler they were too small they weren't long enough to lock
B009WDU4NY|5|So far so good. Can't say anuthing about longevity as I've only put about a couple dozen rides in so far. It is quiet ....well at least can't hear anything over my loud exhaust. Will update if it doesn't last long as needed at layer date.
B00B6A3NZ2|5|Arrived quickly with the other parts I needed. Quick and easy to install on my Honda Shadow! I recommend this.
B007XRCPUG|5|I bought these two for the driver's side of my car, and have double-stacked them similarly to how they are illustrated here, actually.  This really provides excellent neck support, as well as head, and ensures full protection in the event of being rear-ended.
B000CQHUJ6|5|Installed it a few months ago with a new muffler on my Tracker.  Seems to be working fine.  The end.
B001TR2F9M|5|Love it! Don't know what the other reviewers are saying about the bristles mashing down - I have used this for my porcelain kitchen tiles that have a real stone feel with grooves and crevices- after using the brush I couldn't believe how much dirt was pulled up.
B002AR0BLY|5|I installed this emblem with no problem on my car window. It was delivered on time and in condition as stated.  I would recommend product to anyone who loves SOA.
B000JG4GCS|5|I got the chain, so then I got the master links.<br />Do the job I needed to get done. Quality name, quality chain.
B007DKQ90K|4|fit great
B00L32LLPC|5|Great price for a solid cover
B004K8V6XS|5|Worked as presented.
B007PLZGO2|5|Nobody Cares about your Stick figure family chainsaw decal arrived to me just as described, put it on our car without any troubles. We love it!!
B003HBWM96|5|Exactly what was advertised & what I expected. Perfect fit, good quality & easy install.<br />Be sure to give the exact vehicle model & year.
B005EJGSQ2|4|My wife loves this in her vehicle. Works great and keeps you warm this time of year. Very easy to install.
B0002KKIUA|1|My keyboard &#34;keys&#34; stick. I thought that Gust might help to alleviate the problem, but it didn't.
B005UYRW5W|5|This product was a great buy, it's working well and there hasn't been a fault found with it to date.
B005H14LKC|5|OEM Delco so perfect of gaskets fit on 5.3L Chevy.  Was unable to use the bolts or pads on 2012 but my fault there.
B002MO9PIK|1|I received the passenger´s side replacement instead of the driver´s side.  I would suggest double checking before placing the order.
B000P59GGO|3|Plastics were nice, great color, looked good, Until I tried to put them on my 1991 Kawasaki KX250. Did not fit, Amazons \\"Make Sure it Fits\\" said it would but hey.... Sent back and refunded!
B0002M8QP2|4|The cable lock kit adapted well to my universal cover that I picked up at Walmart. The size of the eyelits on the cover allowed plenty of room to slip the cable through, which was my greatest concern.
B00KV8MN56|5|Excellent kit! I have 6 of these kits,  one in each of my vehicles. I have been running them for over a year with no issue. Seller it wonderful had no issue contacting them with problems and they stand by their product 100 percent
B009EKWIU2|5|Fit my 2011 Grand Caravan perfectly, sturdier than the basic Fram filters.
B008YA5CNI|5|Works great
B000GVDCQ2|5|This cover is excellent. Extremely soft and fits perfect.
B000VB2UII|5|I was reluctant to buy a fuel pump from online.  When the package arrived the box was damaged but pump was not.  The installation instructions were easy to follow. My car runs great.  I will continue ordering from this company.
B000ETAPX4|5|Very good product meets expectations thanks for the fast service i'm in the Memphis VA Hospital and i will recomend your company to the VA
B00BB1UMEG|5|Excellent design and fit, protects floor very well and makes cleaning easy
B00P0FS79Q|5|It worked great on my harley switchback.looks really good.
B0013RKEQ4|5|This bumper looks great on my 2011 Wrangler.  It was very easy to install.  For me, it was a one man job.  It is much better made than I originally thought.  I'm sure this bumper will last for a very long time. Highly, Highly recommended!!!  (Also, go with the Storage Bumper Ends.  They look great attached as well.)
B005F1YJ3I|1|I purchased a CR-1 from a local Walmart for my son's new John Deere Gator XUV 550, and it did not charge. The connector fit great, and everything was triple checked. When plugged in the CR-1 only displayed the red LED, to indicate it had power.  Poor product, I do not recommend even trying this.
B00CFALFXY|5|I know that this cloth is good. Delivery was on time. Satisfied.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Great package, nice carrying case. Has all the adapters. Worked like a champ. I have several 12 volt machines, movers, generators and ATV. Sick of jumper starting using vehicle. Instructions are adequate but could be better.
B009R57LBU|5|Bought them in the beginning of December and they held up great. Looks like I can use them for years to come.
B000E322VS|5|Great OEM oil cooler adapter! I used this with a Derale 6 pass oil cooler and about 8 feet of 1/2&#34; inner diameter hose. I cut the hoses off of the Dorman adapter and attached my own hoses to the cooler. Makes for a clean install. Use some leftover hose and slide it over the cooler lines to protect them from rubbing against the engine block (just cut a section of hose lengthwise and slide it over the tubing).
B0051TPJKG|5|I bought this for my condo. It is the right size for the rooms. I have not used it so far but I hope it works when I need it. I think they will at least according to the reviewers who actually used it. Reasonably prized and packed well. Arrived on time as promised. 5 StARS.
B007IQFJ5U|5|Love it
B006JD481Y|5|I wish i'd have gotten this sooner. It was easy to program and works great. It was affordable and much cheaper than getting it through Chevy.
B0075XR26U|5|worked so good, I bought 8 more for the guys
B005ESSY8S|5|I'm pleased with this purchase for ease of install and quality for the price.  Only drawback is that it makes my other mirror look like carp...lol.  I spent about 30 minutes installing and it only took that long because I couldn't get the door handle off right away.  Do yourself a favor and get a shop towel and work it around the handle until the small retainer clip flies off.  Then you can easily pull off the handle to remove the door panel.  Dont forget to put the retainer clip back on when you're done 8^).
B002GZ1TFW|5|So far the the Honda Pilot seems to be fixed, the VTM-4 light is off, TPMS Light is OFF too, and not to mention the price is right!! Thanks I'll be back when I need more parts.
B0068ODCDO|1|I purchased this product plain envelope no contact info. Item worked for three days replaced battery worked for two the replaced it and admitted to it being faulty the replacement worked for a day replaced battery still not working ended up having to go to dealer... Now I'm getting a hard way to go to get my money back
B000NPM23K|5|this was so easy to install just drill a hole and pop it in. This is a heavy duty grade it's on my 83 cutlass and we all know how heavy those door are.
B008899HSG|5|Looks good on a computer, as advertised.
B003E1GLSM|2|It looks like a good theft determent, but when I closed my trailer tailgate with a little more than normal force, the unhitched trailer jumped forward and knocked the trimax loose from the wheel and the covered lugnuts, enough that one could easily hook a rope to it and remove it without unlocking it. A waste of money.--unless you just like the way it looks
B000W7GLB8|4|We are pleased with this purchase. Was a little worried about buying such a large item over the internet but these worked well in our 2008 CRV. They dont' totally cover the floors, but they do the job. We have two small kids (and I am a bit of a slob) so we worry less about spills and other things. Plus, they are key to keeping the car in better shape after in wet and snowy weather.
B00CKKFDPA|5|Great product for the money - the adorn my golf cart and the neighbors get a good laugh of me coming down the street.Lights are very bright and there are many combinations of color and action to choose from.
B00D3298A0|4|These mat slip a bit.  Not as heavy as I thought they'd be in reality.  Still, I'm happy with them.
B003HV9UVY|4|High quality product and fit to my lexus ls430 , Thank You
B004VNIPBI|5|Great job shipping it out quick! Listed as it came!!
B000GUNW54|2|These are well made,but they are a universal fit item.they will not fit a Toyota Tundra very good,sent back bought Westin gen3 instead and they are great..
B000BK9JJM|5|Cover is great , easy to install and works for us great !!! Arrived on time and great boxing , NO damage at all. Easy instructions too !!!
B00521AHNW|5|Real sharp
B0009JKISQ|4|Conditions leather nicely, I was happy with this product.  Softens the leather and makes it feel almost like new.    Unfortunately, the zymol cleaner I purchased to use in conjuction with this product didn't do a thing for my leather.
B00AQBMM2W|1|These resistors will work to fix the can-bus lamp out problem.  However they need to be cut apart and completely rewired!  In order for them to work they need to go from positive to negative in parallel  on the both high and low beam circuits.  In other words one resistor needs to be wired from the low beam wire to the ground wire and the other resistor goes from high beam wire to ground.  That's only way it will work mine  came wired on resistor low beam to high beam wire and other resistor high beam wire to ground. If I had known that before buying I would have saved money and just bought the resistors.  Also it says there made from aluminum  but aluminum don't rust and bottom half of one of the resistors I got is corroded and rusty. Don't waste your money
B0013J9EGI|5|i live in the northwest and we have rain and snow and i tell ya what its nice to see better in the fog and rain plus its better in the snow less white out.<br />you can see lines better and and the road is always a plus
B001MA6W4K|5|We are pleased with the versitility of this bike.  It is a nice design and something that our son will get to use for a few years.
B000GZX2HW|5|Book was delivered quickly.<br /><br />It is a good manual to have if you have this type of motorcycle. Though they are never 100%, and always do more research on the internet along with videos. This book comes in handy to have.<br /><br />Would buy again.
B004LF90QK|5|fits perfect, looks great!
B00F3J2FW4|5|I have a 2012 Jeep Unlimited and read that these were for 2014+ That being said the 2008-2013 versions are not as nice. They are not contoured as nicely and have less coverage. Especially in the back seat where the 2014 models go under the seat. From my research it appeared only the carpet hooks were different. So I ordered to 2014+ floor mats on Amazon, and the carpet/floor mat clips from my local Jeep dealer.<br /><br />Success! It was quite easy to remove the old &#34;hook&#34; style clips and install the new &#34;mushroom&#34; style hooks. I had to pull up the edges of the carpet, cut a few small holes, and snapped together the new hooks. Well worth the additional time and $ investment to go with the nicer 2014 mats.<br /><br />In case anybody else with a 2008-2013 JKU would like the part number for the clips they are 5PL10XXXAA & 5PL11DX9AA<br />I had a heck of a time finding the right part numbers and had to order several wrong parts before getting the right ones. They did not have diagrams and the wording poorly describes the part. You will need 6 upper and 6 lower clips. Should cost around $2 per clip.<br /><br />If you want to skip the clips with 2008-2013 Jeep you can easily remove the front carpet clips and install these floor mats without a problem... however the rears will lift with the top/doors off and there will be holes in your mats where the plugs should snap on.
B005O0R0B8|5|Daughter loves that she can buckle easier
B00HV2KEG0|5|it's good stuff
B000LG4JEQ|5|Good quality and nice fit. It made my grip fit perfectly. I would buy another and I do tell my friends.
B00C7DDQU4|4|Not quite the effect I was looking for but a nice bright white.
B00BMPXGHQ|5|excellent product, super quality, fast shipping, recommend this provider, t.y. and bravo..i .believe in giving my opinion ok t.y. have a good day!
B007OW6LSC|5|OEM as described. Great price! Easy to install, just follow the direction from the box and there is more DIY guide on the internet.<br />TIP: take your time draining all the oil.
B0009JKI8G|4|I bought the Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blades for one of my Hyundai Elantras. They weren't the cheapest replacements out there, but they still cost under $10 so I gave them a shot. I had them installed in under 5 minutes. They fit and work perfectly. They clear my windows without streaks, and they are silent too. I give them 4 stars because I have Anco blades installed on my other Elantra, and they cost about 30% less. They also work equally as well. With that said though, I can still recommend the Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blades.
B005N53AM2|1|I've had it for 6 months or more and still haven't gotten it on my steering wheel. It's the correct size, I tried leaving it in the car in 100 degree weather to loosen it, but the rubber split on the inside and I just about broke my fingers in an attempt to stretch it over my steering wheel.
B00063XX5U|5|For the cv boots with a continuous type bands that you have to manually tighten at one end, this lil' tool save you some headache. Easy to use and tightens the band in no time. It will also cut the band ...if you prefer.
B00B4T448A|1|Don't fit the Burgman 400 ,2003 I took them to my motorcycle man and he said they don't fit to small so I take the lost
B00A448NYW|5|Wonderful product. Wiring was simple enough (instructions were useless) all the leds work
9539751047|5|Just what I expected...perfect!
B0056A3IL2|5|Came with instructions, and easy to apply. And it looks really cute on my window. I was very happy with my product.
B00O84WNNG|5|Prompt shipping product works well As
B003R7C0BU|5|Fits perfect
B000B5ZM6Q|5|Good value. Quality materials. Fit nicely
B001K69P8G|2|Too large for my 2013 VW Beetle.
B002UC1AYQ|5|This was a perfect replacement for my Thetford RV toilet.  Going into the project, it seemed like a lot of work to have to pull the toilet out in order to replace this valve, but it ended up being very easy and took about 20 minutes from start to finish.  The instructions are very easy to follow and went without an issue.
B001HSBW74|5|A few of my friends seen this on my camper and also purchased. Much easier than wiring a cut-off switch
B0002SRGWU|5|I like working on vehicles. I have used it several times and find it accurate and useful.  From,  Husband
B004FG5MFI|1|Product not as I expected. I was expecting a hammock type of net across the opening. This product is flat on the floor. I don't think this is very functional.
B0050H41E4|4|Nice bag/cover.  HOWEVER, note that my Shoei RF1200 faceshield (CWR-1) does NOT fit into it - its too long/wide.  The faceshield for my old RF900 fits, though.
B0012FKF9S|4|Worked great to hold our awning shade.
B000AMBOI0|5|This battery load tester does exactly what I needed it to do.  Each year when I get my camper out of storage I'm wrestling with whether or not to buy new batteries.  This tells you in about 5 seconds, just be sure to charge the battery first.
B008EW7HMA|5|Great videoscope that allows one to look inside lots of things, including gas tanks, engines, and those places where you just can't get enough light.
B001737OQW|4|Only reason it didnt get 5 stars was because the pressure guage dances too much to be read while the unit is operating.  Have to shut it off to see.  Fairly compact, not tiny.  Light weight.  Great cord length and tube length.  Easy on, easy off of schrader valves.  Rubber feet on bottom helps to minimize vibration.  Would purchase again without reserve.
B00F0M6RKA|2|You get what you pay for the plastic/rubber step is already cracking and I've had it installed less than a month ago,  not impressed.
B00FRHOO9O|1|Does not work as advertised. New wiper leaves spots on glass, does not clean up water completely.
B00P8XDPZG|5|its cool and i got to use it for my scooter,,, the starter alway kills my battery.. it worked .. small any convenient .. thanks
B003RIU1TM|1|Wrong color
B002J7VX4Y|3|The scent is OK.  To me, it doesn't smell exactly like a &#34;new car&#34;, but more just like a general plastic smell.  Or new electronics.  After spraying according to the directions, one spray under each front seat, the smell was gone after a few days.  Despite their warnings of potent smell, I think more than two sprays is necessary, and even then you'll probably have to spray about once a week to keep the scent fresh.
B000NBVFO6|4|Although the \\"view\\" through the scope is small and requires some getting used to, this tool does work well to look into small and obscure places. I have used it mostly just to inspect the piston heads on my outboard motor and car, and for general building work looking behind wall sheeting to find obstructions etc.
B0013FFLWI|5|unit worked as expected ,packing perfectly safe would recommend this to anyone who needs this bulb,this message requirement is a turn off
B00LCBLHDA|5|Great
B00JA0AHWM|5|It was exactly what I wanted! It's awesome will b buying again!!  Thank u so much
B005H12KV4|2|Unfortunately, after all of the work to replace my paddle type mirrors on my Excursion with these towing mirrors, they have a problem. The passenger side mirror only adjusts up and down, not side to side with the vehicle's controls. I double checked all of the connections, and plugged in the mirror on the other side to no avail.<br /><br />They received two starts because the heated defrost and the extended viewing make these a viable option, I'm just frustrated that I have to have a 3rd party adjust the passenger mirror when it should work as advertised.
B009A6W3UU|5|It is a good sweatshirt.
B00547IVXM|5|Another great tool for keeping my aging mother-in-law living as independently as possible. She has been forgetting where she puts things over the past half year. Sometimes she is hiding them because she is afraid they will be stoled,and other times they just disappear. Such were her set of keys. Four sets of keys &#34;lost&#34; over three weeks.<br /><br />We bought this set of &#34;finders&#34; and she immediately lost the next set. But, one press of the master fob's button associated with that particular electronic tag and we followed the sound to her closet and a box way in the back. In the recent month we have used it twice more and it always finds the missing ring of keys.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this product. Not just because the things are VERY useful, but the company selling them really stands behind what they sell.
B007IKN17O|5|it works perfectly. installed it and it starts right up. I thought I might have to do some modification but not needed. installed it on my 150cc. did not need a choke cable, that is a plus. it eliminates the cable going to the handle bar.
B000J4IEG4|5|good job, all very nice
B00RZNMZ9O|4|Do u also have the back strut
B0002Z9O6O|4|Product was as described.  Fit my 06 Nissan Frontier and made it easier to get into bed area with or without the bed door being down.  Good price and quick delivery.  Would order again.
B001BFTQT4|5|This part number was given to me by the dealer and it turned out to be the wrong part (looks almost identical).  There are two actuators in the door of my 2005 passenger side rear sliding door and the one that looks like this (black rubber insert) is a mystery....
B002SP69G4|5|Easy to put in and works great!
B000CPCRJK|4|I used it to cover and glue a set of cheap decals on my race car. the coating is rough but by god it works<br />I have not washed is with any thing - dosent really get dirty
B0049MTHTA|5|Really love the fact it is really a 3 in 1 product. Not only does it have the 4 and 5 flat pins but also a built in tester with the LED's. They're red instead of blue as in the picture but that makes no difference. It works perfect. Everything I wanted in one convenient product!
B006DEVAY2|5|These gloves work really good if you are buying them to keep your hands clean. If you getting them to protect your hands, not soo good.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Best sun shade I've used, it's big enough to fully cover every nook and cranny of my mustangs windshield and keeps my car much cooler from this unbearable Texas summer heat! Highly recommend!
B007PAHHWM|5|Cord is think and seems heavy duty. My digagnotstic port was loose so i plugged this in and zip tied it tight then routed the cord under my floor mats and next to my passanger seat. Worked like a charm.
B0023VE05U|5|EXELENT QUALITY!!!
B001LHW9YG|4|Does what It says. Reads codes to let you know what the problem is. I've found that repair shops still want to read the code themselves (and still charge the fee) even after I tell them what the code had been.
B004V6QB9I|5|my 90 yr. old mother in law was having a hard time getting situated in the seat as she got in the car. this little cushion has made a great difference for her. she is able to skooch  over into the seat much easier. and she can slide around to get out of the car easier too. the delivery was on time and the item was properly packaged with no damage. it has been worth the money to help mom in law.
B00BAYUI3E|5|Great fit in my Rava 4
B000FOL0AA|5|Perfect for holding items in position and avoiding sliding and spills.
B000CRKU7O|2|Not really worth it.  They went in OK and looked good but they were a little dim compared to clear/amber bulbs.  One burned out after a month or so, so now stuck with just one.  Took it out and put in clear/amber bulbs.  Try LEDs, that is what I am going to do.  Even is they don't look good at least I don't have to worry about them burning out.
B00AZWZQVQ|5|Product great
B000E2CVIS|5|It's an oil filter; it works. Pretty hard to screw up.<br /><br />5 stars because of the little nut which helps remove them later.
B000C5BUX4|5|This is a genuine Ford part that has a rubber cup bonded to the tie rod socket to prevent water from entering. Aftermarket tie rod ends don't.  They don't last long.
B00CASDZKC|4|The mat fits nicely against my seat and installing them was easy.  The only thing I would change is making the bottom starp slightly longer.  The material easily wipes clean.
B002R0D6AM|5|Oem replacement quality.  Perfect replacement.  Just what I ordered.  I was worried it wouldn't look like the other but it's identical.
B00DWKXHI2|5|Great lighting
B006J8L8VC|3|I bought these types of LED replacement from several vendors due to the inconsistency on the sizing of the bulbs. I needed them to fit into a tight spot and this particular brand was the only ones that matched the OEM type bulbs close enough to work. Take note... they are still just a hair longer and wider.
B0057FK08A|5|looks and fits like OEM at 1/3 the cost. easy to replace - filter sits behind glove box. release catches on glove box and then remove access door on filter housing.
B000F6F99G|5|Works great
B002T76Y52|5|Very good for the price ! I made a inside &#34;frame&#34; from 1/4 plywood & dowel rods so that it would hold its &#34;full shape&#34; even when empty----the plywood also made for bolting to the luggage rack which is more secure & stable !
B000L7OU8A|1|The jack would not work out of the crate,called the company was told need to get it repaired.  did not feel that I should ahve to have a new jack repaired
B00EW494O8|4|I was under the impression that it was made in the GOOD OLD USA, but not the case. I haven't used it yet to comment on how it charges?
B001G7TRQY|5|This was a simple installation.  Two slim spring metal bands are lightly scored at half inch intervals, so a pair of scissors to cut the rubber is all that is needed to trim to size.  My 2003 M5 again has excellent rubber on the windshield at minimal cost.  /kfj
B008SCV0I8|5|Works great, arrived promptly. Had to remove flywheel plate to install but otherwise simple bolt on job taking only a few hours.
B005CCJ25K|5|Great Product
B00DSD73T2|2|To large a little to much for this old gal,I did not put in on my car I pitched it
B000C19DGY|5|easy install
B0009IQZQG|3|Too big to fit with a typical jar of paste wax. I suppose they would work well with liquid waxes and polish. I however, completely underestimated the size of these. The feel is nice and they fare pretty well in the washer and dryer witch is nice. I would give them 4 stars if they were smaller.
B0056J2ZGC|5|The 1st charger I received had a broken piece.  It was replaced without any difficulty.
B00503L2ZE|5|Can't beat the price, saved over a $100 compared to my local parts house...
B008GMLM9M|5|Very nice I like a lot
B001GJ3FIS|5|Need a good hose that sees a fair bit of wear and tear. The plastic is medium duty and does not look like it will break easily when dropped to the ground. So far it has held to abuse.
B00QUTNVY2|5|I was very satisfied with the product and the service. Thanks, Lou kober
B00B8EL0P6|5|I filled in a three inch, to the primer scratch and I can't tell where it was.
B00BEIUY4O|4|I'm a Helmet Virgin, so this is based on my Experience with it so far (About 3 Weeks).  I'm riding a Moped. THE HELMET:  I'ts snug enough to feel Safe when I'm wearing it. classes have to be put on from the front so I have to remove them and put them back on after the helmet is in place. great idea on the double visor. the chin strap need some R&D. if I completely pull it apart, its difficult to thread it back through the buckle. But I finally found a way to secure it. I'm going to try maybe Velcro or small snaps or a hook of some sort.  I've been finding some surprises along the way.  the last being; I thought the two grey plates on the top were for show, but if you slide them back they are more vents. its well ventilated, so even at lights or stop signs, it still stays pretty cool inside.  I slide up the outside visor if its gonna be awhile.<br />  TECH support was good. I actually got a response.  I like the carbon-fiber look.  most importantly, I think it's well made enough to keep my head on straight in a Crash.  let's hope I never have to find out.  Buy this helmet!  and hope it outlasts you!
B0006O2PCQ|5|Smells like surfboard wax!  Love it!
B0030DEQKO|5|Fit like a charm and easy to install
B004AQZUX2|5|I was very happy with this product and the price. Look forward to doing business again I had seen the same product else where for crazy price.
B00HJDI22E|3|Lights up well, looks good, turn signal function is not very bright.
B004ZF3DYG|5|This is now the 4th car we have installed these in, great product and costumer support is awesome as well.
B00E63THQA|3|Just received this so the 3 star rating is an initial review as I have not had the chance to test the vacuum seal out to it's fullest yet. Why the three stars? Well, when I took it out of the box and moved it around it sounds like there is sand or something loose inside it moving around. So I figure something is inside, I open it up and remove everything inside, then I turn it upside down and it still sounds like sand or tiny pebbles are loose moving around in there somewhere. I know this is a minimal complaint but not so when I am in an ASL class that is filled with silent hearing people trying to learn and here I am making all of this noise trying to drink water because of some manufacturer defect. Also, don't bother getting the powder coating, chips off so easily, I rubbed my thumb on the bottom and pieces of paint chipped off.
B0083JLGOE|5|we Loved this for Grandpa's Car.....He actually removed his Dallas Cowboys License plate cover and replaced it with this one
B00CMV8DSQ|5|Well, this is a gasket.  It's a sealer without sealant.  Either these work or they don't.  Want to make certain it will work?  Buy OEM.  This particular gasket is OEM, fits perfectly, and comes with all the parts you need for re-sealing your Honda Element valve cover except for the Honda branded RTV sealant.
B001HQEUKC|5|Made my aftermarket driving lights look and connect oem eleven more words required, now seven more, now 4 more, this is rediculous
B000CFF8TQ|5|Great water pump for the money!! Built very durable and it only has one outlet and four bolt holes for the pulley just like the original on my 1964....If you're looking for something original instead of universal for your classic Chevy this pump is the ticket...
B003QK5QKU|5|I purchased 2 of these LED floor lights for my cabover camper. They are bright little lights and easy to install.
B004HCM9H4|5|Good product, my car is alway protected
B00LEZEER0|5|Great price, great delivery time. Exactly as portrayed. Yes they're plastic, but a good quality heavy plastic with a flawless finish. The plastic contruction is not an issue since these are not loadbearing parts. Easy install, but don't install reflectors until AFTER attaching covers to latches.
B00FYX0LV6|4|Relatively simple to install, the instructions provided were easy to follow. It looks very professional and clean when it's installed, not tacky like others that I've seen.<br />I've experienced power gains and fuel mileage increase of about 4mpg, which may not doing like much, but tank after tank makes a huge difference.<br />Very pleased, would recommend and purchase again
B0089GDBP8|3|seam on wrist ripped on the first day, had to re-stitch it.
B00EDFM3TY|5|I just installed all 10 of these in my RV trailer and first impression is they do the job very well. The Bright Cool white brings out the more natural light I wanted. I could tell the light was not as many lumens, but that's expected and I don't think I will miss them.<br /><br />Power usage is why I bought! I could tell the power difference immediately when I had all 10 LED's on and the fan on my AC to DC converter unit didn't come on to cool itself (Normally 3-4 incandescent bulbs would cause the fan to start). 3 Watts vs 17.92 Watts, so just about 1/6 the power usage or 6 times longer usage of my battery.<br /><br />Installation was a little tight when seating and you do have to use some force, but within reason. I did not feel like I was going to break the LED circuit board. When installing, if you DON'T hold on to the circuit board the SMD's are mounted to, but grip the plastic mount the circuit board is glued to, you can easily apply enough force to seat the LED bulb.<br /><br />Like:<br />∙Power Savings!!!!!<br />∙Light temperature and output. The 5050 SMD's really make the difference in brightness.<br />∙Diameter of the board holding the SMD's is 1.73 inches and that is perfect fit for a traditional RV light housing.<br />∙Replaces a 921 glass bulb from local auto parts store<br />∙Quality is just fine, SMD's are securely attached the circuit board and the board is securely glued into a cheapish plastic holder. (It will hide under a lens anyway so I will never see it)<br />∙Variable power is nice for when I'm on battery power or shore power and it changes.<br /><br />Dislike:<br />∙It would have been nice to have it mount as easy as a 921 glass bulb.
B001EP0GTK|5|fit was excellent/ usa made quality /easy install
B008M22I0I|1|1 star because the wrong item was shipped.<br /><br />on top of that, i could not get the savings matched because there was no more used at the huge discount.<br /><br />I feel like i was duped, so i returned both sets (i ordered the front's as well in a different order).
B008HLAIGA|1|Bought this helmet about a month ago and was totally disappointed, first a very cheap strap instead of a buckle being the latter the appropriate accessory to have, given the steep price of this helmet. Blinc Bluetooth is almost made of disposable material, the screen came off  the second time I used it and after just 7 trips on my bike and no more than 5 hours of use  it just died and never worked again. Helmet is really noisy when riding and overall looks made completely out of cheap material, some pieces just come of if you don't handle it with care, don't want to imagine what kind of protection it would give in case you really needed it. Want my money back.
B001KQRBKA|5|No issues.
B0096TRDZG|5|This thing has already paid for itself.<br /><br />If you live in NYC, you know how those meter reader cops love to write you up for &#34;Failure to Display.&#34; Not anymore with this bad boy.
B00IOABWL4|5|Love it
B005N53CBQ|4|These are good quality but fit a little big for my Ford Explorer. I'm using them anyway! I like the material and they will keep my seats clean.
B001DCN1S2|5|Some much cheaper than Toyota/Lexus and was easy to install and works perfectly. 2002 RX300.
B001MYWBF0|4|This unit is not bad for the money.  Digital read out has special codes that  are not mentioned in User's Manual.  Had to contact the company to find out  what they meant. Not enough diagnostic code info...should be expanded.
B00HMRDPBK|5|great item
B002TMXQS0|5|Factory floor mat on the drivers side was way too small, didn't cover very much.  The husky liner will hold a spilled cup of coffee or a large soft drink, even if you don't have a spill, it will hold all of the winter slush that falls off of your shoes.  Best floor covering I've ever seen.
B00KTHU1QM|5|Great Product!!
B002FMYXYU|4|Cheaply made but it works. Have used it to suck coolant so far. I'm sure it would work great for other stuff too
B002B3BM38|1|I wanted to love this, but it made a smeary mess of my windshield. And lucky me, I bought two of them!
B007Q4Y04K|3|The original truck lock I had became rusty and stopped working. This does the same job, and is kinda nicer, it isn't keyed the same as my cab, so if i need to take my truck to a shop or something, the people there don't have access to my truck bed anymore. Peace of mind. I wish the key was a bit bigger however.<br /><br />Update: The lock is hard to turn in cold weather with the small key, and the lock cylinder has started to not close all the way.
B00WQOCKME|4|This set has the basic tools that you would need for most jobs. I like that the 8&#34; adjustable wrench has markings indicating the length (in mm). That's useful to let you know exactly how much to open it. The 10&#34; adjustable wrench (the one that's good a vice-like grip) is also one of my favorites. With the locking mechanism you can attach to most objects tight enough that it won't come out. Useful for opening up rusty nuts, etc.<br />Overall this is pretty good. I would recommend trying it out if it goes on sale.
B002N4CKA4|1|I received a defective coil that caused me weeks of headache (and money).  I replaced several other items before realizing that it was my \\"new\\" coil that was causing engine issues.  Very disappointing experience...  I also had to pay return shipping
B004HE56AO|5|Put these into my 2000 ES300, along with AC Delco rotors.<br /><br />Brakes are smooth, no noises, like new.<br /><br />These are inexpensive enough for a pair, that there is no reason ever to cut rotors.
B001DRM8FY|4|So a few things on the install.<br /><br />First, get the bolts that attach to the exhaust pipe (lower bolts) from honda.  You should be able to reuse your springs, but the bolts will most likely be shot, and the ones it comes with don`t work right.<br /><br />Second, get a can of pb blaster and liberally apply it to every bolt that will be coming off.  Be careful as it may cause a fire if you spray it on while the parts are too hot.<br /><br />Third, assemble the entire unit to check the fitment of parts before you take your old exhaust manifold out.  Also it will be easier to take some bolts out while the unit is still warm (but don`t try and touch the old manifold while it is very hot or it will burn you).<br /><br />fourth, a haynes manual will come in handy for torque specs and steps to take apart/reassemble.  When you take the old unit out take pictures and keep track of your bolts.  While the new one will have some hardware, some is reused.<br /><br />fifth, after the old unit is out, you should put both the O2 sensors into the new one (I didn`t replace either O2 Sensor, but it is advised that you do).  They are harder to put in once the manifold is in the car.
B000CSINYK|5|great filter on my fill tank
B0010Z4MDK|5|It was in perfect condition, it is working smoothingly.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Fit on my GMC terrain. I love the extra space.
B0008G1OF6|5|It's a good padlock. What can I say? As for the \\"original\\" values placed on it, well...I don't know about that. But it's a good lock.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|It was just as I was hoping.
B000XECJES|5|Really great value, and these Zwipes microfiber cleaning cloths do a wonderful job cleaning almost anything. Better then paper towels, which we use way too often. We've had these long enough now that we have washed the 10 or so we put in rotation 5 or 10 times. They hold up well. They have been machine washed every time we use them and come back clean and ready for more use. In summary, these are cheap, but high quality cleaning cloths. Way better then paper towels. Better for the environment and the pocketbook. Thank you Zwipes.
B0057FK08A|3|It works, but its not as substantial or as large as the original.  This is not it if you want comparable or better filter - but it works okay.  It will probably need to be replaced sooner.
B007HRVQ8O|5|works and fits easily
B00KQHACMI|5|Great
B001J7M4QG|5|Great horn, sounds like a typical fire truck horn. Nice flexible fitting and mount bracket. I would definitely recommend for a true emergency vehicle sound. Unit is very large and requires a lot of mounting room.
B00AMEMACU|5|Very great lights!! Look amazing in the rear bumper of my 2010 ford f150. Took a little while to mount but when your cutting holes in your truck, ya gotta be carefull. Would recomend to anyone lookin for bright A$$ reverse lights.
B0013ERRSK|5|I did not want to write a review in this item prematurely. As the title suggests, I am a long haul truck driver who brings the furry companion with me. I have been using this for over 30,000 miles now and it is truly epic. Whoever designed this it's my hero.<br /><br />It sits adjacent to the food bowl on the passenger side floor. It has seen the steepest mountain passes, occasional rough shifting, and most pothole riddled roads of America and it does NOT spill when used correctly. The trick is to make sure you fill it up slightly less than the fill line (1 liter), and snug the cap on very tightly. I have found the only time it leaks is from the seal on the lid when I don't tighten it properly.<br /><br />My dog loves this dish. I don't know why exactly but he favors it more than his regular water bowl. When we go home I have to bring this from the truck because his fancy one at the house just doesn't cut it anymore.<br /><br />Buy it! You won't regret it!
B00BYUENNA|1|Please change the photo of this item on web-site. We are detailer and we are sentimental. Black & yellow and Black & red are very attractive item. But, white pump is not attractive.
B00157TGXY|5|Nice odor...I have used this product in the past with no problems.  Appears to control waste tank odor just fine.
B000C42RPK|5|Great for my 91 4runner sr5
B005G5RPL6|5|I orderd the helmet. put it on. Its light weight and very comfortable. will have to buy a second one since the price is low enough. great quality in the craftmenship. will order from the seller again
B000GS1F14|4|After a year and half of use I can say the chrome its not the best, it already started chipping at the bottom, they sound better that the original pipes but not as loud as I expected. I guess its because its a Honda and not a Harley
B00UEMH5L6|5|Looks great and very easy to install!
B00HVGG95Q|5|this is a great cushion
B00GZITV92|1|Only works with high beams on. No brighter than stock bulbs. So disappointed. If I needed something else they should have noted.
B000CKTJZU|5|Good
B000E9Z49Y|5|This is a good cleaner. This stuff gets my windows clean, & cleans all my touch screen devices nicely as well. Cuts through the grime with ease. Just remember to use a good quality microfiber towel(s). No heavy spraying needed, no soaking needed, it's safe on tinted windows, safe on electronic surfaces, no streaking, cheap in price & it does what it says it does. Only wish it was widely available in stores.
B00DV8362W|5|It looks great on my new SUV. It met my expectations and more. I recommend them highly. It came to me in a timely manner. Couldn't have asked for better service. Thank you!!!!!!
B004AQSFZW|5|Great!
B00MWNZ51C|3|The clip mechanism is pretty cheap, and I've had 2 out of 4 break on me already.  They do a better job of clearing the windshield than cheaper ones, but they don't seem to continue to do so for very long.<br /><br />When I first installed these on our cars, they were great.  They did a really good job of clearing the windshield, and had no issues with snow which usually cause most wipers to fail.  Over time however the cheap plastic clip mechanism broke on 2 of these, and after a while they seemed to lose a bit of rigidity causing them to streak.  The difference with these and traditional wipers is that when these streak there are broad swatches of the windshield which aren't cleared, rather than smaller streaks.<br /><br />I've used the more expensive ICON wipers and found them to be far superior to these Insights.  Of course they are significantly more expensive, and it is hard to justify over $20 for a single wiper blade.
B00BHGXPY4|5|First of all, I'm an electrical engineer and I needed to replace the plug on my 3 horse Exiss 5th wheel trailer.  The problem with many of the replacement plugs out there is the size.  Although they might wire up correctly, they won't fit in the access hole in the trailer and you'll end up having it either stick out or more dangerously dangle as you're traveling down the road.  This one fits inside the access hole with the ability to close the access hatch to the hole without a problem.<br /><br />The 2nd issue is how the 10 gauge wire hooks to the internal lugs.  This one uses a screw that tightens a clamp around the stripped wire, it is not a friction connection, which is what you want.<br /><br />The 3rd issue is the strain relief around the insulated cable at the entrance to the plug.  You want to strip the cable so that the strain relief clamps around the insulation on the cable, and not on the individual insulated wires.  This one gives plenty of room to do so and has an excellent positive clamp so that the cable remains snug while not stressing the individual wires in the cable.<br /><br />Finally, the fasteners were of high quality and I torqued them down good without noticing any stripping of the threads or the phillips ends of the screws.  This was an overall excellent experience and I anticipate it to last a long time.  I considered the following items (below) as well, settling on this as it was what I believe the best value:<br /><br />*  Voltec 16-00-580 30 Amp Male Replacement Head<br />*  Progressive Tt-30P 30 Amp Male Rep Plug<br />*  Arcon 18203 30-Amp Replacement Generator Power Plug
B00L6K79ZM|5|perfect decals - they add +10 hp.
B000BPLNXC|5|bought this for my lady, she loves it, lives in the south, but had the chance to use it recently, and worked as advertised.
B001U7E030|5|Perfect fit as replacement steps when I needed to replace the original one on my camper due to it being damaged.
B0028OV6WW|5|I received four miles per gallon in a previous car after putting QMI Oil and QMI transmission treatment in my truck.
B00BQWQN8E|2|# Update # The first bulb of this pair burnt out Sept 29, so about 10 months was the life span. My drive time is around 12hrs/ week, A loss estimate is they lasted under 550hrs considering minimal weekend driving.  They get 2 stars; I assumed I was buying a new, unopened set of bulbs. First, noticing scotch tape on the top, I think nothing of it. Simply assumed it was there to tape back the tap used for store display. I cut the tape and the container completely fell apart in my hands spilling the package and its contents (my new bulbs) on the floor. Leaving me with the cardboard and a peice of clear plastic in hand. Lucky for me the bulbs were still secured in the package. Further inspection shows the box was open and damaged. Thank God no broken bulbs, but will they work? I installed the bulbs because I need them, I do mostly night driving, and cannot wait for replacement or I would return them. They do work and hopefully for a long time despite how it all started.  They are very impressive, very bright! I'm extremely pleased with them. They certainly deserve a higher rating but to the fault of the vender that sold them to me or poor manufacturing of the container they arrived in, I'm sorry they get a 2 stars.
B00KTIYXLU|5|The best!
B006MXEHHG|4|Wasn't an exact fit. I think I was sent a sending unit for a pick up truck not a gmc jimmy. The plug in to the fuel pump side was not correct and the wires were a little long. I was however able to separate the wires from plastic ends and install them into original connectors from vehicle . I also zip tied the extra length of wires so they would not interfere with the module assembly once it was installed in tank. The resistor arm has the correct OHMS so that the gauge in dash reads correctly. Even though I had to make it (fit) I'm very pleased. Sure beats $175.00 for a complete fuel pump module assembly from parts store. Have had no problems to date with gas gauge or daughter running out of gas due to inaccurate gauge readings.
B009LRUJOU|5|Loving it like new from the dealer, easy to install see video on YouTube
B009FNX4OC|4|These steps are very nice but a little over priced. Makes my 2013 Ram 1500 quad look awesome.
B00K7938O4|3|OK...seams to be rather on the 'thin' side. Could be thicker by extra .03-.06”
B000EDUTWC|5|Every camper place I looked, this item was no less than twice the price. And it is the very same thing.
B00BD6P6OU|4|The Rupes LHR 21 really works good. THE REASON WHY I GAVE IT 4 STARS AND NOT 5 IS BECAUSE::<br />When I first used this machine and begin using it, I started out with the blue pad @ speed 6 I had buffed half of the car and noticed the pad began to separate from the back and the longer you use it the more prone it was to separating and even braking into pieces. I couldn't believe it and understand why. So I switched to the green pad and went down to speed 3 thinking the speed was causing the pad to break. After 30mins buffing with  the green pad I started noticing the pad was just starting to break very very lightly.. So I was unable to finish detailing the car for fear all the pads were defective. So the next day immediately called customer service to inform them of the issues I was having. I sent pictures to them and I was told the pads arent defective it was that the pads heat up and i need to rotate them to keep them from heating up or this is what happens. So they are saying that each section you do you need to switch to the next color or another pad to keep the pads from heating up. That would take me all day to do one car. So I asked them &#34;so you are saying that your pads are only good for sections at a time and cant even do a whole car at once? They said yes and I was told if I was going to do it that way that multiple pads would need to be used in order to do the whole vehicle and it didn't matter what pads you used weather they were foam pads or Microfiber pads it would do the same thing.  For me that was sad, so I complained and they replaced the two pads for me for free but it still didn't get me to understand why the pads tear like that.<br />SO AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I FOUND OUT WHY ON A FORUM.  HERES WHAT I FOUND OUT FROM A DETAIL SHOP IN THERE WORDS.<br />&#34;We use the Rupes EXTENSIVELY in our shop.  Here's why it does that:<br /><br />1) On curvy panels - The throw of the LHR21 is so massive, that it creates a different kind of force in the way that it works a panel.  And when you're working on the higher speeds (primarily 5 & 6), that force will separate the pad from its backing.  The reason for this is because it's not making full contact with the body panel, and the throw of the machine is yanking itself away from the pad.  On slower speeds, it won't do this as aggressively.<br /><br />2) On smaller panels than the size of the pad - Same thing. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The LHR21 will do this all day long.  It's truly designed for bigger, flatter panels.  Once this is understood, you'll find you won't have this issue anymore.  There's a lot of &#34;nay-sayers&#34; about the Rupes, but it's because those people don't truly understand the machine, and haven't logged any time in trying to learn its power curve.  However it's a good reason why the Flex AND Rupes, make sense to have both in your arsenal.  We just bought the new Rupes LHR12 Duetto for this reason also.  And we are in love with it.  If you're truly passionate, and love the craft of detailing, it's incredibly smart to have separate polishers, for separate jobs:<br /><br />3&#34; polisher - 5&#34; polisher - 6&#34; polisher<br /><br />The Rupes LHR21 is an incredibly phenomenal machine (It's my personal favorite), but it has its place.  Hope this helps. way that it works a panel.  And when you're working on the higher speeds (primarily 5 & 6), that force will separate the pad from its backing.  The reason for this is because it's not making full contact with the body panel, and the throw of the machine is yanking itself away from the pad.  On slower speeds, it won't do this as aggressively.<br /><br />2) On smaller panels than the size of the pad - Same thing. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The LHR21 will do this all day long.  It's truly designed for bigger, flatter panels.  Once this is understood, you'll find you won't have this issue anymore.  There's a lot of &#34;nay-sayers&#34; about the Rupes, but it's because those people don't truly understand the machine, and haven't logged any time in trying to learn its power curve.  However it's a good reason why the Flex AND Rupes, make sense to have both in your arsenal.  We just bought the new Rupes LHR12 Duetto for this reason also.  And we are in love with it.  If you're truly passionate, and love the craft of detailing, it's incredibly smart to have separate polishers, for separate jobs:<br /><br />3&#34; polisher - 5&#34; polisher - 6&#34; polisher<br /><br />The Rupes LHR21 is an incredibly phenomenal machine (It's my personal favorite), but it has its place.  Hope this helps.

B007EES23M|5|Very nice Army Vietnam Veteran license plate, my husband served in Vietnam and he loves this plate.
B0013ETOC2|4|I had to grind down the welds on the shovel attachment as other reviewers have stated. Nothing major and the Dremel knocked it out in short order. The hoe attachment went on without issue. The real issue is that the shovel is basically flat and the business end has no edge so that has to be ground down much more than the weld. Once you do that you have to repaint it so it doesn't rust. Basically a cool idea but poorly designed. I don't know if the Hi-lift version is better but it has a premium price!
B005N53AM2|3|I've left my cover outside for a week and it still smells and when I put my hands on it the smell stays on my hands. I hope the smell goes away, I don't like the idea of these chemicals just staying on my hands.

B001544VUK|5|What can I say about a timken bearing.  Made in america for the most part.  Not a chinese copy that would fail soon.<br />It is too bad my local bearing house could not get this bearing for a week. Amazon had it to me in 2 days.<br />This bearing is a thrust bearing on a 20 ton crane block. After 33 years it wore out.

B000182DPG|5|My G coupe needed an intake air flow replacement pretty badly after I purchased it (despite the fact I purchased it with only 37k miles) and I already knew about the K&N air filters and I like how it's a one-time purchase deal, no need to buy again when it's filthy.<br /><br />bought the filter, slapped it on, and it has been working flawlessly for a little over 2 weeks now. I combined the K&N air filter with the popular Z-tube mainly because I was already going to be in there so I figured why not just add the Z-tube for a bit more efficiency. at this point, I have no complaints, I do feel a slight increase in power in 2nd and 3rd (not a 100% sure if it's all from the air filter or with the Z-tube), and rev noise has stayed the same.
B001BCM39C|1|Power adjustment doesn't work well.  Just have to hand adjust it and leave it alone. But looks good and will serve it's purpose of a mirror.
B000BQR100|3|~ Sizing<br />I highly recommend just going out to your car and measuring the windshield, because the terms small, medium, large for these products don't coincide with compact, sedan and SUV.<br /><br />~ Rear view mirror<br />Unfortunetly with a new car I didn't notice that the rear view mirror attaches directly to the windshield and not the roof, so it doesn't really fit right.  Ugh!  I may have to buy the pricey customized version, since these don't work to accomodate that feature.<br /><br />Otherwise it seems like a decent product for a car, although I do prefer the old circle version better, since it's easier to get in the windshield.
B00586LIKM|4|The roof racks took me about 20 min to install the first time, and only about 10 minutes on/off after that. I give it 3.5 - 4 stars because they work great as long as you leave them on permanently or lightly lube them periodically(off the car). I have had trouble with the screws and locks getting seizing after a month or so. All racks of this design hum a bit, there are things you can do to lessen this. But even if you bought a $2000.00 rack with the same design it would make the same noise. I have been using these for our roof cargo/luggage holder on long family trips (6-18 hours). It works great and definitely holds the weight they rate it for.
B0060KKYRS|5|The mirror fit perfectly over the old one.  I am pleased with it.
B000GZDSZ8|5|Great product, The installation was straight forward and it fits my 2007 ninja 250 perfectly. I installed this at the same time as I installed some new brake pads, so there were a few miles were it actually felt worse than before due to the pads needing to wear into the groves on the rotor, in order to achieve more surface contact. The result was a steady increase in brake feel and strength over the next 30 or so miles. Afterwards, the improvement is pretty noticeable during hard breaking. With the new lines it feels as if I have more feel and control while breaking on the edge of the bike's abilities.
B0068FZY8O|5|This lock in ride attachment is a great addition to my ATV.  Not sure just yet if I will carry my rifle because of fear of bumping my scope off sight but definately perfect for my shotgun.
B000ALJYEW|5|This is a great product- well engineered, easy to mount and works great. Mirror itself is mounted on a pivot and tilts in any direction as needed. Every car needs this to see blind spots.<br /><br />Feb 2013- Wanted to add the fact that the mirrors are still clear and sharp without discoloration. Clean them with windex and a very fine optical quality wiper.<br /><br />I have also found a side-benefit of these mirrors. At night when the regular side-rear-view mirrors reflect very bright headlights into your eyes, especally during highway driving, I tilt up the regular mirrors and use these wide-angle mirrors to help me see cars approaching me from behind. Makes night-time driving painless and still secure and helps to maintain good night vision. Always be aware that vehicles are closer than they appear in the mirror.<br /><br />Jan 2017- Still in excellent condition. Mirror surface clear from edge to edge without any corrosion.
B003K3J9SI|5|Excellent rotors so far. Brakes really bite when braking firmly.

B00262MTP4|5|The first one was broken but it was exchanged quickly.<br />Not exactly like the OEM but works well. Just make sure to open the box right when you receive it and make sure the fans aren't broken free from the housing. It's definitely worth the cash compared to $200 or $300 from the stealership.
B0068C65BW|5|The Yana Shiki fairing fit great and arrived in great condition.  Keep in mind that it will show up unpainted with minor marks but is ready for prep and paint.

B00BCIHV88|4|Like them a lot<br />Thx<br />d
B000SL4AA2|2|With gas stations charging for air I opted to by this device to maintain tire pressure and fuel economy.  If you buy this gadget  be patient with it.  Trying to pump an auto tire from 31 to 35 psi takes about five minutes.  This would not be bad except that you are not supposed to run the device for more than 15 minutes at a time or you can damage it.  I am lucky to have an indoor garage to work in.  I can imagine what it might be like to try to use this outdoors in the winter.  It does what it claims to do, but is very slow to do it.
B001QVA4TY|5|ITEM WAS FIRST RATE AND GREAT PRICE. NOT EASY TO INSTALL YOURSELF WITH OUT PROPER TOOLS AND ON THIS MODEL TRUCK HARD TO GET TO. FINALLY GOT ITEM ON AND VERY PLEASED WITH PRODUCT.
B004VANLV0|1|I knew this first aid kit didn't come with a lot but I liked that it came in a dry bag and I just wanted something small for backpacking that I could add a few things to.<br /><br />You can't add anything to this absurdly tiny bag.<br />Bag fits in the palm of your hand. I had imagined it twice as big.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend this.
B0065LTR98|1|Its too stiff, and not supple enough for vinyl applications on paintwork. The edges are too sharp, and its quite small for holding in your hand.
B00995LDN0|5|I Got this as a birthday gift for a friend who just purchased a BMW. Loved it!!!!<br />If you're a BMW owner ... It adds a nice touch and  you should have one of these
B003ZWAYW4|1|Great look, love Clint Eastwood, however it was difficult to apply, it was cut to where there was nothing to grab onto but the sticker itself, started coming off after 24 hours
B001SIM470|3|Not bad for the price but if youre not careful it will break fairly easily. mine had a short life to say the least.
B003JCI4PY|4|I ordered 2 of these to replace my beat up original remote. They look like the originals and seem to be well constructed. They are very easy to setup, but one of the remotes did not work well (had to be close to the car and sometimes it wouldn't work at all). Sent the unit back and got a replacement that worked OK. The seller is hard to reach over the phone but they are responsive over email. For the price definitely worth it.
B0002STR90|4|Great product will recommend to buy again
B007W49HMO|4|BEST MADE SYSTEM FOR THE FRONTIER. HAS FAULTS AS EVERYTHING DOES. BAD DESIGN ON THE EXHAUST WITH 3&#34; STEP DOWN FROM MUFFLER TO 2.5&#34; TAILPIPE. CLAMPS HAVE WEAK BOLTS & DON'T TIGHTEN ENOUGH TO SEAL. CHROME QUALITY IS QUESTIONABLE ON TAILPIPE. MUFFLER IS LOUDER, DUE TO STRAIGHT THROUGH DESIGN. THICK MATERIAL, SO EXHAUST, ESPECIALLY MUFFLER IS HEAVIER THAN FACTORY. COATING MATERIAL SMELLS LIKE ANTIFREEZE & APPEARS TO HAVE A WHITE SUBSTANCE INSIDE OF TIP SCREEN LAYERS. SMELLED LIKE EVERY SHOP CHEMICAL FIRST DAY WHILE BURNING OFF. STILL SLIGHT SMELL AFTER SECOND DAY.<br /><br />NOW THE POSITIVES, WHY I CHOSE THIS EXHAUST.<br /><br />ALL STAINLESS, DUAL INLET PIPES, THICK GAUGE,  BAYONET STYLE WELDED HANGERS, FACTORY MOUNT LOCATIONS, OVAL DESIGN, SMOOTH PIPE FLOW.<br /><br />COULD BE IMPROVED, BUT NOT COMPARED WITH OTHERS.
B000C2EDSQ|5|Good
B000CIV4KA|1|It was a broken secondhand tool covered in grease! Totally dissatisfied!!!!!
B00CFNGRPM|5|These fit just right on my middle van seats and there were exactly as what I wanted and came quickly.
B00T5BDMO6|5|Perfect fit on 2015 Focus ST.  Function great and look great!
B00DD1646M|5|Fast delivery and quality A+++
B001NZO8YU|5|Works perfectly. Easy to install on my 2012 Fiesta, saved a lot of money.  Update: Unfortunately the first one burnt out - they sent another - installed and works great! Thanks
B001UJB8X8|5|Great product will order MORE!!!!!!!😀
B00I1BTB4Q|5|I installed this on my 95 ZX6R about 700 miles ago and haven't had any problems with it. This chain is priced significantly lower than most others I saw, which made me a little nervous. After using it, I must say that it seems to be of equal quality as my old chain and doesn't appear cheap in any way. I have only had to tighten it once since I put it on and it hasn't stretched at all since.
B00PKJFYW0|5|Love love loveeee this decal!!! I got it way before it said I would and i placed it on my car today. I am beyond happy! Went on perfect the first try! They even sent a 2nd one for free for the first one to be your test try! So happy with this purchase!
B000CF6RX2|4|Fit nice, look good and very easy to install without any tools needed only taking about 5-10 mins for all four.
B000EJV5II|2|Worked great but broke in less than a year.  I didn't even use it that much.  Fan still runs, but display and other lights don't work.
B00U05XVOC|4|Just received.  Well made.  Of steel and very sturdy
B000CBDDQK|5|Convenient and reliable
B000O5WL76|5|Why have a $20K Harley and a $10 cheapo toolkit.  This kit has everything you need.  It's a little heavy and pricey but it gives you peace of mind, and it works.  Good investment for the long run.
B002M4CBLS|5|They are perfect just as the day I bought my car new 5 years ago.  They are so bright people think I have my high beams on. FYI I drive a 2007 Saturn Ion Quad Coupe Redline so you know that these headlights are very specific to the car
B002OK0BHQ|1|Discretion said it fit my bike and it didn't. Don't buy!!
B0029XK1WI|5|It's a nice look on my car. My dad is a veteran and I'm a supporter of any body tht serves the country. And if u font want the red sticker.  I say this one is more distinctive and a regular person wouldn't know Wat semper fedelis actually ment if they seem it on ur car but a cop would
B006GLEBIO|1|Did not light up at ALL. Disappointed. Where is the option for ZERO STARS? I am now inconvenienced and have to send them back. Waste of time, waste of money. All these people did was piss me off.
B002P8QKAY|5|Wonderful product.  Great price.  Fast fast delivery.  5 stars definitely.  THANK YOU
B009MASZQU|4|I like the sun shade. It's made with good material unlike the ones they sell at walmart or auto zone. it covers the entire windshield and block the heat and looks great from the outside.  the only con i have is the ends of the shade tend to roll and show a little sun, but i think that is due to being rolled up. otherwise it;s a good product.
B007BKQSVC|5|Now I get all the girls
B000CINVA6|5|CRC makes great products,  why else would I buy from them?<br /><br />VERY handy for lubing the gear set on the sheet winches.
B009AD8WJE|4|not bad
B001NYP6VU|5|Fit in my 2006 mazda tribute.
B000EVYGZA|5|This is by far one of the best multimeters for the price.  This is definitely not a fluke meter but at the same time I got this multimeter for less than $20.  The cheapest multimeter I could find at my local electronics store was $35 and it wasn't even a auto-ranging meter.  The cheapest multimeter at radioshack had horrible reviews.
B00BLZ8R6W|5|this is Okay.
B00421KMBA|4|Quality made, very durable. The color was true to the photo. I did not install, but my husband had no problems. Would definitely recommend to construction workers looking to keep their trucks seats looking new. For anyone who doesn't read the description, just wanted to point out, there is not a cover for the arm rest included.
B00KU1GODG|2|. Item did not come with drivers. Item did not come with software. After extensive searches on the internet. I found drivers and software, but the item said there were 'No stored malfunctions', even when the &#34;check engine&#34; light was lit. Don't wast your time or money on this.  Finally found some drivers and software that worked, pain in the butt. 2 stars.
B003D4K9TC|5|great deal
B00JBI9DK0|5|They look amazing
B000X2IUKM|4|The cushion does the job but requires some shifting around to be properly placed.  It is sturdy and I expect it to last many years.
B008T8CXGY|5|This stuff is absolutely wonderful.  In fact it does everything they say it does.  Once you become familiar with how it behaves in different applications you will recognize the characteristic silky-smoothness it imparts.  Drawer glides feel like ice skates on ice.  Your pocketknife will &#34;walk and talk.&#34;  You get the picture.  Remember it is also a fantastic penetrating oil, stops rust dead in it's tracks as well.  I definitely recommend buying some.
B0030I5X2O|5|I have used the Rudolph nose and antlers for many years now. Every Thanksgiving I put them on my Suburban and call it Rudolph the Red Nosed Suburban. This year I decided to purchase the Star and Trees. They have been just as great as the nose and antlers! I'm thinking of getting the Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day and 4th of July decorations too! They are certainly a conversation starter and a head turner. Kids love to point at the vehicle saying &#34;Look! Look!&#34; Every day I see a child pointing and looking at our vehicle. It's one of the best things I have every purchased for my vehicle. I recommend that everyone has one and then the novelty will wear off!
B0012WTYHU|4|It's a good product and I received it on time
B001XVEZYC|5|Finally I have found a set of LED's that fit the tag lights on my Scion tC. They look awesome, but I wonder if they might be considered a little too bright for Johnny Law? They really light up the road around my bumper! I'm a very happy customer.
B001SGXA84|5|I need a shock to the left and to the right information that appears in this price
B00020CAVA|5|Exact product and fast shipping
B00G4T6816|5|Very nice bed for our RV. We have been staying up north in our RV for the last 4 months. This mattress makes it even nicer!
B0081K300I|4|We use these on our concession trailer and for the money it's a very good deal  ez install has plug ready  we are oading 2 more
B00QUU7X54|5|Gonna look even better on my Car! Love the sticker! Great quality!! Exactly what they say it'll be. I love my sticker! I am so happy! thanks guys &#60;3
B00IAC2MHY|1|I got this for my husbands truck it tore up when he tried to put it on. I will not buy this one again
B000IYYFBS|3|Nowhere in the description does it mention this is for the LEFT (DRIVER) side only.  Good product, but you will also need the right side kit.
B0041TUA1A|4|This mirror came fast and looked great.  Installation was simple.  I would have given 5 stars but the item was not packed very well, although no damage was noted.
B000JFN9WC|5|Boy, I wish I bought this 25 years ago.  Please do not do manual brake pumping to bleed brakes--what a pain!  This is a high quality product.  Very nice premium fittings.  An adjustable 'throttle' to regulate the bleed rate and the amount of air drawn from your compressor.  I was pleasantly surprised by the accessories.  It includes a hanger to suspend the device if needed, it includes an extra screw down base if you want to create a platform to mount it, a separate siphon tube is included as well as extra fittings to fit over bleeder nipples.<br /><br />This makes brake bleeding a breeze.  Like the instructions recommend, I applied a thick silicone dielectric grease to the nipple threads to prevent air from being pulled in around the bleeder screw (it makes the Mityvac more effective).  The front calipers bleed out pretty quickly (1 to 3 minutes), rear calipers take longer due to the longer path length and associated pressure drop (5 to 10 minutes).<br /><br />This tool makes brake bleeding an easy one man job.  I did a Toyota Avalon, Honda Odyssey, and Land Cruiser without ever having to go back and re-bleed due to a spongy pedal.  I wish I would have spent the $130 a long time ago.  Make sure you have an air compressor that can keep up with it.  You won't regret the purchase.  It's nice to see that tech. support is in Cleveland, Ohio if you need it.  This is a heavy duty product that is engineered to last.
B000C13U7W|5|Installation went as expected and the unit works great.  Thank God for 1AAuto.com and their videos on YouTube!  They and doing it myself saved me hundreds of dollars since all four of my power windows had died!
B005HF3BWW|5|This fit with my E-Z pass to use in VA & MD toll road. Look strong, feel strong. Sucking cup is holding very strong. Dont' know what will happen after one year. Work at toll plaza without a problem. Most of all, this produce was made in U.S.A. Not cheap stuff from China. Good product. Metal frame will not melt or re-form due to heat or cold.
B001QK1X5O|5|won't stop a dedicated trailer thief, but it will stop that guy who keeps walking over to the trailer to &#34;see how great it is&#34; and flips the latch, forgetting it's still locked ;)
B000N5UVME|4|fit and finish is clean with a universal bracket.  I haven't installed yet but expect they will be loud on a bike
B00A0GUSQK|3|One of the antennas showed up broken. The seller replaced them and when I was mounting them, the same one ended up breaking. Oh well. You get what you pay for.
B009LR5DU0|3|Pretty nice license plate. Works and looks as expected. Wish \\"Lakeland Terrier\\" was on the bottom in larger letters. I think it is overpriced for what you get (not too many choices tho...)
B0081KM69E|4|Does its job for the price didn't take too long to get to my door and right on the box and plugged them in is ready to go
B001872BZ6|5|I've had a broken Driver side door handle (2000 Chevy Prizm - Tan color) for nearly a year and just got around to replacing it. I chose this item because it had reviews. The product was as described. It is not the exact color as the original but close enough; the original was smooth looking and the one I received looked like it had grooves and was slightly lighter in color. The spring was good, very easy to install. Overall a perfectly sufficient replacement handle. Seller shipped the product the very next day and I received it very promptly. I would buy again without hesitation.
B00AJVSBDI|4|it works
B006X8CXT4|5|Great price and fast delivery. Easy install but the whole bumper had to come off
B009FNWHTU|5|Purchased these for my husband for his 2010 Silverado for Christmas. They came in black which is fine because that is the color of his truck.  He installed them easily and quickly wIth the help of his brother.  He has not complained and every time we are in the truck together and love being able to use them instead of stepping all the way up.  He is still telling me I got him an awesome present.
B000CONUJM|4|I am not a service professional or even a serious handyman, so maybe the size is par for the course, but I was expecting something closer to the pocket gauges one typically sees. Given the range of pressure and the accuracy / precision that they are shooting for it may be that this length is necessary, I just want to give folks a heads up.<br /><br />The description gives the size as &#34;16 x 4.8 x 0.8 inches&#34;.<br />I have not measured it but 16 inches is probably close for the length, I have no idea what the 4.8 inches refers to.<br />I bought this in large part because of a comment by Click and Clack that the cheapo gauges are not all that accurate.<br />I would prefer to give a review without a rating but ... for me 5 stars is perfection, 4 stars is good stuff, 3 is working.  I am generally taking the word of the other reviewers that it works well, if it gives me problems in the future I'll redo the rating.
B001GDJGJQ|5|This works perfect on my passenger seat for my commute car. I don't have a center console and lack storage space. I want to keep items nearby on my commute to work and this does the trick nicely.
B000HUILKY|4|Perfect for my 1967 Ford 289's stock stamped oil pan. Always double-check the parts application on Fel-Pro's website: http://fme-cat.com/application.aspx
B00B1XROWW|5|Great shirt, very pleased. Thanks
B00TEFRKQO|5|Only one trip so far - but love them - Each got our own space :) and they did hold more than enough for a 4 day vacation!!
B008Y2RYHS|5|I ordered this to go on the back of my RV to show my pride for Game Of Thrones/ A Song Of Ice And Fire. It came pretty quickly, well packaged, and as described. It looks exactly like the picture. Great stuff!
B000C7XPLM|5|SMP produts are some of the best in the industry ( besides AC Delco )  Quality and workmanship is always excellent  I have never had a problem in the past 25 years that i have been using SMP parts while working on my own cars, they outlast all the others by at least 5 to 7 years  THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY
B002OPKRL6|5|I am a big fan of these (Emgo).  I have bought a pair for each of my motorcycles and they hold up great !  After many falls on my 2005 Honda 450X and my GF 2006 230F, they have protected the levers and our hands everytime without fail. The plastic is heavy duty and can take a good beating too.  Plus, they are priced much lower than the identical name brands.
B006M4AOCC|5|These fit perfectly in my 2010 corolla. I would recommend leaving them out of the shipping plastic for a day or so to prevent the strong odor of new rubber inside your car. I like the look of these mats with corolla logo.
B00B9IPF52|5|works fine fit fine .  Purchased for a dress up of vehicle.  Bolted right on all hardware worked.  seems like good quality
B000COL4A4|5|this tailgate gasket system works just fine for what i intended it to do which is keep water out dust out of the back of my pickup truck with a cap on it. cant go wrong with this gasket setup
B001J89BHU|5|Brought as a gift for my sister for her new car, she was very excited about the design.  She couldn't wait to put them to use.
B000701HF0|5|Great price and Amazon Prime make this a no brainer, the new camping season is about on top of us and just wanted to make sure that my hot water heater was protected. We'll know at the end of the season when I pull it out to flush the tank and see how much the rod has taken care of the insides.
B00IUPMA8W|5|These fit my bike as if it came from the factory
B000EW0KHW|3|This little gem assisted me with the diagnostics of my 96 Ford car. Before I bought this unit I was replacing parts to beat the band and got no further ahead with the exception of having lots of new unnecessary expensive replacement parts. After reading the instructions for 30 minutes and a 10 minute test, zeroing in on the trouble was now possible and the frustrating guesswork virtually over with.
B003XWLJUM|5|I just received my cover and I have to say it is built really well and fits my 40hp johnson pretty good.
B005GHB5U6|4|I really like this mask, but it scares people if you forget it is on and enter a place. It keeps your face warm and does not obstruct vision.
B00IPUB0ZG|3|Not quite what I expected.But you get what you pay for😯
B009M0S4U2|4|The  seat covers in my 2011 Chevrolet are of a black fabric that soils easily and is hard to clean. I was attracted to these protectors because they can easily be put on or taken off as desired, and I am pleased with them in that regard. They appear to be very durable, they are of a heavy fabric that does not move around, and they are comfortable. These covers do a good, but not perfect job of keeping my seats clean.  The only problem I have with them is that when I get into my four wheel drive truck I have to step up into the truck and tend to drag the corner of the cover as I do, thus exposing the seat that I wanted to protect.  It's a small thing, probably fairly easy to work around, and won't happen to everyone, but I feel that if the cover were a bit more generous in the overhang I might not have any problem at all.  So for me they are not perfect, but nonetheless very good and I'm glad I bought them.
B007H2PU5O|5|I put these in my pop-up camper to replace a standard bulb that died in less than 6 months.  These are equally as bright as the bulbs I replaced (if not brighter) and are cool to the touch after staying on for 60+ minutes.  With the old bulbs, my ceiling fan would audibly slow when I turned the light on - with this there is no slowing, the power draw is so low.  I will be buying more to replace the other bulbs come spring.
B0009IK5T4|5|don't waste your money on more expensive wipers. i got these to replace my rainx lattitudes and i honestly like them better. been through about 6 thunderstorms since getting these and they push the water right off the windshield. and i don't hear any squeaking at all
B0052SF0LO|5|These are bright, reliable, and hold up remarkably well in the our Florida weather.
B004TM93CQ|1|wears out quickly and i have to clean black dust off of rims weekly !
B0054TQY70|1|I purchased the Delphi FG0849 for my 2005 Ford Taurus.  I installed it and could hear it run, but it did not pump any fuel.  It was very noisy also.  I returned it to Amazon as a defective item.  Thank goodness for the A to Z guarantee.  I then bought a Motorcraft PFS344, which did work.  The car is running fine now with the Motorcraft fuel pump.
B002UZZMII|3|I was happy to find this replacement switch when I was in a pinch fixing my electric winch.  I wish I had purchased a backup at the time because the lever on this switch is plastic and it seems to flex - so either that is to keep it from breaking or it is just a matter of time before it snaps off in my hands.  I'm hoping it is not the latter.
B006P2PYJO|5|Keeps all mud off the doors of jk! Why do I have to put all these space taking extra words???
B001HZNK04|4|The tether could stand to be an inch or so longer.  Other than that, it works well.
B000CO7BQK|3|As a D-I-Yer, I'm not sure I installed these right. There were no instructions and not everybody buying these is a pro or has manuals. A one page sheet showing some line drawings of a typical installation would be a plus.
B001B0TCN4|1|Did not work
B005N6Z2W2|5|Good quality, perfect fit
B00BJQMY4E|1|These are no better then the stock bulbs.<br />The only difference is they have a blue tip that doesn't show up when &#34;on&#34;<br />They aren't any brighter.<br />I only hope they last longer than one season.
B00HNXES00|5|This frame is high quality and very detailed.  Looks pretty perfect on the car!  Thanks for making the frame for us!
B003JIEWF4|5|Exactly what I needed
B000BUV1RK|5|I purchased a wave 3 to replace the forced air heater in my pickup camper. The fan in the old heater was noisy and ran the battery down quickly. Used this heater last weekend at hunting camp. Ran it for two days solid on low and it kept my camper very comfortable with tempuratures in the 30's at night and had plenty of propane in the 5 gallon tank to cook with more than expected left over. Install it according to instructions for clearance and ventillation and it will work great. I would highly recommend this heater if you like to camp away from the campground with the RV hookup!
B001XCBCQK|4|We have a Bull terrier that likes to ride up in the front if she could. This partition seems to do the job. It is used in my FJ Cruiser. It assembles easy enough and installation is simple. I have had to make adjustments multiple times. Initially she would stick her nose between the two cross bars in an attempt to get out which would tilt the contraption to one side. So I closed the distance between the cross bars which seemed to help. The only thing that keeps this in place is pressure and friction, be prepared to make adjustments.
B001UR5XCW|5|This portable luggage scale is very easy to use, light to carry and works very well!<br />It has been very usefull!
B00EZWQONG|5|Thank you the item is great!
B002BG4WX2|1|This didn't work the first time, the second time, and the third time.  Two trips to our favorite garage and one application at home never made the a/c work for our daughter's Pontiac.  Moot point now that summer is ending.
B0002JMF9I|5|Most freon can taps don't mate up with the good gauges sets, so you need an adapter. This addpapter is exactly what you need!
B006TR036E|1|Didn't fit my seats and is a hassle to return...waste of my money :(<br />I loved the steering wheel cover!
B002TTOI08|5|AAA+++
B009OPZCXM|5|Just as described, well made, and easy to install.  I have placed it on my hand cycle. I would buy again.
B0028PJ10K|5|Used these on paved site, and they met all of our expectations. Cut plywood pads to put under if used on stone site.
B00029WYVW|4|Haven't needed to use this yet. It seems expensive though for what it is...a detergent and oil???? Oh well.
B005COIJP2|1|The trailer harness is several feet shorter than advertised.  The directions are horrible.  It does not come with sufficient hardware for installing it.  The wiring is about 28 gauge (WAY too light for trailer wiring).  Seriously, this wire is difficult to strip it's so thin.  I installed it & had to modify it to get it to work.  It doesn't work as well as it should (some LEDs don't come on when the left turn signal flashes).  It cost me about an hour extra to dig around for wire nuts & connectors + I had to disregard the directions that were completely misleading to get it to work.  Take my advice: PASS on this one!
B00LW1L82U|5|How do you review a car-wash solution in the Northeastern US in the middle of winter....easy, you spot wash.<br />This product is concentrated and thus it is recommended that every 4oz of this solution be mixed with water for washing.  What we did, to test the product, was use 2oz of the wash and mixed it into a 1 gallon bottle.<br /><br />With snow cover on the ground and salt /calcium chloride on the roads, it is quite difficult to wash a car and have it remain clean....  What I decided to do was wash the hood of one of our cars 3 times with this solution.  We washed, we saw it get dirty, we washed again, and so on...  The end result is that this product is everything it claims to be.  Number one it is a car wash solution that cleans and number 2 it promises to wax and restore the clear coat of the vehicle.<br /><br />The washing process does indeed clean and protect the vehicle with built in 'waxing'.  Once we washed the hood of one of our cars, it was apparent that the wax was working as washing it the second time was easier.  Water and salt/snow/muck residue now seem to slide off of the cars hood and not stick around....much like a good wax job would provide.<br /><br />I cannot speak to the restoration of the clear coat, just yet - the time of year is just not right.  However, since it seems to be working well as a wash/wax product, I have no doubt that it will indeed restore some of the luster on the cars.<br /><br />ps. The car this was tested on is approximately 6 years old and has weathered the NJ area for all of that time.<br /><br />Recommended - 5/5
B000LV9RNY|5|best valeo blades I believe you can get and i bought them during an amazon deal. great quality like oem on the mercedes they come with. would recommend
B000E9TS9G|5|This stuff is awesome. I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this wash, but it is true to it's name. I love this stuff and would recommend it to everyone.    I doubt I will ever use any other car wash again.
B0031HYABE|4|its a generic replace for coil but working good and looks great finished I'm happy
B008HR6HB4|5|- Looks cool<br />- Easy to install<br />- Great price<br />- Works great<br /><br />I love it, and would definitely buy another.
B000XQO0UM|5|Used these on my 1947 ford with Flat head behind a set of Fenton headers.The sound is just what I was looking for, mellow rumble at idle and a nice roar when you get in to it. .Note that the stainless steel is of the magnetic type probably grade 410.
B0055B121U|5|This jumper wiring connects the replacement Emission canister assembly(AC Delco part # 20995472) to your vehicle's wiring for the original part.  It works well, and connects easily to the vehicle's wiring and the canister assembly.<br /><br />Part was as described, and works well.
B000E7YP7I|5|My order arrived promptly and the product was packaged nicely.  I am very pleased with the Rola 59000 organizer.  It is so well made with a rigid base and dividers if you choose to use them.
B000BN3A4Y|1|Firstly, I know that this is not a normal hammer. It's clear from its name that this is only to be used in emergencies. However, I tried it out in a non-emergency setting just to make sure it worked before putting it in my toolbox. I have to say, that for a hammer designed to work in a critical hammer-emergency, it was absolutely terrible at driving a nail through ANYTHING. I tried using the LifeHammer on the entire spectrum of nail sizes, and in every case, the nail was too difficult to hit to adequately push the nail through wood. It was infuriating. As a professional carpenter and woodworking teacher, I still couldn't use the LifeHammer after an hour of practice.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the floss-cutting add-on was really useful and functional.<br /><br />Pros: Water-Resistant. Floss cutter works adequately.<br /><br />Cons: Hammer does not work in ordinary circumstances (note: I did not have an emergency warranting a hammer during my use. Perhaps it works better in extraordinarily high-stress situations.)
B00ABYVT64|4|These are holding cleaning products very well without leaking. It would be nice if the triggers were a little longer--it is fatiguing to use them for more than a few minutes at a stretch. With the pint size, of course, you have to refill them more often than a quart container, but their lighter weight more than offsets this.<br /><br />I would give them five stars, but the stem on one of the bottles has broken after just a few months of use. Fortunately, the break is not far from the bottom, so the bottle is still useable.<br /><br />Not bad for the price.
B00HUVNXWY|4|So far so good. hope this starter don't let us down being on the water is not a good place to break down. But if it dose I will post it.
B0031I1ZIE|4|Kind of thin material but fit the machine we have well & has good elastic at the edges so it stays on even with fairly strong winds.
B0022UHDHY|5|I'd definitely buy more! Fast shipping, and product isn't some cheap Chinese piece of crap! It's actually holding up with daily use!
B0009OMYAQ|5|Works as advertised with a u-joint and 5\\" extension. Perfect little wrench.
B00BHKMR7Q|4|Good price and it fixed my idle problem, no complaint
B0002SQYTG|5|This Milton tire pressure gauge is accurate, and has an easily readable scale for pressures from 5 to 50 psi, which covers the range used for passenger cars , light trucks, riding mowers, etc.  It's surprisingly hard to find a gauge with all of these features, but this gauge has everything I need.
B008MT9IEK|5|It's a plier head cover that fits well.  Difficult to mess up...
B00F4MQJ5O|3|The bar itself is fine but I'm not crazy about the mounting brackets because as is I'm worried about drilling holes into the roof of my truxk. Im going to tweek it a little and cross my fingers that it doesnt leak. Also from the ad i thought it had two modes for the flood and spot light but it doesnt. It would have been nice if it came with a switch but that was not mentioned in the ad so I guess I can't me too mad about that
B00J5947ME|3|My tank, a Honda CB900C, made it very difficult to remove excess anything put in it.  Because it took so long to remove cleaning solutions flash rust was impossible to stop.  And forget about getting excess POR-15 out of this tank. The product doesn't dry (adhere) to the surface of tank unless exposed to air so that you have to keep sealing the tank, roll the POR-15 around, unseal for a bit to let it dry, seal and roll around, etc,etc. With another tank this  product might work great.  As it is, perfectionist that I am, I'm not sure that I have a result that will stand up to years of use.
B0036VRQ70|5|It works! Seems no side effect until now.
B00CI93ZKI|5|Awesome
B007237L00|5|Perfect OEM match for my 2006 Jetta TDI 1.9 BRM.  Fits good and was fairly priced better than the dealer
B0002NYE3O|1|Broke on first use
B00EKPXZVW|4|Good
B0002WRIG0|5|very very very accurate nice product thanks
B00KTIY4ZA|5|Works great!!
B003721CC8|2|Helps diminish the bouncing going on back there (I have both a Curt hitch as well as a Curt bike rack).  But it's fiddly to use, and something that other hitch/rack manufacturers don't mandate.  So while I use it (partially to avoid voiding Curt's warranty), if I had to do it again I might select a different hitch and rack manufacturer--one that doesn't make a bike rack that rattles around in its hitch so much.
B003I5FXQ0|5|This makes waxing your car a piece of cake!<br />I'm very happy with this purchase.It was the correct part.<br />Fast delivery and great product as advertised.<br />I would highly recommend this product and seller!
B00EJF15H4|5|It cool make the car look race looking easy simple to hook up the engraving make it look even more cool and the quality is excellent craftsmanship.
B009IFIETM|5|Instillation was simple and mirror functions like original.
B008GOE7W4|5|Everybody like this when they see in my wheels  a my car, 5 start products
B0002MACJA|3|Kind of weird the holders are too but and don't grip the sides well...
B000E4CODS|3|Given this is a basic side mirror with no lights/electric control, etc. it is good. Arrived quickly, matches my other original mirror. Mirror is perfect.
B00CH6T18C|5|My 5-star review is based on customer service, not necessarily the product.  I ordered the cleaner to try and remove body oil stains from a leather sofa - an admittedly difficult cleaning problem.  I was very excited to receive the product based on the existing reviews, but unfortunately it was unable to clean the stains from my sofa.  I emailed for a refund based on their money-back guarantee and promptly received a response that not only provided me a few additional suggestions on how I might be able to clean it more effectively, but also refunding my money as promised (without requiring me to wait and try the new suggestions first).  I unfortunately cannot try those suggestions since we already sold the sofa as-is, but I am HIGHLY impressed with their customer service and how they stood behind their promise.  A++++ for that - and I promise to try the remainder of the bottle in the future on other leather items as needed and if it is as effective as most reviews say it is then I will definitely return to buy more.
B00K6O33FE|3|Hitch arrived today, 6 days earlier than expected. It was shipped unboxed with just a vinyl bag wire tied to it for the address and paper work. Needless to say it was pretty beat up and requiring repainting. It was purchased to replace a rusted unit with rusted bolts but It came with no bolts. So now a trip to the hardware/ auto parts store is needed. It does match the OEM hitch.  It's not a package,  it just the hitch.
B00519V522|2|I had to return it as the Transponder did not work.<br />Took it to a locksmith who stated there was no transponder present in the key.
B007SOQ7BW|2|Don't waist your money on this one it is super thin and flimsy and cheap looking and not worth the amount that it is being sold for.
B004C69NTC|4|This air filter fits well, does it job filtering out dirt but it didnt do anything at all to help with the air smell like I had thought it would.  I have a 2009 4 door toyota tacoma that is well maintained and kept clean. I guess what I am missing and looking for is that still new car smell.  So in all fairness cant blame the air filter for that.  Did I mention you can find the filter here cheaper then the dealership or the auto part stores ?
B004J0TEWC|5|The link that judges if the part fits works great! I will use Amazon for any parts that I am able to wait a couple of days on, delivery date was even a couple days early, very pleased!
B00144BIC0|5|priced right, excellent fit, looks great, would surely buy them again if needed.  love them on my 2012 Ford f150STX.  GREAT!!!
B001TR2F9M|5|I use to clean my shower, works great.
B004KEJXZA|1|garbage,  i dont  recommend
B008BVZJQU|4|i love these lights, i had in my grille for the longest time, (got pulled over once for them being blue haha)  then i moved them to my lower grille in the bumper to use as fog lights sorta.  the look awesome, love the remote.  the one thing i dislike is the seal on them.  i had them for about 5 or 6 months maybe longer, then it rained like hell, two of the lights got water in them, made one show multi color it was weird.  let it dry and re sealed it and it still works. but check the seals before you put them on.
B005EV95BU|5|easy to install and looks great!
B009X23B2U|5|ok
B0078FZNFM|5|After 51 years of beating myself up and trying to ride a 3 wheeler this is me from start to the end of the day, hope the DNR does not spot me and take the sticker for real, I think I will have to lie to him, hate the DNR anyways , they think they have more power than the DEA wrong, we in MI. know the truth,

B000BPSWFY|5|Good
B000GQ6LF6|5|great product great price and unbelievably fast delivery Way to go CURT. Called it in one day and it was at my place the next
B00FP0LHA2|1|Like other reviewers here I would NOT recommend this product. It simply doesn't work. Frankly, I would give it zero stars if I could.
B008HRZP7Q|5|Incredible quality, value, function, and delivery.  Would definitely buy again!
B00028FB8G|3|jack was what I expected, nothing special, was used to replace a jack that was broken. if you want to buy a jack buy it somewhere else and you dont have to write thes stupid reviews.
B000QE8V7E|4|I like it ,I had hoped it would be bigger but it works well
B0000AXY62|5|Perfect for my Honda pilot.
B00CNEQYF6|4|great
B001QT9KO6|5|stuff works
B000182EWS|5|Perfect, tight fit for my 2002 Chevy Silverado 1500.  Take your time installing and follow the instructions.  Pre-align the autoshade, it's easy to make a mistake, but easy to make it look great if you watch the curve of the shade against the curve of the truck.  You have to work it in behind the the tab on the side mirror, and then level it up.  Great value.  High quality, dark plastic.  Super sticky adhesive side makes for a strong bond.  I installed me in the dead of winter, and it still sealed up great.
B0015PK3AG|5|I looked at the auto parts store for one and couldn't find one. This fits the oil filter housing that has the element inside. I didn't like how toyota changed the location of the filter. My 2005 corolla, I don't even have to jack it up to change the oil but with the 2009 you have to jack up the car. This oil filter wrench make getting it off a breeze.
B00MH4663C|5|This product met and exceeded all of my needs. It was exactly what I wanted and paid for. Shipping was fast and on time. I recomm this to anyone who is looking for a portable charger, it will work wonders
B000JFJLP6|5|By far one of best jump packs for the money buy now an never need another. Techs get now. also good to charge off of.
B00EK5EVQA|1|One light was cracked
B001OMVCN2|5|Works great.  We have had no problems with it and it works great.
B000IYIAE6|5|Have always used this axle manufacturer for my CV axle needs. In my opinion they are the best you can get. Not much more to say.
B001FY48Z8|4|They look good. Some of them were difficult to get on. I tried using the little tool that came with them to pull them back off and it would not work. Tool is too flimsy. I hope when I get rotation done or have to change a tire that they don't brake. Guess I'll find out then. Otherwise they do look really good compared to the rusty lug bolts that are under them.
B002ZTK734|5|Look nice, work well, built well. No bends, cracks, or breaks when my bike was knocked onto the brake side by a truck. I still don't like that guy.
B0031ZDU62|5|Was delivered before they said it would and was the right ones. I would highly recommend this product.
B0017R5EQK|4|There are 3 basic methods for testing a lead-acid battery that I am aware of, using a:<br />1) Digital voltmeter,<br />2) Specific gravity hydrometer (temperature compensating), &<br />3) Quality load tester.<br /><br />There are pros & cons for each method. See following link for more details about lead-acid batteries:<br />[ http://www.batterystuff.com/kb/articles/battery-articles/battery-basics.html ]<br /><br />This Solar BA5 load tester was purchased instead of other testing devices mainly due to its high ratings by other customers, its 100 to 1200 Cold Cranking Amp (CCA) load range, cost factors, & my limited need for testing lead-acid batteries. I also wanted to be able to determine for myself if & when to replace my batteries instead of relying upon the opinions of battery dealers - Their main goal is to sell you a new battery rather than making sure you get the longest life from your current batteries.<br /><br />In general, I am pleased with this battery tester. It gets its power from the battery being tested. The unit is simple to use. And you can select & apply the CCA load based upon the rating for the battery being tested.<br /><br />However, I only gave it 4 stars for the following reasons:<br />1) The Owner Instruction Manual skips over important details concerning what load to select & apply. For example, some battery companies label their batteries with the amp load for testing. This number is normally 1/2 of the CCA rating. The instruction manual makes no reverence of this fact. There isn't any issue when the battery being tested is at or above its rated CCA value. Problem is what to do when the battery tests below its rating. Lead-acid batteries lose their fully charged CCA potential as they age. I used this tester to check my truck battery. My truck is not used during winter, and I need to make sure that its battery is kept charged (so that it doesn't freeze during storage). I could not find on my truck's battery what the manufacturer's recommended test load should be. When I selected an initial test load of 850 CCA (battery's rated CCA), the tester failed the battery (red light only). However, if the initial test load was set to 1/2 of rated CCA, the tester passed the battery (green light only). The tester indicated that the battery's current CCA was 585 to 605 (depending upon what initial CCA test load had been selected. So it is clear that the battery has lost 29 to 31 percent of its initial Cold Cranking Amps (CCA). This battery can still start my truck's engine, but the tester was somewhat ambiguous as to if the battery was good or bad. Thus, more information (& perhaps actual starting tests of truck) is needed before I can determine if my battery can still start my engine after sitting for 1 week or longer.<br />2) Would prefer a tester that came with a storage case.<br />3) Would prefer a tester that had clamp cords that could be plugged into tester, so that they could be replaced as needed.<br /><br />Follow-up<br />Checked with my local Interstate Battery Dealer (which is also a John Deere Dealership) concerning how they load test lead-acid batteries. Was told their standard procedure is to set the test CCA at 1/2 the battery's rated CCA. I was also assured that my battery still had plenty of CCA's needed. And that my battery did not need to be replaced at this time.test load of 850 CCA (battery's rated CCA), the tester failed the battery (red light only).

B00H6XB0NK|5|Came really fast and was just right for my older cat
B0009IQXFO|5|I put four capfuls of this and a gallon of hot water in a five gallon bucket and washed my car. It got it clean. I'm not enough of a car washing expert to know if it is significantly better than anything else.
B0007N5758|5|After searching local stores and not finding what I wanted, I found this one on line. I'm a gardener, so my hands are frequently in the soil. All the other brushes I've tried have had bristles that are too limber to do a good cleaning job. This one is perfect and also one of the least expensive.
B007KPW1D2|5|This is the best product for my Harley. During the winter this device will not overcharge your battery. Others are prone to damage your battery if you do not use them as directed. This one you plug in and forget. BINGO!!!! SOLD ME
B001GJ3FIS|5|Very good ! Fitted perfect in my expectations and gave me extra pleasure in watering my garden. The quality seems very good.
B00D8Y71ZM|4|Great product but overpriced.  Performs as advertised.
B006VIONI0|5|It was like it was stated as being new and it was fast servi ce thank you i will use this service again when i need something else
B000EVNUF2|4|Very nice decorative stool for in the garage, but the cushion is not comfortable and has very little padding.
B000C75PGK|5|Bought and installed on our 1987 vette in 2011. Fit well and works as it should. No leaks and no loss of fluid to this day. Looks good enough for a semi-show car!
B006FODC3M|5|Excelent product
B00EBH7IDA|5|Great, as described. Product was brand new and being a prime member made the transaction even better.  Look forward to more purchases
B000F159FU|1|i was hoping that it can reduce dust in the car..but it is making more...and it does not fit well.
B0045LGGSK|2|This battery came out ok old stock. Probably from a store that returned it because it was beyond it's shelf life. No more bargain batteries for me &#62;&#62; it's back to Wal Mart for me.
B0013FXTFE|1|Ordered for 99 Lexus RX 300 as per check you fit suggested . However after opening the box the filter is not a fit for the RX300 and the gasket was torn. Amazon was quick to refund .
B0028JQYPG|5|The work perfectly fine and have seen a lot of use so far.
B0002SRF4O|3|I don't know how this will hold up for the long term, but just on installation alone, I can't give this any more than a 3.<br />There were no instructions.  Thank God for Youtube so I could see how to do it.<br />However the insert would not stay in the hole, every time I put it in as threaded on the sparkplug, it would back right out when I removed the plug.<br />Finally I left the plug in the hole over night for the sealant to setup and then I removed the plug and used the hammer on it.  Hopefully it will doing it this way.  otherwise, this gets 0 stars
B001R9P7S8|4|I actually got this for when I'm driving my 66 C10 in cold weather. I have no heater in the truck and sometimes the bitter cold can get a little overwhelming. Now keep in mind that I live in Texas but we do have about 3 cold days a year. My only complaint is how short the straps are that wrap around your head. I absolutely had to get the extender or I would not be able to wear this.
B006KGX2O4|3|The handles for the tools are just a little bit too small to be useful.
B00FL2EFW6|5|Awesome Stickers. Put One On My Workbench & 2 On My Truck. High Quality & Good Price For 3 Stickers
B00700T64O|5|I was ecstatic about getting this part in the very next day after I placed my order! Complete OEM everything fir perfectly, great price and super speedy shipping. I will always start with Hansun for all my OEM part replacements
B00TGCBBGU|5|as always great updated parts, l@@ks great, fit good, easy to do. thanks
B00F66SNV6|1|GM 3rd brake light, also 3rd TIME to change on my 2003 suburban. GM has been very disappointing withal their electrical equipment.
B003AVLAQE|5|Perfect fit
B000DZBHLI|5|I can't believe how good this stuff is for fixing shoes and things like that.  It absolutely saved from the trash two pairs of my shoes where the soles were coming off.  Leather shoes with rubber soles, very comfortable that would have been expensive to replace, saved by a few dollars worth of GOOP!  Love it!
B0002RNQDO|1|the one i received was plastic and was black and red and said &#34;RAM&#34;.. I have a dodge dakota and was looking for one like in the picture, wasn't to happy
B0037S68GM|5|Comes as advertised.  I like it.  Nice garage piece.  A nice item for a car guy or a Springsteen fan....or both.
B00EEQ6WSK|5|Pleased
B00D9H2B76|5|I get about 20 thumbs up a day when I'm driving around with this sticker on the back of my truck.
B000C83R1E|1|It's not a direct fit.  It doesn't plug into the factory wire harness connector very well.  After installing the sensor it showed zero oil pressure. I re-installed my old sensor until I get down to the local auto parts store.
B000CPI5Z0|5|I put this in an older camry and it seems to be running better and belching less fumes.
B002E2J8IC|4|For the price, this mirror is fantastic.  It's less than 1/8th of the price of an OEM mirror, as long as you're okay with a spray can, you can color match it easily (don't forget the clear coat).<br /><br />Unfortunately it does vibrate when driving.  It doesn't impair your rear-view vision, but it is noticeable.  The writing on the mirror also doesn't match the OEM mirror (which has no writing).
B000XQQ0A0|3|I think it is perfect as it is, but for myself I was hoping for it to be a little louder.  Perfect for most people & not even loud enough to annoy a spouse, just not me.
B00062YZZS|5|I am running this in my 06 Yamaha V Star Classic and it runs great.
B000CMEYFS|5|Great spring heavy duty holds up to 350/700r4 great flexes nice. Price is for one spring and you must buy bushing the front and rear eye holes are the same  take larger bushings.
B002OWFLC4|5|I use this in our motor home to prevent battery  discharge. So far it seems to work great.
B001O5QNWE|5|Seller was beyond great.
B000HZT89C|5|Keeping everything neat, tidy, and in a small space that doesn't take up leg room.  Love it!  We moved overseas and couldn't leave it in the car for shipping.  Our stuff was already packed, so we were forced to give it away.  We had it for 6 years and it was still perfect.  Happy to have our new one to use!
B001SF7NE2|2|If you are looking for a side box to carry around styro-foam, you just found it!  This item is VERY thin gauge and dents with a good sneeze.  Also the aluminum dulls quickly.  I don't think I would buy a Tradesman again.
B00G49DVGG|5|I truly recommended 100%
B004LN52EQ|5|purchased this item for my challenger RT. what can i say. its nice. solid metal. only small problem is that the liscense plate comes out of one side just a tiny little bit, as if the plate was a bit to big for the frame.
B000CN9D76|4|These are NOT the bushing in the Amazon stock picture. These are the bushing that are round with the lip on the end.<br /><br />They do not work well with aftermarket shocks that require the hour glass bushings like those pictured.
B004YK3SME|4|Plugs in easily and does the job.  Cord isn't quite long enough to put the unit where I would have preferred but that's a small issue.
B00029K01I|5|very nice!
B001TNK674|1|After I installed it I pushed in the 2&#34; rack only to find a big piece of steel slag inside so could not fit my rack. Bad quality control!<br />Don't buy this product from Draw Tite!!
B001HC48D0|4|I have had this tonneau cover on the last 3 of my vehicles.  My current is a 2012 ram 1500 crew cab short bed.  This by far the worst installation so far.  Not because of the cover, but the bed.  It has a spoiler/flat spot that acts as a rain gutter to funnel water inside the tailgate.  The gap between the bed and tailgate is huge and lets water/dust get in.<br /><br />But I guess it is still better than nothing.<br /><br />I don't think there is a tonneau cover that will stop all water from teh tailgate being up unless it has a bow in it to match the tail gate.  which most do not.
B003EP2RNQ|5|.. I’ve received my order faster than I expect.. and install the spacer right a way... very easy fit .. it takes like 30 Minutes max .. honestly it’s hard to tell if there any improvement.. but it feels like the car breaths a lot better ..
B005U7EAPY|5|Fit nicely, snug - easy install, seem to be wearing well. Protecting the carpet in my new Genesis. I would recommend them, going to get some for my wifes Ford Fusion!
B0032924I2|4|My daughter wanted to redecorate her room and fell in love with these decals. We finally chose this one and ordered it in black. It wasn't quite wide enough to go over her headboard (like the photos show)so I had to modify one of the vines to make it less tall, but wider. See my customer image above.<br /><br />It wasn't very difficult to put on, sort of like one of those tattoos you get out of the gumball machines (but you don't need water.) You peel the backing off, position the decal, then put it face down on your wall and rub the design with a credit card to adhere it to the wall. Then you peel the paper off. You can see through the paper enough to know if you like your positioning. I used masking tape and cut away lots of the extra backing paper to make it easier to do by myself. I rubbed left to right carefully peeling and checking as I went to make sure the design transferred. I didn't have any trouble on my flat-painted wall.<br /><br />I did take one star away because it looked as if the design was gigantic, but you can see from my photo that it isn't ( I don't know what size those 2 beds are in that one photo...there is no way they are twin beds.) Still with a little modification, it spanned the area above her queen bed nicely, although it was no longer as full or tall. I just carefully cut while it was still on the paper and repositioned that part on the other end.  I have no idea how to get this thing off, I imagine using packing tape will lift the design back off...I don't want to resort to sanding! And painting over it would leave a slightly raised design hidden under paint. It wouldn't be reusable, but at least it would be gone.<br /><br />Much easier than hand-painting a mural (which I have done) and the price was fair. If I wanted an entire wall (like in some of the photos), I would order two sets and cut/reposition some of the designs to fit your bigger space.
B00BIO0G7O|5|Perfect fit and fits my trailer just the way it's meant to be. This is a good replacement lens for any trailer.
B007ZUGM5A|1|Sry to say when my mechanic went to install it it was know good so he had to order a new one so was out a $179 for the part the package was open when I recieved it so I don't know if it was something some one returned and some how was sent to me
B0041RV1D8|5|I purchased this product for my mothers 1996 Dodge Neon, a very simple car.  Not only does it fit perfect, It functions amazing.  It is a very soft cushion that fastens in multi spots so it allows to hug your seat.  The heating element is almost instantaneous.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
B006U88WYW|4|The car looks real nice with this Chrome Stainless Steel Exhaust Muffler Tip
B0084F90M2|5|These are quite nice. Very Beautiful and detailed and fit better than the seat covers and steering wheel cover. I have a smaller car
B00GDM5H7U|4|great quality. great price. great product.
B00ARJO1H2|5|Very quick shipping. Product is working well. Fixed the problem.  Searched a while for a good product for a good price.  Found it on Amazon.
B002UZGCSW|5|It's a shame that anytime I want to change my oil, I have to order the filter for my 2010 VW Passat. But this Mann filter is the same that the dealer sells with the VW logo on it. The part number is the same on this filter. Save yourself some money and buy this, you won't regret it!
B002P8CKEY|4|As others have mentioned, this part does not match exactly with the OEM.  On my '98 Cavalier, part that sits flush with the door is slightly larger than the OEM, which I suppose is better than slightly smaller.  But it does mount quickly and easily using a Phillips head and a 10mm wrench and socket.  Since there are no instructions included, do a video search for 'replace side mirror Cavalier' (or Sunfire).  And finally, Amazon had it to me in 2 days as usual.  So for the price and convenience, this is a smart choice for a replacement mirror.
B00E3PDEY2|4|good fit - a little snug. parts seem to be of decent quality build, however, you have to be careful putting them on as they tend to bend a bit if you force them.  With the snug fit they have on the KZ400 carbs,  it is not hard to bend them.
B00B9ARTX6|4|Over all is an excellent helmet! but has no space for Bluetooth speakers on the ears area and XL is even smaller than the L size of my SS700, so if you are L like me go for the XXL...

Glad I purchased this as those that attach at the frame would not have worked for my 12 year old's girls bike or my 8 year old's bike. Before purchasing this we were putting our 4 bikes in the back of my truck and bikes, seats, accessories were getting damaged. This is the perfect setup for our family. The flexibility, quality, price, and ease of use. We will be using it on our road trips throughout the year.
B0035GY61K|3|I bought this \\"no drill\\" kit because of the claimed easy install.  I should have known something was wrong when I opened the box and the brackets were beat up because of a lack packing material to keep things separate.  I then had to redrill the brackets so that they would actually line up with the actual factory through holes (off by alot).  Disappointed at this point and maybe just venting during install, but I'll have wait and see if I actually like the product.
B009G5ERVS|3|While I very much like the price of these bearings, one did not last. I replaced both of my wheel bearings in the front only a month or two apart just due to time, and after only 2 months the drivers side bearing was horrible. I had to go to Autozone and pay double just for one bearing. The passenger side is holding on strong though!! So I could have just gotten a faulty bearing, but it was still very frustrating.
B0052SF0LO|4|Awsome very bright I  happy
B005EGDRUU|5|Very nice cap! Super well made and fits perfect. I love hats and this one is one of my favorites! It forms well to the head and doesnt ride high on top.
B000BSY9J4|4|WORKS OK
B00AYYUKE8|5|I was pleasantly pleased. Much brighter than I expected, but that is not a bad thing..
B008C37GGS|1|Tried to use this paint and the metalic kept separating. It was very runny. You are better off with the factory paint from a dealer.
B00HFX1Z8G|5|It arrived on time and intact. I have to wait till the next tire rotation to ensure it works.<br />Thank you
B0084I80AM|5|Application was simple and easy, totally holds up under all weather! It's the perfect size to be a statement and absolutely legible! So funny and is the perfect addition to my fun loving green car!!
B007XZK2YY|5|I installed this strut bar on my 96 honda civic ek hatch. It fit just fine over the intake mani (i do have an aftermarket AEM intake). The color combo is awesome, too (bronze/black). For $27, you can't beat it.
B00815TW6Y|5|Nicely done Fast Shipping
B00NPYXAWS|3|The little red rubber things that block the metal end from scratching things breaks-off all to often! Also, they're a bit on the small side for using on a seatbelt, let alone 2 when time is of the essence!
B000E4PCGE|5|Exact fitment. The car isn't black, so we're just leaving it as is.
B005E4O0QW|4|excelente producto
B00862LBOI|5|they are bulbs and work like bulbs and shine like bulbs good quality too. So that's about it good bulb.
B00020CB2S|4|My 2004 Honda Civic had some rattles, but mainly suffered due to the thin metals in the trunk and door areas. Despite installing new speakers and a powered sub (an Infinity Basslink), my music really sounded muffled, with a metallic tinge and a lack of mids (especially in songs with vocals). Driving on the freeway always meant turning the volume up, which made the music louder but didn't help in terms of quality. I tried stuffing the area behind the rear wheel wells (on the sides of the trunk) with foam, but that didn't help much.<br /><br />I bought two of these bulk packs back in January but didn't have the time to put them in until late July. I didn't use a heat gun, but did set the sheets outside in the sun for a bit before using them (which did help make the adhesive stickier). I used some odd things (scissors, a chisel to push down on hard to reach areas, the rounded handle of a screwdriver) as well as an old wooden roller, which is basically a necessity if you want the Dynamat to go on evenly and look smooth.<br /><br />I planned to Dynamat the trunk, rear deck, all four doors and under the rear seat area. Taking out all of the lining, popping out the door panels, etc. took a while, but as I had done it before it wasn't difficult. I eventually also Dynamatted parts of the center console and even under the steering column and glove box. It's recommended to use denatured alcohol to wipe down the metals beforehand, but I just used rubbing alcohol and a microfiber cloth. Application is pretty straightforward, but unlike most people, I didn't totally cover the surface of every area, just the majority of it. In other words, the trunk is mostly covered but the rear deck and doors just have patches of Dynamat in certain areas. After scouring many forums, I learned that Dynamat is mainly for vibration dampening and a little goes a long way, so I cut a lot of strips and squares for the doors. Also, certain parts of the car had a secondary metal that was much thicker and didn't really need matting. Conversely, a lot of the plastic trim is thin, so I used Dynamat on their insides (including the insides of those door panels). I ended up using around a box and a half of Dynamat in the end, and plan on using the rest on the ceiling (and/or under the front seats) in the future.<br /><br />I was skeptical in the beginning, but wow, it really did make a difference in terms of sound! You've probably read that your trunk, doors, etc will now sound heavier and denser, and that's true. The real treat is how much better my music sounds. I can actually hear the vocals loud and clear now, and the sub hits a lot harder. I actually had to fine tune my equalizer and reduce the gain on the sub a bit to even things out, but it's definitely an acoustic improvement. I was thinking about buying an amp or two but now I don't need to!<br /><br />The only negative I found was that sometimes when peeling the paper backing off, it will tear and you'll have to dig into the adhesive to get at what's left behind.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the Dynamat adds weight to your car. I'm not sure how much it is, maybe 50-60lbs for two packs like this...which doesn't sound like a lot but is noticeable once you get back on the road.need matting.

B00NE5JQ08|5|The sticker is great quality and is really awesome. I just simply peeled the cover paper off and it stuck right on my front windshield. It's still in perfect condition.
B00FJXKE5E|2|Full disclosure, I am an Android user and Automatic seems to be heavily focused on the iPhone crowd. That said, I have a PLX Kiwi (used for about 1.5 years) and a generic ELM adapter. Being that those are standard bluetooth adapters they will work with any number of OBD applications out there (Dash, Torque and DashCommand are my favorites). Those adapters and apps that work under the standard ecosystem are more reliable and provide a lot more information than Automatic. They can display anything that OBD, where automatic essentially shows you mileage and trouble codes. They are easier to set up. Generally do not require a web account. And did I mention they are more reliable? Automatic has a pretty app and a small adapter, but that's about it unless you really want the social aspect of getting rated among other drivers.<br /><br />The trouble code reporting was the one function that I was really impressed by. I got a CEL (loose gas cap) and the app almost immediately displayed an alert with the code. That is a pretty cool feature when you have to diagnose a CEL. That said, every other app can do this too with user intervention (clicking a button).<br /><br />I have switched back to my PLX Kiwi and will either wire the power switch to a relay so it automatically turns on/off with the car or I'll order one of the other small adapters I've seen that do that. I likely will be throwing my Automatic on ebay in the hopes it is worth something to iPhone users.<br /><br />Recommendation: Buy a different adapter that operates on standard bluetooth and exposes standard OBD for applications (heck try a $10 ELM generic), then check out Dash for the application side.
B00B8CK8TW|1|Poor quality when you drive down the road it shakes and makes it hard to read the gps
B00080QGYG|3|I bought this jack adapter to install a trans in my Nissan Sentra. It was delivered promptly from the seller, and received in 3-4days.  It is a good price at $[...] buck and $[...] in shipping.  It is constructed of heavy duty steel and is of good quality, except for the chain, which I felt was kind of short.  You will need to assemble it, which is fairly easy to do as long as you have a snap ring tool, which I did not so I had to buy one adding to expense.  After assembly, I mounted this on my 2 ton jack and proceeded to mount my Nissan Sentra trans onto the platform.  I had some problems attaching the chain, and when I moved the trans jack, the chain slipped off and the trans shifted.  I moved it into position and to my dismay it was too high to clear the hole in the wheel well.  I jackup up the car using my other jack and moved the jack stand up to the highest level and I still could not maneuver it into position.  The adapter adds about 5-6 inches to your current jack height (its big), and my jack has a minimum of 5-6 in. in its lowest position, then add the trans on top for another 15 in. and your talking 20-22 in. of clearance.  I was not able to clear it, so I was not able to use the product for my trans installation.  I ended up at the rental store, rented a trans jack of shop quality for $21 for 3 hours ($[...] a day).  This product might work if you have a truck or have a second jack which is for SUV's which allows you to jack it up higher get the extra clearance so you can maneuver the trans into position.
B00ODG8IHE|5|Really nice ladies helmet!  Fits great and I have received plenty of compliments!
B001NYYSLY|4|Easy to install, once you read the instructions and take your time. Old fan blades just snapped like dry twigs.
B00EJFH6YA|5|Very bright
B001Q8IXW2|5|There are many applicator pads out there on the market. We prefer these in our business because they are washable. Better than microfiber as they do not scratch or leave marks. We do very high end seasonal detailing and do not use microfiber on anything because of very fine scratches. These cotton pads work very well.
B00KTIVQEW|3|This is exactly what I wanted but I haven't had a chance to program it to my car. So hopefully everything will work out and I don't have to return it.
B0000AX408|5|The stake pockets are heavy duty and they fit 2 x 4 stakes just right.  They are a great value.
B00IA9TP72|5|I love these shoes!
B001N75SUQ|5|It fits my RZR perfectly. It seals out dust as well as water and gives you a place to carry tools as well as lunch.
B008P8FC4I|5|I've traveled with it for 2 yrs. now, best gps for RV's
B004PLFJMY|5|Good
B002PNMMOC|5|This will work perfectly in our 5th wheel trailer, where space is at a premium.
B000BZZEWS|1|these pads DO NOT fit the front discs of a 2007 z4 3.0 coupe.  They are two narrow, leaving a substantial portion of the rotor uncovered; they have a surface area smaller than the OE rotor, and are completely unsatisfactory.  I hope Amazon will correct their erroneous statement that they will fit this car.
B000BQSIWK|4|Here in hot South Texas, batteries are always dead.  If it's not the lawn mower or the RV, it's the 4 wheeler, the scooter or a car.T We use these chargers almost daily and can't live without them.  Just go this one and it seems for be doing fine.  Hope it last longer than the other one we had.  Time will tell.
B007L2JNT4|5|Great fit.  Look like they are original equipment.  Just enough extension to see outside the trailer sides.
B000X1G0R8|4|We've been searching for a LP gas fire pit for quite a while - but they can be very expensive with many of them that we looked at over $1200. This unit is exactly what we were looking for - at a fraction of the cost.  Because it sits on a deck made of TREX, we bought a heat pad to go underneath the unit.  Good quality. The included cloth cover is very substantial and well made.  Very fast delivery.
B00VS039PY|2|these were very hard to switch from left to right when moving lever by hand.maybe they will losen up.
B000CAXICA|5|hi good day this will work this engine 4.6l v8 ford explorer 2002
B000HE6H6K|5|Depending on your type of radiator this is safe to install. Aluminium radiators have a very strong core and shouldn't be a problem. If you have a brass and copper radiator be careful.
B000CCFIGC|5|These stainless headers are a great upgrade from the stock manifold I installed them on my 03 avalanche 1500 5.3l they were bat that difficult to install. The only challenge came when both rear manifold bolts on each side were already snapped off in the head when I got there but my neighbor is a welder and was able to weld a Alan head bolt on the broken stud and back them out . But after those came out install wasn't overly difficult
B004CF2SDQ|1|Only lasted one season.
B0091OE6K6|4|These holders are simple to install and do the job well.  I'm concerned about them unlatching during a crash, but that would allow the seat belt to then work as designed so overall very happy.  I'd recommend them
B005KDO9UY|3|For my 2010 Subaru Forester, the 9005 acts as a dual purpose daytime running light and a high beam.  When acting as a daytime running light, this bulb outputs yellow light (IMHO, just like a stock OEM bulb).  When I flip on the high beams, the bulb then outputs white light which is noticeably better than OEM bulbs. Kinda weird, but I'm assuming whatever coating they put on the bulbs may work best for the high beam setting.  So just dont expect that your daytime lights will look much different.
B001JSYE36|5|Fast delivery and a good product.
B00480N16S|1|One light never worked
B003CX963Y|4|This cover works well. Water resistant, but not waterproof. Holds dust, but won't fit into a standard size washing machine to clean. So I took it to the laundromat to wash it on occasion. I used to use it everyday in the California sun and dust, and my car stayed a lot cleaner all week with it on. It also works well if you go to a place with automatic sprinklers. This cover has saved me from cleaning off a lot of water spots. The fabric is also durable, I have had puppies jump up against it and left no marks on the cover or car below. I also use it WITHOUT a tension strap underneath in the center, and it doesn't seem to flap or ripple in the wind, and I can put it on and take it off faster.
B00GBBDAEU|5|This looks like an OEM Toyota mat. It has a great lip to catch leaks. Protect and fits perfectly
B00FR80J4W|5|works great
B002NZWGWK|5|Installed on a 2012 Prius II - It took about 1 hour of installation due to doing it myself.  I had to put something below the frame in order to &#34;hold&#34; it while I screw the proper parts.  Overall happy and superb product
B00NUROG1E|4|It needs hooks on two of the corners but that was obvious in the photos so I was planning on buying them and have done so.
B000C7VY8I|5|This radiator fit perfectly without any modifications at all. and definitely made to OEM specs.  I would buy it again and recommend it to everyone who is looking for a replacement radiator.  Another benefit was the quick shipping which arrived two days before the estimated delivery date.
B008MOOZXO|5|I looked high and low for this. It was programmed in like ten minutes and I was on my happy way.
B000BNMONC|5|Works very well! The rubber boots that cover the four magnetic feet are cheaply made and wear out quickly! Applied duct tape to mine, no problem now!
B00029WYEY|5|Right price for this product and fast shipping.  I recommend K&N for your vehicles. K&N filters extend the life of your engine.
B0055OFQSC|2|Bumper arrived damaged.<br /><br />I had to drill my own holes for the support brackets. Other than that, it does the job.
B000GV4TIW|5|This regulator is more than I expected.  Combined with the 22 amp cycle electric stator it keeps my battery charged to the max.  I am very satisfied with this product..  Kudos
B004O42DK8|5|Works great in my kx450 rs4 exhaust. Little louder than factory yoshi insert but also deeper. Worth every penny for me.
B000SKYL9I|3|Way too expensive.  Way more than the diesel synthetic I used to buy.
B006F34W9Q|5|I love this ball.  Not too obvious.
B00ERXR9LO|5|This vinyl sticker arrived very quickly and is a thick, durable product. I attached one of the two pack to my Kindle Fire and gave the other to a friend who put it on her car window.
B001DCEMQM|5|great
B000GV95G8|5|These Highway Pegs fit perfectly.  Very easy to install.  Top quality, in every way
B000P72DEE|1|This is advertised and pictured as coming in a wooden case and it's supposed to be digital. Neither is is true, It has an analog counter, which while it is easy to read, is not digital nor acurate. Every time I measure something the reading is different by a few thousands of an inch. It's cheap in cost, not just quality, and accurate enough for what I need it for so I'm going to keep it, but I would not recomend this to any one for no reason other than it's not what they claim it to be.
B000PWZR4C|5|This is one bad as- horn. Loud and proud, I installed on a Honda VT750. Buy the wiring harness makes your life way easier. Took me about 30 minutes to install. Trust me when I say even on a cycle with this horn you get some respect! Buy it you wont regret it.
B0081O9BLG|3|The stickers looks very well, but the quality of the adhesive in a curve surface it´s poor. In my helmet the bigger sticker does not match well.
B000NDBJF4|3|This was a perfect fit in my trailer, and very simple to wire- just strip and insert the trailer wires into the marked slots.  It included a couple of short, tinned wires that I didn't need.    I noted another reviewer, Liz,  gave it \\"1 star\\" ..and agree there was no license plate bracket included, and you can hardly call a couple of extra wires a wiring harness....  I re-used mine. I have purchased these before and knew what to expect... I'd have given this 5 stars for quality, etc...but I am taking off two stars for the inaccuracy of their description, in solidarity with Liz. What's so difficult about correcting the description?
B00B2AFGUQ|5|Looked well built, but didn't fit my bumper as the sales rep said it would, so I returned it. Great return and fast refund. Thank you Rough Country, your products rock!
B000E4COL0|5|Removed and replaced part in less then 10 minutes.  It was a Perfect fit!  I would highly recommend this product!
B002R1B2VQ|3|works just fine.
B000C57KAQ|5|Put quick struts on rear 1992 mazda protege.  I am not very skilled.  With penetrating oil for 2 days it was still hard to get one of the 4 big bolts off with 18in long 1/2in drive bar. Took me about 2.5 hours first side and 1 hr second side. Biggest unexpected problem was I had to push up the strut about 3 inches after I connected the top in order to connect the bottom.  Maybe I was supposed to disconnect the stabilizer bar to drop the wheel hub lower.  Anyway there is a flange to hold the brake line on both sides of the strut and I was able to get the jack under the unused side in order to push the strut up 3 inches.  The car rides so much better now. I am considering doing the front which has an extra step or two.
B0056JC02Q|5|I get comments on this all of the time. Also you can cut off any portion of the sticker you don't want. I love it
B009PF8EZE|5|Replaced the worn hood lift supports with these.  I am very pleased.  Easy to install.
B000DN7T3A|4|Shipping was a little slower than I expected because it was held and combined with other items. It could have been faster.    The product itself works perfectly, as advertised and appears to be a direct OEM equivalent. No complaints. I do not perceive an increase in loudness from the drivers seat compared to the old horns but that was not my motivation for buying these horns. I purchased the high and low models to replace horns that no longer worked.
B001YIYD3C|2|Bought the kit to replace a few fairing bolts that I have lost over the years. Material is super cheap, and the bolt heads get rounded whilst tightening. Would not purchase again.
B00736HOQW|1|IIm really not sure what happened here but somehow my order was canceled and this was a gift for my bama fan bf i was devastated:( where is my BAMA STICKER i was charger for it???
B004ZBIZF2|5|Just looked through everything and I really like it. Haven't had a chance to install them yet.
B000WJX4BQ|5|Great battery. Direct replacement for the factory battery. Initial battery lasted 8 years so there was no question about purchasing another one!
B00042KG3A|5|works fine.  had to unstick the lowering setting of the jack for the first time using it.  other than that one time its been great.
B000LQ78YY|5|Perfect for road trips and other emergencies. comes in handy storage bag.
B001U0CFU2|5|This is a great bag for travel. Plenty of room for several days of clothing. Sturdy and attractive. Would recommend this bag to anyone looking for motorcycle luggage.
B001N2I830|4|Good deal.  My 08 Jetta tail light went out and I needed only one to replace it.  I bought this for $3ish since the 2 pack that was being sold was by a 3rd party and had shipping costs.<br /><br />I got it quickly (love amazon) and it works perfectly.  The only thing I didn't like was the packaging.  It looks like a bulk item (but I can't tell if its new or not) and is packed in a plastic bag (\\"shipping invoice enclosed\\" bag).  And then amazon packed it in a 5\\"x5\\"x5\\" box!
B000EAIERW|4|I added these along with a set of smittybilt ones I already had to my jeep. The grip is much thicker on the Rampage handles, which I prefer to the thinner smittybilt grips.
B00GBW8DDW|5|It was what I expected.  A sticker!
B002N5PNS4|5|Had one before killed by the weed eater  Perfect for second time around
B00RETZWQ2|5|Love these! So flag I got them!
B000N3W8J0|5|works great, I purchased a bucket at Home Depot as I wanted to make sure it fit....there are no clear answers on Amazon as to which bucket it fits into.
B0016LE80K|3|Seems to come out of the socket too easily - just wiggling the cable will cause it to come out enough to lose power.
B000276B2C|5|I use these on our two Honda Shadow motorcycles.  Fram quality.
B00B6QET2M|5|Looks factory installef. The wife loved it. Much cheaper then what the dealer wanted. Instructions were easy to follow, they give you mounting templates to tape to the trunk lid. Just take your time and measure, measure, measure. Cause once you drill that first hole your committed. It's been on the car now for about 5 months. Been thru many car washes and no leaks, no fading so far. Only thing I can say is don't slam the trunk lid, try and support the wing with one hand while closing the lid with the other. Less likely to weaken the metal at the mounting locations over time.
B007D7QP3Y|5|Way better than the original, which I replaced twice in three years at twice the price.  Yes, they have more umph than original in both opening and closing and I'm ok with that.
B004GFTC0E|5|First thing thanks to Naples discount for fast shipping, very nice packing and delivery within a week 5 stars! Next this product is very good, lots better than mothers power ball kit or turtle wax hand kit. i have tried both and never was 100% clear just About 65% or 75% clear, i just got the 3M advance headlight restore kit today and my headlights where a light yellow color before on my 97 Dodge ram and now they are almost new looking 100% clear NO YELLOW!, it is amazing how much better they are at night now, the kits says 30 minutes a headlight, it took About 2 hours for both, i do recommend this kit it does as it say restore!! I also found that Eric the car guy on Youtube.com was helpful in learning how to restore headlights with these kits!
B008OM0ZH4|5|At first i was a bit skeptical from the low price, but wow was i wrong. Very straightforward installation, minimal wiring modifications required for plug and play, and of course greatly improved aesthetics over stock.
B00CQHFUM8|4|Well, I like the shirt a lot. Took a star off due to the fabric not being very soft. Seems a little rough. I love the shirts that are soft and kind of stretchy. This seems like a rough non stretchy shirt with a nice emblem ironed on lol.
B00CPSXPUW|5|some people don't know what it is, but the ones who do, love my sticker so it makes me happy lol
B004VLOOEW|4|Build quality appears to be equal to OEM, though the form is a little different. The sensor end that fits into the engine is not stepped but is one diameter from base to tip, making fitting a little difficult. The trick is to clean the hole very well before fitting the new sensor so that no excess force is required to install it. Works as it's supposed to, no more CEL and has been working fine for a month now.
B00CFMMZ0O|5|this is vibrant in color and it looks fantastic with the color scheme in my son's room and has held true to its color
B00AC6SAZE|5|Glad I bought these!  Use them all the time, even in the house.  Used in a truck with the window down and my wife couldn't tell.
B002OMVRJK|4|The installation of this door was very easy for me to install on my 2012 Dodge Laramie 3500 truck. In addition to the nuts supplied with the little screws, I installed 2 rabbit eared nuts to lock against the supplied nuts, so that they would not rattle off over time. The one draw back for this door is the cheap lock system supplied with it. I have a 2003 5th wheel and the outside doors on it have the same locking keys. I am sure though that this lock can be changed out (which I will do at some point). For the rest it fits tight against my truck and looks great.
B00A7NQPAE|1|I bought these boots for my son - the strap broke w/in a month - now I cant return them because I've missed the return window.<br />Hopefully I can buy replacement straps?
B000PIGH54|4|This product is just fine. there have been no problems with it yet and we got it almost a year ago. No snapping of this product and it's also pretty cheap.
B00EK5EVBK|3|Only reason why I give it three stars is because for some reason the drivers side blinker doesn't work properly at times. There's a 50/50 chance of it working and then once it doesn't work it won't for the rest of the day. Looks great though
B0039OWXOK|5|Great price!
B0002SQTJQ|5|I needed this line to go from this pump[[ASIN:B000XSI902 OTC 2510A Stinger Air/Hydraulic Pump]] to my JD2 model 32 bender cylinder.  I also needed this adapter[[ASIN:B0002SQTJG OTC 9798 3/8\\" Hose Half Coupler]]
B00BI8RTAC|4|buttons &#34;click&#34; on this one but it is a great working perfect fit for factory replacement
B000CMJ1DI|3|A lot of power drain for very little light. Nothing special about the housing.<br /><br />I was more tolerant of this as a solution until I used them a bit.<br /><br />Sure, the price was very reasonable. But they don't put out much light.<br /><br />Try to find an LED solution instead if you can.
B001GDTSVM|4|This bar is good for the price but I did struggle getting it on my car. The fitment was not perfect. Other then that I like this bar.
B000EDOSKG|3|Works good.I would buy this again if I needed to.I would buy this again if I needed to. Product was exactly as described and I am very happy with it.
B000XEU8FK|5|This very deep 30 mm socket is strong and realizable for axle nuts. it is a very perfect machine fit so no worry of rounding it or the nut off.
B001RBCU90|4|Nice sticker. Thank you
B000CONU0G|5|Put them on last weekend and works as advertised. It appears to be a high quality product.
B002ZTNW90|5|Great
B0016ZM61O|5|its good brand!!
B00498DK60|5|All the parts fit for my 2005 Mazda 6i, with the 2.3L 4-cylinder engine as confirmed with Amazon's part compatibility tool. The tensioner is smaller in depth from the original but the bolt holes fit just fine. Belt quality seems good.
B000BUV1RK|5|We put this heater in our R.V. trailer and were very surprised to find that it put out enough heat to make our 29 foot RV very comfortable. It uses only a fraction of the propane that a normal RV heater uses. We have always been aware that the original heater dumps most of the heat out side. This heater uses just a fraction of the propane..........AND it's totally quiet. Yes I'm a very satisfied customer.
B005JU5W54|3|I bought these wipers for my Toyota Prius.  They worked really well when I first got them.  It seems to me that I had to replace them sooner than I would've liked.  Especially for the price.  I might try another brand to see if they will last longer.
B00AW82TQS|5|Excellent product.
B007SKAKPU|4|buena
B00CFCHSZG|5|I bought a pre-owned 2011 Prius and it only came with the driver's side mat. Found these and ordered because for the price, why not try it? So glad I did. This is by far the cheapest set you will find, and the color perfectly matched the existing Prius mat. I have the light grey interior, which came with a darker charcoal mat. These match and fit just right. Its been several months of everyday use and they still look good too- no pilling or anything. So pleased with this purchase. I didn't use the driver's side matt, so I cannot speak to how that fits.
B002NAMJHC|4|On our 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe, the first light took about 15 minutes as I was being extra careful about the install.  The second light took about 10 minutes mostly due to other parts being in the way.  It was easy and only took a screwdriver to install.  The lights look great and provide a crisp clean light.  All in all we have been really please both with the cost and the quality of the lights.<br /><br />UPDATE: After about 9 months the main lamps in both headlights failed.  It is easy to replace the lamps, but it is a little disappointing to have the lamps go out so quickly.  Since both failed almost simultaneously, I lean towards the bulbs just being lower quality.  I deducted one star for this moderately fast lamp fail.  The housing is still holding up well and staying clear so they are aging well.
B002P8D5J8|5|Very easy to install.
B002I03ZIE|5|Went on smoothly and looks really cool.
B0046R3X7A|5|This hood protector is amazing!  It almost looks like a second skin!  Doesn't really stick like a eyesore.  Very low & clean easy install.  Just amke sure when you install It.  Clean hood good & then use iso alochol and slowly well sticking the aeroskin on.  Peel the tape a little bit at a time while u put it on.  Don't peel all & stick.. Then your screwed!..Haha When its uneven & you need to fix it.  Very hard to remove etc..
B000VUC51G|5|Great product fits my 2013 Tacoma Double cab Long bed perfect. Cut outs for the D rings in back and for wheel wells. Heavy and non-skid surface.
B000150J5K|1|Rear pair for dualleys fit great and look awesome but the frount ones were a fight to install and they would not seat properly and they stick out about one 1/4 inch.<br />The first trip out I lost one front cover and I am surely not going to buy another set for one cover.
B000KE8W60|5|Fit and finish of this shift knob is absolutely beautiful. I bought this one to replace an identical Momo shift knob that is kind of worn out from constant use. The old shift knob lasted approx 7 yrs of daily use before it really started looking beat up (the leather is the part that wore out). I would highly recommend this shift knob and buying through Amazon was both fast & easy.
B006HYA7CY|5|This Bumper looks great on my XJ.  if I had one complaint, its a pain to install. best to set aside an afternoon, and have a buddy help you mount the bumper on the brackets.  But the benefits of it being a big healthy bumper with a nice solid winch mount make up for any problems with the installation.
B002M574O6|5|Pleased with this purchase.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Great product, worked exactly as described.
B000COBXPA|5|Got this to drag trees for firewood. Works perfectly. Plenty strong and well made. Could use a slightly longer one, but doesnt seem to be available.
B001DKQNUC|4|This was not nearly as dark as I was hoping it would be based in the picture online here.  If I were to compare it to window tints it would probably be a 10% transparency, which isn't much.  The plus side of that is that you certainly won't be pulled over by cops for it.<br /><br />Also, it definitively will not fit a frame over this due to curvature.<br /><br />Still looks good though.
B000WK8EGA|3|Very easy to install. Cruising over 50 mph with my helmet on I get baffled terribly by the wind because the shield is throwing the wind straight to your head. If you lean forward and take cover behind the screen it becomes more useful. Definitely gets the wind off your chest, but I also found that to be annoying as well on hot days because then you don't get the wind to cool down your torso. All in all, I decided to sell it to my friend because I didn't enjoy the reduced wind on my chest or the wind baffling my head causing it to shake and vibrate so I couldn't focus on the road.
B003IS3HV0|5|Wonderful stuff!!  Be sure to purchase!  This is outstanding on the horse tack that I use it on, will purchase again.
B00AZMICOY|4|I really like this bottle, but for me it is just too big. I underestimated how big it was and ended up also getting the 40oz by the same brand and that is more the size I need. It's not really fair for me to take a star from the product b/c it does exactly what it's supposed to, but for my purpose the 40 oz was what i needed.
B00MOL3BWM|5|I love the curved light and it fits on my roof mounting screw for my CF moto 800ez after just a few minor adjustments to the mounting brackets.  The light is very bright it it will work well on the wooded trails here in Payson Az
B0053ZJ6I4|4|I'm not really sure what to say. It's a sticker. It sticks. So....hooray!<br /><br />It's been thru a Phoenix summer and lost minimal color, so I guess that's another plus. It's not curling off at the edges. Yet another plus.<br /><br />Three cheers for the sticker!
B003UG7SK6|5|I have a poor memory and would forget to put the handicap sticker up. Now it is in sight and I do not have to remember to put it up.
B008XB1ZWU|5|PERFECT REPLACMENT
B002X1NLOQ|5|Item exceeded my expectations.  Service was very quick and the price was much lower than it would have been from a dealer.
B000N5RLKO|5|These fit my xr 250 and my xr 600 and xr650l. The quality is pretty good. Comes with the ties to zip em on.
B005TCM854|5|It fit my 99 f250 super cab short bed perfectly except i had to get a sleeve to attach one piece that was not stretched to slide over the tail pipe other than that it went in with out any problems. It has a 4&#34; off the turbo to the bottom bend then it turns to 5&#34; all the way out and i stuck on a 7&#34; tip. It looks good
B00PTSX2ZS|5|Awesome product !
B00DDZWAZW|3|The tools are not reusable but the battery is OEM as described.  One of the pry bars broke when trying to remove the battery.  I was able to make them work but they're just disposable grade. I've used the battery for a couple months now and been pleased with it's performance.
B000IYSIOS|5|watch replace video on youtube:[...]<br />works excellently and appreciated the extra tips like saving certain screws and way not to break other plastic things needed to reinstall
B000WJEORY|5|Does what needs to be done at the correct price.  Compact enough to keep it on the saddlebag, easy to use.  Bleeder and non leak valve features are key.
B005OK3MOM|1|Plastic packaging that the product was shipped in literally vibrated/rubbed the chrome off. Very cheap product. Seller was awesome though and refunded my purchase. I don't know where to buy the GOOD, U.S.A. made version of these (my father always had them on his cars and the ones he has from the 1960's are still holding up with a little chrome polish!) but I'd DEFINITELY look around, unless you're okay with the product appearing worn, old, and dull from the day you put these on.
B008LZLU3W|4|Great fit, sharp image reflection and easy to clean!  Honda shadow 1100 bike
B006GBAOPI|5|Great
B001OCOOB4|5|Perfect fit!
B00GKMPJ2Q|5|There appears to be two different sizes. I ordered 2 of these from Amazon Prime and they were both the smaller size which only fit snug on the right hand side dash hole. When I went to the left hand side I noticed it was loose. So loose than it was very easy to remove it without any pushing on the inner tabs. When I compared the two original socket covers to what I received from here, only the right side was the exact plug, the left was slight thicker on the outer diameter that contacts with the dash(not the metal outlet). So I just ordered another cover from the other amazon listing that has poor reviews all complaining the size is too large which is what I need. Hope this helps.<br /><br />85535-AE020-C0 requires the smaller of the two dash size holes. If you find this part is WAYY to loose then you need the 85535-AE010 which has thicker plastic for a larger diameter dash hole. The size difference is minor and hard to notice. Still makes me wonder why the two sizes. Compare the image and the one of the left is slightly slimmer then the right.  Well I hope this helps someone down the road, I ended up with an extra one because I didn't realize there were two sizes. At least I have a back up for the right had side hole on my dash.
B00437IHOC|5|Outstanding!  Lifted a 27' LVL 700lb beam 14' in the air in less than 2 minutes, BY MYSELF!.  Battery charge was appropriate, didn't encounter any stoppage time due to it being cordless.  Also use it to pull rotted fence post concrete balls out of the ground, and moving logs around the jobsite.<br /><br />Plan to replace the steel cable with an after market plasma line at some point, but happy with it so far.  Will keep an eye on the battery charge life as time goes on.<br /><br />Highly recommend
B000S2OR86|5|Sweet gonna be an awesome swap on my 72 Monte Carlo with the 08-12 5 lug Cts -v Rotors and brackets from kore3 there huge
B0002YPD7O|1|This thing is &#34;JUNK&#34;  it's made of a very poor quality aluminum pot metal.  I dropped it on the ground from my tailgate onto concrete.  The neck between the lock and the flat disk broke completely in half with no effort.  The casting has many air pockets in it.  Definately defective......  A thief could make off with your property with just a rock hitting it.
B0012WW2LK|1|It says it will fit yj... its wrong... also its all black no chrome like pictured. Amazon needs to get there **** together.
B0080E7LPA|4|Everything is as expected. Delivered on time with no damage. Was hoping it had a oil plug seal ring but it did Not,
B00F5EWTHS|5|My husband loves them. They fit great in his car and he likes how you can easily rinse them when they are dirty
B000C3BB6M|5|I have been running this for a couple years now without any issues.
B00D4AW82Q|3|Didn't realize it covers chrome grill
B002L154ZM|4|The shorter cables is a little thicker than the orginal but still functional.
B004X5QPI4|5|Good price..
B000WK90N6|5|Just put these on my Harley Nightster a few days ago along with the Progressive brand rear shocks, and the ride is noticeably smoother. They really helped smooth out the jarring bumps the Nightster is known for finding on even the smoothest roadway. Really easy upgrade to do.
B00NJ9MZH0|4|Get ready for a bit of an adjustment.  Bulbs appear to be of high quality and fit perfectly in my 2013 Electra Glide Limited's spot lamp housings. Color is definitively whiter than the stock halogen 881 bulb. They are NOT brighter however. As with other LED bulbs, these tend to throw a slightly wider and less well defined spot as they do not have a reflector tip like a standard 881 halogen. You WILL have to adjust the aim height slightly after installation, mine had to be lowered about 3 inches, so as not to blind oncoming drivers. Have an H4 LED headlamp bulb on the way to go with these spot LED's. As with other reviewers, would have given these bulbs five stars if they were a little brighter..say 650 lumens or so.  BUT, they do what they say they will do.
B00FB3OXRW|5|I ran into problems while trying to install on my 2004 STI. The front lower mounts are for 2005-2007. The camber bolt pattern changed from 2004-2005 on the STI. However, the company that makes them ISC was kind enough to provide me with the correct bottom mounts. Their support is great.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is standard operating procedure but before you buy them consult with the seller and tell them about this issue to make sure you get the right bottom mounts for your 2004 STI. Aside from that you might find some conflicting installation instructions. I confirmed that the preload on the springs should be set to 5mm not 15mm.<br /><br />I like their constructions, wide range of adjustments, ride quality, and not to mention the ISC support. Also you can't beat the price for what you get. One more thing, keep in mind there are two versions basic and regular. Basics have a fixed rear camber plate whereas the regular ones (are more expensive) but have an adjustable camber plate and pillow ball mounts. These can also be purchased separately from ISC if you wish to upgrade.
B00TGPGQU8|5|Very high quality, the dimensions are accurate, very smooth transition from the small to big end. Excellent product.
B008J4UMX4|5|Easy to install and fit my 99 Dyna perfect. Much better looking than stock football. Not sure how it will perform in heavy rain, will update later on that.
B000H5WRPO|4|Good fit to wheel, sturdy tube, no installation issues, but still need to add air occasionally, like conventional non-slime tubes.
B00FJ91A74|2|Very small compared to suggestive marketing picture ! Way overpriced for its size !
B0075E8EUC|5|Nice, thick and good quality material. Was better than I was expecting it to be.
B000IYXKBO|3|Bought for my daughter
B000CLUERQ|3|ok
B000XD8NOY|4|met expectations
B000CITK8S|5|Purchased this to top off a motorcycle battery on a BMW G650GS. It does a great job keeping it charged up.
B00HE7SJ7S|5|awesome lights just put them in super bright as far as quality not sure yet but so far so good
B00CFLCPKA|3|they might be better than the standard stock bulbs but one of these bulbs didnt give me the brightness i was looking for maybe two if it was possible would be just right..
B0009IK5XA|5|Worked extremely well.  I installed them in minutes and had a streak-free windshield since.  Price was fantastic, compared to my local Mercedes dealership.  1/5th the cost!!  Would definitely purchase again!!
B0002KKIXC|1|The plastic top broke. Not able to use anymore.
B00AOGL60I|1|No instructions included and some pieces are not &#34;universal&#34;
B00KTHQR0Q|5|Great item that saved me$175. Local locksmith programmed for $40 in 5 minutes. My only FAB was broken. I ordered a second fab and now that I have one that works I can Program the second one myself for free!
B005FL6SPU|1|The rotors in this kit are the $99 ones not the $169. I had send them back to get them same ones delivered again. DON'T BUY THESE
B0010Z4MDK|5|Overall, works as a replacement for my garage door opener with battery backup. My initial battery lasted about 5 years - hope this will last as long. Perfect fit.
B008ITZ6F4|5|Great quality and looks fantastic.... Would def recommend this product.
B005GO5E10|1|It is overpriced to begin with and still did not work for me. Save your money. Diehard has better product.
B00RTWNG94|5|I have made several purchases of Flag It products and will continue to make future purchases.  Great products, great quality and all at great prices too.
B00WL11AMS|5|The Kensun portable air compressor is awesome. It is small compact and easy to use. Nice to have with you in your can in case on a small tire leak or even going to the park to air up a ball or bike tire. GREAT product and would recommend to any one looking for a portable air compressor.
B002QMV70M|1|poor seal design, failed, not worth the money. non-rebuildable hydraulic unit. buy a different jack.
B00DF8C25U|5|Part was great and came quickly.  The install would have went smoother if it wasn't for the following: 1) Headlight knob was incredibly hard to get off.  2) part of my dashboard that you pop off was glued on, I thought it was going to break for sure, but after a lot of tugging and twisting the panel final came off. 3) One of the T20 screws was stripped, had to use a mini vise grip to get it off.  4) the motor that was attached to the plastic part of the cluster had glue all around it.  Had to take a very small &#34;eyeglass&#34; screw driver to scrap the glue away so the metal clasp could lifted allowing the motor to twist off.  This took most of my time, I was sure the plastic was going to break but I was finally able to twist the motor off.  After that, installing the parts and re-assembling everything was a piece of cake.  But if the plastic had broke that holds the motor in place, this install would have failed.  I am the original owner of a 1996 Mustang.
B001GMX9FO|5|Super easy to install, took me 15min. Perfect upgrade for my Mazda CX-5
B00MX9TOMG|3|Get a bigger size than what you need.
B0007Y4P8W|5|Fantastic buy as an add on item.  I bought a couple extra as spares and already had to use one so I still have a spare left.  I will be back for more if another one falls off.
B000FQ97QC|2|I bought this product to replace my old rusted beat up sending unit. It looks great out of the box, but you will have to grind the lip down to get it to fit in the gas tank. This DOES NOT FIT out of the box. If you do not want to modify something brand new out of the box (which I believe you should never have to do) then do not buy this particular sending unit. Also, it does not come with the sock you will have to purchase that separate. I have not finished my project and actually started the jeep yet so I may have even more bad news to report when all is said and done.
B0079XC0ZY|1|Heating element did not work in seat.
B000C8XRHS|5|Perfect
B007J0V7MO|5|These LED lights worked perfect for the Bike Taillight I was installing them in. Although the description says 12V most LED Bulbs will work at 6V so I took a chance and they work great at 6V. I will purchase again.
B00BITKJNK|5|Good quality and easy to install
B000H8XO3A|5|This was exactly what I need in my 2002 Town & Country. Very easy to install, my van no longer has cataracts.
B00ACR6QIG|5|Let everyone know how mad you are that since 2009 the stock markets are up almost 200%, unemployment has been cut in half, the deficit has been cut in half and we have two fewer wars.
B000MIT5VA|4|I was impressed with the soundbar, it was as advertised and is a quality unit .<br />It was well worth the money.<br />The mounting system was a little cheap, I was able to modify it and make due.
B001R5D66M|5|the lights were brand new ....they fit perfect...look great !!..... they shipped quick !!  great set of lights !!  if i need other lights ill buy from here first !!
B00W5NZFJQ|5|Fit great, good price.
B001CO2HP4|5|Improve throttle response, installation and fitment also good
B003ZWB496|5|Was great thanks!!!!
B0067UBTPM|5|Guess it works looked fine but I got wrong part I needed front side or something
B008H3YKD0|1|These mirrors are poorly made, have hardware that doesn't fit a golf cart, and the plastic mounts are flimsy.  They are going back.  I thought the extra couple of bucks would get me a better product, but just the opposite....I got junk.  DO NOT BUY!
B003UM9GDM|5|this makes a world of a difference when working on your bike in your own garage
B001TK7CYM|2|cheap... already had to pop lenses back in...
B000E8T83S|4|It filters oil.  I haven't had an engine explode and I've been using Purolator for years so I guess they make a pretty nice filter.  The price is right and they arrived quickly.  Very happy with my purchase.
B0048J2OFS|5|Best ever. Work way better then the old ones
B00S4JUW9S|4|ok
B00A6PFD5G|2|I used the sizing guide provided by the supplier, a good feature and they are to be recommended for providing the guide, but the helmet didn't fit and has to be returned. I called the supplier and got very friendly and very competent support, unfortunately I have a big head and they don't have a product that will fit my head. So I am out the wait for the original helmet and now the credit for returning the helmet and $18.xx for the ups charges. This is not necessarily their fault, but be aware of the potential sizing problem.
B008G3KG70|5|Highly recommend these lights. It  puts a new look to your truck.
B00WKK48BU|4|Pretty cool - not metal
B0031BJULU|5|good stuff
B00B3BKM1M|5|Cool
B00MJUMZ66|5|GREAT product.  I have used this product for a number of years on my personal vehicles and my motorhome and it provides excellent protection, especially UV protection.  It is works wonderfully for all plastic, vinyl and rubber parts on the exterior as well as interior components, as it seems to rejuvenate them and bring back original color, especially on black plastic, vinyl and rubber components.<br /><br />Would highly recommend to a friend.
B00RUZW4KM|5|Happy with product.. Back to smooth ride.
B000JFJLP6|5|We have a 1997 Ford Super Duty bucket truck at work, with the 460 c.i. (8-liter) gas engine. The battery had been worthless when we parked it a month ago for repair. I turned the key to see if we even had enough juice to turn on the indicator lights on the dash - nothing. Nothing at all.  I connected the Jump and Carry (JNC660) and it started right up, with above-normal crank speed and no drama.  Very impressive device if you ask me.
B007OTGZ40|5|Great product, I like to protect my investments and this sure will do the job. Didn't take but 4 days to get here! Thank You!
B00JIAUU80|1|Don't buy this product!!! you will get the wrong size turning signals and they won't replace it!
B00332GMOA|5|Had some scratches along the top of my bed rails, cleaned them up and repainted them, but you could still see them in the light so I got these to cover the bed rails and prevent me from doing this constantly. These fit well, and have resisted any scratching, happy with them ran them through at least 15 car washes no sign of them lifting up.  Holes do line up, maybe a 16th of an inch off.  Had help installing them lot's of tape to take off!
B001PWA0IO|5|easy install, works great, short money, its a no brainer Dee Zee Tailgate assist high quality you can't see it
B006B2XVKC|5|Nothing beats the perfect fit these provide.  Custom made for the vehicle, they are a snap to put up and take down.  And they really do make a difference if you park in the sun.  I buy one for each new car I've gotten over the years.
B000EIXQ5Y|1|This is a reasonable measurement tool. However, you need to ensure it is accurate enough for your needs. Initial accuracy is ±4°F (about ±2°C). But when the meter gets cold, the meter reads a much lower and more inaccurate temperature. Therefore, you need to keep the meter in room temperatures, and if you need to make a reading in a cold ambient temperature, do so quickly.    The meter is easy to operate and read and seems quite robust; I have dropped one onto concrete and it survived.     The odd thing is Amazon asked me how to rate this toy when I wrote this review!
B001BTK1O4|5|I  had it on from Hamilton, MT to Alaska and back. 8,000 Miles and not a hitch. Good fit. I would buy again.
B00FX3SVL4|4|This little charger is great. Having option of both a USB and cigarette lighter is heaven-sent- since sometimes accessories have one or the either.<br />It mounts easily to different size handlebars- I know this because I placed it in two different places of my tapered handlebar- the rubber inserts help in making a good fit. Just because of how I placed it, the weather-proof covers are upside down but that's ok. The option of using adhesive or the mount is also great. Whoever sees it is jealous they didnt get it!<br />So far used the USB part to charge the phone using GPS and the lighter part to use a Slime air compressor- no problems.<br />Definitely recommend it.
B0002MBKUU|5|Have had this cover for quite some time now (over 6 months) it still looks brand new and not faded. Definitely recommend it.
B009HVPV4S|5|It works as described at a good price.
B004X4B8DC|5|This is a 22mm 1.5 thread pitch.  Fits a Kubota D902 three cylinder diesel perfectly.
B00KLSX3ZK|5|I bought this for my 2012 camry se. I had this installed at a local shop for $120. The video quality is amazing! They installed it in the center of the car and it works great.
B004XRI3JG|1|This product looked cool but was cheaply made and didn't last but two weeks. I would not recommend this product to someone that actually uses their keys.
B00948ZI6A|5|I bought this for my brother to go with his birthday gift and he loved it. The scent doesn't last too long but it looks great and keeps his cup holders clean.
B00B6QF14W|5|very nice  spoiler mounted perfectly
B0067ERIWQ|5|Half price is always good!
B0014COKYU|4|I used this product to removed dried on deck stain from my vinyl siding and removed dried paint from a sink faucet that 409 didn't begin to touch.  Spray Nine didn't damage either of the surfaces (I did wash them off with water shortly after cleaning).  I would highly recommend this product.  One negative is that it did leak a bit during shipping.
B005OZNZD0|5|I could not get over the cost verses buying them at the local ford dealer.  They work great and had them cut at the local Home Depot.  They work just as well at the key that came with my truck!!
B000BPTUR8|5|Works well, can't beat the price.
B000C16XL2|5|Seems to be a great product, easy install hopefully last longer then OEM.
B00E0SJJT6|4|Fits great
B00COYNZJ8|4|It fits perfectly to my Toyota Rav 4 2007. All my friends love it and me too!
B001DX55QC|3|it looks good under the hood, it save more space than the old one, but when first time install only one from three bolts go easliy in the holes of the car the others couldn't fit without modifying sheet plate in the workshop, also the sheet plate was long so the hood of the car couldn't close, you have to shorten it in the workshop, for the performance i couldn't notice any in the car accelartion that what i had tested only, i am not sure about the horse power gain.
B000CCIFQM|5|great i have old high performance engine cleaned it up after 2 uses...has zinc which is needed, oil stays clean now
B008RAD3NG|5|This is the second one I ordered. The first worked so well on the back I decided to get one for the front.
B00029X100|5|I bought these because my current tire setup is a little wide so my rear driver tire slung up a rock and crack my mirror. I got them for a smokin' deal here on Amazon--$50 free shipping. It was an open box item sold by Amazon, but when arrived had everything. It was fairly easy to install. The wire insert feature seems to help keep shape at the sharper curves. It also saved my arse from getting a ticket. I was pulled over for a supposed non working blinker(it worked and I never got the ticket), but the cop circled around my car looking at the tires and said they were borderline, but looked to be ok, so he let me go. Had I not had them on, I'd definitely would've gotten a ticket.
B000GTTNZI|5|Smoothed out my ride
B0006309VG|5|nice
B001O7Q6Y2|5|Fit perfectly on my 1995 525i. If you've had problems finding a neutral switch that fit your BMW, try one of these.
B000F18VHI|4|Fits well
B00N0IHMXM|1|This is just what I needed to speed up the process of raising and lowering g the jacks.
B00AP7CS7Q|4|Cute! I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, since she recently bought a new car. We did have to struggle a tab bit to stick it properly to the car, but after it stuck, it stuck for good.
B0096QADHY|5|Very nice and impressive. Bold white letters on the black frame make it really stand out.
B0023VBPC6|4|I would have rated 5 stars, but the mounting brackets came slightly bent and had to be adjusted before the thing would mount to my truck. This was extremely difficult due to the fact that when you are lining up the brackets to the holes, it all happens inside the wall of the bed. You have to go by feel and intuition. There is no way to see what you are trying to aim for. Once the brackets were properly adjusted, it slid right in and lit up perfectly.
B00T0XHKKG|5|Great product I'll post pics when I'm done instaling!
B0049JVD7W|5|USed this while driving across the country, and the other car had the Wilson 300 lil wil.  Both worked great and was very clear.  Very happy and easy to install, this thing will not move, and we were going 80 most of the way.  The magnet is HEAVY duty.
B00332GOA2|1|The order and shipping went smooth through Amazon. I revieved the Rail Caps pretty quick but that's the only good thing I can say. After opening and installing the caps, I found that they seemed to be cut wrong or uneven. They did not line up right at all. After a bit of doctoring I had them looking ok. Everything was going good until about 4 months after I put them on. The passenger side cap decided to fly off my truck while I was driving down the interstate. Now you're probably thinking that I didn't clean the bed rail good enough before I installed them, but the fact that the double sided tape or whatever Wade used is still on my bed rails and didn't come off when the cap flew off tells me that Wade needs to clean the bottom side of the caps or upgrade the adhesive they use. An absolute waste of money these things are. I always heard of better products coming from Wade. What a let down!!
B002QOZBWU|5|Looks great
B0033WNIT2|4|This took about an hour to install. It is very easy if the holes line up. Five bolts line up perfect, the sixth was a bit of a problem but took a bit of &#34;working it&#34;  to get it secured. Overall I like it and would recommend to anyone, just be patient.
B00HQYTTXC|2|So I wanted something to fit on my seat belts so they don't rub my skin especially in the summer. And they work for that. But here's what else they do; the seat belt doesn't retract correctly with these on. Too bad, it's a good idea but really an annoying feature.
B0012ARRCQ|5|Quality product
B0031B1YWI|4|google you tub on how to install...easy once you figure out how to get tabs out of the old one.  alot of f150's have these go bad...Ford shoudl have mad this out of metal not plastic
B008R0LF9K|5|Replacement module can be combined with the speaker/earbud and microphone of your choice rather than just  getting the one that comes with the speakers for the same price or cheaper. works awesome for answering calls, listening to music etc. The knob allows you to have full functions with gloves on, no need for feel or touchscreen. paired perfect with 3 other sena headsets. battery life is as advertised. works fine after riding in a light rain. definitely worth it.
B005NFI20C|5|These are great pads.I ride 06 gsxr 600,great stopping power
B000P5JTKC|5|I love this keychain. I bought it at the dealership in Huntington, NY at the same price it is available on amazon. When you pull on the ring, it detaches slightly allowing you to remove a key or the fob, which is a useful feature if you valet park your car and need to give attendants the fob but keep the other keys. Unless you deliberately pull on the ring, the keys will not come off. The logo is small and unassuming and the steel harmonizes nicely with the black leather strap.
B003IS3HV0|5|Turned my beat up Leather Oxfords into better-than-new condition!  Amazing product.
B0012PQBVE|5|awesome parts. worked perfect on my 01 Silverado..... thank you amazon...
B0008FUF34|5|As described
B000CSQEV4|5|worked as expected
B004JBWCNY|5|I love it!!!!! Quick shipping. My son in law loved it! Nice quality. Would buy again. Very happy with what I ordered
B007V3BEJA|4|Exactly what I needed for my BMW 335i. However, i was shipped two sets of mats. I ordered one. I paid for one.<br /><br />Please advise: this is<br /> my second attempt to correct your shipping error.<br /><br />-Steve
B003RWJ9I2|5|I purchased a replacement remote and was hesitant about the ease of programming. I was also skeptical about product. It was brand new, came with a battery, programming instructions, and took me 30 seconds to program. Very simple and the remote works great!!! Would give more than 5 stars if possible.
B00PIXPXBU|5|The fit was perfect.  Great Quality
B000BUU5XQ|5|They are inexpensive and work well. It keeps my jacks from sinking into the ground and stabilizes them so we don't have any issues.
B000CC4O58|5|My review is more of the concept of deer warning whistles and not this particular product because I am pretty sure they are all the same.I have never had a vehicle that did not have these on them and I have never hit a deer in my life.I have traveled all over the U.S. and actually seen deer approaching the road from a distance and then turn around and run the other way!Make sure you install them as per the instructions though because they are not the same!Funny story...I was telling my elderly neighbor about them and she told me she got a set for Christmas once and put ONE on and kept the SPARE? one in the package just in case:) Gotta love her!
B000COC8Z4|5|As all of you Jeep owners know the original equip Jeep fenders fade to gray quickly and are next to impossible to restore.  The Bushwacker flares do not fade, they retain their true black color. The fenders are easy to install, the welt between the body and the fenders gave me the most problem but patience was rewarded. I especially like the 4 3/4\\" width. I have 10\\" tires and these fenders almost give complete coverage without sticking out too far like the 6\\" style. I almost tore off my stock fenders on a tree or a rock I don't remember which! By the way my Wife has a relative who is an Employee of Bushwacker. The Amazon price was as good as he could get, and the shipping was free with Amazon!!
B000636NCU|5|It works as it is supposed to do. I'll buy it again.
B00A8HT722|5|I have not used this item yet, however the quality and size are direct fit.
B002HRNP8S|5|Bought this to go in the back of my Jeep and it works perfectly! Holds everything from items that the picture shows to coloring books and toys for the kids. A must have!
B00332GMEK|4|Really like how they look on my 00 tacoma came with a couple pieces of double sided tape but I bought and added a lot more just to keep them from ever coming loose<br />Great price  only thing is they are not ribbed like the description but I like the smooth look and am glad they are not
B000LNTN2C|5|Just as described.  Happy with it.
B001EOV492|5|Just what I needed for the receiver I order with it. Just note that it does not come with the pin. Had to go to WalMart and pick one.
B000VKOD9S|5|Good item fit correct.
B003FBV8ZW|5|They get the job done.<br />Foam around eyes lets no particles in, only a enough air to keep them from fogging up.<br />They're perfect!<br />Great price compared to retail shops.
B009LS9FXA|5|Shipped in 3 days. Packaged great. Looks like the stock Mercury unit.. O-ring was supplied . Unit works great, and very quiet.  very glad I did not spend $400 on the stock Mercury unit.
B006JRJBM6|5|I got my apple logo stickers in great condition. The stickers are a little more bigger than the iPad stickers. After all their good for putting them on the wall, folder etc. Their the original white stickers from apple and I got 6 of them. I would recommend this if your interested on apple stickers.
B003SYB2I4|5|Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service. I would Definitely buy again and I would recommend to my friends
B0028SGK2O|4|Super fast shipping - as described - VERY happy?
B00BA2W6LS|5|Best money I ever spent . Gets me to work and back a total of 26 miles and 1 gallon of gas lasts me a week .
B00852684M|1|Total piece of S$%T. These are hilariously poor and do not work out of the box.
B008G61EX2|1|It is not going to work I thought I was going to receive a wiring for a roketa  RTK110 not what it is
B007UVSJMS|5|Perfectly describes me being a Dobe Mom.  Proudly displayed on my F-150 that she enjoys going for rides in with me. Easy to apply, looks great on rear window. Very happy with this.
B00SJBQA06|4|Great for the price. Adapters work poorly to actually keep them from just twisting with vibration and wind. Removed them wrapped the plug in rubber and now they hold perfectly and look great!
B000CNGS56|5|Love this strap.
B001GRSY0O|1|WEATHER TECH floormats ordered for 2007 Honda Pilot were a poor fit and the company would not accept a return! Every time I watch the cool commercial showing a tight &#34;laser&#34; fit, I get angry! I am saddest not for my money loss, but because they advertise as American made!! I had high hopes but there was an inch gap all around the edges of the mats! I continued to use the Honda issue mats in favor of the weather tech, the fit was that bad, despite that the company wouldn't allow a return! I am just now posting this review because we traded our '07 PILOT for a '15 CRV (The Honda Pilot was an excellent vehicle!) I have no idea about the current policy for returns at weather tech but they will never not ever get me to try another order! By the way, the new CRV's come with an optional floor mat set that is rubber, and fits incredibly snugly! I recommend them!
B005OZNZD0|1|Couldn't get them cut....wrong type of metal.....sending them back
B002XL2IG8|5|Quick delivery in excellent shape - correct quality product. Needed to hook up properly at ill-designed campsite.
B003SYP51E|4|I'm happy. It fit and it came quickly.
B003DL76OQ|4|It does not have the strongest scent but does emit a fragrent odor and is better than the bag smell. For the price I would recommend the product.
B004U3TCVQ|3|misleading picture there was no key included.  just lugs in a generic plastic bag but with a Gorilla sticker with replacement key info.  not real thrilled with this purchase other than Prime.
B00AFECQ7Q|5|Jacket is well made, great finish, fits wonderful and truly appreciate the removable liner as well as the ability to open vents.  Definitely a contender for all season riding.  If I had to do it all over again, I would definitely purchase this same one.  Hope this helps anyone considering purchasing this.
B002KO8YG6|2|fell apart on me.  Be very careful when first removing it from protective layer before applying it on another surface.  It is very delicate.  The middle finger fell off.. but it still looked alright which is why I'm giving it 2 stars.  If it didn't fall apart on me I would've definitely given this 5 stars.
B00F47YXAM|5|the product looks good,need to work in your QC,easy to install if you are familiar with this kind of kits,for a 10000k light it's a little too white.
B000ALBS0K|5|Fit perfectly and easy to install.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to replace the struts on there car.
B00KRQVWRW|5|great sticker with good color. Size is as expected.
B007P14NPU|5|(I purchased this through my wife's account with Prime shipping, so it won't show that I purchased it.)<br /><br />I tried this unit on a 2000 Jaguar, a 2000 Mountaineer, and a 2004 Honda, and it works fine on all of them.  I left it plugged into the Honda all the time.  For whatever reason it seemed to take 3-4 minutes after I plugged it in before I could pair it with my Android smartphone or Galaxy tablet.  But once I did it did exactly what it is supposed to do.  I never used the mini CD that came with it, as there are rumors it has virus's on it.  I used the Torque Pro paid app after testing it out using the free version, and it is worth the $4.95.  The more expensive versions of this scanner may be more reliable, but at this price it is worth trying.  Much cheaper and more convenient than the automotive code readers sold here and in auto parts stores.<br /><br />One car had a check engine light on, and it read the codes and linked me to the internet with suggestions of possible fixes.  Turned out to be a simple (but hard to reach) vacuum leak.
B000P70UQW|5|This stuff is amazing I just bought more oh & mine did come with hardener cream enough for the almost the whole gallon. I have filled some amazing holes from rust on cars/trucks with this. Saving tons of money with it. It can be a bit messy to apply with no back stop unless you get creative.
B00069CN2I|5|Mounted on 2004 Silverado Ext cab, 2WD - The mirrors fit well, no vibration, delivered fast, good quality and good looks.  What else do you want?
B007PLZGO2|5|The order came in right on time; no delays. - It was all that was expected; the description was clear and concise. - It applied cleanly, seems to be made of good quality material, and I feel it will last a long time. - My only wish is I could have this in a bigger size; on the back window of a Ram 1500, it is just a little small, but not enough to be significant. - It's great fun to see people behind you start to laugh and you realize it's because of this sticker!
B008OIQEG4|5|Very easy to work with, and it looks great.  Great satin black finish.
B00332GB6Y|5|Just what I wanted
B0093SUGPO|5|My mirror on my 2003 Tahoe was really foggy and had brown dots inside making it hard to see at night.  I ordered this mirror replacement and it was so easy to install.  My mirrors are heated, power and auto dimming with the turn signal and this is the perfect replacement.
B0074U7S9U|5|This is a very cool decal i love it for my suv it a high quality decal made to last
B004YHR4PO|5|got a pair of these for my moms RAV4 and they are a great deal,I have the exact ones in my Acura and they work and fit great
B00SV54LBK|4|Looks good on my '15 Wrangler. Just throw away the support braces and install the commercial electrical 1 inch mounting base and use zip ties to secure.
B002LGOEVW|5|Fits well and works well
B005NLQAHS|1|You can see canbus info like rpm etc, fault codes of Mercedes do no show.
B000T9LZDI|5|I used this on the barrel of a family heirloom .22 rifle with some light surface corrosion from improper storage. It did a very nice job pulling the rust & oxidation off the metal with surprisingly little elbow grease and am old t-shirt. Well worth the money!  The gun looks nice now, with a light coat of oil it looks like it's been in my safe the whole time.  Recommended!
B00CMYVS5I|5|Good Looking sticker. Nice quality.
B005ZWN5FU|5|Excellent
B000P0ZJHO|1|This item sucks period, looks like and heavy duty but material bends like a rubber band , not worth the money
B00DC6MOLW|5|Works great
B0041ED13E|5|I own a pair of flood's and a pair of spots and they work awsome together mine a are mounted on a 97 3/4 Chevy 4x4 and it put to its paces and the only thing I have ever had to replace is the plastic cover and a balist cues a tree broke the cover and I guess the impact on the tree shook it lose lol  and all the parts are avail. On there website  .john
B000UOBIZC|5|My motorhome weighs thirteen tons and has hydraulic leveling lifts.  Whenever I'm at a campsite that is so out-of-level that it's beyond the range of the lifts, I use these to cap my matching, stacked leveling blocks.  Thus far, they have survived the weight of my thirteen ton GVW coach without damage even in 95+ degrees F temperatures.  The photo I've uploaded shows the entire rear end of my motorhome being supported by Tri-Lynx blocks with the Tri-Lynx 00019 LynxCap.
B00HGGFZAG|5|Look like factory at a fraction of the cost
B00514CDZU|5|A+. I used the to extend out past the lowers on my Ultra. Nice chrome. Seems solid.
B000JFL7ZS|5|Works perfect on my Ford 6.0 diesel's oil filter housing.  Hopefully it doesn't rust away in a few years, no signs yet though!
B0068FYDC2|1|No instructions provided. Found a tutorial online that said to use rubbing alcohol to allow the grips to slid into place. Grips ripped both laterally and medially during installation. Disappointed, very thin and brittle plastic material.
B005C5E81U|2|it fits perfect, but its not heavy duty, the kind of money i spent on this cover, i was hoping that it would take the beating from heavy rains. unfortunately it does not, after the rain, when i take off this cover i see water on my bike and i don't like that. so for that reason i am giving this cover 2 stars. i will try some other cover. i can't even return it because i have used it. but won't buy it again. the whole purpose of this cover is to protect your bike from the rain and sun, but if its still leaving water on the bike then what is the purpose putting this thing on your bike?
B00AVQA98G|5|Installed this on my 4 cyl 1999 TJ. It has a front locker with 31&#34; tires. Easy to install. Soon to go rockcrawling.
B001EZACB2|3|Be aware that this hitch will fit the SX4 crossover ONLY.  It will not fit a sedan model.  It appeared to be well constructed and a nice kit with clear instructions.  The packaging was horrible, practically non-existent. Whenever it arrives expect to see a dinged up hitch sitting at your door.  Don't question where the box went...it doesn't come in a box!<br /><br />I rated it three stars only because Amazon took it back due to lack of fitment on a sedan.
B001FAGLMU|3|Great product, but had a few flaws, the first was the instructions on how to install or one of the worst instructions I have ever gotten and the other problem was the replacment bolts were not long enough to connect the brackets
B0002RQC6C|5|I wanted this product for my vehicle for a while now but it was too expensive. When I got the chance to buy it for less I was somewhat skeptical of quality. Upon recieving my grille in the mail I immediately installed it in like 15 minutes. Following the provided instructions it went on perfectly.
B009IKGY9Y|5|it cured my electrical connection problem.
B00O83SHL4|5|Installed easily. House fits perfectly in the stock position and plugged right in. Was originally worried about whether or not it would need a resistor to flash correctly, wasn't needed for my application works without it. Lights are very bright and there is substantial difference between the marker lights and the brake lights.
B00498N5O2|1|Replaced the belt on my 2006 Mazda 5 with this belt.  It started out squeaking every time the compressor kicked in. After a few months it now squeals like crazy.  I should have read the other reviews before purchasing.  I'm now buying a different brand belt.
B00FTV4CN6|5|Ordered some of these for me and some for my brother. Received them within a week of ordering them. Love how there are 3 different sizes to use. Thanks :)
B000EPL8PM|5|Worked perfectly and shipped fast!
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|worked great, very happy
B0007VU48K|5|Who would have ever thought a small battery could power a large daily driven car?  I use this in my 2010 Camaro SS that runs a 416 stroker motor and I drive that car almost daily.  I swapped between the ETX30L and the OEM battery and I do not see any differences.  The only issue are those you would expect from a small form factor battery:  attaching large automotive battery leads to it.  I used the JL Audio XB-SPTM side post to top mount adapters:  [[ASIN:B002F5CUJ2 B002F5CUJ2]] and at that point the only issue will be determining how tight to tighten the post adapter bolts.  If you think it's tight, it probably isn't, but at the same time you don't want to over do it.  Just get the cables on and then re-tighten till you cant move the cable is what I do.
B009PSS18G|5|I'm no Detailer Professional but when I saw what a pro did using the 3m Perfect-It system to remove some pretty nasty brush scratches from my Wrangler I knew I wanted this for my auto detailing at home - until I priced it all. Further searching landed me here and I'm glad it did.<br /><br />This system with the included foam pads is all I need for my semi-annual detailing. I use the orange medium cut pad with Meguiar's Ultimate Compound and gone is all the road grime and all those small scratches. I skip the Ultimate Polish with this car (using the black final finish pad) since it doesn't look to need it and hand wax with Ultimate Wax. The results were indeed stunning - in less than 3 hours. I've since ordered the 3-foam pad kit to add a red heavy cut and blue light cut pad in case I forget I might need them down the road.<br /><br />The polisher weight had me a bit spooked at first, but once the handle is attached it is very nicely balanced and once I remember to periodically run a brush over the pad while running to clean it when things begin to get burdensome, all goes quite well.<br /><br />The 8&#34; pads are perfect on the 7&#34; backing plate with the overhang allowing flex for tight places. My Detail guy recommended not to use the wool pad and stick only with the foam for a lot of disaster preventing reasons that sounded good to me. 1200-1400 rpm was his speed recommendation which doing the math is a 1-1/2 to 2 setting on the polisher adjustment wheel. He also suggested an nylon angle handle brush kind of like a toothbrush for cleaning residue off the pad while using that I got at the hardware store. Once done, he said just wash the pad with dish soap and it will last quite some time.<br /><br />The 3m system with a Dewalt polisher the detail guy uses is likely much better for use every day. The 40-something dollar polisher I watched on a YouTube review had a handle design I did not like and the motor sound was quite unimpressive.<br /><br />So now I have apolisher and polishing system that looks and works like the pros use at a price that's less than I'd pay with for just one visit to the pro detailer. I am indeed a very happy DIY auto detailer guy.
B000N3W8J0|4|Pretty straightforward, the idea is to keep grit out of your sponges while washing a car. It works well. It didn't fit the majority of the 5 gallon buckets I have, and would only go about 1/2 down the bucket before becoming stuck. This included buckets from HomeDepot, Lowes, AdvanceAuto, and PepBoys.  It finally fit an old 5 gallon paint bucket I had, may want to keep that mind when purchasing.
B006BAM5RE|5|Worked perfectly
B001GN6QQW|5|As described.
B000NBVFN2|5|Quality Product.
B00CTQT3J2|5|Original broke, great replacement. very easy to install
B00L6WEB3I|1|Says it comes with low and high beams and it only comes with low, didn't get the right color, doesn't come with all the wiring, I should be getting a new set in the mail thanks
B00062ZJ4O|5|Great wax for black cars.  So glad this product exists.  Applied by hand or with a random orbital buffer, it looks great.
B003CXA138|5|Thanks, fits like a glove and so far the outside cats haven't destroyed it!
B00829RHE8|5|Simply useful and practical and very effective in the prevention and safety brake system.<br /><br />Simplemente útil y practico y muy efectivo en la prevención y seguridad del sistema de frenos
B004UL5RUI|2|I am very unhappy about this product. I hope the company can fix this problem and responds to customer's complaints.
B0007INAU2|5|I bought this book because I've been having trouble finding anything about my car, it was a little more then I wanted to pay [being SO used] but it's an amazing book that is so helpful in working on the car.
B002AP95H2|5|Works great!
B00CFQUKTS|5|Worked well!
B00DXNGIES|5|Fits great. Looks great. Plastic with printed metal picture insert
B007QHQB3U|5|Thanks!
B00029XF74|5|no problems with it.  Priced right
B008C1TB3Q|5|Very good product and delivered on time, recommend this seller and this article.
B002969BQW|5|good cleaner.
B0054HNPDS|5|Did every thing I wanted
B000182DW4|5|Shipping was very fast. Shades installed perfectly with no problems. I have purchased other shades in the past and they did not fit properly, but these fit perfectly.
B0012Q9Z9I|5|Great price on these plugs. Hard to locate at local parts stores. Must use these plugs for certain year Rodeos. They arrived in 2 days with standard free shipping.
B006M2HI32|1|I read all the mostly positive reviews, and thought I would take a gamble. I should have had my old one rebuilt it worked better than this new one. I tried to adjust it to no avail. This is the problem with &#34;Made in China&#34; replacement parts. I was forewarned and wouldn't listen.<br />I would not recommend this product.
B002I1QC1U|5|Fit is perfect and install is easy. Just make sure you use caution when threading the studs in and use Loc-Tite. Don't over tighten.
B001C8WQWE|5|Top quality rotors, high carbon material, resistant to warpage and quality manufacturing
B004NIFBZE|5|I purchased these as a gift for my hubby, there were are a perfect fit.  He will be using these over his eyeglasses to wear on our boat to shield his eyes from wind as he pilots. I can't attest to the performance of these goggles yet. They appear to be quality goggles. They come with a white cloth bag for safe-keeping.
B0013FLAT6|5|Fit perfectly with no issues.  Excellent quality and no problems.  i did keep my spare for just in case.  Two thumbs up.  Purchased for the 6L80-Gt/g8
B009PIKISM|5|Exactly what I ordered.  Great product and price...plus it arrived in a timely manner...BIG THANX!
B0001EFSTI|5|hubby loved this surprise gift! Great price, fast shipping, well made item! Very practical
B000VU915Y|5|I bought this, in conjunction with some spray in bed liner, to prepare my pickup for a slide in camper.<br /><br />I presently have a plastic truck bed liner, which does a great job of protecting my pickup bed, at the expense of being painful on the knees when crawling around the back with my cap on.  The plastic drop in liner is also slippery--I've had a number of things fall out of the back of my pickup while accellerating--Christmas trees, a small boat, etc.  I elected to not cut out the corners to have access to the tie down points.  While I wanted to be able to tie things down, I did not want me pickup bed to get trashed.<br /><br />So I opted to change my drop in liner for a spray in liner and this rubber pad, while required to support a slide in camper, is also very easy on your knees when crawling in the back.<br /><br />I tried it first which the drop in liner as I could not remove it with my topper cap in place.  I found the rubber pad was tight and curved up a little.  I could tell it would be a perfect fit once the drop in liner is removed.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this product.  The price is reasonable.  I wish I bought it sooner. I think it will work well with the spray in liner, once I put that in.  I recommend the product and the combination of this product with a spray in bed-liner. In fact, I could probably skip the spray in liner--this is a good solution by itself.
B00KTHXBXM|3|Got a set of these to replace one I lost, had it cut to fit the car but it won't stay in the fob. There are notches near the tab on the original key that I still have one, but the notches are NOT on the replacement key. VERY disappointed that the key won't stay put in the fob.
B002SA2U30|5|Ok
B009FUFD1C|3|Not as &#34;plush&#34; as those from Sam's or Costco.  As described, smaller in size than those from Sam's or Costco.  Can I say &#34;thinner&#34;, &#34;not as thick&#34;?  Probably not buying again.
B005GOPC26|3|Great way to crank RV jack stands.
B00C2WLNB4|4|I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't like the cap and the o-ring on the drain will need to be replaced.  I use this as an aftermarket air-water intercooler for my supercharged truck.  Looks great and the price is awesome.
B0011Y1562|2|The front is not fit very well. If you have power mirror, the frame will cut into the paint. I have to push the frame back every week.  The back is ok.  However, if you roll down the window a bit (when it rains), it rattle so loud and constantly because the window will hit the frame.
B000KIMHRQ|5|good
B006RGFSHQ|4|Wife loves about anything with non pirate skulls..<br />she liked this for spare keys. well made, looks nice.<br />We got several others as well
B001DRP9G4|5|filters did an awesome job in the Benz-- going longer oci means needing a filter than can last/withstand the punishment.  these did a fine job
B004O5DSOM|5|Great
B000BYRHIS|5|Works as advertised, excellent for those of us who live where freezing rain/sleet/snow is a common ocurrence.
B009DJTOEM|5|I was very glad that I was able to find this part on Amazon.  Very easy to find and match for the correct vehicle.
B002BFTVI4|4|Chair is very light but very sturdy as well the only problem is the table on the side had issue with very heavy items the locking hinges are on upside down so can not hold heavy weight

B000ALBZK8|5|great stuff
B00EXWEPBQ|5|Great gloves that live up to the Arri name and quality in build and looks.
B008ND8GJ8|4|Worked as described but unfortunately was not error free, my vehicle is very sensitive
B0042Z0XWY|5|These are great.  They add a little style to your ride and that isn't the best part.  The little turds that try and steel these can't because they come with a little wrench that allows you to tighten them enough that you need the wrench to get them off.  This way you keep the wrench in your glove box and the turds can steal someone else's valve caps!
B009HLPA6C|5|Great looking on any lancer!
B001EFVAA4|5|Perfect, Thank you!
B001EHSUVE|5|Worked wonderfully on my 2010 BMW Z4.  Kept me from drilling the bumper.<br /><br />I used the bracket to fasten to the mesh of the BMW and then used the included bolts to secure the plate through the bottom holes in the plate.  I then used bolts to go through the top holes and backed them with rubber stoppers to eliminate vibration and avoid damaging the finish on my bumper.
B0006309WA|3|A lot better than factory head lights but the reason for only 3 stars is it has a cheep plastic lens and needs a real glass instead to make them better
B0063MI1DM|5|easiest install of every modification i have bought for the truck. 2 screws and done. Looks great, probably gunna buy a trailblazers sticker to match these bad boys
B004VXJFG2|4|Great storage for small things
B000H90XDS|5|works great.
B00M2SYXN8|5|Swapped out some 1/4&#34; steel cable on a small winch and had enough left over to replace my boat winch cable.<br />Tested to the max on a tree stump and a 1/4&#34; logging chain failed before this 1/4&#34; synthetic rope , impressed
B007V2BTV4|5|Over the years I've purchased sunshades for approximately 1/2 the price but typically don't use them because they are flimsy (collapse in the hot sun) and clumsy to use (a struggle to keep in the windshield and difficult to re-fold - those springy type sunshades).  This one is not only easy to insert into the windshield but it STAYS in place; the custom fit is perfect!<br /><br />I live in SoCal where it regularly gets over 100 degrees in the summer and this shade is the BEST I've ever purchased.  Even though it costs a bit more it is truly a value as it gets used (rather than relegated to the floor in the back seat).  I highly recommend this product.
