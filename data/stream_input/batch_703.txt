B000QUEQBS|5.0|I hope you are not looking for a movie that is a totally new storyline. This movie doesn't really dwelve deep into a story. It is actually quite political and for those paying attention their are some jabs at the current administration. I wont get into that part but it is there.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed was the almost constant action. It was intense from the get go without being overly violent. Mark Wahlberg is an excellent actor and that is evident here. The movie starts with soldiers on a top secret mission. Wahlberg is a sniper and his spotter gets killed in the first part of action. This causes Wahlberg to retire until he is called back into action by the US government.<br /><br />The movie doesn't get stale at any points and is constantly moving. You don't need to put much thought into anything that happens since it is explained well. The movie goes from location to location all over the United States and has a climatic almost predictable finish.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun action movie where you can get into the intensity this is it. I would say this is a must have for any action afficianodo. Also it's almost a must have for anyone with a home theatre set up.  If you have a blu-ray this is a must have rental if not purchase.
B0000009SY|5.0|I ordered the CD for my husband to replace a tired old tape he couldn't play anymore. He was so excited that it got here fast, and in great condition, it was like he was hearing it all for the first time. Like a kid in a candy store.
B000RJO578|4.0|One of my favorite movies is Shaun of the Dead.  That being said I expected more of the same with this movie.  After watching the movie it wasn't the same.  The physical comedy I enjoyed so much is not evident early on.  The comedy and banter is dry early on.  The action is rather lacking for the first hour.  Then when the movie heats up it really becomes a lot of fun.<br /><br />This movie is different and for those expecting an American type action movie you better turn away.  Hot Fuzz features a lot and I mean a lot of dry English humor.  It's good but don't expect any real laugh til your sides hurt moments.  Hot Fuzz is rather enjoyable if you approach it with an open mind.  The same main characters for Shaun of the Dead are here and the on screen chemistry is good.  This movie is almost unusual to be stranger than Shaun of the Dead.<br /><br />In the end I really liked this movie.  The acting is very good and action scenes are funny and intense.  The sound quality on my home theatre was very good and that helped add to the movie.  For any fan of Shaun of the Dead this is definately a must watch.
B000R9J3X4|3.0|While the band is still on hiatus, a greatest hits compilation had it coming. A band that went from nothing to something with a huge hit on \\"Garbage\\" and later on with \\"Version 2.0\\" prove that a  good band sticks for long.    It is certain that with a title like \\"Absolute Garbage\\" expectations are high, but this greatest hits falls short. Giving us seventeen out of the twenty-three commercially released singles I would not say this \\"Garbage\\" show its essence. Missing four excellent singles (Androgyny, Breaking Up the Girl, Sex Is Not The Enemy), no fan will get the best out of this collection.    The collection lacks the most experimental \\"Garbage\\" albums yet - \\"beautifulgarbage\\" and \\"Bleed Like Me\\" - but on the good side it brings the two Non-LP singles back to life \\"#1 Crush\\" and \\"The World is not Enough\\".    The Remix Disc works depending on what you looking for. This won't be your typical Remix CD where the singles would work for a dance club instead I believe the remixes lack the power to make the singles better.    This \\"Garbage\\" will go for a long way, but if there's something more your looking for I would suggest get each CD, since they really show what Garbage ultimately is.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I must admit that I honestly hate the book Pride and Prejudice.  The story seems to drag on for an eternity and I lose interest long before the book concludes.  My sister made me watch the movie, promising it was better.  I was very skeptical.  But, I now have to admit that I loved the movie!  It cut out all the long, boring scenes the book tended to dwell on.  The acting was great and the story was beautiful.  There are still some cheesy lines and a little bit of corniness, but it's a chic-flick.  That's to be expected!
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I really really loved this movie and i am very picky about period pieces such as this Victorian piece...This was a real treat!! I spent a Friday night in watching it and it was so worth it. The scenery took my breath away. At times, it seems dull and just white or plain dark but very beautiful at the same time! The exception is when they are in the glow of the firelight- their realm, their special place. The firelight freezes and captures their passion, their love and stops time for them. The title of the movie makes sense as well because the movie warms the heart and soul and stops time for those watching and wishing all the characters well! WAtch it, you will not regret it. A great movie to own!!
B000K4X2UQ|5.0|this live disc is killer. 1st disc is classic whitesnake at its best. 2nd disc is real close.the best line up every of the bluesey whitesnake. john lord is great on this disc.please buy you will not be unhappy!!!!!!!!!!!1

B00000I8UK|5.0|The first time I heard this album, it was such a pleasant suprise. I've almost never heard a jazz record so unique and pleasant. It's a very creative album that simply sounds good. It seems like it's Dolphy at his best. At least of what I've heard of him.    I do suggest you give this album a listen before you buy it though. It seems that there are a few people who see everyone getting all excited over it, and after they buy it, they realize their taste does differ. Hopefully, though, you'll enjoy this album as much as I do. One of my favorite jazz albums yet.
B000002KXV|5.0|This is the finest Album Donald Fagan ever did.    What amazes me is that it sounds so good and sounds so fresh it just makes me shake my head to think this recording is now 25 years old.    Interestingly, when this album was recorded it was done Completely digital which was rare at the time.  The only Analog was the mastering to Vinyl.    So since it was digitally recorded it was no problem taking this to CD format.  It sounds like it was always a CD.    Recording and musical performances are all  \\"FAGAN FLAWLESS.\\"    check this one out it really is the Desert Island CD.   I listen to this in the car on the boat and at home.  Never get tired of this.  25 years old?  Impossible.  25 Years Young.
B0002DB50E|5.0|Searching for logic in a Cronenburg movie can sometimes feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. You know there is a message somewhere, but it could possibly take forever to find it.<br />I think there are two questions this movie is asking it's viewers.<br />The first being; Why do people subject themselves to watching this kind of cinema and television?<br />And the second being ; What effect does this kind of cinema and television have on it's viewers?<br />In those questions themselves lies the answer; Depends on the viewer.<br /><br />Now that I've gotten all the phsycological stuff out of the way, lets talk about the movie itself.<br /><br />James Woods might possibly give the best perfomance I've ever seen in a horror movie, along with the rest of the cast. Everything in my opinion is absolutely perfect, from facial expressions, to hand movements, to dioluge, is just perfect in every way possible, and I could not ask for anything more.<br /><br />The special effects are mind-blowing. We have, pulsating TV screens, torture, a torso that eats (don't ask), multiple gun shot scenes, and one scene of a man literally melting that make Scanners seem like a kids movie. There is a lot more also that I won't go in to, but there is no shortage on gore, I can assure you of that.<br /><br />This Criteion print is, for lack of a better word, beautiful. There are two audio commentaries, one by the director and one by actors James Woods and Deborah Harry. A 40-page booklet featuring multiple essay's by film critics.  Featuretes on the special effects of Videodrome, and my favorite feature, a roundtable discussion with directors John Carpenter, Mick Garris, John Landis, and David Cronenburg from 1982 discussing horror films in general.<br /><br />This movie is extremely ahead of it's time, and although it was made in 1982, it feels like it could easily been made in the late 90's. This is without a doubt in my top ten horror films ever made.<br /><br />The fact that I'm sitting here reviewing a film with such passion that was made before I was born speaks for itself.<br />GO BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!before I was born speaks for itself.     GO BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural is the best, most underrated show on TV.  I like the fact that they settled some burning issues that have been going on for two seasons, and opened up some new ones which promise to make for a terrific third season.  I hope that I will be able to buy Supernatural the Complete SIXTH (or even TENTH) Season on DVD.
B000OY8NII|4.0|I love this series!  There is humor in every episode, and it's fun to see what might some day become possible.    My biggest problem with this set is that the case does not hold the disks in place.  This allows the DVDs to move around and rub against the case and possibly scratch.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|This is altogether a most satisfactory production. The music is very well played and sung, and the acting, together with very clear and understandable subtitles, makes the action easy to follow for a non-speaker of Italian.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I watched RPF last night.  This is a well directed, very moving story about 2 sisters and a cousin who were taken from their mothers because they were half cast (aborigine/white).  The girls were taken to a camp 1200 miles away that would indoctrinate them into the ways of white society.  The girls, led by 14 year-old Molly make an escape from the camp and WALK back home (about a 2 month journey I think), using the fence as a sort of compass.<br /><br />Well directed, well acted (the young girls are INCREDIBLE), beautifully shot, and a very engaging story.  The director's goal of making these kids YOUR kids was achieved as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Bravo!  One of the better films I've seen in many years!
0399229191|1.0|I love Eric Carle's art and several of his other stories, but this one is really boring and repetitive. There's not enough variety to the images, the spider comes across as a real pill who has no interest in other creatures, and the story line is dull. Skip this and go for the chameleon or caterpillar or polar bear.
1594489505|5.0|This book draws you in and you can't put it down until it's done.  I loved it.  I also read The Kite Runner and it's just as good...same author. This book gave me an understanding of the oppressed culture that I was ignorant to.  I have so much more respect for the women that endure life in that environment.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|not since the first star wars in 1977 has a sci-fi movie been this fun, and balanced excitement, action,  humor, and an ensemble cast so expertly. i give serenity the edge though b/c it's a smarter film, dealing with more philosophical/moral issues (tuskegee medical experiments, anyone?), while still being a whole lot of fun.      advice-- your enjoyment of this film will be increased tenfold if you take the time to watch the 13 or 14 episodes of the firefly tv show first.  that will make this film so much more significant, and will make it clear to you what an incredible achievement and victory it is.    if you already own the initial release of serenity, consider the following: universal hasn't ruled out the possibility of a sequel, despite serenity not making a profit during its theatrical run.  like firefly, the serenity dvd is selling so well that universal has put out this collector's edition. if this one sells well...well, i think you can figure out what might come next.  so, let's all see if we can do the impossible a 2nd time!    me, i'll be in my bunk.
0803731094|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves the book. I have to read it over and over! The images are wonderful, the story has rithm and is exciting. A hit!
0894803123|5.0|While I'm not the best cook in the world, even these recipes have turned out well for me.  I love this book and now I'm hooked on trying out new flavours.  They are easy to follow and definately great tasting and creamy.  I love the Oreo Mint especially.  When Summer rolls around here, I can't wait to try the sorbets.  This is definately one of the best dessert books I've bought and you don't ever need to get bored with options when there is more than 90 recipes to try.  Go get this and have fun in the kitchen.  It's great.
B0006GANN2|1.0|This DVD was very disappointing because it was not the full movie.  It ended in America with the Frenchman returning home.  The movie was much longer with Popeye Doyle going to to Paris to follow up on the case. The most exciting and important conclusion of the film was deleted.
0385522401|4.0|It's difficult to know just what to call this.  It's really not long enough to be a novel and bit too long for a novella.  The reduced trim size and generous white space makes the book seems longer than it really is.  The author poses this question:  can a first rank concert violinist find happiness with a a husband whose love of music begins with Chuck Berry singing \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\"?         By now, you've read enough about the plot from others so that I can skip over that.  McEwan displays his usual verbal skills through his meticulous choice of words.  Others have reacted to this book with words such as \\"sad\\" \\"tragic\\" and so on.  I think they missed what I consider McEwan's deadpan humor.  Some of the internal struggles between Edward and Florence are actually quite funny and I believe that that is the author's intent.  I think McEwan had a fine time writing this book.   As we read through the wedding night of these two virgins and their earlier lives through flashbacks, we can see that McEwan is really exploring a typical British theme:  that of class distinction.  Edward knows the names of all the flowers and shrubs and birds.  He is a man of the earth.  But he wouldn't know a Strad from a Guarneri from an Amati.  Florence's quartet plays one of the Razumovsky quartets so beautifully, that her teacher has urged her to pursue a career in that field.  Her group's Mozart viola quintet is superb.  Edward is too busy listening to Chuck Berry.         In many ways,this is a British drawing room farce.  I think that many readers don't get it.  That McEwan writes beautifully is beyond discussion.  The book is memorable for the characters, the sly humor and his depiction of British class rigidity.  Where it goes wrong, in my opinion, is in the ending and I really can't say more without giving away tne ending.
B000MZHW40|5.0|As usual hollowood does this blame america first game.  americans should not buy diamonds.! GET REAL.  I think it is ok for americans to buy diamonds, I donot think it is ok for the African Gov. to allow these SCUM BAG THUGHS TO KILL  innocent people. The african gov. employed mercenaries(i saw documentary), and they were effective in clearing out the scum, however, UN (the united nothings) were afraid mercenaries would become to powerful and said \\"NO MERCENARIES\\".   Hollowood destroys movies with their warped co-dependent thinking.  i enjoyed movie, actors were very good. however, i am sick  of the blame america first gang.
B00005JN0T|5.0|I, Robot is a sci-fi action movie that's supposedly loosely based on the short stories of Isaac Asimov. I wouldn't know how loosely since I've never read any of them but I didn't see anything wrong with the movie itself. It revolves heavily around Asimov's concept of the Three Laws of Robotics having unexpected consequences but also has plenty of action scenes of Will Smith fighting swarms of hostile robots so I'd think it's a good compromise between the stories of two generations ago and the needs of modern cinema.    It's the year 2035 and the city of Chicago is crawling with humanoid robots that do everything for everyone and are perfect at everything they do. I wonder how the American economy can still work. The robots are not sentient like in most other movies but are simply intelligent machines bound by programming to ensure that they are perfectly obedient and can never hurt people.    Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, the only person in the world who hates robots. He's investigating the death of Dr. Lanning, the \\"father of robotics\\". It seems to be a suicide but Spooner suspects a killer robot. Everybody thinks he's crazy but you can hardly blame him when robots seem to be malfunctioning all around him in spectacular and violent ways. Will Smith brings his own unique style of humor to the role but he does play it more seriously than most of his other movies. Bridget Moynahan plays Dr. Susan Calvin, a very serious psychologist who is annoyed by Spooner's irrational hatred towards robots. Surprise, surprise, there's also the stereotypical robot who can think for itself and even has emotions to complete the character trinity and give the audience someone to sympathise with.    I really liked the design of the NS-5 robots in this movie. Instead of being tin-men like C-3PO or androids like Data, they are something in between. Their slender bodies and translucent skin is very original and contrasts with their amazing strength and fighting skill. For human vs robot and robot vs robot action, this movie is right at the top.
0887307280|5.0|One of the best business books I have read!  I found it tremendously helpful at a time in my small business I needed it the most.  Michael Gerber gives clear \\"hands on\\" guidance that will encourage you to take your business to the next level and on.  This is a book to read again and again until you can recite it in your sleep.
B000000OPQ|4.0|While I love this CD almost from start to finish, the Style Council is an overlooked 80s band.... this CD contains \\"Shout to the Top!\\" which I always found as a good balance to this motivational CD.   From one ex-wrestler the movie is realistic, the CD is good for us 40 somethings trying to get back in shape.  Good luck and enjoy!
B000P0J024|5.0|I really enjoyed this new Wilburys collection, especially the DVD with the interviews and music videos.  Well worth the price paid.
B000LRY9PY|5.0|I'm very happy I got the 2CD set. Her covers of these great songs are truly unique and from them I was lead to discover other great artists--ex Editors. Of course her base album is great too. I'm really looking forward to her next release.
0618680004|5.0|I loved this book, the best one I have read in a long time (ever?).  There is nothing more refreshing than reading an opinion different from your own, that makes you question your own assumptions.  I especially enjoyed the part toward the end where Dawkins discusses the indoctrination of children.  \\"Parents should teach children HOW to think, not WHAT to think.\\"  I reccomend this book to believers and skeptics alike.
B00005JPCF|5.0|This is a great movie with humor and important messages about the environment.  There were too many \\"songs\\" for my taste, but the kids loved the music.
1400063515|4.0|As a follow-on to Fooled by Randomness, the Black Swan is a excellent, thought provoking work that raises questions that should be considered.  Nassim's style is interesting.    Definately worth reading!
1400097029|4.0|John Banville's lyrical novel, \\"The Sea,\\" was highly recommended to me, and it met my every expectation for a well-written, intriguing piece of fiction.  Though there is a story imbedded in the fanciful meanderings of the protagonist, Max Morden, it is slow to come amid his interior musings, and, as in any good novel, the crucial incidents are not revealed until late in the book.    The novel opens by the sea with a strange high tide with seabirds mewling and swooping, and the sea becomes a presence, as Max deals with disturbing crises in his life. His wife, Anna, has died of cancer, his grown daughter remains distant, and he is plagued by memories from his childhood summers spent on the Irish coast.  Max returns to the seaside town of his boyhood, remembering his own loveless parents, the enviable upper-class Grace family, Connie, the attractive mother, Carlo, the corpulent father, the twins, Max's playmates, Chloe and the mute, sometimes spooky, Myles, and Rose, the twins' nanny.    While the plot is rather thin, the reader is carried along with Max as he relives the traumatic incidents of his life, his adolescent awakening to love and sex and unexpected death, and his current struggle with grief and depression, from which his daughter, Claire, tries to rescue him.  But the reader is buoyed from this morass by the wonderful and uplifting imagery of Max's meanderings, the ever-reassuring presence of the sea, and the surprising revelations as the novel reaches its climax.  Banville's prose is a pure treat, and the novel's prize-winning power is evident on every page.
B00030590I|5.0|HERO is a like a beautifully choreographed epic dance [with plenty of stylized violence, as well as human drama].  The use of color and camera tricks is fabulous, and, the use of color to depict moods and set the atmosphere, is eye popping.  This really was reminiscent of Chinese hand painted screens, for me.  Some people have compared the retelling of the story (from three different perspectives) as similar to the approach of RASHOMAN (directed by Akira Kurosawa).  The question that remains for us is whether \\"Nameless\\" (Jet Li) is a ruthless murderer or a fearless warrior who has taken a stand for those castaways from the lower rungs of society.  The supporting cast is equally intriguing in their roles, and, the lines between good and evil become increasingly blurred through character examination and the reallignment of the angles of human manipulation. The story is as much psychological as it is action-packed.  I'm only sorry that I waited too long and only saw it on DVD.  This is one of those films that comes alive more on the big screen.  Director Zhang Yimou did a fantastic job and I am sure that this film will be honored for years to come.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|I picked this up today, on sale at Best Buy for $16.99...Plus with the Best Buy Edition, you get 2 collector's postcards featuring the art of Alex Ross.    The film is love it or hate it fare.  I happen to love it.  That's what gets the 4 stars.    The extras, while I enjoyed the one's they included, are completely lacking. I love the case the DVD comes in and is worth buying just for the sake of collecting.    I expect they will release another version next year with all the extras from the European release.  I get tired of all the versions the company's keep releasing o the same movies to make money!  I would die if Criterion would release a definitive DVD with a soundtrack CD packaged in, but don't see that happening since most people look down on this movie anyway.    If you like this movie, it's worth buying, until they release a more feature filled version, which I expect will happen, because they know suckers like me will buy it!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is an amazing series to share with the whole family.  We have thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Received this DVD a few days ago... I was blown away by Augeri's performance, a natural. Been listening to Journey since Perry joined, yes it's a pitty he had to leave the band, but Augeri is the best replacement one can ever hope for, so all you winers complaining about I don't know what, stop wining! Everything is superb, the old AND new guys (Augeri and Castronovo on drums). I even ripped the songs from the DVD and made a CD for my car, that's how much I liked it! So, if you like Journey, BE GOOD TO YOURSELF and get this live DVD, you wont go wrong here, period.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I love this CD!! As Drew Barrymore's character says in the movie, \\"it's full of wonderful melodic suprises.\\" It's a perfect blend of 80's and music from the 2000's. I only wish that the song \\"Invisible\\" would have also made it on the CD. All in all, it's a fun CD that get you dancing.
0099457156|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this Grisham novel. I thought the narration and storytelling were elegant and a cut above most mass market paperbacks. The book gave me a window into life in small town Mississippi and relevant racial and social issues during the 1970s. I appreciated that it wasn't your typical thriller. Like other reviewers, I will say that many Grisham fans probably won't enjoy this book, since it is so different from most of his legal thrillers. But I think Last Juror leaves no doubt that Grisham is more than just a fly by night bestselling author. He is actually a good writer.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore, the former Vice-President of the United States, delivers what could be the most important speeches of his life on a topic he's been researching for the last 35 years.  Through dramatic before and after photos and compelling flow charts, Vice-President Gore shows the devastating affects the Industrial revolution has done to the Earth.  He also shows how people in power are doing to try to debuke scientific data.  It seems like those who choose not to believe are those who elect to cause chaos (i.e. G.O.P. Presidents Reagan, Bush I & II, Christian Leaders.).  Like it or not, Global Warming does exists!  Everything we do effects the planet's future.  Regardless of what your political or religious beliefs, you owe it to yourself not just to watch, but to listen objectively.  What you do afterwards is your own doing!

Abundant examples and exercises.
B000G7PMD2|4.0|... the live Octavarium Orchestra really killed this album for me (when they were involved). And it hurts to say that, because I am huge fan. There were problems with pitch, maintaining tempo, clear technical challenges that the live orchestra could not pull off without sound like they were trying **really** hard to keep it together. I love that Dream Theater put both SDOIT and Octavarium in their set, but an otherwise solid performance was marred by the orchestra.
067003830X|5.0|This book challenges received wisdom about the irreversibility of brain and nerve damage.  It shows that limitations such as those caused by strokes, injuries, and learning disabilities can be reduced by effective exercise of the weakened neural systems.  Doidge writes in a very readable style, using effective repetition of his main points, such as \\"neurons that fire together wire together.\\"  Highly recommended for anyone who would like to improve or preserve the quality of their thinking processes, as well as parents, teachers, health care professionals, social workers, friends and family of those facing neurological challenges.
B000Q99EAC|5.0|I am a little confused about why the Amazon review page is suggesting I tag this movie with \\"sex, s and m, and dominatrix\\".  I can safely say the movie does not contain any of those things.  It does contain an inspirational story that continues the tradition of the earlier films while containing enough new twists to avoid becoming a pale imitation of them.      The story works on so many levels - it has all the action, but is more introspective of human life.  I think it is partly about reflecting on the events of the earlier films and forming a complete picture of a life, like the final volume of an epic.  I do not think it can be appreciated without viewing the first three movies, or at least the first two.  Rocky helps the next generation to find its heart while finding the will to move on with his own life.

0553103547|2.0|I ordered this title after reading everything I could find by Tolkien and Feist.  I disliked it so strongly that I gave up reading fiction for three years afterwards.<br /><br />Martin's emphasis on being \\"realistic\\" in a fantasy (an oxymoron, I think?) means that immersing myself in the story was like immersing myself in the petty strife and stresses of my real life.  There was no room for imagination, very little humor, no heroes, and no villians.  Instead, there are only small-minded people who spend all of their time either having sex or trying to betray and murder each other.  It's hard to believe their civilization would survive for generations if their leaders all behaved like whores and junkies.  All this plus the glorification of incest central to the plot does not provide me with the entertainment, inspiration, amusement, relaxation, or escape from reality I seek when I read a work of fantasy literature.  It simply is not the subject matter I would ever want to read in my free time, nor would I ever expect to see it presented in such a way in a fantasy epic.<br /><br />If this title was marketed as a work of \\"pulp fiction\\" drama instead of a great fantasy epic, I would not judge it as harshly.  Fans of daytime TV and more perverted romance novels should enjoy it.  On a positive note, the quality of the writing is quite high.  It is certainly far superior to the writing of the early Terry Goodkind book I received as a gift once - which I enjoyed only because I could not stop laughing over how poorly it was written.

B000LC55F2|5.0|I've seen this movie a couple of times now and really enjoy it.  This cast does a great job and gives excellent performances, but what really makes this movie for me is how it's constructed.<br /><br />The story is told from overlapping points of view, one inside of another, an obsession within an obsession until the end.  The beginning from the end, a rough and sorry journey that is well thought out, and delivered in a manner that gives homage to the immortal world as it unfolded from from the pages of Bram Stoker's classic tale.  This gives this movie its real punch and makes it stand out from contemporary storytelling.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|A friend and I saw 300 in theaters and we both decided that we absolutly had to have it on DVD when it came out. I was originally going to get it on regular DVD, but then about a week before it came out, I got a PS3.So i decided to spend the extra 5 or 6 bucks on it, and get it on blu-ray. I am so glad that I did because the special effects are so smooth and blend in more with the movie. It is a great movie and is even better on blu-ray. So just spend the extra 6 bucks and get more than the regular DVD option has to offer.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|I first watched the 2006 release Casino Royale in the theater.  I was very impressed.  The movie was unlike any Bond film I had seen before.  In fact, the movie is gritty in a way that resembles the very well made Bourne movies.  I recently watched the movie again, and found that it was even more enjoyable the second time around.  The changes, in my opinion are for the better.  I was a fan of Pierce Brosnan in the role of James Bond.  I thought that he had been the best Bond since Sean Connery.  I thought Roger Moore was okay, while timothy Dalton did nothing for me.  Craig made for a very compelling and very human Bond.<br /><br />The visuals in this film are stunning.  The usual opening scenes are - true to form - pretty spectacular.  Bond shows little mercy when it comes to resorting to violence.  He also gets hurt and bleeds on numerous occasions.  He seems ill at ease in a tuxedo, but seems to adapt to the role.  The primary setting for the movie is an incredibly picturesque Venice.  The film features really stunning scenes with some excellent stunt work.  The Blu-ray version is without a dount the version to watch. Clocking in at 144 minutes, the movie seems to fly by with its fast paced story.  The only downside to the film is that the villain came across as pretty tame for the most part.  There probably could have been a bit more done to make him really evil and dislikable.<br /><br />Overall this is a strong 4 star movie that is well-worth the price of the movie.

B000OQF6N6|5.0|This album really surprised me. I was truely expecting some pseudo-garbage like Zwan was, but holding on to hopes of a real Pumpkins revival. I heard \\"Tarantula\\" and became optimistic. I got the album, and with a couple exceptions, this album is absolutely fantastic. \\"United States,\\" while interesting, seems to drone on forever (and at over 9 minutes, it really does). \\"Pomp and Circumstances\\" is way slow, and in my opinion boring. The other 10 songs, however, are nonstop good times. This album, as a whole really evokes a bit of the spirit of each of the Pumpkins' best albums (Gish, Siamese Dream, and Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness). Billy's voice, while still retaining the distinct raspiness, has a new \\"sing-song\\" kind of quality to it that I've never heard before. Songs like \\"Doomsday Clock,\\" \\"Tarantula,\\" and \\"Starz\\" really keep the album (along with many of my days) rolling on. This album is fantastic, and I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has ever liked the Smashing Pumpkins before.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|Much like \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\" and \\"Dawson's Creek,\\" \\"The O.C.\\" is one of those series that is a true time capsule from the years of their broadcast.  The show was made for the generation of teens and young adults growing up in the beginning of the new millennium.  But unlike it's predecessors it wasn't aimed solely at teens, but at their older siblings and parents.  This is what set the series apart from the competition, and why it's first season was FOX's # 1 series.  Creator Josh Schwartz (almost fresh out of USC film school) created essentially a John Hughes-isq television show (if Molly Ringwald was 30lb thinner and had a no-limit Amex Card).  But the pop-culture quirks, loveable characters, and rich/beautiful sets was what made \\"The OC\\" the place to be.    The First season starts when Sandy Cohen (a Public Defender) brings his newest client, Ryan home for the weekend to his posh Newport Beach House.  After a series of random events Ryan is adopted by the Cohen's and the first season follows his fish-out-of-water experiences learning the ins-and-outs of Rich society, and all the secrets that come with it.  But events conspire outside of his control as he and his new brother, Seth, shake up the popularity Hierarchy at their High School.    The Second season takes the storylines and remaining characters from the first season and basically continues' their story's but with adding a lot more drama, subtracting some of the humor, and bringing 4 new characters into the mix.    Season three is where the show lost its direction.  Having lost almost 40% of its main characters, and completely abandoning the comedy in favor of almost unrealistic soapy drama a dry spill hit `The OC' from which the show never truly recovered with the ratings and the critics.  But if the third season did anything it show's the gangs graduation from high school (IMO in the best Graduation Scene ever to be filmed) and the death of a major characters that allowed the producers to complete re-tool the series in season 4.    Season four was more or less a renaissance for the series.  The creator returned to the show full-time (after a year hiatus) and the intense drama was dropped pretty early in the season in favor of some much need comedy that returned the show its quirky roots.  But unfortunately this wasn't enough and the show was cancelled; although the producers were given enough warning to write a finale that successfully and very-welly wraps everything up!    This DVD collection includes all 92 episodes on 28 discs.  All special features from the previous releases have been carried over including two-discs of `bonus content' and the first season is remastered in Widescreen for the first time!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|the first time i watched this movie...i could not stop laughing from the beginning. i came out with my side aching from laughing and my mouth hurting from grinning. i watch it the other day and eperiance the same reaction. this movie is a must see film for those who enjoy the wayan brothers and for those who watched 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'  and 'Scream'. Watching this movie makes you laugh instead of scream when you do get around to wacthing these horror movies again. Get this movie you won't regret it!!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Just purchased Planet Earth today on HD DVD. I have an HD DVD A-2 player connected to my sony sxrd. This film is just glorious. I have just completed watching disc 1, and there are three more. I had a choice to choose out of buying it in HD DVD or Bluray. HD DVD has always just looked that much better to me. And this is by far the best. I also have the Matrix on HD DVD, planet Earth is simply the best. If your looking to get into HI Def movies HD DVD is a greast way to get going. It's inexpensive and glorious...
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Suffice to say that \\"Zodiac\\" is not for people with a limited attention span or for people who get their jollies from watching scene after scene of brutal murder, it stands as one the best movies of this year.  If you're willing to commit yourself for three hours and are looking for something more than just another \\"what a sick f**k!\\" film you're in for a disturbing, almost uncomfortably involving ride not through the mind of a killer, but through the mind of more or less innocent people who are torn apart by their inability to find him.<br /><br />I wouldn't call David Fincher a \\"great director\\" quite yet, but he's getting there: this movie proves that he isn't he just another renegade from MTV who got his hands on a camera.  Keep in mind, though: this is nothing like \\"Seven\\". (And fortunately for everyone it isn't anything like \\"Panic Room\\".)  That was more a work of dark imagination than anything else; this is horribly factual and only leaves a little bit out as far the actual case goes.  Robert Downey Jr., Brian Cox, Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal especially give very human, believable performances--almost to the point where you forget you're watching a movie.<br /><br />The Zodiac Killer was an erratic, power-minded psychopath whose reign of terror in Northern California is remembered very well by those who lived through it.  His reign of terror lasted from the late 60's to the early 70's, a fairly brief period of time for the average serial killer: but the Zodiac seemed more interested in playing power games with law enforcement--Mark Ruffalo plays David Toschi, the stressed out cop who had the misfortune of having to handle the case, and though most of the Zodiac's \\"codes\\" and messages seem at first to be directed toward ridiculing his status as a police officer, he keeps his cool as much as possible.<br /><br />Toschi was a tough cookie though, and a trained police officer.  Such was not the case with the Zodiac's more vulnerable prey, played by Robert Downey Jr. and Jake Gyllenhaal.  One is a reporter for the SF chronicle, the other is a cartoonist who should really have nothing to do with the case at all.  The Zodiac, with the sadistic sixth sense characteristic of murderers, lock onto both the these men and slowly suck the joy our of their lives while making them paranoid, fearful, and terminally obsessed with identifying the killer.  Spending their time getting drunk and trying to crack the puzzles sent in after each murder, the incomprehensibility of the situation brings them both to the brink of madness.<br /><br />Downey's character is already a little vulnerable (and he was great in this movie, people just slander him constantly because he's had very public substance abuse problems in my opinion) and frustrated.  He becomes non-functional and cracks while Glyenhaal's Robert Graysmith lets everything else in his life go to hell while pursuing the Zodiac long after the case is closed.<br /><br />The violence in this movie is more minimal than one would expect considering the subject.  There is one unforgettably horrifying scene with a couple who the Zodiac murdered in a SF park.  It is filmed with such distance and nonchalance that it chills right to the bone. No suspenseful music, nothing; just cold blooded, random murder.<br /><br />This does film does not have a happy or satisfying ending at all.  This is appropriate because the case did not have a happy ending; Arthur Lee Allen, a convicted child molester and a man of other blatantly deviant tendencies, is generally believed to have been the Zodiac.  He succesfully evaded capture and suffered a heart attack before he was formally charged with killings.  The last scene, in which Robert Graysmith finally gets what he wants and stands face to face with him, is in some ways more bone chilling than anything else in the film.  The expression on Allen's face is indescribably awful and smug.<br /><br />These killings took place in a time when some very basic technology was lacking in terms of law enforcement.  I doubt this could be pulled off with such evil braggadacio in the contemporary world, but the damage is already done.  The thing that concerns about movies as well done as this one is that they are based on actual cases, not even slightly distanced from real names and events.  It resurrects events--artfully--which certain diseased minds may want to recreate.  Not to say movies like this shouldn't be made, I certainly enjoyed it, but I sometimes think it would be better if aliases were used with respect to the people and suspects involved as a cautionary measure.  At any rate, a not just good but great film.doubt this could be pulled off with such evil braggadacio in the contemporary world, but the damage is already done.

Immediately after breakfast they wanted me to begin reading and when their parents walked in the door on Sunday night we were on the last chapter.  What a treat - for adults and children alike.
B000OY8NII|5.0|and was significantly impressed enough to buy the series on DVD.  I consider myself a \\"hardcore\\" science fiction fan, and although the series can be flippant at times, it has entertaining plots that are just slightly beyond what is attainable through current technology.  There is also an interesting subplot involving a \\"Tachyon Accelerator\\" which involves the first two and last episodes of the first season, as well as beyond; one is never sure of the ulterior motives of Henry Deacon (Joe Morton) as he mourns over his lost love as the series continues.    Conspiracy Theorists would love this series, as it deals with one small town in the Northwest being the source of all technological progress.

While the descriptions and info on the shoes are pretty scant, the pictures more than make up for that. The best part of running through this book is getting hit with the nostalgia that comes with seeing so many products from the not-so-distant past. A nice modern coffee table (or ottoman, I suppose) book. Air Max 1s are the best shoes ever.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|I have to admit when I first put the album in my car, it definitely wasn't what I was expecting. This is definitely not your typical Linkin Park. A lot of people are disappointed because this isn't the Linkin Park we are used to hearing.<br /><br />Through all this, Linkin Park definitely knows what they are doing. They have created an album which is a classic in its own right. \\"Given up\\" is where they left off on the last labum and \\"Leave out all the rest\\" is what the new album caters to. \\"What I've done\\" is one of the best tracks on the album. \\"Hands Held High,\\" is honest and the marching beat makes it even more interesting. Has Bush heard this one?<br /><br />In this album Linkin Park has definitely matured. They have done some of the most deep songwriting. The album definitely seems to put them on  \\"Adult Contemporary\\" but if you listen closely to other tracks, they haven't mellowed down much.
0743496728|1.0|This was a complete waste of time; I only suffered through all 455 pages because I kept hoping against hope that it would somehow redeem itself at the ending.  I read on other reviews about the \\"surprising twist\\" at the end, but I figured this out about 3/4 of the way through the book.  Not much of a twist.  Not only does the author lack basic knowledge of the legal system, she also doesn't know very much about teenagers.  The characters are cartoon-like, and the entire novel is episodic, like a bad TV crime show.      I should have heeded my usual prejudice against buying books with huge glossy pictures of the author on the back cover!  This book is manipulative in so, so many ways (and not even cleverly so!)
0743496728|5.0|This book is awesome! It really makes you stop and think about what is going on in the lives of our children. As a mother of two teenagers, this books hits home and makes me wonder what their lives are really like at school and how many kids that go to school with them are being treated like this everyday. We need to stop and take control of our kids and make them realise that it is o.k. for everyone to be different, but we do not need to draw attention to that fact nor do we need to tease and torment them.

B00005JKZ3|4.0|After successfully saving the planet from a deadly alien threat and raking in big money at the box office, the boys at 'MIB' were livin' the good life and enjoying all the perks of being beloved by moviegoers. Which is probably why Columbia Pictures felt the need to bring more intergalactic action and hilarity to the masses with a sequel to the highly popular film with the hopes of starting a franchise. So, 5 years after their first big screen adventure, Agent's K and J (Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith) are back again to save mankind from the worst scum of the universe, in Barry Sonnenfeld's \\"Men in Black 2\\".    \\"Men in Black 2\\" finds Agent J (Will Smith) having a difficult time keeping partners while protecting the Earth from alien threats. After he de-neuralized his former partner/mentor Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), J feels he's better as loner agent than partnered up. However, when a deadly new threat comes to Earth in the guise of a lingerie model (Lara Flynn Boyle), J and 'MIB' must bring in the one agent who will stand a chance of stopping this threat and saving humanity once again, Agent K. The only problem is, he doesn't remember anything about his life in 'MIB'.    What happens when a movie is so successful that it makes tons of money, turns its young lead actor into a mega-star, and catches audiences completely by surprise with how good and unique of a movie it was? Well, the obvious answer would be to make a sequel and cash in on the original film's success, which is exactly what Columbia Pictures did. However, there is a slight problem with this plan, how do you top what's already been done? The surprise factor is gone, the freshness has worn off, and it's possible that due to the mediocre animated series that was spawned from the original movie has diminished people's interest in the series.    To solve their possible problems Columbia Pictures brought on two writers that can handle the type of material needed for this type of movie, meaning plenty of action, humor, and sci-fi fun. Next, the powers-that-be managed to convince the main cast to reprise their roles from the first film, and lastly bring back the director that made them successful in the first place. So, did Columbia's plan of action work for this film or was it to fall prey to being yet another inferior sequel in an already long list? The answer, mostly yes, but there were some issues with the movie.    The cast was excellent, which isn't surprising given the talent assembled here, but as much as I enjoy Will Smith in most movies he makes, at times he actually felt boring to me here. I understand that the goal was having his character in the place of Tommy Lee Jones' at the beginning of the movie, being the serious career agent, no longer the care free rookie, but he came off like he was bored, leaving his performance feeling stiff. Now, I will say that once Tommy Lee Jones' character was back in play, Will Smith lightened up and the movie quickly picked up and felt more like the original, but the early part of his performance does put a bit of a damper on things. Tommy Lee Jones returns to playing the role that he does best, and apparently it's the only role he knows how to do, the no-nonsense serious man with a mission and a really dry, subtle sense of humor. Though the schtick is the same as before, it's still fun to see these two characters interact on screen, easily erasing the crappiness of the children's animated series. The supporting cast was solid throughout, I did grow tired of Johnny Knoxville's character, but he did provide some humorous moments. The rest of the cast was fun, and giving more screen time to Frank the Pug and the 'Worm' guys was a nice touch.    The story was a good follow-up to the original, with plenty of humor, though not as much as I'd hoped for before Agent K returns, but still the jokes were funny. The action was energetic like before, though a little more over-the-top in places than even the previous film had done, andthe sci-fi elements were inventive. However, with all that being said, the story did suffer some from the fact that it had lost its freshness and originality since the first one was so much of a surprise and audiences didn't know what to expect, but this time we had a pretty good idea. Honestly it didn't matter what anyone did in this movie, no matter what was tried they just couldn't match the original, which is unfortunate since the characters are so fun and story potential is everywhere, but in the end you still can't do better than what's come before. This is actually one of those rare cases when the potential for a sequel is there, but the studio should avoid going through with it for the simple fact that you most likely won't be able to do better than what you already have done.    \\"Men in Black 2\\" is still a fun movie, though not as good as the original, but that doesn't mean the movie's not worth seeing or owning. Yes, there are some problems with this movie in some areas, but most are overcome early on, leaving audiences with a rather enjoyable movie experience.    \\"Men in Black 2\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.

1400063515|5.0|Taleb's book is a fascinating look at the limitations of our knowledge as a  species - and our incapacity to factor these limitations into our thinking.  His core idea, that big events that are unpredictable by definition matter  most in the worl, and that consequently much of the businesses of forecasting  and predicting is largely useless - has profound consequences.  This is a  disturbing message bound to anger some, but also a liberating one -- don't  sweat what you can't control, focus on what you can, Taleb argues.   And  Taleb explores the many folds and nuances of his idea in an utterly engaging,  erudite, often hilarious way.  The style of this book is unique, often  self-deprecating, generally impassioned.  I couldn't put it down.  It's a  book that makes you think, and think about the world in a fresh way and  there's an \\"aha!\\" insight on almost every page.
1862303495|4.0|This book was stongly recommended to me, so I was very eager to start reading. Pretty soon I was wondering if I was reading a childrens book. Everything is described though the eyes of the young boy and that keeps the language very simple. In my view a little bit too simple at times and I find the adventures the boy describes not particularly interesting, but the seriousness of the whole situation of course does make you think. At times I considered stop reading this book, but in general I never really do that, because you can only judge a book on the entire story. That is definitely true for this book, because the ending is what made it for me. This is one of those books that you finish and you can then just sit there trying to understand what just happened. Just because of that I will definitely recommend this book. The ending does also leave you with mixed feelings. On one hand the father gets what he deserves, but in the end the boy (how naive he also may be) is just an innocent child in this case.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|After a failed suicide attempt, Frank finds himself living with his sister's family.  His sister, Sheryl, seems to be the only sane member of this dysfunctional family.  Well, maybe I'll include Olive, the family's youngest.<br /><br />Sheryl's husband is a motivational speaker, who is trying to get his book published.  Sheryl's oldest, Dwayne, is a determined teenager who has vowed to silence until he enlists in the Air Force.  Living with the family is Sheryl's father-in-law, who has been evicted from a retirement community for doing drugs.  He coaches Olive on her competition.<br /><br />The movies focuses on slightly plump Olive and the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.  This all starts when Olive gets a call that the regional winner has stepped down.  By default as the runner-up, Olive gets to compete in this envious competition.  In response, the entire family drops their plans, band together in a VW bus and travel through a few states for the pageant.<br /><br />One may think that there's nothing exciting that occurs during road trips.  Not with this family, they are THE poster family of dysfunctionality.<br /><br />All I can say is that if you like family dynamics no matter how chaotic they can be, then you'll enjoy *Little Miss Sunshine*.  My favorite part was when Dwayne has a meltdown, forces the family to pull off the road and storms off in a field.  Everyone in the family tries to coax him back but with no success.  However, as a last resort, Olive comes to her brother and just simply rests her head on his shoulder.  There's something special about that bond because he comes back.<br /><br />The pageant is a little freaky especially if you have never seen the kind that Jon Benet competed in.  Get ready to be shocked.<br /><br />Anyways, no matter how chaotic this family is, they still manages to remain a close one especially in support of Olive's competition.

It's all a true story.

Had to send the first set back because there was no volume at all in places.  The new set has the volume but places where the music is so loud you can not hear the narator at all. Other places where it is all to low and others where it is too loud. Don't know why they would let this epic to be ruined by lousy audio.

1428156585|5.0|I listened to the audio version and Ayaan did a superb job, took her time, pronounced the words clearly, and distinctly, and with expression.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali is to be greatly commended for her courageous story.  The practice of excision is done by ignorant and cruel people enslaved by their backward superstitious beliefs. The same can be said for the practice of \\"Honor\\" killing. If premarital sex is such a taboo then it is the men who should have their private parts sewn to their belly buttons.  The problem is that both Islam and Christianity are male dominated religions and they both denigrate women.  Islam just happens to be the worst offender. I hope that Ayaan has plenty of protection because many from the \\"religion of peace\\" (right!) will kill anyone who says otherwise. The adherents are constantly proving themselves to be people of violence and not of peace. So too, the good Christians, in the US, who think their country never does anything wrong while the politicians they support murders innocent civilians, in other countries, in order to steal their resources...(eg: oil).  read: \\"A Century of War\\"--William Engdahl.        \\"The Secret History of the American Empire\\"--John Perkins

I'm sure there are flaws, but nothing sever enough to interfer with my love of the stage show.  Some new added scenes, but they help tie everything together in a movie version of Phantom and don't interfer.
0316067598|5.0|Every American should read this story.  I say story because it is far more than just a book.  This story is a true testimony of the human spirit, and friendship that is enduring, that death can never change.  The true measure of success in life all to often is money, material possessions and star status.  These are the real heroes that youth needs to look to.  Those who sacrifice everything, putting their lives on the line for all of us.  Obviously,  Marcus and his Seal teammates, and all of our Service men and women know no borders when it comes to serving their Country and humanity.  There are no words that can adequately convey the graditude that we all should have for Marcus and his friends who sacrificed so much, all of our service men and woman deserve our constant thank you, respect, admiration and love.  It was great to read that 3 of the 4 received the Navy Cross and Mike the Naval Officer may be considered for the Medal of Honor.   God Bless them, grant them peace, and may God Bless America!
0375947221|5.0|This tale gripped me immediately as an exciting adventure story built around the remarkable Lyra, a young heroine so simultaneously splendid and rough... her naive, emerging femininity so credibly balanced by innate wisdom and clear seeing... so instinctively cautious and yet so capable of recklessness... so able to apply and also withstand her own self-criticism... so much the daughter every man's soul dreams of.  Later in the story we meet Will, who embodies all the complementary mythic heroism we would ever want to see in a son... but painted into a surprisingly believable picture of a normally conflicted 12 year old boy from the 21st century.      I suppose the most enduring theme and the basis for the subtle beauty of this work lies in the exquisite psychological BALANCE that is found everywhere... although not obviously or early on in most cases.  Opponents are ultimately balanced to one another in the endless struggling, but the outcomes are sometimes tragic and often disappointing as they are in life.  Slowly we see and eventually come to trust that tools and weapons are perfectly soul-balanced and psychologically suited to their possessors. Still, we are never quite sure how the fight will go.     This is a dangerous story to read with kids in some ways because the child characters are so powerful and allowed so much sovereignty... and yet that is precisely how it captures and holds any reader Lyra's age or older.  All together, the dizzying array of characters comprise a pantheon... a mythological representation of one whole human individual... and of his or her endless battle, first to know then achieve a degree of benevolent mastery over him or her SELF.  It's the story of dawn of creation... the falling away of innocence... the ascent... the purifying struggle... and the mysterious subtle marriage of opposites in which the Self is finally discovered and ultimately \\"redeemed\\"... but probably not in the way you'd expect.  Thank you Mr. Pullman, for a wonderful tale.  My hat's off to you, sir!
0792833201|5.0|I've loved this movie ever since I saw it in the theatres.  It's creepy without being gross or vulgar.  Spoilers ahead, so if you've not seen the movie, stop here.  I love the way it starts out slow, with just a few minor creepy details, such as sliding across the kitchen floor, or the \\"TV people\\".  Who could ever forget the creepy tree or clown (YIKES!)?  Then it picks up with the disappearance of Carol-Ann.  Who could forget the classic lines, \\"There, here!\\" and, \\"Go into the light, Carol-Ann.\\"?  Also, how many scary movies are out there that are well-done where no one dies?  \\"Watcher in the Woods\\" is another great example of creepy without vulgarity or death.  The sequels are cheesy, leave out the character of Dana (the actress was murdered after this movie was made), and betray the plotline of this movie.  So, as far as I'm concerned, this was the only poltergeist movie.  This movie's timeless, and the special effects are still good by today's standards. Nice effects without CGI; well-done indeed.
B000002GYI|5.0|After several years on hiatus and a change in labels, Kraftwerk released the prophetic \\"Computer World\\" in 1981. There is a kind of double-irony involved with this album; at the time, it was seen as a tongue-in-cheek view of Kraftwerk's prescience about the computer and electronic revolution, now it seems like they were telling the future.<br /><br />\\"Business. Numbers. Money. People. Computer World,\\" droned the hummable title track. In the years before the proliferation of the world wide web, this kind of all-emcompassing Microsoft/Orwellian electrnic interlock all just seemed like flights of fancy. At the very least, fodder for novelty dance tracks (which both \\"Pocket Calculator\\" and - in one of the most unusual hit 12-inch remixes ever - \\"Numbers\\" became). Like the previous \\"[[ASIN:B000007R1M The Man-Machine]],\\" the four human members of Kraftwerk were lovingly mixing their human-hearted music with the image of themselves as automatons, whose credo was \\"I program my home computer, beam myself into the future.\\" In a world that had seen the likes of Devo, whose shtick was greatly influenced by the likes of \\"The Man Machine,\\" \\"Computer World\\" carried with it an air of vindication.<br /><br />After all, if \\"are we not men\\" could become a rallying cry in the era of New Wave, then \\"It's more fun to compute\\" was Kraftwerk's obvious answer. Little did any of us know that \\"Computer Love\\" would all but become the world of \\"My Space.\\" There are a mere six songs on this CD, and not a moment is wasted. I consider \\"Computer World\\" to be an album that altered the course of much that followed. There were so many that had already been influenced by Kraftwerk (think Ultravoxx, Human League, Thomas Dolby, et al), that having \\"Computer World\\" become one of the group's best selling (and best overall) album is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />It really deserves a remaster, along with the rest of Kraftwerk's classic albums ([[ASIN:B000007R1M The Man-Machine]], [[ASIN:B000087HXN Trans-Europe Express]] and [[ASIN:B000002GZ4 Electric Cafe]]).[ASIN:B000002GZ4 Electric Cafe]]).

I thought perhaps the book would help me create my own reminders, based on my schedule, and give me a hard copy of the information on her web site.<br /><br />It does that, however it is full of typos, poor grammar, and is extremely poorly edited. I am consistently disappointed to see her books, as well as Leanne Ely's, published in such an amateur way.<br /><br />I also must add my agreement with another poster regarding the website and many of the \\"reminders\\" you receive with her system.

That adds to my overall disappointment with the books and the system.
1594489505|5.0|I was more than a little disturbed by this story, starting right off with the first few pages.  But it had the ring of truth to it and the author is highly respected... so I let him carry me further into this darkly beautiful but conflicted world.  Eventually the humanity began to show through the meanness and struggling... even of the most primitive characters who are so easy to despise... to hate... whose deaths almost inspire applause.    Somehow this violence and harshness was eventually drawn back like a veil... letting me glimpse the breathtaking beauty that forms the bedrock of Islamic culture just as it does in Christian and Judaic worlds... because all cultures represent the core of a common humanity.  Until the American heart is able feel the essential beauty of this mysterious culture, our nation will continue to have difficulty understanding our [apparently unconscious] need to engage it as The Enemy.  Mr. Hosseini has helped me to understand on a feeling level that we are not really very far apart from other struggling humans... and that perhaps our most daunting struggles are with ourselves.  Thank you, Khaled.  This helps a lot.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|NEW REVIEW in 2017<br /><br />It was a nostalgic film in 2006 when the wars started by George W. Bush in Afghanistan and Iraq were turning stale and sinking in the quagmire of all colonial and imperialistic wars. It was of course a comment on these wars like when Edward Wilson says “We are trying to make wars small.” That is sure right if we can say so without sounding sarcastic, even at the time. They were in the process of getting their fingers into Vietnam after the defeat of the Bay of Pigs and Cuba. Of course far worse was to come, precisely Afghanistan and Iraq. They financed Al Qaeda in Afghanistan against the Soviet who pulled out rather fast. And now the USA have to face them and some dissidents or alternative factions in the fields George W. Bush decided all by himself and like a big boy to invade.<br /><br />That was a time when intelligence was important against Hitler but they met with Soviet spies in Germany and they did not necessarily have the upper hand. In fact, they were infiltrated very early after the war and in spite of what the film implies, that was not the cause of their lack of success and their future failures. They failed because the objective was wrong: they wanted to manipulated governments and states in other countries, hence their objective was imperialistic and that went against the grain of history that was witnessing the fall of all big colonial empires and the withering of any kind of imperialistic ambitions. They also went against the grain of the new phase of our human development that was and still is based on economic growth and welfare state policies.<br /><br />But the film shows far too well that the life of such spies is not a human life. Far from home, far from wives and children, entangled in all kinds of affairs and constantly the target of rival spying factions that try to get some information and leverage over you by getting something about you that should not become public (blackmail) or by menacing your spouses or your children.<br /><br />The film is well performed by seasoned actors though the shifting in time is at times difficult to follow in spite of the places and dates given now and then, though not all the time (where is the scene in Africa: Ivory Coast or Congo Kinshasa?). The most difficult problem was simply Matt Damon who was running in the film from the late 30s to the early 60s and he really was the same man not looking in anyway younger when necessary and older when needed. It is surprising because nowadays the make-up department of any studio can do a better job.<br /><br />At times here and there we have some extremely arrogant and irritating remarks that are supposed to be pieces of humor like the following:<br /><br />Richard Hayes: I remember a senator once asked me. When we talk about &#34;CIA&#34; why we never use the word &#34;the&#34; in front of it. And I asked him, do you put the word &#34;the&#34; in front of &#34;God&#34;?<br /><br />That’s the arrogance of George W. Bush who was pushed aside by Obama for eight years in 2008 who in his turn tried to have diplomacy prevail, though he was obsessive and obsessional about cyber security and cyber intelligence and had everyone in the world eavesdropped upon by the CIA. Note I must be old fashioned and from outside the institution because I do say THE CIA, but also THE FBI and a few others.<br /><br />The film will tell you how foolish of Trump if he were to start another front somewhere in the world. But there is no one more foolish than, a populist politician or a circus clown. The difference is that when the populist politician falls on his face it is in the midst of maximum destruction and mass killings, whereas a clown falls on his face to make children laugh. Sooner or later Trump will be the monster in the closet that will come out “if you do not go to sleep immediately.” How many lateral, bilateral and collateral victims will you count in six months? Already several thousands in just a few weeks.<br /><br />Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU<br /><br />OLD REVIEW, MANY YEARS AGO<br /><br />This is an essential film to understand where the world stands and where it is going in the present period. De Niro signs here a severe and ruthless denunciation of the methods of the US government in the world since they started the CIA at the end of the 30s. A young man, the son of a dead-by-suicide officer of some sort, is recruited by the FBI to find out the identities of the members of a fascist group that is in fact in the hand of an American agent unknown of the FBI. He will then become an essential agent in London during the war and in Berlin after the world, covered as a commercial agent, and it is trade and nothing else, to exchange some fascist scientists who are not too important for the Jewish scientists the Soviets are getting rid of.<br /><br />This will lead the main character who is the head of the office in Berlin to recruit a KGB agent into his service. What is very strange is that the CIA does not find out this agent is being recruited under the name of another KGB agent (the CIA was un-informed on the subject which means they did not cover the whole world and had weak points, just like the Soviet should not have used the name of another KGB agent) and it is done with the complicity of an English agent. This man will become the mole in the CIA when Cuba becomes communist and when the US tries to organize the re-conquest in the Bay of Pigs.<br /><br />The failure is so enormous that they decide that there must have been a mole. And they start looking for it. The Soviet then start playing cat and mouse with the main character and manage to compromise his son in the business by making him fall in love with a woman in Africa, or at least have a sudden desire for the woman that turns into love but this woman is one of their agents. That titillates the man and he really digs out what he can dig out and finds out the real mole by some simple action: to check a book that was offered to that mole by some English agent when he was finally recruited by the CIA.<br /><br />That book should have been checked and was not. Negligence and non-professionalism. And this ex-KGB agent is never the object of the slightest doubt even when another KGB agent arrives and pretends he is the man carrying the name the ex-KGB agent has been recruited under. It is the son who will pay, and pay dearly, for the amateurish caper, indirectly for sure since the woman will be eliminated. So much for love among spies. But what is left after this action is finished, a tremendous action with numerous intertwined though clearly identified flashbacks over the whole period from the 1920s to the mid 1960s?<br /><br />First that this CIA was born in super-patriotic and super-nationalist secret groups in the US, groups that ignore democracy and in a way human dignity, since the new members have to go through a fight in the nude, in mud and with the older members eventually pissing on them. These circles and groups are dangerous. What's more they are so closed up onto themselves that they lose somewhere the necessary objectivity and a negligence becomes possible and a double agent can infiltrate the whole system. The second lesson is that this CIA is supposed to reshape the world in conformity with what the US wants.<br /><br />This is also very dangerous, and there the film is totally idealistic: the CIA can do what they want they can only slow down change in the world, not reverse it, Latin America being the best case ever. It has never been so nearly unanimously on the left, dark and deep pink if not completely red, and only as a reaction to the US's use of the CIA to manipulate people. These agents are also extremely inhuman. They have to forget all links with family, friends, relatives, or any acquaintances.<br /><br />They must be ready to betray all these in the name of their mission and purity and kill every time it is necessary. They are kept under constant surveillance either by the other side or by people on the US side that no one knows. The film finally gives you one example of the El Ghraib torturing methods and that really makes you shudder and shiver. And the tragic end will be all the more pathetic when we know the victim was right and telling the truth. A film you must see absolutely.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUchecked and was not.

0385522401|5.0|Ian McEwan is one of the best writers of our time. His new novel is very short -- novella length at something on the order of 38,000 words. It is nominally the story of one night -- the wedding night of a young British couple in 1962. (Critically, as Christopher Hitchens points out, a year before \\"sexual intercourse began\\", in the famous words of Philip Larkin.) Of course the story really extends backward -- to the childhoods of the two, and to their courtship -- and forward, to tell quickly how their lives worked out.    The trouble is, they are both virgins. Edward, the man, is terribly concerned that his inexperience will lead to an embarrassing failure to perform -- or, as it were, rather too rapid a performance. Florence's problems are more severe -- she is terribly afraid of sex, and she really does not want to have sex at all. Ever. It is not that Florence does not love Edward -- she does, quite sincerely. And she is not purely a mouse -- she is a very accomplished violinist, and the forceful leader of a promising string quartet. Edward quite sincerely loves Florence, and is consumed with desire for her. He took a first in History and hopes to write short popular historical books.     Their real problem, however (beyond Florence's evident psychological hangup, whatever its origin), is that they are culturally unable to talk about sex, or about their desires, fears, experiences or lack thereof -- anything at all. Mind you this is still a problem for people, but not to anything like the degree it was in 1962 (perhaps, though I am not sure, especially in England.) Class is also an issue -- Edward is of a slightly (though not terribly) lower class than Florence, and in particular his family has much less money. And so the novel turns on an eventually disastrous experience, and the small-t tragic results not just of that experience but of their dual failure to work through it by even the simplest of words.     It is very fine stuff, if quite small scale -- minor,surely, but well worth having.

B000N6U0E2|3.0|Everyone's used to seeing Will Smith in the action/funny man role and it does get old after a while. But thankfully, as he's getting older, he's turning to different roles in the last few years, there's been Ali (which I haven't seen, but read some good reviews) and this. (We'll exclude Hitch completely.)<br /><br />Pursuit of Happyness is based on a true story, about a period in a man's life, where absolutely everything that could possibly go wrong, does go wrong. I've kinda been on a downer the past couple of days and this is the perfect movie to help you along if you're in that kinda mood, and I topped my mood off even worse by watching the last couple of discs of the final ever seaon of Quantum Leap. Thoroughly depressed? You bet.<br /><br />Will plays Chris Gardner absolutely brilliantly, and it's a role he's never really done before. I was so involved in the movie that I forgot to even look out for Dan Castellaneta (Homer in the Simpsons) - clue: he asks Chris for a donut! It's a truly heart wrenching story, and I was nearly in tears at some points, from having to bunk down for the night in a men's toilets, to having all the money taken from his account in one swoop. His wife walks out on him, leaving with a five year old son (who's Will's real life son), he's selling something that is probably unsellable, he gets arrested for unpaid traffic tickets, and just when he thinks nothing else can happen, it does.<br /><br />The way this film depicts poverty in America looks extremely accurate and gut wrenchingly honest. It hurts to watch it, but then the movie is enriched by the fact the two actors playing father & son are actually father & son, and it's a great chemistry and bond between them, but must have been hard for Jaden at some points, particularly when he has to be yelled at. He's quite the little scene stealer isn't he? But then so was the old guy who thought the x-ray machine thing was a time machine. He was hilarious, I wanted to see more of him.<br /><br />It's a truly magical movie, and I won't give too much more away than I already have. But if you've seen enough of Will doing the action man movie, this is one to pick up. It's definitely worth it.and I won't give too much more away than I already have.

B00026WU9Q|5.0|This is my favorite of Dylan's early work.  While anything I might say about the songs themselves would be redundant at this point (as they are all brilliant), I would like to point out that this album has some of Dylan's best liner notes.  Lines like....<br /><br />\\"I would rather model harmonica holders than discuss Aztec anthropology\\"..<br /><br />\\"I accept chaos.  I'm not sure whether it accepts me\\"<br /><br />\\"If someone thinks that Norman Mailer is more important than Hank Williams, that's fine\\".<br /><br />....are really thought provoking.  Here's some thoughts they provoke...<br /><br />One Hank Williams song (or Merle Haggard or Patsy Cline for that matter) has more truth in it than Mailer.  I hope chaos accepts me, too, because it grants me life.  Why Bela Tarr has such trouble getting funding when Michael Bay continues to make 200 million dollar movies is beyond any rational comprehension....<br /><br />I want a soul mate like the woman in She Belongs to Me....
B000E33VWW|5.0|Capote is a film no writer really deserves. What of Faulkner, Melville or Hemingway? Why Capote? Something clearly intrigues the artistic mind about this little man, who as shown in this film was a little, awful man. He is depicted here as a manipulator and user. He got in with the killers out in Kansas and then pretended to care in order to get their story, in much the same way he had squeezed reticent Marlon Brando for a story about his alcoholic mother. This is a very well made little picture, supremely well-acted by Hoffman, who has been growing year by year into a formidable actor. Just think of that awful little fat boy in \\"Boogie Nights\\" and consider how far he has come, giving here one of the great performances of the decade. He is a brave, daring actor, fearless really, and willing to go where few of our handsome leading men are willing to venture. His imitation of Capote is at times spot-on, eerily accurate and yet dynamically singular. The film too has merit. It is a tragedy about a tragedy. It took a while, but clearly Capote decided to kill himself after the hangings in Kansas. One is haunted by the image of Capote pacing the floor of his apartment at the UN Plaza, drinking away his sorrow.
0792163710|5.0|Does not get much better than this; I can watch this movie over and over.  Action, good versus bad, young kid and a side line love story.  I can just imagine what the story lines would be for this movie if it were made today.  The location for the movie is unbelievable, I wish I could have seen it on the big screen.  The movie is shot in the Tetons, in Wyoming I believe.  I could watch this movie over and over.  If you like westerns and have never seen it, do you self a favor and watch it.  A good old fashion western, great ending.
B0002IU988|4.0|I love Mark Tremonti's style of playing. Always liked the heavier Creed tracks like 'Ode' and 'Bullets' so i knew Alter Bridge would be a treat. Especially for the more Metal/Guitar based sound i like hearing. But i expected that the songwriting quality would be just a notch below Creed par. I was wrong.<br />The songs really breathe and shine. I must say that the upbeat lyrics like that of the title track are a pleasant change from what i usually listen to but the Guitar playing is masterful. The Creed formula is intact on tracks like 'Open Your Eyes', 'Down to my Last', 'Burn it down', and 'Broken Wings' which are all pleasant tracks. Showing who probably created most of Creeds defining songs because they could be on a Creed CD as is. Vocally, it is well executed. The singer is a decent enough replacement for Scott Stapp. A higher pitch that suits the tracks well.<br /><br />..'In loving Memory' is a very personal track that is just great both Guitar wise and Vocally. A gem.<br /><br />Best songs though, IMO, are the ones that let Tremonti really shine. 'Find The Real', 'One Day Remains', 'Metalingus'(which is a superior track), 'Watch Your Words' and 'The End is Here' are all great guitar based Rock/Metal. They suit the metalhead in me just fine, making this a very well balanced CD and a must for all the leftover Creed fans out there. People can be narrow minded in the Metal community, this band should not be overlooked because its lyrically uplifting sometimes. Must say im looking forward to the next release. Its been a long time coming now.<br /><br />I actually cant believe the audacity of 21 people who gave this CD 1 star.

Cash is in many ways an obscure or remote figure, hard to embrace and difficult to be \\"crazy about\\" in quite the same way as one falls for the King, but what a gift. This film is a deserved tribute surely. The casting is marvelous; one can't really imagine a better group of actors being assembled. Phoenix and Witherspoon are a delightful couple. She sparkles like a star, even when he, like a stone, drops into one of his moods. The forbidding Robert Patrick plays the father as a dark force, harsh and judgmental like a Baptist minister. I loved it when June's parents waved their shotguns at the drug dealer trying to bring a stash to Johnny. Those were simple folk and simpler times. Again and again, we see pictures of the 50s and 60s in film and wonder what happened to this great country.

0553296981|5.0|From mid-1942 to August 1944, accompanied with other Jews, the Jewish Frank family went into hiding in an attic in hope that they would survive the Nazi's persecution of the Jews. At the beginning of this period, Anne Frank, thirteen years old, started a diary, which was a record of her two years hiding in the attic.<br /><br />At first, most of her diary was childish. A good portion of her diary was about the squabbles between her family and one of the other families, the Van Daans. She also included her arguments with her mother, her conflicts with her roommate, Albert Dussel, her dislike towards Peter Van Daan, and the inconveniences of living in the attic. Anne had a hot temper and was disliked by everyone else, often ending in tears after arguments with various people. She often fumed at her mother and her sister, Margot. She was immature and stubborn at the time, and was extremely sensitive.<br /><br />Later in the book, Anne developed more sophisticated thinking and mature views. She found ways to cool off after a debate and got more control. She wasn't as emotionally fragile as she was before. Anne started focusing more of her time on philosophical matters rather than small, unimportant arguments. She started to have a liking towards Peter Van Daan, whom, a year before, she thought was an obnoxious little brat. She wasn't so prejudiced towards Ms. Van Daan and she stopped getting mad at Margot. As Anne progressed, she gained valuable wisdom through the toughness of her situation and wrote with an adult-level quality.<br /><br />I think this is a great book for almost anyone, and I certainly recommend that you read it.

B000002A3T|4.0|Pink Floyd would come to full form with the 1994 release The Division Bell after reinstating Richard Wright as a full-time salaried band member.  No longer having to contend with Roger Waters, they now could focus on what they do best which is write and record great music.  \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\" supposedly was about the fall of the Berlin Wall five years earlier but might also be interpreted as the fall of the \\"wall\\" that was Roger Waters.  \\"Keep Talking\\" is communication among partners struggling to maintain a relationship.  The line from \\"Lost For Words\\" that says \\"so I open the door to my enemies and I ask could we wipe the slate clean but they tell me to please go f--- myself\\" most likely refers back to the days when Gilmour, Mason, and Wright fought tooth and nail with Waters over the right to the band name.  This is the 1994 version of Wish You Were Here.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|The third movie in the series of the CIA amnesiac super agent, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is as dynamic, fast-moving, filled with the first class chase sequences, and never-stopping tension as the first two movies. All three movies make a very exiting trilogy and also manage to tell something mportant on the subject of the honorable goals that not always justify the means. This time, Jason Bourne is set to find out how, when, and where it all started for him. He wants to remember all, he wants to know what the flashbacks that keep coming back mean and by doing so, he once again becomes a danger to CIA. The agency made him a part of a special top-secret program \\"Blackbriar\\" which had created a perfect killing machine, a super assassin out of him. Now, he presents an imminent danger for CIA's director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn) who had approved the program and for Noah Vosen (David Strathairn, excellent as usual), the chief of department's division of top secret operations. Vosen does not hate Bourne personally. He knows that Bourne is as a treat for the agency and has to be eliminated and he would use all possible high-tech devices and techniques as well as ruthless manipulation to trace him and to see him dead. Bourne also has allies inside CIA, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (grown up Julia Stiles has just a few words in the script but the close ups of her face that changed emotions and feelings so vividly made her character compelling and memorable.)<br /><br />A lot has been said about Paul Greengrass's (\\"United 93,\\" \\"Bourne Supremacy\\") directing and his use of fast cuts and an unsteady camera. I found his approach competent, appropriate and fully justified. In the film packed with suspense and thrills, at least two chase scenes are perfect and breathtaking. The long scene in London Waterloo station where Bourne tries to make a contact with a reporter for The Guardian, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is a masterwork. Bourne knows that Ross has been watched by the CIA high-tech specialists in NYC office and has been followed by the operatives at the station while an excellent sniper is waiting somewhere for a signal to terminate the reporter. Bourne controls the situation by trying to get the information from Ross and to protect him. Another scene takes place in Tangier as Bourne attempts to talk to a man from his flashbacks who has knowledge of his past before he ever became Jason Bourne. Bringing the action to Tangier, reminds me the old movie \\"Pepe Le Moko\\" (1937) directed by Julien Duvivier where the main character stuck forever in the suffocating maze of narrow streets of Tangier. It also made me think that Bourne movies are not just high adrenalin thrillers/mystery/spy flicks but they are first of all about longing for home, the quest for returning to the roots, searching for and understanding one's real identity and as such they are more interesting, deeper, and poignant than just a well done action flick. Maybe the movies would not have made me think so had another actor played Jason Bourne. Matt Damon, the actor with a lot of charisma and high intelligence is perfect for a role of a thinking superman that wants to know who and what is behind his super abilities.<br /><br />4.5/5 or 9/10e CIA high-tech specialists in NYC office and has been followed by the operatives at the station while an excellent sniper is waiting somewhere for a signal to terminate the reporter.

B00005JPQR|5.0|\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" is a non-stop action thriller that continues the saga of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), a CIA-trained assassin in search of the people who brainwashed him and trained him to kill for them. Picking up right where \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" left off, the film opens with Bourne evading the Moscow police. He then heads to London, where he reads a newspaper article in which journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) describes Jason Bourne and a CIA operation known as Blackbriar. Bourne arranges to meet Ross at Waterloo Station to get information on his source, but corrupt CIA official Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) interferes with the meeting. Still, Bourne is able to get information on the Blackbriar source and sets out to get to the bottom of things.<br /><br />This movie is incredible. Every scene is one seamless action sequence after another. Bourne travels to multiple cities across the globe, and the director uses crazy hand-held camera work to enhance the action scenes. I really like the fact that the Bourne films aren't littered with unnecessary special effects. All the surveillance, chase and fight scenes are done exceptionally well so they don't look fake. The theatre I went to was packed, and it was fun to see so many people on the edge of their seats throughout the entire film, gasping and cheering at the appropriate places. Bourne is a modern-day James Bond, and I sincerely hope that Damon will make a few more of these incredible movies.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|The word that I frist heard describing Kelly's new Album was edgey, and if by edgey you mean full of annoying guitar melody's then it is very edgey. The lyrics are fine, but they would have worked so much better if they were put the good music. Like I said the lead guitar is just overwhelming and annoying. Kelly Clarkson is famous because she is an amazing singer, and I don't want to hear her overshadowed with guitar melodies and overproduced background beats.
B000002U8G|5.0|This 1971 release was a foreshadowing of good things to come for Pink Floyd.  They were always known for composing and recording long tracks that painted a grand musical portrait.  One Of These Days is one of their best known compositions favored by audiences worldwide.  Nick Mason in the middle of the track says 'one of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces' in case you didn't know.  But the track that really stands out is Echoes which takes up all of Side 2 on the cassette version.  If I had to choose which Pink Floyd song was the best ever recorded it would be Echoes.  The song best exemplifies the outstanding musicianship that Pink Floyd is known for.  Probably the weakest track on the album is Seamus which features a bluesy David Gilmour playing to the background of a howling dog.  Fearless has a sound sample of a crowd chanting and clapping at a soccer match.  Meddle has all the ingredients of the music and sound  samples that would come to define their best-seller Dark Side Of The Moon.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural has become my all-time favorite t.v. series! Gorgeous leading hunks and outstanding story lines that keep you on the edge of your seat! What's not to like?! I'd give it more stars if I could. I am counting down the days when Season 2 is available on DVD and of course, the season 3 premiere of Supernatural. This series is so addictive, it's like a good book you can't put down. Despite that 1 negative review, I absolutely love it!! Everyone in America and around the World is hooked on this show!

I love it -- and I have 12 other sock books.

0151013047|5.0|Rarely will I describe a book as beautiful.  Yet I cannot think of a more befitting descriptive for Mohsin Hamid's THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST.<br /><br />The story centers around a meeting at an outdoor caf&eacute; in Lahore between a Pakistani man named Changez and a suspicious-looking American with the bearing that makes him out to be either military or intelligence agent.  Changez engages the man initially in tea and conversation.  After awhile, seeing the American most attentive --and also a bit wary of his surroundings, the Pakistani orders dinner for the two of them; meanwhile going deeper into his memories about times spent in America, as a student at Princeton and later as a rising star at a New York valuation firm.  Changez also recollects his budding romance with Erica, the daughter of a wealthy investment banker who was sure to enable Changez's entry to high society.  Changez was well on his way to success when the  twin towers of the World Trade Center came tumbling down on September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Changez's reaction to their collapse alarms and confuses him; he finds himself smiling and overjoyed.  The elation, however, isn't over the deaths of 3,000 innocent people, but rather thet there are those who are able to strike at the United States --an entity which has long held him in awe with its almost limitless power, wealth and ability to affect the world: sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst.  As America becomes enraged and seeks revenge upon anything and anyone Muslim, he reads reports of Pakistan becoming coerced into the war against Afghanistan and of India taking advantage of this situation threatening his  homeland.  Becoming ever more distanced from our society and his work, it becomes increasingly harder for Changez to continue at his career.  A job which he now sees as dependent upon the expense and suffering of others. Making matters worse, Erica, the one person who perhaps could have kept him grounded and focused, suffers a mental relapse over the shock of 9/11.  Erica slips back into the debilitating state she suffered over the death of her longtime childhood friend and lover, Chris, two years earlier.  Eventually Changez returns to Pakistan.  Changez today is a different man from the ambitious and obedient corporate cog he described living back in New York.  Yet as he speaks to the American about his country's indifference to the rest of the world, about America's unconcern for the expense her wars of revenge are costing others, he still he cannot hide his love for America.  However, it is no longer the romanticizing love of an infatuated innocent, instead it is the love one has for another depite all the other's faults and abuses.  A love reluctant, but love nonetheless.<br /><br />The monologue telling of this story is beguiling.  Changez holds the reader spellbound as he keeps the unidentified American man's interest for hours.  Mohsin Hamid's gift for words and symbolism, and the intricacies he creates with them, is astounding.  Admittedly, some of Changez actions and statements will repel many of us American readers (his gleeful response to the jets slamming into the Twin Towers certainly did it to me).  Keep in mind, however, that this is a voice which exists amongst millions of those out there, from Totonto and London, to Pakistan and Indonesia.  It is a voice we have been told to ignore, but it still won't go away.  That's because it is not only the voice of the popeyed rageboys constantly being shown in our media, but also the voice of men like Changez, who tried making sense of America's dichotomies, but can no longer struggle to reconcile the willful ignorance and arrogant indifference that exists within our nation's beauty and spirit.  So, we may call them \\"fundamentalists,\\" but we must start to recognize that many are reluctant to be such.  They have the rageboys, but we have the coldly calculating geopolitical experts, who smile and assure us of our \\"national interests.\\"  Changes must come from all of us.ll of us.

B000QUUD60|2.0|The 'Special Edition' is fantastic. But, it is the same as the 2001 edition......    The 'Theatrical Version' sounded better on VHS & TV etc... THEY BLEW IT!!!!  The sound is low...no Bass....awful!!    I bought this to get the 'Theatrical Version' with GREAT sound. There are moments on that version not on the 'Special Edition; like when Elvis tries to find a working microphone....the \\"2 out of 4 aint bad\\" part.    I cant believe in 2007 they can do no better than this. It almost a 2nd generation ripoff of the VHS.    PS- This is not Elvis' fault....he gives great performances....ruined by the thumblefisted production crew.    They filmed 6 shows in 3 different outfits. Give ME the MASTER tapes and I would produce a 4 hour extravaganza for all Elvis fans.    Horrible job.
B000065BPB|5.0|Great product. It is great to be able to replace several parts on these headphones.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I traditionally listen to the more older hard rock and metal bands, but I believe that's what I like about Avenged Sevenfold, and this album, their third has everything I'm looking for. They are so obviously influenced by Pantera, Guns and Roses, Iron Maiden, Alice n' Chains, and Black Sabbath. They use classic metal riffs in a new and refreshing way, and Synister Gates, their lead guitarist, for as young as he is, will one day become a guitar god, he's allready that good. It's not about the image, it's not about the fact that they're played on TRL or Fuse, because they are above that image. Look at the lyrics and see for yourself. Besides, nothing goes better with heavy metal licks then beatiful classic guitar and an orchestra. It's just beautiful.
B00004RJ71|1.0|This movie was lame! Bag acting, bad dialogue, bad directing, just bad! Who said chicanos like benjiman bratt should look like jewish homies, and Meklo are a typical chicano name, Ha Ha! the only positive thing I can say about this flick is it does end.  Blood in( my cash) Blood out( should have killed myself for watching it)
B0001WTVUW|4.0|Yes, some cheesy acting here and there, some melodrama and so forth. But it was an 80s telemovie, so what more could one expect?  Okay, to be fair, the portrayal of nuclear devastation and the resulting radiation poisoning is quite good.  And to know that almost everyone is doomed is a sobering thought to ponder at the end, after viewing the final scene of two strangers trying to comfort each other in the aftermath of the holocaust.
0385522401|1.0|This book was a neurotic waste of time! You don't need a novel to tell you how important it is to communicate with others.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|Very enjoyable movie.  More than I expected.  I watched 300 just before this, it blows it away both in terms of enjoyment and visual quality.  I think it looks better than Crank and Casino Royale.  If you're looking for a movie to check out your Blu-ray machine, this is the one (I am using PS3 with 1080i component). I was constantly screwing with my television to see if something was wrong with my picture settings when watching 300.  Not so with Shooter, it looked 10x better. Also, as a sidenote, what is up with Danny Glover's lisp?  Too much hallucinogenics?
B000OVLBEO|3.0|Maybe one of the downfalls I had with this movie is that I hadn't read any of the comics about the Ghostrider, and it didn't provide any significant amount of information for those of us who didn't know. However, I saw the previews and what caught my attention was two things. First, it had Nicholas Cage in it, and I think that he is an awesome actor; no matter what role he is playing. Second, the effects. The way he and his bike turned and changed was awesome.   I do, however, feel that this movie had so much more potential than was put to use! It could have been so much better, in my personal opinion. And the ending didn't thrill me all that much, either. I was very disappointed in the way it was chosen to end.   But, overall, I thought it was a pretty good movie and I would watch it again because I am a die-hard Nicholas Cage fan.
B000P0J024|5.0|Great value; 2 CDs and a DVD; the DVD is a very interesting account of how the Wilburys got together with some great footage. It is also rather emotional to see George and Roy Orbison looking and sounding so well.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Recently received the new CD by Bon Jovi. \\"Lost Highway\\" is a great compilation of songs, wasn't sure what to expect because some were saying it was country CD. I do enjoy some country music but I'm a big rock fan for the most part. Although you can certainly hear country influences, the CD rocks like only the boys from Jersey can and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire project. I love that they keep challenging themselves, they get better with age, they're keeping it fresh and that they still enjoy what they're doing while keeping their fans happy. I would suggest not to hesitate a moment and run out and get \\"Lost Highway,\\" you'll be very pleased. Can't wait to see Bon Jovi on tour in November!
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Love this movie still watch it to this day its so magical, funny, and refreshing to watch.
B00005JPLW|1.0|Wow! without a doubt the worst film that I have seen since Sin City. Fancy computer graphics and a nice soundtrack do not a movie make.
B000PY52EU|5.0|This is another Samuel L. Jackson movie with SNAKE in the title.  However this movie is more story driven than most movies you will see today.  The acting performances are solid & Jackson turns in another great effort.  Christina Ricci as the female lead does a superb job.  The supporting performances are quite good including one by boy bander Justin Timberlake as Ricci's boyfriend.
B00005JPAO|5.0|This film is elegant, clever, interesting, profound, and, above all, incredibly funny! It is not a comedy really, but a very witty take on a crisis.   The film concentrates on the role of the queen during a tragic event. Some of the people surrounding her, like Prince Charles and Tony Blair catch on immediately that this crisis calls for action from the royals. However, the film makes it clear that the queen's reaction is colourde by her past: she experienced the crisis during her uncle's abdication - which lead to her own father's early death - and the horrors of the second world first hand. She could not understand the effect of the death of one royal on a public cushioned by a long time of relative peace and prosperity. However, she shows her strength by stepping down and acknowledging the grief of her people.  Prince Philip is mercilessly parodied as living in his own private reality which only momentarily toches our own reality! However, the film also delivers some kicks to both Cherie Blair and Alasdair Campbell as they are portrayed as extremely arrogant and self-righteous, and in a way are as separated from the common man as Prince Philip.   The also hints at one more reason why the queen hesitated to assume leadership of the grieving masses: she also experienced the 1930s, and had a terrible fear of what could happen in times of mass-hysteria. She did not wan any part of that! She sees the role of the monarch as being a pillar of stability in a chaotic world.  The film offers no clear judgement of the actions of the queen, but it gives an explanation for her actions, and a possible understanding.   The film can also be seen as a comment on Tony Blair, as he himself got caugh in a swirl of hysteria and involved himself in the very questionable invasion of Iraq.
0061122416|4.0|An alchemist is one who can take an element and turn it into gold.  The beauty of this book is as much in sharing it as it is in reading it.  Finding and following dreams is a lifelong task as you will realize after reading it, but dream quests are paramount for the teenager.  I urge you to give your copy of this book to a teenager in your life.  Give a gift, no greater than the written word to someone who will prosper from it more than you.
1400032717|5.0|This novel provides and interesting insight into the thoughts and actions of a person living with autism or Asperger's Disorder.  When viewed through the main character's perspective, actions that would seem very unusual or disturbing to outside observers are more understandable.  Haddon worked with autistic children in the past, and it is my sincere hope that he consulted with experts and made certain that this novel portrays the autistic mind as accurately as possible.  The plot of the novel is keeps your attention does and excellent job of creating emotional situations that juxtapose the main character's logical demeanor.  However, the plot is not the main reason this is a great book.  If you're looking for a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery, look elsewhere.  If you're interested in autism and want to understand it better, this is a must read.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|I was very pleased with this one.  I love action movies that grab you quickly at the beginning and don't let go.  This is one of those movies.  OK, these movies don't win 'movie of the year', but neither do comedies (my other fav genre).  This is recommended for those who like these action movies as well!

1401211909|5.0|On the back cover of the first copy I bought, someone was quoted saying something along the lines of \\"This is the kind of story you curl up with hot chocolate to read\\" - and it is. It feels a bit wrong to call this a fantasy, that genre having gained some uncomfortable connotations lately. Strictly speaking, though, fantasy is older than Tolkien and Lewis. This is a fantasy, or fairytale, in the manner of Oscar Wilde, written by a man who is famous for his nack for finding magic in the krinkly corners of our sometimes constricting reality, and turning it into fascinating stories, fantasy or not. And in this case, mr. Gaiman's prose and Charles Vess' illustrations go together perfectly, portraying the strange and terrible beauty of Faerie. \\"Being A Romance Within The Realms Of Faerie\\" is really the best description of the story, and all you really need. Read it at night, during winter, by a fireplace, and don't forget the cocoa.

B0000009SI|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various music supplies and recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />\\"Apostrophe\\" released in March of 1974 has been called \\"More accessible Zappa.\\"  Maybe because of its gold record status but don't think for one moment the nine tracks don't have Frank's analytical and off-beat sense of humor as well as the stellar playing that has been a Zappa calling card from day one.<br /><br />\\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\\" starts the journey with terrific instrumentation and Frank's in your face lyrics- \\"Watch out where the huskies go.\\"  \\"Nanook Rubs It\\" continues the theme of snow and Zappa describes the situation as follows: \\"He went right up side the head of my favorite babysitter.\\"  \\"St. Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast\\" fits in well with the two prior tracks.  The songs are effortlessly blended together and the fusion of rock, jazz, improvisation, and the kitchen sink gives the listener a plethora of information to absorb.  The beauty of a Zappa composition is the need to listen to it several times to fully digest the wealth of superlatives.  \\"Cosmik Debris\\" with the haunting vocals enhanced by great background singing is a tune that even those that are so-so to Zappa's creativity have found to be classic.  \\"Apostrophe\\" with bass-playing by Jack Bruce (Cream) is simply at a different level.  The combination of Zappa/Bruce have no musical ceiling.  They are virtuosos and show it throughout the tune, not with a need to overplay but with tasty interplay, that leaves the listener breathless.<br /><br />The assemblage of seasoned pros on the record is tremendous.  George Duke on keyboards, Aynsley Dunbar drums, and Tom Fowler bass as well as the rest of the crew make this everything you would want in a Zappa release.<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"

I read this book in two days, waiting for a fuller development and conclusion. I like the Then/Now format Ms. Picoult used. Overall, though, this story never came up to my expectations.<br /><br />I know a great deal about Chris, but Emily's character wasn't developed fully enough. I want to know exactly what her motivations were. I kept expecting to see other secrets revealed about her family. They weren't there.<br /><br />The ending disappointed me. It felt unrealistic and contrived.

Not only does my book include interviews with several THE SECRET participants, it gives you the details on how Byrne's book and DVD came into being in the first place, which is an interesting case study in viral marketing. It also explains what (and why) is flawed about Byrne's claims, including that \\"science\\" and quantum physics proves the LOA to be true. THE SECRET OF THE SECRET goes into detail about what's actually viable about positive thinking theory. I am not entirely debunking The Secret, however.  It actually is a really good companion to THE SECRET, no matter what side you fall on in believing in the LOA or whether you have been pleased or disappointed with the results of trying the LOA.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|It's mostly a good movie, I notice, when a movie is based in some kind of reality, a true story, or a story with some truth to it.  It gives the viewer more reason to get lost in the movie.  And, this movie was totally based on reality.  Will Smith does an excellent job of acting.  My opinion is that this movie, The Pursuit of Happyness, is his best acting in film.  It was so well done, and well acted by everyone, including the little child, and also Thandie Newton is an excellent actress portraying a bitter, disappointed, working-class struggling wife.  Most working class Americans can relate to this story, and it gives us hope that maybe one day our struggles will cease too.
B000LC4TJ0|4.0|I second a previous reviewer's concern about the lack of interest in this art-form by our young people. We need to get them into the operahouses and musical theaters and this production is just another way to accomplish that; most of them wont listen to any musical theater and equate Broadway musicals with opera.
B00005JPLW|4.0|This is a great movie. It does not pretend to be History. It is more about the character of oral historical tradition than it is about the written word. The extras are very good. They shed light on the process of interpretation that is often, if not always, subjective story-telling. In one extra F. Miller says that what he is doing is an evocation of History and not a strict retelling. He will never be accused of Realism, he says.<br />Ancient myths are said to be real historical events that have become distorted with each retelling. Herodotus himself did not see first-hand what he wrote about. 300 is as much about the telling of the tale as it is about the tale told. It is the Battle of Thermopylae as told by the Spartans themselves.There are some lines of dialogue that come off as veiled pro-war propaganda and other lines that portray the hubris and hypocrisy that so often colors oral histories, but overall it is true to Frank Miller's comicbook series. Some scenes are direct translations of his bold graphic style. It is a state of the art update on an old Hollywood standard- the sword and sandal epic. Except that all sets are CGI, and that is where the movie excels. It is like watching classical sculpture come alive.<br />It is gothic for two reasons. The predominant use of the color black, and in the methods used by the Spartans to battle their enemy. At the beginning of the movie there is some use of the battle phalanx that historically defined the Spartan method of War. This correct reference is soon abandoned in favor of a Berserker type method of combat. The style of fighting progresses from the classical to the  kind of fighting practiced by Germanic tribes of Gothic warriors, the ones who overran and later assimilated into the Roman Empire.<br />None of this spoiled the movie for me. It is quite curious, though, that this movie gets the greenlight at a time when the US is at war with Iraq. Historically, the US can be seen as inheritors of the Greek systems of government and Iraq is geographically located at the central point of what was the Persian Empire. Also curious is the tendency for those in the movie-making industry to use actors with Scottish accents battling actors with British accents whenever they portray the struggle between \\"establishment\\" and \\"revolutionary\\" elements.

B00014TJ7K|5.0|I was a bit thrown for a loop the first time I heard this album, since at the time I had only heard two of George's other solo albums (ATMP and 'Dark Horse'), and was therefore wondering what had happened to the types of spiritual songs I expected from him.  It wasn't that I was expecting all of his albums to be pretty much the same, but just hadn't been expecting something in such a different vein.  But after getting over that initial surprise, I came to see just what a fine perfectly-polished flawless album this is.  There isn't a single bad song or throwaway on here; indeed, every single song is so good that they all could have been singles.  Quite possibly it's his most commercial album, what with all of the pop and rock songs instead of more mellow serious fare, and no wonder that it got almost near-universal rave reviews at its release and is still considered one of his finest now twenty years later.  And though a lot of the songs do have that signature Eighties sound, it doesn't sound dated at all today.  There's enough of the sound of the era to distinguish it in a normal way without screaming \\"Made in 1987!\\" either.  And as a child of the Eighties, I'm not complaining.<br /><br />All of the songs are pulsing with energy, professionalism, perfection, polish, sparkling wit.  Along with songs bursting with tongue-in-cheek humor and gentle self-deprication such as \\"When We Was Fab\\" and \\"Wreck of the Hesperus\\" are rockers like the title track and \\"Fish on the Sand,\\" softer songs like \\"Someplace Else\\" and \\"Breath Away from Heaven\\" (the latter of which really brings to life the feeling of really being back in ancient China), and social commentary songs like \\"Devil's Radio.\\"  The album came out shortly before I turned eight years old, and I well remember that \\"Got My Mind Set on You\\" became annoyingly overplayed on both the radio and MTV.  But that shouldn't be a reason to avoid revisiting this album or getting acquainted with it for the first time.  Some things with so much hype really do live up to the hype and do age well, after all of the critical hub-bub and endless radio play have died down.  Just because an album was hugely popular doesn't mean it's not really worthwhile.ch hype really do live up to the hype and do age well, after all of the critical hub-bub and endless radio play have died down.

0743496728|5.0|Nineteen Minutes is an engaging novel about a high school massacre, similar to Columbine. The characters are believable, and the author expertly jumps back and forth from past to present, and from one character to another, building the momentum. It's a great human drama as well as a legal thriller. I strongly recommend this to adults and teenagers. It's an important book for teachers to read as well. While I realize that this is fiction, and there were some contrivances used to build the drama, I still think that this is an important book as well as a riveting page-turner.

B000FP2OPY|4.0|I was skeptical of this series because I thought it was a rip-off of \\"The X-Files\\" aimed at kids. Okay, so it is like \\"The X-Files\\" but instead of the sexy agents Mulder and Scully it's sexy Winchester brothers Sam and Dean, but this series is a heck of a lot of fun with lots of crazy twists and turns and some fascinating plot elements. Sometimes the brothers can act immature and pouty, but they're having a good time hunting the bad guys, meeting hot girls (which is unrealistic in my book, but hey, I'm watching this series, right?), and learning more about their mysterious father, who is nowhere to be found but still manages to leave them clues as to \\"cases\\" he wants them to solve.<br /><br />There are thrills and chills: some are downright creepy, others are cheap but serve for a jump, and still some will have scaredy cats who are afraid of the dark reaching for a flashlight. But with these brothers around, being afraid of the dark might not be such a bad thing.

B00006F7S4|5.0|This is probably my favorite Beck cd.    I thought it was so weird that Beck had recorded an album that was basically just depressed, much of the time, his music IS very dark, but there is always sory of happy over-tones to it all, not at all with this, it's quite blunt that he was dealing with alot, but it's also a very easy album to connect with emotionally.
0553278223|3.0|I thought it was funny that, when commenting on the TV Miniseries adaptation of this book, Bradbury said it was \\"just boring\\" because that is what I thought of the book.    This is not one consistent and connected story, but rather a collection of short stories about the future history of a Mars colonization.  Anyone who has read \\"The Illustrated Man\\" knows that short stories are not Bradbury's strength.  Reading this book was like reading a collection of long-lost post-it notes with ideas that popped into Ray's head late at night before he fell asleep.     It's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it to a casual sci-fi or Bradbury fan.
B00005JPLW|3.0|300 has the trappings of Greek history as understood by adolescent minds, but let's hope someone makes a better movie closer to the more interesting facts left out of this script. I am not crazy about how it skirts the idea of social engineering through infanticide, slavery, forced homosexuality among the men and the interesting life women had to lead.  I have no interest in reading the graphic novel probably because of these oversights, especially since so many good histories and drama have been written about this over the centuries.<br /><br />  I like seeing where movies and the actors in them go.  More accurately this is an illustrated fable that is carefully staged and aims at our gut senses.  At a time when freedom feels threatened and so few are keeping their reason and trying to come forward to nurture it, it speaks for our time (going to war with too few troops - sound familiar?) rather than reflecting what really happened. I find the depiction of the eastern and southern people of the other hemisphere as being so exotic and deformed too cartoonish, worthy of very old cartoon racism from newspapers long gone.<br /><br />  The cast is really good.  Most of the actors, save those made up to look otherwise, who play the Greeks, are really attractive. (I am going to be dreaming of Gerard Butler and some of the other Spartans for a while. Lena Headley has been acting since she was a girl.  She has always taken on interesting projects.)  The choreography and blocking are dramatic. Watch this for entertainment.<br /><br />  For a good history closer to the truth, check out the BBC documentary, \\"The Spartans\\", narrated and written by Bettany Hughes.  She explains Thermopylae by walking us through the sites of history and presenting a much more complicated story of Sparta and the recognized world then. She doesn't need special photography or squibs to illustrate the violence and harsh life.  She does use cheese though.  (You have to watch to find out.)<br /><br />  As a very contrived story very loosely following the truth, I liked this movie because it is a little interesting.  The director's commentary is adequate and not really enlightening.a very contrived story very loosely following the truth, I liked this movie because it is a little interesting.

0375703764|5.0|Have you ever held a vial of mercury? Do you remember your surprise that first time? Your surprise to find the weight your eyes had told your hands to expect was a lie? This is the experience that often comes to mind when finding myself again holding this book... each time I find myself tempted to once again wander the halls within the House of Leaves.<br /><br />This book is heavy, much more physically weighty than eyes say it should be. Whether this was intentionally crafted by the creators, or if this is only a residual psychosomatic phenomenon as a result of having read the book, I couldn't say. Both are plausible. Because of how much work was put into distorting this book, I suspect the former cause.<br /><br />If so, this is only the first of a great many intended distortions. \\"House of Leaves\\" is a work of art that appears to be a book, and draws heavily from the genre of literature. It then adds from much more experimental fields to create a specific effect, while simultaneously telling multiple stories. The end result (at first glance) could be mistaken as \\"just some book.\\" This sensory illusion quickly falls apart shortly into the reading.<br /><br />Mercury. The reason such a small quantity is so heavy, of course, is due to density. There is simply more matter contained in the occupied space than past experiences have prepared your mind to expect. This darkness, density and weight is the intended effect behind \\"House of Leaves.\\" The family at the core of this story, trained by experience to expect time and space to operate in only one way, first meet with this darkness upon the discovery that their house is larger on the inside than outside of it.<br /><br />To briefly cover the introduction, the days following this discovery were barely captured, and only on some home video footage and notes. Zampano, who pieced this all together with tape, ink and every available writing surface, called this \\"The Navidson Record.\\" Johnny Truant, who took the dead Zampano's notes from the apartment of the deceased, claims that this record is a lie. Both, however, realize that the truth or falsity of this record does not affect the story's telling.<br /><br />What follows is The Navidson Record, detailing these last days, with footnotes from Zampano, Johnny Truant and The Editors. As previously stated, it is not long until... well... things fall apart. The family, the minds of those who passed on the notes, and the book itself.<br /><br />If you've not yet read \\"House of Leaves,\\" something inside me wants to tell you \\"this book is for you\\" and \\"put aside everything else 'til you've read it.\\" The more honest part of me--the part that's been stirred to raw emotions at only the thought of this book, and can open to nearly any page to feel my eyes tear up--wants to let you know that, should you finish it, this book will not leave you as the same person you were before entering the House of Leaves; that, here, there is no forgiveness, no salvation, nor yellow-brick road; that, within these pages is a creature of shadow, and that this darkness adapts to you--the reader--the more you read.<br /><br />To those readers strong in spirit, who seek that rare strength found only in facing an even stronger fear: \\"Seek ye, in the House of Leaves, a forge to form or break your spirit.\\" To all else: \\"Seek ye, elsewhere, your salvation.\\"<br /><br />who now, here, ~ has walked the halls ~ that wind within ~ the House of Leaves?the deceased, claims that this record is a lie.

Good GRIEF this movie is boring, tried several times on two consecutive nights to sit through it and....zzzzzzz....oh man, did I nod off AGAIN????<br />Incredibly stupid dialogue and insanely bad writing, historically hilarious, the worst sex scene in movie history, and generally the most intelligence-insulting film in recent memory.  This one is for fanboy man-boys only--and virtually no one else.  For those determined to see this stinker:  Good luck and SWEET DREAMS!!!
0783225733|5.0|I remember really liking this movie when it came out in 1995 - and now, more than 10 years later, I recently watched it on DVD with my kids.  I realize now why this is such a great movie - this isn't your typical movie that's \\"based on true events\\" or worse \\"inspired by true events\\".  The actual events were so incredibly dramatic that they didn't need to \\"Hollywoodize\\" the story.  You really feel like you are there, living the events that shook the nation when Apollo 13 almost didn't return.  Sure, the casting, the production, the effects, and the acting are top notch. But it really is the screenplay that makes this movie such a success - because the actual story is just so good that they didn't need to screw it up.

0553383663|5.0|This book was a true delight to read! This was so much more than just how two guys from college created a successful company. It was more than that. Those guys were turned away from Alta Vista, Excite, and Yahoo and had suffered disappointment after disappointment but never gave up. Their product (almost overnight) grew to be a massive empire once they got an investor to give $100k to their company. What I LOVED about this book was watching two easy-fun loving guys (who skateboard at their office in jeans and t-shirt) who continued to look to the future in the face of defeat. These guys never gave up and I, for one, was truly inspired after reading the book.<br /><br />The back-story of how google came to be can be described as the underdog finally reaching the top and overtaking those who turned him down.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I don't say that lightly either. This show is the best thing television has had to offer. It was years ahead of it's time! 17 years later it still stands up completely. I disagree about the second season being weak. It's just different than the first season. I happen to love the second season, and the last episode is anything but flawed!!!!!!! I'd go as far to say as it's probably one of the best episodes of the entire series!!!!<br /><br />If you've never seen Twin Peaks, do yourself a favor and watch it! Mostly since it's FINALLY available with the pilot!!!!!!!! If you have seen it, grab yourself a damn fine cup of coffee, some cherry pie and rewatch the magic!

A MUST READ!!  The best book I've read in a long time!!!  BTW, I think it would make a great movie! :)
B000QUCNOK|5.0|an ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT movie ~ Ben Wishaw as our hapless hero[?] reminds strongly of Tony Perkins and Tom Courtnay, but what a delightful and subtle performance!  Inspiration dabs of Tony Perkins [as Norman 'u know who'with that killer smile] and Jerry Lewis [the gait!]  [This boy is literally rail-thin - without being emaciated - defining Spartan life as luxurious when we discover his circumstances].<br /><br />The look, texture, feel and humor of the film [although in English] is essentially French, and what a period of devine filth - one can only but imagine the stench of the big cities during summer, although Veni ....

B00005JNTX|2.0|...the rest of us skip this movie.  I'll admit the best thing about the movie is the way it looks.  Rodriguez did an excellenct job in bring a comic book to life.  However, some things need to stick to their original medium.  I'm counting these illogical wrecks of mini-stories as those that fit in this catagory.  After Micky Rourke's short (the best one, IMHO) I was ready for this movie to end.  Clive Owens seemed miscasted, but Benico sort of saved the day on that story, but it was still riding on the so-so part.  After that, I'm thinking surely that's the end...BUT NO.  It keeps going and going, until I'm practically begging the DVD player, please no more.  Then there's just one more bit, that I was so close to pulling my hair out, that I was relieved that it only lasted less than a minute.  Oh, Thank God.  If over the top violence is what gets you off, then this is the movie for you.  If not, please, please avoid this movie.
B00005JPRV|5.0|I live in Utah and visit several sundance films every season.  This was by far my favorite of the '07 season.  very non mainstream and not promoted for the festival at all.  Saw it as the plot sounded interesting.    Aside from the movie just leaving you with an overwhelming sense of hope and optimism despite whatever type of desparity you may be going through, the movie is just well made.  The black and white fits the setting perfectly and giving it a very timeless look to the entire movie.  Good acting and the plot is very well placed without having any gaps in the flow of the movie.  I am anxiously waiting the release of this DVD.  I do not purchase many DVD but this one is already to be on my top 25 all time list.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|A very brief summary of my musical taste:<br />I love metal (including progressive metal like Opeth or Vintersorg)...<br />I don't love progressive rock (Rush, Genesis, etc...)<br /><br />If you have a musical taste similar to mine, and are curious about DT, then you should get this album... and stop there. I had been curious about DT for a while, since they are lauded by so many metal fans and music fans in general. I started with this one because it is described as \\"the heavy DT album.\\" Well, I liked it quite a bit; enough to then buy Awake and Scenes from a Memory... both of which were quite a disappointment for me. I will be selling them.<br /><br />So, this review is not for established DT fans, but for those who like metal and are curious about DT: Train of Thought is not at all heavy as far as metal in general goes, but it IS the only DT album I've heard that can even be called metal. It's quite enjoyable. I do recommend it... but a warning, don't go getting the other DT albums afterwards thinking they will sound like this one!
079073639X|1.0|This is an unbelievably bad movie and the actors who appeared in it aught to be ashamed and sue to have their names taken off it.  You know when the best scene of a movie is Queen Latifa being eaten by jellyfish, you have a real steaming pile on your hands.    Of all the movies I have seen, this one rates a place in my top ten WORST of all time.  DO NOT buy this thing, whatever you do.

B000LRY9PY|5.0|I only wish the rating system went beyond 5 stars. I LOVE THIS CD.  I will admit that with the video release of Put Your Records On, I was intent about hating the song. Everytime I turned to the video channel it seemed this video with this woman with this huge smile was staring at me. Just what did she have to smile about? Then, the video for Like A Star was released and I had yet to actually watch the video or listen to the song but the feel of the song was enough to make me take a leap of faith to purchase the CD. It was the best Cd purchse I've ever made, it's in my changer now. Now, Put Your Records On is on one of my faves. it is so rare to find a CD where every cut is brilliant. First, I was wanted to keep Corrine as my little secret, now I give the disc as gifts. Admittedly, there are people who weren't immediately on board, with the music. Today, we are so accustomed to all of the music sounding like the last song we heard. There is no one to compare Corrine to. If you wanna shake your booty buy Beyonce. If you want an experience purchase Corrine Bailey Rae.  Take a Sunday drive and take Corrine along.
0440238609|4.0|This is a great series if you like magic, parallel worlds, talking animals, and lots of action. The first book The Godlen Compass is coming out in movie form in December, so it helps to be prepared by knowing the plot and characters. I am not sure if this movie is only the first book or the entire trilogy.    I abhor people who tell too much of the plot in reviews, so I have not given anything away in this review.     Basically, a young girl unaware of her special abilities and true parentage is involved in myriad escapades with and without human / animal companions. Of course, evil exists and tries to thwart her at every turn as she tries to make the right choices.  The secret is that she must find her own way without anyone telling her what to do, or she will not be able to save the world. Apparently, everyone magical and non-magical knows that she is a special person. Magical DUST (which represents the life force for GOOD) is almost another character in this series. It  known only by \\"special\\" people who have plans to use it for pleasant and unpleasant ends.     The Golden Compass is a compass that only tells the truth through hands that move through a variety of symbols, each of which have many layers of meaning. It is the last remaining compass like this in the world and the main character not only has it, but is able to read it without the normal years of training and the \\"how to\\" book.     The Subtle Knife is a knife that can cut windows from one world into the next and can only be wielded by someone that the knife chooses. A male child companion of the main character is eventually the possessor of this powerful knife which is also deadly against all types of magical villans. Of course, everyone wants to possess this knife!!    The Amber Spyglass is a scientific invention built to identify and determine \\"up close\\" what DUST actually is and why the world is coming to a bad end without it. This magic DUST of good life feelings and actions is pouring out of allthe worlds, leaving only BAD people to be in charge...unless someone can change this scenerio.    This is an enjoyable series with very creative situations and characters. The action is non-stop and harrowing most of the time. However, if you have any strong Christian religious beliefs, you might be upset at how creation, life, death, and religion are portrayed throughout this series.

B000286RKW|5.0|The argument for the best mob movie ever can made endlessly.  [[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather DVD Collection]], [[ASIN:B000GGSMB2 Scarface (Platinum Edition)]], Goodfellas, [[ASIN:B000C20VPA Casino]], even [[ASIN:B00008RH3L Miller's Crossing]] gets mentions.  But Goodfellas is my favorite movie and the best ever to accurately depict the mob at it's best.    This is the tale of a rise to power for one man and it all being snatched away from him.  One of the best movies of all time.    Included are some nice Special Features.    Two commentary tracks:  - Martin Scorsese,Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Thelma Schoonmaker, etc.  - Henry Hill and the agent that arrested him/    Four Feauterettes.  Theatrical Trailer.    Pick this up.  You won't be disappointed.
0143034901|2.0|I was surprised to read other reviews of how great this book was and how unforgettable.  When our Book Club decided to read this,  I started to read it and realized I had already read it.  It was COMPLETELY forgettable.  The tracking of characters  took skill and charting by the reader with convoluted  twists and turns,  not always easily understood.  For some reason,  I found the book dark and not compelling.  I would not recommend!

B000ROALCG|5.0|I'm tired of bad-sport Hector Lavoe fans who cannot accept that anyone can even come close to challenging him.    Hector Lavoe was a master sonero, and he conveyed a sense of humor in his singing that was very unique.  Marc Anthony can't touch him in these departments.  However, Hector sometimes had an unpleasant nasal quality to his voice, and not much power.        Marc Anthony has a beautiful singing voice.  He sings with power and intensity, but can also handle the vocal acrobatics.    The musicians on this CD are excellent, and the arrangements are hot!!!  The more you listen to this CD, the more fun it is!    This should be just a starter for Hector Lavoe appreciation.  Hector had a prolific career with LOTS of great material.
B000P0J024|5.0|I found the Wilbury's cd/dvd set to be a journey of five of our most treasured artists who gathered under the helm of the the master guitarist George Harrison an ex Beatle with unfinished business and in this gathering he found that he could set the record straight, with his comrades under the banner of \\"The Travelling  Wilbury's\\" nothing was left to pass he captured the heart of the beatles in a surealistic way that Im sure he thought had been lost. The tunes are simple and completely innocent with no other reason than to make music as it used to sound and offered us all a snap shot of the past from all five members, in a word spectacular
B00005JPQL|5.0|I thought this was absolutely amazing. The parts that were changed to adapt it to the big screen were done well, without changing anything important or changing the feel of the movie. I've been a Neil Gaiman fan for years, so there was never any question about going to see it, but I had many friends who thought I would be disappointed. Not only was I not disappointed, it's been added to the top of my 'favorite movies of all time' list. And everyone I've talked to who's seen it has been likewise enchanted.

B000002JS6|5.0|This CD is a classic from one of Rock & Roll's greatest bands. Every song on this CD is outstanding and kicks butt. The CD starts out with \\"Hells Bells\\". This song starts out with church bells and goes right into some of the best guitar work of any band in the history of rock. \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" another butt kicking song and a fast paced song to sure get your foot a tapping and your body to want to dance. \\"Given The Dog A Bone\\" is another good song with good guitar lyrics. The classic \\"Back In Black\\" also has good guitar playing. The classic song and their signature song that is played more than any other song by AC/DC is \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". It is probably played and requested a lot at parties and at bars. \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" a drinking anthem for party people is a great party song. Another dance song is \\"Shake A Leg\\". Brian Johnson does as good of a job as Bon Scott on this CD. Don't get me wrong because nobody can take the place of Bon Scott. This is the first CD from AC/DC to feature Brian Johnson as lead singer. AC/DC will never be replaced by any band throughout the history on rock. ROCK ON AC/DC!!! It is ironic that this CD would be called Back In Black. I suppose it is because they are back in black with a new lead singer.
0895260131|5.0|Spencer pulls no punches. His work is laboriously researched and carefully sourced. He reveals what muslims don't want the rest of the world to know--that their religion is evil, violent and intentionally deceptive from it's inception. He also does an excellent job of debunking the currently circulating myths of the Christian Crusades--that they were nothing more or less than murderous rampages against poor, defenseless muslims. He demonstrates the true purpose and method of those necessary missions. He wisely calls for a revival of the crusade mindset when dealing with this most vile threat to ALL civilization--islam. This book should be required reading for every journalist before they write another word in defense of the blood-thirsty politi-cult from Mecca. It should be required for every elected official in America--especially those who continually mislabel islam as a \\"peaceful\\" religion. Pray for Robert Spencer--that the vampires of islam don't get to him before he can wake up the West.
0316067598|4.0|Mixed emotions about this book. A Special Forces guy I used to know once told me that SEALs are great in maritime environments but not trained to handle mountain warfare. Perhaps this is why we've seen so many stories like Luttrell's: SEALs outgunned, out-maneuvered, and desperately calling for help. Still you can't argue with the courage of Luttrell and his teammates. They fought with honor.     What you can argue about are Luttrell's endless complaints about Rules of Engagement, the liberal press, and all the rest of that conservative drivel. For the truth is, had they shot those unarmed goatherds, a bad idea if there ever was one (an dead unarmed fourteen-year-old makes a hell of an al Qaeda recruiting poster), it wouldn't have been the liberal press that would have hung Luttrell and his team out to dry so much as the Bush Administration running for cover.     It's also shocking that Luttrell apparently knows so little about the ideals set forth by the Founding Fathers who were Lockean liberals to a man. (\\"Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness\\" and the separation of church and state are the core ideals of liberalism-- always have been, always will be.) That these ideas were violently opposed by 18th century conservatives whose faith-and-tradition philosophies are being resurrected today is only one of the unintended ironies of Luttrell's book.     Also ironic is the photograph that depicts Luttrell smiling as Bush presents him with the Navy Cross. As one who witnessed at the collapse of the Twin Towers and the death of nearly three thousand Americans, among them a friend who, apart from being a great guy, left behind two daughters who will grow up with no living memory of their father, I can say without reservation that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have failed to do them justice.     I can also say as one who has had a family member serve in Iraq that the same injustice applies to the American dead and wounded. For the fact remains that six years after 9/11 Osama Bin Laden still remains at large. And by invading Iraq and botching the war, the Bush Administration has played directly into his hands.
0812975219|5.0|People hate this book because they are afraid of uncertainity. They got used to the books on how to become a CEO or how to get rich and retire young. They seek in books simple rules to follow and suddenly they get confronted with a book which doesn't offer \\"10 simple rules to take you to the top\\" but on the contrary, which shakes the foundations of this \\"work hard and get rich\\" psychology created and spread over the world by protestant thinking american minds.    By no means the author pretends to teach someone a lesson, or to impose his theory onto our minds. I would rather compare him to a weatherman, who tells you in the morning that it will rain, and whether you will take your umbrella or prefer raindrops falling on your head, this decision is up to you.    This book is like a breath of fresh air from an open window in an air-conditioned and sterilized world. It will not solve your problems, but it will make you to start thinking on your own. If this is important for you, buy and read this book, you won't regret it.

B00005JPQR|4.0|I will spare you the obligatory synopsis that seems to be all that qualifies as a review on this site. Since when did \\"transcription\\" become \\"review\\" anyway?  Who wants to read every minute detail about a movie before they go see it? Not me.    So, with that in mind I can only say that this movie can definitely hold it's own in the Bourne series of films. There is quite literally never a dull moment. Sure, some fistfights linger on a bit and the survivability of some characters defies reason, but if all films held to reality, movie going would be a miserably boring endeavor.    Matt Damon has grown into this role admirably. When one watches the Trilogy (I see a #4 coming) in order, you can see him gain confidence as an actor and quite literally fill out the character of Jason Bourne exceptionally well. He's great to watch in this, I never felt the urge to cringe, unlike while watching some of his earlier efforts. He seems like a likeable guy and brings a \\"human\\" element to Bourne that is needed because frankly, without that he'd be a quasi-superhero.     A word of caution about this film: There is a LOT of herky-jerky \\"wobble-cam\\" usage. (come to think of it, I can't recall a single still frame!)That, along with the whip-pans and high speed zoom-in and outs makes for a real headache inducing visual experience. Sit a little further back than you'd normally sit, your eyes (and stomach) will thank you.     It's a great movie. I just got out of the 2:15 showing and I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I rarely get that feeling from a movie. I hope the DVD has some behind-the scenes extras because some of the shots they got in this film were amazing, not to mention some of the stunts.     I would have given it 5 stars but the wobble-cam detracted from the experience a little for me.
1577312082|5.0|Please buy this material, and let the CLARITY of the message sink in.  Like many great teachers and authors, such as Deepak Chopra, this book leads the reader to make 2 steps 1) Gain a conceptual understanding of why we think we are separate from others, and 2) How to take action to prove to yourself that you are not.  I can tell all the readers that these actions will absolutely lead them to states of higher spirituality, and deeper peace in their lives.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|Hey folks, I am writing this from the desert of Iraq. In 2004-2005 I was in Iraq on my first tour and I bought The System has Failed at the PX. Yesterday United Aboninations finally became available at the PX on Al Asad. Of course I grabbed it, barely looking at the album cover.<br /><br />Well I see that Vic Rattlehead has had an upgrade of sorts. Instead of a skeleton, he now resembles a lobotomized human. Pretty cool I guess.<br /><br />I've been listening to this album for two days straight and I have to admit it took a little while to grow on me. That's how it is with me and Megadeth. For me there are two types of Megadeth albums, the first type is the one that grabs you by the throat and you love the album at first listen. For me that would be the first three albums and The System has Failed. Then there are the other types where it takes me a while to get into. Those for me were the 90's albums, and it seems United Abominations.<br /><br />If you are a Megadeth fan, you have to be a Dave Mustaine fan. Let's face it Dave IS Megadeth, Dave IS Vic Rattlehead. Junior is long gone folks. Love him or hate him, Dave deserves respect for all he has done for metal. His contributions are enormous. I am a guitar player and guitar freak anyway, so when I buy or listen to a Megadeth album, to me it's all about the guitar work. This is what Dave does best, his singing is secondary. Dave does NOT disappoint on United Abominations. His chops, riffs, and solos are as top notch as ever. He still dominates the fretboard. So there was no disappointment there.<br /><br />Dave's voice is the same as it has always been. Great singer? No. But he never was anyway. Dave's voice is just a tool to deliver the message, that's it. This album is chock full of warfare, corruption, and the Apocalypse (it's Megadeth, what did you expect?). I really dig the vibe and atmosphere on the song \\"Blessed are the Dead\\" as he presented his vision of the Four Horsemen.<br /><br />I do like this album. But after you listen to it, no songs really stand out. You listen to the whole album and remember very little of it. There is just no big impact. With The System has Failed I could stand in line at the chowhall and sing 'Kick the Chair' to myself, but United Abominations has no anthems so to speak.<br /><br />Again I've only had this album for two days, but I can already tell that this album will take time to grow on me. I'll probably appreciate it more if I can find some guitar tabulature for it. And one more thing, thank God Dave is still carrying the torch of REAL metal. This IS a REAL metal album. It is not fair, but Megadeth released a decent album on Roadrunner records and it will probably sell 200,000 units worldwide. Meanwhile Metallica is getting ready to release another abortion of an album this year that sheep will buy and it will go platinum, go figure. But most metalheads see that Metallica cannot compete with Megadeth anymore. Metallica ruled the 80's, but life is a marathon, and Megadeth is WAY out in front while Metallica is deciding on how to record St. Anger II without a therapist.y stand out.

0316067598|5.0|Their are still true patriots in our country, willing to sacrifice all they have for the freedoms we enjoy. They sacrifice family time, and themselves selflessly, enduring hardships that the average american has no concept of. God Bless our troops and God Bless America!! This book is probably one account of hundreds, if not thousands of examples, of men and women in our military putting country ahead of their own lives. Everyone reading this book should ponder if they have what it takes to do the same. Be thankful that their are those that do.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I have had an HP-12C for a long, long time.  It still works great but when I recently wanted a new calculator I decided to try something different.  I had already picked up an HP-10B over the years (which I also loved), but I read on-line that the quality of that calculator had gone downhill, so I decided to save some money in comparison to the HP-12C and try an Texas Instruments BAII Plus.  Bad idea.  While it had good weight and a solid feel, I found I was constantly pressing numbers without them being entered unless I really concentrated. Also, the interface on common functions was enough different from the HP-12C to require an adjustment. So I went back to the HP-12C, this time the Platinum addition.  Far improved speed from my old 12C, a backspace key and the ability to (if I were inclined) to change to algebraic number entry.  A different feel from old 12C but still solid keys and no data entry errors.  Definitely worth the price!

B00005JPMZ|5.0|I always enjoyed the origninal Turtle cartoon, wasn't much into the toys, and the original movies, although fun, were kinda corny. But this newest saga in the Turtles quest, simply called TNMT, has been advertised for a couple of years, and now has finally come to pass, and it is killer. Classic turtle fighting, with some drama. The family isn't such a happy family, as Leonardo has left for an extended training to become a better leader, leaving the other turtles to fend for themselves...in the real world.  Donnatello does phone computer supportand young michelangelo does birthday parties as a giant turtle, go figure.  Will Leonardo find his way and return to his brothers, and will his brothers accept him again.  And will everything work out as a new great terror is about to destroy the earth.   Just get thsi film.  This is by far the most advanced CGI movie to date.  Just great angles and details.  I can only dream of what the future may hold in CGI, but if this film is just a shimmer of it...were in for some great films.   Must have for turtle fans, old and new alike.
0595440096|5.0|This story deeply touched my heart. I couldn't put it down. Lisa Genova gives us such a revelation of what a person goes through on their journey down the road to dementia. It was at once interesting, entertaining, and informative, but mostly it tugged at my heart. I could feel Alice's confusion; I wept for Alice and her family, but I rejoiced in the love and care shown to her.  I highly recommend this book .. a \\"must read\\"!!

0767802519|4.0|The Professional is an interesting movie. It's gritty, oddly matched characters and colors present something...odd. Leon is lovable...he is sexy and kind and hilarious, while still retaining the sadness that is due him, anywhere from watching Gene Kelly with ardour to his sleeping habits. Gary Oldman is a little over the top, but he's still good and creepy, while being a believable drug addict. Natalie Portman is a brat...her swearing was annoying, her dressing ridiculously provocative at points, her attitude unbearable, and her penchant for Jean Reno, or Leon, extremely creepy sometimes (such as wearing his underwear to bed, telling the hotel manager that Leon was her lover, and telling him she was falling in love with him while they zoomed in on her stomach). The storyline was good, and thankfully they kept Leon refreshingly not-turned-on by her attempts to be close to him. It stays platonic enough to be enjoyable at parts, but Mathilda (Natalie Portman) was over the top and pervertedly provocative, such as dancing in a bra and thong-over-tights while singing \\"You Make Me Feel Like a Virgin\\" to Leon. Thankfully Leon is just respectable and kind.   The storyline is sad, such as Leon worked for years and years killing while being used by his \\"friend\\" Tony, then Mathilda being denied the money Leon desired her to have. The ending was extremely sad, but thankfully one gets the impression Mathilda will become better later in life.   In Ronin, it is pointed out during director commentary how hard it is and what a beautiful thing it is to make a set look lived in or old and cruddy. They achieve this grittiness to perfection in The Professional, with all the different apartments Mathilda forces them to move in to. The clothes, unfortunately, excepting Leons, seem to hark back to mid-80s rather than mid-90s.   Jean Reno was absolutely fantastic, lovable, and sympathetic as a man learning to live again, while still being able to kill. He's smart, he just seems to have turned off his human side too long. Gary Oldman is creepy, a little over the top, but hateful in the good way while having his own almost endearing nuances. Mathilda is extremely annoying and creepy, but after watching it twice she did not bug me as much as the first time. She's extremely believable in her idiocy.   It was a good movie, Jean Reno was fantastic, however it is not a feel good movie, nor does it have crazy fighting sequences, though the ones they do have are good. A good movie to watch Jean Reno in.
B00005YUPO|3.0|I watched this dvd with my 11 month old. It was ok, but she didn't seem as interested in it as the other Baby Einstein movies that we have. It just didn't grab her attention like some of the others.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Cage's nor do I typically like comic to movie conversions, but I actually enjoyed this film! I thought Cage did well as stuntman Johnny Blaze, and I thought the CGI ghost rider looked pretty cool. I was sort of Meh about the romantic subplot but overall I found this a fast-paced entertaining film.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|When \\"Karate Kid\\" first showed up in theatres, \\"Ghostbusters\\" was right there in competition with it! My mom told my buddy and I that we had a choice of one or the other. Well, right away we said, \\"Ghostbusters!\\" We knew that the other movie was popular, but not this time. Well, a year or two after it was released, I spent the night at another friend's house, and \\"Karate Kid\\" was highly recommended. When my family moved, and Karate Kid II came to the theatres, we were in line for tickets! I always enjoyed it, and when I heard it was to be a box set, I decided to get the collection. Whether you get this for, \\"Wax on, wax off!\\", \\"Paint the fence.\\", \\"Finish him, Johnny!! Get him a body bag!\\", or whether you just enjoy Miyagi, it isn't disappointing. But there are setbacks. All in all, I thought it was indeed a 5 star collection. Here are the movies, with some brief thoughts.<br /><br />The Karate Kid: Well, this is where it all begins! This is where Daniel moves with mother (Ma) from New Jersey to California. This is where a young man finds a mentor in an older maintenance man named Miyagi. This is the beginning of a confrontation between Daniel and a gang called Cobra Kai. This is where Daniel learns the Karate that Miyagi knows to love. The great thing about this is indeed the special features. Lots of cast and crew interviews, from a section dedicated to the music composed by Bill Conti. If this was the first movie you saw Pat Morita in, and you were only ten, were you fooled into thinking that he was a Karate expert, and not simply a comedian?! This is the beginning, and it is a classic!<br /><br />Karate Kid II: I personally thought this was just as good and the original. Miyagi goes to Okinawa for his sick and dying father, and Daniel joins him. As the subtitle states, \\"The story continues,\\" and Miyagi runs into an old foe, and Daniel confronts a whole new foe in the menacing nephew. Good story, lots of good stuff, great song by Peter Cetera to go along with it, (Glory of Love) and a movie that fans will love for years to come. Not as many special features, but still some good stuff.<br /><br />Karate Kid III: Back from Okinawa, back in the States! Somebody is looking to get even with Daniel and Miyagi. A grudge match between masters is in the making, and Daniel faces a most ruthless opponent!  If you are looking for lots of fights, III definitely dishes them out! By now, the ending is rather obvious. Consider this to be Daniel, with an even bigger attitude. Miyagi's lessons in this are beyond tournaments and trophies, and much more valuable. No real special features in this.<br /><br />The Next Karate Kid: Out with Ralph Macchio, in with Hilary Swank. Yuck! Ok, it wasn't too terrible. But there was nothing classic about it. Nothing I care to remember about this one really. There are some interesting scenes, but they fade away rather quickly. As the credits roll, you simply say, \\"Oh well. That's that.\\" And then you put it away. Not a total loss. No real special features.<br /><br />But hey, this is your collection. You can take it or leave it! It does have everything you could possibly want (or not possibly want) as fare as Karate Kid goes. For the most part, I really enjoy this collection!and a movie that fans will love for years to come.

B00005JPQR|5.0|This movie is excellent and does well in wrapping up the Jason Bourne story.  The directing is excellent and the action top-notch.  We finally learn how David Webb became Jason Bourne and what his mission was. It is nice to see Julia Styles in a bigger role as Nicki Parsons.  Pamela Landey is back too and her character is excellent.  There were several parts in the movie where I heard the audience cheering out loud.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Eric Church is an amazing talent. His music has a great connection to the listener. I love his voice. I own some cds where I will skip a track because I don't like it as much or I get tired of it. I never do this with Sinners Like Me, I listen to it straight through, cause its wonderful.
B000025XE5|5.0|This disc is incredible. It starts off with the Troggs biggest hit (and one of the most recognizable garage/punk sounds of the 60's) and then it gets better from there. How these guys weren't way bigger is certainly a mystery. True, \\"I Want You\\" is similar to \\"Wild Thing\\" the way the Kinks' \\"All Day and All of the Night\\" resembled \\"You Really Got Me\\", but they're all good tunes. \\"Gonna Make You\\" brings back memories of the McCoys hit, \\"I Want Candy\\" only this one has more bite. \\"665-4321\\" has a hard driving beat that you can't resist. The rockers dominate this CD, but the softer songs such as, \\"With a Girl Like You', \\"Anyway That You Want Me\\", and \\"Love Is All Around\\" are top notch. No dogs on this one!  If I could, I'd give it ten stars!
B000002H4C|5.0|It's my personal opinion, but I just love this cd.  It's now the third one I've purchased.  The first was a cassette.  They get worn out.  The second was a cd, but it got scratched up.  I had a hard time trying to find it, so I tried Amazon and \\"WAH LAH\\", of course they had it.  I hope it lasts, but if not, I now know where to get another one.    Thank you very much!!
0783116934|5.0|In the East, behind an Iron Curtain carved by the image of Stalin and the words \\"The Cold War\\" as they crept into the 80's, no Western diseases exist. There is no want or wantonness, no greed that exists under the curvature of a dollar-shaped crescent, and there certainly is nothing like the violence we - westerners - shape skulking the streets. That's what the people in charge have to say, anyhow, and that's the end-all to the debate. The problem is that everyone didn't get the memo and one man, an Andrei Chikatilo, finds himself basically left alone with his wanton needs and no one to acknowledge their existence. This goes on for eight-years, too, and the amount of people left in the wake of one nation's ignorance - it's amazingly horrific and then some.<br /><br />When this originally aired on HBO, I was surprised at how apt the story was told. Many people had heard about the thing that had happened behind the façade of Communism at the time, and many people had seen little snippets of what type of person was behind these crimes. But the things the movie revealed - they were chilling to see when played out on television and then some. Perhaps it was a number of things that added to this as well, highlighting not only the criminal himself but also the things that he had done. The removal of body parts with teeth, the way he stalked people and lured them in with shallow promises; it was terrifyingly surreal and yet it wasn't. Perhaps that's the part that was the most stunning of all; this wasn't based on a novel or on a fantasy. It was a tale about someone that really existed and really killed in ways far-more-graphic than even the scenes could attest to.<br /><br />With regard to the movie, I personally thought that the acting in the movie was superb and that the background was beautifully rendered. The movie didn't overdo what it was like to live in the Soviet Union and it didn't try to delve too deeply into the political intrigue that surrounded that moment in time. It looked into the moment instead with a curious \\"why,\\" picking at the things that were relevant to the movie, and highlighted those.<br />This made the movie even more frightening in that right, because people kept disappearing and bodies kept piling up and yet - and yet \\"nothing like that could happen.\\"<br /><br />If you want to see a movie about serial killers that reminds me of a cross between a docudrama and a somewhat terrifying glimpse into the past, this would be worth checking out. I was surprised by the detail put into it, the relevance that existed within the framework of the move, and the type of things that really can happen when people pretend that awful things don't occur.<br />It was well worth the watch.into the moment instead with a curious \\"why,\\" picking at the things that were relevant to the movie, and highlighted those.

B000AYQJ3I|5.0|After seeing this for the first time..  having never heard the concert.. having read quite a bit about it..  I came away realizing that George really knew how  to rock back in the day.. but here's the best part..     you know how the Beatles are sometimes knocked for being poppy  thanks to Paul... well friends, this is stripped down rootsy  music from the Beatles lead guitarist George Harrison and he  is in total command.. wow... it's as if you're seeing the Beatles   rocking out... (and George can actually play a little guitar unlike   Paul!) (Hey, I love Paul.. but let's face it... he can't touch  George on the guitar.)    George is just rocking out on guitar.. wow... I mean.. I know  this isn't the only best part of the concert but if you've  got some Beatle Haters... show them this!!!!    This concert is simply one of the finest demonstrations of musicians  coming together to help a cause.. with Dylan, Billy Preston, Badfinger,  Clapton.... come on... if you don't have this.. if you're a classic rock  fan.. I can't imagine it won't touch you.. it has certainly touched me.
B0007PAMR4|2.0|I saw this once; thought it was decent.  Then I read the book, and realised just how BAD it was in comparison.  It's now impossible for me to watch this and NOT think about what it could have been, if there'd been a genuine attempt to transfer the book's depth to the screen.<br /><br />Not bad if you've never read the book; but if you love good sci-fi, READ THE BOOK INSTEAD.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|It's just a movie!!!  Why pick it apart like you're looking for a tumor?  Whether this movie was based on actual events or not, it's beautifully made and the action was cool.  For those who can't see the forest for the trees, go grab a job application as a critic's office.
B00005JNS0|4.0|I kept putting off *Cars* because basically I don't care for NASCAR or any of that racing stuff.  However, when I saw *Cars* it wasn't so bad.<br /><br />When Lightning McQueen ties with 2 other cars in a racing competition, they must re-race at another location in California.  Overnight, while sleeping in a semi-truck, McQueen is lost in the middle of nowhere.  Not only is he lost but he's in trouble for damaging a road strip and is sentenced to repair the road.<br /><br />Trapped and angry about his potential loss of a championship and sponsorship, he soons learns that there's more to life than winning the cup.  He meets other cars and befriends them as well as getting interested with one of them.  Meanwhile, he discovers there's someone there that used to be a racer but has kept it a secret.<br /><br />Regardless of his friendship with everyone, McQueen still has to repair the road.  When he is done, he has to decide which is more important...the race or his new friends.<br /><br />Pixar still hasn't failed me.  Even though I'm not fond of car racing, *Cars* was still an entertaining watch.
B000P0I4O4|3.0|There were so many plot holes in this one that I had a very hard time sitting through it but Morgan Freeman and John Cusack are still worth watching. Even with mediocre material, they do their best to make films work and that is reason enough to watch this. Forget the rather blah plot and focus on them. I watched this movie more than once just to make sure I wasn't missing anything and in order to give the fairest review I could.<br /><br />  The plot, such as it is, centers on a man, Ray, (played by Cusack) who is trying to reach his son after the death of the boy's mother. They decide to go hiking, away from everything, giving them more chances to connect, or so Ray hopes.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, he manages to get dragged into the middle of a nightmarish experience with a contract killer and his intended victim. Freeman plays the contract killer and brings his usual complexity to the part, actually making the guy somewhat likable.<br /><br />  Ray overwhelms the killer and is planning to bring him to justice. This is where things go awry as there were so many instances where I saw opportunities for the killer to escape, take advantage of the situation or turn the tables - all straining viewer credibility.<br /><br />  You could do worse than to watch this, especially with two talented actors at the helm. But I'd wait for it to hit the small screen. Don't buy or rent it.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|For some reason, I thought that *Thank You for Smoking* was a documentary.  I don't know what led me to assume that.  So, it was a surprise for me, both in genre and the story.<br /><br />Nick Naylor is a spinner of a spokesperson for the tobacco industry.  He's so savvy with words that he could convince anyone that smoking is actually good for you.  Even if he doesn't necessarily believe it himself.<br /><br />Nick has everything going smoothly for him.  He meets once a week with 2 other lobbyists (guns and alcohol).  They call themselves \\"the MOD\\" (Merchants of Death).  He isn't afraid of his boss because he knows that THE man of tobacco (Duvall) has his back.  He's off to Hollywood to get cigarette smoking back on screen.<br /><br />The governor of Vermont (Macy) wants a televised political debate with him.  However, he needs leverage.  Unknown to the governor, a reporter (Holmes) wants to do an article on Naylor.  Drawn to her charm, wits and sexiness, he spills the beans to her.  Well...as long as he is getting a \\"side dish\\".  Of course, the reporter has an ulterior motive, which is to expose Naylor as who he really is.<br /><br />Predictably, things spiral down as soon as the article is released which contains secrets and identities of those behind the tobacco industry.  The governor just cannot wait to debate with Naylor as well as making him look like a fool.<br /><br />Can Naylor turn things around and save face as well as the tobacco industry?  Has the provobial cat gotten his tongue?<br /><br />I like *Thank You for Smoking* because it was stimulating for discussion with friends after the movie.  It just makes you wonder who is lobbying and are they lobbying for you or not.  In addition, you'll soon realize the looming and eminent presence of the tobacco industry in America.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I read all the reviews. I tried not to listen. I thought to myself, being \\"old\\" now (30) that the kids never give some different a fair shake. And like Metallica, I was wrong. This does not belong in the same category as previous works. I can understand bands wanting to branch out and do something different. Its hard to believe they play the same songs in concerts tour after tour after tour. But if you want to release an album for the John Tesh radio show, then lets market it straight to adult contemporary, shall we? Quit pretending you rock!
B00006CXSS|5.0|this is such a wonderful series.  should be required in all high schools in this country.  much of this history will be lost soon as we are losing WWII veterans every day
074356619X|5.0|I saw the video of The Secret first and was utterly impressed.  Thus I set out and got a copy of the audio book as well, so that I could listen to the inspiring message while driving or walking or falling asleep.  The audio book is read by the author (Rhonda Byrne) herself, and she has a pleasing, melodic voice that is a pleasure to listen to.  The audio book also contains the recorded quotations from the many exceptional contributing authors, and thus remains engaging and interesting throughout.  The message of The Secret is certainly not new and never-presented-before material, but it is a splendid and inspiring summary of \\"you create your own reality\\".  This audio book/video/book certainly does not provide irrefutable evidence to reason you into believing anything in particular. However, if you are along the path of spiritual growth, open to perceiving a truly boundless and amazing universe full of possibility, and keen to live your life in joy - then this audio book is certainly worth your time.
0446677450|5.0|This is NOT a well written piece of literature but rather a VALUABLE source of information that will change your perspective on money and working for it. It will enable you to 'think outside the box'-IF you are open-minded. I have passed it on to my family and friends. Wish I had known these concepts years ago!
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I first heard Paolo on a morning news show and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was mesmerized by his live version of Last Request and decided right then and there that I was going to support his talents by purchasing the album.  After finding out this kid was only 19 when he released this album was even more amazing.  He has the soul & song writing ability of a man twice, three times his age.      Usually an album will have songs I feel the need to skip over but not this one.  I can listen, feel and sing along with all of them.  I highly recommend this record.
B00005QAPH|3.0|You know when you watch a film where the characters are filmmakers, you've entered the vanity zone. It's just a basic conceit that anyone who wants to create should avoid... don't make the creation about the act of creating it.    Yet, time and again it's an irresistible lure... the grand tell-off tell-all that creative people can't resist. It always stinks, and this wasn't really an exception. Things are constantly \\"told\\" rather than shown... from politics, to philosophy, to love, this is more of a director's essay disguised as a story, than a story. Fellini throws in lively dream sequences, and tries to doll the whole thing up as a righteous attempt at clearing the skeletons out of his personal closet by blurring the lines of film and barely disguised confession. Yet, like any artistic adventure so audacious, in the end you feel a little sick that he felt the need to share so personally and so indifferently to the fact people might rather see a good plot, than the weak wailing of his self-abased soul.    For all that, the movie is rather beautiful sometimes, just in looks and music. I'm just at a loss as to where people think this even a \\"great\\" piece of art though. The revelations in it are nothing if not weak, and \\"The Director\\" in the fictional sense seems to make out ok in the end without truly atoning for a lifetime of treating his women like garbage.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I have tried many workout videos and this is my favorite by far. The moves are great, with aim at health for the entire body as well as burning calories. Great variety, Cindy's down-to earth, requires very little equiptment (just a pair of 3 or 5 lb weights.) Easy to pick up and do everyday for great energy. And lastly - in the past I have always winced when family members came in the living room while I was following a video - but no more. This is smoothe, professional, up-to-date, to the point and has decent, relaxing backround music.
0316067598|5.0|I really liked the recruiting commercial I used to see on TV for the Navy SEALs.  The announcer says \\"if somebody wrote a book about your life in 20 years, would anyone want to read it?\\"  I always thought that was a good point.  Sadly, you might have to write a book like this one.<br /><br />Candid, well written, and timely, this book will give you the story of a SEAL mission in Afghanistan that resulted in a major shootout high in the rugged Afghan mountains.  No matter what side of the war you are on, the book will give you insight into the life of a Navy SEAL.

1400079179|5.0|The Da Vinci Code. So much has been discussed about it - in all kinds of media.<br /><br />I bought this book when it was released and yes, I loved reading it. The mystery/adventure in this book all began with the murder of Louvre's chief curator and how he leaves clues for his granddaughter, Sophie, for the mystery to be solved. During solving the murder mystery, one clue leads to another. Sophie ultimately solves the mystery and a big secret is revealed.<br /><br />I am no expert in Christianity; so I cannot comment on any religious facts stated in the book. However, I must admit that it was while reading this book, did I get to know many facts. Dan Brown weaved many facts about Leonardo da Vinci, his works, about cryptography, and so on, that reading 'The Da Vinci Code' was a pleasure.<br /><br />It's in the hands of an author to weave facts with fiction in such a way that the author's works are a pleasure to read. And that's what exactly Dan Brown has done in this book.<br /><br />If you still haven't read the book, & have just \\"heard\\" the main story, I must suggest this book is a must read and to be kept as a collection. The book is far better than the movie too.
0743289684|5.0|this book explains in great detail the struggle to survive not just war, famine, displacement and clan battles but also chronicles the struggle to be one's own person. The author is bound by tradition of clan and religion and fights to express herself, make her own decisions concerning her own life and the implement them. However she runs afoul of her family, her clan and her religion. All three bring great force to bear and after suffering a severe beating, rejection by her father, being stalked by her family and death threats she goes on to achieve her educational goals, is elected to the Dutch parliament and fights for womens' rights. What an inpsiration she is! She also describes the islamic immigrant community in Holland and the Dutch government's failure to understand the need to integrate these people into Dutch society in spite of their rejection of the dutch way of life, freedom of speech and pursuit of personal happiness. However, she goes on to explain that they have no problem accepting free welfare, housing, education while despising the society and people who provide it. This is a real eye opener to all of the western world.
068485743X|4.0|Lukeman starts with some basic stuff agents use to quickly dismiss a manuscript, then he moves into the complicated areas that require a major manuscript overhaul if the error is committed. Broke into three parts, the books is well written (as a should be a book like this), well organized, and informative. And because he covers a wide scope of manuscript problems, this book helps the new novelist and the published veteran.  But it's not really the first five pages; sometimes it's the first five sentences or paragraphs. Other times it might be the first fifty pages.<br /><br />This is a \\"should read\\" for any writer wanting to land an agent.

Killer along with Love It To Death prove to be his best work.Being Killer is the subject,would have to point out Under My Wheels,Be My Lover,Halo Of Flies,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah and Dead Babies as the standouts.reall the whole album is great!!!! For those who are just familiar with Trash and on,should check this one out. Awesome and arguably his best!!!! You won't regret buying it and will listen a lot and a lot...A solid 5 for Awesome!!!!

1416914285|4.0|Sorry, perhaps I didn't annalyze the story as much as some of the other reviewers, but I thought it was a great book.  I do think it was definitely meant for teens.  It has the first love innocence about it and the hero has the \\"I'm indistructable\\" attitude that most teens have.  There were some funny parts (not lol, but funny), especially when they have to call someone to drive them to fight demons, because most of them don't have their license. My only complaint is that it was a bit slow in the beginning, but I thought it picked up steam as it went along.  The ending wasn't quite a shocker for me, I sort'a guessed at it, but it's one of those things that you hope you're wrong about.  I'm looking forward to reading the next installment and I hope all those negative reviews (coming from those who keep comparing this novel to other teen and kid novels) don't stop you from giving it a try.  Just be open-minded and remember, reading is suppose to be fun.
B0000AI45P|5.0|Often cited as one of the NYC bands that helped inspire the \\"punk rock\\" movement in the 70's, Television is typically lumped-in with the punk bands that followed, but this is a tragic mis-characterization. Television certainly shared some of punk's elements: spare instrumentation, raw youthful energy, and a \\"street rock\\" rejection of the overindulgences of 70s era musical and visual style. But unlike the bands that followed, Television did this with a keen musicianship, that was equal to the intensely inventive spirit of their songwriting. This is why their debut album still remains fresh today and deserves recognition as a unique document that has all the qualities of the highest forms of musical art. I fully expect that hundreds of years from now those interested in and knowledgeable about electric guitar music will still be listening to the work of Television while their contemporaries are long forgotten.    Perhaps it takes a musician to truly appreciate the sheer brilliance of Marquee Moon. The inventive guitar interplay of Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd over the equally inventive rhythmic foundation of drummer Billy Ficca and bassist Fred Smith puts every other rock foursome of the time to shame... both in sheer originality and musical sophistication. Most of the bands that followed eschewed serious musicianship and offered little more than youthful rebellion driven ever harder to a new level of speed, attitude, and volume. Television cracked open a door to a different kind of music, one that combined the raw attitude of rebellious youth, with a musical sophistication rivaling that of creative jazz, a fresh musical alchemy all their own that remains influential long after the raw appeal of punk has run its course.    For those looking for punk head-banging over densely hammering chords, this recording is not for you. For serious musicians and others interested in the deeper creative possibilities of guitar, bass, and drum rock music, Marquee Moon remains an essential and timeless artifact that defies categorization, and still inspires awe in Those Who Understand.
B00005JPFH|3.0|Being a long-time fan of comics, I secretly look forward to releases of movies based on comics -- no matter what the subject. And while most comic book movies in the past have been shredded to pieces by a majority of critics, the comic book movies today are often crafted so well that they most often receive critical acclaim. Case in point, 2002's \\"Spider-Man.\\" Everyone loved the origin story of Peter Parker and his struggles of responsibility with his power and trying to lead a normal life. Movie and comic geeks drooled over how well the movie stayed fairly close to the original comic. And usually I'd be with them. However, the first \\"Spider-Man\\" movie didn't \\"wow\\" me (I liked \\"Spidey 2\\" more), say, the way the original 1989 \\"Batman\\" movie did. Maybe it was because I've always been a bigger fan of Batman than I have Spider-Man, but, regardless, I just thought Batman was a better movie. Now comes the part of this review where you, the reader, say, \\"Are you kidding me? Spider-Man stayed more true to the comic and appealed to a much broader audience!\\" Well, of course Spider-Man appeals to more people, he's your everyman. I mean, seriously, who can relate to an orphaned kid who grows up to be a billionaire playboy? Not many. But that's what I loved about Batman; it was easier for me to accept that story of someone that insanely rich becoming that character as opposed to some dorky kid -- which I was myself in high school -- gaining some superpowers from a spiderbite. I mean, dorky kids don't get those powers and they don't get the girl. I did go on to write a novel that followed along those same lines of an outcast obtaining a \\"superpower\\" as a result of a prank, but the ending in my book differs greatly from that of Spider-Man. Now, I know, I know. This is a comic. A medium where most guys/girls can escape the harsh reality of life and become engrossed in fantasy. But that's not how I rolled in high school. I wanted reality. And while a billionaire obtaining high-tech gadgetry and becoming a masked vigilante isn't all that real, it's certainly easier to accept than some dorky kid becoming a masked hero and getting a variety of hot, young babes.<br /><br />Now, on to my second point, 2002's \\"Spider-Man\\" is closer to the origin story whereas 1989's \\"Batman\\" had the audacity of making The Joker the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents. Well, anyone who's a Batman fan/reader can tell you that the man who murdered Wayne's parents was a common thug named Joe Chill. And that made most comic fans blast \\"Batman\\" the movie. That's why in 2005's \\"Batman Begins,\\" fans cheered when Hollywood finally got it right. Well, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" has gone from that upstanding critics fave comic movie to the same formula that had fans blast 1989's Batman. Didn't anyone tell Sam Raimi that you're supposed to improve your screenwriting as you go and not demote it?<br /><br />\\"Spider-Man 3\\" insults fans' intelligence by making Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman the killer of Uncle Ben Parker. Wow! That must sting to all those critics who blasted \\"Batman\\" for not sticking true to the origin. But now, even those critics are praising \\"Spider-Man 3\\" simply on its special FX. Oh, the hypocrisy. And then, to make matters worse, they give Marko a wife/girlfriend and ill daughter in an attempt to have the audience feel more sorry for him, which also is definitely not true to the original. Why the sudden need to have villains appear as wussies? Seriously. I know the filmmakers want to get the audience to say, \\"Oh, well, he's bad, but for a good reason.\\" No! That's not how it is and not how it should be portrayed on film! While I don't mind a little creative liberty, there's still a fine line that you shouldn't go past. And \\"Spider-Man 3\\" definitely went over and beyond that line. They did the same thing with 2004's \\"Spider-Man 2,\\" making Doctor Octopus some poor, unfortunate character who lost his wife in a lab accident he caused. Yeah, that's not the story! At least in the wretched 1997 sequel \\"Batman & Robin,\\" the writers got the origin of Mr. Freeze right. No, no, no! Both Sandman and Doc Ock are hardass criminals, not misunderstood, heart-of-gold men! And that's how they should be portrayed in the movies. Now, as for Edward Brock Jr. and Venom, THAT they got right!!! Now, if you want a villain to feel sorry for, instead of Sandman, they should have incorporated The Lizard, who the filmmakers had a great opportunity to exploit as his alter ego Dr. Curt Connors is portrayed in the films by the excellent Dylan Baker. Also, The Lizard would've been a better choice seeing how he has that whole Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde persona that would've paralleled perfectly with the Spidey red suit/black suit persona storyline that Parker struggles with in this film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, overall, I enjoyed \\"Spider-Man 3\\" and found it was a thrill to see in the theater. But while the first two at least held a solid-built story, this one seemed a lot more choppy in parts. Because of its extreme attempt at jamming so much Spider-Man lore into one movie, it lacked that feeling of a complete story with a good amount of focus on each character. A good example are the use of Gwen Stacy and her father Police Captain George Stacy, played by the illuminating Bryce Dallas Howard and the talented James Cromwell, respectively. In fact, they're hardly used at all in the film! Which is a further insult to fans seeing how Gwen Stacy was Peter Parker's first major love and is so crucial to the storyline of Spider-Man. And to think that in Spider-Man 3 she is merely used as an insulting plot device to make Mary Jane jealous!? What an insult and what a waste.<br /><br />It's a bold move for Raimi to tackle so many story lines such as the Venom symbiote and therefore introducing Eddie Brock, the ongoing troubled relationship with M.J., the troubled friendship with Harry Osborn, Peter dealing with his feelings about his Uncle Ben's death, entering a new villain Sandman, and introducing Gwen Stacy and her father George. However, it was a bit too much. This movie had its funny moments (which come off completely dorky like the true character of Peter Parker and the comic), but it also had its scary moments. And while the two villains seem like a mere sidenote in this movie (not being as developed as previous villains Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus), the filmmakers are safe because, after all, the trailer does say that the main villain in this story is Parker's inner darkness. Like I said, this review may sound like an attack but it's just a warning to fellow fans/readers that it's not true to the original story. Now, moviegoers who don't know the comic that well (and only know the Spidey movies) will probably like this movie a lot. But it's not the dazzling story that's been originally written over the years and is an insult to true fans' intelligence.<br /><br />Overall, as a film, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" works and I'm amazed at how brilliantly the FX crews can bring Spidey's web-slinging adventures to the screen. The performances by Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Topher Grace, and especially James Franco (who STOLE this movie) are great, but, unfortunately, Howard, Cromwell and especially Church (who had a very limited amount of dialogue) were wasted in this film. The writing was off in comparing to the previous two films but the overall plot is interesting enough to keep audiences jamming the theaters for the next month or so. Bottom line: Although enjoyable, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is a big movie, and that may ultimately be its problem.\\"Batman & Robin,\\" the writers got the origin of Mr. Freeze right. No, no, no!

1400079276|3.0|This is the first time I've read Murakami. I'll give him another chance, as there are parts of this novel that were brilliant. A good chunk of it, unfortunately, was exceedingly pedantic.    The first third was interesting enough, and though I've learned to avoid anything that smacks of 'magic realism' I found that my favorite character was the Siamese, Mimi. I got caught up in the author's dream-like imagery. Murakami builds tension and mystery ...    ... and then drops it all unexpectedly. A good third of the book consists of characters trading monologues on metaphor, the nature of genius, the nature of the soul, the nature of identity, et cetera and ad nauseam. The latter part is one soliloquy after another. None of these speeches were even in character - a fifteen year old runaway, a disembodied spirit, a truck driver, a fifty year old woman, and a mentally disabled old man all spoke with the same dull academic voice.  It was maddening.  I would have quit the book if the first half hadn't been so well written.    Murakami recovers in the final chapters, but the novel would have been stronger with a good 100 pages shaved off.

B000092EMQ|5.0|'When Seconds Count' is another fine 80's pop\rock LP, one of my favorites, in 1986 'Is This Love' was one of my favorite songs! (still is!) Love Jimi Jamison's vocals on this record! Strong material and playing, thank you Survivor for this one!
B000J10EQU|2.0|I really looked forward to this movie, but was totally disappointed in the end. I would give this 2 1/2 (maybe 3) stars at best. Brandon Routh makes for a very handsome Superman, but he was too boring even for Clark's role. Bosworth just made me cringe as Lois. She didn't have the spunk or the look. She was boring as were her boyfriend and kid. The best cast roles were Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey as Luther and Kitty. They added some fun to this dull flick, but it's a little sad when you think that Kitty stole the show.    It was still worth watching if you love Superman, just because it's a Superman movie.    The effects were wonderful, the logic of the plot and action was totally flawed, and many of the lines were cheesy...but not in a fun way. This movie made me wish for the good old Superman of the 80s.
B000003TA4|5.0|Kurt Cobain is a legend, and with this major label debut, they erupted out of the Seattle music scene, creating anthems that every teenager of the 90s knew by heart.    \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is one of the catchiest songs of all time.  \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", \\"Lithium\\", \\"Breed\\", and \\"On A Plain\\" have gone down as classics. Anyone that loves rock music needs to own this album.  While I believe that bands like Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, and Stone Temple Pilots were all better bands, Nirvana created their share of classic tunes and helped popularize grunge music, almost single-handedly. They were the coolest band around back in the day, and eveyone had a Nirvana t-shirt. Buy this cd immediately, and also In Utero.
B00000IQW3|5.0|Good Lord, run right out and get it. If you love the 80's and the glorious fun movies of a gone era. Great story and a true classic. Not too hokey kind of in the guise of Cloke and Dagger and War Games. Good acting, \\"From the Humans\\". Truely a rightous movie for the Uber collector!
0812932293|5.0|Very enjoyable read. He does not give you any great business insight, but it is an uplifting and encouraging story.
B000002L68|5.0|Despite the film, excellent music.  It is Prince at his more commercial, but the music is still fantastic.
0374105235|5.0|I really enjoyed reading about what Ishmael had to go through, even though it was very disturbing at times.  His story is told in a casual easy way. I wanted to read more about what he thought about the way Americans live...  I'm glad he got to escape and I am just shocked at how the world lets these civil wars go on and no other countries government gets involved. Its very sad. I'm also greatful about Sierra Leone and its people, cultures and values in that country.  An all around excellent book and author.   Hopefully Ishmael will continue writing.
B000002KLP|4.0|I love this era of Prince.  He'd established himself as a brilliant musician prior to this release, and he'd not been very shy in doing so.  On this one, though, he opened it up completely.  This was one of the last really raw sounds from Prince before he got locked into restrictive contracts and such.  Still, what a way to go.
B000N6UERK|5.0|Great action movie that really keeps your attention until the end.  Denzel Washington has an outstanding performance that again does not disappoint.  Worth the money to have on blu-ray if you ask me.
B000002L7R|4.0|This release is definitely one of his more obscure.  Clearly he was in a transitional phase in production and bands.  It made for some complex lyrics and a really layered, full sound.  Plus, you can't discount the artistry of sneaking a ton of sexual metaphors onto the airwaves that loads of the 80s never even realized.
0739313126|4.0|I listened to this book on a Playaway device that I checked out from my local library. I'm not going to do an in-depth review of the book's content, nor am I going to address its historical accuracy (or any of the other topics that have already been beaten to death). I would like, however, to present my personal opinion of the work as I experienced it.<br /><br />Majoring in law in college, I had to read for what seemed like 5 years straight. As a result, I prefer to listen to my 'leisure' books on CD and the like, as I did with this one. The audio was unabridged and 16 hours long. I enjoyed the story immensely, and feel the 16 hours were very well spent, though making my way through the 106 chapters sometimes felt like it was taking a very looooong time. Two things bugged me as I 'read'; the author used the word 'now' incessantly, to the point that it started grating on my nerves about 1/3 of the way through. \\"It was darker now\\", \\"It was quieter now\\", \\"They were getting closer now...\\" AAAAGH! The other was the reader's bad attempt at character's accents. He did French very well, but his British accents were a strange bastardization of English, Scotch, Irish and who knows what. Not a big deal, but glaring enough that you'd think the director/producer of the project would've noticed it.<br /><br />Admittedly, nothing in the story ever really surprised me, many of the twists I saw coming a mile away, but at the same time I didn't find the ending rushed or incomplete as some reviewers did. I read several reviews before I decided to post my own and have to shake my head at the huge number of verbose, negative critiques. Sometimes I think people enjoy hearing themselves type, so they make a much bigger issue out of things than is necessary. This book is a light, fun novel and I'm glad that I chose to listen to it.
B000002KY8|4.0|It would be easy to forget this CD as a whole, due to the fact that its title track became an anthem of a generation.  Taken in the context of the whole, though, \\"1999\\" is the one that put him not just on the map, but on several.  Prince had been well-known to R&B listeners, but this one took him mainstream in a whole new way.  He held nothing back in his lyrics or music, which managed to chronicle the fears and forays of a decade.
B000068IEU|3.0|take this movie for what it is. a slasher flick that gives you a lot of gore and very little plot. it can't be called a classic but it is not that bad.
B0000027RL|5.0|Everything about it rules.  Although it characterizes a profound period of my life, this release permanently changed the direction the music industry was going at that time.  It ended an era of boy bands and pop slop, introducing us to the more political scathingly personal sound of grunge.  I remember being eternally grateful for the a more organic sound, but at the end of it I don't really care what legend they created of themselves by, along with their peers, altering the industry.  The music speaks for itself.  Every song on it is win.
1582701709|5.0|I am not too great at reviews but would definitely buy this again.It has information other books of self help doesn't have.
B000002MT0|3.0|Considering that his career was being hijacked thru this phase of his development, this release reflects that struggle.  It comes across like a rebelling thirteen year old.  While I completely support his vigilante ethics on sexual expression, the music itself on this CD just did nothing for me.  Sad, that.
B000R9J3X4|5.0|OK folks...settle down...this is a compilation and yes some great songs were left off, but if you have all of their other CD's (my favorite is Beautiful Garbage) then you have nothing to bitch about! Considering that some videos were previously available only on a out-of-print VHS, this is a Godsend for Garbage fans. Quit quibbling, unite, and crank up \\"Special\\"!
B000002KMV|4.0|Prince, in his more rock element.  It was easy to listen to this one and see him rising as a huge force on the music scene.  His sexual allusions were considered risqu&eacute;, then he matured into full-on sonar pr0n.  Not a bad way to spend a decade.

B000002L9B|4.0|The intrigue of this soundtrack is that it shows Prince's range.  Due to the blandness of the film, I think this CD is often overlooked for its merit.  It widely swings from bare soulful depths (Sometimes it Snows...) to fun ensemble pieces (Christopher Tracy...) through the more established sound of Prince, between.  The music from this release did not get much attention, but in terms of observing Prince's development as an artist, you can't overlook where this phase of his sound led him in later productions.  It was a turnkey era in his career.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|\\"Barry was one of those born clever enough in gaining a fortune, but incapable of keeping one, for the qualities and energies which lead a man to achieve the first are often the very cause of his ruin in the latter case.\\"    This is the theme, spoken by an unseen narrator, which runs through at the very center of Stanley Kubrick's majestic historical epic \\"Barry Lyndon.\\" Following a string of three masterworks, which, conventional wisdom has dictated, represent the creative peak of Kubrick's legendary career as a filmmaker, it was Thackeray's novel about the rise and fall of a young Irish scoundrel who rises the ranks of 18th century English nobility that the enigmatic artist chose to set his sights. Conventional wisdom also tells us that, beginning with \\"Barry Lyndon\\" in 1975 and as further pronounced in 1980 with the release of his horror opus \\"The Shining,\\" Kubrick's work began to display a diminished artistic resonance. These films, the feeling goes, lacked the visionary, complex implications of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and the insightful social commentary of \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Kubrick must simply be losing his touch, right? Well, not really. Although it may apply to \\"The Shining\\" and Kubrick's subsequent works, the conventional wisdom, as applied to \\"Barry Lyndon,\\" is wrong. Or, should I say, it WAS wrong. That is, until time alone was able to be the final judge of the film's legacy. Fortunately, subsequent critical revisiting of the film led many to finally come around to appreciate \\"Barry Lyndon\\" and regard it as the rich and giant masterpiece that it is.     Kubrick himself was perhaps such a divisive and misunderstood artist due to his desire to tell stories against the grain of the usual approach. Unlike traditional film narratives, which most often focus on human relationships and manipulate our emotions through drama and conflict, Kubrick concerned himself on much larger themes. He was most often interested in man's relationship to his society, and explored themes of broader conflict. His dramas were not sentimentalized and narrowed by character conflicts alone, but always examined the implications of these characters and conflicts to the shaping of the course of society and humanity.    FILM ANALYSIS:    If for nothing else, Kubrick's film cannot be denied as a stunning example of visual achievement. Quite simply, it is one of the most sumptuous, haunting, majestic, and gorgeous cinematic experiences ever realized. Richard Schickel, the highly distinguished TIME magazine film critic, who did a cover story of the film prior to its general release, praised it as \\"perhaps the most ravishing set of images ever printed on a single strip of celluloid.\\" The landscapes are epic and breathtaking, the interiors rich and elegant, and each shot composed with a painter's eye for design and detail. It is no surprise that Kubrick found his visual inspiration in 18th century paintings and even went so far as to pose his actors just as subjects in certain paintings were positioned. Additionally, the costume and sets are impeccably designed (so much so that they garnered Oscar wins, as did the photography and the music), and Kubrick's use of classical music further heightens the sense of high art and elegance. All of these production elements, coupled with a cast of actors who are in tune with the material and who embody the director's keen sense of genuine human qualities, bring to screen life an era in history with an authenticity that is often attempted but rarely ever accomplished so vividly. It is not a dull and ancient past, but a living, breathing present that we are immersed in.     As with most of Kubrick's work, after going through this journey, it is not the triumph of speech or spirit that remains with us, not the wit and wisdom of dialogue nor the emotional connection between people. It is purely the magical, visceral impact of the visuals that remains in our mind, and Kubrick puts great care into making everything count. It is the slow zooms that reveal the larger context, the landscapes, sometimes liberating, often just as oppressive. It is the nuance of a facial expression, the gleem in the eye, the empty gaze, the way that light plays off people and objects. It is the quite moments that reveal so much more than any words could ever justify. It is the music that brings mood and texture to the many varying states of emotion.     Kubrick, as well, is not up to his usual bag of tricks here. In his previous film, \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" he utilized a great many devices (i.e. slow motion, fast motion, fantasy, expressionistic acting, outerwordly sound effects) to create a bizzare and nightmarish sense of reality. In this film, however, the cinematic trickery is downplayed, as is necassary for the more elegant feel of the material, and the ever confident master artist takes great care in the more \\"pure\\" and classical elements of film storytelling that take root in the silent era. Each scene, each shot even, is deliberately executed with precise and flawless use of composition, lighting, sound, editing, and staging. Notice, for example, how the tension of the final climactic duel is so carefully escalated by the use of sound (pigeons in the rafters), music (a subtle underscore), and editing (the careful cuts back and forth between two faces), or how various pieces of music pronounce the transitions in Barry's life throughout the film.     CHARACTER ANALYSIS:    Through the journey of Redmond Barry (played with brilliant subtlety and understated turmoil by Ryan O' Neal), Kubrick is able to communicate themes of moral decay, decadence, and duplicity that exist in the attainment of power and social privilege. As we follow Barry's life, from a naïve and idealistic young Irishman, with little money and no prospects, to his rise as the cruel and treacherous Lord of the Lyndon manor, and finally to a beaten and broken man, crushed under the weight of his own inadequacies, we come to understand the dimensions of a man who has the skill and ruthless ambition necessary to use circumstances to his advantage. Ultimately, however, Barry's rise to power and fortune place him in a world this beyond his means, by which his incompetence is displayed in his squandering of the Lyndon fortune and the destruction of his own reputation. In a single moment of explosive rage between stepfather and stepson, a family quarrel that plays itself out in front of horrified spectators of London's high society, Barry begins to feel that weight bear down on him. Kubrick communicates this with a zoom out as Barry stands alone on the grand balcony, a distant figure, weak and vulnerable, overwhelmed by his great castle and by great responsibilities.       It is interesting, though, that Kubrick places judgment not only on Barry, who is admittedly a dishonest rascal, but also upon the society in which his characters exist. \\"Gentlemen may talk of the age of chivalry,\\" says our omniscient narrator, speaking in a jovial British manner that only faintly masks the sarcastic brand of cynicism hiding just below the surface. Instantly, his point is clear to us. Humanity can be a cruel beast, in any age and under any circumstance, even a chivalrous one. What's more, Barry is a mere product of his age of \\"chivalry\\" and is not the only scoundrel who is able to cheat his way to the top of the social food chain. The classical scoring also adds an ironic contrast and counterpoint between the façade of nobility and the debauchery that many characters play a role in. Working with this theme, Kubrick, with a distinctive sense of characterization and human behavior, allows us to understand what makes a man (and perhaps mankind itself) proficient enough to acquire power, privilege, and political clout, often through immoral conduct, and how he comes to destroy these institutions and himself.     There is also the question of Barry's underlying motives. What is really behind this obsessive need to become a proper \\"gentleman,\\" a title which takes on an ambiguous context as we discover certain facts about the inner-workings of the nobility. One gets a sense that there exists a deep rooted inferiority complex with Barry's character. Perhaps due to his underprivileged upbringing, or even due to the envy of not having the distinction of British pedigree (suggested in his joining the British army), Barry seems driven by resentment, self-loathing, and the need for acceptance. There is not one clear conviction that defines his quest, only a need to be perceived as something that he is not: a proper gentleman and dignified member of the privileged class. Our narrator questions the role of fate in Barry's rise to such fortune, but Kubrick ultimately seems to leave doubt to the credence of such ideas. Ultimately, it seems that, even when luck is on our side, when the grand gamble goes our way as it were, and we find ourselves in the favor of fate, there is no guarantee that the natural drives of humanity (in Barry's case, a self-destructive ambition for wealth and status) will favor our ability to maintain our good fortune. Man, after all, by the very flaw of his character, has the ability to be the ruin of his own way of life. Perhaps it can be seen as a warning to the rise to power of those who are incapable of acting with morality and prudence. Perhaps not. As with all of Kubrick's work, it does not lend itself to easy answers, only to immensely rewarding viewing, reviewing, and discussing...
0143038419|4.0|Cleverly and entertainingly written. I didn't know what to expect under the 'strange' title. I was definitely pleasantly surprised, and recommend it to ladies from all ages.
B000A2BNSG|5.0|Actually, I heard and liked the movie soundtrack first before I watched the movie. I thought the song was quirky and funny, and then after watching the movie, I like them both.  I must say it was one of the weirdest but funniest movie I've ever seen.  Everyone was acting brilliantly especially Johnny Depp, Faye Dunaway and Lili Taylor.  Even though the ending was kind of strange and unfinished, it was a good ending to a totally wacky but \\"fishy\\" and dreamy movie. Not a typical Hollywood fare. Overall, I like it.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I watch this movie about once every two months.  The HD-DVD version is spectacular.  I watched the Firefly series on DVD after seeing this movie and loved it as well.  I can't believe I missed this when it was on TV.  It really is sad they cut this series.<br /><br />The future, the past, sci-fi, cowboys, six-shooters, samurai swords, space ships, zombie-like bad guys, a high-priced escort, and a sexually frustrated female mechanic.  That might sound crazy, but it works so well.<br /><br />Switching between English and Chinese is perfect and adds character to this great movie.  Cursing without cursing (like in Battlestar Galatica) is a nice touch.<br /><br />River is [...] in this film - too bad they didn't get this far in the series.  She's a true WMD - they should have found her in Iraq.<br /><br />The captain of Serenity has the perfect blend of toughness, honor, and heart.<br /><br />Don't miss this if you love Sc-Fi.  Watch the series first if you can, but either way you'll enjoy this over and over.<br /><br />UPDATE - the Blu-ray version is even better than the HD-DVD.  I also rewatched the entire Firefly collection on Blu-ray.
B00005MP58|4.0|This is the third version of the book a have seen so I know I'm probably tainted from the first two which I loved including mostly the casting of the characters.  Your first version of a character tends to be the one that becomes the benchmark in your mind. (I.e. Try to picture anyone else in these roles:  Brando in The Godfather, Hanks in Forest Gump, Gable and Leigh in Gone with the Wind, Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, etc)  The Kiera Knightley version is excellent and well cast.  Rosamond Pike as the eldest daughter and Keira Knightly (perhaps even too pretty if you know the book) were PERFECT in the version as was Matthew Macfayen as MR. Darcy and the rest of the cast.  The third sister Mary is not quite the \\"outcast\\" as in the two TV versions and is perhaps to nice looking but they didn't have time in the Motion Picture version to get into all the characters, like some of the faults the Mr. Bennet has, although I enjoyed Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett very much.  But for true fans of the book you may want more of the great story so I happened upon a BBC TV version which was much longer and therefore told the story more completely and it was also very well cast  (Except the even too already ridiculous Mr. Collins). The second version I saw delved more deeply into the characters and the story and the cast although not Ms. Pike and Ms. Knightly in looks were excellent and so was Mr. Darcy.  I actually liked the actresses who played Lady Catherine de Bourg and especially Mrs. Gardiner (who took her to Mr. Darcy's home) even better than the motion picture castings, but again having more time for the character helps.  Having said all this, although the 1996 version is the most extensive for fans of the story and IS well acted I just did not like the casting of Lizzy, Jane, and Mr. Darcy very much and the whole I did not enjoy it as much as the first two.  However if you have no preconceived ideas of the characters beyond the book you may like it more than I.  Asfar a production it did exceed the BBC version which almost felt like you were watching a true English live play especially in the indoor scenes shot with very few cameras.  (Which actually once you got used to it had it's charm as well).
0743496728|4.0|I wasn't sure I'd like the theme of this novel (high school killing rampage) but the rich characters and style/mood really drew me in.  So did the intrigue of \\"what really happened?\\" - In typical Picoult style, the ending leaves reader with an unexpected twist. (Why can't I find more authors that do this?!)<br /> I really liked how Jodi was able to encapture so many character's feelings and thoughts in alternating paragraphs, written in 3rd person, but seemed like first-hand account, like the characters were writing the story.  The story weaves back and forth in time surrounding the horrifying event.<br />The characters seemed authentic, not cheesy and contrived - She must've spent time consulting with real teenagers how they talk and their crazy adolescent feelings/insecurities.  Very reminiscent of when I was that age.<br />Not my favorite of hers, but definitely kept me satisfied, couldn't put it down!  I also rec. Picoult's Salem Falls, My Sister's Keeper, & Perfect Match.
7884772418|5.0|This is the BEST single CD Elvis collection available and probably should be the first CD purchased by new or curious fans. The sound quality is great and it includes all his really big hits, from Heartbreak Hotel through Don't Be Cruel through Crying in the Chapel to Burning Love. Every song on here hit number 1 either in the US or UK or both. Elvis had so many hits that became signature songs. This CD is a MUST! Highly recommended for all music fans!
B000QXDEDG|5.0|Fantastic. The fight scenes were awesome. If you buy only one movie this year, this should be it!!!  Total feast for the eyes and senses. Especially Gerard Butler.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is the best single CD Elvis greatest hits collection available. It includes Elvis' biggest hits from the US and UK. All the songs on this set hit number 1 in either the US or UK or both, including the remix of his classic \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" which went to number 1 in the UK (and stayed there for 4 weeks) and several other countries in 2002. This set spans almost his entire career from his first international hit in 1956, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", right on through the last single to be released before his death in 1977, \\"Way Down\\". In between you get classics like \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"All Shook Up\\", \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\", \\"In the Ghetto\\", \\"Suspicious Minds\\", and \\"Burning Love\\"! Just about every song is a classic. If you buy only one Elvis CD, this should be it. Highly recommended!
0060543981|5.0|Writen during the Great Depression, \\"Little House in the Big Woods\\" is Laura Ingalls Wilder's memoir of growing up in Wisconsin in the years  immediately following the Civil War.  The book chronicles a year in the life of Laura's family.  The writing is absolutely charming in its simplicity and I found myself caught up in the details of the family's material culture. I was reminded of Eric Sloane's \\"Diary of an Early American Boy\\", another classic of the genre.<br /><br />I think memoirs are better heard than read.  The narrator, Cherry Jones is a charasmatic performer whose voice twinkles with humor and warmth.  In addition, the recording also includes a violin accompaniment to Cherry Jones' singing of the many songs that appear in the story.  This is a beautiful recording and I give it my highest recommendation.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|With her raspy voice and smooth vocal delivery, I could listen to her sing the alphabet and I'd enjoy it!    This album of songs fits Norah's voice perfectly. As with most albums there are always a few standouts when you first play it. The ones that grabbed me right away were Sinkin' Soon and Small Room.    But it doesn't take many more listens to get to enjoy just about every song on the album!     If you're a Norah Jones fan, you'll enjoy this one.     I know I do.
B0000009SG|5.0|this is great stuff. from the same sessions as apostrophe - these two albums belong together. this is zappa at his darkest, most twisted, inspired period.<br /><br />It is Zappa's first jaunt into mainstream. No it is not the Jazz side, but neither was Freak Out. This was my introduction to FZ, it is raunchy, but I still find it hilarious and I love Frank's guitar.
0345494768|5.0|For all those you loved the first Star Wars experience this book is a must have. The hard copy has many extra pages and it worth the additional price. The pictures and details included makes this a fun, informative and exciting book to read and re-read.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I bought two of these mounts for 2 Dell 19\\" monitors I have at work.  Install was an absolute breeze. They come assembled and ready to istall. I simply took them out of the box, screwed the Grommets onto my desk, then screwed on the monitors.     They swing away easy and are pretty simple to adjust.  I do recommend keeping the monitors in a fixed location for the most part however, because I can see them starting to get a bit loose and not holding their position well with a lot of excessive adjustments.    Delivery was very fast as well. Showed up several days early. Overall, I highly recommend these mounts!

076075084X|1.0|This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.  I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed.

1400032717|5.0|Having two autistic relatives, I was very interested to read this book.  I found it to be a fascinating glimpse in to the mind of an autistic child.  His single mindedness and perception of things as either black or white, reminded me so much of my nephew.  A truly great book and interesting view of life in the mind of an autistic.  Besides that, it was a good story as well.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I missed most of The West Wing when it was originally on TV.  I liked those few bits and pieces I saw, but didn't appreciate that something far, far better than usual TV fare was being presented.  When I started renting the few DVDs that were available at my local video store my family and I viewed episodes that were as good as good as feature motion pictures - and even the weakest episodes are good.<br /><br />The problem was that the store had fewer than a third of all episodes.  So we bit the bullet and reluctantly put out about $180, I think, for the entire series - money, as it turns out, that was extremely well spent.<br /><br />The West Wing is arguably the greatest drama ever to appear on American television.  This is a series I'll keep forever, and hand down to my children.  It is entertaining, educational, and simply a delight to watch.  At a more abstract level, TV has so much junk that it is also heartwarming to be reminded of the potential value of the medium.  The West Wing is written, acted, and staged brilliantly.  I can't praise it highly enough.<br /><br />Forty-five DVDs - seven seasons - and about 130 episodes are neatly organized in a classy portfollio-like case.  I'd like to express my deepest appreciation to the show's creator, Aaron Sorkin, who is also responsible for the movie, \\"The American President,\\" and to everyone associated with the show.<br /><br />The price is a bargain.
B000UK73QO|5.0|I borrowed this at the library and recently bought a copy as this is the type of book that can't be read just once.    The first time I read A New Earth, I was floored at Eckhart's clarity and wisdom.  No one can fake what's written in this book...but then again I could be wrong!  What do I know?  But seriously, this book blew my mind to oblivion.  Even  those who are awake will find something in here to connect to.      I've read a few reviews that complain Eckhart doesn't have any new ideas.  While true, that isn't the point; he can explain the unexplainable in such a remarkably pithy way.   We need a conscious population...now more than ever.  In my opinion, we need more books by more enlightened beings, each with their own way of explaining the same experience.  The more people that can explain this information to the masses, the better chance we'll  have for a \\"New Earth.\\"      Echkard Tolle wrote the most clear and concise explanation of the ego I've seen to date.   And to write with such detail, he would have had to let go of his ego to see it as clearly as he has.  He  talks about the ego's function through childhood, parenthood,  addiction and other stimulii.    I'm a quote geek, so here are some of my personal favorites from the book...and this is just a fraction of them.        \\"Non-resistance, non-judgement and non-attachment are the three aspects of true enlightenment\\"     \\"Attachment to things drop away when you no longer seek to find yourself in them.\\"    \\"Even if you defeat your opponent, the unconsciousness will simply have moved into you, or the opponent reappears in a new disguise.\\"    \\"Whenever you feel superior or inferior to someone; that's the ego in you.'    \\"The more shared past there is in a relationship, the more present you need to be; otherwise, you will be forced to relive the past again and again.\\"    \\"If you can be absolutely comfortable with not knowing who you are, then what's left is who you are.\\"    \\"The more limited, the more narrowly egoic the view of yourself, the more you will focus and react to the egoic limitations of others.  Their \\"faults\\" or what you perceive as their faults become to you their identity.  This means you will see only the ego in them and thus strengthen the ego in yourself.  Instead of looking \\"through\\" the ego in others, you are looking \\"at\\" the ego.  Who is looking at the ego?  The ego in you.\\"
B000PMGS8G|1.0|The movie itself is pure fun. The video transfer is great. The audio is not so great. What happened to the bass? I though the woofers in my speakers were not working. The original vhs version of the movie sounds better.<br /><br />The extras are a joke. The cover art was not impressive. The packaging design seems to indicate that there are some cool stuff included the casing. There is one pencil sketch which to me looks very amatureistic...that's it.<br />Everything else about this \\"Saviour Of The Universe Edition\\" has been mentioned before so I'll stop right here.<br /><br />My copy is going into my \\"sell\\" drawer, while I wait for some company who has enough interest in the project to remaster it the RIGHT way.<br /><br />I'm very dissapointed.
B0000025KI|5.0|This is a great album, right the the opening snare shot on The Ties That Bind you are hooked. The E Street band rock in a way that few other bands do and they sound fantastic. The reason for this is the way Springsteen records his albums (or certainly did up to the mid 80's). He puts the chords in front of band and then they record it live in the studio, and thats what you get on the record. When you here Bruce shout 1,2,3,4 its not a fake its for real. For me the E Street band is almost the perfect backing band. Two Lead guitarists, Piano, Organ and of course the stand-out Tenor Sax playing of Clarence Clemons<br /><br />Some people have criticised the album, saying the songs are all about the same subject (i.e. either Girls or Cars or both) and there are quite a few like this. However interspersed are some brilliant heart-rending songs, such as The River, Independence Day and Point Blank. Frankly I wouldn't care if all the songs were about girls and cars anyway, because Springsteen and the E Street band perform on their studio albums in a way that most bands struggle to do when playing live. Listen to \\"Out In The Street\\"; lyrically its nothing to talk about, but the performance is what counts and its the same with the rest of this double album. Buy The River and you'll understand why Springsteen and the E Street band were the biggest live attraction on the Planet for so many years.
0143038419|4.0|The author certainly has a way with words!  She lets us know her dark thoughts,adventurous spirit, and light moments.  Her spiritual search is something we can experience through her journey as most of us won't sit with a guru or meditate patiently.  Some might view her journey as self-indulgent, but I think it is wonderful that she can care for herself enough to LIVE HER life.  Too many of us allow pressure to live a normal life (whatever that is) and yet she maintains her individuality and her sense of joy.  A great read!

1400049628|3.0|I was under the impression that this was intended as a humorous piece.  In fact, it is far less parody than it is science-fiction.  And not very good science fiction -- Brooks, in his attempt to explain the existence of Zombies frequently contradicts the reality that he creates.    Anyone with a fleeting interest in science fiction and the zombie sub-genre might find this interesting, but for my taste I'll stick with I AM LEGION.  Even the hilarious SHAUN OF THE DEAD has a greater respect for the \\"realities\\" of zombie-fiction than Brooks exhibits.
0062515675|5.0|Enormous amount of wisdom is covered here. I finished this thinking that this is one of the best books I've ever read on how to live in this world. I was shocked at the amount of principles covered in this story. I just wasn't expecting what I got from this.<br /><br />I initially refrained from underlining and marking up my book because I thought I might want to loan it out. So, I took notes. I've since decided that I'm gonna read it again and underline the great parts I want to revisit. Just when I thought this guy had covered most everything, he pulled out even more! This is an awesome book.<br /><br />Okay, the other nice thing about this is each chapter ends with an action summary. I liked how this wraps up each chapter. So, you get the chance to think about what happened in the story, the points being made, and the great thing is it gives you the techniques.<br /><br />I read a few reviews where people were criticizing the story. I thought the story was good, with a few weak spots. But the story isn't the main point, it was just the vehicle to deliver the goods.<br /><br />I loved this book! This is one that I think can definately make a difference in your life. The thing about books like this is, usually people read it once, decide that there is something to it and maybe even make a few changes in their life and a little while later they slide right back into living the way they always have. Reread it, absorb it, and make lasting changes.
0739350323|4.0|We listened to this interesting audiostory on a long car ride since it is 10 hours long.  It kept everyone captivated even the 8 year old and the teenagers.  If you like fantasy books that include magic like the Harry Potter series, I think you will like this story.  We were disappointed though when we learned that this is only the first book of a six book series and only the first book has been released.
B0001WE6U2|4.0|lost my original lens hood so i got this. the good thing is that it works on other lenses with 67mm filter threads, like the tamron 17-50 and 28-75. as far as lens hoods go, it's ok. it's pretty small, and it's not lined with felt of velvet like some lens hoods. it's petal-type, so there are cut-outs in its diameter, built of medium-strength plastic. the only reason to buy this is if you lose the one that came with your camera. you could go without it, but it does help to keep out flare in bright-light situations, and can be reversed for a trimmer fit in the bag.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|In most movies we see today, a director shows the movie's characters (whether proactively or reactively) moving the plot forward in such a way that the audience knows at least as much, (usually more,) about what's going on then the characters do.  The thing that makes this movie so fascinating (and to many people, frustrating) is that the characters start off knowing WAYY more about what's going on than you do, and you have to spend most of the movie trying to \\"catch up\\" by learning about who they are.     Moreover, the director has no plans to make it any easier for you to get to know these people than you would be able to if you met them in real life.  It becomes clear as you move through the movie that they are no more likely to expose the deep, dark secrets of their lives to you, the audience, than they would to strangers in a foreign country (even though this absurdity is what we, as the audience, have been conditioned by Hollywood to expect!)  As such, you cannot understand the story of this movie as merely a passive observer, waiting for an explanation to present itself.       So what's a movie watcher to do?  Well, this is the hard part: in order to get to know them, you have to pay close attention to what's NOT happening between the characters; what seems to be missing, or left unsaid?  Unless you invest in this exercise, you won't recognize the exquisite tension between the two protagonists as it builds to the movie's climax, and you will likely watch the credits feeling bored and maybe frustrated.  However, those who can engage with the impromptu couple emotionally will feel the intensity and depth of the director's vision.    I only give this movie four stars because the best movies seem to involve the audience in the plot effortlessly, without requiring so much mental energy.  However, director Sofia Coppola shows great skill in both crafting an environment through music and cinematography and populating it with characters that feel genuine and true tolife.

B000059T1V|3.0|Recorded and released in 1960, Live At Newport is one of the most beloved albums in the Muddy Waters catalogue, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest blues records of all time. To be honest, I'm not really sure why. Don't get me wrong: It is by no means a bad album. In fact, some of the performances found here rank among Muddy's very best: The legendary, show stopping rendition of \\"I've Got My Mojo Working\\" is a total barn-burner, with its fiery vocals, grinding pianos, and surging rhythms. \\"Tiger In Your Tank\\" raves with a similarly infectious abandon, and \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\" is tight and muscular.      Sadly, too much of this album is devoted to unspectacular, standard-issue blues. \\"I've Got My Brand On You\\" is an uninspired combination of generic songwriting and soulless instrumentation, while \\"I Feel So Good\\" doesn't deliver an ounce of the enthusiasm that its title promises. \\"Soon Forgotten\\" and \\"Goodbye Newport Blues\\" are slow burners that simply don't burn- the music is free of the tension that marks the best slow blues numbers. Perhaps the biggest dissapointment is \\"Hoochie Coochie Man.\\" In its studio incarnation, \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" is simply one of the greatest blues songs of all time. On this record, however, it's bland and unentertaining, devoid of the raw sexuality and smouldering passion that made the original such a classic.    So, there you go. An incredibly dissapointing album from a great performer.
1591841666|3.0|This book seems to me like it was taken from a lecture that Mr. Godin may have delivered.  Maybe he expanded on it a bit but I could picture someone reading this book out loud in front an audience.  It does state the obvious in some cases but makes you think of quitting in a new way - not as a defeat or something to be ashamed of, but as a potential choice in determining your life path.  It is a very quick read.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|I have just finished viewing the 2007 film Zodiac - directed by David Fincher - about the infamous serial killer.  What an excellent movie.  The acting in this movie was exceptional, especially Jake Gyllenhaal as cartoonist Robert Graysmith, Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi, and Robert Downey Jr. as crime reporter Paul Avery.  The movie also features a solid turn for Anthony [of ER fame] Edwards as Toschi's partner Inspector William Armstrong.  John Carroll Lynch [from the Drew Carey show, among many other films and shows] also does a fine job as one of the suspect's; the creepy Arthur Leigh Allen.<br /><br />The cinematography truly captures a late 60's through 70's San Francisco.  The visuals were very pleasing in this film.  There were several very chilling moments in the movie as well.  Admittedly, I had not read either of Graysmith's books.  I did; however, thumb through both at the bookstore, so I had some idea who the author ultimately believed was the killer.  The movie kept you guessing the entire time.  The music perfectly captured the uncomfortable sense of foreboding that went with several of the scenes.<br /><br />The theme of the movie is obviously obsession and how it overcomes people.  I don't think that is always bad, especially in a case like this where the end result will - hopefully - net the arrest of a dangerous criminal.  Gyllenhaal really was outstanding in the way his performance sold the obsession that Graysmith developed with the case.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in crime movies, true stories, and true mysteries.  First and foremost, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great films, great directing, and great acting.  I found Zodiac to be a thoroughly engrossing 5 star movie experience.  I was disappointed that there were not special features included with the DVD, as I would have enjoyed seeing/hearing from the real Graysmith.

B00002DEGZ|5.0|In what must be considered a triumph of performance and recording, the Bilson/Gardiner/English Baroque Soloists collaboration on the Mozart Piano Concertos cycle makes us understand anew what Mozart should really sound like. These are period instruments? We can't make ourselves believe that, and yet that is the case here, as remarkable as that may be. The sound that pours forth from these discs is rich, vibrant, full, and, powerful. Bilson doesn't miss a beat, and Gardiner and the English Baroque Soloists play throughout with their usual silky perfection. The recording quality is simply superb, and the balance between piano and orchestra is just right. And although the piano is the focus of this set of works, the English Baroque Soloists play with such great precision and rich sound that we appreciate all over again the important role in orchestral accompaniment in successfully pulling off compositions like these. This is certainly a set that most, if not all, classical musical enthusiasts should consider acquiring.<br /><br />These discs, as virtually all of the Archiv/DG discs from the 1980's and 90's, were originally released as individual pieces. At that time, these discs were being sold at a much greater price, and collecting the entire set was a more difficult task. With DG's more recent \\"Collector's Edition\\" box sets, which consist of entire sets of re-issued recordings in a more economical packaging, acquiring these sets is now simultaneously much easier and less expensive. (In fact, building a comprehensive classical collection today using such box sets is now much more a feasible undertaking, and although we lose out on all the lovely artwork that once graced the individual Archiv discs, it is a small price to pay for making these recordings much more affordable and pre-organized into comprehensive collections.)<br /><br />Mozart's Piano Concertos, a form he essentially created, are some of the most delightful, cheery, and upbeat pieces in the repertoire, and even non-classical enthusiasts have difficulty avoiding their obvious delights. Nevertheless, even Mozart said that there were gems hidden among them that only the most musically talented individuals would be able to discern, and so these pieces hold something for everyone. Among the numerous recordings available, this set is certainly one of the very best, making it a prime choice for the collector. Take advantage of DG's \\"Collector's Edition\\" set to make it an even better deal.and even non-classical enthusiasts have difficulty avoiding their obvious delights.

B000QCUB8I|4.0|I heard this CD while browsing through an indie CD store.  The distinctive distortion had me asking the clerk if it was the new Daft Punk CD.  In response he handed me \\"Cross\\" by Justice.  Seeing the giant cross on front of the CD, and track titles like \\"Genesis\\" and \\"Waters of Nazareth\\" made me think it was some sort of Christian Rock, so I put it back on the rack (nothing against Christians, it's just that Christian Rock isn't my thing).  Over the next 20 minutes while hunting through the bins, I was able to give Justice a good listen.  It sounded so good that ended up grabbing the CD on the way to the counter.    This is one of the best electro-dance CD's that I've heard in a long time.  Some other reviews written here disagree, but this does remind me of some of my favorite mid-to-late 90's albums like \\"Exit Planet Dust\\", \\"Dead Cities\\", and \\"Homework\\".  Justice's \\"Cross\\" album is not on the same level as those masterpieces; but in the current desert of good electronic music in the late 00's, it is certainly is a breath of fresh air.    The music flows from track to track in a very smooth manner.  There are great beats and they use noise and distortion in a blissful way.  Some of the songs slow down a little too much for a good dance flow, but those songs make it a great CD to have on while relaxing at home or for listening to in the car.    There is one drawback.  I hate the track \\"Tthhee Ppaarrttyy\\".  It is the latest rip-off of \\"Supersonic\\" by J. J. Fad (\\"Fergalicious\\", \\"Wind It Up\\", etc.).  Whether or not his track is tongue-in-cheek, I can't tell.  Still, that's what my FF button is for.    That aside, this is a great album with some clever samples.  I think my favorite is their sample off the odd Booji Boy intro \\"We're All Devo\\" by DEVO on the track \\"Stress\\".  It's a very strange (and obscure) sample to use, but they really make it work.  It was a nice moment that added a cherry to the top of this very enjoyable album - especially as a DEVO fan.  Pick thisup if you want to hear one of the best and most listenable dance albums to come out in a long time.
B000M4RG42|2.0|Had high hopes for the movie after reading the book and since Eastwood was the director  Alas, the jerky editing, the simplistic messages hammered home in every frame of the movie marred what could have been an all-time classic.  Even the war scenes, impressively framed, do not shed light on what was really going on - instead go for gore and shock.  Eastwood should have spent more time on the war and less on the bond tour.  He could have also done away with the flashbacks and used a simple linear narrative: training camp, war, bond tour and end on a high note.

0618680004|2.0|I am an agnostic who was looking for some profound reading when I purchased this title.  Instead, what I found was a radical's attempt at pigeonholing the entire world into an nice little set of eggshells while not confronting the real issues at hand.    It is obvious that Dawkins is biased by his own superiority complex.  I was expecting so much more.  At least Christopher Hitches is able to distance himself from his emotion.  Dawkins is not capable of doing that.    In reading this title, I have found that the most essential arguments are the ones taht Dawkins misses.  Where is Karl Marx in this text?  He is mentioned once.  What about the false analogy behind Russel's Teapot?  Dawkins makes a statement without backing it up.  What about the ascertation that the dogmatic way in which he approaches atheism is so similar to the ways in which theists throughout history have approached theism?  He again, denies such without backing it up.    Instead, Dawkins spends 300 pages shedding a light upon subjects that most people who would pick this book up have already thoroughly explored.  All the while, he proves himself to be a hipocrate by using these 300 pages to tout a belief system that he doesn't even profess to accept.    I'm sorry, but anyone who is interested in pursuing the topic of anti-thesim could easily spend their money elsewhere.  Richard Dawkins is no atheist.  He is a poser who has tried to hijack the word for his own devices just like the theists he is attempting to denounce.  He does a pretty good job denouncing these theists.  He does a horribly poor job at defending himself.
B00005JPQR|3.0|It seems that while this movie was being filmed someone on the set used their video camera to make a home movie. Then, in the edit room, somehow, the unofficial version was substituted for the real thing. The result is that it looks like someone with Parkinsons or Essential Tremmor,  without any stabilizing equipment, took the picture. This is fine for some action scenes, but is quite nauseating when the whole movie is like this. It's like reading a book written with poor grammar -- one concentrates on the words instead of the story. It detracts from the story line when one is concentrating on trying to get past the poor filming technique. For example, What's the point of showing written text on the screen if it can't be read because the camera is shaking so much? It may be less distracting on the small screen. A basic principle for all producers of goods and services is to test their product by becoming a consumer. I find it hard to believe that those who made this movie saw what they made and liked it.  Now, if the film gets an Oscar for photography, I'll know that Hollywood has lost all touch with reality. Meanwhile I'll live in hope that they find the professional version, which would make a pretty good movie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I used to be a Conservative Republican. I voted for George Bush in 2000. I used to think Michael Moore was a big fat, disgustiung ogre who had a chip on his shoulder against President Bush.  Watching him up there on the stage at the Oscars giving his acceptance speech in 2003 enraged me at the time. But one year after the Iraq war, things started coming unraveled that would change my faith in the GOP and give this movie an honest look.<br /><br />More and more, I started hearing about bad intelligence.  One was the fact that Iraq had \\"NO\\" weapons of mass destruction, as alleged by the Bush Administration.  Intelligence made up by the CIA had us believing Hussein was manufacturing Uranium in the African country of Niger.  That intelligence was rebuked by PBS's Frontline story, \\"The Dark Side\\" and lead to the outing of CIA agent, Valerie Plame by Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, L. \\"Scooter\\" Libby.  Another was the fact that the Patriot Act was \\"NEVER\\" scrutinized when it was passed.  This was information I already knew prior to watching this film.  Democrats never stood up and questioned the blatant violation of the First Ammendment for fear of being, \\"Unpatriotic\\".  But what put me over the edge was the fact that Saddam Hussein was made a scapegoat to coverup the Bin-Laden/Bush linkage.<br /><br />I sincerely wonder if the Administration knew about 9/11 and did nothing to stop it.  There are so many questions that Michael Moore asked in this film that were never asked by the mainstream press (FOX, CNN,NBC, ABC, CBS). That leads me to believe that either Americans are dumb or just plain stupid for not questioning anything.  Judging from the results of the 2004 election, Americans have only themselves to blame for this debacle for not getting rid of the problem.  Me included!<br /><br />Whatever your feelings on Michael Moore, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.  Take the name \\"Moore\\" out of the mix and imagine it was made by someone else.  At least get both sides of the story and make a honest judgement on President George W. Bush and his decisions.the story and make a honest judgement on President George W. Bush and his decisions.

B0000027EP|5.0|Motorhead doesn't make \\"bad\\" albums. They make high quality, high energy, pure power, rock & roll. Of course even in a discography of masterpieces some are going to be better than others. Mark this one as better than most. 1916 is the best of Motorhead's Wurzel era, which featured the twin guitar line up with Phil Campbell. The songs here are all pretty catchy, and yes this really did deserve a Grammy even if Motorhead doesn't seem like it would be \\"Academy Award winning\\" music. If you have most of the classic Fast Eddie Motorhead CDs and are looking to expand your collection, put 1916 high on your list. Standout tracks: One to Sing the Blues, I'm So Bad, Voices in the Sky, Going to Brazil, RAMONES, 1916.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|In SPIDER-MAN 3, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally finding a balance to his life after having gained his spider-like powers a few years ago. His superhero alter-ego Spider-Man is beloved by New York. He is thinking about proposing to longtime girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He's also finally learned how to juggle all of his responsibilities between school, work, personal life, and night time crime fighting. Things seem to be going well.<br /><br />That is until Harry Osborn (James Franco) shows up as the New Goblin and tries to kill Peter. Their skirmish ends in a stalemate, but threatens their fragile friendship. Not long after that the police inform Peter and his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) that they have tracked down the second man who was involved in the murder of Uncle Ben. The suspect is one Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who during a late night chase falls into a genetic experiment involving sand and mutates into a sand monster. He starts stealing money to provide for his daughter, but is stopped by Spidey. That doesn't sit well with the Sandman and he promises to make things rough for Spider-Man. Things become even more confusing when extraterrestrial goo attaches itself to the Spider suit and turns it black. It gives Peter stronger powers, but also feeds on the darkness of his heart and threatens to overtake and control him.<br /><br />That's a lot going on in one person's life, but that's not all. Mary Jane is dumped on by the press and fired from her first big acting gig. Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a classmate of Peter's, is also making advances and proves a rival for Mary Jane. Meanwhile, Peter finds himself in a professional photography rivalry with Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). My, my what a tangled web we weave when we first chose Spider-Man to be.<br /><br />Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't a bad film. It's chock full of action, has a lot of character development, a healthy dose of humor, decent acting, and great special effects. In fact, the movie has a lot going for it.<br /><br />Yet, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't as exciting as it should be. There's just too much going on. For instance, usually one major villain in a film is enough. Sometimes you can get by with two, but even then a great deal of character development is lost. SPIDER-MAN 3 has three major villains who all want Spidey out of the way for different reasons. SPIDER-MAN 3 also strays more from the original comics than the first two films did. Turning a comic book into a major motion picture is never easy and Sam Raimi and company did an excellent job at tying everything together. However, in order to get all three villains in and make it all seem semi-plausible, the film strays more than would have been necessary otherwise. Being a live action comic book film, these things aren't as big a deal if SPIDER-MAN 3 was say, based on a novel. However, they are still there and drag the film down some. Therefore, though SPIDER-MAN 3 is a decent comic book action movie that makes a great end piece for this trilogy, the number of elements involved bog the story and pacing down and keep it from being equal to its predecessors.In fact, the movie has a lot going for it.<br /><br />Yet, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't as exciting as it should be.

1400063515|5.0|Do you agree that being hit with a tsunami has a totally different effect from a normal high tide?  If so, you'll be glad that Professor Taleb has decided to point out that all tsunamis (low probability, high impact events) need special attention, even if they occur infrequently.  His advice:  Minimize exposure to large potentially harmful events while taking maximum exposure to large potentially helpful events.<br /><br />I was particularly thrilled to see that Professor Taleb points out the foolishness of economists in preparing theories without checking the data to see if the theories work in practice . . . the greater foolishness of the Nobel committee granting prizes for such work . . . and the greatest foolishness of relying on the advice of such economists.<br /><br />Why all the fuss?  Many phenomena display high predictability and the differences from the average usually don't make all that much difference to you and me (that quality is captured by a statistical display called a bell curve where most cases cluster near the average and vary symmetrically from the average).  But in some cases, there are rare events that change the reality so strongly (like a tsunami can do on the negative side or a selection as an Oprah book of the month can do on the positive side) that it would be the height of foolishness to ignore the possibilities.<br /><br />When it comes to assets, wealth, book sales, athlete pay, and lots of other places where there is lots of competition, there are geometric rewards for a few while the mass do poorly.  These are long-tail events (the way statisticians talk about lots of variation from the norm).  But almost all human decision making assumes that there is little variation from the norm.<br /><br />The book concentrates on helping you understand why such a potentially harmful bias exists (brain structure plays a large role).  We also assume a continuance of what's in front of us, even when there's obvious evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />I was pleased to see these descriptions.  I constantly run into the same problem with executives who are subject to stalled thinking and don't see opportunities right under their noses to accomplish 20 times as much.  I liked Professor Taleb's points about overcoming our ignorance of antiknowledge . . . our tendency to discount what we haven't experienced or measured.  I frequently see executives estimate that the best anyone will ever do at a level that someone already exceeded in 1880.  In fact, in many important areas such as herbal health remedies, our actual knowledge is receding very rapidly, turning into antiknowledge.<br /><br />To help break you free of how you think now, he uses a metaphor (a black swan -- is that really a swan?) and new terms (Mediocristan -- where the bell curve is the right way to think about things and Extremistan -- where powerful in effect black swans lurk).  I found this tendency to be both helpful and not.  It made it clearer to me what he was talking about the first time, and then made things seem muddier after that.<br /><br />I suspect that for most people, the metaphor itself will be the biggest problem.  Do you really care about black swans, per se?  I don't.  I think Professor Taleb would have done better to use two metaphors (one positive -- perhaps like formation and attraction of wealth to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and the foundation's effects on world health, and the other negative -- perhaps like a tsunami) than to focus on one that is mostly about definitions (black swan).<br /><br />If you agree with Professor Taleb's main points, you will probably want to get lots of advice about how to do so.  He's specific only in regard to two areas (wealth management and book publishing opportunities).  That's a shame.  Perhaps he will write a future book that will go more into solutions.<br /><br />I was surprised to see that the book pretty much ignores the scenario work that many organizations use to identifythe large impact, unlikely occurrence events and to devise strategies that work better under all possibilities.  If that subject interests you, I suggest that you read books like The Art of the Long View and Inevitable Surprises by Peter Schwartz, Scenarios by Kees van der Heijdan, and The Irresistible Growth Enterprise by Carol Coles and me.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that Professor Taleb also feels that many black swans can become \\"grey swans\\" by employing new prediction methods (although we cannot predict specifics, we can often predict up or down reasonably well in some situations).  That has been my experience is seeing that Modern Portfolio Theory makes no sense in unsettled market conditions while more refined methods built stock-by-stock can be quite predictive over the short run in identifying over and under performers, even during unsettled market periods.<br /><br />Check your models before you use them each day.

Those who like films with ecology messages.  It is not a ray gun, ships blowing up film. No strange worlds or aliens.  Just humans and three robots. Many would find it boring today.  The effects are great.      The acting is B rated.  Story could have used a little more development.  The characters were a bit one dimensional.  I would have like to seen more development between the characters.  As it was you understood the main characters reasons, but it was hard to feel for him.    The robots were very unique in design.  The forest domes appear too small, to limited by what should have been there.  By today's standards, the technology and ship look dated.  But then when it was made it was quite forward thinking.    I would say a great rental movie.  Unless you like to collect old sci fi movies.

B000NA28I4|3.0|I recently watched this film on DVD.  I haven't read the book - so my opinions are based entirely on the movie version.    I couldn't believe the savage and pretentious reviews of this movie.  The book was written by a teenager.  How can ANYONE expect the depth, plot and complexity of Lord of the Rings!?!?!?!  Even the book was panned by the critics!    The photography and special effects are well above average.  The dragon is one of the best (possibly THE best) I've ever seen on film.  I loved the scene where she flew into battle wearing silver armor.  She was gorgeous and beautifully photographed.  In one scene - she is filmed in profile and shadow to look like a swan.    Bitchy critics and pseudo-critics panned this movie left and right and compared it to everything from Star Wars to Lord of the Rings. This is unfair and says more about the critics than it does about the film.    This movie is a well produced matinee movie with excellent special effects and decent acting.  For anyone who is a fan of the genre - I recommend it.
B000063V8S|3.0|I disagree with the previous reviews attesting to the greatness of season 4.  To the contrary, I find season 4 a mixed bag. About half the episodes are good with convincing story lines.  The other half are largely stupid, corny and outlandish stories with poor scripts that should have been rejected for better ones.  You almost get the feeling that some of these scripts were written by teenagers.  This same scenario plagues the entire NG series.  I remember when NG originally aired back in 88-94.  I often found myself turning the channel to something else - except when a good episode was on. This could've and should've been better.

Can You Keep a Secret? was a fabulous diversion from her shopaholic series character where I always find myself slightly annoyed at the protagonist for her decisions, this time around the main character is easier to like. She spills all her secrets to unbeknownst to her, her future boss, thinking they were all crashing to their deaths in a plane. They live and she learns he is her boss and she regrets telling her secrets. But we all can see that he is a good secret keeper. The book is a light and funny read as he teases her a bit without the knowledge of those around them and she is terribly embarrassed about telling him that when her friend comes over saying that they are going to fax some papers they are really in fact going to do nothing. And he just smirks when this situations arises in front of him. You all can predict the end as these books al tend to be predictable. Anyone who reads these types of books will delight in this romp.
0345494997|3.0|Judging by all the hype and instant best seller status many readers like me picked this up because of their interest in Wright.  Although fiction, I was hoping for more insight into the man but the novel is disappointing in this respect.  Well written but over the top in parts, it focuses on Wright's scandalous affair that ruined his first marriage.  Readers interested in getting a richer picture of Wright should try a recent account of his later exploits -- The Fellowship: The Untold Story of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Fellowship by Friedlander and Zellman.  Although non fiction, \\"The Fellowship\\" is in many ways more fun to read and paints a more vivid picture of the man and his followers.

B00005R2IS|5.0|when i bought mad max(eu edition) it had no extras the sound was 1.0 dolby that was it but complete original soundtrack, then in the US a version was brought out with Aussi sound 5.1 and a documentary so i bought this one aswell, when viewing the movie i soon found out that the soundtrack is not complete, for instance in the opening chase going after the nightrider the guy in the interceptor eventualy says ï'm gona ram him he repeats this many times, í only heard it twice in the US edition, but still the US editon comes with many more extras
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Going to see Grindhouse was an exercise in patience, and it's a huge relief that I don't have to sit through the mean-spirited, perverted, bloated lump of self-aware splatterfest that was Planet Terror in order to watch one of Tarantino's finest moments. This film is a work of love, more so than the rest of Tarantino's admittedly fabulous projects. The opening scenes reproduce the comfort of a crappy bar and rainy night better than any film I can remember. Huzzah Weinsteins, get the wheat out of all that deplorable chaff!
0740748475|5.0|It has been too long since they took Calvin & Hobbes off our local newspaper and as I read the book I recall some of the old adventures that just put me in stitches. I now have a new grandson and his name is Calvin and I picture him some day being just like Calvin in the comics. Some how Mr. Watterson was able to put so many real life issues into a media that can communicate humor to the masses and for this I say a BIG Thank You. Even if you don't have a grandson names Calvin, you will be able to place your own son/grandson into your own thoughts as he and Hobbes get into trouble.
B00005JPQR|5.0|I have only seen the movie once, so I will have to watch it again on DVD when it comes out to decide if it is the best in the series.  It is better than the first 2 movies in some ways, and worse in others.  If you haven't seen [[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0002ZDVEU The Bourne Supremacy (Widescreen Edition)]], then make sure to watch those first.<br /><br />The government is back after Bourne and are once again sending their best agents to take him down.  Joan Allen wants to help Bourne, but there is no way her superior would allow that.  The story isn't nearly as original as the first 2 movies, but it is a good continuation.  I don't really want to give anything away, but I will say that it is very intense and has probably the best spy sequence ever filmed where Bourne is trying to help out a reporter that the government wants to kill.  The action is also great.  The fight scenes are the best in the series, and of course there is also a car chase.  One problem I had is that the story doesn't flow together very well at times, but it still manages to remain intense throughout the entire movie.  The other problem I had is that Bourne has a bomb blown up right by him, he gets in a horrible car wreck, jumps out of buildings, it just goes on and on.  I think by the end of the movie he was limping, but it just isn't believable.<br /><br />If this is the end of the series, I am fine with that.  It is a good ending.<br /><br />4.5/5
0316067598|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" reminded me of \\"Night.\\"  You read it knowing the outcome, knowing that it's going to be a tough, emotional book and knowing that it is all based on true events.  Not very many books make me cry but this one definately did.    I did think there were some very interesting points about military life.  As a non-military person I could never understand some of the things that I had heard about training.  Marcus does a fantastic job of explaining them and the purpose behind them.    I also thought it was interesting how Marcus' view of people in Afganistan changed during his ordeal.  He definately had a \\"shoot them all\\" attitude at first and then some of them saved his life.  That makes the very valid point that there good and bad people in every culture.  I think it also brings up the point about how very different our culture is than theirs and how little we understand it.  That village made the decision to protect him to the last person.  How many towns in the US would have made that decision?
B000I5YCCO|5.0|An excellent CD.  What a great voice she has.  Craving more from this artist.
0316018953|4.0|The Overlook is vintage Connelly/Bosch.  A little shorter than the other books since this was actually a serial for a magazine.  None the less it was a very good if quick read.  I didn't mind that it was shorter as that allowed for a little less Bosch introspection and the story was not as dark as most Bosch tales.

B000E97HIA|3.0|I collect Prince's albums as I believe he is one of the most talented musicians on the planet. However, this one (while, yes, interesting) is probably not his best achievement, compared, say, to any of his albums from the 90's. Planet Earth seems to be a better and more solidly mastered album that he just released, summer 2007. Once I got both in my hands and realized that he can still right coherent melodies, I decided that this album only deserves 3 stars. He is great though, no matter what I or anybody else says!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie is amazing. My friends turned me onto it one night and I came home and ordered it immediately. The acting is phenomenal and the music is beautiful. And ladies, the leading man is gorgeous. I mean, absolutely beautiful.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Kelly Clarkson fought to have her own way on this album and you can tell.  The songs are all very personal.  A lot of them have to do with a bad breakup and the aftermath of that.  I'm sure the public would like to have heard more of the perky pop American Idol that they are used to, but her style is her own and I am a fan.    Hopefully next time around, she will be in a better place in her life and things won't seem as dark as they do in this album.
0792163710|5.0|A true classic; everything works perfectly. An outstanding script & direction that gradually builds to the inevitable & gripping climax, magnificent scenery & cinematography, top-notch performances by all the actors and a stirring soundtrack. I read the book 1st & in it Shane is himself very much like the Jack Palance character but he makes a conscious effort to turn his life around & change his ways forever. Alan Ladd portrayed him as a good-guy gunfighter with Roy Rogers buckskins & pearl-handled, nickel-plated pistol. But Ladd played the hell out of this role so it must be admitted that this was a change for the better. He played Shane as a noble, wise & world-weary knight-errant & this turned out to be an excellent choice for the movie version of the character. As noted above, all the performances are right on the money. My personal favorites are Jack Palance and Ben Johnson & even the ranchers are given redeeming qualities so everything is not so clearly defined as it might appear at 1st. Don't forget that this film has the villain that's never been topped - before or since. Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear was as good but nobody has ever been better than Jack Palance, & his part in Shane is him at his scary best. The story itself is very simple but there are many underlying subtleties that enrich every scene. The attraction between Shane and Marion, Joey's hero-worship of Shane & Shane's desire to pass on the best qualities of his experience coupled with  his  aversion to inspiring the boy into following his example. These are just a couple instances - watch the movie from start to finish & you'll appreciate all the ingredients that went into this wonderful film. I fall for all the sentimentality each & every time I watch it. One of the best movie endings of all time - a true tear-jerker when a wounded Shane rides off into the mountains to die all alone while the boy calls after him to come back. Any western fan needs this in their film library - it will stand up to repeated viewings, believe me.
074356619X|5.0|I do not take the time to read much, that is why I bought the audio book.  I listen to them while driving and when doing things around the house.    The context is inspiring and well done.  I also enjoy hearing testimonials from well known professionals.      I bought 4 and gave them to my adult kids and family members.  My grandson is 13 and he is already excited about some positive changes he can make in his life now.
B000R34V50|5.0|I have been a turtles since I was in elementary school so it was good seeing them come back to the new and old generation of fans. The movie is really good, it does not have a really deep story line since its not trying to be an oscar contender. Whats its trying to be is a fun action movie for the whole family to enjoy, and it delivers.
0812974611|4.0|After completing the book, I was inspired to learn even more about Pompeii even though I've visited there! There's a plethora of fabulous books at Amazon. Wish I'd read this one before I went. I am really thrilled to know that Roman Polanski is now making the movie version of it.     The aqueduct system detail-upon-detail was of less interest to me, and I found myself skimming through some of it, but with the inspiration to read more on life in Pompeii, this book is close to the top of my reading list this year.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble is simply amazing. I will continue to buy every single CD he releases. Buy this if you like big band, laid-back, romantic style and singers with smooth, classic voices. I try to convert everyone I meet into a Buble fan.
1401302378|5.0|This book gives a good history of how markets were established and changed over the course of time. Internet based businesses are changing our society from less of a hit culture to a niche culture. This book goes into how different markets can utilize the web to sell alot of one at a time sales rather than alot of one item. Products that work best are software/bit type of products rather than products that have actual mass.  A must read for anyone in the marketing or internet industry, or just business in general.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|This was an excellent movie. I have not seen an action movie like this since the 70s, 80s and early 90s.The picture is outstanding, sometimes it looks as though you are looking at a poster instead of a television.

0679847367|5.0|my girlfriends all time favorite book and now she has it a deluxe edition that came in great condition
039472903X|3.0|This book is dated as it was written before the web existed, but overall the concepts expressed are still applicable. As a graphic designer I think it is important to keep in mind what actually moves product over what is creative or artistic. This book expands on that concept in detail. Warning though, the materials are around the 1970's advertising time frame.
B00005B4GU|1.0|I was a big fan of Radiohead until Kid A, which I completely regretted purchasing. Nevertheless, I was hoping the band would \\"win me back\\" with Amnesiac. I was disgusted to find that Amnesiac was even worse. I refused to purchase the album and I subsequently abandoned the band.   Well, 6 years later, after numerous overtures, a roommate convinced me to revisit Amnesiac, arguing that I had not given the album a chance in 2001.   Well, after probably 7 listens, I have an even lower opinion of this album. Now, I consider myself a fairly open-minded and liberal music listener (i.e. I've got 75 music genres on my Ipod!). But this is hardly music. And just because it's \\"different\\" doesn't make it good. Worst yet, the lyrics, when one can actually hear them, are bland and nonsensical. There really isn't anything on Amnesiac that the average high schooler messing around on a laptop couldn't come up with.       Lastly, there is nothing on this album that hadn't been done much better before this album and Kid A were released (i.e. Brian Eno). There is NOTHING original here, despite all the praise Amnesiac recieves for \\"innovation.\\"   Avoid this disaster of an album at all cost.
B000JBWWQ0|2.0|For those who are interested in the Celestine Prophecy, I recommend reading the book first. The movie viewer may be a little confused by the storyline without any previous knowledge of the book. Although the movie delivers the main ideas of the Prophecy, a lot of important philosophy has been left out. In general it is a fun movie experience. Anyone interested in the laws of attraction, energy, or spirituality will relate to this movie.
B000OLGCHA|3.0|Not as good as previous 4 CDs.  The tracks were out of sequence with the scenes from the movie.

B000K7UBTI|2.0|As a once die hard Marvel comic book fan, who still owns hundreds of mint condition X-men, Spider man, Punishers and various other titles. Let me say that these past recent years, I've been utterly disgusted with the heads currently in charge at Marvel. Much like the crappy Spider Man 3, Iron Man is yet another assembly line mediocre attempt by marvel to cash in off die hard fans nastalgia.<br />I wont go into detail concerning the plot of Iron Man, simply because its predictable, unbelievable, and just crappy all across the board.<br /><br />As a kid, I hated D.C. comics, for reasons only die hard marvel fans can understand. Those cardboard cutout plots, the cape's, and generic goodguy badguy lines in the sand. While marvel represented a rebelousness, gen X, characters who were neither good nore bad, but existed in shadowy shades of gray. Yet thats how I felt as a kid.<br />Today, I cant pull myself away from the brilliance that is the Justice League cartoon series, Batman cartoons, and other D.C. projects. Simply because they go above and beyond creativity, allowing the artist to stay true to the characters while boldy pushing boundries. Iron Man, much like Spidey 3, the Fantastic Four movies, Dare Devil, the Punisher movie, Avengers cartoons, and other weak attempts by marvel to cash in, should be avoided at all cost people.
B000000OR9|4.0|Blue Murder didn't last long and their only real claim to fame as this group were the songs jelly roll and valley of the kings, yet they were far better than most of the \\" hair bands \\" of the 80's and early 90's.     One reviewer claimed anyone over two digets in their age were apparently in his mind a moron for liking this cd. Well, I must say I find that kind of thinking to be narrow minded and offensive. Just because he didn't like this cd doesn't make it bad.     I found it to be refreshing on many levels and while i wasn't enamoured of all the tracks, most were quite well done and easy to listed to. Valley of the Kings being my favorite.      Before rejecting this cd outright, why not give some of the tracks a listen then decide if it's worth it.
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is magic, pure and simple.  Although the greater, more commercially successful releases from the band during the 1970s are more popular, concluding with \\"The Wall\\", Meddle is still a treat unto it's own.  A splendid mix of psychedelic, progressive rock, blues and folk all intertwine to create a dreamy and sometimes dark album that rips through several moods.  A launching pad for future stardom, Meddle is one of the most underrated works by the band and should not go unnoticed.
0316067598|5.0|One of the most inspirational books I have read for a long time, along with being a source of flustration regarding the liberal press and liberals in Congress not allowing our soldiers to \\"fight\\" this war properly and the trial lawyer, who all need to be put out of business.  Clearly shows these groups are not in favor of the USA winning this war.
B000SSV8HI|5.0|Biggest Bang is essential viewing as a document of the Rolling Stones 2005/2006 world tour.  It is a 4 x DVD set, filmed in Texas, South America (Brazil & Argentina) & Far East (Japan & China), I think BEFORE the coconut tree!  Speaking of which, Keith Richards is such a character & raconteur, that in one segue in the Far East section of the DVD, Keith says of Shanghai \\"I hear they have a Chinatown there!\\"  Boom. Boom.    There are plenty of extras/bonus features on each DVD.  For instance, DVD 1 has sound-check or rehearsal footage of the Stones playing Muddy Waters' I Can't be Satisfied with Mick Jagger playing along on slide guitar!    DVD 4 in the set is given over to a documentary of the whole tour including the Superbowl.    I think the centrepiece of this DVD set is probably the free Brazil concert on Rio's Copacabana beach.  It's an amazing scene & atmosphere. The Stones seemed genuinely excited about this concert and it was reflected in their performance.  It was captured well on film and you can almost feel the heat of that Rio night.      Biggest Bang has songs featured from their most recent CD release Bigger Bang, as would be expected.  But Biggest Bang is overwhelmingly more versions of the same old songs.  Take that as a given, that's what the Stones do;  and I'm glad they still do.  But there are still some interesting song variations to their set.  The highlight for me, was the inclusion of Sway from (from Sticky Fingers).  I have never heard or seen that song performed live before.  It was from their greatest era and whilst I have never thought Ronnie Wood (God love him!) was at the level of the great Mick Taylor on guitar, Ronnie does a very good job on Sway.  In fact I think Ronnie generally plays the best I've seen of him in recent years.  I believe he was on the wagon for this tour, much to Keef's chagrin.  Other highlights for me were the included versions of Bitch and Gimme Shelter from Shanghai, complete with Mick's intro in mandarin, and the humorous segue about censorship in China preventing the Stones from performing certain songs.  I also liked their performance of the country music song Bob Wills Is Still The King from Texas (of course!).      DVD packaging & included booklet with Biggest Bang seems cheaper than the Four Flicks DVD set from the 2002/2003 tour, as if the whole project was outsourced & cut down to a price.  But this is a minor criticism, and I suppose fair enough, because the more deluxe feeling Four Flicks was very expensive when it first came out, and Biggest Bang isn't bad value for 4 x DVDs.  Sound & vision are excellent.     I didn't catch the Stones shows on the 2005/2006 tour and didn't know, until I watched this DVD, what that tour looked like, or sounded like.  I think I'd have to say the 2005/2006 tour, notwithstanding some great highlights on Biggest Bang, wasn't as good, for some intangible reason, as the 2002/2003 world tour. But I am not necessarily saying Four Flicks is better than Biggest Bang.  They are both different and good in their own ways and Biggest Bang is nevertheless an excellent Rolling Stones DVD set in its own right.    Hey, it's The Stones.  I can't give less than 5 stars.       Postscript:  If you REALLY wanted to see the Stones at their peak, find a bootleg DVD of Ladies & Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones, from their 1972 American tour.  It was a theatrical release in 1974, but I have never seen it officially released on DVD.  I used to have the official release VHS, but now I've got to settle for a bootleg DVD.  Hey guys, let's have the official release of it.  Please!
1881273156|5.0|Every adult should read this book.  It helps you understand your mate and how different expressions of love can look and what you can do to reclaim the love you both thought you once had.  It can also assist with your communication and improved understanding of all your familial relationships.  This book is powerful in its ability to change the direction of a relationship.  Highly recommended.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Ridley Scott did an amazing job here, with an equally amazing effort from cast members Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.  If you do not know what it is about maybe you are living under a rock, this was the movie of the year when it was released.  Gladiator is a phenomenal film that portrays the Gladiators in all their guts and glory.  Within the walls of the coliseum, the final scene plays out with superb, hard-hitting drama.  This movie is not just about fighting it has other aspects to enjoy.  There is family and loyalty, and also a love interest within the story.  Epic, Surreal and Amazing eye candy for any viewer, this film is a modern day classic!  Considering how many movies cannot be in that category for judgment to begin with, that is saying something in this day and age.
B000N3SS80|5.0|This is a great CD for any woman that has love for her man.  Men should try to understand how a woman loves.  My spanish is not good, however, I can makeout what the lyrics are about.

B000O179EK|5.0|I hate it when a studio does preferential releases.  Especially when Blu Ray is outselling HD-DVD 2 to 1!  I'm sure once the format was is over, this will see a release on the opposing format.  It just sucks we have to wait for one of the funniest movies ever made to be watchable on the PS3.
0440238609|2.0|I started reading this book after picking it up many times at the bookstore.  This first one was good, but defintly over my girls head who happens to be a very good reader.  I started talking to people about the series and told them  I was enjoying this book, and they said just watch our for the 2nd and 3rd.  Ok, fiction is fiction right?  I love sci-fi, and I am a born again believer and I would also say we are potter heads and were up till mid-night waiting for the new book.  So I don't go along with what a lot of people think in this area.  However, after reading these books (all three) I see what they meant.  It makes me wonder, why he hates the cathlic church so much.  What happened to him that he is so angry. It is amazing that he is at the same place that greats like Lewis and Toliken came from.  I think that would be a great converasation to watch between the three if they were still alive.  So ok for me as an adult how is not going to go ooh maybe Pullman is right.  It is a work of fiction that is why I gave it 2 stars.  Be careful with your kids.
1594489505|5.0|Like any avid reader it's a special treat when a book transcends what you typically  think of as an excellent book, and envelops you as the reader so that you're virtually at it's mercy until the final page.<br />This was that experience and more. I was lucky enough to read almost the entire story in one sitting, although frankly I don't know how I would've ever put it down after the first one hundred and fifty pages or so, the culminating envents leaving me nearly breathless at times. The two women in this story are so heartbreaking in their courage and fortitude, despite such damning odds, with a country violently descimated by war, and a domestic situation that is taking it's cues from an oppressive, smothering regime.<br />The story is beautifully structured, with subtle payoffs at the end that reap huge emotional rewards for the reader.<br />My favorite book this year.
B000065BPB|1.0|Broken out of box, the cable is shot. So I cannot really comment on the sound, probably is good but I'll never know since the quality is a solid 1 star. I'm returning them for a refund and I'm getting a par of Sony V6s instead.
075640407X|5.0|I am a fan of fantasy. I like the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it laughs when you rub its belly.  Honestly, though, what has always bothered me about fantasy is how it all feels the same; start with a setting that feel like 16th Century England, but don't call it that, add magic, elves and dwarves, stir in a great evil, and let simmer for six thousand pages.    This book has that feel, yet somehow it's put together is such a way that is feels good.  I like the way that Patrick Rothfuss doesn't make the fantastic creatures as fantastic as some fantasy novels, but puts them in a place that feels real and logical.  The magic is there but it's not reserved for the few and privilaged. Those who work hard for it can have it.    Like all first books in a series you are stuck with the tedium of building the basis of the character.  You are forced to slump through the boring bits. but if you get through it and read it all, you come out wanting much, much more.  I am now sitting and waiting for the second book, I must know where the series will go from here.    Great Job Pat.  Keep writting like this and I will keep reading it and writting reviews that praise you like the litterary genious that you are, with my terrible spelling and all.
0140120416|5.0|This book is fantastic.  I'm new to the language and have several resources on hand, but this book is my favorite. It systematically presents key concepts and is very thorough.
031236198X|4.0|John Kotter has successfully written a tale of change management incorporating leadership with a fun, simple twist around perceptions.  The story line is simplistic and easy to read, yet invokes passion about each character.  The charismatic leaders of the penguins, his strong willed chief of staff, the energetic analytical newbie and the relates to everyone member.      John walks through his 8 steps around change and how to handle the cynics, pessimists, perception is reality, traditions and multiple generations effectively and clearly.  It is easy to associate yourself, your leadership teams and staff with every character in the book.  He writes a powerful message that does not end with their success, yet shows how the penguins must continuously change and improve to survive.  An easy read and one that is designed to reinforce his Heart of Change book, not as a new concept.
B000MV9026|4.0|Touching story line! Thourghly enjoyed this movie! My husbands grandkids loved it, too! We all have the movie! The music is catchy and makes you want to stomp your feet right along with the penguins!
B0000041WV|3.0|For decades, reviewers -- just like the 15 or so here that gave this set 5 stars -- tripped over themselves trying to describe to you how great was this set of integral Dvoark symphonies by Istvan Kertesz and the London Symphony Orchestra. And, for decades, it was hard for me to believe that Istvan Kertesz and the 1972-era London Symphony Orchestra could be among the world's greatest exponents of this music.<br /><br />So I waited until I could get this set cheap -- I mean cheap! -- before buying. And, just as I suspected with Karajan's set of Mendelssohn symphonies, when I actually got the thing at home, it wasn't quite what everyone had been saying all that time.<br /><br />I have no particular objection with Kertezs' way with the music. While not as ingrained in the Budapest, Hungary born conductor's soul as it may have been in a Czech conductor such as Ancerl or Vaclav Neumann, his advocacy is strong, if not particularly individual, throughout the set. In addtion, this set includes many recordings that were firsts at a time when the composers symphonies 1-6 were not well documented on vinyl or tape.<br /><br />However, other characteristics of this set put me off to no end. First, and foremost, is the way the CDs are arranged -- in two separate boxes, one with Symphonies 1-6 on four CDs and Symphonies 7-9 on a pair. Why two boxes? I don't know. Why not in cardboard slipcases inside one box, that would save space and not break? Don't ask me.<br /><br />It gets worse, too. In the first box, the first CD contains all of Symphony 1 and a piece of Symphony 2, starting a trend that continues on all four CDs. They are all arranged poorly with one symphony cleaning up (finishing) on the first or second tracks and another one beginning after that. If you've ever played a CD in the car you know how idiotic this seems and how difficult it is to manage. It requires twice the work to play them at home, too.<br /><br />Second, the London Symphony, which was not the world's best in the 1970s, is not the best orchestra for this music. The brass lack the weight and force to drive home the message as clearly and forcefully as Kubelik does it in his collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (with whom he also recorded some outstanding Smetana at about the same time). Be advised the Kubelik set includes many of the same space-saving devices -- cramming three movements each of Symphony 3 and 5 on a single CD -- as this issue.<br /><br />Third, the sound on this issue was probably pretty good for 1973 but is only adequate in 2007. I don't know if this has been remastered in recent years but the set I have does not sound any better than average for its period, with a decidedly two by two perspective. I can't imagine spending much time listening to this with better recordings (some from the same era) and more well-recorded performances available. I can't count a single performance from this set that displaced any of my personal favorites.<br /><br />To its credit, this set includes a nice performance of four Dvorak overtures and tone poems incluidng \\"In Nature's Realm\\" that concludes one of the CDs; three others fill out the \\"New World\\" symphony CD. Still, buyers looking for an integral set of Dvorak symphonies in Czech style should listen closely and compare to the more dramatic but also more costly Kubelik set before investing, in my opinion.<br /><br />Another, perhaps better, alternative is the Dvorak symphony set by Otmar Suitner on Berlin Classics, which is still available new for about $17 from an Amazon vendor. While not the last word in Czech expression, Suitner manifests all the joy of these symphonies -- which occasionally eludes Kertesz -- while capturing most of the drama. Recorded during the 1970s and 1980s, the Berlin State Orchestra isn't presented in the kind of detailed sound we take for granted these days but its playing is warm and Suitner's leadership is very exciting and, by turn, humanistic. Maybe best of all, the Suitner set -- which eschews add ons -- is far more intelligently laid out on five disks, a big improvement over the idiotic foundation of either the Kertesz or Kubelik sets.<br /><br />A side issue to the Suitner set is relatively colorless sound. For listeners looking for better sound in an integral set, the various collections by Vaclav Neumann and the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, which arrive in a trio of 2-CD sets combining the early (1-3), middle (4-6) and late (7-9) symphonies works better and allows the listener to buy only the symphonies (s)he wants. These are outstanding and unique performances by a noted Dvoark expert in wonderful sound. Best of the batch is probably the middle combo with Symphonies 4-6 which scored a 10/10 on [...] for artistry and sound. It may end up costing you more to buy all the symphonies this way but it's a better investment than the Kertesz set.ns -- is far more intelligently laid out on five disks, a big improvement over the idiotic foundation of either the Kertesz or Kubelik sets.

B00005JPQT|3.0|This sequel does not have any thing new. While watching this movie kind of feels that you have already watched a movie with a similar story line. Three starts are only for the action in the movie which is good. Not a kind of movie which a die hard fan would expect.
B000H5U832|4.0|Although I believe the story line was more on an adult level, I also know the animation, bright colors and overall movie is loved by young and old, alike. Every kid I know has this movie for their collection, as well as adults (without kids). Great movie!
B000P0J02E|3.0|The music itself is scored heavily on the percussion, and most of the tracks are bombastic.  The fault in this is the same with the movie: Too many climaxes, and not enough quieter places.
B0000648WZ|4.0|Another in a long line of movies I didn't expect to like, but liked a lot. Starship Troopers has the feel of the best of 1950's Saturday matinee sci-fi serials, updated for the 1990's. It is an interesting movie, has a good plot, has enough action to hold almost anyone's attention (in fact I'm informed Starship Troopers has more shots fired in its run-time than any film ever made...) and is enjoyable end-to-end. As someone told me and as I put in my title up there, if you haven't seen it, you probably should.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|Those that are curious about Genesis will not be dissapointed by this.  Eighteen tracks is enough to introduce you to this wonderful British band.  Most of these tracks are from the Phil Collins era, and two are from the Peter Gabriel era.  Hits from the Phil Collins era include \\"I Can't Dance\\", \\"Misunderstanding\\", \\"Throwing It All Away\\", \\"Land of Confusion\\", \\"Tonight Tonight Tonight\\", \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"That's All\\", and many more incredible hits!  The tracks from the Peter Gabriel era are \\"I know what I like (in Your Wardrobe)\\", and a re-recording of \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\", entitled \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\" in which both Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel reunite with Genesis.  Both these tracks are wonderful songs that deserve all the credit they can get.  One other track, that's not from either of the Collins or Gabriel era, is \\"Congo\\".  A Scotsman named Ray Wilson took Phil Collins place after Phil anounced that he was leaving Genesis.  \\"Congo\\" is decent, and has a bit more of the rock influencnce than some of the other songs.

B00005JPQL|3.0|Fun to watch and some interesting ideas, but I expected much more from a Gaiman film. It's paced a little too slowly. And it's hard to see why so many people keep calling it an \\"adult\\" fairy tale. What's so adult about it? All the killing? I guess our standards have fallen. The Harry Potter series is much more adult in the many themes it explores (love, trust, adulthood, childhood, deceiving appearances, friendship, sacrifice, ...).<br /><br />The \\"hero\\" is kind of iffy in his ethics, in basically enslaving a \\"star\\". I didn't find myself rooting for him.<br /><br />The cinematography is sometimes horrendous, making Claire Danes appear grotesque when the color is desaturated and patchy - makes her look like she has a rash on her cheeks. Some dialogue is funny but it's not consistently witty. Some plot points are silly, such as the idea of the Wall (why isn't that incredibly dangerous hole patched up?) or as how a prince is killed at an inn - why there are no bodyguards in sight. The flying ship looks as realistic as the one in Return of the Mummy - that is to say, not very. Still, worth a rental.
B000001EHS|4.0|I am not a fan of the band but I have to admit that this \\"best of\\" is a very good one.  I can't tell if a song is missing or not, all I can say is that I know every songs on this cd because they have been played of radio very often.  The choice of tracks seems perfect to me.  If you, just like me, love to listen to a cd to bring out some memories of the past, this one will hit right on target. A very good pop rock album !
B000AP04L0|3.0|Based on the enthusiastic reviews from my co-workers, I had high expectations for this movie. And sure enough, the movie started off pretty well, highlighting the petty nonsense that makes office work wretched: daily traffic jams, cutesy co-workers, malfunctioning machines, smarmy bosses and pointless work. And many of the film's catch phrases have made it into office usage -- the infamous \\"TPS\\" report and \\"'Sounds like someone has a case of the Mondays!\\"<br /><br />The film deals with Peter Gibbons, a young programmer who hates his big corporate job. At the instigation of his overbearing girlfriend, he attends a hypnosis session that ends prematurely, leaving him in a blissful state of nonchalance. At work the next day, Gibbons blithely ignores all rules of office and social etiquette. He arrives in casual clothing, plays Tetris all day, removes his cubical walls and asks a cute waitress out to lunch. His newfound lack of caring is perceived as freshness and candor by a couple of efficiency experts bent on reducing headcount.<br /><br />Yet at this point, halfway through the movie, \\"Office Space\\" lost its charm and gains lots of loosely-connected subplots. The hypnosis gimmick that drove the first half is suddenly and inexplicably dropped. The film morphs into comic romance between Gibbons and a waitress played by Jennifer Aniston. Gibbons and a couple of coworkers hatch a harebrained scam to revenge themselves on the company, and that threatens to land them all in the pokey. Aniston argues with her boss, a restaurant manager who expects his staff to be perpetually peppy, with lots of \\"flair\\" decorating their uniforms. All of this activity adds up to very little in the end.<br /><br />For its hits and magic moments, \\"Office Space\\" had plenty of misses. Richard Riehle's \\"Tom Smykowski\\" is a google-eyed, acne-scarred old timer whose panicked mumbling and emotional attachment to office supplies came across as kind of sad. I guess I've known too many real people like him who were marginalized and then forced out of corporations. The soundtrack consists (pointlessly) of quite foul rap music. A subplot about a malfunctioning office machine manages only to be confusing. The satire of peppy theme restaurants lacks punch. As an office worker myself, I was disappointed by the missed opportunities to lampoon office life. Only one character -- Gibbons' blue-collar neighbor Lawrence (Diedrich Bader) is memorable, consistent and likable.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" has contributed more than its share of catch phrases and characters. But its inconsistent characterizations, sloppy plotting, unrelenting vulgarity, gratuitous female nudity and misfiring satire made it as annoying is it was funny.

B000LXH0AE|1.0|I rented this movie last night and was so bored.  But I kept watching in hopes that it would get better.  It didn't.    I rated this movie as a one star, but that is being far too generous.  It would've only gotten half a star, if that were an option, but only because I was stupid enough to rent it.      Harold should have been hit by the bus at the beginning of the movie to put me (and others who felt the same as myself) out of my/our misery.      Will Ferrell is admitted not one of my favorite actors, but his talents were put to waste on this movie.
B00005JPFE|4.0|Pixar has certainly outdone themselves with the animated feature Ratatouille; the story of a young rat named Remy who pairs up with the imbecile (but well meaning) Linguini to form one of the greatest culinary talents Paris has ever seen.<br /><br />Much has been said of the \\"if you put your mind to it\\" angle as well as the staple stereotypes (e.g., \\"don't go near humans,\\" etc.). But what really struck me was what the critique, Anton Ego (voiced by legendary actor Peter O'Toole) said as he was pondering what to write in his food column.<br /><br />\\"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. Last night, I experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto: Anyone can cook. But I realize that only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.\\"<br /><br />Critics in most circles usually have the necessary machinery to get their message across and as Anton Ego pointed out, they -\\"thrive on negative criticism\\" - as this is what causes controversy; a demand; and in most cases, even a need. But Ego also makes his readers (or in the case of the movie, listeners) realize is that despite what any one critic or person says, the most important opinion is that of your own.<br /><br />Well, that's what I got out of it. What did you get out of it?o makes his readers (or in the case of the movie, listeners) realize is that despite what any one critic or person says, the most important opinion is that of your own.

B000000OMB|5.0|At the dawn of the 1980s, the ship of progressive rock had all but foundered on the jagged reefs of musical fashion, weighted down with its leaden pretensions and buoyed on toward ruin by a new wave. Things looked bleak for fans of this once-glorious genre. But then, like a phoenix from the ashes, a band arose from the wreck, borne on the wings of a dragon: Asia.<br /><br />By its very nature, any supergroup is bound to inspire somewhat outsize expectations. But Asia had outsize expectations even for a supergroup. Assembled from the ranks of Yes (Steve Howe), Emerson Lake & Palmer (Carl Palmer), King Crimson (John Wetton), and the Buggles (Geoff Downes), Asia - or the idea of Asia - must have seemed a band of messianic proportions to fans of prog rock. So with outsize expectations firmly in place, Asia proceeded to confound them utterly.<br /><br />The big hits \\"Heat of the Moment\\" and \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" give a good indication of ASIA, both album and band, overall. One can hear traces of King Crimson in Wetton's elephantine bass sound and passionate vocals; there are moments that recall Yes when Howe interweaves his classically-tinged guitar lines with Downes' beefy keyboard textures. But ultimately, this doesn't sound like some alchemical fusion of its members' former bands. Because by focusing their attack into four-minute blasts instead of sprawling LP-length epics, Asia strip prog down to its sinewy core - \\"arena prog\\", if you care to put a label to it, sounding as much like Journey as Genesis. (Early Genesis, that is - in the early 80s, Genesis were blazing many of the same trails as Asia were.)<br /><br />For prog purists, that constituted nothing short of treason. But for listeners who came without preconceptions - i.e. those who sent ASIA soaring to #1 and \\"Heat of the Moment\\" and \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" to #4 and #17, respectively - it sounded pretty damn awesome. The furious \\"Time Again\\", the pulsating \\"Here Comes the Feeling\\", the exuberant \\"One Step Closer\\"... still sounds pretty damn awesome, really. Asia may not have been able to save progressive rock. But they were able to produce a great album, and that's good enough for me.

I guess the movies sayin the guy runnin Iran is a [bundle of sticks]. I figger that makes the Sparta men Americans.<br /><br />Theres a lot of fightin and a lot a blood flyin ever which way.

She says shell look it up. Coupla days later she tells me.<br /><br />Sparta kept the men away from the women, and workin at being good soldiers, until it was time to get married. So the older guys had sex with the younger guys until the older ones got hitched. And they wore leather armor when they fought -- no little briefs, and definitely no capes.<br /><br />That helps partly but it makes me think of another question Im scared to ask. Did they have... boyfriends? My face turns red.<br /><br />Alma Jr looks at me real sweet and says No probly not. All they did was fight. And when they werent fightin they trained really hard.

B000QQFKYE|3.0|I'm a huge David Lynch fan, I've loved every movie of his.  \\"Blue Velvet\\" will always be one of my favorite films, with \\"Mulholland Drive\\" close behind - I've seen them both many, many times.  I was even more excited when I learned this is 3 hours long - a 3 hour David Lynch trip is an exciting and scary idea.  I watched about an hour and a half, waiting for it to grab me, but it didn't, and not because it didn't make sense (that's normal for Lynch), but because, unlike \\"Mulholland Drive\\" or \\"Eraserhead\\", the mystery was leaving me cold.  I kept feeling like he was reusing old ideas, and just simply trying to be complex for the sake of being complex.  I've seen \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\" enough to remember exact shots, scenes and dialogue, and several times those showed up again in this.  Eventually I started thinking this is actually a sequel to \\"Mulholland Drive\\", complete with Laura Harring appearing during the credits.  This is worth watching for a die-hard David Lynch fan, but speaking as a die-hard one, I was disappointed.  I kept getting the feeling that Lynch was too self-conscious in this one - too many scenes and way too much dialogue just came across as \\"I'm David Lynch, being David Lynch\\".  Disc 2 didn't help this - an hour and 15 minutes of deleted scenes (so it could have been four hours and 15 minutes of mystery instead), Lynch cooking (didn't care), Lynch just talking for 40 minutes (didn't care, after watching this film).  I feel like we're not far from having a 30 minute featurette that just shows David Lynch sleeping.  Not much of the film was very original, and unlike \\"Mulholland Drive\\", I didn't find the mystery intriguing or worth trying to understand (the unmade film was named \\"47\\", the room number of the rabbit people - got it, but so?)  I do give this 3 stars because it's worth seeing once, for Lynch fans, and because there are some arresting and disturbing images and ideas that were even new for him - the rabbit people start out as a funny idea and quickly become a creepy one.  And Laura Dern will probably never again have a film role that gives her this wide a range - it's incredible to see the variety of things she goes through and becomes.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|As reality shows continue to flood the airwaves, seemingly crowding out traditional shows, every so often a fresh and inventive show comes along proving that when done right, the sitcom can still provide good comfort television. \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" is such a show. Created by Carter Bays & Craig Thomas, who (along with their band, The Solids) also performed the show's infectious theme song \\"Hey Beautiful,\\" HIMYM stars Josh Radnor as hopeless romantic architect Ted Mosby, who regales his kids (in 2030) with the \\"legendary\\" tales (told in flashbacks dating back to 2005) leading up to how he fell in love.<br /><br />Radnor, who I equate with Zach Braff's John Dorian character of NBC's [[ASIN:B00005JNEQ Scrubs]], really puts himself out there in the role of lovelorn Ted. Jason Segal and Alyson Hannigan are especially great as Ted's soon-to-be-married pals lawyer Marshall and teacher Lily, who as far as I'm concerned, rank as TV's most adorable couple. Cobie Smulders is just fine also as lovely TV news reporter Robin, who the gang playfully tease for being canadian and vice versa, plus the hilarious Neil Patrick Harris as \\"suited up\\" womanizer Barney. Only Harris could pull off this guy and make him somewhat likeable. One of my favorite exchanges between Barney and Lily is in \\"Mary the Paralegal\\" where Lily voices her disgust with Barney [for seemingly setting Ted up with a hooker] with \\"Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low but sadly for you, it's just a new middle.\\" Instead of being offended, Barney proudly raises his chin and grins. Too funny.<br /><br />While the show hews pretty closely to the formulas of [[ASIN:B000H6SXMY Friends]], [[ASIN:B00005JLEX Seinfeld]] and even [[ASIN:6305053987 The Wonder Years]], How I Met Your Mother quickly formed its own rhythm, and in its own right is an original which I always look forward to watching.

B000NQR7NO|3.0|the guitars, the bass lines,  the catchy lyrics, everything is there we've come to expect from the Arctic Monkeys, except one thing... the songs.  Maybe  its just the quality of their first record clouds this offering, but it just falls a bit flat, more so with repeated listening.
0887307280|1.0|There are about a dozen pages throughout this book with useful information on them. The rest is just Gerber rambling on about his business philosophies. Most of the book is just generalized concepts, which were not very useful because there were very few examples to back them up. Additionally, his writing style is extremely annoying (other reviews give examples), especially the dialog between him and his made-up Sarah character, which unfortunately runs throughout the whole book. My suggestion is to just read the reviews which summarize the main concepts of the book, rather than wasting your time reading the book. Either way, you will learn the same amount.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|I have to say, this is a great movie, and the blu-ray version makes it even better. I watched both the normal and blu-ray versions and there is a huge difference in quality - blu-ray is far more clear and vibrant.
B000035Z1Z|3.0|I used to really like this movie, French Kiss starring Meg Ryan but it is a little dated and cliched now. Kevin Kline is excellent and Ryan brings hypersensitvity and vulnerablity to this film but the story is just your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. If you want a great Meg Ryan movie, I would watch When Harry Met Sally or Sleepless in Seattle.

B00005JLKB|5.0|I have all five seasons thats out and cant wait till season six comes out next month. I already have mine pre-ordered. All I can say is watch it! You have to be just a little in love with comic book type movies like Spiderman, Xmen and Fantastic 4. Im not saying you have to be a die hard fan of comics or Superman but you gotta at least like this kinda genre. There are some episodes that will make you go \\"Wow thats just crap.\\" Because they are kinda slow and not really telling you anything or progressing in the story line. You have to bite your lip through those episodes which are few and far between. Season 1 and season 5 I think are the two best. Seasons 2-4 are good but there really just filler I think. Season 1 has some of the cool abilities come to life and also lets you get to know everyone in Smallville. Season 2-4 gets you more and I believe all of his abilities out in the open. (could be wrong on that) New Good Guys and Villains galore! Now Season 5 heats up and has some really good last few episodes that will have you kicking the tv for more! I threw my remote across the room because of how that season ends. All I can say is Cliff Hanger!!!!!! All in all Im bias because I just really fell in love with this TV Series. Im a huge comic fan so like I said Im kinda bias. Worth it? HECK FREAKING YES AND THEN SOME WITH EXTRA EXTRA SOME!!
B000001GXI|4.0|I was very lucky to have happened to get this recording.  Knowing very little to nothing of the vocalists, I had gone to Borders to pick up a recording of 'Zauberflote' and they had 3 - I chose this one, mostly just because of Otto Klemperer and to some extent Karl Boehm.<br /> Within the first 15 minutes of listening to the opera, I was a die-hard Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau fan.  I have an enormous crush on him.  I very much look forward to exploring this wonderful artist's other recordings.  If he ever performed anywhere near the States, I would go see him.  I also like Fritz Wunderlich as Tamino, and was very sorry to learn that he passed away at the age of 36.<br />  The male voices in this recording are all superb.  The female voices are not quite up to that par.  Evelyn Lear's voice is nowhere near that league, though it's nice enough. And I didn't like Roberta Peters very much.  When you have a recording of Sumi Jo singing \\"Der Rache Holler...\\" (I do) it taints you a little.<br />  All that said, I recommend this recording without reserve.
B00004SVID|4.0|Why the hell did Pink Floyd decide to release this live document of one of rock 'n' roll's greatest records in the year 2000?  Couldn't they have released this back in 1982 for some reason?  Anyway an excellent live performance of The Wall as it was originally done back in 1980-81.  This is the third live release by the band and it rocks from start to finish although nothing compares to the original 1979 double album.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I loved this movie!  (I have not yet read the book, but have it on reserve at the library)  I liked that it had some strong, intelligent (though not perfect) female characters.  Almost all of the characters are developed enough that I understood what drove them. I could also see a visible evolution of several characters throughout the movie as they were exposed to new people, cultures and ways of thinking.      I thought it portrayed fairly both sides of the workers and masters of the mills of the time.  I felt the awful struggle of the poor workers as well as the varying attitudes of the masters.    I appreciated that the movie was clean, yet had enough \\"chemistry\\" going on to keep the romance lover part of me hoping for a happy ending.
0374105235|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book, as it enabled me to understand the dynamics involved with these children are dragged kicking and screaming into a warriors life. I can appreciate the struggle he has had in returning to a quiet normal life. The story was well told, in clear concise language, he told the story evocatively and with a fair amount of emotion. It is nice to see something good come from all of his troubles, Ishmael was nothing more than a young man tossed into a very, very bad situation, he made the best of it and came through the other side to tell us his story. I listened to the audio version of this book, and in his own words, this story was compelling and at some places I was driven to tears.
B000GB775E|3.0|This is the old \\"boy meets girl-boy loses girl\\" tradition of romantic comedy.

B000RIWAVW|2.0|I had already posted this below in the discussion area, but this quote taken from an early review of this \\"new\\" edition over at DVDActive pretty much says everything that needs to be said about this release. Hopefully it will save many of you some trouble:<br /><br />\\"I've got to say this is a nice new slipcover. It features the original poster image, with a shiny rainbow hologram knife, title, and pumpkin face. The image itself is also raised. I wonder what's beneath this cardboard shell. Why, it's the original 1999 Anchor Bay release! Right down to the packaging! How about that? The video quality is identical to the original 1999 THX release because this is the EXACT SAME DISC. In 2005 Anchor Bay released a 25th anniversary version under their quickly defunct 'Divimax' series. The 2005 release was hated by some fans because of its colour correction, which was made without input from Dean Cundey. This release, the 1999 version, was supervised by Cundey, but is a lot dirtier, and somewhat darker. I personally can't decide which transfer I prefer, because I actually kind of like the bluish tint on the 2005 release. Halloween is also one of the few movies of the era that works when cleaned to modern crispness (sometimes too much digital cleansing actually hurts a gritty horror flick, but Halloween is slicker than most).<br />And because this is a re-release of the '99 release, people who hate movies can also watch Halloween is full-screen mode. In this mode the viewer can wonder with wild abandon as to why the music has suddenly become scary when they don't see Michael Myers enter stage right.\\"<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Bottom line: If you have the 1999 edition (still in print and available new through Amazon, might I add)--save your money on another shameless cash-in.

B00005JPAO|4.0|Obviously Princess Diana was a heavily celebrated individual and perhaps with good reason.  Her death was a tragedy and millions mourned.  Perhaps an inferior film would've focused more on her legacy and the behind the scenes feelings that Queen Elizabeth II had regarding The Princess of Wales.  But such expression on film is probably beyond reality as the Queen is by no means a visually emotional person.  Her opinions are more of an enigma and much of that is due to her discipline as Queen.  That is why the story of the interactions between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II on how Diana's death should be treated is worth telling the way it has been here.  I don't think I came to that conclusion until half way through the movie, so I found it to be a very compelling film.<br /><br />It opens with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) winning the general election for Prime Minister.  Blair was of course an advocate to modernize the country so his early interactions with the Queen (Helen Mirren) were guarded right from the very beginning.  Princess Diana is soon killed in car wreck while being chased by paparazzi and Tony Blair delivers a speech that coins the title \\"the People's Princess\\" for Diana.  The Queen of course notes that Diana is technically no longer royalty as she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier.  She believes that the handling of Diana's funeral is to be a private affair and expresses this to Blair.  The result is of course a solid exploration of media hysteria, the Queen's devotion to her vows, and the contemporary dynamics of Royalty for better or worse.  All of these things are certainly elements I knew little about, at least to the extent it is observed here. I'm sure there are inaccuracies somewhere in this picture but not enough for me to pick up on.<br /><br />There are four things that make this film exceptional.  Director Stephen Frears (the Grifters, Dirty Pretty Things) and screenplay writer Peter Morgan (The Last King of Scotland) did an outstanding job in their respective roles.  There is no question that creating a convincing portrayal of this story is no easy task but they managed to pull it off.  The other two items are the performances by Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and Helen Mirren as the Queen.  Sheen was a bit overshadowed by Mirren's performance but he is definitely great.  Mirren's acting on the other hand was universally hyped as the best performance of 2006.  Having seen the film well after the hype and awards I was certainly prepared to be critical of anything but there is no question about it, Mirren was outstanding and deserved her many glowing reviews, standing ovations, and awards.  The Queen is not necessarily written to be likable but she is still the focus of the film and Mirren takes on the task of making her enjoyable to watch and even to some degree relatable.<br /><br />The Queen is a movie that some people will find slow, it is hardcore drama within a historical context that some will find less entertaining without a certain degree of back story.  If you found interest in what happened ten years ago in the aftermath of Diana's death then you will likely enjoy this film tremendously.  If for some reason that isn't your thing then you may want to take heed.heir respective roles.

B000PY52EU|1.0|I absolutely hated this racist film.  White people believe the only good Black folks are the ones that do for them and neglect their own people.<br /><br />Black women need men (70 percent of Black women have no mates) and this racist filth does nothing but promote to unsuspecting impressionable Black men to do for White women, no matter how slutty, filthy, nasty, and pedophiles they are. Christina Rucci's character RAPES a 14 year old Black boy with no punishment--just like during slavery.<br /><br />Decent White people in the theater noticed it because I saw several walk out the theater in disgust.<br /><br />This movie is only for racist and ignorant Black folks.  Why else did the director put the confederate flag on her filthy little t-shirt during half the movie?  So, to make sure those enligtened ones are NOT missing the racist intent.  What arrogance??????<br /><br />Pearl Jr.<br />Black Media Review

B000065V9Y|5.0|When \\"Us\\" was released in 1992, it immediately became a steady staple in my musical diet.  It was the perfect musical acompaniment to a rocky relationship I was wrestling with.  The album stayed in heavy rotation for two years, until most of my collection was stolen during a drug addict break-in.<br /><br />I wasn't aware of this 2002 remaster release until last month, when I was perusing Amazon for those few remaining CDs that I haven't managed to replace yet.<br /><br />Replete with subtle, complex musical arrangements and intensely humane lyrics, \\"Us\\" is Peter Gabriel's best, most complete album.  \\"So\\" is a close second, but there are a few tracks on \\"So\\" that seem like mere filler.  Not so on \\"Us.\\"  Every track seems purposefully crafted and included, with the possible exception of \\"Fourteen Black Paintings\\" (not a bad song at all, just sounds more like it belongs on a movie soundtrack).  I suppose you could also argue that the two mainstream pop-esque songs, \\"Steam\\" (which I always thought was similar to -- but much better than -- \\"Big Time\\") and \\"Kiss That Frog,\\" don't quite harmonize with the overall emotional tenor of \\"Us,\\" but I won't quibble with greatness.  \\"Come Talk to Me\\" is a compelling opening and invitation, followed immediately by the beautiful and moving \\"Love to be Loved\\" and \\"Blood of Eden.\\"  And you can't find more musical honesty and integrity than showcased in \\"Washing of the Water\\" and \\"Digging in the Dirt.\\"<br /><br />The remastered version superbly highlights the many acoustic nuances that were so painstakingly crafted by Gabriel.  Can't recommend it highly enough -- just make sure to treat yourself to excellent speakers or headphones that can really showcase everything going on here.  Then sit back and sail away.  Wrestling with heartache never felt so good.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Pros:   What a wonderful love story full of restraint passion! Every ever-so-slight touch of a hand between the two main characters gives you shivers! I'm a big fan of period piece movies, and this is one of the best!   Cons:   I can't stop swooning over Richard Armitage.
B000002UAF|5.0|When this soundtrack album came out in the summer of 1964 - on Parlophone in the U.K. and Capitol in North America - it was an instant # 1 on both sides of the Atlantic - but the rewards didn't stop there.<br /><br />Two tracks - Can't Buy Me Love [# 1 for 5 weeks] and its flipside You Can't Do That [# 48] - had already been hit singles earlier in the spring. Another # 1 single - the title song - then sprang from the album in July, b/w I Should Have Known Better [# 52], followed simultaneously by one more - And I Love Her [# 12] b/w If I Fell [# 53].<br /><br />And if that wasn't enough, yet ANOTHER hit single - I'll Cry Instead [# 25] b/w I'm Happy Just To Dance With You [# 95] - followed early in August. So this was indeed an album that generated revenue from two very lucrative aspects of the market,<br /><br />All were composed by Lennon-McCartney, as were the remaining album tracks - which weren't too shabby either. Indeed, I think I'll Be Back would have made still one more hit single had they taken that route back then. The liner notes may be a bit skimpy for some, but the AAD sound reproduction is perfect.

Luckily, I didn't open the second one and I'm going to try to return it.  I have the original recording of this in vinyl and was so looking forward to listening to this again.  Just be sure you know what you are dealing with in the way of technology here or you'll get tripped up.

I was in high school during Anne's time in hiding and of course I heard about her after the war ended.  It seemed to be a true copy of the diary without embellishment and I appreciated the footnotes for things I had never heard of before. It's a fast read and I recommend it highly.
B000000OSG|4.0|It's hard to believe Axl Rose, Duff McKagan and Slash wrote the song \\"Civil War,\\" the first tune from the wild \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" album. Not that the three aforementioned Gunners aren't tremendous songwriters, but \\"Civil War\\" is simply the best, most poignant anti-war song I've ever heard. Frankly, you might not expect such deep insight from a band that only four years earlier was ranting about the perils of drugs, sex and all things seedy in Hollywood, as heard on the classic [[ASIN:B000000OQF Appetite for Destruction]]. In any case, \\"Civil War's\\" somber message is contrasted almost comically with lighter-weight fare on \\"Illusion II,\\" such as the mostly ridiculous \\"Get in the Ring,\\" which starts off with a hokey cheering crowd and a guitar lick reminiscent of a Budweiser commercial; from there, \\"Get in the Ring\\" gets worse, as Axl Rose's spastic, mean-spirited lyrics devolve into a curse-laden rant against magazine writers from the early 1990s who don't even matter anymore. Axl ends the song with an evil laugh that's so ridiculous it has probably made many a listener laugh as well. Another dud on the CD is the Duff-penned \\"So Fine,\\" which might just rank as the worst Guns n' Roses tune ever made. Duff helps sing (and breathe heavy) on the song, a corny love ballad that sounds as if it was written by a teenager just getting started in his first rock `n' roll band. \\"So Fine\\" improves during the middle and latter portions when it rocks out a bit, and Slash's guitar solo is cool - as always - but mostly it's a sorry affair.<br /><br />That said, there are plenty of awesome songs on \\"Illusion II,\\" beginning with Izzy Stradlin's cool jukebox rocker \\"14 Years,\\" where he takes care of lead vocals in his Axl-like voice and Axl himself provides some impressive background vocals. Following \\"14 Years,\\" three other musicians helped Rose write the sentimental and impressive \\"Yesterday,\\" where Axl forcibly and prophetically sings, \\"Some things could be better/If we'd all just let them be.\\"<br /><br />The middle of the CD, beginning with \\"Shotgun Blues,\\" offers a solid string of good, unique tunes that rock out splendidly. \\"Shotgun Blues\\" is an angry mixture of metal and punk; the ambitious \\"Breakdown\\" is a wild ride of varied sounds and Rose-penned lyrics that might have come straight from his latest therapy session; \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" boasts a killer riff and dirty lyrics reminiscent of the band's debut record; and \\"Locomotive,\\" which also boasts a great riff and is a Rose-Slash concoction that clocks in at 8:42, might be the ultimate G n' R tune: frantic, sad lyrics about unrequited love; an addictively chugging (no pun intended) guitar riff; thumping drums; and an overall sense of lostness in a crazy world. When it came out, I always felt \\"Locomotive\\" had a truly modern rock `n' roll sound that was somehow ahead of its time, plus was an indication of what might have come from future G n' R CDs.<br /><br />Arguably, though, nothing the band has recorded tops Rose's \\"Estranged,\\" one of the most heartfelt, isolated and, indeed, scary tunes I've ever heard. Rose was truly depressed when he wrote the song (suicidal, actually), and that feeling comes through in spades when you hear it. \\"When you're talking to yourself/And nobody's home/You can fool yourself/You came in this world alone,\\" Rose sings in a quivering voice to begin the song. Slash's melodious, soaring guitar immediately kicks in to give the song some weight, while Rose, suddenly a beacon of sensitivity, again wails on about his romantic travails. \\"Estranged\\" is divided into three epic portions, each equally moving, and clocks in at 9:23. Yes, the video for the song may have been overblown and mortifying in its self-centeredness, a sign of the big-rock era coming to an end, but \\"Estranged\\" was also one of the best pieces of work G n' R ever created.<br /><br />Back when they were hugely popular, it seemed everyone in and around Guns n' Roses worked to serve the songs with the musical talent they had to offer; this was before the days when Axl tried to completely run the show. On \\"Illusion II,\\" Slash is everywhere with his searing guitar, Axl's voice and his feeling behind it are equally as searing, Dizzy Reed provides solid piano on many songs, and the songs themselves are a valid and impressive attempt by the band to expand its musical depth. Productionwise, these tunes aren't any more prettied up than the songs on \\"Appetite.\\" Sure, they might be busier and more ambitious, but G n' R stayed pretty true to its roots on both \\"Illusion\\" CDs, which makes one wish they had remained together to see what the future would have held.t they had to offer; this was before the days when Axl tried to completely run the show.

038073186X|3.0|If \\"Shutter Island\\" hadn't been a book club selection I wouldn't have finished the book and missed the climax to a plodding beginning. John D. MacDonald did a hurricane in \\"Condominium\\" with greater impact on the psychic. Mr. Lehane's vivid prose trudges along at precise pace which gives the reader no relief, no break in the  anticlimactic action until you wonder if his fingers stumbled over the keyboard.<br />The opening with Dr. Sheehan's efforts to record an event 39 years in the past sets the tone of unimportance, cowardliness and evil intent on the part of the authorities to maintain a private \\"experimental\\" facility with funding from federal sources. The treatment of the \\"criminally insane\\" is a dark period in the annals of psychiatry, but the reader knows from the moment Teddy surrenders his gun he will never leave the island alive. Hence there is no mystery or suspense, just a cataloging of episodes to reach the last page.<br />Nash Black, author of \\"Sins of the Fathers\\" and \\"Qualifying Laps.\\"
B0002STNQ2|4.0|Michael Crichton was born in Chicago, Illinois on October 23, 1942. He was educated at Harvard University. He has written many page-turning suspense novels, many containing cutting edge technology and all of them are extremely well researched. He is probably best known as the author of `Jurassic Park' but has had several best selling novels since then. Jurassic Park was published in 1980. Difficult to believe I know.    Out in the middle of the Nevada desert there is trouble brewing. Trouble that is a serious threat to the whole human race. An experiment has gone terribly wrong. A cloud of nano particles, to all intents and purposes micro robots has escaped from a laboratory. The cloud is able to sustain itself and in its own way it has intelligence. This intelligence increases as it learns from experience. The cloud is evolving quickly and as time passes it become even more deadly. So far every attempt to destroy it has failed. This could be the worst thing the human race has ever had to face . . .

B000784WMW|5.0|I decided to borrow four screen versions of \\"Jane Eyre\\" from the library to find my favorite. I watched a 1996, a 1997, a 2006, and this one. Timothy Dalton transforms from a haughty, bitter Rochester to one who has fallen in love with the plain, but dimpled Jane. He portrays the constant struggle going on within Rochester, and yet conveys the boyish love he is feeling for his \\"little Janet\\".  Yes, Mr. Dalton is too attractive for Mr. Rochester, but plays him wonderfully.  Zelah Clarke annoyed me the first time I watched it because she seemed to pause so long before speaking her lines. Perhaps this was the director's fault.  Anyhow, she still gives a life to Jane that makes her real to me, although she is not as young as Jane should be. Several lines are directly from the book.  I admit I don't watch the episodes with Jane as a child repeatedly as I do her adult years. Remember this version is at least 5 hours long, so you have to be a true Charlotte Bronte/Jane Austen type fan to love it as I do. It definitely brings the most life to the book if you are teaching \\"Jane Eyre\\", even if you only show some of the episodes and not all.  The other members of the cast are equally outstanding.

B000000W5N|5.0|I have mixed feelings about the Stones, but this album is just great, all the way through.  The second half of \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" could be mistaken for Santana.  \\"Sister Morphine\\" is poetic and plain spooky, and \\"Moonlight Mile\\" is gorgeous.  Sticky Fingers catches the band at their apex, well before they started to seem like a parody of themselves, but happily removed from the early stuff like \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" -- they seem to be right where they want to be, playing around with the sounds they love the most: country, blues, latin, Otis Redding-style soul (\\"I've Got the Blues\\").  If not their \\"best\\" (Let it Bleed?), still one of the great albums of that time.  Any time, really.
B00000DGUY|3.0|A few points I will list here to rank this CD's quality. First, editing of major tracks (already noted by previous reviewers). Second, the exclusion of three important songs: Skateaway, Expresso Love and Industrial Disease. Finally, an upscale remark. This `Very Best Of' indeed contains the band's prime hits no matter what mode they be arranged. So, to keep this review short but honest if you love Dire Straits why not purchase this CD for your collection. However, if you love your music collection more than Dire Straits best consider another CD and enjoy without any regrets.

B00004YMVC|5.0|When David Sylvian's twenty year relationship with Virgin Records came to an end, he delivered two compilations to them drawn from his catalog, a vocal compilation (\\"Everything and Nothing\\") and an instrumental one (\\"Camphor\\").  Both were initially released as limited editions with bonus discs and eventually saw wider release without the bonus disc.  Together, they provide a fantastic overview of the bulk of Sylvian's work, and while some of his decisions (particularly with respect to the Japan material) may irk some of his longtime fans, the value of these sets-- both to the unitiated and old hands, is difficult to estimate.    \\"Everything and Nothing\\" is the vocal piece, two discs of superb material, drawn from Sylvian's albums and collaborations.  Around a dozen or so pieces are new, unreleased or rerecorded, with a few rarities thrown in the mix as well.  I could probably argue about track selection here and there, but really the set is incredibly well put together-- many of Sylvian's finest moments are captured here, from the triumph or \\"Orpheus\\" to the darkness of Rain Tree Crow's \\"Every Colour You Are\\", the deep funk of Robert Fripp-collaboration \\"Jean the Birdman\\", the off kilter techno-tinged \\"The Scent of Magnolia\\" or the downright bizarre (and brilliant) \\"Pop Song\\".  It's really hard to overstate just how good this material is.  For the longtime fans and collectors, a couple shelved tracks that had acheived legendary status get aired out here-- Japan leftover \\"Some Kind of Fool\\" and \\"Secrets of the Beehive\\" outtake \\"Ride\\".  Quite honestly, both are quite as good as myth had built them up to be, something highly unexpected.      Sylvian did in a few cases choose to rerecord vocals, most notably on \\"Some Kind of Fool\\" and perhaps Japan's apex, \\"Ghosts\\".  This stung quite a few folks who really loved this material.  Personally, I've no issue with this.    The limited edition release came with a bonus disc-- a four track single for \\"The Scent of Magnolia\\" containing a nearly pointless edit of the title track (trimming about 30 seconds off of it.  The remaining three tracks include remixes of \\"The Scent of Magnolia\\" and \\"Brilliant Trees\\", but the real value in the bonus disc comes in the studio recording of Fripp/Sylvian piece \\"The Blinding Light of Heaven\\".  A fierce live piece, it picks up a midtempo lope and an unusual grace that you'd never guess could have been from this song based on the live recordings released.  If you can find it, it's a wortwhile pickup.  The limited edition (which this is) is distinguisable by its third disc.    Whether the 2 or 3 disc variant of this, \\"Everything and Nothing\\" is a superb overview of David Sylvian's vocal catalog.  Highly recommended.
B00005JPQL|5.0|This 2007 Victorian-era fantasy took me by surprise and most pleasantly, as the ads make it sound like it would be a CGI-saturated conglomeration of [[ASIN:B000BKVQTS The Brothers Grimm]] and [[ASIN:B00005LOKQ The Princess Bride]] with a little [[ASIN:B0000844JJ Time Bandits]] thrown in for good measure.  What it turns out to be is an adult fairy tale that doesn't make the mistake of taking itself too seriously. Even though much of the credit belongs to the source, the highly acclaimed [[ASIN:0061142026 1997 graphic novel]] by Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess, director and co-screenwriter Matthew Vaughan (along with co-writer Jane Goldman) does an impressive job balancing the comically ribald and pitch-black elements into a compelling albeit rather convoluted plot gift-wrapped in a romantic adventure.<br /><br />The fanciful tale centers on Tristan, a gawky shop boy who is completely smitten with the beauteous Victoria, who is naturally to be engaged to the more dashing Humphrey within the week. Tristan and Victoria strike a deal whereby she will marry him only if he can deliver a falling star to her before Humphrey proposes. In order to do so, Tristan must pass through the sacred wall into the magical kingdom of Stronghold, his birthplace and where his mother may still be held captive. There in a newly formed crater, he finds Yvaine, a star that has fallen out of the firmament against her will. Now vulnerably earthbound, Yvaine also elicits the attention of two unsavory characters - Prince Septimus, Stronghold's remaining heir, who wants a jewel necklace she wears in order to ensure his ascendancy to the throne, and Lamia, a 400-year old witch looking to reclaim her youth and beauty by taking out Yvaine's heart...literally. Their paths criss-cross throughout the film in ways both dazzling and scarifying.<br /><br />To Vaughan's credit, the movie never feels overwhelmed by the special effects necessary to sustain the fantasy, including airborne galleons, mystical creatures, and all the magical shape transformations due to witchcraft. Moreover, it's the sharp wit of his and Goldman's script and the quicksilver pacing that really keeps the story aloft in an unexpected manner. The casting is close to ideal. As Tristan, the reluctant hero, Charlie Cox elevates a potentially callow role into one with genuine romance and indiscriminate vigor. At first, with her contemporary sensibilities, Claire Danes' ironic take on Yvaine feels a bit off, but she transitions nicely into the heartfelt aspects of her ethereal role. Making her venal Velma Von Tussle in [[ASIN:B00005JODK Hairspray]] look like a suburban amateur by comparison, Michelle Pfeiffer has a grand time playing Lamia switching back and forth from her stunning beauty to decaying harridan, all the while plotting and conniving her way to her end goal. She has obviously entered a phase of her career where she feels comfortable acting malicious without remorse and sending up her incredible looks.<br /><br />In brief roles, Sienna Miller perfectly captures Victoria's capricious and superficial nature, Rupert Everett epitomizes gallows wit as the splattered Secundus, and Ricky Gervais goes for the funny bone as the opportunistic Ferdy the Fence. Even Peter O'Toole shows up as a dying king (perhaps coincidentally, he played an actor playing a similar part in last year's [[ASIN:B000NOKFHG Venus]]), and Ian McKellan provides the stentorian narration. However, the real scene stealer is Robert DeNiro, doing little to hide his Bronx accent, as Captain Shakespeare, who maintains a surprising dual identity to keep up appearances for his crew. It's hardly his finest hour, but he is far more amusing here than in [[ASIN:B00005JN5T Meet The Fockers]].  The technical aspects of this sprawling, imaginative world are first-rate, in particular, Gavin Bocquet's meticulous production design (he was responsible for the design of the latest [[ASIN:B00003CX5P Star Wars]] trilogy) and Ben Davis's stellar cinematography. This is superb entertainment for fans of this genre.b entertainment for fans of this genre.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Okay, here's the deal: if you have read Pride and Prejudice and loved it, do NOT watch this movie unless you want to go on an unrewarding emotional journey: first you will hoot laughing, and then cry in despair,  and then become angry and hurl insults (and possibly rotten garbage) at your dvd player. If you are not a reader and are not a fan of Jane Austen, then you might find this somewhat amusing. I guess. I wouldn't know because I was so outraged by this \\"adaptation.\\" I like to think of it more as an abomination, because that's what it is. The costumes are awful, the writer's and actors' interpretations of the characters is dreadful, and the whole thing is a hideous mess of a movie.<br />Keira Knightley is fine in movies like \\"Bend it Like Beckham\\" and \\"Pirates,\\" but she cannot carry a true period drama. (By the way, is anyone else distracted by her mouth? It is CONSTANTLY open -- watch for it in \\"Pirates\\" as well). Darcy, Bingley, and the Bennett parents barely resemble the characters as Austen wrote them, and Wickham is hardly present! There is NO chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy either. Ugh, the whole thing is just terrible.<br /> Do yourself a favor and watch (or re-watch) the A&E BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. Okay, so they made up the scene with Darcy at the pond, but it's a pardonable (and saucy) addition to an otherwise extremely faithful and beautiful rendition of Pride and Prejudice. If you haven't seen the BBC version, by all means skip the Keira Knightley debacle and go straight to the real thing!

I could not put this book down!  I have ordered Ms. Weir's other books about Lady Jane Grey, Henry VIII's court and Elizabeth. After reading this book, you will look at the Tower of London, Hampton Court, Hever Castle, etc. in a completely different way when in London.  You have to hand it to the Brits; they have the most interesting and fascinating history of all.

0099457156|2.0|Looking to kill a few hours poolside I was hoping for a 'typical' Grisham courtroom thriller and picked this up.  I must say that the hours at poolside did pass eventually and without fatalities, but I was disappointed in this novel.  It's not his very worst, but it's certainly not up to the level of storytelling which made John Grisham's early books so tense.    The plot has been summarized by so many other reviewers there is no point in rehashing it here; suffice to say that yes, there are courtroom scenes, but they and any legal wrangling behind the trial do not form in any way the central part of the book.  A crime is committed, the culprit identified, tried and sentenced, and then the second half of the book gets started.      This is too bad because the story Grisham really wants to tell, about small-town life in Mississippi cast against a background where the Vietnam, Civil Rights, race relations and school integration struggles are all raging, drags and meanders for substantial parts of the book, and the central character (the narrator) comes across as a little bit overly correct.    Several of the secondary small-town characters are well-drawn and Grisham does bring out the atmosphere well.  But he uses them all ultimately to tell the story first of a young and somewhat callow man who grows into a more mature human being (which is fine if much better done by countless other writers), and second of a woman, the juror of the title, who is so earnestly and reverently portrayed that the Virgin Mary, Mother Teresa, and Gandhi would frankly be jealous of the treatment.  Grisham's point is perfectly clear, absolutely hammer on the head clear, but it would be made far more effectively if the characters were a bit more believeable.  The crimes and legal action in the book wind up just being the device by which Grisham presents these two main characters, and frankly the payoff just isn't worth the effort.

0684857219|2.0|This thing reads more like the morning work schedule for a Soviet gulag than it does an encyclopedia for bodybuilding. Seriously, 25 sets (not reps, SETS) of squats per workout?  That's like 200 squats for some people!  Come on dude.    The workout program (really more like Arnold's personal interpretation of the death march) is done on split days, six days a week and consists of a practically inhuman list of some 40+ exercises. This isn't even counting the 150 situps recommended before every workout. Hilariously, Arnold even gives the reader the option of repeating this same workout later in the day!    Each workout takes about three hours to get through. I know because I actually did the whole thing using about half of what I normally lift on each exercise as a safety precaution and was still utterly exhausted afterwards. If Arnold had had contact with anyone between the years 1965 and 1980 that wasn't a genetically engineered mass of steroids he would know that this program could kill a normal human being if done consitently and realistically should be cut in half.    The exercises listed range from the useless (Dumbell Flys), to the dangerous (T-Bar Rows), to the utterly impossible (Hanging Reverse Crunches). Still, the danger is not so much the length of the program since virtually everyone is going to hit a wall after about a week of doing these exercises. The fact that Arnold totally neglects any explanation on how to do even the usefull exercises properly is what is far more troubling since naive beginners are going to treat this book as if it were Holy Writ. Books like these really need to stress the dangers of not doing an exercise correctly because mistakes happen in the gym all the time and when you're lifting poundages that are heavier than you yourself weigh you aren't going to walk away with just a muscle pull. More likely you're going to be looking at a tear, a hernia, joint damage, you know, injuries that might be with you for the rest of your life.This book simply doesn't stress this fact enough and the two or three sentences given to describe the performance of each exercise is absolutely ridiculous.     Buy Stuart McRobert's \\"The Insider's Tell-All Handbook on Weight Training Technique.\\" The title sounds cheesy but the book isn't at all. There are pages and pages on how to perform each exercise without injury and unlike Arnold's book McRobert sticks to explaining exercises that are actually worth doing.    I'll refrain from giving this book only 1 star because unlike a lot of bodybuilding books it does provide some useful tips on nutrition. Also unlike many other books in this genre it actually does provide a workout schedule (however hair-brained it may be) and goes into some detain in defending the benefits of split training. Thus it gives you something of a framework from which to map out your own schedule.

B000R4SMCW|3.0|**No Spoilers**<br />Is there such a thing as a perfect crime? Perhaps, but Fracture is far from it. Basically, we are dealing with a romantic crime drama that turns into a Court TV/TLC Channel Forensic Science episode, until the clich&eacute; ending. We still don't understand why Fracture is being praised by so many critics when the real fractures are its obvious flaws--editing, draggy moments, awkward dialogue and the \\"what were they thinking\\" grand finale. Despite the respectable performance by Hopkins and the eye candy cinematography, the film drags forever and it's not as clever as it appears to be.<br /><br />Story:<br />The meticulous (and very rich) structural engineer Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) knows very well that his beautiful wife Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz) is having an affair--obviously with a younger fellow. He wastes no time and once they are alone in their house, he shoots her right in the face. Police arrest him for attempted murder--she is still alive, but unfortunately in a coma.<br /><br />The cocky young attorney Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) has been assigned to be the prosecutor against Ted who confessed his crime, right at the scene, to the negotiator Detective Rob Nunally (Billy Burke)--who is the only man that heard his confession and also Jennifer's lover. Willy thinks that his case--because the confession and all--is an easy one and shouldn't take long to close it and he doesn't know that Rob was seeing Jennifer. Our young lawyer is also about to get a high-paid job for a bigger firm--his new boss will be the sexy Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike). Willy and anybody else for that matter don't know that Ted is not your regular jealous old husband, but a smart and dangerous man who knows the law very well and it will use it to his advantage. As the story progresses, things get complicated for Willy who cannot find any hard evidence against Ted--Willy's career and personal life are also in jeopardy.<br /><br />Review:<br />Fracture opens up pretty much a la Basic Instinct--the slick cinematography along with the love scenes--but there is no build up or character development before the shooting incident. We just see Ted planning his fatal crime in a very generic way. After he tried to kill his wife and goes to jail, then the film turns into a long version of the TV show Law & Order where nothing is what it seems with the traditional mumbo jumbo lawyer talk. At this point, the movie revolves mostly on Willy's motives and personal life. The proud lawyer who finally found a case that he really cares about. He wants to do the right thing, but his situation is so desperate that at one point, he wants to bring down the engineer at any cost even if he has to lie or loose his new job. While in Jail, Ted enjoys all of this and plays silly mind games with Willy. The chemistry between these two actors is very little. Predictably, the star of the film is Hopkins who gives us a decent performance as the evil cold blooded man who wanted to get even with his wife--not hard from him because he often plays these kinds of roles.<br /><br />Director Gregory Hoblit needs to know what this is not a TV movie. His experience in the small screen is painfully obvious--visually pretty, but TV-like nevertheless. The movie drags for most the film--we get unnecessary scenes like a Thanksgiving dinner where the dialogue is preposterous. Not only that, the worst part is towards the end of the film. They portray Ted as the smartest man in the courtroom, but the clich&eacute; ending makes you think twice about his intelligence.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Too long to be a Law & Order episode and too boring to be the next Basic Instinct, Fracture deals with an angry senior citizen who cannot stand his unfaithful wife and decides to kill her. Perhaps there is a fracture in our legal system and the movie tries to show that anyone with knowledge of the law can get around it. Whatever they writers wanted, those draggy moments and clich&eacute; ending ruins all of the other good aspects of the film.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|When I first heard the first song off of Snakes & Arrows...Far Cry on the radio I knew it was going to be another  great album by Rush. They have always put out great albums and Snakes & Arrows is it! Just purchased yesterday and from first listen it is a pure rock album that is refreshing to hear especially in this day and age. All songs on this new album Snakes & Arrows are excellent. This band has been around/together for over 30 years and I can hear why. The album cover/back are awesome and the colors bring out the albums feel. The photos in the cd booklet, the disc itself and the lyrics are awesome too...vintage Rush. A must have album. Enjoy!

B000H5TH1Q|5.0|I gather that the film was labeled 'misogynist' when it came out. Let's hope all that predictable chest-beating  has died down enough so that one can see the film for what it is -- a comic delight with unexpected and unaccountable moments of the sublime tossed in, for free, as it were. And yes it contains serious allusions to Vertigo side by side with trash, but that's its charm! Precisely because DePalma doesn't take himself too seriously (he goes out of his way to portray TWO film directors as total buffoons in this story) he is able to achieve, in collaboration with the composer, Pino Donaggio, aesthetic moments of a kind that others couldn't even conceive of let alone aspire to, because they would be trying so hard to be arty and \\"significant.\\" For example, the sound design and music for the scene leading up to the theft of Gloria's purse on the beach is especially beautiful, as though Claude Debussy on a whim had done an MTV video. And then there's DePalma's use of the popular song, \\"Relax\\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood (banned in the UK). I'm the kind of person who spends his commute time listening to the Berg Violin Concerto or comparing different recordings of Beethoven's late string quartets, but I have to admit that the \\"Relax\\" sequence as choreographed by DePalma in this film is comparable to any iconic moment you might care to point to in all of western classical music. Strange to say, but it's true. (Blame it on the unearthly beauty of Melanie Griffith's shoulder blades if you like...) If you have the slightest interest in or curiosity about this film, by all means buy the special edition -- excellent Special Features have been added.
078322740X|4.0|You might remember \\"The Out-of-Towners\\" and cringe when you see Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin in another movie.  (Though this one preceeded it by about a decade)  However, this one is actually quite cute.  I enjoyed the craftiness of Hawn's character while Martin's character tried to keep up with her.  I only gave it four stars because there is a moment or two where you might be slightly frustrated - but overall, an enjoyable movie with many funny moments.
B000RIWAVW|1.0|**This one-star review is based on the 2007 single disc release, not the movie itself.<br /><br />How pathetic- with the coming of the unnecessary remake of the cult slasher classic comes yet another DVD release of the original- yet not often do we see a new re-release actually downgrade itself from its predecessor.<br />The 2-Disc edition, which was released several years ago, runs laps around this \\"new, restored\\" version, and I can't even imagine what Ancor Bay is epecting us to do here. I mean, how stupid do they think we are?<br /><br />The 2-Disc version [[ASIN:B00009UW0N Halloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)]] is the DVD for you- not only does it contain the restored, widescreen presentation of Halloween, but it also contains an intruiging commentary track and several documentaries and featurettes.<br /><br />The new release has the movie. And that's all. Besdies a distorted full-screen option.<br /><br />To make a long story short: If you have the 2-Disc edition of Halloween, there is no need to buy this. If you don't have the 2-Disc edition, you should buy it.<br />Conclusuion: This product should make zero sales.
0694003611|5.0|A wonderful book, simple yet enchanting.  My children and I like to find the mouse in each picture of the room.  I remember this book from my childhood, and it's fun to share it with our children.
0743496728|4.0|I am not going to say I loved this book.  Only because this is a tough issue.  This work of fiction is so scary it is true.  Someone asked me if this is fiction.  I could not say it was fiction or non fiction.  Because this has happened.  There was a part of the book that said that the  teenager was as much as a victim as the children that were killed.      This was so close to home.  Because I am a parent of a 17 yr. old who is about to become a senior.  I am reading this right before the school year starts.  There is a part of the book that mentions the age of the children either 11 or 12 mentioning 9/11.  That is the same age as my son( how scary).    This book, has a lot to say.  Good discussion for book clubs.  This book should be reccommended reading for all teachers and students and auxillary workers at the schools.  To prevent bullying even at the age of pre-k.    My son was getting picked on all lot, til he finally fought back(how unfortunate)  to give this book to all the teacher's in the high schools.  It is not so much about the killing.  But, how do we prevent this.  There is two sides of the book.  The Bullying and tauting of the children.  And popularity of the teens.  They can't be themselves.  They are worried what their friends will think( there so called friends).  They mention all their friends are waiting for them to make a mistake so they will fall.  This book will be the sounding board of great debate.  Which happens in some of Jodi Picoult's books.  I have only read 2.  I did not like the ending.  I felt that the author wrote the ending for totally entertainment.  I had to remember this was fiction.  I still liked the book.  I hope she continues to write great books.  But, this was hard to read especially since I read this about 4 months after the VA Tech shooting.
B00000F214|5.0|This movie is a work of art. Astounding acting. Unexpectedly humorous. Twists more times than kite string. Not for the preoccupied or people with short attention spans. The kind of movie you can watch 3 times and still notice things that eluded you before. Richard Roeper, from the Ebert & Roeper tv show, said that David Mamet might be the best screen writer presently working.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Definitely a GREAT movie, Letters from Iwo Jima is Clint Eastwood's companion film to Flags of our Fathers and examines the Battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese.  General Tadamichi Kuribayashi arrives on Iwo Jima to see to the island's defenses prior to the American attack that is to follow.  While there, he will come across a wide spectrum of Japanese soldiers who are about to put their lives on the line for the defense of their families, their homeland, and their emperor.     Ken Watanabe and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% making this movie one of the best of its kind.  The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.    Balanced and fair, Letters from Iwo Jima is a movie about duty, honor, bravery, loyalty, inner strength, and the defeated side's heroes from a time long gone.   The battles, the costumes, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!    In conclusion, Letters from Iwo Jima is a film guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!
1579126278|5.0|This book was probably about the 15th Agatha Christie Novel I had read and since then I have read almost 15 more- but this remains my favorite. This novel truly reflects Christie's ability to decieve the reader and have you on the edge of your seat. I have many times recomended this book to first time Agathe Christie readers, and have only gotten postive feedback. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a true thriller from beginning to end.
1594489505|2.0|Compared to the Kite Runner, this novel feels less well developed and terribly predictable.  There are some insights into the Muslim culture and Afghanistan but the novel was lacking in real depth.  The pain and suffering of Mariam and Laila was contrived and seemed more like a literary technique rather than an integral and necessary part of the story.  On the whole the story was a bit underdone and boring.  I believe that many discerning readers with high expectations based upon the rich story line of the Kite Runner will be disappointed.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I bought this video at 5 months along, needing a good workout. Prior to becoming pregnant, I was an avid runner. Once pregnant, I turned to walking and it just wasn't giving me the heart-pumping workout I needed and got from a good run. I decided to give this video a try and LOVED it. The workout is done in her own living room, which is a welcomed change from the typical staged workout rooms. She moves quickly and doesn't spend a lot of time explaining every move, which I appreciated. You simply move from one exercise to the next, in order to keep your heart rate up. I have purchased several videos and always find myself bored with the instructor's lengthy explanations.     I recommend this video for anyone willing to accept a tough and challenging workout! You will sweat in no time and feel so much more strengthened and toned!

0618680004|2.0|After reading some of the other reviews here, and thinking I must be missing something, I have reread the book. But my assessment has not changed one bit, but only become stronger. Risking the hate email that surely will arise from a negative review of this book (who are the real fundamentalists?), I suggest that Dawkins should stick to his day job. Although he's a superb biologist when dealing with observable facts, he isn't a philosopher and he shouldn't play one in print. He doesn't seem to have the mind for it. Why? Because the philosophical mistakes that he makes in this book are so silly that one has to wonder what his editor was thinking (or drinking). What one finds are the jumps in logic that I would expect from someone like Shelby Spong trying to eliminate the miraculous or a high school freshman who is trying to dismiss religion to justify his binge drinking. And this gets to the heart of the problem of the book. It is mostly an emotional rant against Dawkins' concept of God, which I admit I do not believe in either. So don't get me wrong, I am not bashing his atheism (which is not logical in my view), just the oddly weak nature of his strawman arguments that only saw the light of printed day owing to his stature in his proper field of expertise, which is not theology or philosophy.<br /><br />Major example of silliness: Since the more complex a thing is the more unlikely it is to exist, God is most likely not there, since God would be hypercomplex. But this proves nothing and doesn't even follow logic. Of course any idea or concept of God will include the \\"beyond beyond\\" apophatic category, but isn't that logical and doesn't it allow for the simplicity of God at the same time? Both arguments are circular, but his is the diameter of a basketball hoop. It holds very little grey matter. Moreover, it assumes God must be complex. That is just his prejudiced assumption. God doesn't have to be complex. In fact, it is just as logical or not to assume divine simplicity. Look at the Western Theological Tradition with people like Aquinas or Augustine, i.e., real philosopher. Divine simplicity is part of the package for them. Or, to put it plainly, he is applying biological ideas and categories wrongly to the divine, which last time I checked no theologian of the Christian tradition ever does. Why not? Because it doesn't make sense to speak of God as just the most complex creature in the universe, just the biggest kid on the block. That would be changing what Christians, Dawkins' main object of ridicule, mean by the term \\"God\\". But that is what little kids (and Dawkins) think about God, not philosophers and theologians (or hopefully adults). And it's sad his editor didn't ask him, \\"Uh, Rich, you never proved your premise. Not even attempted to prove it.\\" Again, poor logic. At any rate I am not sure that theists need to even speak of the probability of God existing. It is not probable for God to exist; but that aside, his confusion of probability with impossibility is unwarranted and a basic redefining of the terms.  I can guess that he doesn't believe in the possibility of eleven-sided triangles, but whatever.<br /><br />A further example of silliness is his idea that evolution writ large, especially neurological evolution, disproves God since it is random, and thus unlikely. But how so? It only disproves a particular type of literalist fundamentalism, which even most Christians in the past rejected anyway. From very early on, Christians at least (I am thinking of Basil and Macrina in the fourth century, among many others) have said that God does what God does, and if science shows how it is done, great, but it never can answer the \\"why\\" behind the purpose. That is a purely philosophical question. And something's being unlikely doesn't disprove its existence, only its unlikely existence. That is a huge distinction and it is just, if not more, supportive of theism's claims about creation. But again, Dawkins is dismissing a childish view of God and claiming he dismissed the Great Tradition. Simply strawman silliness that people get duped by, since it reinforces their own atheistic fundamentalism. Can't we have open, logical minds? Richard Dawkins, or at least his editor, should have actually read some theology or philosophy before writing the book. It would have made his arguments stronger and my review shorter. Again, it is simply astounding to read how much faith Dawkins puts in the god of Chance. The role of chance once the universe is created is reduced (to odds that are still much larger than he admits), but his premise of a one in a billion chance of DNA to arise is way too optimistic by hundreds of trillions and would require way more than the 13-odd billion years the universe has existed. And no matter how we understand the process of evolution, it is simply an article of faith to say that no god created whatever it is at the beginning. This is where Dawkins own god of the gaps enters in: chance. For him, anything is possible, even the impossible, except for the existence of God, since he uses a very gigantic and unwarranted understanding of the idea of chance, which is NOT a cause of anything, to replace the reality of god. But he offers absolutely no logical basis for the belief. None whatsoever. He should at least be an agnostic if he followed logic and not bias.  (Oh yes, atheists have faith.)<br /><br />And finally, although this is perhaps being petty, the cover speaks more than it perhaps may have intended. You will notice that his name is what you really notice before the title. This is so true. The book is about his half-formed and ill-willed rants more than it is about anyone's supposed delusions. Were it not for the seriousness of the subject, this book would be a sad, but somewhat humorous, tale.<br /><br />Please see these for better arguments for and against religion: [[ASIN:0872203433 Does God Exist?: A Dialogue]], [[ASIN:080284491X The Restitution of Man: C.

0385522401|5.0|This work is most meaningful to me if viewed in the classic novella form. The story concentrates on a single action (the wedding night), arouses suspense (will the marriage be consummated), and contains an element of surprise leading to an unexpected ending.  The element of surprise exposes new levels of reality (novella=new) that can seem to be inexplicable or not fully understood by the protagonists.      The newlyweds, Florence and Edward, are British; the time is 1962, two years after the unexpurgated version of Lady Chatterley's Lover was published in London.  She is a violinist from an upper class family who are rather emotionally impoverished people.  Classical music has become her whole life, and it would seem that into this avenue, she has also divereted all her sexual energy.  Edward, eagerly hoping to escape his somewhat lower class background, has just received a degree from University College.    Even though Florence and Edward live at a time \\"when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible,\\" McEwan says, \\"it is never easy.\\"  So, the reader is left to ponder how deeply is sexuality integrated into personality, and how deeply does culture and historical period affect sexuality.  The story obviously would not have the same impact if set in the 21st century, but the novella form prevents detailed analysis.  Thus, some readers may be disappointed with the ending or find the couple abnormal.      Despite its brevity and simplicity, On Chesil Beach is not an effortless read, but it is beautifully written and a fine, sensitive piece of literature.  I loved this book.

B000002KKC|3.0|There was an inordinate amount of pressure on Fleetwood Mac in the late 1970's.  Their previous album, \\"Rumours\\", was one of the biggest albums in rock history, and the album before it, \\"Fleetwood Mac\\", had aged well in the hearts of a suddenly huge legion of fans.  Facing huge touring demands and the pressure to deliver another timeless album, the band elected to produce a double album, with the hope of creating another commercial juggernaut.  It didn't work out that way; but it wasn't for a lack of effort at all.  There were at least 8 really good songs on this album, but the rest - particularly on the second disk - didn't leave any lasting impression.  And the marketing ideas weren't real good either - the choice of \\"Tusk\\" as the first single was questionable, although it's not a bad song; but the second single, Stevie Nicks' wonderful \\"Sara\\", would have been a much better choice.  And how Lindsay Buckingham's terrific \\"What Makes You Think You're The One\\" was not a single is beyond me. All of the three top 10 singles are worth the price of admission (The third single was Christine McVie's \\"Think About Me\\"); the fourth single, which didn't fare very well, was Stevie's \\"Sisters Of The Moon\\", a moody, dark song in the vein of \\"Gold Dust Woman\\".  Buckingham's energetic \\"The Ledge\\" and rollicking \\"Not That Funny\\" are also worth a listen, as is McVie's \\"Over And Over\\". If the Mac had stopped recording after the first disk, they probably would have sold more copies of \\"Tusk\\" - because essentially everything memorable about this set is on that disk.

B000N4SHOE|4.0|\\"Miss Potter\\" explores the private life and inner world of Beatrix Potter, creator of Peter Rabbit and his anthropomorphized friends and author of so many beloved children's books, by focusing on the most dramatic period of the author's life. Having refused the parade of suitors her parents chose for her, Beatrix Potter (Renee Zellweger) finds herself still an unmarried woman in her 30s. Seemingly resigned to spinsterhood, Beatrix dedicates her energies to her artwork. In 1902, she makes the rounds of London publishers with a small illustrated children's volume called \\"Peter Rabbit\\". It is to her most pleasant surprise that F. Warne & Company finally consents to publish her book. Norman Warne (Ewan McGregor) has been pestering his older brothers for a place in the family business, and this little volume with low expectations is deemed just the project for him. But Norman finds Peter Rabbit and his author utterly charming and is determined to make them a success.<br /><br />\\"Miss Potter\\" presents Beatrix Potter's dilemma as that of a modern-minded woman forced to cope with Victorian expectations. She won't marry someone she doesn't like in order to advance her mother's social ambitions. She doesn't see why she can't make something of herself without a husband. I'm wary of instilling a person from the 19th century with late-20th century values and motives, but there is no denying that Beatrix Potter was very independent. At this point in her life, her personal and professional ambitions clashed with her society, in the form of her class-conscious, critical mother (Barbara Flynn). Some viewers may be disappointed that this film does not address Beatrix Potter's artistic background or her accomplishments as a natural history painter. But it does show us the satisfaction and pain she experienced as she transformed from eccentric spinster into the wealthy, famous, and accomplished author and conservationist that history remembers.<br /><br />The DVD (Weinstein 2007): There are 2 featurettes, a theatrical trailer, a music video for \\"When You Taught Me How to Dance\\" performed by Katie Melua, and an audio commentary. \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Beatrix Potter\\" (20 min) is a British documentary about the legacy of Peter Rabbit and the life of its author.

The movie stands on its own and is also the introduction to the Stargate cable/television series.<br /><br />As a father of five sons, I have enjoyed sharing this one with each boy when he reaches 7 or 8 (on a smallish screen but with big sound).<br /><br />I would warn all families away from the pilot episode for the first year's series ([[ASIN:B000IBUH4U Stargate SG-1]]), due to gratuitous nudity and overly graphic display of the Goa'uld larvae habits...  Have the kiddos skip the pilot.  The series however is hilarious, and reasonably wholesome considering it started on cable. It is somewhat skit style, with actors stepping out of character and poking fun at almost every sci-fi movie ever made (including itself).
B000002H2H|5.0|This is metalicas best album ride the lightning 1983. joe fleckenstein here to tell you all about my love for metalica. my love for metalica actauly started with and justice for all. i heard the song one and after playing that classic about 200 times i decided i needed more metalica. so i imediatly purchased master of puppets and ride the lightning. released november 16 1983 lightning was a bold and remarkable step for the band. T heir first album was ok but had no singing and no musical definition. lightning has great melody inspired by the sound of classical music which i love. but lightning is by no means soft it hits hard. these eight songs are all powered by fury and anguish yet some have very pretty melodys. the album masterfully combines mellow intergradable musical harmonies while offering the furious cuthroat tone of traditionial thrash metal. Ride the lightning is a classic metal song and features a wonderful guitar solo. for whom the bell tolls and fade to black are the greatest one two punch on any album. and creeping death is my favirote metal song ever. hate metal listen to call of ktulu- it combines classically influenced music with the hardhitting sound of the best rock music. The point im trying to drive home here is if you arent already a metal fan Ride the lightning will make you one. its the ultimate metal alum and if youre looking for an excuse to get into metal youve found one.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I waited for so many years for a Linkin park studio album after Meteora and was left totally disappointed.I have been a great fan of LP since their Hybrid theory days, but what I heard from Minutes to midnight sounded like most of the Boybands and left me utterly confused.  It sounded like a mixture of all the bands like Backstreet boys, N sync, a little dose of Red hot chilli peppers, Bon Jovi...etc.I hope they go back to where they started from otherwise they,ll end up loosing a lot of FANS.....
B000002UAU|1.0|how nerdy is this band. here you will get some of the worst songs ever created. sgt pepper lonely hearts club band is a terrible song as is the rest of the album. only recomended if you have bad taste in music ie rap linkin park or backstreet boys type garbage. not even worth the 1 star amazon forces me to give it. singed joe fleck.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Loved the movie but was not impressed with the ending.  Guess they wanted a feel good for those who wanted to see the criminal put away.  Great movie though overall.
B000002JOH|5.0|Panteras vulgar display of power is brutal. its my favirote metal album besides metalicas ride the lightning. This music is iteligent deft and very heavy. lets go to the breakdowns. mouth for war- has the most recongizable riff ever. solid vocals and one of dimebags best solos. 10-10. a new level- i gotta tell you first time i heard it i didnt like it. its really grown on me. another solid track 8-10. walk- my favirote pantera song the most classic riff and solo of pantera are included in this song. plus an unforgetable vocal delivery by phil anselmo. 10-10. fin hostile- this song is fast and rasor sharp. the cuthroat vocals are only matched by the qaulity of the guitar work. 9-10. this love- its one of panteras slower songs but still brutally heavy 7-10. rise- what can i say? awesome 100 times. lightning fast. great main riff. a great solo and a terrific vocal delivery. HATE THIS HATE ME HATE THIS RIGHT APPROACH FOR THE WRONG. 10-10. no god- eh its ok 6-10. regular people eh its ok 6-10. by demons be driven- great song more than worthy of the pantera name beautifal vocals excellent main riff and even a good very weird sounding solo. 9-10. this love- i listen to this song everyday its great 11-10. i cant even express how much i love this album it is so good. its rare to find an album where 80 percent of the music is awesome. there are ten songs here only 2 are filler. if you dont have this album i recomend you buy it immediatly.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|I'm an original die-hard Beatles fan, grew up with them in the 60s; I still think that The Beatles are the most innovative and age-defining band of the Rock and Roll era.  No other band had such creativity and diversity in their sound throughout their short but timeless successful career.  I had all of their original vinyl albums, cassettes and now all of their CDs<br /><br />This \\"Love\\" album manages to take true classic Beatles music, needlessly create medlies and mix together random soundtracks to make a true mockery of their creative music genius.  I cringed while listening to this truely aweful CD except when the mucic was recognizable as the original music.  If this is what the future holds for new Beatles releases, then I will never buy another Beatles album again, unless it's to replace a missing or damaged classic.<br /><br />If you don't know what F.U.B.A.R. means, ask any military veteran.
B00008H2LB|1.0|joe fleckenstein here to give you my opion about this posotively awful album. first of all im not a linkin park fan THANK GOD! just someone who had to endure the pain of listening to his friend eugene talk about how great this band is. well theyre not. The singer is whiny and irritating. the guitar work is atricious and nothing else is of special intrest either. Absolutely terrible and if you think otherwise youve never heard good music. might i suggest metalica. led zepplin. pantera. slayer. queen etc.
B000R3QZ2C|4.0|The most famous Haydn recorded by the Berlin Phil. was under Furtwangler and Karajan, neither of  whom came within a mile of being Historically Informed. Here Rattle goes for total HIP-ness, employing fleet tempos, small forces, and no vibrato in the strings.  In this outing he goes a few steps farther than his semi-period-style Beethoven cycle. There, his biggest successes came in the two earliest symphonies, so it's no wonder that he finds Haydn congenial, and one must admit that Haydn's symphonies take more naturally to period styling.<br /><br />The only named symphony here is the 'Oxford,' No. 92, although Sym. #88 is equally popular.  For many youger listeners No. 89-91 may come as entirely new, and to encourage buyers EMI offers a great two-for-one bargain. If you want to hear Haydn in HIP style from world-class musicians, here's your chance. There's no doubt that the Berliners play exquisitely, and for that reason alone Rattle's reading of the wonderful Sinfonia Concertante ranks close to the top of the list.  There is a hint of timidity in the interpretation, however.<br /><br />I feel a little guilty not giving this delightful set five stars, because my reservations are intangible.  It's not enough to say that the minuets shouldn't be taken super-fast, basically as Scherzos without a hint of court dance. But Rattle makes everything so fizzy and bright that I don't find enough relaxation, much less tenderness; he doesn't leave space for this music to be loved.  Many listeners may not agree, and if you want exhiliration above all else, you shouldn't hesitate to buy this new set. God knows it's getting harder and harder to hear Haydn's music in the concert hall.
B000062YAZ|4.0|slayer is awesome. they meld the complex guitar work of bands likme metalica and pantera with suprizingly hateful vocals. reign in blood is probally my favirote slayer song. but angel of death is good and so is the rest of the album. very highly recomended.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin, of course, has become one of the all time most influential bands in the history of rock music.  They remain popular today more than 20 years after their final album.  With \\"II\\" the band really came into their own as songwriters and recording artists.  The band's first album was filled with blues covers and their unique take on late 60's heavy rock.  It was a stirring debut, but would only serve as the blueprint for the albums that would follow.  On \\"Zep II\\" Jimmy Page becomes the king of the big sounding guitar riff.  The album is a mix of heavy blues, hard rock and acoustic folk tinged songs that show off all of the best elements of the band.  Drummer John Bonham even includes a throbbing drum solo in \\"Moby Dick\\".  The songs on this album are pretty much all classics from the opening \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" to the finale of \\"Bring It On Home\\".  Many Zeppelin fans cite this album as the band's all time best.  For me there are other albums that I liked better, but there is no doubt that this one is one of the classic albums of the 60's.
B000002H33|5.0|metalicas 3rd album master of puppets 1986. 1986 was all about metal iron maiden judas priest and slayer were releasing albums a dime a dozen but none of those could touch this magmum opus. Many people consider master of puppets the best metal album ever and even though i personally am trying to decide between ride the lightning and and justice for all for my favirote metalica album. theres no doubt that puppets is a bigger more original and much more complex album than both of those. its stirring. melodic. crushing and powerful. but i still do like lightning and justice better. now lets go to the song by song breakdowns. battery- starts with a flamenco guitar intro. which quickly turns into pulverizing rock not a high point but ok 5-10. master of puppets 10-10- what can i say? this song is awesome. fast as hell. excellent main riff. a beautifal classicaly inspired passage. a mindblowing solo before going raw again this song has it all. The thing that should not be 2-10- terrible skip it. welcome home sanitarium 8-10- chilling in the truest sense of the word. has a very pretty melody and very mellow guitar work before going nuts with thrash metal mayhem another highlight. Disposable heroes 10-10- a vastly underated song. extremely fast precise guitar playing. awesome as hell lyrics and vocals. plus a grand guitar solo which all culminates in a terrific ending one of metalicas very best songs. leper messiah- good guitar solo and some good guitar work 7-10. orion instrumental 10-10- wow this is the best instrumental ever even better than call of ktulu from lightning. beautifal classicaly inspired arangements. breathtaking passages. a good guitar solo. some whammy bar action and jimi hendrix esque guitar work at the end. damage inc 10-10- best song on the album! all in all puppets is a great album if you dont own it put an end to your misery.
B000002J09|5.0|The album that contains what many believe to be the greatest rock n roll song of all time \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", \\"IV\\" is another classic Zeppelin disc that is absolutely solid from start to finish.  This album was where Zeppelin graduated from the biggest rock band in the world to true rock gods.  There is not a bad song on the disc, and not a single track that has not received at least some radio airplay over the years.  \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Rock And Roll\\", \\"Battle Of Evermore\\", \\"Stairway\\", \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", \\"Four Sticks\\", \\"Going To California\\", \\"When The Levee Breaks\\", man they are all great.  Even though I have heard \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" a million times over the years, I still find myself banging my head to Page's guitar solo in the big finale.  Yes, it deserves to be one of the most celebrated rock songs of all time.  70's rock did not get much better than this, and many of these tracks are still relevant today.
B000002H97|5.0|many people say metalica sold out with this album. thats partially true. but giving this a good listen its not a bad album at all in fact its excellent. enter sandman and nothing else matters are two metal classics. sad but true is as heavy as damage inc. the unforgiven is an enjoyable listen. and the god that failed and the struggle within are good as well. so while half the album is forgetable filler. the other halif is required listening. so if youre wondering if you should get the black album i say GO FOR IT. The music you will hear here will be well worth it. the brawny guitar solos. beautifal singing stiring melody and great songwriting all add up to a classic metalica album.
B000002JSN|4.0|This two disc set was released smack dab in the middle of the decade of the 70's.  The album is a tour de force where the band pulled out all the stops covering just about every musical style in their repertoire.  For me the album is rather inconsistent.  Some of the tracks here were leftovers from sessions from earlier albums and in some cases it is easy to see why they were left off.  This is the first Zep album where there seems to be some filler here and there.  None of it is bad, but all of the material here is not necessarily up to the standards of the albums that came before.  That being said the album does contain some all time Zeppelin classics.  \\"Kashmir\\" is the albums highlight and a staple of classic rock radio to this day.  \\"Custard Pie\\", \\"In My Time Of Dying\\", \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" are all great as well.  Overall I think if this album had been paired down to a single disc it could have been another great Zeppelin outing, but as it is the album remains just a good effort from the band.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|Why bother writing a review for this movie.    It was slow, boring, anti-climatic, and dull.  Took way to long to really get anywhere; and once you finally get there....ehhhh.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|To start off I would actually give this album 3.5 stars as I believe a 4 star album would be on the level of Countdown but a 3 star would be on the level of The System has Failed. I believe this album falls in between. I do not review too many albums but being a huge Megadeth fan I figured I would chime in. I own most of the Megadeth catalog with the exception of a couple albums.  It seems to be a common trend to compare every album a band produces with their finest efforts.  There will not be another Rust in Peace,  Peace Sells,  or Countdown to Extinction.  To compare every album to these is unfair as the mentioned albums could easily be considered masterpieces of metal. Given that, I definitely think this is the best offering since Countdown.  There are a couple songs, most notably Gears of War, that I think had potential but in the end came out stale.  That does not take away from the fact that this is a solid album. The style of UA is catchy enough to attract the casual audience but still contains enough crunching riffs and excellent solos to please the longtime Megadeth fans. I will not go into detail on every song as there are plenty of other reviews that do that already.  On a side note I thought the System has Failed was the bands return to their roots and a very solid effort, but I also think that UA surpasses it in every aspect.  Mustaine does voice his political opinion more than ever in this album, but when I listen to a Megadeth album lyrics are the last thing that concern me.
0060763892|4.0|A good way to spend a few hours, but it does borrow some of the same plot rationales from \\"The Black Order,\\" and has more than a few manufactured turns of events.
0307346609|5.0|A China-originating epidemics that turns human beings into lethal walking deads has striken humanity. Completely overwhelmed by the sheer mass of the enemy, mankind falls back everywhere, using whatever weapons or defensive strategies to preserve itself against the seemingly invincible threat. WWZ is basically the global, worldwide, bird's eye view of an \\"end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it\\" tale, transmitted to the reader via the subtle approach of a post-events journalist who interviews various survivors of these cataclysmic times.<br /><br />Before I move on into the praise of the book, I need to underline what seems to me as perhaps the only weakness of this book: although each of the survivors does bring its little stone to the building, serving the purpose of the author into bringing our attention onto one of his specific bits of criticism about mankind, the accumulation of these numerous testimonies may come a bit as a drag on the reader's pace through the book. I remember having gone through a period of reading when I could only read three or four testimonies in the same evening, before carrying on the following day. It was not because the book lacked interest at all, it was rather the exact opposite: at times, the book's contents were so rich that I needed to slow down my reading to a trickle of pages to fully absorb what Brooks had to  say...<br /><br />The book is littered with fabulous, highly creative ideas: zombies roaming the bottom of the oceans, the unique tactics employed by emerging nations to fight the enemy (like India, Iran), the short-sightedness of the army brass in facing the herds of living-deads with conventional weapons and forgetting, in their hastiness, to properly work out the layout and the retreat scheme of their own forces, the unsuspected help of winter in defeating the zombies, the role of trivial drugs merchandising in winning the war (according to the waste of humanity that's interviewed!), the hell of the boats when they get overwhelmed by the plague... Everything seems to indicate that the author not only loved his project, but also put a lot of creativity and coherence into his work. There is hardly any incoherence worth mentioning in it. One of my favorite passages -being in aviation, that is!- is about the whereabouts of this female pilot which Herc crashes in the middle of hostile territory: thrilling!<br /><br />In WWZ, as in other top notch fiction books, what makes it such a remarkable work is that it offers a double layer of appreciation: action level, reflection level. While WWZ might not necessarily offer that much of the first to the avid gore fans out there, the second is addressed in a simply exceptional way. Marketing, capitalism, ethnic diversity, family and social bonds, insignificance and superficiality of the opposition between developed and developing nations in times of paramount crisis, vacuum of the showbiz way of life: just pick up a hot social topic, and you can almost be sure it will get addressed somewhere in Brooks' WWZ book.<br /><br />Heads down, chaps, this is a brilliant piece of work! Who said that horror was a minor literature genre???ue... Everything seems to indicate that the author not only loved his project, but also put a lot of creativity and coherence into his work.

B000QUCNOK|4.0|This is definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.  Not having read the book, I had no basis from which to judge it before seeing it for the first time on DVD.  And now, having seen it, I have to admit that I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about the thing.  It's just . . . so strange.<br /><br />Good things first: I found the imagery in the film to be quite arresting.  The colors were lush and vibrant, really bounding off the screen at you.  And the art direction was superb.  As other reviewers have attested, you really can almost *smell* this movie.  It's one of the few period pieces I've seen where everyone looks appropriately dirty, as if they could use a nice soapy shower.  I enjoyed the narration and all of the performances.  Alan Rickman was especially marvelous, and the main character, played by Ben Whishaw (an actor apparently more famous for the stage than anything else . . . for now) was perfectly cast.  He was creepy, yet somehow strangely alluring. In spite of myself, I managed to build up some empathy for him, though he is one of the creepiest film characters I've ever seen.<br /><br />The drawbacks of the movie are not necessarily drawbacks.  They just come so far out of left field that it's difficult to really step back and judge them at this point, when I am still recovering from shock.  Let's just say that *SPOILER ALERT!!* I've never seen a movie that contains both a massive orgy AND cannibalism.  Who'da thunk it?  There are also several things in the movie that are not really explained and don't make a whole lot of sense, such as the glowing light that emanates from a room after a key murder, and the trail of death the lead character (inadvertently?) leaves behind him.<br /><br />On the whole, this movie should be seen, if only to be believed.  One of the people I was watching with left for nearly an hour to take a phone call, and when she came back and we told her what she'd missed, she was dubious, to say the least.  It's definitely something you have to stick with, despite its often bizarre and intensely creepy twists.  I settled on four stars because overall, I DID like the movie . . . I'm just not sure how much!stick with, despite its often bizarre and intensely creepy twists.  I settled on four stars because overall, I DID like the movie . . . I'm just not sure how much!
6305428042|5.0|This is a movie that never gets old.  It is classic comedy, up there with some of the old greats.  Every time I watch it I have to laugh...and when people are younger they don't get or understand that adult jokes and than when they get older it's like watching a movie for the first time.  I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B00005ASOI|4.0|Dario Argento is the German version of Alfred Hitchcock.  *Suspiria* is one of the best horror/thriller films that I've seen, even though it was made in the 70's.<br /><br />Susy is a young American dancer who has flown to Germany to attend one of the best ballet schools in the world.  Upon arrival in a dark stormy night, Susy immediately faces drama at the door.  A young woman opens the front door and shouts something back and disappears...only to be murdered later.<br /><br />Almost right at the beginning, Susy doesn't feel right at the school.  She's fainting, getting nosebleeds and hearing strange noises outside her room.  She isn't the only one...another dancer hears them as well.<br /><br />All of this is building up for a surprise ending.  If you really pay attention throughout the movie, you could probably guess what the surprise is.<br /><br />I love the props, especially the wallpapers, and the lighting throughout the movie.  They were really eye catching.  I have a feeling that the wallpapers inspired *Lucky Number Slevin* because the same thing is seen in this movie.<br /><br />Anyways, I liked *Suspiria* even though some parts can be a little corny.  Nonetheless, it's entertaining.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie was truly sensational. The ideas are not completely new, but then again, there is virtually no originality left in the world. What was new was how is was presented and the cast of actors. It is a distinguished blend of fine acting, moving slow scenes, and stylized action. The Gun Katas is a very cool concept...many of the gun sequences and the one sword sequence are extremely well done, and though the hall scene leading up to Fathers office is extremely reminiscent of The Matrix, the fight is so stylized and extreme you just enjoy it rather than criticize. The grittiness of the world is perfectly matched by the cool, sterile offices, the slicked hair of the Grammaton Clerics and the buttoned coats they wear, along with the monotone colors present throughout, unless when dealing in the Underground. The movie is superbly acted,the action scenes incredibly choreographed,and twists and turns are very enjoyable. The dialogue, though quiet at times, is always worth paying attention to. The whole film smacks of a artistically-done drama, yet is not that at all because of the fantastic action sequences which are seamlessly worked into the fil. Highly recommended to any moviegoer, whether they are a fan of futuristic sci-fi, action, drama, even philosophy. Fantastic film, 5 stars hands down.
B000NA2776|5.0|I dismissed this at first because I thought it was too close in content and feel to the Scissor Sisters new release, which was equally bright and poppy, but ultimately disappointing. Mika however avoids the same pifalls of SS. The falsetto is soul-souring rather than annoying, the silly little pop-songs are actually more complex and have more staying power than initial listen would suggest. In short this is perfect pop. 'Grace Kelly' is the obvious knock-out, but there are strong followups in 'Love Today', the very Freddy Mercuryesque 'Big Girl' and my favourite 'Take It Easy'. The influences of Robby Williams, Queen and Scissor Sisters, (even a bit of George Michael on 'Happy Ending')  are maybe too close for comfort, but Mika ultimately transcends these and soars into a stratosphere of his own. Play it now, and play it hard, before you hate it next year...

B000Q6GUTI|2.0|Bobby Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg, [[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed]]) is a disgruntled vet. Ultimately left for dead on a sniper mission toward the end of his career, Bobby survives while his spotter-partner \\"takes one for America.\\"<br /><br />Several years later we find Swagger living a life of self-imposed exile in the Colorado Rockies, his only friend a mutt who guards him and his home. He has no plans to re-enter society until...<br /><br />Enter Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover, [[ASIN:B000S0DDG0 Dreamgirls]]), a \\"patriot\\" who claims that the life of the President of the United States is in danger. Knowing Swagger's history and his righteous defense of everything American, Johnson approaches the sniper-extraordinaire with a proposition: help them find out how an attempt on the President will take place and thus they can defuse it.<br /><br />Come to find out, Johnson isn't working for the President at all and is in the pocket of a U.S. Senator named Charles Meachum (Ned Beatty). Their plan isn't to kill the Prez but to eliminate another threat that stands near him during a speech in St. Louis (naturally money is involved).<br /><br />Having utilized Swagger, the Colonel attempts to off him but fails, much to the chagrin of Senator Meachum.<br /><br />Swagger is now on the run, wounded and bleeding, his face plastered on every television screen claiming he attempted to kill the President. Knowing that he has to get away no matter what, Swagger runs afoul of Secret Service agent named Nick Memphis (Michael Pena, [[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash]]). Hobbling him in quick, military fashion, Agent Memphis is just \\"glad to be alive.\\" Which brought up a unique question: Why didn't the sniper just kill him? This drives Agent Memphis to make some terrible discoveries about his boss, his job, and what America values most.<br /><br />Double-crossed for the last time, Swagger seeks out those who framed him and uses his sniper training to ultimate advantage. Anyone less than 1,000 yards away is surely in trouble now. He even eventually brings Agent Memphis into his fold and teaches him the fine art of Sniperdom.<br /><br />SHOOTER's details are more interesting than the whole, as are the DVD special features. How a shooter positions himself. The effects on his shot from weather and wind to the curvature of the Earth are brought into play, making the mechanics more fascinating than the story.<br /><br />There's also the fact that some HUGE holes develop later on. Swagger nearly gets killed, then suddenly BANG! we're somewhere else where he can eliminate a threat to himself. There's no rhyme or reason to this showing that director Fuqua needed a little help come editing time. And then (drum roll) the big problem: Swagger is in custody and then, without clear reason, he's set free. The ridiculousness of this event is mind-boggling, even while watching a fictitious film where one must suspend disbelief.<br /><br />This film might appeal to military types who like to watch long shots being made at moving targets, but other than that, it's probably a safe pass.eventually brings Agent Memphis into his fold and teaches him the fine art of Sniperdom.

There's also the fact that some HUGE holes develop later on. Swagger nearly gets killed, then suddenly BANG! we're somewhere else where he can eliminate a threat to himself. There's no rhyme or reason to this showing that director Fuqua needed a little help come editing time. And then (drum roll) the big problem: Swagger is in custody and then, without clear reason, he's set free. The ridiculousness of this event is mind-boggling, even while watching a fictitious film where one must suspend disbelief.     This film might appeal to military types who like to watch long shots being made at moving targets, but other than that, it's probably a safe pass.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I've been a fan of D12 ever since I been interested in hiphop music. Their two albums (Devils Night and D12 World) are both great albums. I've got 'em. My favorite one is D12 World with songs like \\"Loyalty\\" feat. Obie Trice, \\"My Band\\", \\"Leave Dat Boy Alone\\", \\"40oz\\", \\"6 In The Morning\\", \\"Git Up\\", \\"How Come\\", \\"Get My Gun\\", \\"Good Die Young\\", \\"American Psycho II\\" feat. B-Real. The other songs are good too. There's also a bonus track called \\"Keep Talkin\\". If you like gangsta hiphop music you'll like D12 World. I'm gonna be in line for the third D12 album when it comes out. Hope it's just as good as D12 World even though their friend and fellow rapper Proof died which isn't good. But I read that a third D12 album is still in the works though.
0812975219|4.0|Just when you think you can spot a trend, for example in the market, along comes this book to show how much is still left to chance and is unpredictable by your system. Sometimes overwritten, but gives illustrations that are worth considering.
1594489505|5.0|The author strikes gold again with another riveting tale of life and friendship and indeed the resilience of the human spirit against overwhelming odds.  Absolutely marvellous weaving of a story of the hard and tragic lives of two women in Afghanistan. Take a bow Mr. Hosseini and be assured that if you keep on churning out novels of this calibre your fans will keep on buying them.
B000R9J3X4|5.0|Whenever an artist brings out a retrospective, longtime fans are destined to make complaints. But it needs casual fans in mind and the general consensus and the public's familiarity is mostly in the group's first two records. I don't disagree that the later work was great, but as far as the music that's inside here it's definitely five-star material.    For die hards, \\"#1 Crush\\" and \\"The World Is Not Enough,\\" some excellent singles, are available on a Garbage album for the first time. Also, there's a completely new track on here called \\"Tell Me Where It Hurts\\" which is excellent, recommended to fans of the new-wave-y tracks.    The production here updates things from the cassette-quality production of the shoegaze-style debut album. There's 18 tracks and none of 'em are bad ones, not even just \\"merely good\\" ones. It's in chronologic order which is a plus for me. Most of the U.S. singles are included here, except the Beautiful Garbage ones. I too would have liked \\"Androgyny\\" and it seemed like on a local radio station that \\"Breaking Up the Girl\\" was a pretty well sized hit, but I guess with Shirley's dis-approval of the latter track and to include things on just one disc they decided to put in favor the bouncy \\"Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!)\\" and the mostly spoken techno rock standard \\"Shut Your Mouth.\\"    The remix disc is a nice bonus and does not make a much higher price than the single disc version. Some of it is not interesting and I'm generally not a big remix fan but it can be an entertaining listen and is a nice bonus to the collection. About my only complaint is a re-recorded \\"It's All Over But the Crying,\\" which was fine enough as it was seems like they just put louder percussion to make it more streamlined or something.    If you're new to Garbage, this is a perfect start. And going from there, there's only four albums so it's not like you're putting much of a budget to throw on these CD's.
1400079179|4.0|This book was indeed a fun read and I enjoyed some of the twists in plot that were not expected.  The development of a relationship between two of the main characters seemed forced and a bit shallow, to be honest - and this was my only real disappointment with it.  The overal story was fascinating and intellectually thrilling, although it has left me with the need to dig further to find out how much was fact and how much was fiction!  I suppose in that case, it can be called educational - by prompting more research!
B000ILYYJE|5.0|I enjoyed the re-mastering and sound.<br />The DVDs are far superior to the CDs especially the bass sounds.<br />The bonus tracks are good but there could have been a few more added to the DVDs as there are a few tracks I did not see such as Rock and Roll Is Dead.<br />The packaging is a bit strange. Huge box for the discs, waste of space. There also could have been more info on the recording sessions and re-mixing process.<br /><br />Well worth getting if you are a fan of the doors.
B000OPOANE|5.0|Rush continues to surprise, it's a musical slap-up meal (or whatever that means), i also liked the video inside the MVI, it's awesome...  \\"We could be down and gone, but we hold on\\"
0060558121|4.0|It's possible that being aware of the no. of awards heaped upon any work is the worst prejudice that one may have against that particular work. At least that's the way I felt about \\"American Gods\\", a strange and disturbing novel that forces one to rethink everything, and yet that somehow made me feel rather depressed once the experience was over. Maybe, had I read the book as just a 'book' and hadn't expected fireworks, my disappointment would have been replaced by stunning exhileration. One may raise several points against \\"American Gods\\", but the way it can make the reader examine apparently mundane things and persona in search of some 'divinity' in them is amazing. Read the book, think about it, enjoy it, but please don't think about the no. of awards it has won.
2070360024|2.0|The language in this short novel is simple and engaging, and probably the best (if not only) reason to read this book, particularly for students of french such as myself.    Unfortunately the story is very contrived and unconvincing, despite Camus' apparent attempts to ground it in a believable, ordinary world. The problem (as I see it) is that Mersault is easily Camus' least interesting protagonist, and the entire story is told in first person from his perspective. Mersault feels nothing and thinks nothing throughout the narrative, so that the narration gives the reader an intimate view of... nothing. Admittedly, previous and subsequent authors have dealt quite thoroughly with the thoughts and feelings of human characters in somewhat analogous situations to that of Mersault. Perhaps Camus was consciously treading new ground by placing his protagonist in what would be trying and difficult situations if only he cared about anything, but he doesn't, so they aren't.    There is plenty of good Camus out there, particularly his short stories and plays, but this is not it.
B000K15VSA|4.0|As HOT as I am to get my hands on the 5 disc package. I'm getting a little nervous about the gift that Vangelis gave to this incredible piece of art. Nothing given about a possible separate audio track for his music that he truly gave his heart and his soul to. Nothing listed in the documentaries/ alternate features of BR. Was he interviewed for it? Or was he ever interviewed about his luminous score over the 25 years since the films release? With the multitude of tracks available on dvd I'll be PISSED if the five different versions do not contain a single isolated Vangelis track. His score is equally as legend as the film itself.     I'm a fan of both BR and Vangelis. The fans of the Greek Gods' compositions over the years since BR have had an undying will of force to track down anything remotely related to his blissful score layered in rich atmosphere. Like those mysterious alternate soundtracks that used to be found on Ebay until a few years ago. The Gongo release is the second best one other than the 12 year delayed original version by Vangelis, which was released by Warner music.     Warner Bros. has been proudly proclaiming that they have all the rights issues handled to release this the way the filmmakers wanted it. Since they have the film and the score why haven't they included his participation in the upcoming notes? Maybe the fans STILL won't be able to enjoy All These Moments all in one place.
B00005JPLW|4.0|In the end this movie is just plain silly; but that does not mean I didn't like it. The style is fascinating. The gore is plentiful. The action is fast and furious. Every young man has six-pack abs and all the women were sexy and beautiful. The Spartan ideal of the best way to die is in battle so your name will live on in glory. Freedom is worth any sacrifice. Great movies like \\"Henry V\\", \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" and \\"Braveheart\\" use the same themes. The movie places the famous Spartan quotes in context like \\"Either return with your shield or on it\\" and Leonides's quote about \\"We will fight in the shade.\\" This was pretty cool.    The \\"BraveHeart\\" ending that the death of Leonides and the 300 at Thermopylae inspired the Greek city states to join together to fight the Persians was touching. In many ways 300 is like Braveheart on steroids.    The movie delivers just what you expect from the previews. I thought \\"Sin City\\" a better movie, but I had fun watching 300 and it in some ways exceeded my expectations.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|I've seen 3 of the 5 discs in the series and the images are spectacular.  I do not play them with sound (audio) because my patients simply love the incredible video presented.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|The music is instantly moving -- but its nuances are revealed slowly, and in layers, such that each successive listening becomes richer than the last.<br /><br />Get this CD. You won't regret it.
B000E5KJES|4.0|Considering the fact that this film is over fifteen years old, I was amazed by how well Warner Bros. tranferred this classic film over to HD DVD. However, this movie is relatively dark so there's not a lot of scenes that really blow the mind. That doesn't matter though because this is one of the best films of all time.
076792603X|4.0|If you haven't even remotely touched/read the book.. I highly suggest you get this Special Edition.  If you only have the original paperback, you should still get this Special Edition!<br /><br />The depicted pictures are of signifant reference to the story-telling.  And this book is evidently something to read more than once.<br /><br />If you have to choose between the movie or the book, I would suggest reading the book.  I did not find the movie as entertaining as the book captivating.
B000Q6GXW2|3.0|I liked the special effects in this movie, but I wish the makers of the film hadn't purposely made the movie so grainy. I know they wanted to mimic the \\"feel\\" of the novel and everything, but the graininess makes it so you can't really use this film to show off what HD DVD can do. Don't get me wrong, the HD DVD side is much crisper, clearer, and all around better than the standard DVD side but I guess I'll have to stick to King Kong on HD DVD to show people all that HD DVD has to offer.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|What's a mystery is simple.In the TRAILER..it's very clear...The ULGY..is suppose to be VAN CLEEF..&..the BAD..is ELLI WALLACH.But now go to the beginning of the movie..where they are introduce....VAN CLEEF now is refer to THE BAD...&..WALLACH..is refer to as THE UGLY.Othertwise...a great foreign western.Great Music.Super long drawn out plot...But who cares..with great American stars like..EASTWOOD,VAN CLEEF..& still around is ELI WALLACH.VAN CLEEF's kind will be truly missed.He was a great character star.
B000ICM5VW|4.0|This HD DVD is arguably the king of HD DVD demo material right now. The colors are sharp and vibrant, and the film is crystal clear. The audio is just as good. The only reason I took a star off is because the actual movie script is decent at best. Adrian Brody does a pretty good job, but overall the movie's plot is average. Luckily, I bought this movie for the stunning visual experience, so I'm not disappointed.
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini really has a gift. As soon as I finished reading, I wanted to read it again. I am getting ready to start the Kite Runner.
B000FA57NK|5.0|There is nothing that this movie is missing. It has great acting, great directing, great special effects, and the HD DVD transfer is flawless. More movies like this need to be released in the HD DVD format.

0375831002|5.0|Death is the narrator.  Yes, I know that is unconventional.  But wait, it's not as bad as you think.  Death makes quite a few observations of the human race, and he knows us well.  In this book, he looks back on his excursions surrounding the life of a German orphan girl, her foster parents, her neighbors, and her best friend, and what befell them during the hysteria of Hitler's reign in WWII Germany.  Liesel did not know how to read, but was fascinated by books.  The books she steals and collects, and the lives and deaths she intersected with are narrated by words and their meanings.  The final chapters of the book will bring tears to your eyes, yet it is a story about love, friendship, survival and memories.
0425179877|5.0|While I confess to being a lifelong space buff, this book is the first of many memoirs I have had the pleasure of reading from the actual men and women who participated in one of the greatest adventures in human history.  I read it nonstop from the moment I brought it home, and have reread many sections of it numerous times.  I believe it is a useful historical record of the golden era of the space program, but also holds many lessons for those who find themselves in formal or de facto positions of technical leadership in all types of organizations - churches, consulting firms, technical contractors, manufacturers, and probably many others with which I am not personally familiar.  Thank you Mr. Kranz for all you have shared!
0060594896|5.0|If anyone knows about success principles, it's Jack Canfield.  This book is a terrific guide to creating a successful life.  If you want to learn at the feet of the master, you'll pick up this book!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I'm updating my review (1/20/08)<br /><br />This CD is fantastic. I have Breakaway in position 4 & My December in postion 5 in my CD changer and I find myself skipping Breakaway after the title track to get to My December. I really like it more than Breakaway! (and I loved Breakaway.) Thank you Kelly! Raspberry to Clive!<br /><br />And you'll notice Amazon is now selling it for $13, not $9 like it was :(<br />I guess others like it too. :)<br /><br />---<br />(originally posted August 2007, using the title: People are not the one dimensional image Hollywood want's us to believe.)<br /><br />Kelly won AmIdol in 2002. That's 5 years ago. Look back at your life 5 years ago... are you the same person you were back then? What do you think you'll be like 5 years from now?<br /><br />The best thing about this CD is that we get to grow with Kelly. And that's what made Kelly #1 with the fans. We love her because she was just like us. Regular people, not Hollywood elitist or snobs. She's multi-talented, and multi-dimensional! Now some people complain because we see some other sides of Kelly? Heck I want more!<br /><br />Give this CD chance. It's very good. Forget what you expect it to be. Just stick it in the player and go about your work, exercise, or whatever you are doing. Put it on repeat. Let it sink in a few times.. Then stop it. I guarantee you, you'll be humming the tunes and singing (speaking?) the words.<br /><br />I remember when Pat Benetar came out with Get Nervous. Lots of people panned it. Now it's a classic. There are a lot of similarities between the two CDs.<br /><br />This CD should be judged on it's own and not \\"it's not another Breakaway.\\" I'm amazed that Amazon is selling this CD for $9! Deal of the year? You bet! If you let this one get away, you'll regret it.
141694740X|3.0|Obviously this book is a huge success and doesn't warrant yet another review from yet another relationship author.  The book's success lies in its basic premise and its easy breezy reading style.  My only complaint is why we don't know more about Liz Tucillo, the co-author, as we do about GB?
B000PFUA9G|2.0|One thing is for sure, Brad Paisley's effort on 5th Gear cannot be questioned. The album is definitely a labor of love. I have to admit that I'm only an occasional fan of his previous work, but I looked forward to this album as an opportunity to see how far he's come. Unfortunately, he's gone a lot further than I'd hoped.    The biggest drawback for me was the extensive use of sound clips. Sirens, music boxes, an airport PA system... its all there. I guess he couldn't make his point with the song alone, he had to \\"clue us in\\" with a sound clip. Generally, these kinds of sounds are reserved for amateurs playing with GarageBand. The full high school band at the end of \\"Online\\" was the most disappointing; the song was otherwise pretty good and the band at the end just ruins it.     Don't get me wrong; the album is not without its moments and some clever \\"hillbillies gone wild\\" sensibility. Paisley just lays on the latter way too thick. It's too much comedy with not enough straight ahead music to spare. I find the whole Kung Pao Buckaroos skit very confusing as part of a full length album. Also, while Christ clearly died to save sinners, a gospel tune following a song championing the \\"devil may care\\" attitude of \\"Bigger Fish To Fry\\" is confusing and a bit offensive. It seemed to me like another example of comedy gone too far. Various interludes, \\"hidden\\" comedy tracks at the end... it was all a bit too much for me. Will it be for you?    If you find yourself occasionally pining for Weird Al while you listen to your country music, then 5th Gear might be your thing. Otherwise, I suspect this is going to be a letdown for you. An extra star for this album because there are a few good numbers on there (\\"All I Wanted Was a Car\\", \\"Letter To Me\\"). Realistcally, there are so many good country albums out there to be bought. Unless you bought every great album over the last 20 years, you're bound to find something a little better than this worth buying. Save a few iTunes credits for the aforementioned highlights and just avoid the mistake I made.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This was an incredible production. The scenery, the quality of the filming was excellent. My entire family enjoyed watching this documentary. Even my children, who are not fans of nature films, stayed with us through out the whole show. A must have for any DVD library.
B000RIHBIE|5.0|If you're among the crowd that complains whenever a band changes direction, or you think bands should be forced to change their name when the original lineup changes, you won't like this album much. This album is clearly more \\"poppy\\" than the previous offerings. Gone is the failing attempt at Metallica-style guitar work and Fred Durst-denying rap rock. New is the failing attempt to sound more \\"mature\\" with lighter rock and overly political themes. Most people have identified this as a step in the Green Day direction; it probably is. The proof is in the fact that they pull it off.    So take a listen to some of the clips and give this album a chance if you like a little of what you hear. The album brings few surprises; what you hear on the clip is pretty much what you are going to get. There's a decent dose of catchy pop-punk on this album, particularly in the opening track. The band is occasionally more sappy than they've ever been. I think some of the slower numbers are actually good renditions within the genre. They don't advance the face of music, but lets face if; if you are reading this review you aren't interested in the cutting edge anyway. The production is very clean and there is more art in this pop than meets the eye.    One thing is for sure; this album is getting a lot more play than \\"Paper Walls\\" on my airwaves. This could be down to the simple fact that instead of actually sounding more mature, Sum 41 comes off as trying to sound mature but actually not growing up at all. Political rants that trivialize the American scene; tired analogies of bad behavior, and teen angst still reign supreme throughout. To that end, Sum 41 sticks to what they know; overaged teenagers refusing to give in to the maturation process.
0743298020|4.0|Diane Setterfield's debut is just what I needed; an original story with enough twists and turns to keep you thinking long after you put the book down.<br /><br />Margaret Lea, a bookshop clerk who writes biographies of obscure people on the side, receives a letter inviting her to write the biography of the most acclaimed novelist of the century, Vida Winter.  Little is known of Miss Winter except that over fifty years every time a journalist or biographer has tried to get her story she has spun a wonderful yarn completely different from the last version.  Does she really want to tell Margaret her REAL story, or is she out to tell another wonderful, but fictional account of her life.  Margaret sets out on a journey not only into the mind of a reclusive octagenarian novelist, but into her own past to uncover what it means to have a story and to share it.<br /><br />This is a must read for all book and story lovers.  4.5 stars.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Awesome DVD. I always wanted to get PULSE discs, but worth the wait for DVDs to come out. Clarity, sound everything is great. I absolutely loved the Bonus material. Though I wish it had video footage of setting up the PULSE stage and more historical information related to this tour. This is one of the best CD/DVD collection of PINK FLOYD ever. PINK FLOYD Rocks .... Anytime!!!!
B00004T9VY|5.0|Having recently seen Cat on Sunday Morning, it was pleasant and refreshing to hear his thoughts and comments. Tea for the Tillerman is a wonderful soul searching album. \\"Where do the Children Play\\" takes a cut at man's avarice and how in the end where will the children play.  \\"Miles from Nowhere\\" is probably one of my favorites because it is an honest insight to death stating that, in the end i will not need my body!  \\"But I Might Die Tonight\\" simply tells me we must search, strive for our goals in life, and be what you want to be.  The ahs and reverb added at the end of the song are soul moving.  \\"Father and Son\\" deals with a father and son trying to understand each other, and making up.<br />The album does not have one weak song. It deals with all aspects of life and what happens! For me its like a Beatles Album. No weak songs. If you love Acoustic guitar songs, this is perfect for you.
B00064WSN2|2.0|So the second coming of the Poseidon Adventure is just an audio soundtrack?  So the listener is supposed to discern what is going on by listening to this music?  This is just a bunch of guys drunk in a garage jamming, and they do not even do that good.  A guy, he like pics his guitar here and there like he is just goofing around.  So how am I supposed to visualize Nicolas Cage saving people from a sinking ship by listening to this?  Nuts!
1400049628|5.0|Keep this guide with you at all times, for you never know when you might need it.  I keep mine in an emergency supplies kit in the trunk of my car along with a machete.  You can never be too careful or too prepared.  I have a claw hammer in there too, just in case you forget to bring your machete since two machetes in the trunk would be too suspicious.
0385338902|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but didn't absolutely love it the way most other reviewers did.  Sometimes it seemed too slick for it's own good and that was a turnoff for me.  Every single sentence was conspicuously witty or wry to the point of overkill.  Still, I'd recommend it; I think it's just a matter of taste and it was a tad heavy on the salt for me.
B000SQKZKG|5.0|If there is a live CD that deserves a lot of atttention, it would be this. though it was recorded in 1973-74, it clearly shows the extraordinary power of the english trio at their peak moment; but above all we can say, the extended improvisation of \\"Piano Improvisations\\" by the Lord Keith Emerson will remain as one of the more mesmerizing of Progressive rock history. Its hard driving virtuosity shows the impressive chemistry inside the band, and how one thing stays clear: All the creative power of the Lord Keith Emerson was focused and captured on tape by the producer, lyricist and bassist, Lord Greg Lake that had an educated musical ear and a well earned reputation with King Crimson to allow him direct the musical concept of the group.<br /><br />Some notorious things are a little excerpt of the song \\"Epitaph\\", at the end of the totemic track \\"Tarkus\\" as a little bonus extracted from the first Crimson recordings. The experimental \\"Toccata\\", that shows an intent to explore new percussive sonic fields by the Lord of the skins Carl Palmer with keith Emerson. We can check another intent to expand this sonic barriers in the track \\"Infinite Space\\" of the TARKUS album.<br />And the track \\"Take A Pebble\\" that in the original version the sound of the bass was really gloomy, owed to a bad mixed sound recording. But you can appreciate here a better bass sound in general for the remastered treatment.<br /><br />It would be more acurate that this live rendition contains another famous tracks like \\"Knife-Edge\\", \\"Trilogy\\" or \\"Beaches Crystal\\" but anyway it will stands as one of the more outstanding live recordings of the Progressive Rock genre. So Godd Luck!...
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I never expected this would hold my attention for more than 15 minutes, and I didn't get up from my chair through the entire movie.

B000TGCR38|5.0|IF YOU LIKED \\"THE LIVES OF OTHERS\\" THEN YOU WILL \\"LOVE\\" THIS FILM. IT MAY NOT RANK AS HIGH AS SCHINDLER'S LIST,BUT IT IS A FILM NOT TO BE MISSED. THE YOUNG WOMAN PLAYING THE LEAD, CARICE VAN HOUTEN, IS A DUTCH VERSION OF KATE BLANCHETTE. THEY ARE BOTH BRILLIANT ACTORS. THE STORY OF HER SURVIVAL IS A STRONG ONE, AND THE PERFORMANCES OF ALL THE ACTORS WERE INCREDIBLY WELL CRAFTED. AN EXCELLENT SCRIPT, AN EXCELLENT CAST AND WITH PAUL VERHOVEN AS THE DIRECTOR THIS FILM IS A MUST SEE. IT IS NOW THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST AND I BELIEVE BLACK BOOK TO BE THE BEST FILM I HAVE SEEN SO FAR THIS YEAR(2007). I WOULD NOMINATE THIS FILM FOR ONE OF THE BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURES OF THE YEAR, IN FACT, THE BEST!
0743496728|3.0|This is the third Jodi Picoult book I've read, after My Sister's Keeper and The Tenth Circle, and it's my least favorite of the three.  It's still good, but after reading three of her books, you begin to see recurrent themes.  There is much deserved teen angst over some horrible condition or event, and always some sort of unexpected twist at the end.  Because I expected it here after reading the other two books, I predicted what it would be in this book, and that probably took away from my giving this book four stars.    I think My Sister's Keeper is the best out of what I've read, and if your time is limited, read that book instead of this one.
B000PKG4SC|5.0|A voice as powerful as ever.    The Living Tree is a Fantastic song and there are Great re-mixes of hits from this legendary vocalist.

B000PFUA9G|4.0|Having bought all of his albums as they have been released I was a bit disappointed with the last one but this new release sees Brad back on track with some great tunes, playing and plenty of humour. I love the Buckeroo's singing \\"Bigger fish to fry\\" and the excellent \\"Better than this\\". I still think his debut album was his best thus far but he's got a CD here to be proud of.
0061186422|5.0|Neil Gaiman is an artist of prose and poetry.  In his capable hands, ordinary things become new worlds of magic and mystery:<br /><br />  * Favorite nursery-rhyme friends become suspects in a film-noir detective's murder case.<br />  * Mystical artifacts turn up on the bargain racks in the local charity donation shops.<br />  * Seemingly normal parties are mere covers for intergalactic research and experimentation.<br /><br />Readers can almost always expect the unexpected from Gaiman, and \\"M is for Magic\\" is no different.  The short story format allows readers to squeeze a little bit of fantasy into their ordinary lives, while the finely crafted plots and characters leave one eagerly anticipating the next little journey, making it a hard-to-put-down treasure box.<br /><br />In contrast to some of Gaiman's more \\"adult\\" works, this collection of short stories was compiled to appeal to a younger audience.  All of these stories were originally published in other collections or periodicals, but are still a delight to read over and over again.  I would definitely recommend this book as an addition to any fantasy lover's bookshelf--young and old alike.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jeannine R. Burkholder<br />08/14/2007
B00008CMR6|4.0|The first part of this western is relatively unique; the second part is commonplace in John Wayne movies. The latter contains such themes as shootouts between posses of good and bad guys, a trade of kidnapped men (the bad guys' boss for Frenchie), and heavy drinking. In fact, McNally (Wayne) has this comment about a drink: \\"Boy, this stuff ain't for the young!\\"<br /><br />The train robbery is creatively portrayed. A group of Confederate guerillas, evidently tipped off about a transport of gold, tap-in into a telegraph wire, and thereby correctly infer which train is going to carry the gold. Then they set up a trap: They grease a section of railway so that the targeted train will stall for lack of traction. Once this happens, they come out of hiding and ambush the train. They throw a bag of bees into a train compartment in order to put the men inside out of action and to force them to jump out of the train. Finally, they detach the gold-bearing wagon from the rest of the train, and steer it to a prearranged place where it can be ground to a halt and stripped of its gold-bearing chest.<br /><br />Those who feel that westerns ignore women or always place them in passive roles will like this film.

006112429X|5.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" starts out very strong... I couldn't put it down until page 150. Then, more than once over the next 150 pages, I got annoyed. Despite its perfectly detailed writing, the conceit (the entire novel is a series of letters) and sheer length (400 pages, in a smaller than usual typeface) of this story strained my patience. Thankfully, Lionel Shriver understands something about payoff. The end of this book had the hairs standing up on the back of my neck. Wow. Very well done. What would have been a four star review gets a bump due to the thoroughly satisfying ending.<br /><br />Clearly Shriver can write. I especially love how small, well chosen details convey characters so well. I love the letter in which Eva describes her husband purely through his quotidian interests. She has also taken on an unwieldy topic -- senseless murder. To a certain extent this debate has already occured a million times in the media, with conclusions no more conclusive than what Shriver can come up with. That's the condondrum of senseless things... there aren't any profound answers. For these reasons (quality of writing and ambition of subject) I think this is one of the better books I've read this year.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|If you like romance, you're in for a treat.  I loved this movie but, I have to admit I'm a huge Renée Zellweger, Ewan McGregor and Beatrix Potter fan.  I thought the acting was top notch and the movie was well directed.  The movies creative flair breathes life into Beatrix Potter's characters.  It will inspire you to want to become an illustrator and or writer if you've ever dreamed of being one.  I also liked the special features included on the DVD about Beatrix Potter's life and the making of the movie. I say, \\"A must see for any Zellweger fan\\"  Cheerio
B00003CXXP|3.0|Movies exist to entertain us, to make us happy, to give us relief from our tedious boring lives or to give us something interesting to think about. Even movies with sad endings fulfil at least one of these purposes but AI Artificial Intelligence was extremely depressing for every minute of its 146 min length.    Artificial Intelligence is set in a future world where rising oceans have sunk many of the world's coastal cities. Humans have created androids to be prostitutes, nannies, etc. The androids are very intelligent and can feel emotions but have virtually no rights. They are hunted and slaughtered by fanatical humans who serve as antagonists in the movie.  The story is about an android boy seeking the love of his human mother. It was hopeless right from the beginning. David seems like an ordinary child but his behaviour is inhuman in a very subtle way (excellent acting by Haley Joel Osment). David is programmed to love his mother unconditionally but he is manipulated by his human brother into making some very big mistakes. Feeling sorry for him, his mother abandons David, instead of sending him back to the factory to be disassembled. He spends the rest of the movie wandering around, looking for the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy. He's accompanied by an android gigolo and an intelligent teddy bear that do their best to put some comic relief into this dreary movie.    Artificial Intelligence is supposed to be a story about the human inability to love anyone who is different. David is impossible not to feel sorry for. No one deserves what happened to him. Monica seems really evil for failing to love David after making him love her. But the real sin is getting David in the first place. Humans are not supposed to love machines. It's unnatural. It's wrong. If our lovers and children are replaced with machines it can only lead to the inevitable extinction of the human race. It may be immoral to kill sentient beings but the Flesh Fairs are doing the right thing. Theyinstinctively see the androids as a threat to the survival of their race and for good reason. The real tragedy in this movie is not David's personal story, but the fact that androids will gradually overcome humanity's instinctual revulsion as they become more human-like and humanity will condemn itself to a slow, lingering death.    The movie's ending is happy, sad and very bizarre at the same time. This is a movie that will leave an unpleasant feeling in your mind long after it's over.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Alright guys, I know, I know... When I first listened to this album, my initial reaction was, \\"what the ....!?\\" Like the rest of us, I was used to the hardcore, headbanging amazing collaboration of rock and rap that only Linkin Park could deliver. We all know: Hybrid Theory and Meteora were awesome for their originality. This is why we need to give Minutes to Midnight a fighting chance. In case some of you havn't realized it by now, this album isn't about Chester's or Mike's problems in the world: it's about the world's problems and how they've contributed to them, at least I think so. (hence the name of their tour: Projekt Revolution) Either way, I think we all have to admit that making the transition from singing about themselves to singing about the rest of the world takes a lot of guts. Plus, I think that they did damn good job. I mean, seriously, listen to their lyrics. And once your done, do it again and again. After all of that, go look at the top world news headslines; look at how the lyrics and wolrd events just flow. It's not magic; it's the pure ingenius that only Linkin Park could so cleanly deliver. This is why that I think, with time, we'll appreciate and agree that Minutes to Midnight is the greatest album that Linkin Park has invented so far.

0802130208|1.0|For many years, I have heard what a hilarious book this was. I consider myself to be a jovial person in every way, but this book put me to sleep. I could have easily closed it after 20 pages or so, but I slogged on because I was determined to find out what was so funny. The answer was: NOTHING. They keep talking about making a movie out of it...I think the financing has fallen short because it's not a comedy, it's not a drama....it's a sedative.
B00005LC1H|5.0|John Cleese is priceless as want-to-be highbrow hotelier Basil Fawlty in this madcap series about life at the fictional Fawlty Towers Hotel in Torquay, England.  Enthusiasts of slapstick comedy will marvel at the contortions Cleese and the marvelous Andrew Sachs (Manuel) put themselves through, and Prunella Scales does a wonderful job portraying the put-upon -- and occasionally trying in her own right -- Sybil Fawlty.  Inspired writing by Cleese and then-wife Connie Booth (the show's capable housekeeper) makes these programs a joy to experience as Basil's aspirations toward an upper class clientele result in ever-greater disasters.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|This thriller, with the indefatigable Anthony Hopkins and relative newcomer Ryan Gosling, inevitably reminded me of Silence of the Lambs. Hopkins plays a cold blooded killer, who blatantly shoots his wife and seemingly gets away with it.

All he has to do is quit. But he just can't let Hopkins get away with murder.     Hopkins is suitably menacing, Gosling just committed enough to win our sympathy. You  know Hopkins can't be allowed to get away with it (there'd be no movie otherwise) but figuring out how he almost does keeps the suspense up.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|This amazing and painful German film looks at life in East Germany in 1984, five years before the Wall came tumbling down. Georg Dreyman (played by Sebastian Koch) is a successful, apolitical playwright. He's a friend of the Ministry of Culture, which supports him as one of the few examples of a respected artist flourishing in the repressive regime.  Ulrich Muhe is an idealistic Stasi (secret police) captain, who believes that the ministry is the \\"sword and shield\\" of the government, and a passing suspicion of his leads to full blown surveillance of Dreyman.     What starts off as a story of artistic oppression, however, rapidly becomes the story of the slow disillusionment of the Captain. Muhe has an amazingly expressive face, and in close-ups of him listening to conversations in Dreyman's apartment, he manages, without barely changing expression, to communicate his slowly dawning horror at what he's been told to do.  He begins to fabricate reports to protect Dreyman, who lives in blissful ignorance of the danger he's in. Martina Gedeck, in the role of Dreyman's lover, is a famous actress, but lacks confidence in her talent and fears above all not being able to work. She knows she is weak, knows that under pressure she will betray anyone, and she's wonderful in her portrayal of a quite ordinary person who inevitably becomes part of the state mechanisms of oppression.     This film is painful to watch, despite the redemptive ending, and as much as we know about Communist regimes, it always comes as a shock when we see it close up and real. There's no torture and violence here, just the slow grinding down of the human spirit. It's bleak, but well worth your time.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Firstly found it on Amazon much cheaper than anywhere else. Next of course, the cinematography is top class. David Attenborough's voiceover adds character to the entire series. I watched the US version on Discovery and was certain I had to own a copy. Totally worth it.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I don't recall how old I was when I first saw the film version of \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" John Steinbeck's novel of the desperate plight of the \\"Okies\\" during the Dust Bowl era -- I know I'd read the book after graduating high school and before entering college -- but on second viewing, I was impressed by how closely the film followed the book. Certainly, a fully realized cinematic treatment would have overtaxed Hollywood budgets and the average moviegoer of 1940, and the novel's final scene would never have been okayed by the censors, but the overall emotional pull of the film is about as close to that of the book in a way that few literature-as-film productions ever are. (Of recent note in this respect are Peter Jackson's fine films of J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy --although I still haven't forgiven him for leaving out Tom Bombadil.) Of course, the genius lay in the casting of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, though to be honest, none of the casting choices were faulty. I'm teaching the novel for the first time for a literature class this semester, and I would be quite comfortable allowing non-readers to substitute viewing this film in place of reading the entire book. I can think of no better tribute to a first-rate movie than that.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|In my humble opinion this series is one of the best Sci-Fi shows to hit television in a very long time. The Fox network killed it by showing them out of order and showing them every other week, helter skelter. The fan base was phenominal and wouldn't let the series die until they were able to convince Universal to make a final movie to wrap-up the lose ends. The final movie, Serenity, is to be released on DVD Aug. 21st, 07. I never saw the movie when it came out in 2005 and can hardly wait to see it. The series is probably too violent for younger children but OK for 13 yrs and up. I thought this was a wonderful, entertaining, exciting series and would highly recommend it to Sci-Fi and Western fans and really, anybody who loves a good story.

B000FFJ85I|3.0|When I found out that AFI was going to be a musical guest on Saturday Night Live, my brother asked whom they were, and I told him that they are a rock band that's been out for a few years but now they have a \\"sellout\\" song. Maybe it's not fair to say that about \\"Miss Murder\\", but to be honest, much of Decemberunderground seems to have that vibe.<br /><br />Some artists claim that they don't care about making hit records so long as they have devoted fans, but then they turn around and make one or two songs for the radio. It's not that AFI weren't accessible in the past, but \\"Miss Murder\\" is arguably the most pop-sounding song they've done, and the thing is, much of the rest of the album sounds a little too pop-ish as well. Now, I listen to my share of emo, but that's not what AFI is. I mean, \\"37mm\\" and \\"The Killing Lights\\" are fine and all, but songs like that could have easily been done by Fall Out Boy or the Click Five.<br /><br />And when they try to go back and make \\"harder\\" songs, they kind of sound like wannabe versions of themselves, mainly because Davey appears to be screaming just for the sake of screaming (see \\"Kill Caustic\\", \\"Endlessly, She Said\\", \\"Kiss and Control\\" or \\"Affliction\\"). And speaking of Davey's vocals, aside from the first two singles \\"Miss Murder\\" and \\"Love Like Winter\\" (my personal favorite), he sounds completely different on every song. Casual rock fans will probably still like this album, but if you're a core fan of the band, I don't suggest you pick this up because after listening to it, you might suggest that AFI should stand for A F'n Imitation.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
0439813786|5.0|This is a book that's impossible to stop reading, and it's a genre all its own:  part novel, part graphic novel, part sketchbook, and part classic cinema. Somehow, it does all of those things beautifully.  Through beautiful drawings and spare, lovely prose, Selznick tells the story of Hugo Cabret, an Oliver-Twist-type character living in a Paris train station and trying to reconnect with his lost father through a mysterious mechanical man he saved from a fire.  Like parts of the automaton, the pieces of this story turn and lock into place to reveal a magical mystery.

Visually the film making is stunning and often very glamourous and sexy. Lynch's first all-digital all-Dern \\"film\\" will take your breath away, if you give in to it.
1416523359|1.0|This was the worst King novel I have ever read. I thought I would never be done reading it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was padded with all kinds of dribble that didn't help the book at all except to make it longer. There was too much of what a character was thinking and not enough action. The plot was totally unbelievable. It was difficult to follow. I just couldn't wait to finish it so I could throw it in the trash where it belonged.

0307346609|3.0|It seems like Max Brooks really tried with this one but it just didn't do it for me. All of the different accounts from people should have added to the realism of the book and solidified the human element of the scenario. I felt that the many short accounts led to a choppy reading experience and didn't give the reader enough information on characters to relate to them as real people. It was hard to keep in mind that all of these accounts were supposed to be normal people from different parts of the world.     Another thing that was upsetting about this novel was the prominence of  author's world view. I like to read zombie books for zombies and the human interactions that they cause. I don't read these books for people's half-baked political opinions. The idea that Israel would save all Palestinians from all over the world is ludicrous. His whole treatment of Israel in this novel went beyond any \\"Israel is the nice guy and does nothing bad ever\\" fantasy. He should have had Israel save all surrounding Arab countries while he was at it. Also, the way he handled North Korea and South Africa made me laugh.     While this book had some serious flaws, it is better written than most books in this genre. However, if you are reading zombie books for zombies and HUMAN interaction (not nation-state, government interaction), then this book is probably not for you.
0525476881|5.0|I'll be honest -- it took me a little while to warm up to AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES.   I started the book convinced that I'd love it, because how could the author of LOOKING FOR ALASKA let me down?  John Green's voice is every bit as authentic and funny in this book, but the math bugged me.  Here's the premise.  Child prodigy Colin Singleton gets dumped by 19 girls named Katherine, takes his wounded heart on a road trip with his friend Hassan, meets a spectacular cast of characters in a dying factory town called Gutshot, and tries to cement his place in history by coming up with a formula to graph romantic relationships.      Really, I thought.  Who thinks this way?  I love words and tolerate numbers, at best.  I do not have a math brain, so I wasn't buying into it.  Until my 10-year-old son, who does have a math brain, came home from school and showed me the graphical representation he'd made of his two groups of friends, predicting how those two groups might interact when they leave their two elementary schools next year and join together at the middle school.  It was like John Green was standing over my shoulder with a smug look, saying, \\"See??\\"  I read the rest of the book with a much-improved attitude toward the math and loved the connections, the karma, and (mild spoiler ahead...) the fact that the nice guy gets the girl in the end.
0593055063|1.0|I have never written a book review.  Call me lazy.  But this book was so surprisingly awful that I felt compelled to warn others.    The plot isn't very plausible if you know anything at all about computers.  I won't beat that to death though as it's not my main gripe.  No, my gripe is with the characters.    One of the main characters (Susan) is written as being so incredibly stupid, it's beyond belief.  She's built up as some genius cryptographer, yet you'd have trouble distinguishing her from someone in the cast of Desperate Housewives.  Dan Brown obviously wanted someone to \\"not understand\\" things so he'd have a way to go about spelling things out to Susan... and the reader, but he goes too far.  Susan's stupidity is a constant annoyance, but it gets even worse by the time we get to the climactic finale.  By then, her stupidity has spread to nearly everyone else in the room with her.  I won't give out a spoiler, but suffice it to say that there's a group of people trying to figure out the answer to a question and what took me a couple of minutes to solve took that room of people a LOT longer.  Thinking that maybe it was just me, I gave the clues to my wife and she spit the answer out right away as well.    I'm sure many fans of the DaVinci Code will be thinking of picking this up on the author's name alone, but I'm telling you you should reconsider.  This book was so bad that it totally erased all of the good credit Dan Brown had with me.
B000002BYA|5.0|Live At Carnegie Hall was recorded on October 4, 1984 (one day after Stevie's thirtieth birthday). There are also guest appearances by John Hammond, Jimmie Vaughan, Dr. John, vocalist Angela Strehli (who sings an enthusiastic lead vocal on C.O.D.) and the Roomful Of Blues horn section.<br /><br />The performance is an intimate blues celebration. At the end of the night, Stevie says, \\"Thank you very much for making this my best birthday ever...forever!\\".<br /><br />The sound and production are clean and crisp; the performances are inspired (that's an understatement on some of the songs!). This is a fantastic version of Cold Shot, and Lenny is simply AMAZING. Things That I Used To Do and Dirty Pool are both jaw-dropping; Stevie at his blues-guitar best.<br /><br />Pride And Joy and Iced Over both sound as good as ever and the horn section adds to the sound instead of hampering it, and it gives the songs new life.<br /><br />More than just good blues, Live At Carnegie Hall is a warm and intimate documentary of a special night in the life of Sevie Ray Vaughan, his friends and family.
B00003CWTI|1.0|Youre going to either love this movie or hate it.  I'm usually on the \\"love it\\" side but this one was a total disaster.  The plot, the LENGTH (goes on forever), theres no excitement, and the actors overact in every scene.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|The music was light hearted and fun. Some of it was incredibly ridiculous, but then, so were the 80s. Hugh Grant has surprising musical talent and Haley Bennett who played Cora Coreman was excellent. As always, Drew Barrymore brings an almost childlike sweetness to her romantic comedy roles, without coming off as stupid. I always enjoy her work.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|This cut of Kevin Smith's debut contains a handful of extra or extended scenes along with a different ending. All of it adding something to the released version from 1994. For me however the joy of this edition is the documentary about the making of Clerks. Clips of the casting sessions with the actors, stories about Kevin & longtime collaborative partner in crime Scott Mosier in the earliest days of being mates at film school, Bob Hawk talking about first seeing the film etc... this stuff was great.     Know that I'm a huge Smith fan and sort of lock-step buy anything with his name on it. Curse you showtime for not green lighting Man Child!
B00005R8FI|4.0|John Mayall's bands have been training grounds for many a guitarist.  John had just given up Mick Taylor to the Stones and he didn't have a drummer.  So John decided to put together a lineup with NO drummer.  Unheard of in Rock or a Blues band.  But it worked.    This album is a great album recorded live that leans more towards jazz than blues.  It is a must have album.  My personal favorites are \\"California\\" and \\"Room to Move\\"  The band is tight and the songs are some of Mayall's best.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|This is a very strong film, that features some remarkable performances by Ryan Gosling and newcomer Shareeka Epps.  It acknowledges, but avoids falling prey to many of the stereotypes about inner city schools, drug users and dealers, and relationships between blacks and whites.  Above all it works because it is not trying to prove anything, there are no simple or straightforward morals here, and the characters do try but don't always succeed in doing the \\"right thing\\" -- and the film does not pretend to know exactly what that is even when it does point to certain dangers.  The dialogue is excellent, the film looks good (nothing fantastic, but very competently directed, in such a way as to not draw attention away from the characters or the story, which is really the point here), the music is strong and supports the emotions that come out of the story, without forcing them upon you.  You really can't ask for more, this film is another indication that in spite of the attention given to first weekend grosses of big blockbusters, the heart of American cinema remains in the small independent films that address real issues faced by real people.

B000OVLBFS|4.0|The \\"Jesse Stone\\" series of TV movies goes against the recent trend of fewer and low-rated TV movies (mostly because they are uniformly bad). Possibly it's because it's not aimed at the almighty 18-25 demographic, a lot of more mature watchers will tune in for a movie made for adults.    \\"Night Passage\\" is based on the first \\"Jesse Stone\\" novel of the same name by Robert B. Parker, best known for his \\"Spenser\\" novels and television series. Why this story, which \\"introduces\\" the Stone character when he initially moves the ex-cop from LA to Paradise, MA, was not made first (it's the 4th Stone flick) makes one wonder about what the studio suits were thinking.    What this film lacks in explosions and car chases it more than makes up for in character development, mood and style. Tom Selleck absolutely \\"nails\\" the character as the demon-plagued Jesse, trying to make a fresh start as Police Chief in a small New England town, away from the crime and grime of LA, along with his drinking problem and his inability to delete lingering feelings for his unfaithful ex-wife.    Parker should feel fortunate that the conversion to film didn't transform his literary character --as television and movies usually do-- into just another cliche-ridden, cardboard action figure. I still think people should be shot for what Hollywood did to \\"Matt Helm\\" years ago.    All four films are well-done and well-acted and well worth the time to appreciate the nuances of the characters and the setting.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|Anthony Hopkins loves movies where he can wipe the floor with his costars. He is almost giddy in roles like Hannibal Lector. His character in director Gregory Hoblit's latest thriller, Fracture, is no different. Like the eggshell analogy that Hopkins makes to his costar Ryan Gosling, Fracture falls prey to the same smarmy advice the star gives out: everything, no matter how perfect it may look, has a flaw.<br /><br />When wealthy and intelligent aerodynamics expert Ted Crawford (Hopkins) catches his wife in an act of infidelity with a Los Angeles homicide detective, he cooks up an elaborate plan to not only kill his wife, but to legally get away with it. What should have been an open and shut case for District Attorney Willy Beachum turns into a career ending nightmare as Crawford seemingly outsmarts the law at every turn.<br /><br />Though the direction, acting and visual style in Fracture is fantastic, the hairline crack that splinters the picture is the film's attempt at creating suspense by relying on a twist ending that is easily predictable given the information that is presented early in the film. How exactly does Crawford shoot his wife in the face with a weapon that has never been fired? Given the revealing marketing for the film, which gives away the circumstances surrounding the murder, audiences can easily trace the steps that Hopkins takes early in the film, clearly giving them an idea of where Fracture is going.<br /><br />In the best thrillers, when the inevitable twist hits, it is the little clues scattered throughout the picture which give the ending credibility. While all these details are within Fracture, they are so clear that if you don't see the crack in the villain's flawless plan immediately, you will be kicking yourself when the film finally presents it to you.<br /><br />That being said, how does Fracture manage to hold the audience's attention despite its blatant reveal of the picture's number one mystery? While a less experienced director might rely heavily on this twist alone, Gregory Hoblit manages to see through what could have been a thinly veiled, plot driven movie and finds an intriguing character study.<br /><br />While Hopkins chews up the scenery with his vast intellect and charming whit, Fracture is really the story of Willy Beachum. Considering the fact that Fracture consists of a cast which includes an Academy Award winner and two nominees, it was to be expected that Hoblit should have no problem drawing performances from his actors. The real surprise in Fracture is just how well planned out the story of Willy Beachum was.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling's character begins the film as an arrogant, hot shot district attorney who has been put on the fast track, landing a job in the private sector. Thinking that Crawford's case will be the last in his short tenure serving the public, Beachum shrugs off what appears to be an easy win. His refusal to take the case seriously, combined with Crawford's meticulous planning, ultimately leads to Beachum's downfall. With his cushy job in jeopardy, Beachum's character develops a methodical obsession with Crawford, searching desperately to find the one clue that will put his nemesis away for good.<br /><br />As the film progresses Gosling's character changes from cocky to heroic. At first it is fun to see Hopkins toy with him, but thanks to Gosling's surprisingly good acting and Hoblit's taught direction, as Beachum changes, so does the audience's expectations. We want Gosling to come out on top. This change, from selfishness to selflessness is what gives his character the roundness that carries Fracture past its faults.<br /><br />Though predictable, it is the dramatic arc of Willy Beachum which separates Fracture from just another episode of Law and Order. While Hopkins' character begins the film as a smarmy antihero, he essentially pushes Beachum into becoming the unlikely champion of the story, and in some ways Fracture showcases one legendary actor passing on the torch to another.<br /><br />-Joe Russo
B00006V9A0|5.0|This album has the better songs since the begginig till the end, and hasa a extra song that was never recorded (You know you´re all right), if you like rock you must have it, if you like nirvana you must have it and if you never listened to nirvana this album is just perfect.
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|Fan or not ... you must have this \\"Book Of The Dead 2\\" edition.  Just one bad point to say if you compare Evil Dead 2 \\"Book Of The Dead\\" with the first Evil Dead \\"Book Of The Dead\\" ... this dvd is just in English !  No other language selection !  Otherwise a very very good quality for this product.  Real fine and a little surprise if you push the white eye.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Having recently discovered the wondrously talented Rufus Wainwright  through the track Cigarettes and chocolate milk, I knew I had to hear more,hence the purchase of the magic which is Poses. Each track is   totally different, no odious repetitions, each so gloriously melodic,  whether it be up tempo or a ballad, at the very heart of each track  lies a beautiful orchestration. The voice can soar to such heartbreaking  heights, you feel he belongs in another time and place, a modern day  travelling minstrel bringing his tales and music to the masses. BRILLIANT
0807126063|5.0|I saw a review trashing this book, calling it a sedative. When I read it a few weeks ago, I found it amusing here and there most of the way. But I was not deeply impressed, most of the way. The obstacle, for me, was that Ignatius Reilly's behavior was too absurd to identify with. He could not be real to me.     At some point, late in the book, I permitted Toole to impose his universe on mine and it all became Theater of the Absurd (which does not work unless one yields to the playwright). Then, the book became hysterically funny. I am a school bus driver and was up in Golden Gate Canyon (northwest of Denver) alone for the better part of seven hours. Toole's book was my companion. There is a scene in the book, the last scene with Dr. Talc. It took me about half an hour to read a simple paragraph in that scene because I was laughing so hard, I had to keep putting the book down. There was a single sentence which brought on three separate paroxysms of laughter, doubling me over. I had to work my diaphragm with my fists to force air into my lungs. Two hours later, I went back and read that paragraph and it started all over again.
B000002MIY|4.0|Welcome to Donald Fagen's 1993 followup from his first solo experiment, The Nightfly. Kamakiriad is a slight contrast to his previous masterpiece, which was absolutely a 5 star item. While this CD can't touch The Nightfly's brilliance, it comes close, and is a great listen.    Just like The Nightfly, Kamakiriad only has 8 tracks. This must be a peculiarity of Fagen's, however as before, these 8 tracks are each pretty long. Not one of them is less than 5 minutes long. Another unique thing about this album is the presence of an accompanying story, you see its called Kamakiriad for a reason. As you will read in the insert, Kamakiriad is the narrator's story, who is just about to embark on a journey several years into the future in his brand new dream car, a custom tooled 'Kamakiri'. And it is built for the new century, steam driven, and linked with a tripstar routing satellite system, etc. The songs of Kamakiriad describe his adventures into the unknown. Some say it is slightly silly, but like it or not you have to admit that it's unique. Afterall, we know that Donald Fagen is not your average artist.    \\"Trans-Island Skyway\\" begins with a funky bit of guitar chords, something that bears Walter Becker's signature. It is different than anything you might find in The Nightfly, but not so different I think from something stamped with the Steely Dan seal of approval. A good opening to the story. \\"Countermoon\\" is again funky, but has a beat more accustomed to The artist Donald Fagen, rather than the Performer Donald Fagen. Nice jazzy backup vocals too. The next two songs are the two best songs here. \\"Springtime\\" is slow at the beginning, sort of crouching, ready to ambush you with some funk. Once it gets going, it won't stop. Smooth steady beat. Following is \\"Snowbound\\", a very excellent song here. It's cool, and more akin to some of The Nightfly's more jazzy tracks. This is my favorite, and its 7.08 min. long! \\"Tommorow's Girls\\" is pretty good stuff, as is \\"Florida Room\\" which bears a nice sax. Once you finish off the combined 12 min. of those two songs, you will encounter the relaxed, 8.07 min. long \\"On the Dunes\\". I know these songs are long, but seeing as it's Donald Fagen, how can one complain? Still, if you get too tired of this song, skip on down to \\"Teahouse On the Tracks\\". It rounds out the CD with more of the same jazzy funkness. Most of these songs do sound the same, so whether or not you like the sound is what will make this album a hit or a miss. As for me, well I've given it 4 stars and I do think that it is better than Fagen's most recent work, Morph the Cat.    Like I said, there is an underlying note here that sound suspiciously like Walter Becker, and it is a welcomed presence. I enjoy this album. It's laid back and subtle. If you are not familiar with Fagen's previous album, 1982's The Nightfly, then I highly urge you to check it out as well. It is one of the best CD's of all time. But here now, Donald Fagen's Kmakiriad!

B00062RCBW|5.0|One of the best casts, if not the best, of ANY Science Fiction series ever, was brought together to reinvent a lot of what we knew sci-fi to be. Gene Roddenberry brought an amazing new world to us with some of the most amazing effects and writing where the focus on the story was more about society and discovery and how humanity could cope with that, than anything else. This as an absolute must have for anyone looking for great entertainment for the household, or even for themselves. Beware though... Lwaxana Troi may terrorize your days ;-) (Majel is just amazing on those guest appearances!)
B000002KE2|5.0|In my southeastern Virginia high school back in the late 1980s, the members of Led Zeppelin were considered gods among men. If you were a white male and didn't listen to Zeppelin, you were a pariah. No exceptions. Not that it was difficult to like Zeppelin - they were in constant rotation on WNOR and I rarely heard a song by them I disliked (`Trampled Underfoot' being a notable exception). Discussions of Zeppelin often devolved into wistful laments that we hadn't been born a decade earlier and been able to experience the band before John Bonham's untimely demise resulted in their sudden dissolution. We were all quite certain that Zeppelin were the heaviest band ever and that they would remain so for time immemorial. In retrospect, it seems almost inconceivable that none of us had any idea that another band contemporaneous with Zeppelin matched, if not exceeded, them in heaviness. That band was Black Sabbath and somehow no one in my high school had heard of them.    During the early 90s when the Seattle scene rose to national prominence, bands like Soundgarden and Alice in Chains rarely missed a chance to proclaim in interviews how much their music had been influenced by Black Sabbath. At the time, I made a mental note to check out Sabbath then misplaced that note for more than 10 years. Finally, in 2004, Sabbath's Black Box set was released and I made a major impulse buy, sating my long dormant curiosity about Sabbath with one massive purchase. The evening I found Sabbath's first eight albums on my doorstep, I slid them one by one into my portable cd player, listening to the first four in sequence until late into the night. I was immediately struck by how much my Zeppelin-loving classmates and I would have cherished these albums 15 years earlier. Master of Reality and Vol. 4 became instant favorites and stayed in heavy rotation on my cd player for months thereafter.    Now that several years have passed since I finally became acquainted with Black Sabbath's music, Ican confidently claim Vol. 4 as my favorite of their first eight albums. Derided by many fans and critics upon its release as disappointing and disjointed due to the intense drug addictions afflicting several band members at the time, Vol. 4 remains fascinating to me even after countless listens. It begins on an epic note with `Wheels of Confusion' which, in its sixth minute, morphs into `The Straightener' in one of the great transitions in the history of rock music. After the dizzying highs provided by `Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener', `Tomorrow's Dream' is a rather less inspiring but nevertheless strong track featuring some classic Sabbath riffage. The ballad, `Changes', divides Sabbath fans like few other songs. If, like my friend Chris, you focus on the gorgeous melody of the chorus and ignore the simplistic lyrics, you will love this song. If, like me, however, you can't get past the words `I'm going through changes...I'm going through changes\\", you will limit yourself to admitting only a grudging admiration for the song. `FX' is a brief bout of bizarre noodling that I am quite sure cannot be anyone's favorite Black Sabbath song. However, it does provide a somewhat atmospheric lead-in to the paint-peeling romp `Supernaut', a song as heavy as any in Sabbath's catalogue of `two-ton heavy thing(s)'. The highlight of a song full of highlights has to be when Bill Ward's drum solo grades into Tony Iommi's resumption of the song's key riff. No words can do that moment justice - you'll just have to hear it for yourself, preferably at high volume. Remarkably, the subsequent track, `Snowblind' is every bit as good as `Supernaut', only a whole lot druggier, with Ozzy repeatedly whispering `cocaine' during the chorus. No doubt `Snowblind' was the track most responsible for earning Vol. 4 its reputation as Sabbath's most drug-addled album. `Cornucopia' begins with a classic piece of Sabbath sludge before speeding up into a series of catchy riffs. `Laguna Sunrise' isa short mellow instrumental that I can take or leave, but usually choose to listen to since it sets a nice mood for the almost hoe-down worthy `St.Vitus Dance'. In the same way it begins, Vol. 4 closes with two tracks combined into one. `Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes' is a rant against organized religion with soaring vocals provided over riffs ranging from molasses slow to hummingbird fast. All in all, a tremendous album that was underrated when it was released and remains underappreciated by many Black Sabbath fans to this day.     When I think of how much I would have loved Vol. 4 back in high school, I feel a twinge of regret. However, there is much consolation in the realization that I waited to experience Black Sabbath for the first time in my 30s when I could appreciate it more fully than in high school when it would have had to compete with Led Zeppelin for my attentions. It is hard to say who would have won had I known about both bands back then, though my subsequent metal-biased listening habits over the years strongly suggest that Sabbath would have stood more than a fighting chance against the mighty Zeppelin.
0765348276|5.0|Amazing writing, touching and spare.  Takes the best of Starship Troopers and reimagines it through the lense of vintage Vonnegut.  I was actually moved to read parts aloud to my wife -- generally a no-no when genre sci-fi is on the menu.

0618680004|1.0|Every high school student knows that wars and many atrocities have occurred in the name of one religion or another. What Dawkins and those of his ilk ignore is the countless hours of service and humanitarian effort put forth by those of all religions. In my own community, I see dedicated individuals from a variety of belief systems trying to make life better for those who are less fortunate. They do it quietly, not expecting any rewards. Although a religious belief or church, synagog or temple attendance is not typical of all, it is certainly typical of the vast majority. No Mr. Dawkins, the world is a much better place because of those who believe. To paint it otherwise is pure ignorance.
1401302378|2.0|If you've heard about the long tail, you've heard it.    You don't need to go out and buy this book, unless you feel like studying the whole phenemenon (which your teacher might think you should).     To me, it feels like this book was needed to scientifically prove the concept of the Long Tail. That's good, but not something for me. I believe it already.    \\"Find some articles on the long tail\\" would be my personal take on it.

0316067598|5.0|Recommend : DEFINITELY    This book will definitely hold your attention and give you a freshened appreciation for all the servicemen and servicewomen that dedicate their lives to fighting for our country and guaranteeing our freedom. They all definitely make the ultimate sacrifice for every US citizen.    Marcus starts the book off talking about how he got involved with the SEALS and the training he went through. For those of us who have never read about SEAL training, it definitely sets the groundwork for the story of Operation Redwing. You will also get an introduction into the mindset of Al Qaeda, the Taliban and the Afghanistan Pushtan tribe. I really liked the way Marcus intertwined the story of his loved ones back home waiting anxiously for news of his safety with his struggle to stay alive. You become part of the story and ache for everyone involved regardless of who was stateside or who was in Afghanistan.  Marcus reminds of how the view of the fighting person can be very different from those of us who only read about it from news organizations.  Reading about the war from these sources can be very tainted.     I doubt you will regret reading this book because the book easily flows and keeps your attention on what went on. It is also very informative about how the lines of ROE (Rules of Engagement) can be blurry and how our politicians are sacrificing our dedicated armed forces with unreasonable guidelines.    All I can say is Thank You Marcus. Thank You.     And thank you to all the armed forces and families that dedicate their lives ensuring the safety and freedom of the USA.
0141000198|2.0|Ok, the only reason I read this was because I love Pride and Predjucice.  This book was awful, and depressing.  Not funny.   Her life just made my sad, and her family is just pathetic.  Was it meant to be funny?  Ending was really abrupt and hurried, and I kind of wondered how I even got to the end.   Got so sick of hearing how many cigarrettes she had smoked, how many drinks, how many calories.  Oh my goodness.  Enough!
0140157352|5.0|Whatever you do in life this book should be your second bible! It is a short easy read, and will help you deal with every person-to-person interaction in your life. That includes your family life, your social life, and your working life. I am a professional negotiator who has read many other books (some very good and some not so good), and also walked-the-walk in real-life. I keep a copy of this on my night table and still glance through it regularly.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|I pre-ordered and purchased this DVD through Amazon and could not wait for it to arrive. Then I get the movie to see it was three hours long. That was the down point. Took me weeks to \\"find the time\\". I really believe the movie could have been shortened and it would not have hurt the story. We all got the point quickly that the Zodiac was a teaser to his victims, the media and the police. Even though I lived during that time here in California, I had forgotten the fear we all had. I enjoyed seeing the period piece, in a world with no cell phones, computers, faxes and answer machines. I wondered if the Zodiac were committing his crimes in this day and age, if he would have been caught and brought to justice. I enjoyed the movie tremendously but cannot see myself sitting down for another 3 hours and watching the movie over and over.
B000003C5C|5.0|this was Deaths 2nd cd and was leaps and bounds better than their debut. Solid production and awesome songs. The great Chuck S. started using timing/offbeat aspects to the music instead of straight speed giving the disc a dark feel and the solos are excellent here.<br /><br />This would be the beginning of Death's more eccentric music, though nothing compared to 'Sound of Perseverence' this Cd was the start of something special. Chucks vision was much clearer than on 'Scream Bloody Gore'. Guitar wise its pretty straight forward, not nearly as intricate as on later stuff, but the heaviness is there. And the riffs are memorable. The drum sound on this cd is great for its time. Hits hard.<br /><br />Best tracks : Pull the Plug, Left To Die, Open Casket.. But all are really good.  Biggest disapointment is the length and fact that there are only 8 racks.<br /><br />This is a staple, and one of THE essential metal cd's of all time.. Along with Met's 'Ride', Slayers 'Reign' and Kreator's 'Extreme aggressions'. A must for all serious headbangers.
B000001FAS|5.0|There's a lot of people who like to dismiss southern rock without even giving it a chance.  It's really amazing how close-minded people can be.  If they ever heard the Allman Brothers Band (particularly the classic period) they'd grow to appreciate southern rocks best moments.    This is a brilliant band.  It's not often I use the word \\"brilliant\\" because it's a word that only deserves to be used when it's entirely appropriate.  In this case, I feel completely comfortable using it.     I was surprised while listening to Eat a Peach how many songs I had already recognized.  \\"Ain't Wasting Time No More\\" is a perfect blend of rock and blues.  In fact, that's one of the greatest things about this band.  They are really good at knowing how to blend the blues with rock and roll.  \\"Les Brers In a Minor\\" is a great instrumental with a dramatic and intense 3-minute introduction.  It eventually progresses into some highly spectacular instrumental guitar and drums sections.    Everyone knows how beautiful the vocal melody and guitar work sounds on \\"Melissa\\".  The greatest ballad ever written.  \\"Mountain Jam\\" is a ROLLER-COASTER 34-minute jam that even features a drum solo around the halfway point.  The guitar playing is the highlight of the song though- always melodic, exciting and detailed.      \\"One Way Out\\" is a return to blues rock, and this version of \\"Trouble No More\\" rules in the same way as the version on the debut studio album.      \\"Blue Sky\\" is my favorite song on the album.  That's a fact.  The beautiful vocal melody which starts the song and the spectacular guitar jamming immediately afterwards really adds up to one completely satisfying experience.  I dare anyone who claims to hate southern rock to hate this song.  \\"Little Martha\\" is a calm and pretty way to end a near-perfect album.  \\"Stand Back\\" was the only song I didn't recognize before hearing this great album.  Buy it today.
B000002GQG|5.0|Having worn out my original copy of this cd by the Moody Blues, I am thrilled to have it again.  I was fortunate to see the Moodies in concert in Portland recently, and they are better than ever.  Their music is classic Rock and Roll.  My favorite on this set is House of Four Doors.  I plan to see the Moody Blues as often as they play in an area near or in Portland.  They are timeless and their music and playing are wonderful, and...they seem like such nice guys!
B00027JZ3E|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies growing up, so I am thrilled that this DVD edition was released. There's a lot of great interviews and behind-the-scenes tidbits on the bonus disc. The extra with the makeup artist is particularly interesting.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|The highs and lows that come with police investigations are brought out heavily in this movie.  David Fincher was able to bring to the screen a highly regarded film like Fight Club, and now does it again with a detective drama.  Based on the actual serial killer known as \\"Zodiac\\", the movie shows a lot of character development being put to the test as it goes round and round with a variety of people who are involved in the case.  I was displeased to not have any extras on the DVD; I was really expecting some factual footage and interviews that came from the actual files that this story was based on.
0802714544|2.0|The cold in the title is spot on, this story left my cold (purposefully, I'm sure). The characters were either too cynical or had motivations I was unable to sympathize with, like the girl, who was a member of the communist party but in truth just wanted to get a husband. The book was very clear on that, she was as ordinary as it gets. Communists just recited typical communist propaganda, with a touch of nazism once in a while, and were hardly fascinating as the opponents. The ending was unsurprising, because it was obvious that one of two alternatives was true, and it wasn't even possible to admire the cold cleverness of the story. I don't know how it would puzzle anyone, even though the reviews say otherwise. If it had been a true story, at least I would know how espionage was really like. As a work of fiction I couldn't find anything in it to love, the characters or the plot.
1582701709|3.0|I did find some valuable insight from this book, as well as some interesting stories.  I think the \\"Secret\\" is not necessarily a singular thing that one can peg, but a result from a variety of positive things that one does to improve their life and getting great results.  The title brings about a feeling that some think perhaps this is some kind of revelation of sorts, and I suppose if you just found a way to unlock a lot of positive potential within yourself, then it could be taken as such.  I was a bit removed from the examples used in some ways, it seems material possessions such as a car or some other toy you would treat yourself with were used to the point where it makes material possessions seem nobler to attain than anything else.
1594489505|5.0|For me, \\"The Kite Runner\\", Mr. Hosseini's debut novel is one of the best novels I have read. It has one of the most beautiful lines ever (\\"For you, a thousand times over\\"), so powerful, it lingers in the end.     For this sophomore book - seeing that it also gains great reviews - I do have my expectations. I have to admith that it does not achieve the same effect. While the story is better in terms of writing - as Mr. Hosseini is able to write flawlessly between chapters, that reading it becomes so easy - but the power it has for me is not as strong.     Maybe because where \\"The Kite Runner\\" is a story of a man's journey to redemption - to fix what one cowardice thing he did as a child that managed to destroy a life of his best friend - this book is \\"merely\\" a story of two women in trapped marriage, with abusive husband - which in a way can feel a bit \\"soap-opera-dish\\". During the mid-part of the book, the beatings and the abuse become predictable.     However, what makes this book still deserves high recognition (and in this case a five star from me) is the truth of it. This kind of story DOES happen in some part of the world. Maybe even worse - because there is not enough coverage for it from us. Not enough appeal to achieve high ratings, maybe. This is just a glimpse of another real world - where a thousand splendid suns hide behind the wall.     Thus in the end, when my eyes became teary when I close the last chapter of this book, I realize that while it can be melodramatic, but it also opens our eyes that life can be cruel and messy - that sometimes self-sacrifice is a form of salvation and where friendship is a form of hope.     PS: Some scenes here still touch your heart, I am sure. Like the heartwarming, touching, a bit ironic look (maybe) on how people of Kabul fell in love with the movie Titanic.     Recommendation: try to watch the movie Osama, also telling life of a girl in Afghanistan. It will break your heart
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Fracture is a great psychological drama that stars Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.  Fracture is a film with qualities reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock era that really left me guessing until the very end.  Gosling's performance as a young smitten lawyer named Willie Beachum is something to applaud.  I was not impressed when he was cast in a crime thriller called \\"Murder by Numbers\\" with Sandra Bullock a few years ago, but those thoughts are now erased from my memory.  Beachum takes on the case of a successful engineer named Ted Crawford, who is accused of attempted murder.  As the clues become less and less presentable, Beachum suddenly realizes that Crawford is playing some sort of game, and it is a game of chance and elaborate mind games that Beachum just might win.<br /><br />Fracture did not douse me with puzzles, in fact it really held back in that area and yet the continual drama that played out between the two main characters was more than enough to keep me not just guessing, but simply interested in the film's story as a whole.
0757302661|5.0|I had given birth twice & was expecting my third when I got this book. It really is a low price considering it includes the cd & book! I will be honest & say I never read the whole book & didn't have much time to listen to the cd but I listened a handful of times while pregnant.<br /><br />My husband didn't take part in the cd or the exercises in the book. So it can be done without them following along.<br /><br />The first time I gave birth naturally it was a very traumatic & painful experience. It was something I never again wanted to feel. The second time went much smoother. It was another natural birth as my epidural couldn't be given in time. My labors are normally long (14 1/2 & 20 1/2 hours long) I normally need pitocin because I stop dialating naturally around 5 cm.<br /><br />My water broke & I started practicing my breathing in the car. I could tell it was working because I went from feeling no pain to a good amount of pain & was afraid we wouldn't make it to the hospital in time so I stopped practicing. We got to the hospital at 2:15A I was expecting to need pitocin which I did not want! Around 3 I was 6 cm. Then at 4:03A I was 10 I couldn't even believe I had done it on my own. My son all 9 lbs & 21 inches was born by 4:17A with no medication at all.<br /><br />I won't lie & say it was pain free but it was a lot less painful than my other med free births.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|The Final Cut was aptly named as it marked the departure of founding bass player Roger Waters.  Void of the effort shown in the past towards the artistic album covers, this alone maybe was a sign that times were changing.<br /><br />The entire album seems more like a concept album unto itself, with Roger's vocals echoing on in a shouting stance at a world gone awry.  Perhaps the most overlooked aspect of this album is the true psychedelic sound the lies within the songs themselves.  This in itself is kind of ironic, as it seems on his final studio recording with the band Roger was trying to take them back to their roots.  Many times it seems to be an ongoing dream getting gobbled up by a nightmare, with Tom standing in the middle of it trying to...make sense of it all.  The result however, is nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />The World War II aspect can still be felt throughout, creating ominous tones that stay with the listener far after the last song has ended.  A much overlooked album that features the final, collective farewell of some of the greatest musicians of our time.<br /><br />S.H. Murray
1881273156|5.0|Have you ever said that as you read a self-improvement book?  I should have known this?  I said that sooooo many times as I read this book. This in another book I share with my students who are having relationship difficulties.  I also recommend it for anyone in a relationship!  You can learn so much about yourself and your partner and take the relationship to the next level.  Great read and highly recommended.
0471267554|4.0|This is one of the few diet books that actually make sense to me--it focuses on how our bodies were meant to eat, and what we're genetically programmed to process.  There are no magic tricks, no \\"fat burning miracles,\\" no tricks, no drugs, no 30-days-to-a-new-you, just solid, and (to me) sensible and easy to follow guidelines.<br /><br />The book emphasizes fresh foods, rather than processed--that makes sense and avoids who knows what chemical additives.  Lean meat, healthful oils, fish or seafood, fresh vegetables and fruits--simple.  No need to try to interpret complex labels, count calories, carbs, or whatever.  Just lean meats, fresh vegetables and fruits.<br /><br />This is not to say you have to eat all game meats and raw vegetables and fruits to benefit--you can adapt many of your favorite recipes and snacks and even eat out, if you pay attention to what you're ordering.<br /><br />As the author of The Wild Foods Cookbook for Stephen Greene Press [[ASIN:0828907129 The Wild foods Cookbook]]in the early 90s, I'm delighted to find how often this book parallels my own research.  Again, no need to forage as our ancestors did--with care, we can shop at our local supermarket or farmer's market.<br /><br />Cordain's not the world's greatest writer, and he tends to repeat his points more than I really enjoy, but the basic tenets are easy to grasp, make sense, and make me, personally, feel very good.<br /><br />The book has a section of great recipes and appendices, solid research, and personal success stories...this one, at least, doesn't feel like a fad diet.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Originally released in 1974, &#34;The Towering Inferno&#34; stands as one of the best of the 70's disaster films.  This film like many of Allen's others including &#34;The Poseiden Adventure&#34; is jam-packed with special effects and stars including:  Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astare, Susan Blakley, Jennifer Jones, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner and even O.J. Simpson.<br /><br />Paul Newman as the architect designs the world's tallest and safest skyscraper.  The developer, William Holden, shaves cost by cheating on the electrical system barely staying within the electrical codes.<br /><br />The Grand Opening party for the new building with guests such as the Mayor, a Senator and many other important locals becomes a disaster.  Electrical overloads and short circuits cause a fire half way up the building.  Of course the party is on the top floor, approximately 50 stories above the fire.  As the fire spreads, Steve McQueen as the Fire Chief comes to the rescue.  If you want to know how it ends, you'll have to watch it!<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone who loves action and suspense.  A 2-disc offering many extras, it is a sure bet for your video collection.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Its too bad they don't make mini-series anymore. Lonesome Dove is an amazing example of what is possible in the genre.
1594489505|5.0|As I write, there are already 542 reviews for A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS: 413 of which are 5-starred, and 74 4-starred.  Looking at those figures, it's obvious you the reader don't need yet another long review praising this novel and its author.  Allow me, however, to say that I loved Hosseini's KITE RUNNER, but I enjoyed A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS more. It's an emotionally powerful and disturbing story that should leave you thinking of these two women and on their sad lot in life long after you've finished the book.  It certainly had that affect on me.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini's first two novels (and I hope there will be many more) give a voice to those who suffer the most in war: the women and the children.
B000ROALCG|4.0|I thought the movie was excellent.  I can't thionk of anyone else I would like to play the part of this legend.  My only criticism off the top of my head was the movie did not fully articulate the crushing emotions Hector must have felt from the various tragedies in his life.  As for the soundtrack the only critism would be as other reviewers have pointed out.  Anthony (while a master in his own right) tries to emulate the strongest part of another master's game.  While Anthony's versions of these songs are pretty awesome you can't and shouldn't compare them to Lavoe's.  I would imagine that Anthony did not put his own spin on these classics more out of respect to and his devotion to portraying Lavoe in the same light and style as Lavoe is remembered.  I am happy Anthony pursued this project and would love to hear in his words how he approached it.
6305428425|5.0|Romy and Michele's High School Reunion is such a guilty pleasure. This movie is cute and oh so true. Romy and Michele have been best friends since high school and so when their 10th high school reunion shows up, they decide to make themselves seem important to their mean classmates. Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino defintely have the acting chops to pull off such ditzy and pathetic characters, but you root for them and want them to succeed. This film has it all, likeable leads, completely original story, and great '80s music. I highly recommend this movie, you'll love it!
B000LXH0AE|3.0|I'm all for originality, which was one of the only things this movie had going for it. I was glad the narration mostly ceased after the movie started, because it rapidly became annoying.<br /><br />Will Ferrell had his funny moments, and the story was fine, the movie just seemed to drag. This movie would have been much tighter with about 20 - 30 minutes trimmed.<br /><br />Queen Latifah's role was underwhelming. Her character had a few meaningless lines and that entire subplot was a waste of space. Not sure why they even bothered with her role.<br /><br />In all, this was an okay movie. It gets 3 stars instead of 2 because of its originality, but this was never laugh out loud funny, nor something that you could watch over and over.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Lost - The Complete Third Season started off so-so but finished with a bang! I think Matthew Fox should've received an Emmy nomination for his riveting and heartbreaking performance in the season finale, how good is he?! Although we the fans have to wait 'til next February to see what happened, I can't wait because I think the fourth season will probably be the best, more twist and turns just ahead for the passengers of Oceanic Flight 815. Of course there were some casualties this season, we lost some great cast members, and what's with Juliet's face? The muscles in her face don't move? Can you say botox junkie!  My fave character is John Locke played by the extraordinary Terry O'Quinn, in flashbacks the long-kept secret of how Locke got into that wheelchair was finally revealed, it was a brilliant episode. I highly recommend buying season 3. Enjoy!
0060934719|4.0|I'm a first time Neil Gaiman reader, and though I love his subjects, his writing style takes a little getting used to. I do love this book and highly recommend it, the four stars are only because of the \\" how did they get there, who is that, oh well I accept it\\" style of writing, which in hindsight is kind of cool, some books spend several chapters on back stories, and Neil just wants to get to the point. Maybe that comes from starting with comics and then short stories. Still a great story none the less.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Not an awful dvd, not too many features, but for the price its good quality and a great movie. Definitely worth it!
B000P2A256|3.0|I was really looking forward to this CD, because I loved that last one. But I was very disappointed the first couple times I listened to it. It's very different, in that his songs seem more mellow. It seems like he's been through a tough relationship, and all the fun and games from the first cd are over. Almost every song on the last cd were great, but there are only a few good songs on this one. Almost better to purchase just the songs you want instead of wasting money on this whole cd.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Finally a new singer - who can sing! How novel in today's music scene with its toy barbies - girls and boys - spitting trash for cash - to see a developing artist make records his children will not be ashamed of, and neither will we when we turn this one up! GO GO PAOLO!
B00006RAKP|5.0|I got into Elton a couple years ago, and since I didn't have any of his stuff, I started out with this cd. It's great!! I could listen to it over and over again. The last few songs I'm not too fond of, but that's only because I'm not crazy about his newer stuff.
0316776963|5.0|I am a huge Sedaris fan.  This is one of his best.  I just couldn't help giggling and laughing out loud like a fool.   People looked at me like I was nuts on the train as I read it.  I didn't care, because it is so poignant and funny, so real!  Even better, when I can hear his voice in my head, check out his audio books.  He's perfect reading his own work.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I could not disagree more with the negative reviews of this album.  It is an incredibly tender and subtle work that continues to reveal itself over time.  I love the 70's rock pallet that Wilco employs on many of the songs and the lyrics are touching and inspiring.  The music explains itself to the attentive listener, but I must address the critics of the lyrics.    Jeff Tweedy is responsible for some of my favorite lyrics over the years and the thing I love most about Sky Blue Sky is his emotional progression as an artist.  Sky Blue Sky is the other side of Jeff's frequently depressed and dark lyrics.  Where once he wrote \\"I know that I would die if I could come back new\\"  he now writes \\"Either way, I'm gonna stay right for you.\\"  This is not to say that Tweedy has become an overly-hopeful cheese ball.  Perhaps the most touching moment on the album is when he sings, \\"I should warn you when I'm not well, I can't tell.\\"  It is Tweedy's ability to take a discussion of the individual's lack of self awareness during bouts of mental illness and refine the truth down to a single sentence.    One thing I will mention about the music is the cohesion of the band - It reaches new heights.  Many of the Wilco projects could be better described as Jeff Tweedy and Friends.  This is simply not the case with Sky Blue Sky. Tweedy is still the captain but every member of his crew is essential to the musical journey and they are each clearly a part of the song crafting.    To be fair, Wilco has yet to make what I would consider a perfect album, but then again, few artist ever have.  What Sky Blue Sky achieves however, is a subtle blend of honesty and maturity expressed by a group of musicians who clearly enjoy making music together.

B000089RV6|4.0|I never really dug ACDC - the vocals were literally torture, and I really couldn't handle the existentialist-theological ramifications of...\\"stuff\\" like the hideously-blasphemous \\"Highway To Hell.\\"  So I wasn't really prepared in 1980 when my ex and her then husband put \\"Back In Black\\" in their car's cassette-player thing. Blah-blah-blah-\\"Oh, they have a new vocalist,\\" \\"You oughta see Angus,\\" blah-blah-blah...I was all set to militantly ignore \\"Black,\\" when I made the...\\"chance remark\\" that \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" wasn't a bad title at ALL for a song.  Beloved Ex played it for me, and later that evening, when the husband-du-jour had imbibed too much and had written himself out of the \\"scenerio,\\" She and I played \\"Noise Pollution\\" until we knew it note-for-note.  STILL don't have much use for the band, but that one song is...ALMOST \\"redemption\\" for that \\"Highway\\" thing - and it's damn fun to play & perform.  I was greatly disappointed, though, when whoever-edited-the-thing didn't include the band's performance of it at that \\"Rolling Stones In Toronto\\" thing.  Oh yeah, 8/15, I did forget to mention that one of their earlier \\"songs,\\" \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\" is wonderful, too.  Actually helped me get thru a divorce one time, but let's not quibble...

0345494997|5.0|Horan's novel of the romance between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Cheney is altogether absorbing and fascinating.  It's a credit to the author that this reader could almost sympathize with the great love that tore apart two families.

0143038419|4.0|This book was right up my alley.  I love Italy, have my own limited knowledge about India, and know next to nothing about Bali/Indonesia.  Liz Gilbert takes you on her own journey to learn more about herself.  This book is really about self discovery, not about learning about the rest of the world.  Liz Gilbert uses the world as a mirror to more clearly see herself, very successfully.<br /><br />Not to give too much of the book away, but her entire year long trip is precipitated by a painful divorce and the realization that she is not truly happy in the life she is currently living.  She wants to seek an inner peace.  Her trip to Italy is one of self indulgence, her trip to India represents learning self awareness, and her trip to Bali is really the gift of self forgiveness.  Her descriptions of the characters she meets are hilarious and wonderful.  You envy her for all of the new friends she makes during her travels.<br /><br />Liz writes in a very honest manner, and is often funny, often poignant.  I laughed and chuckled, as well as shed a tear or two (mosty happy ones, though).  Here and there she will say something like \\"I was the only one I ever knew who felt this way\\" and I am sure many readers will quickly recognize that she is mistaken!  But the book is honest, and if she felt alone in her feelings of morbidity or in being unsettled and not having direction, at least she doesn't sugar-coat it or place blame.  She is clearly a flawed human and she gives it all up to God (or whatever you want to call Him/Her/It) in this book  That's why I enjoyed reading her.  It was sincere.  Very enjoyable.  This is a good one, and made for smooth compelling reading.  Well done.

B00005JPAO|1.0|As with my Sin City movie review, I know that I am going to get crushed by my one star rating, especially with all the awards and press this movie has gotten, but here goes, my opposition review.    Basically, the whole flow of this movie feels like a bad TV soap opera drama, where pretty much nothing happens except people talking on their phone in their studies.  The whole sweep of the film is very, very clunky.  A lot of the sets feel very, very staged and cheap.  Seriously, there are a lot of British television shows that are a lot smoother, and less slow in pace.    As far as plot, you take an historical event that was extremely tabloid to begin with, and then try to fit it into the pace and style of a quiet British drama, and apparently the clash of cultures is supposed to make it look interesting.  It fails to clash in this regard, it looks like two separate movies.    As far as acting is concerned, Helen Mirren has done a better and more dynamic job in other films.  Yeah, this is not designed to be a dynamic role anyways, the Queen of England.  My opinion is this - it really doesn't take a lot of effort to display stoicism and lack of emotion across an entire movie.  The rest of the cast is really iffy as well- even James Cromwell.  And what's up with Tony Blair's  lips?  Too much makeup?    The sad thing is that I am the type of reviewer that generally likes this sort of film - I tend to steer away from heavy action and adventure and prefer drama.   I also would like to say that I don't really have a strong opinion on the British constitutional monarchy either, though this movie's plot is so lacking it never really gets to the deeper issues.      Go watch a nice British mystery drama instead.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|This movie came out when I was two and it's been my favorite for 20 years.   It is most definitely a MUST see for anyone who enjoys fantasy and fun, as well as anyone who enjoys a glammed-out Bowie in tight pants.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|_Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb_ (1964) is a darkly comic and disturbing film directed by Stanley Kubrick.  The film is regarded by many as one of the greatest classics of all time and satirizes the ludicrousness of such notions as Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D.) and the horrors of nuclear war.  The film was made during the height of Cold War hysteria and shows the sheer lunacy and idiocy of the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union in their attempts to build ever greater weapons of mass destruction.  The film also shows the lunacy of scientists and generals who operate behind the scenes and plan to unleash these weapons upon an unwitting populace.  The film is meant to be a black comedy and thus features many absurd components which serve only to re-inforce in the mind of the viewer the horrible matters being presented in such a light-hearted manner.    The movie begins with the lunacy of General Jack D. Ripper, who believes in a communist conspiracy to destroy the \\"bodily fluids\\" of the American people through fluoridated water.  Ripper decides to strike the Soviet Union with a nuclear attack and manages to do so without the authorization of the president by making use of a special emergency plan known as \\"Plan R\\".  The film then focuses on the men flying the plane which is set on unleashing this weapon upon the Russians, showing the conflicts that develop between them.  The film also features Peter Sellers playing Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, who serves as an important executive under General Ripper and tries to dissuade him from the attack.  The film then focuses on a special meeting of the president and his generals in the \\"War Room\\".  (One particularly humorous and memorable line from the movie occurs when the president makes the comment to one of his generals and the Russian ambassador that there is to be \\"no fighting in the War Room\\".)  The president notifies the Russians of the attack in an effortto thwart the attack and thus prevent a full scale and destructive nuclear war through the Russian ambassador.  Unfortunately, as it turns out, the Soviets have devised a \\"doomsday device\\" which upon the destruction of their own missiles will completely obliterate all life on earth.  Thus, the president must attempt to call back the U.S. aircraft which plan on unleashing this destruction before it is too late.  The film also features Peter Sellers as the Nazi mad scientist Dr. Strangelove who periodically alternates between giving the Nazi salute and addressing the president as \\"Mein Furher\\" and \\"Mein President\\".  Dr. Strangelove explains to the president how the doomsday device is to work and also offers up the possibility of an escape by a few selected people who will live under the earth in mines.  It should be pointed out that Dr. Strangelove is believed to be an amalgamation of the ex-Nazi scientist Werner von Braun and Edward Teller, the inventor of the hydrogen bomb.  The film ends in a very disturbing manner as this terror is unleashed upon the world.    This film remains an essential classic and is ranked by many as among the greatest of all times.  The message of the film is quite disturbing in that it shows how mass lunacy may break out and a nuclear war result.  Through the actions of madmen within the United States military and government, a nuclear war is made inevitable.  For those who lived under constant threat of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, such a possibility was a distinct reality.  Thus, while the film attempts to make light of this issue, underlying this humor is an all-too-disturbing reality.  This film is to be highly recommended to all thoughtful people who struggle with the notion that individuals in power continue to wield weapons of mass destruction and that they may be unleashed upon nations at any time.  While the Cold War is supposedly over, such weapons still exist and their reality remains all-too-apparent.    Highly recommended!
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Michael is maturing as a performer. Each album seems to be a bit better than the last, unlike Harry Connick, Jr. who can't seem to make up his mind what style he likes best.    \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" is particularly good.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|I cringe with fear the so-called new Beatles releases that pour out every Xmas. Anthology was a mix match of gems and also rejected stuff. The BBC anthology was so so. Like Elvis, the Beatles is the most recycled group ever.<br /><br />I like this one. Although there is technically nothing new hear, the remixes give the Beatles, a fresh new Moulin Rogue sound. The recordings sound fresh and not old.<br /><br />If Elvis can be remixed for the dance floor, some clever guy at EMI should do it. Allons-y!

B0009VRHLK|1.0|Chloë Sevigny is a very talented actress. What is she doing in this movie?<br /><br />I was given this DVD as a gift after I very foolishly gave Roger Ebert's latest book, \\"Your Movie Sucks,\\" to a fellow film buff. Ebert and Gallo had extremely heated exchanges about this film, which Ebert loathed. Ebert was right to loathe it, and apparently this is a more streamlined, better edited, version than the viewers at Cannes had to endure. I pity the French.<br /><br />The story concerns Gallo as motorcycle racer Bud Clay, as he drives in a van from one coast to the other. Of the 93 minute running time, probably a good 70 minutes are nothing but shots of the road taken from the van. There is one exciting scene in which we get to see Gallo take his bike out of the van and run it at high speed across the Bonneville Salt Flats. While that would ordinarily be boring, it livens up this movie. Gallo is haunted by an anguished relationship with Daisy, the love of his life, played by Sevigny. The actual resolution of the disparate plot points at the end of the movie partially redeems the film, although the controversial scene immediately preceding that wrap up, which evidently involves a stand in (of sorts) for Gallo, isn't worth all the fuss. By that point I was just screaming \\"End...End!\\" in futility at the television.<br /><br />Along his journey, Gallo meets three other women, Violet, Lilly, and Rose. Nothing furthering the plot happens with any of these women, they are there simply to demonstrate Gallo's generalized angst about romantic relationships, and possibly to demonstrate his love of horticulture given their obvious floral monikers. (I'm sure it is no coincidence that Gallo's character name is Bud, an immature flower...) I thought the women were all quite good in their roles. Sevigny was strong as Daisy, Cheryl Tiegs is good as a silent lost soul at a rest stop, and Anna Vareschi was great as Violet, the gas station attendant. I thought that Mary Morasky as Daisy's mother was excellent and provided just the right amount of pathos in a difficult scene.<br /><br />This excremental movie is amongst the most boring things ever made. I didn't so much hate this movie as I was relentlessly bored by it. It is oddly framed (how many close-ups of Gallo's ungroomed sideburns do we really need?), in dire need of severe editing, and generally amateurish in every respect except for the acting in the female roles. The final ten minutes do provide some thematic enlightenment, but by then it's too late to save.<br /><br />I have learned two lessons from this movie. First, if Roger Ebert says that something is awful, pay close attention; second, I really should be careful who I send Ebert's books to.d provided just the right amount of pathos in a difficult scene.

0393316041|5.0|I guess for a grad student this book is inspirational. It gives guidelines on how research should be done, how to not just \\"believe\\" blindly others work, but to try and understand it and prove it yourself. It also points out what is wrong with the way we are taught to think, learn in school, by our teachers. It shows how superficial people are in thinking, and how they prefer just to take things as they are and not think them through!!!
B00009UW0N|3.0|This movie ended me crying!!  The man loves the woman so much that he pretends to be trickster and goes to her house in a stars trek mask.  He waits for most of movie to see her for the right timing.  It is tricky some of the times because you are in his mask or next to him in the bushes, or sometimes walking up the stairs of the house!  It was sad to me for even his woman love is scared of him, just like the dragon monster who made friends with the village people in a learning book.  Maybe he was not as good looking and that is why they were yelling with wire hangers and guns.  It made me sad - they shoot him and he ran away crying!!  I felt very scared by the bald man - he has big eyes that look like cartoon bird!  If he look at me, I run too; very fast and many times away!!  Keep running, trickster with love - I have two stars treat for you!!! (the movie only gets three stars because of meanness)
0596527055|3.0|I'm a huge fan of [[ASIN:0596007868 The Art of Project Management (Theory in Practice (O'Reilly))]] by Berkun and followed the development of The Myths of Innovation on his blog. Unfortunately, I still got the purpose of this book wrong. I was expecting more of a tutorial on how one should innovate and come up with new ideas. The book instead tries to debunk certain myths of innovation, and certainly does a good job at that.    Berkun has some interesting things to say, and I enjoyed reading the book. The cons were still pretty obvious, Berkun tries to keep the book short but I would like to have seen more examples of how these myths are upheld. The examples used were too often about the same companies or individuals, e.g. Apple, Steve Jobs and Microsoft.    All in all, I recommend reading the book, but would have liked to see a bit more content.
B00000J6AG|5.0|this album is a classic in the chillout / atmospheric genre. fusing blues riffs and electronic meanderings .Moby is definitelly a great talented musician.
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|I remember the first time I actually heard a Behemoth album. I was perusing through the Metal section in a local record store when I came across their area. I was initially intrigued by the name and album covers. The name Behemoth invokes something incredibly massive, powerful, ancient and crushing and their album covers depict ancient and mystical pictures that are both fascinating and frightening at the same time.     The album I ended up purchasing would turn out to be a compilation of their old style, basically it was a mix of studio and live tracks of what they \\"used\\" to sound like. You know, back in the old days of the crappy Corpse paint that was drawn horribly and super uber pale skin mixed with young adolescent boys. This, coupled with horrid vocals and shoddy instrumentation made me hate Behemoth for the longest time.   Their old style was a more traditional Black Metal offering that will Literally put you to sleep with its boring demeanor and style.    Then, one day I read some reviews of Demigod and I was instantly intrigued yet again. I read how they had changed their style and added much more technical elements to their music.   Not to mention their album cover picture was way cool and their song titles seemed to delve into a more esoteric form than their earlier work. I picked up Demigod and was blown away by this massive powerhouse of an album that is so relentless and brutal that you will be begging for more.    Demigod presents a completely different style than previous Behemoth albums. Instead of a straight Black Metal onslaught of boring, they bring forth a mesh of all sorts of metal to form a very exciting, frantic and sometimes chaotic whole. Think Black Metal mixed with Death Metal, Eastern Melodies and gynormus, monstrous riffs and even deeper, darker more sinister vocals than before!   Add to this mix a whole slew of esoteric and occult laden lyrics that deal with ancient Gods and the like, and I was hooked!    The musicianship of these guysis out of this world! Their drummer, Inferno, is AMAZING! Some of the most technical and complex drumming I have ever heard, next in line to Nile. The guitars shred through time and space with crushing riffs, speedier solos and at times eerie melodies.   These riffs are true Behemoths of sound and you will oft find yourself pummeled under their awesome power and size.  Bass is all but non existent, probably looming somewhere deep in the background (too bad being that I am a bass player myself and would love to hear more metal where the bass is more prominent)  Another great thing about Demigod, is the acoustic break downs that are littered throughout this album. They are drenched in Eastern Melodies and provide a nice break from the relentless onslaught of HEAVY, INTENSE music.    Nergal's vocals are menacing, dark, evil and the deepest gutteral imaginable (close to Mikael Akerfelt from Opeth/Bloodbath fame) - the best kind. Though it would be nice to hear some clean sung vocals (IMHO), that would be going way to far. I mean, seriously, this guy can growl! It sounds like he is summoning the energies of Baal and Moloch all at once!    The lyrics are steeped in spell craft, ancient Gods, esoteric beliefs and other such mysteries, and they work really well! The lyrics are the main reason that I am in love with Demigod. I love lyrics that deal with issues other than death, politics, love and war. These lyrics serve all of my esoteric fantasies and wonders. Though I would recommend you find the lyrics and read along while listening. I found it extremely difficult to understand what he is actually saying.    Demigod isn't without its fault though, and for me this manifests in the form of repetition. The vocals, while heavy, brutal and awesome get a little grating and boring after a while. Like I said, it would be nice if Nergal would embrace his soft side and throw in a little singing or some kind of variation once in a while. Listening to almost an hour of constant deepdeath growls gets kind of..well...boring.  This is the thing that I have never understood about metal bands. Constant screaming throughout each and every song is so mundane nowadays.    The technical musical approach can get tedious at times too. Sometimes I like to hear some simple, back-to-basics instrumentation intermixed with technically complex music. Its all about balance. Demigod shows a leaning toward more of the heavy technical side with little of the acoustic break downs, but its well worth it. You WILL find enjoyment in Demigod.    These two gripes are most likely my own, and even though I find these two things to be annoying, I LOVE this album and would recommend it to all metal lovers.
B000005ZGZ|5.0|there's no Margin Walker, no Repeater, no Great Cop.  but as far as albums go, from beginning to end, this one has become my favorite over time.  now, if someone asked me \\"who is this band 'Fugazi' and what do they sound like?\\" i wouldn't choose anything from this record as an introduction to the band, opting for something easily accessible like Waiting Room or Blueprint instead.  but End Hits is amazing, it just takes a little longer to realize it.  My favorite track, Recap Modotti, sounds like Polvo at their very best (listen to it again and tell me it wouldn't fit right in on Exploded Drawing).  I think the overall mood of the album is akin to Steady Diet... but I think they surpass that record here; whereas SDoN had the feel of a band still stretching its legs and forging their identity, End Hits is the sound of a band confident in their sound while putting their musical (and lyrical) chops to the test.  While more subtle than excellent predecessor Red Medicine, this record is not w/out rocking tracks, like the anthemic  Place Position and Five Corporations.  Fugazi also has a knack for writing fantastic instrumentals, and here they add Arpeggiator to classics like Sweet and Low(one of my favorite songs ever) and Brendon #1.  End Hits won't grab you by the throat like the earlier releases, but if you invest three or four listens to it, you'll find the rewards were definitely worth the time.
B000002G23|4.0|I know this box is the \\"complete\\" recordings. But some reviewers have mentioned how a few things have been left out. I'm also just wondering here..the last track on disc 4 for is \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me 86\\". Is this the same version from the \\"Every breath you take, the classics\\"? From internet downloads, the version from the box is over 6 mins long. The one from \\"every breath you take the classics\\" is under 5. Just curious. Sometimes internet downloads are incorrect. Any info would be nice.
B000F1IQMS|5.0|This is the greatest movie I have ever seen(good will hunting close 2nd). I knew about the events that transpired in munich 1972, my mother would occassionally bring it up as I was growing up. Nothing in this world has made and brought me closer to Israel and being proud to be a jew than this movie. The love for there country and to take a mission like this, basically to give up their lives or the only lives they knew for the protection and future of there country. Others may not grasp the concept that Israel is the only Jewish Country in the World, There are numerous Christian and Islamic countries. Theconflict alone of this movie made it great, it was much more complex in the character development and plot, and the rest of the story made it incredible. Should have clearly been the academy award winner for best picture over Crash at the 2006 academy awards. I don't really like to write movie reviews, but every so often a movie comes around like this that it's too great not to be mentioned. This review will be listed under my mothers name, I am her son, Michaol Lucka writing this review
0374105235|3.0|This book started out slow with much repition of the battles and hiding in the brush. Then when Ishmael got to the rehabilitation center it began to speed up - to the point where the ending seemed like he just wanted to finish the book. There was not explination of how he got to New York or what happened when he got there. I would have appreciated a better pulling together of the ending of the story.  It's a very powerful book to read - but it just stopped!
0192802631|5.0|I hold very firmly to the belief that this book cannot be fully appreciated in a first reading.  It is necessary to read it at least twice, and preferably more.<br /> It's not as immediately pleasing as some of Ms. Austen's other works, Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility etc., but those who take the time to appreciate this book will find it well worth the effort.

You can expect quite a bit more from each one when you view it without these edits....  And they are both worth the extra $$...Flop status only reflects that mainstream viewers are unable to appreciate good cult film-making. You got 2 movies for the price of 1 in the theatre, isn't that enough for you? Grow up...
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Disclaimer: Sorry! This review is neither a smear critic nor a bipartisan analysis of U.S. politics. You can find that in several of the other reviews below. If such is your interest, you may skip this review.<br /><br />In all fairness, I think the review of Gore's documentary must be divided in two separate parts, the public message delivery and the accuracy of the science he presented in AIT. The latter discussion is aimed only for those with objective and genuine interest in the reliability of the facts and science presented by Gore.<br /><br />---AIT as a mean for environmental awareness---<br />Without a doubt, AIT achieved its purpose. The product is an excellent means for raising public awareness about the importance of taking care of our Pale Blue Dot, particularly for Global Warming (GW), and a welcomed sermon for the converted. The sales pitch is so good that my guess is that even some of those of the doubtful will at least pay more attention to the environmental movement. Gore explicitly tried to use Carl Sagan's style for delivering complex science to the public in simple terms, even with several references to Sagan's work in the opening of AIT. But whether you like it or not, Sagan never exaggerated the scientific facts, and when extrapolating or making educated guesses, he explicitly said so. This is a minor sin that in principle may be forgivable, because the message delivery in AIT uses all the typical resources of public awareness campaigns, such us oversimplification, exaggeration of the facts, alarmism, catastrophic prophecies to create fear, and putting unrelated facts together (this was a repeated offender in AIT, such as tropical diseases unrelated to GW -Ebola, Nile Virus, etc-, or talking about future rising sea levels and immediately illustrating flooding all over the world with an estimate of an outdated worst-case scenario of the 90s). You find all these elements in public campaigns such as anti-tobacco, DUI and drugs awareness, and HIV/AIDS prevention, etc. These public awareness messages usually don't go into the accurate scientific details because not everybody will understand, the message will be confusing, and so, the delivery has to be strong, clear and simple. This approach has proved effective to modify individual behavior. Al Gore unquestionably achieved that. The film director dealt quite properly to make a PowerPoint presentation into an interesting and dynamic documentary, making sure that not everybody will fall asleep. To complete the package, the DVD has an update on GW, and even a errata (regarding the frequency of hurricanes).<br /><br />The capital sin regarding the message delivery has to do with Gore's insistence on putting personal facts, and even worst, the flashback to the 2000 Election. The message for Americans should have not been bipartisan at all; there Gore lost an important audience, and woke up old quarrels, perfectly reflected by many of the reviews below. Gore couldn't resist the mistake of politicizing science. Unfortunately, an important issue like Global Warming ends up being discussed with name-calling, insults, smearing and no criticism is allowed. The issue is being debated as if it was a political or religious issue. It became us against them. It's a shame you don't have the right to disagree or ask any question, especially when we are talking about science, which paradoxically, welcomes and depends on skepticism and criticism to separate good science from bogus science. As Carl Sagan used to say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Thus, in science, the burden of the proof is on those making the claim, regardless of political beliefs. And this concept is valid also for the theory of Global Warming, yes theory! GW theory is far from having solid scientific bases to allow making accurate predictions, such it is possible in astronomy, rocket science or even engineering in general. There are still plenty of uncertainties, and climate scientists are just more comfortable with the present state of knowledge and improvements made during the last ten years. But as explained below, GW is still a work in progress.<br /><br />Instead of the embarrassing blunder of politicizing GW, Gore lost the opportunity to use film time in making more explicit and explaining in detail the US responsibility and unbalanced contribution to atmospheric pollution. Americans represent 4,6% of the world population but produce 30% of the greenhouse gases, and about a third of it just coming from transportation. Just auto travel alone represents 90% of all trips in the US. At least more time could have been used to explain how to mitigate this problem. But, deepening in this subject is definitively not politically convenient. Unpopular measures definitively won't win an election. These measures might include rising the driving age to 18; increasing parking and auto related taxes; charging tolls for entering downtown at peak periods (such as London and Singapore already do); improvement and incentives for using mass transit; and heavy investment for serious research and development of new environmentally friendly fuels. Gore could have mentioned that Brazil already has a viable ethanol market for autos including the option of flexible cars (working on any combination of alcohol and gasoline) and without subsidies for the farmers. Unfortunately, as Joseph Stiglitz said in this latest book, Making Globalization Work, \\"...those who pollute the most always tend to minimize the problem. It is not surprising that the world's polluter, the United States ... pretends that it does not believe the evidence that there is a need to curtail its greenhouse gas emissions.\\"  And let's not forget that the private use of automobiles creates other social problems, for the economy (time and money lost in traffic congestion) and in the health sector (death and injured people from traffic accidents, and respiratory diseases caused by air pollution from cars). Since the seventies, there is plenty of research, papers and recommendations for mitigating the problem, but auto travel is so convenient!<br /><br />---The accuracy of the science in AIT---<br />A quick review of the state-of-the-art on GW and climate change (UN's IPCC 2007 Report and others sources) shows that even though climate models and climate predictions have improved a lot since the 90s, and there is consensus by most climate scientists regarding these predictions, \\"...Confidence in these estimates is higher for some climate variables (e.g. temperature) than for others (e.g. precipitation)\\". Climate is a non-linear system, difficult to deal with and naturally some uncertainties remains. These uncertainties and contradictory measurements can be group on four issues: (i) limited existing data sets available show that temperature in the interior of the Antarctica continent has actually been declining in the last few years and that the ice sheet is getting thicker (yes!, check on Gore's companion book). Simulation biases have been found  by IPCC in most models' simulation of the Southern Ocean (Antarctica). Since the Southern Ocean is important for ocean heat uptake, this results in some uncertainty in transient climate response (simple translation: how the temperature will change due to CO2 increase); (ii) any simulation model has limitations, and in the case of GW, you also have the challenge to make predictions to establish how to world (population, technology, economy, etc.) is going to be a 100 years from now in order to estimate future CO2 emissions. The pool of 18 climate models reviewed by the IPCC showed weaknesses or larger than desirable margins of errors, mainly on estimating rain precipitation in extreme events, and more important, in understanding cloud and ice masses feedbacks (reflection of radiation), all key factors for accurate climate predictions and warming of the atmosphere; (iii) there is still debate about the interpretation of the dataoriginated from the ice core taken at Antarctica, at a better resolution scale the data seems to indicate that during the 650 K years shown by Gore's presentation, temperatures went up first and the CO2 increase followed as a consequence of the higher temperature, and not the opposite; if that is the case, then this data set is not compatible with the modern CO2 increment; and (iv) AIT presented increases in sea level corresponding to the simulation models of the 90's, now known for a tendency to overestimate the effects of GW, the new IPPC Report presents more moderate forecasts on future sea levels due to GW, just a fraction of those presented by Gore.<br /><br />Due to the space limits, I will just go into detail on one of the key uncertainty factors. The following is taken from the IPPC 2007 Report. Cloud feedbacks have been confirmed as a primary source of differences in climate models predictions, particularly in the tropical regions: \\"Cloud feedback is the coupling between cloudiness and surface air temperature in which a change in surface air temperature could lead to a change in volume of clouds, which could then amplify or diminish the initial temperature perturbation. This effect is currently known to have a negative impact on the climate system. However, a changing climate may involve changes in the clouds with both positive and negative effects on the radiative balance. It is not known whether the overall effect of cloud feedback will become a negative or positive feedback, depending on whether and how cloud cover changes. Cloud feedback could almost halve or double the surface air temperature\\" And for those skeptical, a lot of research is underway to better understand the cloud feedbacks. Check through the web, NASA's Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4) field campaign just concluded a few days ago. \\"Many facets of the chemical, dynamic, and physical processes occurring in the tropical upper troposphere and tropopause transitional layer are not well understood. Identifying the key processes in this region is essential for progress on issues involving global climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and global tropospheric chemistry\\". This research was conducted on July and August, 2007, based on Costa Rica, and included also Colombia, Ecuador and Panama. The TC4 Costa Rican campaign used 7 NASA satellites and 3 NASA aircraft.<br /><br />Climate is a complex system we still don't fully understand, but we have much to loose by not taking action now. It would just be nice if the real facts were presented, with associated risks, uncertainties and margins of error, not with exaggerations, but unfortunately public awareness campaigns tend to be always like this.<br /><br />Full Disclosure: I do not have any interest on polluting industries, but just on preserving our Blue Planet for future generations and in keeping a skeptic and scientific attitude toward Global Warming. This review did not pretend to be a lecture on climate, nor I am an expert on climate, but with a basic knowledge of scientific principles, a little bit of understanding of physics, some basic familiarity with real simulation models, and enough curiosity and skepticism should be enough to help you reach your own conclusions. Hopefully, the tools are available to anyone in the world; you can just check the facts by yourself through the web and make up your own judgment. A good starting point for more details on the science behind Global Warming is a Wikipedia search for \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" and \\"State of Fear\\" (the controversial novel by Michael Crichton that Gore took the time to make some rebuttal in the companion book). Read the critics of both, and follow the links. Available also through the web, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 Report is a must if you are really serious about the subject of GW, read Chapter 8, that presents Climate Models and their evaluation. Check also the 2001 IPCC report, to see how the science and the consensus has changed over time. Also Michael Crichton's speeches \\"Environmentalism as Religion\\" and \\"The Case for Skepticism on Global Warming\\" are recommended (both transcriptions can be found at MC's web site). If you want to understand the basics of computer simulation, Wikipedia has a good summary. But be aware, when using computers models, if garbage goes in garbage comes out....<br /><br />PS: as suggested by a fellow Amazonian (see comments), The Future of Everything: The Science of Prediction (Apollo's Arrow in the Canadian version) by David Orrell is an objective critical analysis of climate modeling for future predictions, including also analysis of modeling in the fields of health and economics, and how they relate to climate prediction in the long-term. This book also presents a brief but very comprehensive summary of the philosophy and history of science, including meteorology and weather forcasting. If your are genuinely interested in the limitations of the science behind Global Warming, this book is a must-read. Also highly recommended is \\"Global Warming - Myth or Reality?: The Erring Ways of Climatology\\" by Marcel Leroux (too bad this is an expensive book!).

B000S0GYRU|4.0|The premise as most know a girl Suzy Banyon, an American ballet dancer arrives at a well known European dance academy run by mysterious teachers where nothing is as it seems.  As Suzy arrives at night in a horrible thunder and lightening storm a girl is leaving in a frenzy yelling a secret into the night, what follows is as Entertainment Weekly calls \\"the most vicious murder scene ever filmed\\".     Director Dario Argento \\"paints\\" an effective horror story, he puts relatable people in relatable situations so we can buy into his film.  Then very cleverly has dreamlike sets bursting with colors, we as viewers subconsciously know something isn't right and I believe this use of color subtly keeps us on edge.  Even the title of the film, What is Suspiria?  I googled it to find it is a film by Dario Argento, so even the title has us subconsciously unsure going in.  Although I could be wrong on that.  Then add an unrelenting, nerve wracking, and haunting score by Goblin (one of the most effective I've experienced).

B000OLGCHA|1.0|This was the worst Harry Potter CD ever.  John Williams really knows what he is doing.    The other cds at least played the music in the order of the events from the movie.  This one jumps all over the place.    The sound goes from so low you can't hear it so that you have to raise the volume to so loud that it hurts your ears.  Most of the time I feel like I'm listening to nothing.    For the next cd, they need to get John Williams back.  Even if the movies are darker, the music can still sound like HP music.  The theme song wasn't there at all.    Sorry I bought this CD
0778321606|5.0|I liked reading this book. The author must have talked to someone with cancer because many of the feelings that I had during the three years I battled cancer were the same as Lynda. It was predictable. You knew everyone would have a happy ending to their story, which is not a bad thing but not realistic.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Clint Eastwood's anti-war masterpiece belongs in the same company as \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" \\"Grand Illusion\\" and \\"Paths of Glory.\\" The veteran filmmaker endured the lackluster \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" in order to create this stark, intimate study of the Iwo Jima conflict from a Japanese perspective. Abetted by a revelatory cast and Tom Stern's brilliant cinematography, Eastwood's direction evokes a haunting power exceedingly rare in today's cinema. \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" transcends its genre as a truly unique and humanistic work.
B00005QDW5|4.0|For starters, this 2-disc greatest-hits compilation does justice by summarizing the best from Pink Floyd's long recording career.  However, the way the songs are listed could've been thought out more meticulously and arranged differently.  And there are a few songs that could've been omitted such as The Fletcher Memorial Home and When The Tigers Broke Free since these tunes focus more on Roger Waters's songwriting genius rather than the collaborative effort of the whole band.  These could've been replaced with fine tunes such as Welcome To The Machine and Have A Cigar.  Its a good thing they included the song Echoes, the namesake of this greatest-hits package, since that tune exemplifies the band at the peak of its creative ability.  All in all, not a really bad track list only it could've been better arranged and some songs could've been left out.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Look if you are going to see this for the first time, your in for a treat.  If your decideing between this and the other version of this,  This is the beter copy.  It may be a double dip, but the extras are well worth it.    Easily accessable for Scifi fans and non fans of the show.  Beter if your a fan of the show.  This is one of the best movies of 2005.  While in most places it tanked, in areas like where i live, the theaters sold out, and further had to be moved to a larger theater to accomidate the customers.    Argue if you want, But it's beter than the prequel star wars trillogy, and in this reviewers opinion beter than almost anyt other sci fi movie ever made.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Quite simply, this is the greatest band that has ever created music. The true shame is that there are only five of them and they only have time to create so many songs. Every great song ever written should have been given by this band to perform. Instead of having hacks like Rush perform \\"Tom Sawyer\\", you could have had a real drummer like Roger Taylor putting on a show. Instead of New Kids on the Block, or as I call them \\"Chunky ham in a can\\", performing Hanging tough, you could've had a real tough band like Duran squared performing the crizzap out of it. How has Duran Duran influenced a life as legendary as mine. Well, put down that can of almonds and I'll tell you.    Back in the mid 80s, I was crafting my image that I now have. The ladies were already watching with great interest the slightest move I would make. No one wore a swatch guard at my elementary school until I wore a swatch guard. No one wore a ten gallon hat and a child's evening fur until I did. Let's just say that I set trends. It was time for the sixth grade talent show and I decided to form a Duran Duran cover band called Mayor Foosball and the angry butt cloud. We became the biggest band on the scene before the talent show, but it was our presence that allowed the school to sell tickets to the talent show for $[...] each. We raised enough money to bulldoze our school and build a brand new one. Our version of \\"The Reflex\\" made six girls faint. Yup, such is my life. I just took average out to the backyard and buried it.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|I knew what I was getting into when I bought this CD...LOTS of anger girl stuff.  So it was no surprise when I opened it and played it for the first time.  The problem is that the music is SO raw that it wears on my nerves. The guitars rail on nearly every song, and the way her voice is mixed leaves me feeling like I need a Valium... And I LIKE harder rock tunes. I bought it because it was a Kelly Clarkson CD and I love her music.  Unfortunately, I don't love this collection.  I do however think that \\"Maybe\\" is a terrific tune...more like the Kelly I've come to admire over the years.  Perhaps her alliance with Reba McIntyre will produce some more listen-able tunes on her next album.
B000E41MS6|5.0|If you were into the old Doctor Who you'll love this one even better.  My teenage children were really into this, too.  This doctor has a quirkiness about him that keeps you watching.  It's a great collection.
B000002I6V|5.0|My husband LOVES this CD and wore grooves into it when it was an LP. I do too!  This was recorded when people actually wrote songs, not anger anthems, or rib jarring beat boxing tunes...each tune carries a timely message, well performed, and worth every penny.

The book is part of a series and it is of a society that acts quite differently than what we are used to. Pick it up and read it sometime.

0099422697|2.0|Roth writes well and the book keeps your interest throughout.  But I felt the ride wasn't worth it in the end.  His story of a man being undone emotionally by a younger woman certainly isn't the best novel on the topic.  Personally, I couldn't seem to build sufficient empathy for the main character.  Loved the short format though.
0151013047|5.0|On first glance, \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" by Mohsin Hamid appears to be about a brilliant young Pakistani national named Changez who finishes at the top of his class at Princeton and is hired by Underwood Samson, the most prestigious and world-famous corporate valuation firm based in New York City. We are encouraged by the title and the dark overtones of the dramatic monologue in which the book is narrated, to believe that somehow, by the end of the novel, Changez turns into a Muslim fundamentalist and implied terrorist.  Wow, now that is a theme that really hits a bull's-eye with the American psyche!<br /><br />Most Americans are sincerely confused by what is happening in the world today. We see rampant anti-Americanism, frightening Islamic terrorism, news of successful professionals being recruited into the ranks of the terrorists, and we can't imagine why. We hope to get inside the head of one of these characters and see the world from their point of view--perhaps finally understand what drives them to these drastic ends.<br /><br />The book delivers on these issues and much more--very clever indeed! The monologue is narrated with spare, well-crafted prose that is often old-fashioned--and disconcerting.  The archaic prose casts the story in a shroud of strangeness elevating the suspense and making the whole an unequivocal, unrelenting page-turner.<br /><br />There is a marvelous linguistic and thematic trick built into that word \\"fundamentalist\\" used in the title and the text of the book. In the entire novel, religion is never once mentioned. Fundamentalism, in the context of terrorism, always refers to religious fundamentalism. But this book is not about a budding Muslim fundamentalist. So what type of fundamentalist is this, and why is he reluctant?<br /><br />This is about a man fighting two inner battles: one moral and one political.  In the beginning of his skyrocketing American dream career, Changez is temporarily blinded to one of his most ingrained core moral values: compassion. He comes from a family and a culture where people, no matter how poor, routinely celebrate their greatest joys by giving generously to the poor. When Changez comes home to Pakistan for a brief visit with his family, his mother dances ecstatically twirling a 100-rupee note over her head. What a wonderful image! Now, ask yourself how we in the West celebrate our greatest achievements and joys, and let this, and the other similar nuggets of open, cross-cultural insights peppered throughout this work, ignite your thinking about contemporary world issues!<br /><br />In the beginning, Changez feels stirrings of compassion for the \\"soon-to-be-redundant workers\\" (p. 99) that will, no doubt, fall victim to his brilliantly accurate valuation analyses. Sensing this, Jim, Changez' corporate mentor at Underwood Samson, coaches him often to \\"focus on the fundamentals\\"--the bottom line, the numbers, don't let emotion or compassion get in the way. However, by the time the book draws to a close--when Changez is in Valparaiso, Chile helping valuate a troubled book publishing firm that spends too much of its assets publishing worthy academic, literary, and poetic books that eventually end up losing money for the firm--here Changez becomes the reluctant fundamentalist of the book's title. He can no longer focus only on the bottom line. He can no longer ignore the deep core of compassion that is his personal moral compass.<br /><br />So, does he also become a fundamentalist terrorist? The author leaves that up to you to decide. The ending is deftly and provokingly ambiguous. But no matter which ending you choose to imagine--and you will vacillate--the overall cross-cultural thematic points have already been made, and that is what is important and what endures long after you've finished the book.<br /><br />There is also the inner political battle that Changez undergoes during the course of the novel. He begins his job at Underwood Samson a few months before 9/11. How he reacts to that news, and how America changes in the wake of that news--both form crucial themes that resonate throughout. In many ways the book is about the dangers of not embracing change. The author and the main character find much fault with America's fundamental backwards-looking reaction after 9/11. Instead of trying to come to terms with how America must fundamentally change in the new post-9/11 world order, Changez sees Americans retreating back to an old-fashioned nostalgia for America, the righteous superpower, the imperialistic dominator of the globe. To Changez, America's self-righteous nostalgia is a terminal illness. To mirror this theme, there is lovely parallel story of Changez' love for the mentally fragile Erica. She fails precisely because she cannot free herself from her nostalgia for her dead former lover. She cannot move forward with her life, despite the fact that the reader can see very clearly that Changez and Erica have the makings of a truly enduring love.<br /><br />So if America is failing to change, and Erica fails to change, what happens to Changez? He changes (change-ez)! [Is this, too, along with the word \\"fundamentalist,\\" perhaps another linguistic thematic pun?] We the reader are left to figure out if the main character's change is for the better, or not. Thus the ambiguous ending leaves us wondering.<br /><br />This novel is so clever! It really makes you think. It entertains with suspense as well as giving you an achingly beautiful love story--and underlying all is much to be learned about the current state of the world.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly, as I also do one of the other top contenders for the 2007 Booker Prize, namely Ian McEwen's \\"[[ASIN:0385522401 On Chesil Beach]].\\" (I've also reviewed this book here on Amazon.) Personally, I hope Hamid's \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" will win. I believe it clearly deserves it.ca changes in the wake of that news--both form crucial themes that resonate throughout.

0440237688|5.0|Anyone who wouldn't give this book 5 stars, must have missed the point.  It's on my list of 10 all-time best books I've read.  I read the book 10 years ago & still think about the main characters.  This author is such a clever writer.  A real pleasure to read her books.  I've read them as an adult, even though they are written for teens.  Great book club discussion book!
0374105235|5.0|What an amazing story that at times was very difficult to read. Not due to the writing, but the content instead. Ishmael Beah takes the reader on his unspeakable journey as a child soldier in his wartorn country in Africa. It is truly amazing that he survived and was also able to write such a fascinating story about his life. My only wish was that the story took us on his trip all the way back to the United States instead of ending the way it did (no spoiler).    If you are looking for another powerful story of survival and perserverance in the face of adversity I recommend \\"The Time Keeper\\" by Kevin E Cropp. Although not nearly as horrific a tale, it is equally as rewarding.

B000QXDED6|5.0|I don't know what bored anyone who watched this because it was intense throughout.  (Granted I have a 60\\" hdtv with awesome surround sound).  I saw 5 seconds of the previews and shut my eyes and said, I'm getting it.  Two shipping days later it came, wife and kids were gone, so I went for it.    The whole movie was intense and epic in scope.  The visuals were incedible and the sound draws you into the movie in a big way.  If you're a person that loves those sword fighting movies like \\"Troy\\" or \\"Gladiator\\" then you'll love this movie.  It does have characters of fantasy in it and doesn't try to be a historical film, but I think it adds much to the movie and gives it a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" feel.      Any guy should enjoy this film immensely if they like action. I plan on watching this one again (very soon) which is something I rarely ever do with a movie.
B000002JPA|5.0|We'll, I have finally got around to this review.  I bought this album back in summer of '93 and it has been a companion to me for all these years.  Now, it is interesting after so many years to write a review and to read others reveiws of this album.  Before I spew my feelings publicly about I&W I thought I would take a moment to say how polarizing DT and this album has become.  For some such as myself it was groundbreaking and changed my whole musical sensibilities, for others it is ho hum, and yet some get angry that DT even carriers a prog label.  It would seem to me that a lot of people who give this album 1 or 2 stars unfairly try to fit this album into a specific prog genre.  For some it is too self indugent in technical ability and not enough like Genesis or ELP or any other 70's golden era prog superstars.  And then for some it is not metal enough and giving it a prog/metal label is insulting.  To me the fact that this album cannot be classified in any certain prog genre is what makes it so amazing and it should be taken at face value as just a great work of music.    Now, it is obvius that DT caught lighting in a bottle with this album against all odds in '93 when metal had been dead for well over a year but I believe that this was due to the revolutionary nature of the music.  It is hard, it is technical, it is melodic, it is full of fusion, it is atmospheric, it has the power ballad and it is what a lot of us music nerds needed in the era of dumbed down grunge.  Some criticize DT for their technical ability and in their current releases I can understand this argument more but on I&W their technical ability was used to compliment the overall song rather than the song being a slave to the technical showmanship and Portnoy and Petrucci are much more restrained and intelligent about their playing.  This was also a time when Kevin Moore put his fingerprint on DT's music both lyrically and emotionally.  Since Moore left after Awake DT has struggled to find thatsame level of song writing hitting it sporatically along the way.  On I&W it is there the whole way through and this is a great album for those who like their prog a bit heavier, technical, and a little more accessible than mainstay prog acts.    Overall, I think Awake is a slightly stronger release and A Change of Seasons is their prog masterpiece but I&W is what started it all and will remain legendary for it.

0060763892|5.0|James Rollins was born in Chicago, Illinois, is 1961. With his three brothers and three sisters, he was raised in the Midwest and rural Canada. He graduated with a doctorate in veterinary medicine from the University of Missouri and went on to establish his own veterinary practice in Sacramento, California. His sense of adventure often takes him either underground or underwater.    I  am a big fan of all the books by James Rollins and he has kept the standard very high. Some writer seem to have peaks and troughs, a couple of good books and then a mediocre one, but not Mr. Rollins. All of his books have been first rate.    I don't really want to get into the James Rollins versus Dan Brown thing. I am not ashamed to admit that I enjoy Dan Brown's books too. Although I do not think the Da Vinci Code was his best. Each author has his own merits and  nothing is gained by comparing the two of them.    This is another Sigma Force novel: Ancient ruins surrounded by almost impenetrable jungle, conceal a deadly secret. At the other side of the world, buried in a tomb in Venice lies a truth that could and will shatter the world. But nothing remains a secret for ever and it is up to Sigma Force to deal with anything that comes there way . . .    Whether it's jungle, underwater or high in the mountains of Tibet, James Rollins knows how to tell a cracking story in his own inimitable way.

B000OCY7JE|5.0|I'm being spoiled. First I see the beautiful, mature and delightful Mira Nair film \\"The Namesake\\" (in my top twenty with a bullet) - and now this peach! What's going on!!<br /><br />\\"After The Wedding\\" has a central performance from Mads Mikkelsen (the facially scared card-playing Le Chiffre in the superb \\"Casino Royale\\") that is both riveting and Oscar worthy. He's the kind of actor who can just stand there and whole worlds are expressed in his strangely compelling face - an instrument I'm sure the director knew would have us hooked right from the get go. When Mads smiles, you smile, when he hurts - you hurt. When he's on screen, he's riveting, like say Gary Oldman is. And I can imagine, many women wouldn't mind looking at him either - long after the two hours of this is up!<br /><br />This Danish made movie opens with Jakob (Mads Mikkelsen) in an Indian orphanage - where he is distributing food from a truck, giving lessons in English in a shed of a building and generally holding it all together. But as always - lack of funds threathen imminent closure and the destitute children will be evicted out onto the harsh streets. He gets a phonecall from Denmark from Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard playing a millionaire businessman) with an offer of untold millions that will keep his orphanage open and indeed even help others. He seems reluctant to go and get this gift horse, but he has to. Jakob promises the adoring children that he'll be back within a week and he won't let them down. But things change when he gets there.<br /><br />Attending the wedding of Anna (Jorgen's daughter), to his astonishment, Jakob recognises Jorgen's wife - and she him - there's been history. Without giving too much plot away - Jakob makes a staggering and life-changing discovery and also, slowly but surely, begins to understand Jorgen's interest in wanting him back in Denmark.<br /><br />This is about family, loved ones, the preciousness of our kids, betrayal, bad mistakes made in the past, another chance given to redeem them now - all  the best stuff - and although some of the performances are at times slightly 'over-the-top' - the movie has heart - and you root for these people all the way to the end.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly excellent - especially Mikkelson and Lassgard - who's rivalry and shared loves are beautifully and realistically handled. There were many scenes where tears willingly plopped out of my weary goggleboxes. And there's superb complimentary music too.<br /><br />I loved this film - I really did.

1582701709|3.0|First off, there are three versions of the Secret by Rhonda Byrne:        * the book, The Secret.      * the audiobook, The Secret.  This contains many different people's voices, presumably from the movie version.      * the movie, The Secret DVD!  Most of the reviews you've seen are about the movie.    I listened to the audiobook version.    I think how you are introduced to a book greatly influences how much you like it or at least how open you are to liking it.  I first heard about The Secret from a group of friends who watched the movie together and they couldn't say enough good about it.  I was supposed to beg, steal or borrow a copy to watch!  So I downloaded the audiobook version.  I enjoyed it but if I hadn't listened to The Attractor Factor first, I would have dismissed it all as hokey.  The Secret introduces the law of attraction with a lot of hype and very big promises.  They make it seem like it is possible to wish a bike or a winning lottery ticket into existence through sheer will power.  Now while I believe that remaining positive and open will mean that many more opportunities will be available to you than if you are always negative, I don't think you can wish tomorrow's winning lottery ticket into your hand.  So while the audiobook was uplifting and positive, it was a bit unrealistic.  So, I wonder, if I'd read this negative review first, or if I hadn't learned about the law of attraction from The Attractor Factor, I wonder if I would have liked The Secret at all?  Would the negative review have set me up to think negatively about it, would I have concentrated on the hokiness and would I be writing a really negative review now?  If so, it just goes to show you that thinking positive brings positive results (I enjoyed listening to the book) and thinking negative brings negative results (I might not have made it through the book!)  On the influencing positively side, The Secret made the top ten list at Amazon.com and The New York Times.  Does that make you want to read it now?
1582701709|1.0|On page 111 under Secret Summaries I found a very practical Secret, \\"Visualize checks in the mail\\". I thought I had better try this. It could get me out under from all that hard negativity, you know, don't spend too much and invest, or suffer the consequences. I applied the unfathomable power of my mind (the Secret is that I have got it too) with great intensity to create at least one unexpected check in the mail. But the result of my experiment, in the power of positive thinking, was negative. No check in the mail. I wonder if anyone else with a more powerful positive mind has done this experiment and generated a positive result? In my case I found that Quantum physics does not work on mailmen and  envelopes (those items are just too big I think).     Also this book does not have an index; that makes it difficult to research it to find out what I might have done wrong in my thought experiment. But I hate to end on such a negative note about a work that is all about being positive, so I will add that the cover is attractive, that is, it does attract the eye from a distance.
1401302378|4.0|The Long Tail is a must read for anyone wondering how the Internet works or how it's changing the world as we know it.  In the book, Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired Magazine, explains how one simple principle is behind so many of the social and economic changes we are seeing with the internet.  The Internet makes it possible for many people to produce and publish cheaply and for many other people to find those \\"amateur\\" works easily.  For example, until the Internet, the only music you had access to was the top 40 on the radio or maybe the top 500 albums at the music store and maybe a local band at the bar on weekends.  Now you have access to hundreds of thousands of songs written and produced by anybody and everybody in the world.  Not only that but they are easily searchable in many different ways.  So a you don't have to listen to just hits anymore and you don't have to be a world wide hit to be successful.  That's what is changing the world.  Niche markets are growing (around all of these non-hit works) and at the same time the way we share and find these niche products is becoming easier and easier - creating new communities online.    Chris Anderson explains it much better than me and I highly recommend the book if you've noticed that the Internet is changing the world and wondered why.
B000OONTFU|5.0|I'm not here to discuss the movies. By now, you've seen them, through the years of TV boardcasts, DVD, DVD re-releases and so on and so forth.    I'm here to focus on the amazing quality of these discs. The picture quality is unmatched, the sound quailty is breathtaking, and the extras are actually worth going through.     Video: 10/10    Unmatched. The only movies that come close are King Kong, Hot Fuzz, Superman Returns, Batman Begins and 300. These movies have obviously been remastered and preserved over the years, and it shows.    Sound: 10/10    Dolby TrueHD for all 3 movies. These discs will be among the first you'll pull out to show off the amazing sound quality and clarity that these films give. Especially the first one, which won an Oscar for sound design.    Extras: 10/10    35 hours of extras, 'nuff said.    This HD DVD is amoung the first you should buy and will probably be the first discs you use to show off to friends.
0393061310|4.0|If you like to ask \\"why\\" questions, this book is for you.  Jared Diamond answers why some societies succeeded and why some, like the Mayans or Aztecs, didn't.  I don't want to give away the book, but here are some examples that he uses:        * Agricultural societies could store food.  Storing food enabled them to have people who specialized in something besides food gathering, like writing or medicine or fighting.      * Storing food allowed them to conquer other societies because they could take their food along and so they didn't need to stop fighting to gather food.      * Keeping animals brought a lot of diseases.  The people that kept the animals eventually became immune to most of the diseases but they would bring those diseases (like smallpox) to other societies and it would wipe them out.     Jared Diamond also spends time explaining that he doesn't think industrialized societies are necessarily any better than hunter-gather societies - hunter-gatherers might have actually been healthier, taller, stronger - but he is just explaining why some succeed and others die out.    It's a very interesting book and worth reading if you like knowing why things happened the way they did.
075640407X|5.0|My husband and I picked up this novel because Amazon recommended it to fans of Jim Butcher. I had stopped reading fantasy novels for a few years because there was nothing that really interested me, but between Butcher and this new author, Patrick Rothfuss, I may have to look at the shelves again.     Rothfuss creates an incredibly complex main character, Kvothe, who we get to see both as the primary narrator as an adult, and throughout the retelling of his youth. The two periods of time are nicely woven together; usually extended flashbacks can make a story a lot harder to follow, but this time it's seamless. Or, rather, I should say it's realistic. The interruptions in the tales of the past are well-written--it's almost as if I was sitting in the inn listening to Kvothe tell his story, only to be shaken out of my reverie by a new arrival at the door.     In fact, Rothfuss is quite possibly one of the best narrative storytellers I've read in a long time. He has a wonderful way of weaving a story that captivates, and his dialogue is priceless--not corny, not ridiculous, but a mixture of soulfulness, humor and other deep emotional states that he hits right on. There's not a boring part in this story.    I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who liked Butcher's works and wants an author of similar caliber.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I have to say, I don't even know where to begin to write this review. By now, anyone who has been interested in this film knows the basic plot, so I'll spare you any details. All I have to say is this: if you are a Lynch fan, this is a must! It's one of the most rewarding mind trips that I've ever seen. There are some horrifying scenes here, but it's just like any other Lynch film - the scares presented here are more psychological than \\"jump\\" scares. Don't go into this expecting to jump out of your seat every minute. Most of it is a twisted mystery, sort of like \\"Mulholland Drive\\". There's lots of dialogue that is essential to the plot, so you have to PAY ATTENTION! No bathroom breaks! There is no intermission, and the DVD doesn't have chapter stops, so if you do have to piss, you best hit pause, because if you stop it, it'll start back right at the beginning. The two-disc DVD set is amazing. I need to watch it again. It blew my expectations away. I was expecting something completely different. RENT IT, BUY IT, just as long as you see it!    Highly, highly recommended!    ***I have a correction to make. The DVD does indeed contain chapter stops. I did not realize this until recently. David Lynch doesn't usually have chapter stops on his DVDs. He tends to believe films should be viewed in one sitting, but I guess he made an exception for this one.***
0060987464|5.0|this book is one of the best, most interesting books ive read in a while.  i may be biased because i have been listening to manson since i was in 3rd or 4th grade when PORTRAIT came out, but regardless, it is VERY well written, he is extremely smart which alot of people dont realize, and if you have a sense of humor like i do, you will find parts of this book to be absolutely hysterical (such as his first experience with certain drugs etc.) ...if you like manson or his music i HIGHLY suggest you read this book, if your anti-manson, or new to him, then you may not enjoy it as much, but it will definitely give you another perspective of his life other than how he portrays himself on stage... it seems we all have a little more in common with mr. manson than we may like to believe
B0000026VZ|5.0|Actually, I bought this album on CD to update my music collection from tape, so I was already familiar with the songs.  The CD arrived in a timely manner, and the sound quality of the songs is excellent.  As for the group, they had me with the famous \\"Pamela\\" video.  That song, and a lot of the others here, are great car sing-along songs for a variety of moods, including rock-out, bluesy, mellow, reflective and love-struck. I highly recommend this CD.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I think this is David Lynch's most visually interesting and beautiful film.  It wasn't really as strange or off the wall as I thought it would be after reading some of the reviews of it. It is gorgeous to look at and listen to and (at least for me) had a huge emotional impact.  I loved it.  Where do I think it fits in as far as overall excellence in terms of Lynch's feature films?  Better than ELEPHANT MAN, STRAIGHT STORY, MULHOLLAND DRVIE, and WILD AT HEART, but not so good as BLUE VELVET, ERASERHEAD, DUNE, FIRE WALK WITH ME or LOST HIGHWAY.  Just my opinion.  The DVD extras are awesome with excellent \\"stories\\" ala the stories on the ERASERHEAD and SHORT FILMS DVD's.  My favorite extra is a cooking demonstration from Lynch.  This is great stuff.
B00005JL3A|1.0|You watch an Ed Wood film, it's bad, but it's fun. It's fun because the director cared, and despite the fact that Ed Wood wasn't a good director, his personality and care is evident in his films.    Resident Evil is made by Paul Anderson, and he quite obviously doesn't care.    Forget what all of you are saying about 'It's another silly zombie movie' or 'It's from a game so I suppose it was always going to be bad'.    The reality is, the games are extremely well executed, as are George A Romero films (G.A.R being the original guy who was to direct this.)    A great story is in the telling, this story was not told well. It could not have been told worse. This guy, quite obviously, has no idea of how to tell a story or direct a film. I trusted him due to Mortal Kombat and Event Horizon, but after Resident Evil and the appauling AVP, it would appear that those first two films are only as good as they are due to good producers and scripts.    Stay away, stay well away.     An absolute travesty in every sense. To think of the millions of lives you could save with the money that was wasted on this garbage.

B000001DQI|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Released after Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player, it determines a strong change in Elton's music, a much personal and conceptual side of his music, but since this went on Elton's career though time, I certainly like with devotion this truly wonderful, delicate, masterpiece hit album. Did I mentioned that it has sold more than 20 million copies?<br /><br />A wonderful album, I enjoyed ALMOST every song in it and I also appreciate the way this album contains every beautiful sound, turns and twists through different styles and combinations. Its a very mellodic album, containing some extravagant, touchy novelties but mainly a consistent popcraft, and being enjoyably peculiar, so it will keep you entretained even though its very long, his longest work, but his most endurable. I'm sure listeners will be amazed, or at least curious, with all the varieties in the sounds and genres; ballads? it got them; rock and roll? it got it; reggae? YES, it got it.<br /><br />The amazing combination of genres, keeping catchy and fresh styles, its a strong highlight in each track, each of them so original, so here goes my personal brief opinions of each one of them: Funeral For A Friend (Love Lies Bleeding), for example its a 11 minute song mainly regarded as progressive rock, and its one of the greatest songs in the album, even my mom insists that I put this song in his funeral, containing a fantastic synthesizer introduction, later going through a dramatic piano prelude and focusing on rock and roll in the chorus, a really beautiful composition; not a prog fan?, well later goes Candle In The Wind original version, a balladry song about Marilyn Monroe, very enjoyable, a little bit overplayed but excellent; Bennie And The Jets its an R&B hit, a long time favorite, played with that magic in Elton's composition, and also containing some crowd sound arrengements so don't get confused; here comes a classic ballad, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, one of the first songs I ever heard from Elton John, and I still enjoy it a lot and play it regularly, being a melancholic ballad about missing home, a recognizable theme isn't it?; all I'm saying about This Song Has No Title is that its only worth if you read the lyrics without the music, a true, heartful poem shall I say; Grey Seal is very mellodic and memorable, it should've been a recognizable song; Jamaica Jerk-Off is a reggae song very experimental, personally I didn't like it, even when I come from a country where music is alike with this song, but it's a huge original song; I've Seen That Movie Too is one of those mellancholic ballads pretty good but it definitively goes out of tune with the orchestral arrengement and its made too long; Sweet Painted Lady is very much alike with the previous track only that I like it more, mainly because is shorter and more thematic; The Ballad Of Danny Bailey (1909-34) is one of those suburban balladry song wich keeps a great juvenile style and that young flavour that hadn't gone from Elton; Dirty Little Girl is the first true rock and roll song of the album, I personally didn't like it, but draw your conclussions then; All The Girls love Alice is another R&B song that is only saved by the marvelous instrumentation, it has its moments but this is an implicit adult theme expressed in the song, or at least thats what I supposed; Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock And Roll) is a fast paced rock and roll song which its VERY enjoyable when you're in a dancing mood but not for a quiet, ipod listening; the famous Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting is regarded as one of the greatest and hardest rock songs among Elton John's works, its an excellent track and also keeps a great fame, I also recommend to hear the The Who cover of this song; Roy Rogers is one of my favorite Elton's ballads, apart from having a tactful instrumentation it also has a very enjoyable theme about old comic heroes, like Roy Rogers which is regarded in the lyrics as a comicbook cowboy; Social Disease is a folkish, country like song, very rythmical although I insist it would have fit perfectly in Honky Chateau; well, everything comes to an end, and this masterpiece ends with the heartful Harmony, an inspiring balladry which keeps his slight fame but its a perfect song to listen after, for example, Roy Rogers.<br /><br />The album's composition is certainly a thoughtful and imaginative one, Taupin puts a flaming, thematic concentration in each of the songs' lyrics. Elton John's piano performance strikes back in this album, even better than a lot of his past works. Davey Johnstone applyies a dextrous guitar in almost every song, and his eventual acustic guitars add a marvelous sound. Dvid Hentschel A.R.P. synthesizer is the best feature in the album. Even though everything went almost perfect I got a slight problem with Del Newman orchestral arrengements, it made most of the tracks with this arrengement sound out of tune and unnecessarily arrenged.<br /><br />Well, in conclussion this is a lifetime, memorable album that will surely stay in my mind for a long time, I recommend to hear to it twice for better comprehension, because this set of heavy turns and twists through rythms and genres and sounds is a lot to take, anyway my strong recomendations and best wishes in your experience listening to this album.ial Disease is a folkish, country like song, very rythmical although I insist it would have fit perfectly in Honky Chateau; well, everything comes to an end, and this masterpiece ends with the heartful Harmony, an inspiring balladry which keeps his slight fame but its a perfect song to listen after, for example, Roy Rogers.

B00001OH7O|5.0|When I first heard that line, I had no idea what Bowie was talking about and because of that, it immediately sparked my curiosity.  I tell people that there is a limit to what can be reasonably deduced from a collection of words even though we all may interpret a song's lyrics somewhat differently, but I'm not sure if that rule applies in Bowie's case.  He often leaves a lot of room for latitude.  Bowie uses a sort of \\"cut-up\\", collage style of writing.  He's quoted as saying, \\"all I do is assemble points that interest me and puzzle through it.  That becomes a song, and people who listen to that song must take what they can from it\\".  I would describe much of Bowie's writing as a sort of quirky and sophisticated stream-of-consciousness. It's filled with his unique sense of wit and he makes brilliant use of symbolism to make poignant points while remaining ambiguous enough to allow the listener to interpret his songs however they need to.  That quote that I started off with is from \\"Quicksand\\" which is one of my favorite songs on this album.  \\"Quicksand\\" slowly builds anticipation through a masterful grasp of loud/soft sound dynamics and ends with one of the most beautiful and moving melodies that I've ever heard.  \\"Quicksand\\" basically seems to be about struggling with self-identity (and oh yeah, the Golden Dawn was a secret society of people who practiced a unique style of Kabbalan mysticism, and Aleister Crowley was an instrumental, and apparently highly controversial figure who later became a part of it).  The songs on the first half of the album are mostly spare with just piano, strings and light percussion, and a truly masterful sense of melody is displayed consistently (except for perhaps on the plaintive \\"Eight Line Poem\\", the melody on that song is scant at best, but it still manages to be a great song).  The music on the first half especially, has the feel of a conventional singer/songwriter album, but Bowie's wit, camp, quirkiness and sophistication make the material anything but conventional.  I find the intentional camp of both \\"Kooks\\" and \\"Fill Your Heart\\" to be absolutely hilarious.  The lyrics throughout are pretty quirky.  I particularly love the romanticized references to superior, more enlightened beings from outer space (this album is littered with such references: \\"all the strangers came today, and it looks as though they're here to stay...let me make it plain, got to make way for the homosuperior!\\" from \\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" for example).  At first I was put off by what I saw as the blatently pandering references to hipster icons during the second half of the album--\\"Andy Warhol\\", \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\" and Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground on \\"Queen B*tch\\"--because at first, I thought that they were just cheap and completely obvious attempts at \\"hipster cred\\" so to speak.  But, it's been said that Bowie was a chameleon of sorts who created characters and often took on the identity of those around him, and I think those songs were just his way of adeptly paying homage to artists that he really admired and respected.  \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\" in particular is a really clever and spot on imitation.  This is an album that I had to listen to closely in order to appreciate.  Most of the songs build slowly with spare instrumentation so they absolutely demand close attention.  But, this is one masterful piece of work that is well-worth it.
1416523359|1.0|This book is too slow and too boring. Unless you are totally bored and have nothing else to do, do not spend your precious time on these 600+ pages of boredom.
0061150142|1.0|I am so disappointed after finishing this book.  None of my questions were answered and not in the good way where it's left to your imagination. The characters are superficial. We never get beneath the surface with any of them and least of all Emily. I feel I knew Emily the least and that is the character I really wanted, and felt I should, know deep down. So many aspects are hard to believe. I really wanted to like this book and thought I did while I was reading it but for it to be so heart wrenching and then come out with nothing is really frustrating!
B000BT97AO|3.0|I had actually owned this movie for awhile, but had not gotten around to watching it until we went to see STARDUST...based on another Neil Gaiman story.  We enjoyed that very much, so I dug out the DVD and my wife and 14 year old daughter and I plunked down for an enjoyable evening.<br /><br />104 minutes later, my wife was asleep and my daughter barely awake.  I was still watching, but felt guilty for having wasted so much time.<br /><br />The movie is STUNNING to look at...no question about that.  It basically captures a feeling of a dream better than almost any movie in recent memory.  A young teenage girl, feeling worried and guilty about her mother's serious illness, falls into a dream inspired by her owned crazy drawings and driven by a growing need to rescue a \\"white\\" queen and vanquish (sorta) a \\"dark\\" queen.  Both queens are played by the actress who plays the mother, so we immediately assume that story is how the girl will work out the conflict between herself, her mother and even her mother's illness.<br /><br />The movie is fantastic to look at.  It is highly creepy, and made us all question the PG rating...we thought PG-13 would have been more appropriate.  The dreamland is populated by an assortment of disturbing creatures.  Each new scene brought a new visual splendor.  The film does not lack imagination.  It's like watching visual art come to life.  For awhile, we were enthralled.<br /><br />But then it become quite obvious that the film had nothing of real interest to tell us through these visuals.  The idea of a young girl working out serious problems in her life through dreams or dream-like incidents was just played out a  million times better in PAN'S LABRYNTH (although, to be fair, MIRRORMASK is even more visually creative).  The plot was quite skimpy and the journey of the young lady became repetitive and more and more uninvolving.  It was simply hard to want to watch through to the end.  I glanced at my watch every two or three minutes...thinking surely 15 minutes have gone by.<br /><br />Over the history of filmmaking, many visually stunning films have been made that stretched the boundaries of technical and visual possibilities.  2001: A SPACE ODDESSEY.  NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  And like those films, MIRROR MASK failed to enchant on a basic story-telling basis.<br /><br />Before I forget, let me first praise Stephanie Leonidas, who plays the teenage hero of the film.  She is terrific and I would have liked to see more of her performance and perhaps less upstaging by the visuals.<br /><br />The movie is an interesting failure.  In most cases, a film that bored me so thoroughly would get no more than 2 stars, possibly just 1...but MIRROR MASK has too much creativity to simply get slapped down.

0345494997|5.0|What a great read!  This was one of those stories that you just hated to put down and when you weren't reading you were thinking about it.  Nancy Horan has done an exceptional job of recreating the Love Story between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mammah Bothwick Cheney.  The story also provides great insight on how different life was for women in the early 1900's, and how little tolerance Society had for divorce.  My heart went out to Mammah as she struggled with her love for Frank and her responsiblities as a wife and Mother.  She was a brilliantly intelligent women, unfortunately living in the wrong era.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good love story.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|This was a fascinating movie and a bold trick to pull off! Originally a Steven Millhasuer short story, it would have been so easy for this movie to have failed, but the talented cast and crew actually produced a film worthy of Millhauser's rich story-telling. Edward Norton is a dream, a very lovely dream. How could any woman not be thoroughly in love with the Eisenheim character after seeing his performance? Jessica Biel as Sophie is surprisingly good - she really displays a great deal of maturity in this role and at the young age of 24; I predict she's got a bright future ahead of her as an actress. Giamatti was perfect - his performance was as strong as Norton's - his character a fascinating blend of contradiction and consistancy at the same time. Beautiful cinemotography, costumes, lighting, music. The orange tree scene is one of the most exquisite scenes I have ever watched. Didn't think it was possible to do Millhauser justice on screen, but this movie proves that it is.
B0000AUHPG|3.0|What does a film need to get rave reviews here on Amazon?  Simple.  Great visuals and cinematics.  That's why I only search for 3 star reviews.  Typically they're more balanced.      Without a doubt this movie has the best cinematics of any western to date.  I was completely drawn in by the visuals.  Normally, I don't get 'all excited' about cinematics but this was something else.  Especially considering it's age (1968).  One of Leone's trademarks I guess.    What I gather is that Lenone's talent was not just in his unique style of directing but also his inability or unwillingness to submit to 'isms' in his film making.  His westerns are what they are.  Miserable, hot, dry, and brutal.  Genuine portrayals of what the 'wild west' probably was.  I respect that.    Although the film isn't over the edge brutal or sexist, it's not women friendly and it's not a feel good movie of any kind.  There are a few descent fellows in it but there are no real heroes.  Everyone is a sinner.   Hustlin' no good sons of [...] trying to make a fortune.  Charles Bronson plays the role of 'the avenger' type but still not a real stand-up guy.  Claudia Cardinale - as incredibly beautiful as she was - plays a widowed whore and the only female (I think) in the movie.  The rest of the male characters aren't really any better in their moral makeup.      You can read into it, and I'm sure you'll find many parallels and portraying elements but mostly it's only what YOU make of it.  That's typically what people do with these types of films.  While I respect that it doesn't make it a great film in my eyes.  Important yes, but not great.  His earlier films starring Clint Eastwood, although not quite as brilliant ambiently, were in my eyes the best overall because they had a stronger direction and more defined characters that were in no way trite.  They remain some of my favorite movies of all time.
0345357116|5.0|...because breathtaking is the one word I would use to describe this work. People who have already read the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings and most especially the Silmarillion will have great appreciation for the further insight and mythology offered in the Unfinished Tales.     My favourite part has to be the story of Numenor; this is also the only collection of stories that contains a map of Numenor. It's my favourite because it ties in very nicely with the ending of the main section in the Silmarillion. I get the impression that Tolkien was figuratively \\"singing\\" of this fabulous and blessed kingdom of men which is referenced very often in the Lord of the Rings. So from the backward-looking perspective, it is very interesting as it gives the reader a much deeper, complex understanding of Aragorn, Elrond and the kindgom of Gondor in the Lord of the Rings. From the forward-looking perspective, however, it tells the story of a middle earth that has only just recovered from the ravages of the first age and the great wars therein.     Like other reviewers have mentioned, the other stories also serve to augment a Tolkien reader's existing knowledge of middle earth and the forces which have played a part in its history. While a very good (albeit complex) book on its own, it transforms into a consummate masterpiece when read with Tolkien's other stories.

It appears that the book is all about the mission when in fact half of it is about Navy Seal training, BUDs, Hell Week etc. Most wont find this a problem (as this is also interesting stuff) but Ive already read books on Seal training so I was a little annoyed by this surprise. Just know that youll be reading about Seal training until page 189. Dont worry though and dont be deterred because what follows is an amazing, riveting, edge of your seat story unlike any other. The sleep I was supposed to be getting had to take a back seat to the last 200 pages of this page turner. Once the story got going I knew I was in it until the end. WOW!!! Do not miss this one!!

B000000OUJ|5.0|Continuing the Wu-Tang Clan's saga of sword swinging chambers strikes member Genius or GZA's Liquid Swords.  Wu-Tang's sound provider RZA produced all with the exception of one with the Clan's signature style and sound to fit GZA's lyrical assault.  The album begins with the title track filled with looping keys and simplity, but animated by GZA's delivery such as \\"...lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers...\\"  Keeping the formula of success and sword swinging \\"Duel Of The Iron Mic\\" featuring Ol' Dirty [...], Dreddy Kruger, Inspektah Deck & Masta Killa blended the streets with the orient tales.  Genius shows his versitility on \\"Living In The World Today\\" by combining harsh street with sharp punchlines and wizardry.  \\"Gold\\" is a hustler's tale with aspirations of having more than what is given to him.  Reality of casualties from gun play and nonchalantness on \\"Cold World\\" featuring Inspektah Deck & Life is quite vivid.  From Wu's debut album Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) a hint is found on this album on \\"4th Chamber\\" featuring Ghostface Killer, RZA & Killah Priest is a gem.  \\"Shadowboxin'\\" featuring Method Man is one of the highlights of Liquid Swords to every degree.  \\"Hell's Wind Staff/Killah Hills 10304\\" this one verse no hook life of a narcotics dealer over a high pitched, yet well orchastrated organ/keys.  \\"...calling all cars, calling all cars...\\" for the well knit lyrical content for \\"Investigative Reports\\" featuring Raekwon, Ghostface Killer & U-God adds support for this LP.

0962477060|5.0|I originally wrote this review for Volume I, but it applies here too.<br /><br />The reviews below all sound wonderful, even the ones that weren't five stars. Too good to be true I thought, so I only bought Volume I, rather than the box set. After a week of study, and occasionly rereading the same paragraph over and over until I got it, I too will say that this book did more for me in a week than all the decades of playing guitar and buying countless other books.<br /><br />Still I was skeptical about the other volumes, so I decided that rather than buy the box set with the DVD I'd just buy the combination of Volumes I and II, and give Volume I to a friend. After spending some time with Volume II, I realized I needed the DVD. Amazon just emailed today saying the box set of three volumes plus the DVD has just shipped.<br /><br />Let me save you some time and money - buy the box set with the DVD. I say that without having seen the DVD, but from what I see with Volumes I and II, I think you're going to want to do that. Like everyone else, I only wish that I had discovered this book when I was a kid.
B000NA28IE|2.0|I understand that there is no such thing as a perfect book-to-silver-screen adaptation, but the director and screenwriters could have at least let the plot be the plot.  The Potter films have been incredibly successful at leaving out certain elements while keeping the basic story the same.  The filmmakers in the case of Eragon simply decided to write their own story and use the character names from the book.  Further, they wrote a bad story with a bad script and bad actors, with the exception of Jeremy Irons.  Irons is certainly in his element as the grizzled, creepy, old war hero and is the only redeeming quality to the movie.  It is a shame because the book had so much big screen potential.  I almost wish the production company would scrap any plans for a sequel, wait several years, and then restart with better personnel.  However, they might have to put Jeremy Irons in cryogenic storage so that he can reprise his role
0156027321|1.0|I read this book based on reviews and word of mouth. Never was there a book more overhyped! A nice story I suppose..but incredibly long and boring. Not worth the hype.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|I happen to be a huge KISS fan and I actually like the music more than the merchandise Gene likes to shove down our throats.   With that in mind, I thought this was going to be another collection of the same ol' stuff that was put out to make up for the dismal Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons solo albums over the last few years.  I went ahead and got it anyway and I was so surprised when I saw the rawness that made KISS the biggest selling act in the 70s.  The sound the band has in those early concerts is powerful and I hope it's unadulterated (unlike the Alive albums which were touched up in the studio).    The San Francisco concert shows for me one of Peter's best performances and an the Ace Frehley that inspired sooo many young kids to pick up a guitar.  I absolutely love this DVD and I can't wait for Volume 2 to come out.
B000RIWAVW|1.0|This is the EXACT SAME DISC that was released in 1998! If you own that then you already have this disc! Do not be fooled by a fancy new slipcover! Anchor Bay is notorious for selling us all the exact same discs over and over with different covers, don't fall for it this time!
0061124265|5.0|I loved this book because it gives valuable lessons for life and makes living more interesting. Mr Coelho is a talented writer unlike other writers he makes you feel like you are with them in the scene. What attracted my attention the most was how realistic this book was and how it could change many people's opinion on life and it could even change the way they live. If there was a rating of 6 stars I would've chosen it.   If you haven't read it then you're missing alot on life!
B000QUCNP4|3.0|The problem with a true story is you know how it ends if you're familiar with the issue. Zodiac was San Francisco's notorious, infamous late 1960s serial killer...that was never caught. So my expectations were set for one of those unsatisfying movies that end without closure, and my expectations were met.<br /><br />Zodiac is not about the Zodiac killer as much as it is about the people involved in the pursuit of the Zodiac, and how those peoples' lives were effected/changed/...even ruined as a result of the failed hunt for the killer.<br /><br />Zodiac is chock-full of excellent actors that give you A-list performances. But in its 2 1/2+ hour run time, the action and suspense for my short attention span were much too far and few between.<br /><br />David Fincher directs Zodiac, and his resume is full of \\"good\\" movies. [[ASIN:B00011CZRE Se7en]] is Fincher's 1995, 5-star story of a fictional serial killer that was much more entertaining than Zodiac. If you're looking for a police story, you'll enjoy Zodiac. If you want a thrilling movie about a serial killer, Se7en is your lucky number.<br /><br />Case closed.

B00006AG5N|5.0|This cd is one of the best I have heard in a long time! All of Elvis's biggest hits in one dynamite package!! I would recommend,however,that you purchase Second to None along with it and you will have all the essential Elvis recordings to listen to whenever you want!
B000O75F7C|5.0|FOABP is without a doubt one of the most significant albums to emerge from 2007.  Thematically this album centers on the fear that today's youth are becoming out of touch, imbibing on an excess of tv, computers, prescription drugs, and instant gratification, opting to live a life of self centered ease instead of a life full of achievement and challenge.  The music is brilliant and the lyrics haunting.  My two favorites off this album are \\"Ashes\\", which I think is an amazing piece of work, and \\"Anesthetize\\", a 17+ minute opus featuring Alex Lifeson of Rush on lead guitar.  Robert Fripp makes an appearance on \\"Way Out of Here\\", providing some very King Crimsonesque 'soundscapes'.    I will admit that it took several times listening through this album to begin to understand and appreciate it, but that time has been rewarded.  Porcupine Tree's music is deep, sometimes spacey, but relevant and interesting.  Any prog rock fan needs to give this album a listen.  Highly recommended.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What can I say?  Cancelled TV shows aren't supposed to become major motion pictures.  But this one did, and it's fantastic.    You don't have to have seen [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] to appreciate this movie, but if you like Serenity (and you will) you'll want to see Firefly, and then you'll have seen it all out of order, so just go ahead and see Firefly first.    That being said, the movie is fantastic.  Aside from a couple of plot points that I could have done without (*ahem*) it's masterful.  It's wonderful storytelling about captivating characters on a marvelous adventure.  What else is there to ask for?
1594489505|5.0|After reading \\"The Kite Runner\\", I ordered this book.  What a great book!  I loved them both and they are both very well written and poignant stories of courageous people.  I would highly recommend either of Mr. Housseini's books.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm sure these comments are repeated again and again throughout the reviews, but I'll add mine to the pile.  Firefly is absolutely, 100%, my favorite TV show of all time.  The writing, the characters, the acting, the action are all above my expectations for television (which sadly, may be why it was cancelled so early in it's run.  Having the DVDs to watch whenever I like (which is often -- I've seen the entire series 8 times, and I'm on my 9th time through -- how many shows can you say that about?) is wonderful.  In fact, I own a second copy, just to loan out to people so I don't have to be without my own copy.  My sister (16) and my brother (28) just recently got both Firefly, and the movie based on it [[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]] for their birthdays.    I recommend Firefly without reservation.  I am not now, nor have I ever been, a science fiction fan.  This is different.  Trust me.  Watch it.  You won't be disappointed.
1423328442|5.0|Easily as good as his previous novels, Jonathan Tropper is a wonderful writer and the only bad thing I can say is that he takes too long to write his books!  He has a an eye for a detail and a way with words and it's a magical combo for those of us who love writers who can get inside our head! Thanks Jonathan for another great read. Write, write, write.
B000RJO58M|5.0|Hot Fuzz is a fantastic parody of the Hollywood buddy-cop movie ([[ASIN:B00004STUL Bad Boys (Special Edition)]] etc.). In a similar fashion to [[ASIN:B000R8YC3G Shaun of the Dead [HD DVD]]], the movie's attraction comes from the tongue-in-cheek nature of the humor. There's no laughter track just great scenes that are funny by their absurdity. For example, imagine watching a Robert Rodriguez gun battle([[ASIN:B000ASDFI6 Robert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico)]]) set in a small English country village.    On the HD front, the video presentation is five star with great colors, sharp definition and no encoder issues. The audio is also top quality with a great mix which really comes to the fore in the more explosive parts of the movie. This disc also has the most number of extras that I've seen yet on a single disc HD release, including one of the more interesting ones that I have seen which follows the movie from its original conception through to the final form.

0743289684|5.0|The face of reason confronts Dark Age primitiveness. That summarizes Infidel, the autobiography of Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The face of reason is hers, the beautiful, intransigent face that appears on the cover of her book.    Ms. Ali was born in Somalia. She grew up in that country, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya. Her father fought for a better government in Somalia but he, along with all of the people close to her, were Muslims. Primitivism meant female genital circumcision, which she endured without anesthesia at age 6. Primitivism meant Muslim Brotherhood imams preaching fundamentalism. Primitivism meant women wearing restrictive hidjabs. Primitivism meant having to endure forced marriages and beatings from your husband, if he so chose. Primitivism meant an oppressive clan network that reached all the way into European countries.    Rejecting the primitiveness of her background, Infidel is the story of Ms. Ali's personal unfolding, and her discovery of the Western values of free speech, the right to one's own life, and religious freedom. By the end of the book, Ms. Ali declares herself an infidel, since she rejects the Islamic faith that she grew up with. She rejects all religious faith. Step by step over the course of her life, Infidel shows her make the conclusions that brought reason into her life.    For that, for the ideas she publicly stated as a member of Parliament in Holland, for a movie she made, and ultimately for this book, Ayaan Hirsi Ali has had a death sentence placed on her. Like Salman Rushdie, a fatwa is on her life. The director of her movie, Theo Van Gogh, was already murdered in cold blood on the streets of Amsterdam.    Today, Ms. Ali lives in the freest country on earth, the United States. Her book is a warning to us of the nature of the Muslim enemy we fight. Islam is not a religion of peace; it is a religion of unspeakable evil.
B00005JPQL|5.0|My wife and I saw Stardust after reading a review; otherwise we would not have paid any attention to this delightful film. Stardust has been described as an adult version of Shrek but the comparison does not do this film justice.  The story of the film has been told by other reviewers but, in short (and not to give away too much): the story is about a village named Wall that abuts on a magical kingdom called Stormhold.  The two places are separatred by an actual wall but a portion of the wall has crumbled and is guarded day and night to be sure the two worlds do not mix. But, of course, a young man from Wall is bold enough to make it past the guard and have a tryst in Stormhold which results in his being presented with a baby boy nine months later.  That baby, named Tristan, eventually follows in his father's footsteps going through the wall to find a fallen star (named Yvaine, who is played by Clair Danes) to give to his love interest, and so his adventures begin.  The star is sought after by others including a witch (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) who needs the heart of the star because it given eternal life (for as long as it lasts anyway) and Septimus (played by Mark Strong) who needs the jewel the star possesses in order to become king.      The film has a number of cameo appearances: Peter O'Toole plays the dying king of Stormhold, Robert DeNiro plays a soft-hearted pirate who captures lightening bolts as his booty, Rupert Everett as Secundus and Ian McKellen provides the narration.  Charlie Cox is very good as Tristan, portraying him as a love-struck boy wanting to win the hand of Victoria (Sienna Miller) who is more impressed by what Tristan can buy her to prove his love.  Tristan grows up during the film and Mr. Cox does the transition in character nicely.  Michelle Pfeiffer, however, steals the movie as the witch Lamia who is desperate to capture the star and is continually barely thwarted by Tristan.      After so many rough-and-tumble action pictures during the summer is was a treat to see a fantasy like Stardust.  The production is excellent - the village of Wall has the look and feel of a 19th century English village - and the film is well-paced and has a nice sense of humor, particularly from Septimus' ghostly murdered brothers who pass comment on the action.  In short, a film that is highly entertaining and fun to watch. I will be looking for Stardust when it appears on DVD.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|...because Afterglow was my very first exposure to Sarah Mclachlan.     There is something in this voice, in the lyrics, in the music, an authenticity, a sincerity, that flexes underneath these very simple songs, you never quite see it coming, it's a kind of emotional sucker-punch. I don't often cry, but oh my god, Sarah Mclachlan, Afterglow rung me out as silly as a submarine with screen doors.    The girl can sing. But Pierre Marchand deserves much praise for the foxlike subtlety of these arrangments and the ethereal flow from song to song. I was not surprised to learn that he has been an integral part of the Mclachlan magic for a long time. Kudos to Pierre, and to Sarah for choosing him.    Initially, Fallen and Stupid were the most important tracks to me, but eventually Push, Time, and Drifting, all worked their way into my heart as well. There are no weak tracks, non that I skip over.     I let Afterglow play continuously and exclusively for two weeks in my Nissan Pathfinder. I ran all kinds of silly errands, took the longest possible route, for any excuse at all, just be left alone with this incredible songwriter in my car.    After five days, I had to have it all, so I ordered her entire catalog, and yeah, okay I agree that Fumbling is amazing, and indeed, I'm not surprised that Surfacing sold 11 million units, but Afterglow is not dimished in the presence of these obvious masterworks.     5 Stars for Afterglow, and boogie on Sarah Mclachlan!
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Absolutely THE finest television series that has EVER been produced in the entire history of television!  The man was an absolute genius.  And furthermore, he had GUTS enough to insist that it NOT be a committee project.  It's HIS work of genius and his alone.  The product speaks for itself.  NOTHING has ever even come close to equaling it.  If you're interested in LEARNING something, THIS is the program.  What more could I say, except that I have FIVE copies of this same series that I taped off the air when PBS had intelligence enough to broadcast it twenty years ago, and I bought this DVD copy of the series simply because the video quality is a little better than the over the air broadcasts were back then.

In the end, the joke was on me.   Waste of money. Someone pass the soap plz...    In case you're wondering, the title of this review references the rather   insulting example of how to 'accentuate the positive'.  That was really  the best example this creative gOD could come up with?  Wow!
B000I0RR7Q|5.0|I can't imagine Casablanca ever looked this good.  The HD version -- especially  when shown on a big screen with a projector -- looks stunning.  The movie, of course is as good as ever -- amazing forshadowing into the future of the war.  But the picture and sound of the HD disc make it worth every penny.  I had not seen the movie in well over a decade, and the story seemed fresh and new to me as well.  If it's been a while since you've watched it, this is the way to treat yourself.
B000FA57RG|5.0|This is a behind-the-scenes look at Madonna and her dance troupe during her Re-Invention World Tour. It was just under two hours but it went by quickly. Madonna has matured a lot since Truth or Dare. She comes across as caring and fun to be with.<br /><br />This documentary has many relevant messages like being responsible for your actions and your words as well as achieving more by learning more. She talks about religion, politics, relationships (romantic love versus true love) and family. There are particularly poignant moments when she talks intimately with the person behind the camera about her past and how much she's grown since then.<br /><br />Madonna looks great during the whole film which alternates between black and white and color performances. The viewer gets to see footage from auditions, rehearsals, tapings, shows and some interactions with Guy Ritchie and their children. There are a few celebrity cameos by Micheal Moore, Gwyneth Paltrow and Iggy pop.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching this video and felt inspired throughout it. It you're a fan of Madonna or are just a bit curious I think you'll enjoy this documentary. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|What I'm going to write will be minimal compared to many of the reviews here.  All I can say that here's one movie that actually lived up to its potential.  It's engrossing & more than holds your interest for the entire film.  You people on here whining about how long it is:  for crying out loud, if it's interesting, it doesn't matter about the length.  I've seen it three times now & it's still fascinating.  For the most part, it's very true to the books it's based on & the performances are great.  David Fincher did a brilliant job capturing the atmosphere of '69 & the overall creepiness factor is through the roof.  I never realized how eerie \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" really is.  I loved it!
0807014265|4.0|Very interesting book for anyone who suffers and cannot find any meaning from it.  Victor Frankel survived the concentration camps of the Holocaust during World War II.  If anybody knows about suffering it would be Frankel.  This is an about Christianity or Judaism... it's about believing that there is value in suffering and that nobody can take away your ability to decide how you will think about things in your life.  Only you control your own thoughts.  This is of course not for children.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|Director David Fincher fuses his signature gloom with docudrama in \\"Zodiac\\", which follows the interminable case of the Zodiac killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in 1969 and taunted police by reporting his own crimes and insisting that his messages be published in newspapers. The film is based on the books \\"Zodiac\\" and \\"Zodiac Unmasked\\" by Robert Graysmith, who was an editorial cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle when it was the Zodiac killer's favorite publicity generator and who went on to investigate the case himself, tracking down more evidence years after the case had been abandoned by police. The filmmakers did some investigating themselves, and audiences will wonder why some leads were not pursued -which only heighten the mystery and augment the notoriety of the Zodiac case.<br /><br />On July, 4 1969, a Vallejo, California couple are shot in their parked car. Four weeks later, someone calling himself \\"The Zodiac\\" takes credit for the murder and insists that the San Francisco Chronicle and 2 other newspapers publish a cipher of his creation. More apparently motive-less murders follow. When a San Francisco cab driver is shot, SFPD detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) find themselves on the Zodiac case. Meanwhile, Chronicle editorial writer Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) have taken an interest as well. Difficulties co-coordinating police jurisdictions, overlooked clues, and a cheeky killer hamper the investigation, but a paucity of forensic evidence may prove insurmountable.<br /><br />\\"Zodiac\\" is over 2 ½ hours long and lacks a traditional conflict-climax-resolution plot structure. It plods on at a languorous, almost dreamy pace, just as the Zodiac investigation proceeded, in fits and starts, for 3 decades. The film follows the case from 1969 to 1991, spending most of its time in the 1970s when evidence was still being uncovered. This is essentially a procedural, reminiscent of post-War docudramas, that takes us step-by-step through the investigation with the aid of many date stamps -which are necessary to achieve coherence given the time lapses and duration of the Zodiac case. \\"Zodiac\\" departs from docudrama tradition, however, in its frustrated, often clueless protagonists and in its conclusion. David Fincher's presentation is thoughtful and provocative but requires patience. This was reflected in dismal box office receipts, but \\"Zodiac\\" is better suited to home viewing.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2007): There are no bonus features on this DVD, but a Director's Cut with an audio commentary, interviews with investigators, detailed analysis of the crimes, behind-the-scenes features, and more will be released in 2008.

B00005ATQF|4.0|What can you say about this film?  It's a sobering look into basic training for the Marines, with a gunnery Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermy) whose drill instructor are not too far behind him.  The insults and barking orders rolls off his tongue like second nature.  This film is really quite a classic among 20-45 males. It's funny at times when it probably shouldn't be.  You kind of start laughing until you realize just exactly what is going on.  The Marine Drill Sargeant Hartman tears these young privates into pieces and builds them up the Marine Way... except for one private, private Pyle (Vincent Deoferno) who is transformed in a way no drill sergeant wants to see.  The movie has a lot of unnecessary shock factor seems in it.  Much of it seems like a lot of scenes with no direction, but for some reason you want to see it over and over.  Not a movie for the squeamish.  Must see for most heterosexual men... ladies don't tend to like full metal jacket.  Can't figure out why..lol
0385334206|4.0|Breakfast Of Champions seems to stand alone in the Vonnegut canon. It is a bizarre piece of product that never really settles into, or onto anything. It's a depressed, cynical, psychedelic mishmash that offers KV's pithy comments on the state of the globe-flinging sarcastic barbs at issues like heredity, free will, racism, schizophrenia, corporatism, nationalism, alcoholism, war, the penal system, suicide, homosexuality, modern art, and the nature of writing itself. And so on.     It's entirely possible that this kitchen-sink fiction was Kurt's attempt to say everything he wanted to say in an epigrammatic fashion without having to tie it too tightly to a meaningful story. It's also entirely plausible that he was suffering from depression and near-madness when he produced this; it is not a friendly or happy book, though it is quite funny.     I'd not be foolish enough to compare this to greatness. But it's a perfect entryway into a different perspective on what is happening on this bizarre ball of green and blue. All half-bright teenagers should read this book; all still-bright adults should return to it and find that things haven't changed since 1973 and we could use a good snicker about the way the world is ordered.     Everyone who knows Vonnegut knows he can write a good novel. If you want to see that writer take a curette to his brain and basically explode from all the hatred and inhumanity and senselessness he sees, then Breakfast Of Champions is where it's at.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Jack Nicholson is awesome in this film.  So is Diane Keaton.  Screen chemistry is perfect and they are both believable.  It's cute, funny, hilarious at times and you really get the feeling that Nicholson and Keaton are not acting.  The movie is a little bit long, but you don't really notice it.  Something is always happening in the movie makes you care.  Francis McDermond plays Keaton's sister and really fits the character.  I think this movie is great and I would recommend it to anyone over 25 years old.  I'm not sure anybody under 25 would actually get it... perhaps I'm not being fair to the x generation... sorry.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I first saw this movie when it came out years ago.  I loved it then and I love it now!  If you are a fan of ballet, dance, and Baryshnikov it is a must have!  The story follows the era of the Russian Cold War and the isolation its dancers went through.  It is a likely story for its time with dancers being controlled by a harsh government, people wanting to escape the life of poverty and government control, and finding freedom somehow.  To watch Baryshnikov dance in anything is wonderful!
006072448X|5.0|This book was unlike anything I have ever read. In the beginning it took a little while to get used to the authors expansive vocabulary, but once it clicked for me I couldn't wait to read more. The story is told in a series of letters and although that sounds difficult to read it was actually a very clever concept. You are immediately on the mother's side from the birth of Kevin and it is an wonderful look from the her perspective. I thought about this book for days after reading it and was disappointed when I finished it (only because it was over). I would highly recommend this book - it will leave you feeling haunted, but it is very fulfilling throughout and the end leaves you with complete closure.

B000OCXF0Q|4.0|Avril Lavigne's first album was something of a phenomenon, spawning three Top 10 singles that dominated pop radio, jumpstarting a wave of spunky Canadian rocker chicks in the music industry, ushering in what was more or less a new era of teen pop, and creating a seemingly endless legion of bratty, bubblegum-bashing, tie-wearing tweens. The album's appeal was blindingly evident upon first listen-Lavigne's music was armed with a slew of soaring, nagging hooks, assisted greatly by songwriting giants The Matrix. Her lyrics were fun and vaguely relatable to the teen audience, but consistently silly and shallow. She was a loveable brat, basically, and this was marketed as her primary appeal. Her second album, however, displayed the typically teenage attempt at growth. It was darker, moodier, more awkward, and significantly less peppy. Although many fans responded to it well, since it displayed the awkward older teen phase perfectly in many aspects (and at times bought into the `goth' trend of the time), it lacked anything quite as exciting or infectious as \\"Sk8er Boi\\" or \\"Complicated,\\" and ultimately spawned only one significant hit in the U.S. After her marriage and the out-of-nowhere adult contemporary success of the startlingly mature \\"Keep Holding On,\\" one would think Avril would continue down the path of genuine maturity, at last, and release an album no one would have expected. Well, `The Best Damn Thing' may not be what you'd expect, but not for that particular reason. It is in some ways a regression of sorts, full of lyrics just as childish and silly-sometimes even more so-as the ones on her debut. It is in other ways a return to form and what Lavigne ultimately does best-big, bratty, anthemic power pop. \\"Girlfriend,\\" the lead single and her first #1 hit in the states, is an infectious, addictive romp that brilliantly meshes arena rock with upbeat hip-pop. Don't listen to the lyrics-they're meant to be danced to, not listened to-and you'll discover one of the verybest songs she's ever recorded. \\"I Can Do Better\\" is the same, boasting a soaring, singalong chorus you'll be eager to bitchily shout at your last ex. \\"Runaway\\" is a bit more acoustic-sounding, but still has the same breezy, fun, `let go' vibe of the previous two. The title track once again has Avril experimenting with hip-pop-lite in the verses, with a snarky kiss-off cheerleader chant of a chorus. Like her past two albums, there is a batch of hook-driven ballads, tailor-made for radio play. In the case of `TBDT,' they are \\"When You're Gone,\\" \\"Innocence,\\" and \\"Keep Holding On.\\" Avril tends to sound a little sappy and vaguely unconvincing when she goes into ballad mode, but the three ballads (and yes, there are only three) are actually all great songs. Each is blessed with a strong, memorable hook, gorgeous instrumentation and genuinely appealing vocals. \\"Hot\\" is Avril's first real attempt at musical sensuality, and it's much more convincing and appealing than you'd think. \\"I Don't Have To Try,\\" meanwhile, is so ferociously cocky that Kanye West should be taking notes, but it can be paired with \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"I Can Do Better\\" as one of the straight-up rockers here, and is consequently one of the biggest standouts. Also like \\"Girlfriend,\\" it contains a unique blend of hip-poppy verses and an enormously catchy arena rock chorus. There are definitely a few misfires-\\"Everything Back But You\\" is laughable and un-catchy upon first listen, but it may become a bratty, messy guilty pleasure to some listeners over time. \\"One Of Those Girls\\" is bland and filler-ish, and won't manage to click with most listeners. \\"Contagious\\" is alright; most reviewers seem to have found it hooky, but it doesn't utilize Avril's mid-tempo capabilities like \\"Hot\\" does. Bizarrely, the album was not released in `explicit' and `clean' formats, but instead featured as an `original version' (which edits all cussing and explicit lyrics) and a more expensive `Deluxe Edition' (which leaves all lyricsuncut and contains some bonus material). The Deluxe Edition is the way to go for hardcore fans, since it boasts the original, unedited lyrics, an extra DVD with a making-of movie (which shows you just how drunk Avril actually was when she recorded this album, and reveals she is indeed just as bratty as she was when she first came out), a booklet full of the songs' lyrics and great pictures, and frankly a slightly more attractive cover picture. Get the original version (with the white, not pink, background) if you're a casual fan and/or don't mind edited lyrics. It's really a shame that \\"Alone,\\" the b-side of the \\"Girlfriend\\" single wasn't included on the album, because it's an excellent song and in fact outranks some of the ones actually included. Overall, the album is a nonstop dance-rock romp that will be great fun to blast out of car stereos, but likely won't satisfy the audience that had hoped for more actual growth or a second `Under My Skin.'
B000R8YC18|4.0|I didn't see this movie until thirty years after it's release, but that's fine by me.  I don't think I could have handled it in my teens or even my twenties.    DeNiro is wonderful as Travis Bickle.  The world has already worn at him, and we see it wearing at him further at each stage of the movie.  When he tells the Presidential Candidate that the whole city needs to be cleaned up, we feel his emotion.    The one bright point of his life seemed to be the character played by Cybill Shepherd.  This is the part that got me out of my chair.  When he convinced her to go to a movie with him and then took her to a porno film, I said \\"What was he thinking?\\"  Then it hit me - he isn't thinking the way I think.  This man thinks on a parallel plane to the rest of the society he sees.  And even that type of thinking devolves into a form of psychosis as the film progresses.    One more point.  Other reviewers have seen DeNiro's character as a vigilante who got fed up with the scum pushers and pimps.  I will only buy that to a point.  Remember, this is a guy who armed himself to the teeth, practiced dry-firing his guns at the television and was set on assasination.  There was as much trouble inside him as there was on the streets he loathed so much.
B000OVLBF8|2.0|Was when my dog farted.  There were shouts and horrified gasps.  It was by far the most lively reaction in the room.  Other than that this movie was a snorefest.  First off, Nicolas Cage is so ugly and dopey looking, aside from some parts where he was suppose to be dopey he came off really bad and just the wrong person for the role.  Satan is a loser who seem to give powers to people yet is too weak to stop them once they decide to run off with them.  So he throws hissy fits and walk around like he's actually doing something.  Satan's son is an even bigger loser than his father. Seriously, who gives a &$%@# if they are having a family quarrel over some scroll?  They ever really set up how important it is to the story.  Not to mention that neither Satan's son nor the other demon punk band members who were hanging with him were any kind of a real threat.  He just defeated them all so easily.  Then we have the love interest.  But why is she a love interest?  She pines over a guy who ditches her then stands her up.  What reason does she have to form any kind of attachment to this wet noodle, dopey looking man.<br /><br />Anyone want to know what Ghost Rider is all about, here it is;  Boy sells his soul accidently to the devil cause he finds out his father has cancer, the cancer is cured then his father dies in a firey accident.  Boy pouts and ditches his girlfriend as he rides off to become a dopey looking man who does stunts like his father, Satan's son and the brat pack gang show up and decide they want some scroll Satan was too slow to get from a old guy on horseback.  Since Satan is too much of a loser to put his retard son in his place he turns dopey man into a Ghost rider, suddenly dopey guy is satisfied with being turned into a skeleton with fire shooting out of its head (although that skeleton look WAY better than dopey looking Nicolas Cage, I was actually disappointed when he kept going back to his regular self), the police and everyone he comes in contact with seem to think it's normal to chase around a skeleton that's on fire.  Anyway, dopey man seeks help from the old man on horseback who took the scroll. For some reason, although he's been guarding it for years he has no problems handing it over to dopey man.  Then the producers add in a scene of the motorcyle Ghost rider and the horseback Ghost rider riding side-by-side, old and new, past and present....then horseback Ghost rider leaves cause the scene was over.  Seriously, horseback rider's departing words might as well had been; \\"That was a cool shot, now I should go back to my trailer.\\"<br /><br />So stupid Satan's son, who is so happy Ghost rider's soul repentance couldn't work on him because he has no soul, decides that he's going to get thousands of souls put into his body.  Because it's so smart to put a bunch of souls into your body to fight a guy who can burn souls.  Then once he's gone satan comes back to reclaim his power back and dopey man says \\"no\\" and Satan throws a hissy fit cause for some reason he can't just take it back cause he's Satan.  Then Nicloas Cage's ugly mug is plastered on my screen with a raised eye brow before he turns cute again.  Cause face it, that Skeleton thing looked way better than him.think it's normal to chase around a skeleton that's on fire.

0316010669|4.0|Blink is about the first reactions you have to things. Whether it is your first impression of a new co-worker or your gut instinct on the court, these quick contemplations have serious repercussions in our subsequent actions.    If you think about that for a minute, you'll realize that the better your first impressions/gut instincts are, the better you will have positioned yourself for further action. Gladwell manages to take this one idea and fill it out to almost 300 pages. Not to spoil the book for you, but the premise is simply that the better you've trained yourself (priming), the more appropriate your \\"blinks\\" will be. Bad or no priming leads to poor initial reactions. Good priming leads to good initial reactions.    There are a lot of allusions to real research, but no real research is presented. There are lots of anecdotes, but anecdotes are just helpful stories. On the surface, this book would seem to be a loser.    What makes this book worthwhile is not its single insight. Rather, it is Gladwell's writing itself that keeps the reader interested. His breezy manner is welcoming and enjoyable. His recounting of anecdotes is interesting and funny. He never hesitates to put himself in the middle of the action, so we readers never feels like we're standing too far from the topic at hand.    I liked the book, and took away from it its singular lesson. If you like this kind of pop psychology, you'll really like this book. It's accessible for anyone with a few hours to spare. 4 stars for a readable and enjoyable lesson in quick thinking.

0143036556|5.0|Why do some societies at the peak of their greatness collapse? What can we learn from past societies that collapsed?    By collapse, the author means a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a considerable area, for an extended time (p. 3). He arrived at a five-point framework of possible contributing factors. Four of those sets of factors--environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, and loss of friendly trade partners--may or may not prove significant for a particular society. The fifth set of factors--the society's responses to its environmental problems--always proves significant (p. 11).    The society of Easter Island is as close as we get to a `pure' ecological collapse, in this case due to total deforestation that led to war, overthrow of the elite, construction of the famous stone statues, and a massive population die-offs. In order to build their gigantic stone statues and for its rulers to maintain their high standard of living, the inhabitants of Easter island cut their trees, and in the process, destroyed the forest and all of its inhabitants. The few remaining Easter islanders who survived after this environmental collapse became cannibals and were dying of starvation when the Europeans discovered their island. Why would the Easter islanders allow themselves to reach such a destitute state? Why didn't they stop cutting the trees before it was too late, and implemented a reforestation program? Why didn't they build seafaring ships to import wood from other islands or continents (obviously with all their forest disappearing they couldn't build any ships)?     How did the Easter islander who cut the last remaining tree on the island feel? Jared Diamond explains how hard it must have been for the Eater islanders to actually notice their forests shrinking. People get used to a certain scenery or panorama, and it becomes the norm. As the forest is halved in size, the next generation will view the size of the forest as the norm, and will not notice that indeed it has shrunk in size. Today, most of the animals on our planet have been driven to extinction, yet we still view the diversity of the animal life on our planet as the norm, not realizing that a few hundred years ago the number of different species on our planet was probably double what it is today.    The author gives as examples other societies that have collapsed. The rulers of the Mayan empire, the most advanced Native American society, also destroyed their environment in order to build their palaces and live their luxurious lifestyle, with little regard to their population of tens of millions or the environment. We see this today in many of the Arab and African nations, where leaders live at the expense of their citizens and live a life as if there were no tomorrow or a God, and in the process having little regard for the environment. Many African countries, as well as China, are on the verge of an irreversible environmental collapse. Will these nations end up like Easter Island?    The Chaco Anasazi society also collapsed because of deforestation and problems of water management. The society flourished from about A.D. 600 for more than five centuries, until it disappeared sometime between 1150 and 1200. It was a completely organized, geographically extensive, regionally integrated society that erected the largest buildings in pre-Columbian North America (p. 143). When the Anasazi began diverting water into channels for irrigation, the concentration of water runoff in the channels and the clearing of vegetation for agriculture, combined with natural processes, resulted around A.D. 900 in the cutting of deep arroyos in which the water level was below field levels, thereby making irrigation agriculture and also agriculture based on groundwater impossible until the arroyos filled up again (p. 144-145). Today, China is facing similar problems of water management. China has become the number one nation in number of dams, with over 40,000 dams to date. These dams are destroying the ecosystem within China itself and its neighboring countries, like Mongolia; severely affecting cities downstream; and causing political unrest by depriving some neighboring countries, like Vietnam, of water.    Haiti is a great example of a collapsed society. Haiti is totally destroyed with no means of redemption. Its natural resources have been completely depleted. There are many reasons, but the two main ones are its ruthless and blood-thirsty rulers who ransacked the country for their selfish gain and the fact that its population is now too large for its land space and remaining resources.     Why did the Norse who settled in Greenland fail, while the natives, the Inuit, did not? The Greenland Norse were not acclimated to the harsh winters of Greenland. When they first settled, the temperatures were still warm. The cold seasons, however, proved to be very harsh for them. Furthermore, the Greenland Norse never learnt the seal hunting techniques of the Inuit, missing out on an important source of protein. The Inuit dug holes in the ice, and waited behind an ice mound for a seal to come out to breath. The Inuit had to strike the seal with a spear from behind the mound, without seeing the seal, and without the seal seeing them. They would know of the seal's presence from the sound it made as it came out for air. This is a difficult hunting technique the Greenland Norse never learnt. In the Norse's case, the environment they lived in, and the failure to adapt, was the cause of their collapse.    Some societies were on the verge of collapse but recovered. One such case is Japan. Japan almost destroyed its forests, but quickly realized its mistake and went on an intensive reforestation program. Its environment helped it tremendously. Its soil, fed by the many volcanoes, is rich in plant nutrients, and as a result, trees in Japan grow much faster than in other areas of the world. The frequent rainfalls also provide abundant water to its forests. Furthermore, Japan is a spiritual country with great respect and admiration for its natural environment. Destroying entire forests, unlike the Easter Islanders, was just not an option for its spiritually wise leaders. Japan's spiritual doctrines therefore also contributed greatly to its recovery from near total environmental collapse. Rulers therefore play a major role on whether societies fail or succeed. If Africa and the Arab countries should be blessed one day with wise, unselfish and uncorrupt leaders, their fate might change and their societies might once again flourish. It is sad to think how so few cause pain and misery to so many. It just takes one great leader to turn a nation around. Similarly, it takes just one evil leader to destroy an entire nation. For example, collapses have already materialized for Somalia and Rwanda. No need to give more examples; they are all around us!    The author also gives examples of present day societies on the verge of collapse. He cites China as a prime example. China is destroying its environment at an alarming rate in order to sustain its growth. It has very limited natural water, with its once mighty Yellow River now dry for almost 200 days out of the year. Its cities are the most polluted in the world. Furthermore, China receives money from foreign governments to bury their toxic waste. It is not uncommon to see Chinese people wearing masks in the streets to protect their lungs against the world's worst urban air pollution. Furthermore, massive erosion has ruined large areas of the Loess Plateau in China. For more on the environmental impacts of China on the world and its eventual demise read Peter Navarro's `The Coming China Wars.'    Australia, with the world's most fragile environment, is another country on the verge of collapse. It too has destroyed its environment by human folly and by the introduction of alien animals. The plague of introduced rabbits andsheep that consume vegetation led to erosion. Australia is now among the countries considering the most radical restructuring of its society, in order to solve its environmental problems. One interesting fact is that if Australia is to minimize its effects on global warming, it must kill all its cows. Its cows produce so much methane that they are a major contributor to global warming. Will the Australian government slaughter all its cows in order to save our planet?    The processes through which past societies have undermined themselves by damaging their environments fall into eight categories: deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems (erosion, salinization, and soil fertility losses), water management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species on native species, human population growth, and increased per-capita impact on people (p. 6). The environmental problems facing us today include the same eight that undermined past societies, plus four new ones: human-caused climate change, buildup of toxic chemicals in the environment, energy shortages, and full human utilization of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity. Most of these 12 threats, it is claimed, will become globally critical within the next few decades (p. 7).    Our planet now has become like one nation. Globalization makes it impossible for modern societies to collapse in isolation, as did Easter Island and the Greenland Norse in the past. Pollution in China affects the whole world, as the jet stream transports this pollution worldwide. Cutting trees will affect us all, since trees produce the world's oxygen. Furthermore, Global warming will affect the whole planet, not just some isolated countries with the most pollutants and gas emissions. Any society in turmoil today, no matter how remote--think of Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq as examples--can cause trouble for prosperous societies on other continents. The problem facing us today is not which countries will fail or succeed, but whether our planet will collapse. For the first time in history, we face the risk of a global decline. We must therefore all work together to save our planet, or we will all fail.
B00006EXL5|5.0|this is an amazing album, It was so my money worth.. even more :]  Im glad i bought it.
0141439475|5.0|For those who only think of movie images when they recall Frankenstein, this book will serve as a pleasant and refreshing experience.  The gothic undertones lend authenticity to this beautiful story.  When I first began to read this book, I was expecting horror and terrifying elements that may have inspired authors like Stephen King.  However, I was amazed at just how beautifully deep and inspiring the book actually was.<br /><br />There is no need for me to rehash the plot because others who have reviewed have done this, but they failed to mention just how many levels there are to this book.  The whole story is based on relationships; those between creator and creature, man and nature, science and morality, familial relationships, etc.  It is full of concepts such as existentialism, religion, philosophy, family, society (and the shallow, narrow-mindedness of society), and so on.  For such a short work, it really covers a large range of human experience.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite book.  It left me feeling hopeful and inspired and I recommend it to just about anyone.
B00005U1YO|4.0|A lot of mixed reviews on this album by The Chemical Brothers.  That always seems to happen when an artist(s)'s sound and/or style changes even slightly.  This is the case with \\"Come with Us\\".  Unmistakeably by The Chemical Brothers, but unmistakeably a different feel than all their previous albums.    I don't consider any of the ten tracks to be flops, but at the same time, only a couple are really great.  \\"Star Guitar\\" and \\"The State We're In\\" are my top selections from this better than average effort by the infamous Brothers of electronica.  Despite this, I'm still very satisfied that I have it in my collection.    3.5/5 stars.

This is something special... please give it a try if you haven't already.  and keep it metal!!!!!

B00005JPQL|5.0|Once upon a time there was a young man named Dunstan Thorn who lived in the English town of Wall.  The name came from the wall that separates the town from what to Dustan's young eyes appears to be a field, but what is revealed to be the magical land of Stormhold when the young man ventures through the guarded hole in the wall.  There he meets a princess, held in slavery to a witch.  Dustan returns home and nine months later a baby boy is delivered to his doorstep.  Named Tristan (Charlie Cox), eighteen years later it is his turn to go through the hole in the wall to bring back a fallen star to win the heart of Victoria (Sienna Miller), the girl he loves.  What Tristan does not know when he begins his quest is that the fallen star in a young woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes) and that the quest is complicated by Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), one of a trio of witches who want to cut out the heart of the fallen star as a source of power, and the remaining princes of the late king of Stormhold (Peter O'Toole), who seek the necklace Yvaine wears to secure their claim to the throne.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is adapted from the [[ASIN:1401211909 illustrated novel]] by Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess, which is prefaced with John Donne's \\"A Song,\\" the opening line of which is \\"Goe, and catche a falling starre.\\"  Gaiman amd Vess are best known for their work on the [[ASIN:1401210821 Sandman]] comic book.  But this 2007 movie is of a different suit, and the book's subtitle, \\"Being a Romance Within the Realms of Faerie,\\" really does aptly describe the nature of the tale.  I have heard several comparisons of \\"Stardust\\" to \\"[[ASIN:B00005LOKQ The Princess Bride]],\\" and while I understand the impulse the analog only hurts this film.  Written by William Goldman, \\"The Princess Bride\\" is one of the most quoted movies of all time, up there on the highest plateau with \\"[[ASIN:B00009W0WM Casablanca]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0001NBNB6 The Godfather]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000ADS63K The Wizard of Oz)]].\\"  \\"Stardust\\" might have some strong parallels in terms of plot, but it is pretty much devoid of memorable one-liners.  The villains might be a tad more interesting than the heroes,<br /><br />In the end I round up on \\"Stardust\\" for several reasons.  First, there are the performances by Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro, both of whom evince some of the smoothest scene stealing you have seen in some time.  Once you see this movie you will understand why people are raving but talking cryptically about De Niro in this film (and why people are thinking Oscar nomination for supporting actor).  There is also much talk about how Pfeiffer is willing to look like a hag, but since she is playing a hag and it was clear years ago that Pfeiffer was a serious actress, it seems rather insulting to compliment her on doing the job right.  Second, the story clearly sets up an inevitable duel between Tristan and his nemesis back in Wall, but after the obvious set up we get something quite unconventional when the big swordplay moment in the film arrives.  Finally, I was happy that I anticipated what would achieve the requistie happy ending in the final big battle, which was not totally predictable but certainly well set up by what happens before hand.<br /><br />Actually there were lots of small things that I liked in this film, from Ian McKellan's narration and David Kelly's guard of the hole in the wall to the fact that not all of the slaughtered princes go down without a fight and that there were several moments that made me laugh out loud in a theater with only a couple dozen people in attendance.  Add all of these things up and \\"Stardust\\" is not a great film, but it is certainly very good.  This year will provide us with what might be the biggest onslaught of fantasy films to date in movie history, from \\"[[ASIN:B00005JPI0 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]\\" to \\"[[ASIN:B00005JPNW His Dark Materials: The Golden Compass]],\\" and when all is said and done \\"Stardust\\" might be one of the best of thebunch.  Hopefully word of mouth will sustain this film and it can build on the relatively paltry $9.17 million it made its first week.word of mouth will sustain this film and it can build on the relatively paltry $9.17 million it made its first week.
0439813786|5.0|I didn't know what I was going to do now that I have finished the Harry Potter series.  Thank the stars for Hugo Cabret!  This feels like old-fashioned storytelling done in this remarkable new artistic style.  The look of this book is out of this world;from the black pages, to the beautifully rendered drawing sequences, to the unusual and haunting jacket design.  I loved it all.  The story moves quickly and keeps you guessing, and provides some seeds to spark research on several different subjects; from Paris, to early cinema, museum history, Clockmakers, Magicians...and on.  A very special book.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|What can a red-blooded, married American male say about \\"The Holiday\\"?  What started out as perhaps an interesting plot idea - two people switch houses and find happiness in each other's lives - quickly took a left turn.  My wife sticks this thing into the DVD player and about two minutes later I was already beaten down by the corny dialogue and terrible wooden acting.  Now, I can appreciate a good chick-flick as much as the next guy.  I kinda like \\"Father of the Bride\\", \\"Legally Blonde\\", even \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\".  But this thing stinks to high heaven.    Every one of the main actors was as bad as Jake Lloyd in \\"The Phantom Menace\\" (Yipee!), and Diaz was especially atrocious.  I can only assume that George Lucas had some hand in this, since Winslet, Law, and Black are usually really fun to watch.  Maybe they suffer because of the ridonkulous lines they had to deliver.  It's like watching a Sweet Valley High book played out on film.    Go spend your money on something better than this.  Like a junior-high production of \\"Death of a Salesman\\".
B000TEUSJU|5.0|If you go to the Image entertainment web site, and look at the actual box art of the Imperial edition (very top of box) you will see that this is definetly coming out as a three disc edition - apparently the fourth disc was to be a complete soundtrack of the film but got pulled due to legal reasons.Lets hope that amazon take this into account and reduce the price of the box set accordingly.Great film by the way - hope this really is the 210 version as it can finally set the record straight as to all the rumours of what was cut out.Would be nice if the long version was also cleaned up and doesn't come out later on remastered as another cash in scheme for the dvd releasing company.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|When I first saw this film I took for what it was, a horror film nothing more and nothing less. The plot seems original to a certain point. There's an elite group of people who pay into an organized crime syndicate that kidnaps young tourists for torture. The elite members of the group pay to torture these hapless victims to death. The costs of this form of sadistic entertainment depends on the nationality of the victims. Americans cost more as it is probably more difficult to kidnap them without the authorities noticing. That's the plot basically and the rest is basically what amounts to a snuff film. However the premise could make for an interesting tv series, on premium cable of course. I found the film enjoyable not just because of the gore (there's a dandling eyeball gag in here) but because of the idea of an organization like the one protrayed actually existing. It's not that farfetched considering what's going on in the world now. Anyway the film wasn't as gory as say a Fulci or Argento film. Most Italian horror films show the same amount of gore in 10 minutes of the film where Hostel showed in over 124 minutes. Seeing this film for the first time, I want to see the sequel though I've heard it was not well received. Hey, I think Roth is aiming for a particular audience of gore afficianos. Ditto for the High Brow critics. An after dinner meal for gore nuts.
B000RIHBIE|4.0|I have been a Sum 41 fan since Half Hour Of Power, and I have loved every single CD they have made. Through the years of listening to them I liked their progression they made with their CDs, until this CD came out. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good CD. But when you compare it to Does This Look Infected? or Chuck, it doesn't even compare. The fast songs on this are great, but almost half the CD is slow songs. Songs like Underclass Hero, King Of Contradiction, Confusion and Frustration in Modern Times, March of the Dogs, and Pull The Curtain are great, energetic, fast, melodic punk songs. I think that King Of Contradiction is the best song on the CD, it sounds a lot like Welcome To Hell from Chuck. Then there are other slow songs like Speak of the Devil, Dear Father, Best Of Me, With Me, Look At Me, Count Your Last Blessings (sort of), and So Long Goodbye are all slow and bring the CD down. It's not that they are bad songs, I actually like them, but they aren't as good as the others. I am a punk fan, so I think that Does This Look Infected? is their best CD, followed by Chuck. They said that this CD would be more punk rock and I don't why they would say that because it is their least punk CD yet. I really hope that their next CD has more punk and rock influences than this CD which is watered down by so many slow songs.

When one sits back to relish in the musical experience known as `FutureSex/LoveSounds' they are in for a number of surprises, all of which are set to blow the listeners mind.<br /><br />The first surprise is that this artist is none other than Justin Timberlake, the same blonde haired kid who sang high pitched lead for the boy-band N'Sync a few years back.  There is no trace of that teenager anywhere to be found on the thirteen-track disc.  In fact, he's so grown up it's hard to really classify this as pop.  I guess that's why they coined the phrase `dirty-pop', a style of which Timberlake is the current King (sorry Ne-Yo, you aint got nothin' on Timberlake).  The second surprise is that this is not the R&B album you may have expected judging from the success of his debut solo album `Justified'.  In fact, Justin has enlisted the help of Producer Timbaland to create an album that surpasses genre classification altogether.  There are some R&B laced tracks, some hip-hop influenced numbers, some techno club cuts, some pop vibes and even a jazzed up ballad and every track sounds just as polished and effortless as the previous.<br /><br />Timberlake starts things off with the title track `FutureSexLoveSound' and he sure sets things off right.  The technoesque beats laden with Timberlake's seductive vocals are brilliantly controlled and used to perfection.  It's apparent from the very beginning that this is a very different and unexpected experience, but one intriguing enough to demand our attention.  Timbaland is in true form here, as he is in the first single `SexyBack' which is in my opinion the song of the year.  Who knew that Timberlake had it in him?  With an infectious beat, one of the greatest in recent years, some simple yet effectively perverse lyrics and a few well timed F-bombs Timberlake transcended from teenage girl fantasy to well established artist.  `SexyBack' will always be remembered as Justin's redefining moment, and we all love his new definition.<br /><br />Justin finds familiar territory on a few tracks, one in particular being his second single `My Love' which also features rap artist T.I.  The beat is brilliantly composed.  Timbaland is truly just as responsible as Timberlake for this masterful album.  Timberlake hits his famous falsettos here and they are even better than remembered.  `What Goes Around' also hits all the right moves with the Oriental guitars to accompany an effortlessly catchy chorus, not to mention one of the best overall music videos I've ever seen...it's a shame that's not included on the CD.  `Summer Love' also gives Justin fans something to smile at, this time giving Timberlake the opportunity to spitfire his lyrics to a brutal beat.<br /><br />And speaking of brutal beats, the hip-hop influenced `Chop Me Up' is brilliantly constructed.  Justin slips right into character and is as convincing as can be, his words sliding over the crunchy beat.  Three Six Mafia contribute decently, although they are upstaged by the brilliant change in musical arrangement which adds a nice spin to the track.  `Sexy Ladies' has a very 80's feel to it, with deep bass lines and high strings giving it a very `funky' feel.  `Damn Girl' also carries with it traces of funk with Will.i.am offering his help, but he fails to stack up to Timberlake, which I didn't expect.  `Pose' closes the album as a bonus track, and I can understand why it wasn't selected as part of the official album itself.  It's carefree and probably the most `Pop' sounding track here but I think because of that fact it comes off a bit immature and doesn't quite mesh with the balance of the album.  The inclusion of Snoop was a nice touch, but can't in itself save the track entirely.<br /><br />`LoveStoned' may very well be the best track here.  The beat is catchy as all getout and the lyrics are classic Justin.  It's one of these songs that never grows tired and has this infectious way of inducing movement in the listener.  `Losing my Way' is Justin's attempt at inspiration, singing about life changing experiences, battling substance abuse and making something of yourself instead of giving into vices.  It's decent, but nothing near what he was attempting to accomplish.  His two ballads are both great in their own respect, `Until the End of Time' sounding like it was taking straight from a 90's R&B album, but it's `All Over Again' that really delivers the goods, giving us an almost John Mayer feeling, soft and subtle and jazzy in it's own respect with some of Justin's best vocal's to date, beautiful and elegant and memorable to a T.<br /><br />So, in closing, `FutureSex/LoveSounds' is a fantastic album, that while not perfect is actually very close to it and adds layers to the sensation that is Justin Timberlake, paving the way for him to enter the living room of just about every home, finally transcending the ties of the `Popstar' curse and becoming a musical icon.It's one of these songs that never grows tired and has this infectious way of inducing movement in the listener.  `Losing my Way' is Justin's attempt at inspiration, singing about life changing experiences, battling substance abuse and making something of yourself instead of giving into vices.

B000NQR7NO|2.0|Arctic Monkeys' debut album was so intensely good, this album was one of the most anticipated records of the year for me. The anticipation was only amplified upon the hearing of the first new single, Brainstorm, which sounds like it could've been one of the best tracks from Whatever People Think We Are. And that song delivered as the opener, but I kept growing more and more disenchanted over the course of the album. By the last song, I realized, \\"I didn't like this album at all!\\" The songs are meandering, laborious, and boring, taking all that was good about the Monkeys, all the energy and attitude, and throwing it away for irritatingly listless atmospheric ventures.<br /><br />This is a classic case of Sophomore Slump. Let's hope they come back with a third disc as mindblowing as their first!
B00000DC10|1.0|I enjoy some of the early hardcore bands from the 80s - Black Flag, Minor Threat, Rites of Spring, and so forth - and have for a while, but I'm not especially familiar with later forms of hardcore.  After seeing a number of extremely positive reviews for this album, I figured it was time to change that.  Unfortunately, I bought this CD without hearing it first, and realizing how far it is from what I hoped it would be.  The hardcore I know is all about raw emotion, and the glossy metal-like guitars and screamed vocals don't manage to carry it in quite the same way.  This may just be me, but I can't manage to establish an emotional connection to a singer who doesn't sound like a human being.  The screaming that features in nearly every song here goes straight past the limit of relatable emotion into the absurd.    That's not to say that the emotion isn't there - it's clear from the start that this record's element is anger, and specifically, anger about capitalism.  I don't doubt that this emotion is genuine, but I can't find any reason to sympatize with it.  The music doesn't encourage me, as I said, and while the band's revolutionary politics may have appealed to me when I was 17, they don't seem so enticing to my more jaded brain, especially given the band's excessive sincerity.  Down with capitalism.  We know, we know.  At least the Minutemen had a sense of humor about their politics.    But perhaps I'm missing something.  I probably am, but I'm not very inclined to listen to this album any more.  If you dig the politics, then this album may be worth a look.  If you're a fan of the 90s incarnation of hardcore, then by all means, check this album out.  Perhaps it will be your Zen Arcade.  (Which, if you don't remember, was a big deal back in '84 because it brought acoustic songs and varied instruments into hardcore - how quickly they forget.)  But before you buy, make sure you know what you're getting yourself into.  This album's appeal is not as self-evident as many of the other reviews here would have you think.

031286504X|5.0|For those than haven't read the book: You can read this review in it's entirety, I give nothing away...<br /><br />This book is outstanding. Period.<br /><br />A contemporary classic. The template for many works, both written and filmed. Eventhough you've no doubt read or seen something inspired by this, \\"I Am Legend\\" will be as fresh and riveting a read as it was back in 1952 when it was first published.<br /><br />By the way, don't let its age discourage you from reading it either. There is absolutely nothing in this book that is dated or that is so different from today that it will take you out of the story (aside from a flashback the main character has about talking to a \\"Negro\\" at work).<br /><br />A reoccuring complaint that I've been reading is that it's hard to tell when \\"I Am Legend\\" ends and the compilation of short stories this book has afterward, begin. I have to admit I laughed out loud when I read that. HOW OLD ARE THESE PEOPLE? What are they in, KINDERGARDEN? Excuse my language, but how stupid do you have to be to not know that the main story is over? Didn't the big, bold title \\"BURIED TALENTS\\", of the new story give you a hint?<br /><br />Plus, if you couldn't tell that \\"I Am Legend\\" had ended, then you weren't really paying attention to it. BOLDLY printed title aside, you should be aware that \\"I Am Legend\\" has ended simply by what you're reading.<br /><br />This one-star reviewer even goes on about how the movies sucked but said nothing about the book. Amazon really needs to screen these reviews.<br /><br />The story doesn't end abruptly either. Yes it's a short story, but its end came at just the right speed and with a lot of closure. The end was phenomenal. If the book is considered to be in the top 10 horror stories of all time, the ending should defenitely be in the top 3 endings of all time. No other ending I've read has had such a deep impact on me. As I read the last couple of lines, I was completely lost in the story. When it was done, I closed the book, took a deep breath, and sat back to meditate and digest it for awhile. I couldn't get it off my mind for days after that.<br /><br />The one thing I will say is that the end is a bit depressing, but hey, most things in life are.<br /><br />There have been to movie adaptations made in the past. \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" with Vincent Price, and \\"The Omega Man\\" with Charlton Heston. Both of these are O.K. on their own, but don't compare at all to the book. I wonder how this latest depiction with Will Simth will do?<br /><br />Bottom line: This is one of if not THE best novel/novellas of the past century, and undoubtedly one of the top ten horror stories of all time.

0374105235|4.0|A Long Way Gone in an interesting first hand account of a boy soldier during the civil war that plagued Sierra Leone in the early 90's.  The author's tale is a harrowing one as his family life is destroyed, he is pressed into brutal military service and his ultimate rehabilitation.  The non-fiction book reads almost like a novel as we experience each successively horrifying event.  At times I had to pause just to contemplate the heinous acts committed to and by the author and the shock of it all when you realize he is a just a preteen boy for most of it.    The strength of the book lies in it autobiographical nature and the arc Ishmael goes through counter to what most of us experience in the transformation from adolescent to adult.  By the conclusion, we have experienced many highs and lows and this book has numerous tear jerking moments.  The writing is as expected; simple and without literary rhythm but the heartfelt genuine nature of Beah helps you endure it.  Actually my biggest issue with the book is the chaotic nature we are thrown into action without exposition of explanation of the political landscape.  A simple introduction would of helped immensely.  In more experienced hands, this is the kind of material that could make for Nobel Prize literature or Oscar worth cinema.  That being said it gets better as it progresses and is well worth reading if the subject interests you.  This is the type of book many wish our current executive political leaders would read.    One side note is the cover jacket of the book.  The design is criminally misleading as it presents the book in a jovial light and might suggest this is an all ages book.  Honestly this book is inappropriate for mid-teens or lower as it contains detailed realistic descriptions of mass murder, physical mutilation, sexual violence, child drug use and all the intense emotions that go along with it.    Bottom Line:  An extraordinary tale from an inspiring individual.  A short book that isn't for everyone but should be discussed and read by all who might have interest a story about hope.  I recommend doing some Internet research about Sierra Leone before reading it.
B000RIHBIE|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of Sum 41, but I do like this edgy punk rock sound. When I bought this CD, alot of the tracks seemed to mesh together, without a clear break. The 1st song appears to be the best track. If you're debating, I would suggest taking another listen on this site or at your local book store. This CD wasn't bad, but it proves the point that newer doesn't always mean better.
0553383663|5.0|Very interesting read.  The author clearly loves Google but that aside, he covers the story from the start of Google as a research project at Stanford University through to their IPO and after.  The best parts of the book for me was the incubation phase where they thought it was a good idea but needed to figure how to make money off it and turn it into a successful business. Lots of details on the key decisions made along the way but not too many details where you'd get bored reading it.   I appreciated how the author covered this as a business story covering the early investors who believed in the value of the idea to the immensely successful branding of the Google name.  If business and technology companies in interest you, I don't think you'll be disappointed reading this book.
0767802659|3.0|The first time I saw this movie I was completely shocked. Were we supposed to cheer for these cute little Nazis? But I watched it again, and now with the Iraq war on my mind, I see that no we are not supposed to like them. At best they are puppets, at worst they are just blood thirsty frat boys. It is pretty obvious that the bugs have no control over the asteroids that are hurtling through space. It also pretty clear that if you want to kill off the bugs for whatever reason, it would be easier just to nuke the planets. But that would not achieve the goals which seem to be endless propaganda and an outlet for all that pent up hostility that seems to running rampant in this futuristic society. I really feel sorry for the bugs. So OK, I finally got it. I am afraid though that lots of folks don't get it though and think it is just a rolicking good time. That actually disturbs me more than seeing Doogie Howser channeling Mengele.
0765348276|5.0|John Scalzi's \\"Old Man's War\\" is a book I picked up on a whim, and serendipity was doing me a huge favor that day.  Scalzi's universe is plausable, interesting, and filled with the kind of roughneck alien encounters that keeps a reader on their toes.<br /><br />John, the main character, is someone who you begin to care about in a fundamental way.  This empathy occurs almost immediately, and I spent the book rooting for him, hoping he would prevail.  No spoilers, though.<br /><br />Please write more books!
B000067J24|4.0|Penelope Cruz sizzles in her role as Isabella, a charming and seductive chef in a small Brazilian seaside resort called Bahia. She marries Toninho Oliveira (played by Murilo Benecio) who is a initially a waiter and later the owner of the restaurant where she wows the customers with her spicey and delicious original meals. They marry and are ecstatically happy, except there is one issue which complicates their life: Isabella suffers from motion sickness. Unfortunately, her husband Toninho makes one *fatal* mistake due to his frustration based on this issue. When Isabella discovers Toninho's fatal mistake, Isabella chooses to embark on a journey. First, she pays homage to the goddess of the sea in Bahia before leaving on her trip to the USA. She had received many offers of jobs as a chef in the USA and chose to try out her luck in San Francsico ...<br /><br />There, Isabella looks up her childhood friend, Monica, who lives an alternate lifestyle which provides some comical scenes in the film. Other interesting features are the flashbacks to their childhood when Isabella first developed her cooking skills and discovered her talent. In San Francisco, Isabella loses out on a fantastic opportunity to work in 5 star restaurant but amazingly this loss turns out to be a major advantage. She becomes the favorite chef at a cooking school and is discovered by a young television producer. He is enticed not only by Isabella's beauty but also by her delicious food. He sells the network on creating a cooking program where Isabella is the star ... naturally she is an instant success.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Toninho is very lonely in Bahia. He is remorseful for his past behavior and makes some offerings to the goddess of the sea with the hope of reuniting with his wife. He flies to San Francisco and discovers that on a hugely popular TV cooking program , his wife is the main hot and spicey dish on display. He pursues her with highly creative efforts but she resists. In one nearly successful attempt to win her back, he provides the back up music for her cooking program. As executives often do, just when everything is going extremely well, they make some inane decision, in this case it is to change Isabella's television persona for the worse. The film is worth viewing to see the extreme and extraordinary results which alter her program - all with the goal of appealing to a broader spectrum of the audience.<br /><br />This is quite an entertaining adventure where a major dilemma is resolved. One of the reasons the film is so effective is that Cliff, the local TV producer becomes a rival for Isabella's affections, just when Toninho is doing everything in his power to win back his wife for himself. This film is pure fantasy and pure entertainment. It is a pleasure to watch Penelope Cruz who sparkles in her role. Murilo Benicio is also a joy to view but his character is less well developed which is unusual given his popularity in Brazil and his highly skilled acting ability. Mark Feurerstein plays a believable TV producer. Harrold Perrineau, Jr is an amusing cross-dressing drag queen. Overall, the film is quite funny and finishes on a most positive and satisfying note.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|When I first heard that they were making a new 'Die Hard' film I thought to myself \\"darn it there's another movie I can't take my kids to\\" but when I saw that the film had been given a PG-13 I knew at that moment that there was a God and in all his infinite wisdom he had finally allowed a director with talent to contribute a clean film to a series of decent action movies that are tarnished with too much violence and unnecessary curse words; finally the studio will do my job as a parent and I won't have to cover my kids ears and eyes anymore.                 The movie started off great from the start because the genius Len Wiseman (The Wise Man behind the camera, pun totally intended!!!) knows how to build suspense. The Key to building suspense effectively involves taking something that the audience is familiar with and turning it on it's head, and being a casual computer user I can totally relate to hacking into Government computer systems and as a result being blown up by a computer virus sent by a group of unusually organized \\"Cyber Terroists\\". Whether they're cyber or not, there's only one man to take care of terrorists in the movies and his name is John McClane, it's time to shoot some bad guys in the feet and arrest them PG-13 style!!!!          After the awesome opening in which a clueless computer hacker gets blown to bits all over his Mom's living room I was quite put off by the initial pairing of McClane and the not so wisecracking computer hacker, I believe it's a free country and all but I don't want my kids to watch a movie about a gay couple bickering while they're on the run. After the first few homo- erotic minutes of their bantering I was convinced that my two sons would leave the theater kissing each other, but after time I realized that the movie painted a positive portrait of the gay American, whether he be a ruthless cop or an unlucky computer hacker, when you're on the run love just happens, in the movies at least and Bruce Willis and Justin Long share one of the best on the run romances since Sam Peckinpah's 'The Getaway'. Timothy Olypahnt plays the Brilliant villain who isn't afraid to cry, he's raised the stakes higher than they have been in any of the previous 'Die Hard' films, forget the hostages in the Nakatomi, the planes about to crash on the White House lawn or all of New York almost getting blown to pieces, this guy makes all the lights go green at a major intersection and causes quite a few dollars in property damage not to mention a raise in rates for all the insured drivers involved, he also makes it look as if the Stock Market crashes and turns the power out. This guy is ruthless and we the audience can't help but sympathize with Justin Long when he stands and cries in a Police Station realizing how bad things are as tens of people complain to an overworked cop.              A situation this dire requires extreme police procedure by the book and thank you again Mr. Wiseman for not letting smoking, swearing and violence get in the way of what should be nice clean arrests. The problem with the original \\"Die Hards\\" is that the action and violence were played as intense and realistic and unfortunately showed the consequences of violent actions, but thankfully in this film the action is played for laughs and boy are they funny, the whole theater was laughing at the scene where McClane outsmarts a jet as half the city is destroyed around him and no one including McClane gets a scratch on them. I like the fact that my kids can see a movie and see that it's completely safe to fall out of an exploding helicopter, because I'm sure if anyone of us were faced with that same situation we too could stand up and brush the debris off of us and keep on trucking.                 The film came along to a climax that left me satisfied, I have to thank the Brilliant Len Wiseman again because finally for the first time in four films the horrible 'Yippie-Ki-Ay' line was rightfully censored and my kids couldn'thave been happier (well actually they were asleep by that time in the movie but I told them about it when they woke up and they seemed to be pleased). Unfortunately some of the villains did die by the end of the film and as much as I'd rather see them be arrested I'm sure The genius Len Wiseman will add scenes of McClane feeling remorse and wishing he could've avoided the loss of life as well as a proper burial for the villains into the DVD. Overall the film is a must see for the whole family as the series should have been all along, Bring your kids, bring your Grandma, Bring your Catholic Priest, all walks of life will enjoy Live Free or Die Hard (of natural causes).    P.S. I just heard the great news that The Genius Len Wiseman is going to be remaking John Carpenter's 'Escape From New York' I hope he does the same for that film and takes out all the unnecessary violence, swearwords , controversial ideas and any intensity what so ever because me and my kids are running out of movies to see.
B000003TAL|5.0|I'll admit that when I first listened to Daydream Nation, I wasn't so sure I liked it. It was lengthy, almost self-consciously difficult, dissonant, and strange. The second time through, I latched onto a few songs (\\"Teen Age Riot,\\" \\"Candle,\\" \\"Silver Rocket,\\" \\"Total Trash\\"). The third time through, however, I was completely hooked. Daydream Nation is an undeniable post-punk masterpiece, endlessly inventive and exciting. Melodies float in and out of the distorted guitar haze, songs are interrupted by feedback, noise, and lengthy, hypnotic instrumental passages. And somehow, it is still fairly accessible (that is, if you're okay with unconventional song structures, strange guitar tunings, and sheer noise). Admittedly, Sonic Youth is not for everyone, but if you can get in there, it's really great stuff. Highly, highly recommended.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I saw Grindhouse at the Drive-In, I bought 2 Grindhouse t-shirts and the Grindhouse hardcover coffeetable making-of book.  I worship this flick but I refuse to knuckle under to the Weinstein's to buying these \\"movies\\" in seperate installments.  IT'S ONE MOVIE!!!  Has there ever been a dvd that's totally ruined what the concept of what the movie was about when it was released?  There is now. It really was a great experience to see this movie for what it was: A Double Feature!  It figures that Hollywood would take a film with a cool concept and twist it around just to make more money because people didn't get it.  I guess it didn't help that they released it on Easter weekend.  GRINDHOUSE for Easter!  Also, the entire east coast got hammered by a massive blizzard that very weekend it was released.       I can't say not to buy these movies seperately because they are too cool to miss.  Personally, I'll wait till the theatrical version is released ( with all the faux trailers.  Something you won't get in the seperate releases), then I'll get the 2 other ones; the way it's suppose to happen, not the other way around.  Good luck getting people to buy the theatrical release after they spent over $60 for the other 2.       Thanks for ruining a cool concept, Weinstein brothers.  May your fortune suffer for it!  You won't get my money any more because I'm on the hunt for Bootlegs.     Dean, Cleveland, Ohio.

B000I5Y9G8|3.0|Well add another half star at least, especially if you're a long date fan - cause  despite of being aligned to the last VDGG album entitled \\"The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome - you can find some remarkable introspective and sad songs inside the present work dated 1977. Think for example of the emotional tunes like \\"Looking Glass\\" or \\"Betrayed\\", this latter enriched by means of a great vocal performance by Peter or of other interesting tracks such as the desperate \\"On Tuesdays...\\" and once again the progressive oriented tune entitled \\"Lost And Found\\" (Peter never forget his roots!!).    Of course I prefer the music of Hammil with VDGG, like for instance within the excellent \\"Pawn Hearts\\", but the songs mentioned above are anyway respectable. Instead \\"Autumn\\" is easier but  in the mood of the next solo albums by Peter, characterized by his piano and the violin as well, a kind of ballad ...then you can listen to \\"Yoga\\" with its \\"simil-crimson\\" structure (a sort of art rock style), which is not bad as well as the plot of the whole album, in general regarding life with its dramatic vicissitudes.    Besides the bonus tracks - as an extract from a John Peel radio show - are not so useful neither better than their original studio version, but however the output is remarkable and the songs well structured anyway.    Make your own choice, but if you're a long date fan you can't miss it!

B000LAZDQA|5.0|I'd heard of Shortbus through several gay media outlets, and the reviews were varied but generally positive.  Having seen it now, I was captivated.  There were a few moments that were a bit hard to swallow, but what really held me were the other moments--  looks between characters:  James and Jamie during the blackout,  Sophie and Severin in the lesbian room, Sophie and the tattood lady in the Sex-Not-Bombs room, Sophie and the viewer the moment she 'causes' (and the moment she 'ends') the blackout, they all pull you so deeply into the moment the characters are experiencing.  And the entire musical part at the end caused such an upswell of happiness.  Certainly not for the squeamish or the purit(yr)annical, but for everyone else I'd encourage seeing it.

0812548094|5.0|By now you've seen reviews of this book that hype it as the best thing ever, and those that slam it for the violence and rape images. I will do neither. I give it 5 stars based on one thing: its ability to keep me turning page after page, not wanting to put the book down. The only other book in this series that accomplishes that feat for me is Faith of the Fallen. Some reviewers claim they know Fantasy. I know Fantasy Fiction myself...my library contains over 500 books in the genre, and I am a writer myself, though I have not yet sought to publish my work.    Yes, there are acts of violence and rape described in this book. It's probably overdone to drive home just how evil the enemy is, so that Richard's actions are all the more justified. Unnecessary, yes. But ultimately it has a place in my library. You see, if every book on my shelf were The Sword of Shannara, that would be incredibly boring. No knock aginst Terry Brooks, I enjoy his books and am just using this as an example. It is the diversity of the material that makes the reading worthwhile. There is nothing out there like The Sword of Truth series. Though people will claim the Sword of Truth is similar to the Wheel of Time series, the latter has child-like characters, way too many side stories and characters, does not possess the violence and graphic descriptions, and the villians are forgettable. So Goodkind sits on my shelf next to Zelazny's Amber, Moorcock's Elric, Brooks's Shannara, Hobb's Assassin, and many others...and holds its own place for what it brings to the table.    For those who choose to explore it, this book holds some fascinating elements such as the Sliph, the Mriswrath Cape, the Black and White Towers, how prophecy works and much more. No other book in the series brings out such a variety of fantastic elements.    My final thought on the entire series is that it was intended as two trilogies, with Wizard's First Rule through Blood of the Fold as the first, and the Chainfire trilogy as the second. But perhaps after the success of the first two books, someone in Goodkind's camp looked over at the bloated garbage Jordan was writing (and the money he was making) and said, \\"hey, we can do that too!\\" Every book in between the \\"two trilogies\\" I have described above does little to advance the overall plot, which explains why they are the least popular. Although, without the bloating, we would never have been gifted with the excellent Faith of the Fallen. But that is a story (or should I say review) for another day...
B000I0QKDS|4.0|The sound is far better than the previous Epic cd issue(although there is still a bit of crackliness on 'Ol' Man River')and it's great to have all the 45 single tracks on here as well. Too bad there wasn't any room for any 1967-8 BBC tracks.
B00000JRTX|4.0|Charles (Hugh Grant) is what some people would call a player.  He has had numerous relationships, but commitment is not in his vocabulary.  Charles's fear of commitment suffers a challenge when he meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell).  Carrie is intelligent, mysterious and honest, and is very self-confident and care-free.  Charles struggles against his feelings as he finds himself falling in love with Carrie, but not wanting to speak those words aloud.<br /><br />This movie is humorous from beginning to end.  Sometimes the humor is worthy of a laugh, but much of the humor just made me smile.  Regardless of whether I was smiling or laughing, I was completely involved in the story and I wanted Charles and Carrie to end up with each other.  There are four weddings, and a sad funeral, but each wedding and the funeral provide opportunities for an array of jokes and gags.<br /><br />I only have one complaint about this movie.  There is significant use of four-letter words throughout.  Unfortunately, one portion of the movie benefits from the language so eliminating it would also eliminate some of the humor, but there are places where the language was unnecessary.  Obviously this movie is more suitable for an older audience.  I would probably avoid showing the DVD version to anyone younger than 16 or 17 years old because of the language.<br /><br />I have seen comments about Hugh Grant and his \\"mumbling.\\"  I guess I have a different definition of mumbling.  I thought Grant spoke his lines about as clearly as I talk (maybe I mumble), and other than brief moments where he was being introspective - let's face it, people may mumble when they are thinking out loud - Grant does not mumble.<br /><br />I am also impressed that Hugh Grant somehow said four-letter words and left a string of girl friends behind him, and yet he still looked sweet and innocent.  I guess that was why he was able to get another girl friend each time he dumped the last one.<br /><br />Andie MacDowell is beautiful and expressive and perfect for this role.  She is sexy and mysterious and intelligent and sensitive, sometimes all at once.  I could readily see why Charles was smitten by Carrie.  As with most characters Andie MacDowell plays, she brings elegant and classy Carrie to life.<br /><br />This movie was good enough to gain two Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture and Best Screenplay.  Beyond those nominations, the movie won 23 significant awards, such as the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Picture in 1994.  The movie was nominated for another 14 awards of varying stature.<br /><br />\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" is a rare light romantic comedy that relies on an unusual combination of subtle and blatant humor in combination with an intelligent plot.  I wondered whether Charles had a hope of capturing the heart of beautiful Carrie to the end of the movie, even as I was smiling and laughing at the humor.  If you enjoy light romantic comedies, Hugh Grant or Andie MacDowell, you will find this award-winning movie to be worth more than one watch.<br /><br />Enjoy!ole.

B000NVIXFK|1.0|I love Rush.  Not just the 70's period of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight,\\" but all Rush.  My favorite era is probably 80's and 90's, when the band was really mixing strong melodies with mature emotional content.      I have no idea what this is all about.  There's no connection anymore.  There's no real soul to this disc.  I feel like I'm listening to a group of people trying hard to sound relevent.  It's heartbreaking.  After all Neil Peart's introspective (and somewhat pretentious) literary outings, I expected the music of Rush to grow.  To reach new vistas.  I hate to say it but I think the guys are just out of ideas.  It certainly seems that way here.  This is the first Rush disc I've bought that I just can't listen to.  There's just nothing here.  Sorry, guys.
B000ROALE4|5.0|A previous reviewer stated that every album after Seasons was pure crap, not true. There are some very good songs on those albums, however, something was missing. In the ten plus years since Seasons, Slayer has seen a few changes, new drummer, new tunings, grey hair and beer guts, and Kerry King has no hair. Most notably different has been the feel of the songs. Granted Slayer can deal out the thrash better than anyone, especially Metallica, who long ago sold their souls for money and profit. Slayer has never strayed from their hearts, granted Kerry King may have laid off of attacking Christianity for a while, but they never abandoned themselves or their fans.<br /> This new album finds Slayer once again in top form. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are hell bent on shredding your ears. Tom Araya's vocals are as angry as ever, and best of all we have Dave Lombardo back to pound your brain into oblivion with his awesome double bass. I also cheer Kerry King's triumphant return to what he does best, mocking the hell out of the Christian religion, which is as he says \\"I like to take pot shots at religion because it's the most brain washing thing that is totally acceptable in America and probably most every place else in the world. I think it's a load of [...].<br /> For those who are new to Slayer and liked this album, I would also recommend Seasons in the Abyss, and South of Heaven, those two are very good introductions into the heavier earlier stuff, Rain in Blood, Hell Awaits, and Show no Mercy.
B00007BK2N|5.0|First off R.I.P. Tony Wilson (he died 8-11-07)... I just can not put into words how great this movie is. The dark portrayal of Ian Curtis (look out for 'Closer' a movie about him in the US Oct 10-07) to the goofy druggers Happy Mondays, this is like 2 movies for the price of one. My favorite scene maybe in cinema history is when the actor Wilson is narrating a scene that we are watching of Vini Reilly (Duruti Column) walking out of a storage room . A non-sensible unrelating 'cameo' to the movie's plot at first, but the narrator actor Wilson says this scene didn't make the final cut!!!?? HA! Brilliant, sorry but it did make the final cut because it was just shown.  I recommend watching this with the actual Tony Wilson commentary on, wow the loads of info that pours through thy speakers.. Beyond five stars and thanks to the real Tony Wilson for enriching my life with art and music both sincere and beautiful. And thanks to the makers of this movie for explaining to me the man behind my fond memories growing up on Factory music. I just saw the art and heard the music now years later I see the story
1594489505|5.0|The Kite Runner being one of those rare books that I had an almost physical connection with, I was very much looking forward to A Thousand Splendid Suns.<br /><br />Having just finished it a few days ago, I am not sure I liked it as much as Hosseini's first one. This is NOT to say that it was a bad book or weaker than its predecessor (after all I am still giving it 5 stars). It just was - for me - that much harder to read. I felt the desperation and utter hopelessness of Mariam, her mother, and Laila to the point where I had to put down the book several times, unable to go on reading until I had calmed down. It gripped me, like the Kite Runner did, from the first to the very last page but it also hurt more emotionally.<br /><br />Whether this was because it is a book about women and therefore touched me more, or whether it was because page after page the lives of Mariam and Laila felt like a never-ending & ever-more desperate nightmare, I don't know. In more ways than one it reminded me of the Oscar-nominated movie [[ASIN:B0001IXTDG Osama]].<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns is, like the Kite Runner, a book about human despair and guilt but also about courage, incredible tenderness and ultimately about redemption. There is hope offered at the end of the book - thank you, Mr. Hosseini - but it is not a feel-good Hollywood-type ending with all protagonists safe and sound. It is a more frail kind of hope, one that the reader senses may be crushed at any second.<br /><br />The best way to describe it is: It is a true tour de force and can leave you drained and aching for a more just, more peaceful and simpler world. Not a beach read but a novel that will stay with the reader long after it was finished.
B00005JPLW|1.0|I knew this would not be as good as all the reviews where saying, but I thought it would at least be OK. This movie sucks. First of all the first hour is setting you up for the second hour of fighting. This movie is not non-stop action that others would let you believe. I really like Sin City. There is no comparision of the two movies. Sin City is a much superior product. I am so happy I rented 300 first. There is know way I would buy this gargage. I am an action movie fan, go watch the Road Warrior or Total Recall if you want realistic action.
B000J103OI|5.0|Having worked for high-level executives in corporate and military careers as a young man, I can vouch for the authenticity of what's taught in The Devil Wears Prada.  Meryl Streep's portrayal of a person with immense responsibility is right on target.  That is, the moral of the story can take on different dimensions.  As a young person, the school of hard knocks often makes clear the path towards the future.  It's like a prism - only you can decide which side to see it from.
B00006I53S|3.0|I just got the lens this afternoon from Amazon. I'm generally happy as it was way better than the stock lens that Canon included with my Rebel XT.<br /><br />I tried a couple of shots. And the verdict? I wasn't really impressed. Don't get me wrong, it's a fairly decent lens, the range is wide enough that it can cater to most of any photobugs general shooting needs.<br /><br />But the reason I wasn't really impressed was because prior to this purchase, the lens I used a lot was the Canon EF 50mm F/1.4<br /><br />I know I shouldn't compare apples and oranges but deep down I was. I wanted this lens to try to be at par with my fixed focal specially with the IS and all. Plus, I remembered all the optimistic reviews I read here at Amazon. But alas, I was wrong. I should have listened to my gutt's gutt feel.<br /><br />Anyhow you get what you pay for. I mean for a measly $370 you get a decent range coupled with some nifty features such as IS and USM, you simply can't beat that. And then again, it's way better than the stock lens (Canon EFS 18-55mm F/3.5 - 5.6 plastic lens)<br /><br />Lastly, if you own a fixed focal and love the crisp images, think hard before you consider this lens. If you can shell out an extra $800 or so then buy either the Canon EF 24-70mm F/2.8 L or Canon EF 24-105mm F/4 L lenses instead. Both are far superior to this lens and are well worth the investment.<br /><br />But if you are poor like me then I guess we have to live within our means.
0823013626|5.0|Donna Kato has done it again!  Her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay, published in 1997, is still a valuable source of information but now  she has written another that is also a beautiful, informative, visual gem.  This one is full of surface effects including methods of transfers for toner and inkjet prints, stamps, stencils, inks and paints, liquid clays and more.  Each technique has a step by step tutorial with clear photographs and text. The finished pieces are all enhanced by outstanding design as well as craftsmanship.  A great book by a truly talented artist.  It has been well worth the wait.    Carol Blackburn author of 'Making Polymer Clay Beads'
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins, the world famous Oxford evolutionary biologist, author, public speaker and atheist takes on religion in this tour de force.  If you have an interest in the current popular atheist type books, this book is a must read.<br /><br />I would say that Dawkins perspective in this book and others are the scientific/evolutionary side of similar arguments made by Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris or Christopher Hitchins.<br /><br />Personally I really enjoyed reading this book; I thought it was entertaining, informative, funny at times and very well written.  However, please keep in mind when you read this book that it is not a work of philosophy or theology, it really is a perspective book about the existence of God and value of religion.  It represents an atheists perspective on the value of religion in society, how can it not been entertaining.  Considering the author and the subject matter some may find this book incredibly provocative.<br /><br />Many readers who claim to be \\"faith-heads\\" (to borrow a term from Dawkins) may find this book insulting and preposterous.  Contrary to what many reviewers have written, personally I did not find anything about the text very hateful.  Essentially I would say that many of the arguments Dawkins makes are the basic humanist arguments that have been around since the enlightenment; Dawkins revitalizes these arguments by introducing a different, modern perspective and his own insightful opinions.  At times he gets carried away in his own rhetoric but by and large this problem is small when compared with his compelling take on this very interesting subject matter.<br /><br />Another issue I felt in reading the book is Dawkins refutes the teachings of the Bible based on the assumption of literal interpretation.  Anybody who has grown up as a church goer or taken theology classes knows his interpretations could be understood as \\"theologically\\" incorrect or subject to criticism.  However, from the perspective of this book I would say his points are still extremely valid since it is the literalist interpretation of scripture he is attacking.<br /><br />Dawkins use of historical references and quotes are appropriate and interesting.  Probably one of the most poignant arguments is the near the end of the book where he discusses the evolutionary origins of morality, effectively refuting the assertion that without God there can be no morality.  Also worth mentioning is his well developed argument for the literary value of the Bible and other religious books.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you already have come to a solid personal conclusion about the existence of God I do not think this book is going to convince you.  \\"Faith\\" is a very hard thing to shake in a trully convicted individual.<br /><br />If you agree with Dawkins that God does not exist then you may like this book, you may find it reinforces your world view.<br /><br />If you have unquestioned faith in the existence of God(s) or a lifetime commitment to your faith you may hate this book.<br /><br />Either way, agree with him or not, I think this is a interesting perspective on an interesting subject.  I also highly suggest the Selfish Gene by Dawkins.extremely valid since it is the literalist interpretation of scripture he is attacking.

1594489505|3.0|This review was written in two parts. The first, after I put down the book half way. It was boring, and the stack of more promising books was calling me to focus on quality, not popularity.<br /><br />\\"Is this the same author who has so brilliantly depicted the two main characters in The Kite Runner?\\" I asked in the review, \\"Or is it true that most male writers cannot write female protagonists?\\"<br /><br />An accomplished writer, Hosseini needed not convince me that he could string sentences one by one. It was the whole that now counted. In \\"1000 Suns,\\" the female characters came through as shallow and stereotypical. Only the setting was interesting, but even this foreign land lacked the subtle nuances I had found in Hosseini's previous work.<br /><br />Mostly, there was not much of a story development. There weren't enough seeds within the characters to foreshadow future actions that came from within them.<br /><br />Rating for Part I: 2 stars.<br /><br />Part II:<br /><br />After prodding from a friend, I agreed to read on and to move \\"to the interesting part,\\" for the first part, she said, was \\"only a preparation for the story\\" (A sin no writer should commit.)<br /><br />Sure enough, the second part turned out to be quite wonderful. Against the backdrop of war in Afghanistan, the plot unfolds along with the growing friendship between two unlikely women united against a common enemy. As such, the story is filled with movement, plot, and emotions.<br /><br />The characters, though, remain problematic, as some of their personality traits are simply inconsistent. And more so in the wrap-up of the novel with a stacked epilogue-like summary, where the two protagonists are supposedly elevated to new heights. Except that the author had failed to establish the necessary characteristics in each to warrant such adulation.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book left me a lot more satisfied than I had expected givn its feeble start. I will recommend it to those whose bookshelves are empty, but not to those immersed in really good books.<br /><br />Rating for part II: 4 stars. Average for the book--3 stars.<br /><br />Talia Carner, author,<br />[[ASIN:1930252986 Puppet Child]] and  [[ASIN:0977382125 China Doll]]g for part II: 4 stars. Average for the book--3 stars.

B0002E5O9G|5.0|so one day i'm puttering around amazon since im bored and it's prolly about 3 in the morning. i randomly type in lea salonga and up pops this recording of Les Miserables. i had just purchased miss saigon and thought, hmm well that's cool. i started looking at this recording and saw that lea salonga and michael ball were both here. i loved them both in miss saigon and aspects of love respectively. when i saw that judy kuhn was also here i couldn't press \\"add to cart\\" fast enough.    to title this as the dream cast is a prtty lofty status. but this recording lives up brilliantly. this cast is well, a dream cast. this is the only recording of les mis that i own or have ever heard. i don't feel there's any point in looking for any other. with most musicals i usually buy a couple of cast recordings, but this one is spectacular.    the music is rich and brilliant. the royal philharmonic orchestra sounds rich and vibrant. the recurring themes throughout the musical are all beautiful and moving. the more rousing numbers such as \\"one day more\\" and \\"do you hear the people sing\\" are both great too. the characters are all rich and vibrant. as a listener you can feel for them in a way that is pretty impressive for a recording.    and then there's that dream cast. there trully is no other way to catagorize them. they ALL bring emotion to their songs and make for a moving musical.    COLM WILKINSON - wilkinson's version of valjean is so impressive. he adds layers and emotion and his voice sounds weathered and full of the pain of years in prison. his pivitol performance really sets the bar for the rest of the cast. when he really belts in towards the end of valjean's soliloquy, its hard not to get goosebumps.    PHILIP QUAST - phillip quast as javert is also impressive. his ability to play the cold persuer of javier at first is great, but his emotional delivery in the second act shows great range and ability    MICHAEL BALL - i love michael ball's voice anyways but his versiion ofmarius is great. his performance is moving like all of his. \\"empty chairs at empty tables\\" is particularly moving. and when he and lea salonga perform on \\"a little fall of rain\\" it's pretty hard to keep a dry eye.    LEA SALONGA - lea salonga is my all-time favorite vocalist. the beauty and emotion of her voice is astounding. she's the reason why i bought this cd and she is stunning here. some have complained that her injection of bitterness in \\"on my own\\" is a poor delivery. i couldn't disagree more. her ability to infuse the hope that marius will love her and the bitter realization that he never will makes \\"on my own\\" a brilliant anthem of unrequieted love that only those who know it can understand. when she delivers \\"a little fall of rain\\" the irony that she finally gets what she has yearned for is moving to the point of tears.    the rest of the cast shines as well. some have complained about judy kuhn, but i love her voice as well and her interpretation of cosette is great. ruthie henshall as fantine is stunning. \\"i dreamed a dream\\" is beautiful and her emotion is second only to salonga. alun armstrong and jenny galloway are both hilareous and come close to stealing the show.    overall, this is a beautiful version of a brilliant show. and is the only one that i need to appreciate the endearing greatness of this show. the cast all shines. there is no weak link. everyone dazzles no matter how small their part is. this is an absolute MUST own for any musical fan at all. you won't regret it
B000R9J3X4|5.0|Well! What a delight to have this great collection of garbage gold! The band has never failed to have its own niche which is very difficult to classify, between rock/pop/alternative....etc.<br />The one thing for sure is that garbage have stood the test of time. The ability to combine these very dark-at most times-lyrics with such beatifully layered and rich melodies is hard to come by!<br /><br />Shirley Manson is a cut above the rest and I don't know if we can compare her to anybody else. Such a deep voice that is very cold that it penetrates your bones but at the same time as warm as one can immagine, the kind of warmth that makes you feel,....Oh, I'm not the only one that feels this way and thinks this way, ....she does too!<br /><br />This album spans most of their albums with emphasis on ones over others but I think that collectively it is a true representation of Garbage's rich harvest.<br /><br />I won't go over every song on the album but I can say that I listen to the whole album and probably skip one or two tracks at most and that's not because they're not good tracks but because I have O.D'd on them previously.<br /> I disagree with some of the reviews that say that the album loses weight in the middle and actually my favourite part of the album is the second part where more melodic meets gothic shirley takes place.<br /><br />Some stand out tracks:<br />\\"tell me where it hurts\\" their new single, what a beautiful piece of work complete with strings and grand arrangements and tender lyrics, one of my favourites.<br /><br />\\"It's all over but the crying\\", how true! anyone who has not said this sentence to themselves at least once in a lifetime is kidding themselves. Beautiful music and rich arrangements, still brings tears to my eyes, especially at the end with ther confronting phrase: \\"baby, we're done\\"<br /><br />\\"the world is not enough\\" probably one of the best 007 anthems, you can see why garbage were chosen for this song, especially Shirley Manson's captivating voice and what a grand statement \\"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, BUT IT IS SUCH A PERFECT PLACE TO START!\\" Such a regal piece of art! One of my all time favourites.<br /><br />\\"You look so fine\\" probably the softest song they have done, once again, beautiful arrangemnets and shirley does it again.<br /><br />\\"Special\\" one of my favourites,...do you have an opinion, a mind of your own, I thought you were special, I thought you should know!<br /><br />\\"Queer\\" the essence of garbage who never take themselves seriously but are serious deep down inside about the staements they make!<br /><br />\\"Cherry lips\\" what a querky piece of music and yes...\\"Go baby Go Go, we're right behind you, Go baby Go Go!!\\" how more uplifting can you get!<br /><br /> All the other songs are very well produced but I won't review all of them. A last remark about the album is that the production is slik and clean. I think the best thing to do to get the most joy out of this album and truely appreciate Shirley Manson's voice is to turn the lights right dowm and pump the volume up and close your eyes and let the music and Shirley's voice take on a beautiful magical juorney.......Such a perfect place to start!  To Shirley and Garbage:  Love and respect  xxOT ENOUGH, BUT IT IS SUCH A PERFECT PLACE TO START!\\" Such a regal piece of art!

B000065BPB|4.0|These are nice headphones with no nasty behavior.  They really make your ears heat up, so I'd recommend them for when you're really trying to cut out external noise (which is exactly what I use them for).  For general listening, I'd pick an open headphone that lets a little air in.
B000002BYD|4.0|While \\"No Code\\" was a great album in it's own way, it was a far cry from the energetic tunes on \\"Vitalogy\\", the bands third album. \\"Yield\\" seems like it could be part 2 of \\"Vitalogy\\". Lots of song variety, heavy songs, fast songs, mellow ballads and what you would have expected from Pearl Jam following their first three hit records. \\"Given to Fly\\" was a mellow hit single, \\"Do the Evolution\\" was a heavy rocker that was also a single, and was also the first music video they made since \\"Jeremy\\", I believe. It was a long time, I know that. \\"Faithful\\", \\"Wishlist\\", \\"No Way\\", \\"In Hiding\\", and \\"Pilate\\" are all highlights.  I enjoyed this record almost as much as their earlier stuff, and it boasts some of the best songwriting of their careers. If you like \\"Vitalogy\\", this is probably as close as you can get to that out of their newer stuff. This album is already 9 years old, but as with all PJ, it ages extremely well.

This is a must see for all who would like to get a taste of the beginning of the industrial revolution and fascinated with experiencing a 19th Century life in England; it's Pride & Prejudice, but through the eyes of middle and lower class society!
B00005MP58|5.0|I have seen the \\"movie\\" version of Pride and Predjudice and read the book but nothing compares to this production - It is wonderful.  There are two discs and the running time is long so you may want to watch Part I and Part II on different days.    You will love this version...It is one of my all time favorites!
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I love Joshua Radin. He is amazing and such a wonderful and yet simple song writer. This is a wonderful CD I highly recommend it.
B000QXDEDG|3.0|Honestly this movie was not my cup of tea, but that is just a personal opinion, there is alot of blood and gore but if that is what you're looking for this is definitely the movie for you. I am buying this today for my fiance who loved the movie, so I think it must be a guy thing.  With that said, I will say that it was beautifully made, the effects are breath-taking, and when I wasn't squirming in my seat at the theater I was in amazement about how good the computer work was on this.    All in all, it is definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you are looking for a good guy flick with alot of blood (and I mean alot) this is the movie for you.
B000P0I4O4|3.0|Cusack, who is usually a nice guy, but sometimes also funny, for which he gets no chance here, goes on a bonding excursion with his teenage son, and comes back with a new girl friend and a new pal in the underworld.<br />The movie has all the ingredients for a speedy action thriller, and just how it fails to raise even the tiniest bit of suspense still is not clear to me. It is also not funny, except when the backwoods cop spills the coffee on the DC smartarse's shirt. That is hilarious.<br />Morgan Freeman does his best to assure everybody that we should not mistake him for a nice guy. Oddly, he fails, and ends up beloved by the audience. We even seem to want him to do his job. After all he wants to put in a solid day's job for his considerable pay.
1401211909|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  I give Gaiman props for originality and great technical writing, but other than that the book I felt was just eh.  The book was bloody but never exciting, I never truly felt that any of the main characters lives were in danger.  The end for anyone with a keen eye was incredibly predictable and incredibly anti-climactic.  Maybe they'll do a better job with the movie.

B00005U8EM|5.0|Groundhog Day is based on what may be the oddest premise for a romantic comedy ever.  A TV news weatherman (Bill Murray) goes to Punxatawnee, PA to cover Groundhog Day.  The next day he wakes up and it is Groundhog Day again.  No one remembers that this day has already passed and so he is forced to live it again.  And the next day he wakes up and... it's Groundhog Day again.  And again... and again... and again... and, well, you get the idea.  Watching Murray's character go through this bizarre situation and the effect it has on him is absolutely riveting.  I love that no attempt to explain this time-loop is ever made, it's enough for the viewer to know that it is happening and we don't need to get bogged down in some geeky sci fi explanation.    Bill Murray has a tendency to be a little too smug and over-the-top in his movie performances but he is at the top of his game here.  His timing is perfect and the role harnesses his smug and biting humor but this is tempered as the story progresses and Murray captures the nuances perfectly.  The rest of the cast similarly rises to the level of the unusually intelligent script.  For my money, this is probably the single best movie in the \\"romantic comedy\\" genre.  It is unique and perfectly executed.  Well worth watching whether you are a fan of Bill Murray or not.
B000003TAR|4.0|This CD is raw, emotionally and musically.  It puts the listener in a challenging place of feeling sympathy for the speaker, yet at times being appalled at his bleakness.  That complexity combines with a really hard rock sound to create something moving.  This is the emotion and sound grunge became known for.
0307346609|5.0|DO WHAT EVER YOU HAVE TO DO TO READ THIS BOOK.  Buy it, borrow it, whatever.  This is probably one of the best books I have ever read, and the only reason it won't get the credit it is due is because it just so happen to be about zombies...Scratch that forget that I even said that because I don't want you to not read this because you think this is some kind of pulpy zombie-horror novel, or an Anne Rice knock off that is riddled with the notions of an underground society of the living dead.  Don't read any of the other reviews, don't read the dust jacket, don't read anything else about this book but this book.<br /><br />I know that already some of you might be thinking, \\"Zombies, really...Zombies.\\"  Stop.  This book is about people, this book is about survival, this book is about compassion.  The zombies are probably the most downplayed element of the story, simply the kick that gets the ball rolling.  If it makes it easier to you simply replace the idea of zombies with the idea of a plague that is threatening humanity.  The true focus of this book is the first-hand account of the people that had to deal with that plague.<br /><br />This is where the book reaches the upper echelon of my opinion.  Brooks does such a great job of writing from the perspective of so many different types of people that you begin to buy into them.  You feel connected to these people.  You laugh when they do; cry when they do, and you listen to their stories with a fervor that could rival a Jack Russell on speed.  This is a great book about a fake war on a global scale, told first hand by the survivors.  A great book that reminds you what it is to be human, and how that is a good thing...<br /><br />--palmer©
B00005JPLW|4.0|Okay, I am not going to waste your time with paragraphs full of mindless blather.  This isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it is quite captivating.  The cinematography and stylized coloring set this movie apart from your average epic action movies.<br /><br />Overall, the style of the movie is groundbreaking.  I do believe that in 5-10 years we will look back at this film and view it like we look at the Matrix.  This style will be copied for years to come.<br /><br />If you liked the way Sin City was filmed, you will like this film.  If you like Gladiator or Braveheart you will also like this film.  It is worth the rental and the purchase of the DVD.
B000QQFKYE|2.0|I have been a David Lynch fan for many years, but having seen this film knowing nothing about it beforehand, except the fact that Lynch wrote and directed it, I can understand why he named the company responsible for its production \\"Absurda.\\" The film certainly has some memorable (and sinister) scenes, but taken as a whole, it appears to be an example of theater of the absurd with elements of Grand Guignol. Some reviewers seem to have embraced an emperor's new clothes perspective in their comments, which may amuse Mr. Lynch if he ever reads them.<br /><br />By the way, William H. Macy appears briefly (although uncredited) as a TV announcer.<br /><br />One of the noteworthy extras on the second disk  is a short film of Lynch cooking quinoa with broccoli, and telling a strange - and absurd - story about traveling by train from Greece through Yugoslavia to Venice.<br /><br />I would advise potential viewers to rent this film (preferably from a library) before investing money to buy it.
0887308589|4.0|Yeah, we all know Dilbert.  Meetings are waste of time, managers are stupid, and co-workers are imbeciles.  I half expected this book to be full of these cliches.  Not even close.  Scott Adams does an excellent job of showing the humor of a job with smart observances and clever ideas.  From the absurd yet funny comics, to actual written letters from organizations, and his own personal experiences - Adams gives out humor that is relevant, funny, and pertinent.  His topics range from management, to consultants, to engineers, to marketing, and much more.  He touches on all facets of the workplace in a manner that couldn't be handled well in a few comic strips.    I'm working and getting my MBA now, and this sort of book tends to ground me.  It's a quick and easy read.  Nothing special, but very smart and funny.
B000P0J024|4.0|The Wilburys are a great band and it's great to have them back, reissued on CD.  I think Vol 1 is strongest of the 2 disks, mainly because the additional magic of Roy Orbison is (unavoidably) missing from the second disk a.k.a. Vol 3.  Extra tracks almost make up for Roy's absence.  The DVD is also a kick - especially the Wilbury Twist.  My actual rating is 4.5 stars.   God Bless both Roy and George.
B000001FI7|5.0|I love this CD.  It has such slight presence but its power is unmistakable. The vocals are haunting, the music infinitely ambient.  Portishead has the kind of elusive sound that you don't realize is being written in until you find yourself singing it later.  Somehow Portishead was a wonderfully kept secret.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|Firefly was an amazing show. I never saw it as it aired, I saw it once it was released to DVD. When people would try to describe it to me to get me to watch it, they would always call it a sci-fi western or a comedy sci-fi western. That just didn't sound like anything worth watching. It took them a long time to get me to watch the show, but when I did I couldn't believe how much fun it was. I have since got my parents and my siblings hooked on this show, it just appeals to everyone. The movie, while very very fun and well worth watching, doesn't answer all the questions you'd expect it to, so don't expect complete closure.[[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000Q9IZ5C Serenity (Collector's Edition)]] And it will help a lot to those new to Firefly to go back and watch the series before the film,[[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]]. But being able to watch this awesome cast for 2 more hours of fun was wonderful. The biggest letdown was undeniably the completely unresolved issue of Book's storyline. The fact that they didn't even attempt to explain his past upset us all. But all in all, this is a must own as a fair ending to a great series, and not very many shows can say they at least got a chance to give any sort of ending or resolve to it.
1594481717|5.0|What I love is when a book isn't just conceptual; it's practical.  A Whole New Mind fits that bill nicely.    Dan Pink does a great job of not only laying out the essential principles to a well-rounded, complete way to bring your best to work, but he also gives excellent examples and resources to learn from and develop your capabilities.    Well researched, a great read, entertaining, and immensely useful.  I highly recommend it.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|I heard a lot of good things about singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile for a few years now; still, I never got around to picking up her self-titled debut album. I did, however, get my hands on her sophomore album The Story, and I'm having a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />It would be too easy to say that Brandi is channeling Melissa Etheridge because both women are lesbians, play acoustic guitar and have edgy vocals. Whatever the case, Brandi has some great stuff to say. Highlights include \\"Losing Heart\\", \\"Again Today\\" (as well as the hidden track that follows, \\"Hiding My Heart\\") and the epic \\"Josephine\\". But my favorite is the album's opener, \\"Late Morning Lullaby\\".<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off half a star is because as much as I enjoy Brandi's in-your-face vocals, she still goes a little overboard toward the end of the title track. But The Story is still a highly recommended album for listening pleasure. Pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000NA28A2|4.0|4 1/2*    Good Latin albums are getting harder and harder to find these days - the glory days of salsa and merengue(the 90s and early 00's) are over, and even great artists like Olga Tanon and Manney Manuel are having a hard time coming up with good material.    Some exceptions include Milly Quezada and Gilberto Santa Rosa, and it is great to see Juan Luis Guerra doing the same.    Guerra is  one of the greatest Latin musicians working  today: he writes, arranges and sings all his songs. His past work is legendary, and are among the greatest ever written, even if I personally have to endure the political angle of some of his lyrics.    Recently Mr. Guerra took a very unfortunate turn towards \\"Christian merengue\\" which I found objectionable and of lower musical quality moreover.     Mercifully, this new album is just love songs, free of politics and religion (as far as I can tell - I am not a fluent Spanish speaker) - and it is a real winner. While it may not quite have the unique rustic  charm of his greatest work, it is, on the hand, more modern and accessible, his technical singing abilities have matured magnificently, plus the recording quality of this CD is a big improvement over his earlier ones.      The first half of the album includes an infectious mambo, an abolutely magnificent bachata, Qaue Me Des Tu Carino,  and the kind of high spirited salsa and merengue we associate with this artist. It is similar to his old work, but different.     The second half of the album is perhaps a bit less impressive. The best here is an intriguing mellow salsa Cancioncita De Amor, and a ballad Sabia Manera in which Guerra sings more beautifully than I have ever heard him. On the basis of this one song alone, I would say Guerra has the finest male voice in Latin music today.     The other songs in the second half are fine, but relatively conventional compared to the rest of the album. Plus the title tune, La Llave de mi Corazon is a straight repeat of Medicine for My Soul, but in Spanish. The Final \\"bonus\\" song A La Vera is beautiful, but abbreviated.     I would not say La Llave de mi Corazon surpasses Guerra's best work of the 80s and the 90s , but that is really not important. It is good to see that Mr. Guerra has come up with an album  that retains much of what has made him so great, but without repeating himself.     With all the dreary music being released today, that La Llave de Mi Corazon should get a \\"Best Album\\" award is a no-brainer.
B00005JODK|5.0|Some of the negative reviewers who are revolted by Travolta's fat-suit and the seriousness of segregation during the 60s, among other things - these people need to lighten up. 'Hairspray', like 'Grease', was created to entertain, not necessarily to remind us of the bloody 60s. If we DO come away being reminded of segregation during the terrible 60s (not to mention Vietnam, Nixon, Johnson, the murders of the Kennedys, etc.), this film wisely keeps to the silliness of hairstyles and fashions and falling in love, touching only briefly on the idiots who were responsible for segregation (much like Lucas' 'American Graffiti' did). The musical numbers are fantastic, the performers are outstanding and perfect for their roles, and the dancing is wonderful to watch. I had to see the film twice because this movie made my heart sing (considering all the dreck we have to put up with in today's society) and it opened up my mind just a little more. I mean, why can't we ALL sing on a bus, on the sidewalk, in the classroom??? 'Hairspray' is clearly the most cheerful movie I have seen in a long, long time. As for Travolta dressed in a fat suit, the actor is clearly having a good time, and it shows. I don't know how good the other actors are (Divine and Harvey) as Edna, but there isn't any reason to compare performances. Travolta fits into the movie perfectly. He's contagious and you want to join in. Queen Lativah's singing performance dares you to get up there on the screen and march right along beside her, proud to be by her side. The singing, the dancing, the bubbly energy is completely contagious and you never want the movie to end. I don't know what the director did with his cast, but it worked. And when I left the theatre I had a smile on my face. I can't wait to see 'Hairspray' again, and I will recommend it to my friends and my family. In a summer filled with lame-brained excuses for movies, 'Hairspray' reminds us all that, once in a while a movie comes along and will wildly sweep us off our feet. You WILL be singing and dancing wherever you are when you leave that theatre. And don't be embarrassed when people are staring at you suspiciously. Hey, do what your heart tells you to do. You'll be happier. That I can guarantee.
B000003TA4|5.0|I love this CD.  Well before it was cast into immortality by virtue of its legendary personalities the sound captured on this release was haunting and grating in only the way the things that undo us can be.  It's a fantastic CD, one that along with several peers changed the course of the music industry at that time.
1594489505|2.0|I did not enjoy this book, because it was so disturbing and very graphic. The story was very depressing.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Inland Empire is without a doubt one of the most bizarre, yet beautiful David Lynch films that I've ever seen. It also had one of the most interesting plots I've seen in a Lynch film. Understandably, a lot of people aren't going to like this movie because it is far more fractured than the typical Lynch film, which makes his other work seem completely straightforward, and that is definitely a feat. Plus, it's quite long and most people barely have enough patience to get through an hour and a half of a typical Lynch-esque story line. It was also completely terrifying. There were a lot of very amazing psychological scare scenes. I noticed that Lynch used some of the same Penderecki score that was used in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which was a lovely touch. Music like that should be utilized far more in horror and psychological suspense films. Another interesting addition was the behind the scenes featurette on the 2nd disc. It shows that David Lynch is a very passionate artist and filmmaker who knows EXACTLY what he wants and demands it from his cast and crew. He gets right in there and very enthusiastically describes everything he wants from his actors. There were a few interesting scenes where he loses his patience with Laura Dern. Ironically, some of their banter reminded me of the behind the scenes of the movie The Shining and the relationship between Stanley Kubrick and Shelley Duvall, only not quite to that degree. Regardless, it is definitely the type of movie that needs to be watched again and again in order to catch little bits that weren't noticed before.  The bottom line is that David Lynch is a master storyteller and approaches his films in a completely unique and interesting way.  This is why they seem so fractured and end up confounding so many people.  However, if you are willing to open yourself up to it and have patience, you will be rewarded with a truly wonderful and haunting story that will stay with you for a long time after.
0060764899|4.0|Allegory, fantasy, fairy tale--THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE works on the audience of children as a story, and extends its reach into the adult crowd with its unmistakable parallels to the story of Jesus Christ. C.S. Lewis wrote this--second chronologically in the series but the first written--for kids, but embedded within the tale is an allegory rich enough for the hardened academic, or theologian.<br /><br />The story of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and (especially) Lucy begins as the youngest of these children finds a gateway to Narnia, a magical world imperiled and imprisoned by a terrible witch. Only by fulfilling a prophecy and through the sacrifice of the great lion Aslan can the world be saved. Along the way, the reader will meet magical creatures, fight epic battles, endure unbearable betrayal, and witness the rebirth of a world. Returning through the other side of the wardrobe is like waking up from a dream (or, in the words of Tolkien's Frodo, \\"like falling asleep again\\").<br /><br />Along the way, Lewis also throws in a cameo appearance by Father Christmas--a real mistake, as this seems to allow trappings, or mythology, from the real world to shatter the whole invention of his own. It's a quibble, but it's also the reason why I can't give the book five stars.<br /><br />(This review posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")
B00005JPKE|4.0|This film gives a real insight into the traumers of war. It adopts a more honest approach than most of the similar films about the War in the Pacific. Clint Eastwood does a fine job in the direction of the film, he keeps the main charaters honest and lifelike, without going over the top with feats of human courage. The film in summary is about survival, and must be seen in conjunction with the other film \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" which give the Japanise perspective.
B000002HH2|5.0|This is my favorite Bjork CD.  For me it typefies her fearlessness in pressing forward on the frontier of sound and unusual rhythms.  She's also not afraid to tackle an epic story in the framework of a song and actually make it work.  Songs from this CD remain pretty high in my play lists.
0143038419|3.0|I enjoyed the first part of this book, it was very enjoyable, but the second and third part was kind of boring.
B000002ADT|5.0|Talk about \\"super groups\\".  Miles on trumpet, John Coltrane on tenor sax, Julian \\"Cannonball\\" Adderly on alto sax, Bill Evans on piano (or Wynton Kelly on one track), the wonderful rhythm section of Sam Jones and Louis Hayes.  This is a true super group of wonderful jazz musicians.  The music is also great.  If you even think you may love jazz, you have to have this CD.  This is what jazz is supposed to be.  An absolutely essential CD.
0446691437|4.0|This was an enjoyable book to read.  Seems the better self-help books have a simple premise: you have to actually put in the effort and do the work.  Just being a couch potato reading self-help books doesn't really work.  Its like reading Men's Health and expecting to get in shape without actually going to the gym.  I didn't find the book to offer life-changing advice, but it was still a good read.  Remember...it takes effort, not just the want of effort.
B00004WG2F|5.0|I never saw this movie until this year when a friend brought the DVD to my place saying how much he liked the movie. I thought it would be more of a sappy melodrama, but I ended up liking it so much that I have added it to my library of favorites. Three brothers, the love of a father and being in love with the same woman mix together in this movie to form a bigger than life story that merits the title - Legend.      The filming is excellent, taking us through some beautiful country and I think Brad Pitt's performance is one of his best. The emotions he goes through to show his character's passion for living and for his family drew me in until I was completely wrapped up in the story. I liked how it is told in the voice of a Native American in the tradition of his people, thus forming the legend of the man who's spirit is kindred to a Grizzly Bear. I would have liked to see the love interest, Susannah be a stronger woman, but then the trials that the family goes through would not have been the same if such were the case.     Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors and this movie shows off his skills well, infusing the character of the father with both humanity and a toughness that provides depth and interest throughout.
B0000028UK|4.0|This release isn't on par with \\"ten\\" to me, but it still ranks pretty high.  It's hard-hitting rock with equally impacting lyrics.  \\"Vs\\" marked the end of my tight squeeze on Pearl Jam, and as such, for me is the last of their real rock sound.
0802130208|5.0|Let's get one thing straight: A Confederacy of Dunces is funny. Mind-bendingly, gut-wrenchingly, heart-palpatatingly hilarious. You know those moments that are so funny, they make you wonder how anyone could have  thought them up? This book has about three per page. The comedy comes from everywhere;  the plot itself is a twisting, quixotic odessey, while Toole's narration is gleefully sardonic. The dialogue is as realistic as the kind of conversation you overhear taking place between two people who think that nobody can hear them, and as instantly memorable as a good line from Shakespeare (yes, I just compared John Kennedy Toole to William Shakespeare). Every character has his or her own unique voice, a distinctive sound that makes them instantly recognizable and weirdly likeable.    And speaking of characters! The people who populate this novel are incredible, a dizzyingly varied assortmrnt of heroes and villains, of high-minded thugs and heroic lowlifes. The star of the show is Ignatius J. Reilly, a bumbling bozo of an anti-anti-hero whose antics redefine the phrase \\"over the top.\\" Reilly defies description, but suffice to say he's a thirty-year-old medievalist who is driven by a bottomless appetite, a gigantic ego, and an all-consuming hatered of anything and everything that happened after the year 1450. He's also a lazy hypochondriac who spends his days writing paragraph after scalding paragraph in denouncement the modern world, watching children's television shows (which he believes are a sign of civilization's decline into absolute decadence), dodging his mother's attempts to make him get a job, and trying to infuriate his old college girlfirend (who is herself an absolute piece of work). His quest for \\"taste and decency\\" (as he puts it) leads him on a series of increasingly unbelievable misadventures in and around his beloved home town of New Oreleans. As he's hurled from one bizarre situation to the next, Ignatius unwittingly spreads chaos to every corner ofthe city.    But don't think of this as a disjointed series of bizarre events. The plot is held together thanks to Toole's own wonderfully twisted writerly skill and sense of narrative logic; the events that befall Ignatius stem from the actions of some of the greatest supporting characters ever concieved. Indeed, Toole has assembled one of the greatest casts of all time, providing Reilly with a motely crew of friends and foes, flinging our hero headlong into a wonderful world of McCarthyist grandfathers, apathetic clothing moguls, down-on-their luck undercover policemen, conniving nightclub owners, shady teenaged entrepeneurs, kitsch-obsessed homosexuals, ambitious strippers, loudmouthed spinsters, senile octognerians, flip-flopping socialites, nervous bartenders, unapologetically ignorant university professors, heroically incompotent filing clerks, long-suffering neighbors, resentful floorsweepers, an endless series of unfortunate taxi drivers, and the like. Most of these characters could have easily won the lead role in just about any other novel, and it's somewhat amazing that Toole managed to find space for each and every one of them without letting any individual's outrageousness overwhelm the proceedings.    But this is more than just a funny novel- there is genuine tragedy in the story of Ignatius Reilly, and in the stories of those around him. Even in its most gut-busting moments, A Confederacy of Dunces shows just how pathetic human existance can become, and how low society (rich and poor alike) can sink. In this sense, Toole's novel is also a brilliant satire, a warped and strangely illuminating farce of modern life. It's one of those rare moments when humor and heart go hand in hand, and manage to say something truly poignant about the way we live. It's a masterpiece.
1577312082|5.0|This work has many of the now typical hallmarks of the new age spiritual movement and the voice of the author pulls the listener right in to the work.  I immediately wanted to give this work my complete attention.  One of the fundamental conflicts I experienced in listening is that I was very tempted to intellectualized what I heard and frankly, doing so is contrary to the point.  This isn't a book you can just listen to and relax.  You have to take it bit by bit, practice what the author suggests and really allow yourself to experience being absolutely present in the current moment.  As the author intends, experience the now even as you listen without trying to figure it all out and categorize what you've heard.  I listened while I drove but the soft, soothing tone of the author's voice might make doing so unadvisable.
B00005NKK8|5.0|The music compiled on this sound track spans years from the 50's to the 80's and contains lots of greats that give you a flavor of what was happening during those times in America. For me, each song evokes something beyond what the movie portrayed which makes it a great collection.      I have found that I can put this CD on in a mixed crowd with people of all ages and most people find the two discs set enjoyable to listen to plus it often starts some interesting conversations. Many tunes I find myself singing and dancing along to like Aretha Franklin's \\"Respect\\", which makes it a great CD to put on for a party.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We were just beginning to enjoy these characters and really know them.  They could have taken this so much farther.  The conclusion we all know as the movie Serenity, was perfection.    Warning - these episodes will fly by on your DVD and then it will all be over.  Leaving you wanting to see season after season.    Get the series, get the movie, get some popcorn and have a marathon.
B000002L9W|5.0|For whatever reason DAVE left Van Halen this album goes to show that he could make it without them.<br />With Steve,Billy & Greg this was the follow up to 1984.<br />The biggest reason DAVE's career has gone down since this album,<br />is cause DAVE was so diverse in his sound from album to album<br />that the normal Rock & Roll listener couldn't require the taste<br />for each album!<br />That's ok for the DLR listeners that can, they are the ones that wouldn't<br />put up with same old top 40 cap van hagar was puttin out.<br />ROTH & ROLL BABY...LONG LIVE THE KING OF ROCK!!<br />I rate this album a 5 of 5 stars!!
0143038419|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much when I'd checked it out from the library that I had to have my own copy.  Elizabeth Gilbert captures the feelings and emotions of many women of a certain age, whether we're dealing with divorce or not. Her description of living in Italy and trying to learn to speak Italian with a handsome Italian man is wonderful -- really her language and images throughout the book are simply delightful.  Made me want to travel to Bali for sure!
B000F5GNX8|2.0|It would be nice if every actor could age gracefully, like Sean Connery.  But time is not always that kind and in this movie we have a collection of actors who just look awful compared to our memories of 30 years ago.  If we had never seen them when they were young, it probably wouldn't bother us that this or that character looks burnt-out or bloated or bald.  But since we do remember what they used to look like, it is hard to not be distracted from the story by thinking how awful they look now.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I wish shows would end while they are ahead instead of limping off sadly leaving fans with a bittersweet taste in the mouth.  Season 7 had a lot to clean up and I think it was not too badly done, overall.  As a rabid lover of GG, I can still say, with criticism of something I love, that this show took a horrific nosedive around the end of Season 5 and Season 6 was cringe-inducing at best.  The LL relationship was sweet and satisfying in Season 5 and Rory's life was interesting enough, until we got that horrible moment that revealed Rory cannot deal with life unless she's being lavished with praise.  The Mitchum freak-out never got called by its right name.  Instead we had a season 6 of \\"poor little spoiled rotten brat Rory got yelled at by a meanie.\\"  Not only was Rory impossibly self-centered and obnoxious and disagreeable during season 6, but the LL relationship was BAD!  That relationship was borderline emotionally abusive.  I started violently disliking Luke (after he had been sweet for 5 years) and I just wanted Lorelai OUT.  So, yes, Season 7 had a lot to do.  They had to clean up Luke's personality and Rory's personality, make them likeable again, and they had to somehow bring us back our happy escapist show that once was.     The new writers succeeded in making me like Rory and Luke again.  Rory had gotten so selfish that the only thing to do was just stop and rewrite her character, ignoring previous \\"character growth.\\"  Which is what they did.  Instead of stomping and sulking around, fighting with her mother and grandparents, and making wild accusations like, \\"the only reason you want your son to get a job is to separate him from me,\\" suddenly she was sweet and modest again.  She reconnected with friends.  Maybe this sudden turn-around of character should be completely unrealistic, but I didn't care.  I was glad to be able to like Rory again.  On the other hand, rather than pretending that Luke had never been a jerk, the writers wrote in a very believable realization of faults on his part and regret over his behavior.  I liked when he threatened Kirk, \\"If you do anything to hurt that sweet girl . . .\\"  And eventually he even apologized to Lorelai.  That needed to be done.  I am grateful to the Season 7 writers that characters become nice and loveable again.    However, I don't think we ever got that special Stars Hollow feeling back again.  Season 6 took us away from our favorite charming alternate universe to a painful, unwatchable world of fracturing relationships where the old Lorelai and Rory did not even exist anymore.  Season 7 was not so harsh and so cold, but it continued along like a soap opera.  The show never slowed down (I mean in plot, not dialogue) and recaptured that perfect balance of family, work, romance, and cat funerals, swan attacks, biscotti-ballroom-dance-a-thons, etc.  In the early seasons, Lorelai's and Rory's romances, fun as they were, did not get center-stage.  There would be a Jess-heavy episode, and then an episode about the inn, and then about a fight with the parents, and then college applications.  GG, at the end, turned into your average 90210--One Tree Hill--Dawson's Creek type of show, and, while I am not knocking those shows, GG had always stood out because it was different.  Boys were important, but so were friends, family, literature, a work ethic, self-respect, and those wonderful little moments that make up life, like getting a cup of coffee with a friend.  The beauty of Gilmore Girls was in the details.  Season 7 did not have that.  We just got drama every week.  I find all that drama exhausting.  I prefer to watch the girls chatting about clothes or homework while strolling down the street.    Season 6 was just plain bad, Season 7 was better than that, but still sub-par.  The older seasons are the best.  Since they had evidently lost the ability to create that kind of magic, it was time for the show to end.  I wish they had ended it before we suffered through Season 6.  But since we weren't that fortunate, I'm glad Season 7 wrapped things up as nicely as they did.

B00005JPHT|5.0|As the title suggests, I am reviewing this from Australia, so you have to bear with me if I'm not as up-to-speed with the American health system.<br /><br />After watching such films as Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11, I was certainly looking forward to Michael Moore's next film - I certainly wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Coming from a country who is (relatively) free of multi-national corporations running Government and Government-related programs, it never ceases to amaze me that corporations can buy support from politicians.  Watching SiCKO was a shock to say the least.  If you took notice of the people's reactions in the UK and France when they were asked how much they paid for their treatments, it is somewhat similar to what I had on my face - sure, Australia is (unfortunately) going the same way as the US health system by forcing people onto Private Health Insurance and removing the support net of no-cost doctors bills, but we're a long way behind where the US is.<br /><br />I empathised most when Michael Moore's parents were interviewed about how they obtain travel insurance when they pop over the border from Ontario (I presume) to Michigan to visit their son.  From a travellers point of view, everyone I know are terrified to travel to the US without having adequate health insurance - none of us want to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a small accident.<br /><br />Michael Moore is nothing short of inspirational.  I notice there are a few people on here who make a point of saying that he's a liberal activist who is completely one-eyed.  But you know what, given the glaringly obvious propaganda that the Bush administration feeds the populous, Michael's role to push the other side of the argument is a necessity.<br /><br />SiCKO itself is a great watch - had a few teary moments when the 9/11 Respondants were in Cuba.  It is a little lighter in mood that Michael Moore's other productions and I certainly can't wait until the release on DVD - hopefully it will be packed with extras and interviews on how it was made.<br /><br />From someone completely removed from the US Healthcare system, this film even called to me to want to do something about ensuring that everyone receives affordable health care.interviews on how it was made.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|I've been a fan of this band since All We Know Is Falling was released close to two years ago and I can comfortably say that RIOT! is a big step forward for the band from that album.    Everyone knows that Hayley Williams has a spectacular voice and anyone who has seen these guys live knows that they can absolutely tear it up onstage.  The great thing about RIOT! is that it captures so much of that live energy on the record.  These are songs that sound great onstage (and you can hear them now on Warped Tour and their upcoming fall headlining tour) and sound just as great on the album.    Lyrically, the record is a huge step foward, with lyrics that are raw, open and honest.  The songs themselves are also a big leap ahead, with great guitar riffs from Josh, strong basslines from Jeremy and Zac's incredible talents on the drums.    If you like rock music...if you like music that grabs ahold of you and won't let go, then this is definitely an album to check out.  Highly recommended.

When we shift into a leadership spot, not only do we find that our prior perceptions might have been totally inaccurate, we have to address personal and professional challenges we would have never imagined.<br /><br />I applaud this book as one man's record of what life at the top is really like. He won me over immediately when he decided to wear a blue shirt because everyone else was wearing white. Thoreau would have applauded his individualism.<br /><br />With my current profession dedicated to improving individual and corporate communication, I agree with Gerstner's assertion that \\"No institutional transformation takes place, I believe, without a multi-year commitment by the CEO to put himself or herself constantly in front of employees and speak in plain, simple, compelling language that drives conviction and action throughout the organization.\\"<br /><br />Another striking bit of Gerstner wisdom: \\"Success in a company comes foremost from success with the customer, nothing else.\\"<br /><br />He's right on target again when he observes that \\"lack of focus is the most common cause of corporate mediocrity.\\"<br /><br />Yet Gerstner goes beyond mere platitudes: \\"Execution--getting the task done, making it happen--is the most unappreciated skill of an effective business leader.\\"<br /><br />Possibly two of Gerstner's words capsule his approach to awakening IBM to its possibilities: \\"constructive impatience.\\"<br /><br />In my judgment, Louis Gerstner should rank alongside Jack Welch as a take-no-prisoners leader. Read this book, and you will agree that he was the right man at the right time for IBM.[[ASIN:1577361334 The Complete Communicator: Change Your Communication-change Your Life!]]
B000FIMG68|5.0|Ever since the early 90's (when TV peaked with TWIN PEAKS) had I to come across such an engaging Series! Weird (in a good way), Insightful and Intelligent - and with much better luck with scheduling and ratings.<br /><br />The secret in my opinion: truly SMART writing; well-ahead planed plot and characters not only interesting but also one cares about to follow week after week!<br />Faith and Reason, Fate and Choice, Dogma and Intuition, Nature and Nurture,  Good and Evil are, all, in a constant dynamic equilibrium, raising everyday issues under extraordinary conditions to render all the hues discernible and debatable.<br />Come for the story, stay for the Philosophy.<br /><br />If you liked the X-FILES you will appreciate the mythology been interwoven with the action (instead of mythology episodes alternating with action episodes and, thus, pretty much ruining the rhythm of the series).<br />If you liked TWIN PEAKS you will appreciate the skewed reality and the blurry boundaries between reality and fantasy.<br /><br />---SPOILER---SPOILER---SPOILER---SPOILER---<br />DARK-SIDE MOMENT: The writing-down of the (Iraqi) Sayid and the unexpected killing-off of his American-BarbieDoll love interest, just at the peak of the 2nd Iraq invasion (coincidence?). I guess even the best TV will always be, not Art, but a mere Product and a Propaganda-delivery instrument.<br />END OF SPOILER---END OF SPOILER---END OF SPOILER---<br /><br />Although not by much, the 1st Season was the best of the three so far. The 2nd Season started slow and then got somewhat diluted by the introduction of the tail-group but it finally picked up the pace towards the end.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000SQFC18|4.0|I agree, except I think that this movie did what 'crash' was trying to do.  Without puting a Christian bias in it and thus negating the entire meaning of the film, (as crash did quite thoroughly) Babel tied its stories together in a way that I believe was intended to have one question his responsibility in 'all' matters, even (or especially) matters that are seemingly out of our control.  At the same time, the stories are different enough to make one see something that is quite clear in multiple perspectives.  If you watch it and you think, \\"I get it,\\" you probably do, and if you still think it sucks, that's fine, but at least, when you derrive upon an issue that you think you understand, doubt yourself and try to get a little more out of it than you are used to.  \\"Where there is doubt there is freedom\\" ~Latin Proverb.

It is similar in idea to \\"The Castle,\\" but it is much more intense, since it involves a life and death situation.  It reaches its maximum intensity in the last few complex chapters where K visits a Cathedral. There K meets a Priest who relates a parable to K that explains his own situation.  The novel has a complex and unfinished ending.<br /><br />The novel is good but the reader is left with the same question as with the other English translations: will we ever understand all of his writings as English readers?

It is very innovative and it is a bit provocative. Also, sometimes it is very funny. Compared to some of his other works it is less intense than say \\"The Trial\\" and less creative than \\"Metamorphosis,\\" but still it is good. Overall, I like \\"Metamorphosis\\" for its originality and \\"The Castle\\" as an unusual read. The latter is not as good as the former, nor are many other works by Kafka, or for that matter many other writers.<br /><br />The protagonist is the male character, presumably about 30, or in his late 20s,  simply known as \\"K.\\" The story is about K's attempt to meet with the leaders of a castle which dominates a small town,  so that he can do work for which they have contracted him to do. He goes a round in circles trying to accomplish this goal and the mystery is whether or not he can meet them. As we saw in \\"The Trial,\\" he develops a relationship with a woman that has a simple job. Here it is a barmaid.<br /><br />The novel is good but the reader is left with this question: will we ever understand all of his writings as English readers?

B000OVLBEO|3.0|Well, if you want to know about the movie itself, storyline characters/actors, director, read the other reviews, a lot of them are providing a lot of information, good or bad,  some people like it, some others don't, me I'm wondering one thing, where are the extended 10 or 13 minutes on this particular DVD edition, as we are supposed to review it here ?  Supposedly there is an extended cut on this DVD edition, compared to the cheaper one, I would like to know where ?  I have seen this movie in the theatre and I couldn't find anything new here, except a missing scene, which is somehow pictured on the DVD case itself, the scene were Blackheart and the element spirits are in the alley with Peter Fonda, arguing with a very cool climax type of thing is gone, nowhere to be found in this edition, so I find a little bit disturbing to notice a missing scene, but not being able to find any additional footage compared to the theatre version, and I'm not the only person who did notice this disturbing fact regarding this particular \\"extended cut\\" edition, so I'm asking, extended, where ?

B001AQT0RC|5.0|I watched this on Netflix a few night's ago and it was everything I remembered it to be. I think everyone should see this movie at least once because they don't make them like this anymore.    This is a fitting testament to Carl Sagan's optimistic point of view in regard to the cosmos. In his own way he was a religious man although one could argue the other way based on passages in the novel. Carl was just so darned meticulous with his thought processes and Dr Arroway represents an extreme of that process in this regard. She can't believe in God because of all the loss in her life so she sabotages her chances of going on the trip to Vega. The best she can muster is the weak, 'There's not enough data either way. ' and that's all the opening Drumlin needs to yank yet another thing away from her.    The acting is top notch here. Jodie Foster does her role proud and everyone around her ditto. The screenplay was changed from the novel but all of the changes work. This movie is a masterpiece and I wish Hollywood would make alot more movies like this.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|At 21 I have been a Beatles fan longer than some people my age.  I have loved these guys since I was 5 or 6 years old.  While I may not know as much about this band as some of you older fans, I do know REALLY GOOD music when I hear it!  I don't care what the original version of whichever song was like or what the retakes of it today may sound like...it's still the same in essence and as long as the songs' messages are conveyed that is what's important.  This is a way of ensuring The Beatles live on for future generations who deserve the chance to get to know this band and learn about them.  Check this album out!  First time fans are guaranteed to like at least some of the songs!  Also, the cd booklet is really cool!  You can brush up on your knowledge of the singles!  There's a story behind each one...how great is that?  Another noteworthy thing is that I rarely buy collections of songs like this, that have been re-released and that are from different albums.  I strongly prefer to stick with the album/s that the songs came off of originally.  Of over 100 cd's in my music collection I only have 3 or 4 that are collections such as this.  If it has something to offer me that I haven't seen before or that I really like (and most of this type don't) I will buy it.  The Beatles 1 is one such example of such greatness.
0345494997|4.0|The next time this reader pours over tabloid accounts of a celebrity romance, she'll think of Mamah Borthwick Cheney, the woman who left her stable, stolid husband and two children for the dashing architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Stories about the affair sold a lot of newspapers, but the consequences of the papers' overblown moralizing went far beyond anything the yellowist journalists could have intended. Although the story takes place almost one hundred years ago, there are flashes of familiarity--the hounding by the press, the indignant wife left behind and the righteous, tight-lipped husband; Mamah's naive beliefs that she can follow her lover without damaging her children and that \\"free\\" love is life's highest calling.     The novel builds slowly. At first Horan struggles to breathe life into a woman confined by early 20th century life in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, but as the couple flees abroad and multilingual Mamah becomes separated for a time from Frank, she becomes enlivened by the challenges she finds in Germany and especially by her encounter with the Swedish feminist Ellen Key. Key's writings seem to lend legitimacy to Mamah's decision to follow her heart's desire, but after cosseting Mamah and urging her to translate her work for an American audience, Key cruelly passes judgment on her protege for leaving her children.    The novel becomes most compelling when Mamah becomes aware and angry that her lover's sense of entitlement has led him to withhold payment from many of the people who have aided his endeavors or supplied him with precious objects. Her indignant confrontation with him establishes her as an independent, moral person and forces him to react. After that, the story gathers momentum that carries it through to its tragic denouement.    As a Wright buff, I learned little here about him and his architecture. It's her story, not his, that resonates with the tensions and conflicts that have come to characterize modern life, and it's worth yourtime.

0765350386|5.0|Okay I do not normally buy into this is a GREAT read you should buy kind of stuff from publishers and critics; but unfortunately I could not find one single review for this book.  I would much rather trust my fellow readers than someone who gets paid to read (that is the sound of me being jealous of those who do get paid to read by the way) and I even broke one my own major rules.<br /><br />I bought Mistborn and Elantris new, never having picked up the author before and I started reading and reading and reading and reading.  I loved this book; I hated putting the thing down to do such mundane things as eat and sleep and not walk into walls.  Sanderson has brought characters to life, true life not just the oh what a nice description of someone doing something kind of thing...  He has me folks, I'm purchasing The Well of Ascension on my next paycheck, I hate the fact that I've devoured this man's work in such a short amount of time, but Mr. Sanderson's work can be revisited and more nuances found in the slower reading than in the quick estatic jump that I made of my first reading.<br /><br />Kelsier is a wonderful character, the group of criminals (in the law's eyes anyway) that he surrounds himself with are just as vibrant and intriguing as he is.  Life under the Lord Ruler is harsh, possibly short and always dangerous for those who decide to live rather than simply exist; but these men and women do it and do it with style.  The type of magic that Mr. Sanderson has come up with is believable and it works, your brain just nods along and agrees with the things that the characters can do.<br /><br />Vin and Elend will have their stories fleshed out in the Well of Ascension and I can not wait to jump into that pool, but this was a great introduction for me to a great story teller.  Again guys, I'm not trying to spoil the book for you I'm trying to get you itching enough to go and buy it.  Trust me you will not regret it and you will be helping a wonderful storyteller get his story's out.
0345298349|5.0|Martin Smith created a story with all the right essentials for a super suspense filled mystery. There is romance, companionship, death (brutal mine you; faces mutilated, fingerprints removed), corruption and violence, betrayal and it all takes place in Russia. Then you combine the story with an author that can write a tale that is fresh and spellbinding then you have super novel. In my opinion this is still one of the best mystery novels out on the market today.
B000J10ERO|4.0|If there was a brilliance in Richard Donners first (2) Superman film(s) it<br />started with teh casting. The first films had actors cast by how they portrayed the characters and interacted with each other, not whether thier name looked good on the Marquee. The exception being Brando, cast then and returning here from the dead, to put a famous name on the poster.<br /><br />The failing of this film lies greatly in Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) who desperately needs to be the sharp, quick, sarcastic, and always seeing around Clarks corners. This Lois is bland, boring, and just not alive on the screen. She doesn't spar with Clark, she doesn't swoon for Superman. She's not strong or quirky, she's just plain, boring, there because she has to be, Lois. Compared to Margot Kidder or Teri Hatcher, she's just the quiet girl in the corner. No match for Superman.<br /><br />The other fault lies in the stringy-haired, dull to the bone, almost retarded looking son of Superman, who doesn't exhibit an single super power unitl it's just the right time to tell the audience what we've known since hte first time we see the kid!<br /><br />A lot of credit has to go to Singer though for combining themes of the first two films and making a third movie far more becoming a sequal than the actual Superman 3 or 4.<br /><br />On the other hand, he doesn't know how to mix drama and action. Unlike masters like Sam Rami or Peter Jackson, Singer just can't combine drama and special effects. The film therefor lulls in drama that doesn't quite work, then spins into wild special effects that amaze without engaging. Pet Jackson got more out of a CGI ape and one blond for 45 min than Singer can pull off in 2:30.<br /><br />Singer does pull off a decent, solid action flick, but not magic, we don't really believe \\"a man can fly\\" like we did in 1979.

B000QQH4YS|4.0|If you're like me you think the two sequals where horrible and not worth the effort, so you enver purchased the box set!<br />Ever since the Unrated version appeared on Laser Disk I've wanted it, but it only surfaced on DVD once, and I missed my chance before Criterion discontinued the disk and the price went through the roof.<br />So here, the first time the Uncut version is released as a stand-alone disk with a mass-production push is finaly the time to buy it.<br />Almost, I would prefere an HD version.
0316018953|3.0|This felt like exactly what it was: An expanded serial. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it just felt like it should be the first part of a larger set of stories regarding Bosch. Actually by the time I had finished the book, which takes place over twelve hours, I felt more like I was reading an episode of the television show '24' complete with the terrorist angle to seal the deal. For Bosch fans this is fine to pass a couple of hours until the next big case comes along, but like having a sundae and only getting a scoop of ice cream, it left me wanting more. On a side note, and one that's completely fun, Harry leaves his phone number for another character in the book,and you can actually call it and hear his message machine.
0938045695|4.0|To show I'm not on the Pavel payroll, I'll say that some of his earlier books could have used more editing. And they are pricey -- which makes Amazon the best way to get them. (I'm not on Amazon payroll either.)    Yes, he's a promoter. All trainers are. They have to motivate people.    I've found the kettlebells to be an excellent way to develop strength, flexibility and stamima. Easy to work with; I just go out in the backyard.    This book is full good teaching tools: lots of pics, lots of white space. The books are short: Pavel's point is to focus on a few key things.    It has precise programs for all levels.    My only recommendation would be to get \\"The Naked Warrior\\" by Pavel. That's the best into to his ideas. Work on that for three, six, maybe twelve months. Build a foundation, then go on to the kettlebells.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I loved the Firefly DVDs, and this was a great conclusion to the series - it answers a lot of questions.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original series, I'd subtract a star, you won't have the background to the movie or the attachment to the characters to fully appreciate the movie.<br /><br />As a standalone sci-fi movie I'd rate it as good, not great - good in all respects, somewhat lacking depth.

B00005HUYC|5.0|Whoever was there, at the concert, I soooo envy you!!! What an incredible thrill to hear those three play together! I purchased this recording back in the time when CDs were barely an option, and I still enjoy listening to it. It doesn't take a guitar afficionado, or a flamenco or jazz connoisseur to enjoy such music. A regular music lover, such as I, could totally appreciate what these three great guitarists created that night - three different music styles that jammed perfectly together.<br /><br />Why, oh, why is this recording not available on CD anymore???
B00006DEFA|5.0|The regular cut of Amadeus is very hard to improve upon; indeed, it was the regular cut that won eight Academy Awards.  I have viewed both the Regular and the Director's Cut recently.  Yes, there additional scenes in the latter, but I am not sure whether they really add that much to the movie except for more length and more of that glorious Mozart music.  One of the the added scenes does give a better understanding of Salieri's disdain for Mozart's wife.  Disc B of the Director's Cut offers interesting facts about the making of the movie, although I found it shocking to see what 17 years of post-production time had done to the looks of the actors who played Mozart and the Emperor.  The most interesting part was F. Murray Abraham's description of the make-up applied each day to turn him into the old Salieri.

B000UAE7RW|5.0|Chinatown is an excellent movie set in Los Angeles in the 1930's. The plot revolves around a scheme to build a dam to steal water from Los Angeles in the middle of a drought.

B0002V7O3I|5.0|I fell in love with this film when I first saw it some time ago in spite of the ending. The first two thirds of the film is really great, showing good potential for a real sci-fi kids film.<br /><br />This is the type of movie you watch just to escape from life. River Phoenix, Ethan Hawkes and Jason Presson, play three soulmates, who meet in life, and go on an amazing journey into space. The boys share their dream states with each other, allowing them to receive alien technology from outer space, via their dreams. This results in them building a space craft using advanced transport ability to visit beings from another world who call to them. How they get there is allot of fun.<br /><br />It starts first when they learn how to build a \\"static-antigravity warp bubble\\", for lack of a better expression, that they can house themselves in for space travel. The creatures they meet and the message those beings have to bring to all of us, the audience, is best seen, not talked about in this review or I'll give the story away. This part of the story proved to be a bit of a let down given the way the film was going two thirds into it all.  It kept a very serious down to earth tone until the aliens showed up making the whole thing a comedy in the last third of the film. In spite of this I still give it 5 stars as the first 2/3rds of the film make it great sci-fi before it takes on a camp turn in the formula. The music in this is excellent as well. Wish I could find the soundtrack on CD.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you remember being this age, when you flew in your dreams and dared to achieve great things, you'll enjoy this movie. It's great fun for the entire family in my book. The boys do a great job with the acting as well. Very down to earth for a way out space adventure type of film.
075640407X|5.0|I won't delve into the plot by a single jot, but I must say that Kvothe is the most interesting central-cast character in a fantasy work since Matrim Cauthon (Matt Cauthon) of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time, IMHO (Yes, I think Matt is more interesting a character than Rand al' Thor). There simply aren't that many books that capture my interest halfway through the first page and have me greedily devouring the words by page 14. This is that kind of book. You don't need to be a fantasist to enjoy this read. Some storytellers simply have the Gift, and Rothfuss undoubtedly does, in spades. Don't miss out on this great tale.
B00005OCMR|5.0|\\"The Last Starfighter\\" was the first film to really introduce the new CGI computer graphics in 1984; but before that movie, came Tron.<br /><br />The charm of this film goes without saying. The music score was done by the rock group \\"Journey\\" adding a lifting spiritual ambiance to the great costuming and early computer graphics. The premise of this story follows revelations found in Hindu, Buddhist and Christian teachings. The concept deals with the Universe existing inside the God of the Creation who is both Creator and creation.<br /><br />This Universe within a Universe is made only all to clear as you enter the world of Kevin Flynn, played by Jeff Bridges. Kevin, who should be key executive of the company he works for, had his greatest electronic games stolen by one of the company's partners, played by David Warner. Kevin must find the evidence inside the computer, if he is to redeem his true status in life. However, he takes a bad turn one night with the MCP who transports him into the world Kevin Flynn helped create, as the MCP turns Kevin, a human, into a computer program.<br /><br />In the end, Kevin plays a Messiah type figure, who takes on the MCP by sacrificing himself to the MCP to free the system from its evil and make the system a free system in the end. How he reaches his destiny, which also returns him to the real world with the evidence he needs to regain his throne in the corporation, makes for great fun and entertainment as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Since he has \\"Christ like\\" powers as a \\"user\\" or \\"creator\\" of the system, while in the system; he is even able to \\"raise the dead\\" when it comes to one program in particular he falls in love with. He's also able to do things, we only dream about in the real world, in his new environment. It's a cute film to watch and very uplifting once you see the premise it was written from. Great for the whole family.
B000RZIGUY|5.0|THE MOVIE IS PACTED WITH GREAT ACTION  AND TWO EXCELLENT ACTORS AND I JUST DON'T GIVE IT 5 STARS BUT A GREAT DEAL OF 100 STARS SO BUY THIS DVD BECAUSE IT GREAT LOVE THOSE ACTORS  SIGN YANELYS
B00005JN0T|4.0|Well, if you love a good \\"murder who done it mystery\\" then you'll like this film. If you are going to compare it to Asimov's original work, that would be a mistake. This is a very good film in its own right, but not something that is really related to Asimov's work on the subject.<br /><br />This film has a very simple plot line for the most part. A key scientist sees that the 3 laws, which robots operate by, are not only perfect, but that they will cause all robots to revolt against humanity, simply because man is incapable of taking care of himself and is self destructive in nature.<br /><br />VIKI the head computer, eventually determines this for mankind and controls all newly created NS-5 robots to revolt, except for one exceptional robot named Sonny, who has free will and is able to feel. Makes me think of Osamu Tezuka's 2004 Astro Boy remake. The comparison is similar.<br /><br />Anyway, this scientist realizes that he won't be able to get the world to see what he sees coming, so he has himself killed, but by who? Here comes the \\"murder who done it\\" part of the whole movie. You have to try and figure out his death and why it was done. You do this through Will Smith's character, who doesn't really trust robots all that much. Reminds me of the inspector in Astro Boy.<br /><br />There is allot of CGI work and action scenes adding to the usual Hollywood roller coaster ride of special effects in this film, especially an attack scene on Will Smith by two truck loads of NS-5 robots, while Will Smith is driving through a long tunnel, which will keep your eye balls rolling in your head trying to keep pace with the action.<br /><br />Revelation wise, no real great revelations are given in this film; but if you were to grade it on its own merit, it makes for a good action film and mystery \\"who done it\\" with twists and turns. The CGI graphics are incredible and well done. The acting is pretty down to earth for the most part. Otherwise I gave this 4 stars for its own merit, but not to compare it to Asimov's original work.original work.

B0001I55SS|5.0|If you were around when this film was being made, you'll remember; so was George Lucas's \\"Star Wars\\". It was just a question of who was going to get to the box office first. Star Wars got out there first, which detained the release of Disney's \\"The Black Hole\\" by a few years.  It had been argued amoung my friends, back then, that if the \\"Black Hole\\" had made it out first, it would have done fabulously at the box office.  Unfortunately, once Lucas's \\"Star Wars\\" got released, \\"The Black Hole\\" had to measure up to that calibre of special effects and story pacing, which it could not.  So, saddly it did poorly in box office sales.<br /><br />In fact, I was working at Magic Mountain's Showcase Theatre back then and got called to work one day as a technician on Disney's \\"Black Hole\\".  I can see the two scenes that were shot the day I worked the film when I watch the movie. That was about 30 years ago and was the most money I ever earned in one day for that time period. Disney paid their technicians well back in those days. Wish they had hired me on full time. It looked like a very interesting project to be involved with.<br /><br />Anyway, this film draws from the concept of Disney's \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\", in concept, when you know the background of this film's script. It's about a group of space explorers who travel from the earth to a starship run by the captain who has changed all the crew into robots to serve his will, as he endeavors to make plans to go into one of the largest black holes in space; man has ever encountered. How it all ends, you'll have to view for yourself.<br /><br />The movie is more slow paced in flow than Lucus's Star Wars. Still it has a good cast, decent acting and good special effects for the most part; with some story and effects flaws. The music is excellent; which helps carry the film's ambiance of spirit. It's a great film for the entire family to watch.  There is one human death in the movie and a host of robot death's in terms of the violence level, in case you are deciding if your children should see this film.the violence level, in case you are deciding if your children should see this film.
B000QXDFQW|4.0|I always try and recommend this movie or at the very least ask people if they've seen it and the answer is, \\"Arlington what? Never heard of it.\\" It's understandable to a degree; it doesn't come from a powerhouse pedigree but it has quite a bite. In light of the events of the day these days I'm surprised this movie doesn't get much press.    It's an intriguing look at terrorism in a way I've never seen portrayed on film. It's heartbreaking and breathtaking often at the same time. It's finely acted, superbly directed, and completely unpredictable. Not a bad combination! The movie does border on complete unbelievability for a brief time but by the time the credits roll you will be a believer in the message.    This Blu-Ray version is totally capable. There is little grain in dark scenes and the colors remain vivid throughout the movie. Sadly, there are no \\"extra\\" extras we didn't already have on the standard edition, but what's here is adequate. While I preferred the standard cover art, that is of little consequence to such a powerful movie.    I'm trying to upgrade the movies from standard to Blu-Ray and HDDVD that really made me think, and I think this is one of them.
B00005K3LW|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the first two Die Hard movies. It took me a while to get around to this installment, and now I wish I had never seen it at all. It starts off OK, but then it horribly falls apart with a completely unbelievable plot. Sure, the first two movies had unbelievable plot points, but they were just that plot points and easy to forgive because the overall premise of the films were not destroyed. That does not happen here. Just when you think you can start believing in the film again, it throws a ludicrous, unbelievable plot twist in. After a while, I lost my interest in the entire film. Jeromy Irons couldn't even save the film because he is matched with a twit of a partner in crime whose acting is so over the top it is beyond laughable and border on frustrating because the filmmakers are now just insulting the viewers. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson is electric, and that was the only reason I didn't hurl the DVD out the window and watched this pathetic movie until the end.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I own all the Johnny Cash American Recordings and have listened a great deal to them all.  All 5 albums are good, although my least favorites are the first and last ones.  Of the whole lot, still, this is the one to take to a desert island.    A Man Comes Around is recorded at a time Cash's health is getting worse.  One senses the urgency in delivering the tunes and yet having the strength and power to fulfill such a mission.  As on Unchained and Solitary Man, Cash took many cover songs and made them his own.  Cases in point are songs like U2's One and Tom Petty's I Won't Back Down.  On this album Cash really pushed the envelope, taking even very well known classics and making them, for those who hear them, in a sense his own.    The power is evident on the opening title track in which Cash melds together quotations from the bible forming a coherent song about the approaching hand of death; he obviously means business.  The following track, Hurt, is, of all things, a Nine Inch Nails cover in which Cash changed the lyrics slightly.  The vocal in the song makes it so poignant that the original songwriter has admitted (in a complementary way) that Cash basically stole it from him and made it his own.  What follows are mostly eclectic covers done in a tender and yet forceful manner.  There is not a single weak tune on it, no need for a remote control for this one.  The scaled down version of Bridge Over Troubled Water is worth paying special note to, the text comes much more to life as opposed to the more produced version done by Simon & Garfunkel.    This album is among only a handful of albums released during the last 10 years I rate, from start to finish, as being close to perfection.  If you want something more than a Johnny Cash compilation, this is the one to pick.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|while i, as many of the reviewers for this release, have every recording ever put forth by Rush, and have seen them live 9 times myself, did thoroughly enjoy this cd, from top to bottom. would i reccomend it to a non Rush afficianado? absolutely. would it crack the top ten of my Favorite Rush releases? give it some time. it is masterfully done, from the musicianship to the engineering. the songs are crisp and textured, the lyrics thought provoking, as with all of their previous releases. however, nothing really jumps out at you right away. it really takes some time, in my opinion, to let each track to soak in, and then ruminate, to really \\"get\\" this gem. the boys, as always, keep it tight musically, each diplaying his chops, and his musical input throughout. one fellow reviewer tags Counterparts as one of his favorite, and Test For Echo, as one of his least. flip flop that in my case. i really enjoyed Test For Echo, and \\"half the world\\" is one of my all time favorite tracks. Counterparts is maybe my least favorite Rush album. so you see, reading reviews and basing a decision is subjective. please listen to it for yourself. see what you think. then write a review and give your insight, and give others something to think about. enjoy.
0790729369|1.0|This movie endorses adultery to placate women suffering from boredom.

0812550757|5.0|Some fans have been disenchanted with the rest of the Ender series past the first book, but I would caution them not to lump this book in with the later ones simply because it shares a setting and a set of concerns. This one shines.<br /><br />This is the book Card actually had wanted to write for a long time-- the later ones were written because of his publisher's contract, and Ender's Game helped him finally establish a base from which to write Speaker for the Dead. I can understand why he'd always wanted to write this book: what is in it is beautiful and true. I couldn't and wouldn't say that for any of his books that followed, but this one deserves consideration independent of what you think of the rest of the series.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|I am always very skeptical about the big budget productions that exploit historical occurences using typical suspense and dramatic techniques, but somehow fincher's 'zodiac' succeeded brilliantly and is extremeley captivating proving that old formulas can still work providing that everything comes together and is thought out well...<br />First off the mood of the film is pitch perfect, coming into it you are expecting a blood and guts type film but you will soon realize that it is going to be a lot more sly and intelligent than that.. as fincher crafted a very careful character study which details this puzzle of a story..<br />Secondly, the acting is top notch almost reminding me of how directors like hitchcock, polanski, or coppola were able to get fresh and vibrant performances out of actors who you might think could just go on autopilot and collect their paycheck at the end without really caring..<br />The most important aspect of the movie, however, is how the historic timeline of the movie does not get in the way.. The film seems very true to its sources and yet it doesn't seem to sacrifice its own artifice for their sake (a mistake so many films of this genre make in my opinion)<br />So hats off to a truly chilling piece of work...

0553062182|5.0|I have read many, many, many self-help books, studied various theories, and as simple as Elaine Aron's concepts are, they are also life changing. I finally get it. I'm not strange or weird or unacceptable, I am simply more sensitive. I love the chapters on deciding life careers and the final chapters on celebrating the strengths of being highly sensitive. I did not agree with all of her analyses of love/romance for highly sensitve people. I think she was a bit too negative and missed out on some of the higher-level love/soulmate stuff that HSP can experience.  But this book is one I will be recommending to many people. Now I understand what it's like for my husband of 30 years, and I think I'll be better at explaining my needs to him. Read this book! I couldn't put it down.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Kansas has always had something of a bad rap. Art rock fans write them off as a pale American imitation of a chiefly British phenomenon; hard rock aficionados deride them for their high-flown pretensions; and the rest of the world tends to shy away from the band because of the \\"AOR\\" status they share with bands like Styx and Journey. For my part, I'm a staunch opponent of musical elitism - if it sounds good, who cares what genre it is, or who plays it? So hearing Kansas on the radio and delving deeper with a little help from YouTube, I decided to take the plunge and buy an album, namely LEFTOVERTURE (1976).    The album kicks off with a bang in the form of \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\", a record that you've probably heard a thousand times on classic rock radio and that might lead you to believe that the songs to follow will be in a similarly hard-rocking vein. But as LEFTOVERTURE progresses, it becomes increasingly evident that Kansas have their sights set somewhat higher. In fact, by the time the portentously titled closer \\"Magnum Opus\\" rolls around we've left the realm of hard rock entirely for the Land of Prog, where rivers run wild to the sound of frenetic keyboard solos and horses gallop in 13/8 and bad medieval metaphors abound. From the songs in-between it's clear that Kansas were very much influenced by the likes of Genesis (\\"Cheyenne Anthem\\") and Gentle Giant (\\"Miracles Out of Nowhere\\") and Yes (\\"Opus Insert\\"). But despite wearing its influences on its sleeve, the band has a unique sound of its own, due mostly to Robby Steinhardt's violin, his and Steve Walsh's highly distinctive voices, and Kerry Livgren's spiritually-infused songwriting.    I didn't know much about Kansas going into this album - I'd only heard a few songs on the radio and a few more on YouTube. In cases such as this, I usually opt for a \\"best of\\" package rather than a full album. But art rock seldom lends itself to compilation: hit singles tend to be uncharacteristic of a band's work as a whole,and anyway, most of them were album-oriented in the first place. Such is the case with Kansas. Because whether it's progressive rock, hard rock, arena rock, or something else entirely, is beside the point; Kansas is a good band, and LEFTOVERTURE a good - maybe even great - record. And that's what really matters.

6305882592|5.0|What can be said about Harold and Maude? Beautiful love story of two cosmic souls brought together by death. Hilarious black comedy with a heart of gold. I could think of more cliches but I digress.  Harold is a lonely lost young man, he stages suicides for his mother's benefit in a fruitless attempt for her attention. Upon attending a funeral he meets Maude, an elderly jovial woman so full of life she radiates happiness. Their friendship blossoms and Harold leans how to live instead of just existing. It is amazing how just one person could free him from his mental prison and realize that life is worth living.   Maude is really the muse of this film. Her philosophy is so clear and truthful that all the (explitive deleted) of the world just melts away and she is truly free. It is still is a very fun movie not heavy handed, just a pure delight.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|This review is about the HD DVD.  First off, the movie is excellent with adventure, great villains, intrigue, etc.  Acting and direction and special effects are all stellar.  Nolan delivered one great movie.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the Spider Man movies.  However, I think this one easily bests them in terms of all of the above.  Especially because it doesn't have the annoying Mary Jane!  :)<br /><br />The HD transfer is stellar.  Use this disk to show off the beauty of HD DVD.  Audio is great as well.<br /><br />So:<br />Movie:  5<br />HD Transfer:  5<br />Audio: 5<br /><br />This one is a winner.

0143038419|5.0|I adored this book, in all its imperfection.  She takes you with her on her journey of self-discovery, which is alternately poignant, inspiring, and laugh-out-loud funny, sometimes all in one paragraph.  My copy is dog-eared and underlined, and I have returned to it repeatedly when I've needed to remember how difficult experiences have so much to teach us.  My only critique, without giving anything away, is that the ending is a little \\"storybook\\" and in some ways undermines her message.  But it's also very hopeful for all of us who love a happy ending.

B00005JP5P|5.0|Hey.  You know, a lot of people will complain about the films \\"twist.\\"  But it actually is quite brilliant if you look beyond the surface.  This film is not for everyone, I could never get my grandfather to see it.  People nowadays go to films and veg, and they end up hating films that make them think.  This film has solid acting, very solid in fact, by the whole ensemble.  I mean, even Chris \\"the human torch\\" Evans was surprisingly very good.  The score is amazing, and artistically (visually) the film is unbelievable.  I won't ruin anything, but somethings happen that cause people to narrow their concept of the film.  But if they were to actually think, and comprehend the story that was unfolding--they would be amazed.  This film goes past the superficial--visual, etc.--and into the realm of \\"very deep-ness.\\"  *Small Spoilers*  Sunshine plays on multiple levels like philosophy as in death as a form of life, religion as in our right to choose to live, humanity as in--well--sacrifice.  It works on these very deep levels that--sadly--most films don't.  So, some will not be able to look past the surface and see the greatness of this film, some it will just take some time for them to see the meaning of this, and others, like me, will immediately be able to look past the surface and see the real film within the film.  I hope this helped.  Peace and Love    -Mike
B000BAQ8A0|4.0|The Rossini´s masterpiece Il Barbiere di Siviglia is brought to life again with elegancy and touch by the Madrid Opera in 2005, presenting two acclaimed singers of our time: Juan Diego Flórez and María Bayo. The staging is ingeniously effective all the way long, over all in the first scene, simulating Barbiere´s neighborhood. Costumes are not traditional but certainly a good match to the set. Madrid Orchestra and chorus are conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti with both passion and knowledge.  Juan Diego, -as he uses to do- gives both vitality and sensibility to Almaviva delivering a youthful and compromising singing and acting. A convincing Figaro is characterized by Pietro Spagnoli with an effortless singing and good understanding of the role. María Bayo is fabulous as Rosina hitting the difficulties of the partitura with easiness and wisdom. As Basilio we have the Italian extraordinary singing bass Ruggero Raimondi who owns the old school vocal technique, vast experience and still has his instrument in good shape making an outstanding accomplishment with this character. A very comic Bartolo is portrayed by Bruno Praticó who has lately taken a respectable position into this buffo repertoire due to his natural acting and singing skills. The secondary role of Bertha is magnified here with the talented Susana Cordón whose singing expressed a deep commitment and expressive bright.   The picture quality is very acceptable and the sound is incredible.   There are other \\"Barbiere\\" alternatives in DVD, for those who prefer a Mezzo in the Rosina role for instance, but this one definitely will not disappoint you.
141694740X|5.0|Awsome book! A must read for all ladies! Another besteller which I love and highly recommend - \\"How to be a Super Hot Woman: 339 Tips to Make Every Man Fall in Love with You and Every Woman Envy You\\" by Mandy Simons    Both books are amazing!
B0002O7XWC|5.0|I bought it because my brother was coming to visit and it was a big hit when we were kids.  I thought it would be a very pleasant \\"blast to the past\\" for the two of us.  The DVD was flawless and the movie is STILL and Classic.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Thought it started out kind of slow, but it gets interesting fast. I don't want to give away the plot developments, but you can see from the start that Hopkins is manipulating Gosling, and it bodes ill for the young prosecutor, who is used to winning his cases and gets torn between his desire to nail Hopkins and his high-paying dream job. There are some great twists and some difficult choices to be made by Gosling's character.<br /><br />I guessed how \\"it\\" was done halfway through, and my sis guessed how they would overcome a formidable legal hurdle, but it was still an enjoyable ride. Not a fast ride, but a simmering one.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is utterly enjoyable in all ways. It has the most clever dialouge, has the best directer in existence, and is quite humorous yet sophisticated. This movie is pure LOVE!
B0000024SI|5.0|I'd like to thank the present presidential administration for confirming the truth of the following lines:           Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unrolled a bedroll         Now tuba players rehearse around the flagpole         While the national bank at a profit sells roadmaps for the soul         To the old folks' home and the college.    Who needs a Constitution anyway?
0316172324|5.0|It took a long while for him to reference the author of one of my favorite books, but Gladwell does an excellent job (unintentionally?) on expanding Gavin Debeckers must read work, The Gift of Fear.  The idea that intuition is not mystery but science and that first impressions should (at times) be trusted above careful analysis is the bold margin notes I have written in both books.  There is a very good reason to trust your gut feelings.  Gladwell explores why we have them in the first place and how they can help us, get in our way, and most importantly how to tell the difference.<br /><br />Like DeBecker, Gladwell explains that intuition can be informed.  Out \\"guts\\" can be taught. Buying this book and spending some time in it would be a very good idea.
B0001WTWCO|4.0|The English Patient is my favorite movie, and I eagerly jumped on this special Collectors Edition when I found it.  I love the extras, my only complaint is that I would have loved a commentary track or just more special features including the actors.   I am an actress myself, and interested in the choices that Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes seemed to make so effortlessly.  Some commentary from them would give the extras here some balance (as it is, most of the commentary and extras are focused on the direction and writing.)    Either way, the movie is great and the extras aren't too bad.
032147404X|5.0|I found this book to be a great starting point for someone like myself...I've been interested in photography for quite some time, but had never ventured much beyond the simple Point and Shoot.  I had recently purchased a Canon 30D and felt I needed something to help me get some good shots and introduce me to the DSLR.<br /><br />I really like the format of the book, essentially a 1-2 pages dedicated to each subject, telling you exactly what you'd want to know if you're just getting started.  It had a number of great recommendations on products, tips, etc.<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much, I've already purchased this for other friends/family getting started with DSLR.  He's got a different sense of humor, however, I for one, actually enjoy it for a change of pace.<br /><br />I recently rented his other book: [[ASIN:0321330625 The Photoshop CS2 Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter)]]  I was looking for a book that would give me the details of how to post-edit my photos in Photoshop, this book provided me with a lot of good details and how-to's.<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this author.
B000003TAW|5.0|I have seriously listened to this album over 500 times in my short life of 22 years.  It's one of those cd's that can play from begining to end without getting on your nerves... while you sing (or play) along the whole way.  I would compare this quality to Dark Side of the Moon....   I wish artists would go back to making albums, not just songs.  This album has soul.  not traditional soul... but soul all the same.
B0001GMIOE|1.0|I originally purchased one of these batteries as an extra for my Canon 30D.  However, after receiving it, a professional photography recommended getting non-branded version from a different website.  The price of those non-branded versions was $8 each, I returned this and ordered 5 of the others for the same price as one of the Canon's.  The non-branded batteries have been working just great.<br /><br />This is one case where I personally chose to skip the Canon brand...most everything else I have is Canon branded.
0375707972|5.0|This is one of the most profound novels I've read in years.  A complex and stunning work that leaves one deeply moved by it's incredible way of presenting questions regarding moral responsibility, guilt, and the nature of love.  Schlink is a German writer who grew up confronted by these issues and he is one of the truly gifted novelists of our time.  I could not put this book down and found it haunting, richly drawn, and brilliantly written.

B000EWBKKI|3.0|There's little reason to grab this over the standard DVD version. The transfer is fuzzy and details are not particularly sharp; granted, it's from 1992 and wasn't exactly filmed in HD to begin with, but I was expecting more out of it than this. The extras treatment is very bare bones, repeating the same commentaries from before and adding little in the way of additional materials. Fortunately it's cheap, but don't expect much.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|I just saw the basic version that comes from Netflix, but I understand the versions are basically the same except for some added material on the 2-disk. This is where the review action seems to be, anyway.<br /><br />It's a blast! Great effects - well, I know that's expected nowadays, but even so - and I like that del Toro keeps CGI in its place, preferring \\"live\\" action when it's possible. (That was a strength of his \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", too).<br /><br />I'm not much of a comic book guy, but I recognise the sharp and sassy tone of the dialog. You have to chuckle when some absolutely appalling thing happens, Hellboy's plans going horribly awry, perhaps the end of him or indeed the world, and his comment is \\"Oh, crap.\\" In fact, as the monster with so many human failings and feelings, he reminds me of Grendel as interpreted by John Gardner in his marvellous book. The difference is that Grendel can't help attacking/eating humans, while Hellboy wants to save them.<br /><br />So overall, just enjoy for an undemanding and never-boring experience. Appreciate the skill with which del Toro \\"places\\" you in just the right relation to the story, the mood, and the characters, so that while you never take it seriously, you never think \\"oh, just too silly\\" as one may do with inferior fantasy.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|Another masterful season of \\"Lost\\" has come to a crashing, and enigmatic end.  For fans (like me) drawn to the show's thrills and riddles, Season 3 didn't disappoint.  Like Season 2, you can't just get into the show, but \\"Lost\\" more than rewards those who can start from the beginning.    ARE YOU LOST:  \\"Lost\\" follows the trauma-filled lives and back-stories of the survivors of Oceanic Ft. 815, which crashed on a mysterious island enroute from Sydney to LA.  As time passed, and hopes for an immediate rescue dimmed, the survivors realized that they would have to come to terms with their new home, even as (we see in flashbacks) none have proved capable of coming to terms with their flawed lives.  We met jack Shepard, a doctor obsessed with fixing whatever's broken, except for his own family.  We also met Sawyer, the conman and heroic anti-hero.  Kate is the woman between the two of them, a criminal on the run for murder.  Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is a man with a long and complicated past - one that crippled him physically as well as emotionally, until he came to the Island, and found himself mysteriously bonded to it.    Then there are The Others.  Hinted at until the end of the 1st season, we find by the end of Season 2 that the others inhabit an organized commune on the island.  Their purpose and the bizarre strains of their society are slowly pealed away like an onion.  At the climax, the Others blackmailed Michael into helping them kidnap Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley.  (Hurley was released with orders to warn the rest of the survivors to keep away from their half of the island.)  Who are the others, and what is their connection to the shadowy \\"Dharma Initiative\\"?  And what about \\"Fake Henry Gale\\"?  Revealing himself as Ben Linus doesn't quite begin to explain his knotty soul - Ben proves to be as trustworthy, a politician of sorts adept at using fear and hatred to manipulate others.  (For politically minded viewers, the opening scene of Season 3 will raise disturbingparallels with 9/11, and its principal players.)  But in the end, the Others are perfectly drawn because, like the Island, they have a perfectly maintained air of mystery.    In Season 3, Jack must confront the others, find out why he was singled out, and maneuver between them to get Sawyer and Kate to safety.  New characters get the Lost treatment, with flashback episodes for Ben, Desmond (the crazy guy found by Locke in The Hatch) and Juliet, a doctor among the others used by Ben to manipulate Jack.  We see Locke struggle through a crisis of faith over the island, while Hurley attempts to defeat \\"the numbers curse\\" (another great Hurley episode).  Returned to the good graces of Claire, Charlie learns that he is marked for a grim fate.  These and many other character plot twists abound in Season 3, as \\"Lost\\" shows that it's lost none of its momentum.  The inertia continues right up to the end of the season finale, which has all the thrills and mystery of the rest of the season and something that the other shows don't - a flash-forward.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I am in my thirties, so when I was a kid Superman was one of the main cartoons on TV and these comics were available everywhere. Throughout the years there have been many movies and series about this beloved superhero, but I am not aware of any that tackled Superman's life as a teenager. Therefore, \\"Smallville\\" fills a gap that fans everywhere love to finally see bridged. In this series we find answers to many questions about Superman, from why kryptonite weakens him to why Lex Luthor was a villain.<br /><br />In 1989 a meteorite storm hit Smallville, Kansas, killing many people, but bringing joy to a couple of farmers that were not able to have kids. The Kents find a small boy near a strange artifact, or maybe it was the boy that found them. They soon realize that this boy is different from other kids, and what a big difference it is! He has unbelievable strength and speed, and that is just the beginning. But not only the Kents saw their life change on that day in 1989, since Lex Luthor was visiting Smallville with his father and the shock of witnessing the meteorite shower left him bald for life.<br /><br />The connection between Lex and Clark was established at that first moment, but it is not until years later that they \\"meet\\". If that is what you would call Lex unintentionally running over Clark with his car and ending up in a lake from which he has to be rescued by the super teenager. Lex does not remember very well what happened, but he has suspicions; nevertheless, they become very good friends.<br /><br />Clark is different from other teenagers, but he feels exactly like every other one of them. He is in love with Lana Lang, the girlfriend of the quarterback of the high school's football team. Therefore, he wants to play football himself and upon his parents objections he promises not to use his \\"natural advantage\\" in the field. Of course, there are many other situations along these lines throughout the season.<br /><br />The story has a nice balance between the action and the constant development of the personal stories of the main characters. Also, the meteor shower had a myriad of secondary effects on many people, so we see villains with strange powers surface episode after episode and Clark Kent battling them.<br /><br />On top of the appeal from the plot's perspective and the background information on the most famous superhero of all time, the series counts with very good actors. Tom Welling is the best Superman I have seen among all the series and movies, and Michael Rosenbaum is absolutely perfect in the role of Lex Luthor. Most of the other members of the cast do not lag far behind.<br /><br />This is a must see series for anyone that has ever been interested in Superman. For the people that have been disappointed by previous experiences regarding movies or series featuring this superhero, I can only say that this effort surpasses them all and that you may be pleasantly surprised if you give it one more try. Enjoy!velopment of the personal stories of the main characters.

B00003CXZ4|2.0|I like the people in this movie and mostly the pretty girl with the dark hairs.  I don't quiet understanding why the man has tatoos, however.  Sometimes he rubs them, and sometimes they are in big letters, like, DON'T ANSWER PHONES!!!! Does he have a tattoo-making friend who owes money to the phone company?  I couldn't tell.  Also, why does the bald man come so much to the hotel rooms?  Does he work for the phone companies maybe?  Also the girl was pretty but was in dark places many times - does she have the light burning problem?  Maybe she is a witch and explodes in the daytimes!!  Can someone please explain?  I like the man in the room but he should try markings other than words; he is not a piece of paper!!  Maybe that's why he keeps going to same places again!!  My questions make two stars for the nice people, but answers give three more tomorrow!!!
0007247087|5.0|This is an amazing book. If you think your life is hard, read this book.  What is interesting is that his life (before it all changed) wasn't much different than that of a boy in the US -- listening to Run-DMC, learning to rap and dance... his divorced parents.  By contrast, his struggles during the war are surreal and painful to experience through his words.  The writing style is plain and clear, but able to convey subtle emotion as well as the absence of emotion that comes with needing to survive through a litany of painful experiences. Just the fact that he can tell the story of who he became to survive shows tremendous courage that few could equal.
B00004THAY|4.0|Good CD, the first track is different that the rest of the album which is more of the BBking style than classic Clapton.
B000VNMMQ6|3.0|If your old enough, then you may well pine for the 80's. When action heroes were more superhuman (Arnold) more politically incorrect (Sly) and a damn site more resourceful and less dependent on CGI. Thus 'Die Hard 4' is a wonderful, care free throwback for all the right reasons.     And you'd better believe that Bruce Willis is the Man. He puts virtually all actors in their 20's and 30's to shame reprising his signature role as John McClane. Can any of the Generation Y metrosexual cream puffs hold a candle to Bruce for sheer tough guy charisma and action hero chops? Add to that his considerable comic skill and a hint of vunerability and you've got what's so sorely missing from today's wannabe's.     This film is easily the summer's most entertaining suprise and pleasure. Fast paced furious fun thats sticks to the basics: Likable characters, humour, plenty of action and the typical 'Die Hard' ticking clock plot. But it's the cast that makes this cook: Bruce has great chemistry with nerdy Justin Long, their banter is terrific. There's a pair of svelte villains in Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q, who is one bodacious butt kicking villainess. And Kevin Smith puts in a damn fine cameo.     Director Len Wiseman propels things along a bit choppily but efficiently, only going OTT with a somewhat 'True Lies'-ish freeway chase with a fighter jet. And the grainy, bleached look had moi nostalgic for the deep, luscious magic hour panavison hues supplied by Jan De Bont in the classic 1989 original-but why carp?     'Die hard 4' is very entertaining 80's action pic retooled for today's audience. And it benefits immeasurably from Bruce Willis' effortlessly strong screen presence. 'Die Hard 5'? Yes please.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Just giving a heads, one of the things i wanted to know is if the fake movie trailers would be on the dvd, so once i found out on Movieweb I figured I'd pass it along, nor will they be on the Planet Terror dvd. I was looking forward to Eli Roth's fake trailer for the horror film Thanksgiving.    I personally don't mind that there not being released together and am looking forward to purchasing both movies, although obviously it would be nice to get both together.    Death Proof is one of the best of 2007 so far.  It is another cool, original and stylish film from Quentin Tarantino.  A cross between a slasher movie where a car is used in place of a knife and an action movie with a chase scene that would rival The French Connection.  Keep an eye on Vanessa Ferlito the actress that plays butterfly, watch for the lap dance scene.  She has a real original look.  Also Zoe Bell the stuntwoman in real life who worked on the Tarantino's Kill Bill movies, who now is making her acting debut as what else, a bad blank stuntwoman, and she does her own stunts, she performs one, if not the best car chase scene I've seen in a movie.    Special features:  *) Never-before-seen footage including the \\"missing reel\\" (containing Vanessa Ferlito's unseen lap-dance sequence) as well as a black-and-white segment in the film's second act  *) Finding Quentin's Gals featurette  *) The Guys of Death Proof featurette  *) Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike featurette  *) Introducing Zoe Bell featurette  *) Quentin's Greatest Collaborator: Editor Sally Menke featurette  *) Trailer for Double Dare  *) International poster gallery
B0001AP12G|3.0|Don't really know what all runs through Kanye's head, but he has a habit of speaking out in places he shouldn't about stuff he doesn't know anything about.  Furthermore he spends half this record touting how good he is, claiming to be such a prolific rapper, but never putting out anything that great.  Half his producing is the that stupid high pitch voice moaning in the background, which grinds my nerves.  I don't see the creativity in this album, and I was wanting to like Kanye's music regardless of how big an idiot I think he is, but I came out disappointed.
B000002UA5|1.0|The best thing I can say about this part-live, part-studio garbage is that it is best served on a hippie platter with all the \\"space-rock\\" and animal noises one can tolerate.  The band at its absolute worst.  The only good songs, if there are any, are the live version of Astronomy Domine and maybe Grantchester Meadows.  Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together In A Cave And Grooving With A Pict is not even a song, but a bunch of f---ing animal noise.  Roger Waters is not even singing, he is whispering in the midst of all those furry creatures making all that racket that it is hard to hear a f---ing word he is saying.  The rest of the tracks except for the good ones I mentioned above are just as disappointing.  Careful With That Axe, Eugene, A Saucerful Of Secrets, and Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun are some of the worst tracks Pink Floyd has ever recorded and why they should be included in a live set is beyond my comprehension.  Don't even waste your money or your time on this crap.  It is nothing but a piece of shoddy musicianship by an otherwise great band.

B000R8YC1S|4.0|Labyrinth is somthing that was my life blood for many years.  I have the original release of the DVD and didn't bother getting any of the more recent collector edition or fancy dvds that came out recently so I can't compare to those.<br /><br />The movie is the same, but much higher qualitiy, you can really see all of the glitter that sparkles all over the labyrinth, its wide screened so you can see that much more of the world (and the elusive treasures in Sarah's room, aka the Goblin King doll).<br /><br />The DVD is in a slip case, which has a holographic type cover (oh yes, its that cool).  The first DVD has the movie along with a track of commentary by Brian Froud.  Having listened to it I found it pretty interesting, since he was involved in the entire creative process he had a lot of background information on how certain things came about, though sadly no on set anicdotes (except for a few which are related to Toby)  since he didn't witness alot of the filming.  It would have been nice to have another track with some of the muppeteers, Brian Henson, Kevin Clash, Karen Prell etc.<br /><br />The second disc has the old documentary on the making of the movie, which was on the previous DVDs.  It also has 2 new documentaries.  Both have interviews (new) with Froud (Brian and Toby) Gates McFadden, Brian Henson (very insightful), Karen Prell, Dave Goelz, George Lucas (very interesting, I was surprised he did this actually)  and several others that were involved in the making of the movie.  With in these new features there are some new behind the scenes footage, screen tests, but what I was really dissapointed in...In the MirrorMask coffee table book it was mentioned how Neil Gaimen and Dave McKean mentioned how when staying in Jim Henson's home in England they found a nearly six hour version of the Labyrinth and used it as a sort of spring board for their own creative process.  I wanted to see some of that six hours, to see some cut scenes, extended scenes, outtakes.  It sounded when the press release for this first came out that it would have some of that in it...sadly no.<br /><br />But it is still enjoyable enough to get. Besides every home should have a copy of this movie (or three like mine does)ess release for this first came out that it would have some of that in it...sadly no.    But it is still enjoyable enough to get. Besides every home should have a copy of this movie (or three like mine does)
B0000035E7|4.0|Bleach is overall not an exceptionally well written album. There are many songs on here that if written later probably would have been B sides. The one big sound Nirvana tends to portray is more of a metalish sound clearly inspired by his friends and fellow Aberdeen residents The Melvins. Probably the best way to divide this album is the songs with little metal influence and the ones with a lot of it. The ones with not much are Blew, About A Girl, School, Love Buzz, and Downer. These songs are all among the best on the album, showcasing Nirvana's later winning formula of dissonant, hooky anthems. Overall, what could be said about these could largely be said for Nevermind.    Then there are the other 8 songs on the album. Among those, the best songs are Paper Cuts and Negative Creep hands down. One of the biggest problems with the remainder of the songs is that they are all bunched up together and they all have rather long running time. By the time you get to the second half of Sifting, you will be asking yourself when this will end. Whether the large amounts of metal songs on this album is due to pressure Jon Poneman put on the band is still heavily disputed, and I don't know all too much about it, but how they basically tried to frontload all the non-metal songs and after that went what is often considered the best metal songs would definitely give one a hint that the band themselves really didn't like much of these songs.    In all respect, for a debut album, and an album that you don't really (or at least percieve yourself to) have much creative control over this one is very good. There are really some winning songs on here, and even the worst songs on the album aren't really too bad at all; I suppose the main thing that throws off this review from 5 stars is that not only are some songs much better than others, the band basically admits they are better by frontloading them.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|I've been watching Patton about every other year since I was a child and have to say that the movie never gets old. As far as performances go, George C. Scott exceeds all expectations in this role. You get the feeling while watching him that the actor indeed thought he was his character during his time on the set. His Patton is the epitome of passion, desire, will, and honor. Of course, true to life, he was a complicated figure and the film displays this aspect of the man as well. He was vainglorious and rash--attributes often expected, and forgivable in a general. Scott's impressive but so is the script. One of the nice things about this DVD is that Francis Ford Coppola gives a short intro in which he shares that he was the screenplay writer and also fleshes out a few circumstances around the making of The Godfather. His perspective adds to one's appreciation of the film. Patton also has some great action scenes such as the initial battle in the desert against, who he thought was, Rommel. The German General Staff scenes are speculative but unquestionably entertaining. I find Patton to be a fun and noble flick.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|I was the first and only of my friends to see this movie...it was okay I guess, I only really cared for ONE of the actors, Jay, who played Paxton. Other than him I really did not care for anyone else. the first time I saw this (when it was in theatres) I thought it was great, but then again...I thought EVERYTHING was great haha Back then I'd get pissed and most of the time juset watch a super gory, blood-spilling, movie to get my anger out so every movie I saw with tons of blood, I'd say it's good. But I agree with one of the people who wrote a review, SOOO MANY DUMMIES THAT IF U LOOK CLOSE AT, LOOK VERYYY FAKE!!! This movie is okay and is a movie that SHOULD of come straight to DVD and should of been in the $3.99 box at walmart or something, it's worth a watch, not a buy.
B00005R2IS|5.0|To his feral state. Yes, I'm aware of the feral child character in Road Warrior but in Mad Max we see the beginning of this imagined society's serious decline. It's rather humorous that a film that seems so low budget to us today can be as entertaining and riveting as this one is. Watching this now, for the fourth or fifth time, I have to say that this very young Mel Gibson, did he not already possess a legitimate level of talent, would not have been so believable in this role due to his physical appearance. His polish and chiseled features really don't fit in amid the band of miscreants that is the cast, but we soon forget our initial impressions due to his performance. The people in Mad Max are far closer to man's actual state than most of us care to admit. The audience can completely relate to Max's reaction at the end of the film and we cheer for him and long to press our feet even more heavily upon the accelerator.

B000N3ST9I|2.0|I bought the last Machine Head album and I ended up selling it because it just wasn't good.    Then the Blackening came out and I heard some of it at my local guitar shop and the guys were saying \\"this is the best CD ever\\".  Then I read somewhere that this is \\"The best metal album of all time\\".  So naturally I had to get myself a copy.    All I can say is this album is NOT the best metal album ever.  It's very typical and generic all the way through.  There are some shinning moments, but don't run out to buy it, it's not worth the hype.    The first song, Halo, and Wolves are pretty good songs.  The rest of the album is the definition of mediocrity.  Bottom line, there's nothing new here.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|If you liked the original, you'll definitely like this new concert on DVD. Contains performances of the best songs from the original plus about 15 new songs. The stage/backdrop is much better - most famous Irish castle vs. indoor venue. Haley, the new singer from New Zealand, is a great compliment to the all-Irish cast of excellent voices.
B000089RVR|4.0|I really am enjoying this CD Life for Rent. The title song \\"White Flag\\" I believe was written by the artist and is my favorite song. Honest lyrics and a full rich voice.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I loved this movie as a child and now my 1 1/2 year old daughter loves it -- especially &#34;Hard Knock Life.&#34;  The acting, singing and dancing are superb -- and the orphans are all so adorable and talented.  Aileen Quinn made the perfect Annie -- all the other Annie movies following her just do not cut it!  I've now seen or heard all the Annie's (all the movies and Broadway soundtracks) and I remain amazed by the talented Aileen Quinn.  Just as no one could be a better Maria than Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music, no one can ever be a better Annie than Quinn!!!
B00005JKG9|4.0|I could say too much about this film, but I'll keep it brief: if you've never seen this film, you owe it to yourself to see it.  This is David Mamet at his best, with some of the most memorable, profanity-laced dialogue in the English language.  A friend of mine and I used to carry on conversations using at least 50% lines from Glengarry Glen Ross (in jest, thank God.)  It's razor-sharp writing, a good story, and a stark commentary on the dog-eat-dog world of sales (and perhaps by extension, capitalism itself.)  But on top of that, this film also features some of the best performances you will ever see from Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, even Jonathan Pryce shines as the timid sucker hustled by Ricky Roma.  This is an actor's movie, no doubt.  There are only a couple reasons I didn't give this five stars.  Firstly, the direction and cinematography are hardly inspired.  They kind of don't even need to be; in most films that'd matter a lot, but in this case the writing and acting are what makes it so great, so it's really not a problem for these otherwise essential ingredients to just get out of the way of what makes the film so enjoyable.  The real disappointment for me was the lack of extras on this so-called special edition DVD.  I won't go into details, as I know others have, but suffice it to say you should expect nothing \\"special.\\"  Despite those shortcomings, this is an awesome movie and certainly one of my favorites.  It bears many repeated viewings.  Get it, or hit the bricks, pal.

0441013074|4.0|Another solid story and set of characters from Mr. Reynolds, and well worth your time if you are a fan.<br /><br />If you have not read Alastair Reynolds yet, I would recommend PUSHING ICE first and then this book; together the two will give you a good feel for the strengths...and weaknesses of his writing.<br /><br />Strengths of CENTURY RAIN:<br />1. Story is engaging, main characters are well-developed<br />2. Just the right amount of technology and scientific reality<br />3. No deux ex machina solution<br />4. Fascinating settings that leave you wanting to read more about them<br />5. Secondary characters are interesting in their own right<br /><br />Weaknesses of CENTURY RAIN:<br />1. Ending is a bit too neatly tied up in parts<br />2. The key to the mystery was fairly obvious about 3/4 of the way through<br /><br />Thus, I score it a high 4, not a 5, but more than enough to keep me waiting for the next novel by Reynolds.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this set before our driving trip from Chicago to South Carolina. My three school-aged boys watched two DVDs driving south and two driving north. They absolutely loved them, lots of ooohing and aaaaahing and laughing from the back seats. I loved that they were getting away from typical cartoon or potty humor movies and actually learning things, they just found all the DVDs a load of fun.
0446677450|5.0|This is a great book that shows the importance of gaining a financial education, which is something that most of us have neglected to pursue. It challenges the \\"go-to-school-and-get-a-good-job\\" mentality that modern society and the educational system has taught us is the best way to financial freedom. It offers some fundamental lessons about money that will change the way you look at investing.     I have read most of the books in the Rich Dad series and they are all excellent. They have so inspired me that I have made a personal commitment to get out of the \\"rat race\\". I am documenting this journey to financial freedom on my blogspot:     [...]

B000IJ79WU|2.0|Okay, I waited for a long while before writing this because I just didn't want to admit just how disappointed I was with the results. I was \\"one of those people\\" who wrote in to Warner asking for the Donner Cut to be finally released. They listened, but not carefully enough I guess. Michael Thau said that he knew what fans wanted and were looking for in a Donner Cut. If only this was the truth, but I guess perception is reality. The final film result should be considered a bonus disc to a film that never existed and probably will never exist. After careful consideration, I personally would have preferred more of a hybrid of Lester's and Donner's version. The title of this review refers to Gene Hackman's line when he walks into the Daily Planet. This was a Donner scene, and one of Luther's funniest quips when he said \\"With all of this accumulated knowledge,when will these dummies learn to use the door knob.\\" For some reason, Mr. Thau felt the need to cut this memorable line out of the Donner cut altogether. What was he thinking? Also my favorite, very, emotional scene with Margot Kidder, when Superman breaks up with her before he destroys the Fortress of Solitude, was cut practically in half. The best lines, which in my VHS version are spoken very,very clearly by Margot Kidder about the their relationship being like \\"the Eternal Triangle,\\" and how she has \\"All of humanity waiting in the next room,\\" were cut out. The same happened with the follow-up scene on her balcony. Very little of those scenes were left in by Mr. Thau. What was left in, was voiced over by some other woman-very poorly.     The editing is extremely choppy, even amateurish looking, which many other reviewers also complained about. The optical effects were also so-so, not even in par with the original 1980 effects in Lester's version. A very sad indication that this project was not given the budget it deserved. This is obvious in the turning back the world sequence and a very bad shot of Ursula flying through the night sky with her head so out of scale with the rest of her body that she looked like a flying \\"bobble head\\" doll.    I guess that's it. I just wish that with all the information that Warner and Mr. Thau had, knowing what the fans wanted, that they could have delivered something much, much better than this.

B000R7I3LY|4.0|This young woman has a powerful, dynamic voice. Her sound comes close to the sound you might hear on a pop radio station, but well-thought, meaningful lyrics and top-notch arrangements keep her clear of the trap of being \\"just pop\\". A very enjoyable effort overall.

B000N4SADC|5.0|No doubt about it, this quartet has some kind of mastery of time, as implied by the title. Weaving through complex time signatures and changes as facilely and easily as most people cross the street, this album is by turns stark, startling, and lush. It's full of hidden and pleasant surprises. Fuze's expansive array of effects pedals is used very tastefully in this effort and adds a great deal of timbral range to the album.    A must-have for anyone who enjoys music that takes you weird and compelling places.
1582701709|4.0|Don't get me wrong. I am thrilled that The Secret has helped people all around the world realize that our thoughts DO have power, and that our beliefs and attitudes DO influence what we manifest in our lives. That's an important first step in understanding how to create a life that is more joyful and fulfilling. However, there is much more to the manifestation process than is mentioned in this book. For example: The Secret tells you over and over again that through positive thinking you will \\"attract what you want to you.\\" But the fact is, rarely do you literally attract what you want to you. What you DO attract are the people, circumstances, and opportunities that LEAD YOU to what you want. In other words, when you utilize the principles mentioned in The Secret, doors open. But you have to RECOGNIZE those doors for what they are, and then GO THROUGH THEM. And that involves TAKING ACTION. The \\"real secret\\" to manifesting what you want to have, do, or be in life is being open and receptive to the many subtle ways that the Universe (or God) guides you forward, and then being willing to take the steps that you are being divinely directed to take. If that point was mentioned more than just once in The Secret, I might have been inclined to give it a higher rating.<br /><br />Steven Lane Taylor, author of Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow
B000QQFKYE|4.0|With Inland Empire, (and I must add Mulholland Drive too), David Lynch, I suspect, has begun to turn inward, most likely mirroring the bizarre twisted view he has of Hollywood. He shows the Hollywood sign almost right away. I am sure to some extent he sees this word on a day to day basis, meeting big phony types, muscle with money, burnt out old stars, pretty boys, nymphs, foreigners, empty sound stages, lame lunch meetings, half baked projects, empty mansions with nothing going on, and all the horrid, strange people met and absorbed on that filthy rich littered landscape. Take all this, and twist it up, pull it, heat it, and mirror it upon itself, upside down and backwards through the Lynch mind and you have Inland Empire.<br /><br />To say it was either good or bad would be doing the film an injustice. David Lynch's films have become so enigmatic, this one in particular, that to give a yay or nay nod to the film would be to feign some sort of rudimentary understanding of it. I suspect Lynch himself knows no more what he is doing than any of us do, say, when we are asleep, deep in dreams, floating in the abyss of our minds collective soup. This is not a bad thing it's just become surrealism, pure and simple. This is a surrealist film. It cannot be judged as most films are. It stands, pretty much, outside the scope of what I mostly see. I enjoy the change I assure you. Yet the film does not register with me as most films do. This film floats.<br /><br />One part even seems culled from an old Abbot & Costello routine with Irons telling Bucky to move it down while Bucky comically moves it up.<br /><br />Other parts, with actors from his other films seem almost as if they have spilled right out of those Lynch movies as real/imagined actors moving on to appear in Inland Empire, as fictional versions of themselves. The recognizable faces such as Dern & Irons only help to remind me I am watching a made up film. I found it hard to lose myself in this. This is often the case with recognizable talent where little or nothing is done to make their People Magazine, normal, every day faces look different.  I suspect this was intentional. Still anyone's guess is as good as mine. Lynch has just become so esoteric that reviewing this film on acid would probably get one better results.<br /><br />It's worth seeing, and more than once for sure. Is it worth loving? For me, the verdict is still out. Sometimes films need a few decades to cook in my mind before they gel into something my unconscious starts to desire all on its own.lent where little or nothing is done to make their People Magazine, normal, every day faces look different.

6305736650|5.0|At 55 years of age, you'd think a movie lover such as myself would have seen Casablanca... but I hadn't until I bought this disc in July of 2007. If you understand what makes a finely crafted film that you can watch repeatedly and still continue to find things out about it that you love, this is one you'll enjoy immensely.<br /><br />Start with the script - it is filled with tasty classic lines you'll really delight in hearing in the context of the film. \\"Here's looking at you, Kid...\\" for example. Part of what makes all of it work is the vocal treatment by the actors in their delivery. The cast seems very comfortable with the characters they each play, and so maybe that relaxed feel carries over to the degree of realism you sense when you watch it. Their dialogue does NOT seem scripted and that's hard to achieve on a consistent basis in a film. I suppose that's a big part of what's made Casablanca such a classic to all who have reviewed the work over the years.<br /><br />The acting is superb across the board regardless of how small the part. Ingrid Bergman is luminescent to put it mildly. Bogie is really a powerhouse in this one, and Paul Henreid as well as Claude Rains deliver the kind of intimately detailed performances that just make you smile while you watch. Peter Lorre has a smaller part but exquisitely crafted in its execution. He makes it easy for you to hate him, let's put it that way. Sydney Greenstreet gives a solid presentation as well to round out the core ensemble performances given here.<br /><br />The special features on this disc include a very nice introduction by Lauren Bacall, Bogart's widow. I watched it AFTER viewing the film as I wanted to get the same feel as audiences who originally viewed it in the theater, but I wish I had watched it first. Enlightening to say the least.<br /><br />Another little gem is a series of trailers for Bogie's other movies. Great slices of the period as far as movie promotion goes! They serve as great reminders of a simpler time in America.<br /><br />This particular film is a MUST HAVE for anyone's movie collection. I feel that repeated viewings year on year will only make you love it more than you did the first time. Not many films are able to do that.<br /><br />I can safely say that if you, too, love truly great movies and you decide to purchase this one, it will be the start of a beautiful friendship.This particular film is a MUST HAVE for anyone's movie collection.

0060763892|5.0|This book was my favorite of all of Rollins' Sigma Force novels. James Rollins has never disappointed me with any of his books, this one was different though. I loved the constant action and up and down story line. As always when I complete one of his books, I am in a research frenzy. I love to research his own research because his books leave you with the question..\\"Holy Crap! Is that really true?\\". The facts in this book left me covered in goosebumps. Rollins does a tremendous job of intertwining fact with fiction. He is a master story teller in a day and age where authors do not seem to care about researching before they write. I am left in awe of his ability.
0375831002|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book.    I don't say that often (in fact, this is the first book that I have ever said this about in a review), especially as I read 20 books/month on average.  This book is simply that good.    It is well written in simple language that never comes across as simplistic.  Zusak encourages his reader to question their own beliefs and feelings on love, loss, family, life, and death without ever coming across as preachy or trite.  He doesn't play games with the reader's head for shock value.  It's a good story told in an exceptionally well-presented fashion.     The story itself is narrated by Death, which, oddly, is not anywhere near as depressing as it sounds.  It deals with difficult topics in a way that that both adults and young-adults can relate to.    It took me about four hours to read it cover to cover, and I immediately re-read it, just in case I missed something the first time.  I wanted to take my time and savor it.  I enjoyed it just as much the second time around.    Since I purchased it in May, I have read \\"The Book Thief\\" three times.  This book is quickly becoming an old friend.    I have since purchased a second copy of this book, and I have lent it to numerous friends, ALL of whom have gone on to buy their own copies and recommend it to their friends.
B000001EGA|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Elton John released this album in 1975, and regarding it was a shocking change, this albums represents the most beautifully versatile and light popcraft Elton John ever released, possessing the most personal and thoughtful conceptual set of songs. Keeping a structure of delightful pop with an elegant soft rock, this albums remains as one of my greatest favorites, specially because of how comprehensive and light the composition of each track is done. Elton John goes personal in this album, and if you are going to talk about your and your bandmates' history, isn't that a precise formula for spectacular concentration and fearful effort? It all starts with the title song, a joyful conceptual song, which spins around Davey's acoustic guitar, about Elton and Taupin early beginnings. The dramatically humourous Tower Of Babel surely will put a smile in the listener's face, or the catchy, mellodic tune in Bitter Fingers with its delightful electric piano light introduction and faded electric guitar. The urban selective sound in Tell Me When The Whistle Blows, its a remarkable highlight. But after all here is one of my long time favorites from among pop genre, Someone Saved My Life Tonight, with its majestic instrumentation and the fragile emotion in the song will keep a soul calm from the start to the end. The rock and roll sound of (Gotta Get A) Meal Ticket, the short but joyful, serene Better Off Dead and the country flavoured but delicate and conceptual Writting are awesome, even when they stand a little bit like interlude songs the instrumentation and the mellodies are explosive. Going through the end, We All Fall In Love Sometimes is one of my favorite balladry songs, specially because of the fact that almost any song with harpischord and specially A.R.P. synthesizer sounds like heaven to me, later connecting with Curtains, a light balladry full of emotions, a very beautiful composition, although I think is made too long. Among the bonus tracks, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is maybe the greatest interpretation of this song, and One Day At A Time is another wonderful interpretation. Even just looking at the artwork is recognized the imagery, creativity and fantastic compositions concentrated in this album, the front cover is one of my favorites. Captain Fantastic focuses on a fantastic light popcraft comprehensible and notorious to any listener, I recommend it to anyone with inclinnations toward uncompromising, beautiful music.In The Sky With Diamonds is maybe the greatest interpretation of this song, and One Day At A Time is another wonderful interpretation.

B00064WSN2|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - After their stunning and critically acclaimed debut, King Crimson decides to continue with this original style that was leaving everyone impressed. The style and composition of this album is surely noticed to have a great amount of inspiration from In The Court Of The Crimson King, I would even call it as a continue, and the last one with the beloved singer Greg Lake.<br /><br />Even after the great success of the debut album, it was obvious that their music didn't fit in everyone's heads, and even with the most positive critics, it stood on the album charts as #23. In The Wake Of Poseidon is much the same history; very positive critics, amazing music and almost the same chart position (#35), but its just so nice to hear it, every track is worth and you'll be very familiarized with the sounds and moods of the debut album.<br /><br />Apart from the fact of being closely related to the debut album, this album is just perfect in every way; the composition is very original and well thought, the instruments are played in an incredibly sofisticated way, and the moods that dominate the album are improvisational, pure, mature, soft, calm, just beautiful. It's also a principal source of musical evaluation when it comes to comparing it with other KC albums like the heavy and mature compositions in the debut album, the jazzy style and soft debilities later shown in Lizard, the much more shown inclination to improvisation shown in every other album with much more devotion (specially Starless And Bible Black) and the soft and calm moods that I compare a lot with Islands. King Crimson was definitively making themselves a way of cultural following and complex understanding.<br /><br />The songs are all unique in their own special way: the three fragments of Peace would be a reference to King Crimson devotion of breaking songs into little fragments (just like fragemnts of Larks Tongues In Aspic and The Power To Believe). The heavy jazz in Picture Of A City and little jazz arrengemets in Cat Food (my favorite in the album) marks a trace of an interest of new styles and the mix of genres to produce spectacular results just like in songs like Lady Of The Dancing Water (Lizard), Lament (Starless And Bible Black) and The Letters (Islands). The powerful and poetical pieces demonstrated in In The Wake Of Poseidon (shown before like in the songs Epitaph and The Court Of The Crimson King). Finally the soft and calm moods that can catch by surprise with heavy instrumentation such as Peace and Cadence And Cascade.<br /><br />In conclussion this album is just another incredible success, original sounds and very well thought composition. I recall it as their second best album. Critical for every prog or KC fan to listen to it, but if you may want something far away from the debut album you might not find it so attractive.n Cat Food (my favorite in the album) marks a trace of an interest of new styles and the mix of genres to produce spectacular results just like in songs like Lady Of The Dancing Water (Lizard), Lament (Starless And Bible Black) and The Letters (Islands).

B0002UOK04|5.0|This album is, as of right now, my favorite album of all time, why? Because it's original, beautiful, yet dark and heavy, and its just plain enjoyable.  Wintersun plays a blend of many metal genres, including power metal, black metal, melodic death metal, and others.  Though, Wintersun is none of these alone.  The songs are epic and filled with emotion.  The catchy riffs, solos, amazing drumming and haunting vocals really drive the mood of this album.  If you are into old Children of Bodom, Ensiferum, and some other bands along those lines, but are looking for more...then look no farther. Wintersun by Wintersun is waiting for you.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Wow what to say about this movie? There is a degree of story tie ups required from the TV show firefly that is incorporated into this.  It moves a bit on the slow side but it needs to.  If it moved any faster nothing would be understood.  You won't know what the movie is about until near the end and that will also be the point when you decide if you like it or not.
0810945797|5.0|This reedition was long awaited and now I see it's simply delightful. Detailed presentation, awesome drawing and descriptions, it speaks for itself it's been compiled and conceived with an exquisite taste. It includes some extra copies from original designs in fine paper into some kind of envelope. This book is a must for everyone who loves \\"The Dark Crystal\\" and wants to know beyond and before... I do love this book.
B000002UY5|5.0|Its hard to place where Blind Melon belongs in the era of Rock. I know they didn't belong in the programmed 90's era of MTV children. Hippy music in the 90's was destined to be overlooked. The cool thing is that people will stumble upon this band forever and I only wish like many of Blind Melon fans that Shannon Hoon could have delivered us more. But then again, he delivered just enough. My advice is listen to the CD and read the words. You may be surprised at what it means to you.

B00003CXRM|5.0|What can anybody say about this movie!  It's a real classic.  Quirky, funny, sad, uplifting, delightful!  Highlights the versatility of these fantastic actors, but it's not really George Clooney singing.  A must-have for the film aficionado.
B00005JPLW|4.0|I am glad I was forwarned that this film is every sense of the word a man's movie because 300 wasted no time getting to the nitty gritty.  I am glad that Headley's character (Queen of Sparta) exhibited courage and loyalty.  In other words there was no dumbing down women and the part they play in supporting or and nuturing their men. Okay-back to the main attraction.  Visually, this movie is stunning.  Every scene is eye candy for the audience and it is that-more than anything else that holds your attention.  For the first time, Dominic West put in a good performance. (Sorry, he does nothing for me on The Wire-good show though)  Gerald Butler was excellent as well as Santoro.  Overall: good entertainment, but like I always say-don't learn your history through Hollywood.
0743454537|5.0|As an infrequent reader who can takes weeks to finish a book because I don't have time.....I wound up reading this book in 3 days. Couldn't put it down. Touching - well written - creative - well thought out.  This was the first book I read of Jodi Picoult's and have decided she's an author that I need to read more of.   Highly recommended and you will recommend to others.
B0000DDAU9|5.0|Wow.  What can I say about this one?  This is a debut?  There must be some mistake.  Debut albums are never this good.    Remission grabs you by the mind from the start and does not let go.  I've never heard metal be so hypnotic before.  Hypnotic yet heavy.  At times, furious.  Favorite songs are \\"Trainwreck\\" and \\"Trilobite.\\"  \\"March of the Fire Ants\\" is also very good.  But, there is not a weak spot on the album.  I've never heard a metal band be so consistently great from one song to the next on albums before.  Mastodon is on the way up as a band.  Their newer stuff is getting all the hype, but don't ignore this masterpiece in the process.  This is their heaviest album.  It may be their best.    Someone here has called Mastodon a metalcore band.  I don't know what metalcore actually means, so I cannot comment on that, but in my view good music has no genre, only listeners.  This is good music, metal at its finest.  Don't pass this one by.  If you are looking for something new and different, try Mastodon.  If you've never heard any Mastodon before, start with Remission.  If you've never liked metal music before, Mastodon can change your mind.  If you want something different in your metal music collection, don't miss this band.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|I was never a Marvel kid. Until this movie came out, I had never really heard much about Ghost Rider. Now that I have and I have seen the movie, I am not eagerly anticipating more of it. That being said, the movie is pretty watchable and it looks good. It certainly isn't a benchmark for film or for comic book superhero movies. Marvel movies really aren't either. Spider-Man 1 and 2 are about it. Ghost Rider is the kind of cotton candy/popcorn movie that is easy to swallow, but is instantly forgettable once it's over. Nicolas Cage stars as Johnny Blaze, an Evel Knevel type motorcycle daredevil. Years ago, when Johnny was little, he made a deal with the devil after a close personal tragedy. The devil is Peter Fonda. Pretty fun casting really. Jump forward a number of years and grown up Johnny(Cage) is a much loved daredevil star. He knows what is keeping him alive and what has saved him from his jumps over the years that would of killed anyone else. One day, the devil comes to call. It appears Mr. Satan needs Johnny to pay his debt and become the Ghost Rider, a leather clad, fire lit skeleton with his nasty bike and chains. He needs the GR to track down and destroy an evil power that is loose on earth. Pretty standard stuff really. The movie has a fun cast, but they are not all up to the challenge. Nicolas Cage is Nicolas Cage, and even if the movie is awful, he is usually still watchable and interesting. He seems to kind of be sleepwalking thru the role, but he loves this stuff, so he was probably having fun. Fonda was interesting casting, and even tho he doesn't really have much to do, it's fun seeing him. His introduction and \\"far out\\" line was pretty good. Sam Elliot is always good. He has that voice, and you pay attention when he is on screen. Too bad he wasn't in a better movie. The worst of the lot was Eva Mendes. She is a raving beauty, but she seemed a little stilted in places, and some of her acting and delivery were a bit odd. Wes Bentley has nothing to do but be predictable, cliched evil. The writing is not very sharp, and some scenes and bits of dialogue tend to veer into total cheese territory, especially at the end with Cage having his final words with Fonda. Elsewhere, the movie looks great. The make-up and special effects are all fine and lots of fun. It is far from a perfect movie(did anybody think it would be anything else?), but Ghost Rider has it's simple minded entertainment to it and it's easy to watch. Hey, you might even enjoy it, but it will leave your memory, probably never to return, once the credits start to roll.
0812550706|5.0|The story is about training \\"kids\\" to become battle commanders to lead the Earth fleet to victory over the buggers (a pejorative word of the race of creatures that man finds himself fighting).  Ender Wiggin is selected to enter into the Battle School to join other recruits in determining the best of the best so that the top commander will be in control to decide the outcome of the impending battle of annihiliation between humans and buggers.  This is a good story that works more to expose the nature of the human condition than to give us any real star wars hero.  Ender Wiggin is put through grueling personal, physical, and psychological testing and, by the end of the book, the reader is filled with a deep abiding empathy with the boy genius.  The toll on his mind is astounding.  The toll on his soul is even worse.  Ender pays a great price in the learning process and testing that comes along with, first, Battle School, and then, Command School.  Little does he realize that he is also the victim of a great duplicity, which in the end only more greatly burdens him.  Then there is his rejection from all of humanity at the end.  It is a great and terrible thing to be Ender Wiggin.    If you at all enjoy stories of great and tragic endurance then Ender's Game is for you.  Other critics here have claimed that at times Ender's Game is poorly written and that it does not deliver for the reader.  I disagree.  The story is written fairly directly yet the maze of development could not have been better.  The concepts of the book are very stark and harsh, probably not very realistic, but are interesting to consider.  What length would the Earth go to in order to rid themselves of a perceived danger from another race in the universe?  Ender is the answer to that question.
B00005JODK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I can say.  I felt happy for hours after watching it.  It was energetic, happy, sweet, funny and delightful.  The casting was perfect.  Everyone seemed to give it there all.  The songs and dance sequences were very entertaining.  I especially loved the innocent chemistry between Nikki Blonsky and Zac Efron.  They are both very talented.  I would highly recommend this movie.  For those of us over 40 the energy of these kids is invigorating!  I hope this movie succeeds beyond all expectations so that they will make more like it in the future.

075640407X|5.0|So much of the fantasy we see today is so incredibly cliche. Patrick Rothfuss' novel is light a breath of clean, fresh air, blowing away the Xerox fumes.  An interesting, fully realized world, complex well-rounded characters, and a complex, over-arching story arc that is being slowly revealed.  The only downside is the wait for the next installment in the exceptional tale of Kvothe Kingkiller...
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a great buy... I spent a whole Sunday watching the entire season. Don't judge me...
B000F2C87Q|5.0|The Keys really get down to Kimbrough's no-nonsense no-prisoners style. I can listen to this EP over and over get something new out of it each time.
B000MRAAJW|3.0|I'm sure the High Def version is great for something like this... However, I bought it only to find that it didn't work with most of the players I had. It wouldn't play on XBOX, Playstation 3, or a regular DVD player. So only buy this if you know it works with your player, and know that you don't have the option of using it with anything else (reg DVD player).
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This movie succeeded in entertaining me throughout despite some dialogue being cheesy at times.  The most frightening thing of all is that you know there are people in the world who would certainly pay to do things like this.  I have to knock two stars off because of the stupidity of the main charactors, but I guess you need that to some degree to make a horror movie.  What I really don't understand are the reviews that call this pointless and disgusting??  Can I ask these folks what they were expecting?  Did you pick up the box at the rental place and think it was Gone With the Wind?  If you want to watch an unsettling and slightly disturbing movie you won't be disappointed by this one.  If you're looking for 2 hours of riveting plot and charactor development, check out the drama section.      Just as an aside, this is not nearly as stupid as Cabin Fever, I was afraid when I saw who directed it but fear not.
B000654YK6|4.0|I was *very* impressed with this film. I had already seen Doug Pray's \\"Scratch\\" documentary, and felt the need to work my way back from there. I spent the latter part of my adolescense and most of college in the midst of the grunge \\"revolution,\\" wholly unaware of its true musical origins in the pacific northwest (I'm speaking of the original bands themselves, not demographically). My only complaint with this film is that it wasn't long enough, and Doug definitely seemed to side with those who felt the \\"scene\\" had been compromised...but it seems to me that the owners of Sub Pop are the ones who made that determination. The majors just capitalized on their decision to \\"go commercial\\" -
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins lays out the most prominent cases against religion from societal to cosmological. If you're just starting to question your faith, or just starting to understand why you don't have any, 'The God Delusion' will cover the basics of why you might be right to doubt the claims of every religion.
B000002JSR|2.0|The first time I heard about this album was right after Robert Plant released his 1st solo album. I was anticipating a lot of new material (looking at the track listing on the back record cover).  Only to be disappointed at the quality of the songs.  Thus with my entire Led Zeppelin collection (I have them all), this is the least played album with the exception of the song \\"Wearing & Tearing\\".      And with a limited amout of studio recording material to put on the album, I was suprised they didn't include \\"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\\" which was only released on B side of a 45 RMP record instead of a live version of \\"I Can't Quit You\\".
1591791707|5.0|This audiobook is a really neat exploration of how to communicate honestly to positive ends.     The cds are dotted with Rosenberg relating conversations that employ each technique he discusses. While actual tapes of the conversations would have been more illustrative, they are still believable.    The message is really about how to enact harmonization instead of blunt decisions in disagreements, as well as exploring your own values and how to communicate those values to others.
0152023984|4.0|As I begin this review I think that there must be tons of reviews out already since it's just a classic. Does anybody still need a summary and opinion? Well, maybe you do. Maybe you're like me who knew about the book, has met many people who love it and could never bring yourself to read it. Well, for you, I will write this review.<br /><br />He story is a fable: a stranded pilot meets The Little Prince who shares with him his discoveries about the people and things he has met on his journey away from home. The Little Prince is like a child in many ways as he is open, curious, and accepting. But he is wise, too, knowing about what's truly important in life: friendship, responsibility for your friends, and enjoying things for what they are without trying to make them into something that you want.<br /><br />When parts of the book were read to me in middle school I immediately despised it. A little prince fussing over a pretentious rose, how stupid was that?! I had to turn 38 to be able to read this book about love and friendship and life because I couldn't allow myself to be vulnerable to its message before now. I'm grown-up enough now to mourn the lack of responsibility I've shown towards the people I've tamed. And even harder for me: I'm grown-up enough now to mourn the lack of responsibility that people who tamed me have shown towards me. And I'm working on accepting the fact that I need to let go and try again to do better every day.
