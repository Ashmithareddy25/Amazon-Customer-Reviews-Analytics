B00BUAEYVK|3.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />As a huge fan of the Die Hard franchise I made many attempts to see the fifth installment, A Good Day To Die Hard, when it was in theaters. However, the plans always fell through. As the credits began to roll at the end of the movie I started to think that maybe it was a sign. As I sat on my couch I couldn't help but wonder what went wrong. Surely I must have missed something during the past 90 minutes. It couldn't have been that bad, could it? As I laid in bed I told myself I had to re-watch it because I missed something. That was the only explanation. Sadly, nothing changed even after I sat through it a second time.<br /><br />It would be hard for me to summarize the plot because, truthfully, it's all over the place. One thing the Die Hard franchise has always done well is provide the viewer with an interesting antagonist. Not only that, but they always made it a point to say \\"This man right here. Hey! He's the villain. He's why McClane is doing this.\\" That's not the case with this movie. Instead, we get \\"He's the villain. Nope, psych it's this guy. Wait, nope we changed our mind again. It's this guy now. Oh, remember how we spent the first 70 minutes talking about this? Well, that's not really what this movie's about. Hope you don't mind.\\" There's no direction, there's no banter between John and a main villain, there's nothing. The entire thing feels sloppily put together and, at times, amateurish.<br /><br />Then comes the pacing. It doesn't take long before we get the first big explosion and the movie doesn't let up until the credits start rolling. There's one over-the-top scene after the next and that's not what the Die Hard series is about. Yes, there's always been those larger-than-life moments, but they were always spaced out and they looked somewhat realistic. Every big scene in here just feels so fake and fabricated that the would-be \\"Wow\\" moments turn into grunts of disgust. For example, withinthe first 20 minutes or so John gets shot at with an RPG while driving a would-be 18 wheeler if it was carrying a shipment. So in an effort to avoid the missile he somehow spins the truck in a full circle while the missile flies past. Less than three minutes later we have John in a Mercedes vehicle driving on top of a bunch of cars trying to get on the freeway. It was just so... corny.<br /><br />I haven't even mentioned the final scene yet. I kind of think their budget was running out because the further I got into the film the worse the presentation got. The guns looked like they weren't even shooting anymore and the big finale looked like a CGI sequence from a PS2 game. The cheesiness was so bad that it rivaled the cheesy moments from the first film. With that said, I think the director attempted to have a throwback moment to the film that started it all. There's a segment where you see Yuri Kamarov (Sebastian Koch) falling from a skyscraper and it greatly resembles the scene from the original where Hans was falling out of the window. Also, some of the compositions, provided by Marco Beltrami, resembled some of the compositions from the first film. Unfortunately, that's where the enjoyment stops with the score because the rest of the compositions are all generic pieces we've heard dozens of times before in other action films.<br /><br />As if all that wasn't bad enough, we're given Jack (Jai Courtney) and boy I haven't hated a character in a movie this much in a long time. All this man does is whine and complain. They tried to portray him as this strong male who (sort of) did good things for himself even though his father wasn't there in his life, but I couldn't help but think that he was just this huge brat with daddy issues. If your dad is John McClane you have no right to complain! That's just a law. He's out there saving lives and being a badass and you're mad because he wasn't home to have dinner with you? Come on. I mean even Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)didn't complain this much in Live Free or Die Hard and she at least had some personality. Jack is just awful.<br /><br />Finally, we all love John McClane. There's no question that he's become a household name amongst film enthusiasts. Unfortunately, it feels like his character got put on the back-burner in an effort to showcase Jack. Gone are the witty one-liners, gone are the crazy fistfights, gone is the near-constant connection with the villain. Hell, even his infamous \\"Yippie-Kay-Yay\\" line felt misplaced when he used it. They tried to throw in a joke or two, but none of it really made me laugh as I was only able to muster a pathetic chuckle at times. This was like the final nail in the coffin for me. This one missing element is what really makes this movie not feel like a Die Hard film. If you don't have the right portrayal of John McClane then all you have is Bruce Willis in another generic action flick.<br /><br />Standout Score: 5/10 - Coming from someone who was never fond of Die Harder, A Good Day To Die Hard is by far the worst entry in the series. Not only is the plot terribly boring, the movie itself lacks in the comedy department and it suffers from some extremely poor pacing. It feels like they're trying to do away with John to try and make room for Jack and I hope that's not the case. Jack lacks the spark that makes John so fun to watch and I can't see him carrying an entire film on his own. I'm not sure what John Moore was thinking with this, but if they plan on making a sixth movie I really hope he's not in charge again.

B009CF7GRY|3.0|It was OK. I liked the original one better. I think Kevin Bacon played a much better role & I loved Kevin's dancing the best!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Pros:  checklist or text options, color coordinate, pin memos to status bar, share feature, backup, free.<br />Cons: Couldn't really think of any.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Have a kindle fire hd and downloaded this app. At first it worked good, but now it has ,trouble downloading, gives limited videos on search, stops for no reason, and when you click on a video and it is by an Amazon add, you get the add and not the video.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|super cool app! this kept me busy for a while. Would reccommend this to anyone. My mother loved this app as well.
0679720200|5.0|I was intrigued at how seemingly innocent and unmeaning gestures can cause grave damage to one. It held my interest.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've seen the stage production and looked forward to this movie version. Excellent acting, wonderfully done. I like the songs so much that I sometimes play the DVD while I'm doing something else, just to listen to the music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Brilliant game,solve the puzzles get out of the room. Something different from the usual search games. Definitely addicted to this one.

B0064MPXFA|4.0|I am using my Roku and have watched the entire first season. I am addicted! And I am now on season 2.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book  is great I was thinking of buying it for a long time and it was not a waste of money when I did.it is a book about how a boy goes through school with a deformed face.I highly recommend this book!!!!!!!!!it is great!!!!!!!
B00BB22GQM|3.0|I heard this group talking about their latest CD on NPR with Terry Gross and they played Diane Young.  I liked it very much and bought the CD for that one song.  I didn't really care for the rest of the CD.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Had the other 5 seasons. This set was priced well, completed the collection. It was of good quality, no problems.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the suspense of finding out who Nell's real family was. I did find it somewhat difficult to keep all the characters' names connected to their identities, especially between jumping back & forth between the present & the past, however, after I got accustomed to that, the story was great. I read it as a book club choice, & I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a well written good read.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|I've meet the guy & he's gayish, he's 2nd wife apploagized directly about his moronic jurk behavior. He's a has-been!
B004G606K8|4.0|I read these books as a kid, maybe in my early teens, so I was pleased to see they had finally come to kindle.  Reading them again has reminded how much I enjoyed them, and while the narrative borrows heavily from epic classics, there is a genuinely original feel to the story and the characters.  I don't know about the various other 'spin off' trilogies in this set, but the main three are great for young adults (and older adults who want to remember!).
B000001EYO|5.0|Husband and wife both love the Dude and TBL movie and memorabilia. It started with wife making a closing argument statement that lead to both of them rolling with laughter &#34;This is not vietnam...There are rules!&#34; And getting something for the husband now that reminds us of fun times is priceless, also the laughter we share, songs we know and sing in our head or out loud, are the little things that tie us together and that is what the product represents to me.
B009PLKPMS|5.0|It was completely perfect<br />The original demos, the b-sides, the unreleased Demos, the new songs, all of it is amazing.<br />As only McFly could do
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book!!! It was amazing,funny,and kept you wanting more. I would recommend this to all as a must read!!!
B001IYCMNA|5.0|This is a solid WAP.  I have two installed in a church with 2 SSID's on separate VLAN's (1 for the church and 1 for guests), and I had the same problems with one of them loosing connection to the LAN every 2 weeks.  I checked the FW version and found out it was not the most current, so I updated and I have not had the problem in over 2 months.  I have since ordered and installed 2 more in another church - these came with the latest FW and they function brilliantly.  Both of these installs are connected to a managed L2 PoE switch with QoS.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone..... for a b/g/n WAP with up to 4 SSID's at this price point IS AWESOME!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Finally the new update!(0.7.0)now you could get a mojang account on this...Also it now as spawning eggs,cake and water and lava!so glad.
B00380URIO|5.0|Sam Rockwell does a brilliant job.  Explores the idea of deep isolation in a far away location with just yourself and some old tapes for company.  I've watched this half a dozen times, and get something new out of it every time.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|\\"Serpico\\" is a perfect blend of fine acting, great story, and thoughtful direction. One of the best movies from the 1970s, it shows you don't need car chases and special effects to make an exciting film.
B00CM96A60|5.0|Good music, I listened to the album over a dozen times so far.  Some really good tracks.  They played the h3ck out of it on XM, and I had to buy the album.  Amazon is by far the best place to make an album purchase.  Mp3 and digital cloud.  Why yes please!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is touching and funny and sad. I'm not really sure what to say because I don't want to give the ending away, but you should read this book because it is a book worth your time.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I play this game when I don't get laid. it helps pass the time. I wish more games were like this
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|It s give you a very good idea of the time where everything is developed.  I think Jane Austen gives a very good picture of the situation where the novel is developed
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This boos was really good, I have been reading the books since 3rd grade and have adored the last few and sure hope they will make more for me to enjoy the book series.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|After hearing numerous bad reviews of this film, from Rotten Tomatoes to channels on my Sirius radio, I was flabbergasted. The trailers looked so cool. But I knew that I've seen many a movie where the trailer looked so good, but the film wasn't.<br /><br />Was it possible that Man of Steel was going to be the same?<br /><br />I loved Zak Snyder's 300, and his previous zombie movie remake of Dawn of the Dead. But his Sucker Punch left me high and dry. (Even though the numerous dream action sequences were awesome!)<br /><br />So, with hopeful and high expectations, I went to see Zak's re-imagining of Superman last night - and I was blown away! (As was my wife and son, as well as the other four people we went with, ranging in age from kid, teen and adults, both male and female. All of them loved it, too!<br /><br />So there ya go film critics. Again, you got it all wrong.<br /><br />This is quite easily director Zak Snyder's most ambitious and biggest film of his career - and his best!<br /><br />Take note Hollywood! Even though your industry is banking on teens and tweens to go to the movies to make you your money - us adults still go to the movies too! Especially when you make them like this.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|When I first read this book, i thought it was the best thing ever. Now that I have been reading it for like a gazillion times, i see more mistakes. like at first it says that Annabeth loved Pecy from the start and then it says that she thought he was annoying at first......?????? overall u should definatley BUY IT!!!!!!<br />I &#60;3 LEO VALDEZ!!!!!!!
B00632HWOG|4.0|This worked wonderfully for me before, but is acting strange now. When I tried to log in, it said that I was too young to use Yahoo. I know that the age minimum for Yahoo is 13,and just posting my review means that I am over that age. I rated based on how it worked before,  but this bug has really lowered my expectations.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I enjoyed this book and can not wait to begin the next one. Hopefully they continue the movie series as well.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|Someone on IMDB said that those who read the Superman comics tend to like this film and those who don't are the ones who don't like it. I'd say that's very accurate in my case, as I've never read a comic in my life, and I don't care for this movie at all. I am much more a fan of the Reeve movies, which this has absolutely nothing in common with, making it much like the Star Trek series reboot.<br /><br />Some think that those of us who liked the older movies more just wanted a lot of camp in the new one. But for me, that couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, I hated the camp in the older movies. But the superman of old had a charisma about him that is completely missing here. In Superman (1978), we get a chance to get to know the character a little before the plot shifts into full gear.  In MoS, he puts on the cape, barely has time to learn how to fly, and then Zod shows up. From that point on (about halfway through), the movie basically becomes a non-interactive video game that pretty much doesn't stop until the end. You can tell that he's not yet comfortable in the suit, and the humans don't even know if he means to do them harm.<br /><br />When the fight between superman and the bad guys starts, you will see them get thrown about and plow right through buildings and completely rip up the streets until they finally skid to a halt. And I was actually impressed the first couple of times this happens. But after it happens a couple more dozen times, I found myself glancing at my watch, wondering when it was going to end, and getting a headache because the soundtrack is LOUD, and they had dragged it on entirely too long. There is a point where you can have too much of a good thing in this regard. (Oh, and of course you're going to see the military get involved, who are virtually useless.)<br /><br />Probably the most disturbing thing about it is all the destruction that happens as a result of these fights. You'd think superman would try to draw the fight away from the city in order to avoid as much loss of life as possible, but nope. This version of superman doesn't appear to care one way or the other.  Fans of MoS would say that 'this is the comic book version of superman, not the Reeve version.' Well, apparently then, the comic book superman is kind of a jerk with little regard for human life, whom I really don't care to root for. But the biggest problem is at the end, when he appears overly concerned with the fate of one family, we're supposed to feel his anguish over the decision he has to make, but the filmmakers apparently want us to forget that this comes right after the fight he just had with the villains probably killed thousands of people.<br /><br />In the end, if you went to see the Star Trek reboot in 2009 and ended up angry that you got Star Wars instead, you might have a similar reaction to this film. It isn't Star Wars, but it isn't Superman either. It's more like Independence Day. So, you have been warned :P
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is very addictive you have to make yourself to take a break this is very exciting game to play
B007L24T52|4.0|Once you start reading you will not stop till you get to the last page. So, sure I do recommend it.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|These guys are still the best kids in town. I,m 83, a semi-retired musician, and still play and enjoy music from the 30's, 40's and 50's, and the big band era. But I rate the Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour at the top of my collection. Excellent musicians, composers, and arrangements. And Joe Walsh's One Day At A time is a masterpiece. The mixing and recording of their on stage performance was excellent. I hope the Eagles will do another Farewell Tour.
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|A wonderful series of short stories about human colonization of Mars.  It remains one of Ray Bradbury's very best collections of short stories.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is pretty cool I've always loved horses but never go to ride them this app allows me to do that and I love it it's awesome!  But everyone's opinion differs might have a diff one
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Thinking this was going to be the last book I got in the mind set of an awesome ending but was completely bummed by how Sylvia ended it. Of course, I'll still be buying the next one but who knows when that will be released.. Great story and always engaging just a bit disappointing because of the ending..
B00C4U9U4Q|4.0|this is the sound if madonna fronted omd, if teri nunn fronted pet shop boys, if cyndi lauper fronted human league.<br />it doesn't hurt that charli is very attractive and causes feelings all over our nubile,innocent bodies that make us good boys and girls turn bad and have us wanting to be seduced and satisfied in ways that have us closing the curtains,turning off the lights and locking the doors.<br />misbehaved lady ga-ga and naughty katy perry will be supporting charli soon .<br />madonna will be asking charli to write songs for her .
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I bought this for my teenage daughter and she loved it! She recommended I read it--which I did. It was a good suspenseful and fun read. I really enjoyed the surprising twist at the end. I would recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a beautiful story, beautifully told, of family, caring and connection.  It is filled with wisdom, wrapped in lovely prose.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Very pleased with this book. It answers a lot of questions from previous Pendergast books. A must ready if you like the Pendergast books. Can't wait for the next one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The Icon to try it would suggest this is an older, cartoonish game but couldn't be farther from the truth. A great mix of speaking (I hate music soundtrack only games after the intro),  clever puzzles and a restrained number of HOGs within the story. I HAD to buy the full version after playing 20 mins as this one was obviously a cut above the rest. I'll be looking for more games by this developer in the hopes the rest are as good as this one.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Works well for my son, stands up with no problems, durable and definitely helps protect the Kindle. I would recommend.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|I got into Mott the Hoople when I was in college back in the late 80s and I've been a fan of the band and Ian's solo work ever since.<br /><br />I thought Ian's voice was sounding a little frail on \\"Man Overboard\\" and that he might be beginning to show his age, but in hindsight that was probably more the result of Ian throttling things back to suit the more mellow sound of the album.<br /><br />On \\"When I'm President\\" his voice is back with a vengeance. Listen to \\"What For\\" and marvel at how tough his vocals sounds for anyone of any age, let alone a septuagenarian.<br /><br />This whole album is awesome. Not only does it rock, but Ian's lyrics are brilliant and at times hilarious. With each listen I catch a new line that has me chuckling to myself. And the cd is only $10!!
B0067EKY7M|3.0|I like Ewan McGregor.  Nice one to add to the collection.  Although he keeps his clothes on. Odd to see him playing it so stuffy.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|What can I say? They lost my account (which contained months of work), and their customer service department has been utterly and completely unhelpful.
B005M2A4D4|4.0|Always wondered why the picture of the Doctor is from the back.  I liked this series. I like Matt Smith and Moffat's writing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Enjoyable and addictive. A bit annoying you have to spend your hard earned money to buy invest points, but if not you can wait to level up . Still a good game though
B006LSZECO|2.0|I never did decide who was the worst person in that marriage -- guess they deserve each other!  Sorry I recommended it to my book club before reading!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I would recomend this book to anyone who likes action, and it was a great book! I did not dislike any thing in this book.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Amazing book.. I thought it had way more details than needed( which is why it only got 4 stars) but a great book none the less . Can't wait to read the second and third ..
B004LWZW24|5.0|I love it but it is SCARY!! My son insisted I watch it since I like scary movies (don't know why I like to be scared at night!!) and so I rented it and it freaked me out a bit and had me thinking for a while. I bought this one for him on Amazon as a stocking stuffer for Christmas 2012. We watched it the next night again...eeeek!!!! Great storyline! Ending is a twister!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1878424505|1.0|This book was recommended to me and sounded really good. I StumbledUpon a cool Native American thing recently and figured that the Toltec had some cool stuff to say.<br /><br />The opening chapter describes why we need the \\"Four Agreements,\\" and in my humble opinion, it was the author just taking a metaphorical crap all over Western society.  For 20 or so pages, he just hates on humanity.<br /><br />I finished the first chapter and was mad. I wanted to fight the author for being such a pessimistic jerk.<br /><br />Although I don't have the book in front of me to point out examples, he basically says that we are raised into a world that is fake and sucks. Yes, parts of our world suck and are really bad, but you must be so ignorant to not see the greatness that exists EVERYWHERE!<br /><br />Life is good. Life is fun.<br /><br />That's my review. I did skim the four chapters about the agreements but didn't waste my time reading them.  Clearly this book failed at being some incredible eye-opener based on its popularity, despite the foreword saying it would share the great Toltec secrets.<br /><br />It seems to me that the author was out to make a quick buck. Loser.
B004SIP9MY|5.0|This was a great movie at the theater back in '97. I remember my husb and I went to see it on our honeymoon, I was<br />scared leaving the theater late at night!! I like it the best out of all of the Screams.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This movie was visually appealing and well worth the purchase. The storyline was awesome and the acting was phenomenal. I was a little sceptical especially seeing the rating but most of the people giving it bad marks was talking about paying for multiple versions of it. So, from a movie perspective outside of the cost, it was AMAZE!! The whole family loved this one.
B004SIP9P6|4.0|I like this one but Scream 1 was the best.. it was a little hokey but I love the main characters so I give it 4 stars :0)
B00BIVN82M|3.0|this is far from his best work.  he needs to choose  material to match his talent.  there  are songs out there that would  be better choices
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you liked MYST, you will like this game. The graphics are great, and the interface is easy to learn and use. While there isn't as much environmental complexity as MYST (you're inside a single room figuring out a single complex machine) the challenges are similar and enjoyable. Overall, while the developer over-stated the peril aspect of this game, it holds up to any other immersive puzzle game and I can recommend it highly.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|i wanted really badly to love this movie..the story is interesting and there is a fanbase for such stories (see pride and prejudice and zombies) but i gotta say..the acting was just ok...i didnt get a sense of real fear or struggle and i really didnt care who lived or died. it was just...ok
B00499K9E0|5.0|This series is a wonderful modern adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, with new stories that are handled similarly to how the original Holmes and Watson might have done.  Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant and convincing as a modern Sherlock Holmes.  I laughed when I first saw him insisting on texting to someone in the same room because I could just see Sherlock Holmes doing that.  Martin Freeman is also wonderful as Dr. Watson. (I know I'm reusing adjectives)<br /><br />This series/season (the first) is very well done.  I am cautious about accepting movie or television versions of books I've loved, but this one is ok by me.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|it was ok..glad i didnt spend full price at a movie house to watch. acting was good..story  was ok...it reminded me of a short story that was drawn out to a feature length movie it was tooooo long over all and the few parts they should of spent more time on -like  the childrens relationship with the uncle before the accident and the thought process of the girlfriend-were way to short. instead they filled the movie up with  scifi channel-like special effects and unneeded dialogue. the ending was abrupt-though the build up was too long ..lol i know it sounds like i cant make up my mind but once you watch it, you'll understand what im saying..its an ok movie something to watch once but i expected more from the man who brought us Pan's Labyrinth.
B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|I have watched all the other movies in the series and I think this is the worst of them all.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|i waited to rent this movie because along time ago i paid  good money to see sylvester stallone crap all over one of the greatest comics ever. hell im so old i remember when Anthrax wrote a song called &#34;i am the law&#34;-about Judge Dredd- though i know Karl Urban can act-having seen him in LoTR, but i also saw him in the chronicles of riddick  sooo......  so needless to say i didnt have high hopes for this movie....boy, was i wrong!!!!!! Karl did AMAZEING!! he never took off his helmet so all his acting was done with his chin ..well and his voice too. the set looked great Lena Headey was a kool bad guy.. girl? i dont want to give anything away but trust me....this movie is worth seeing
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was an amazingly romantic novel. Even though it had a few unexpected twists it was a little bit predictable.
B00BYH6MZK|3.0|It is hard for me to get into a movie that goes so slow.  I eventually fell asleep.  Usually, I love both Mark Wahlburg and Russell Crowe, so it was somewhat disappointing.
1863513418|4.0|I wish it was colourfully illustrated, there are just few pages with works' photoes other pages are just  descriptions with poor black and white drawings, but it's good if you are professional in embroidery and you'll find lots of know-how
B0026IQYEU|5.0|Everyone I know LOVES this movie.  If you can tolerate being sad with the ultimate goal of feeling victorious and happy, it is a movie for you!  I am a teacher and my high schoolers even loved it.
0671646788|5.0|Inspiring book!! Recommend to everyone i know and meet once i started reading this it was really hard to stop until the end.
B000JG9ZXI|5.0|This is a classic film by Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense and drama. Cary Grant places an American in France who during the war was a jewel thief. He also worked for the resistance during the war years. For his second story work John Robie the character that Cary Grant plays goes to jail. The story begins many years after the war when John Robie has retired from being a jewel thief and now is living the life of Riley on the Riviera. Having visited the French Riviera many years ago I can relate to many of the scenes and places depicted in the film. Grace Kelly is Cary Grant's love interest in the film but not by design; well see it and you will see. I gave it five stars because it was a most enjoyable film. The photography was priceless! It is a film you see from time-to-time to reminisce as well as to see a great movie with exceptional great actors and actress that tell you that these performers were heads above many we see today with all the gore and mayhem! Also being a fan of Alfred Hitchcock I always look to see his cameo shot in each film he directs. In closing I would say the film is a must see for all Cary Grant and Grace Kelly movie fans!
B009RX7WTI|5.0|This is probably the best entertaining and tragic series that I have ever had the pleasure to watch. In fact I don't watch it on television, I buy the series every year because I can't imagine watching this extraordinary show with moments so harsh and shocking only to be interrupted by commercials or wait for the next week or next season talk about shrinking the....drama. I can't, the shock value is so much more when it's not interrupted plus you get all kinds of fun information on the actors on the characters and not to mention the bloopers and I love How Meredith Grey-Ellen's Pompeo's laugh is so great I start laughing and it's the same laugh in the bloopers as it is in the series and of course how can one outdo McDreamy, McSteamy, McBitchy, and George's famous McVomit....I have bought every years' series, and I will continue until one day some fool cancels it. But I will always have it. How would you like having a person like Cristina Yang..and their guest stars: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Kyle Chandler, can you say a lot McYummies...but why of why must they always die...Jeffrey Dean Morgan is the dad in Supernatural ....and well let's not reveal anything for those Supernatural fans.... Love this show, the entire cast, and the genius who thought it up! There aren't enough stars in the sky to give to this super medical drama show. OOPs this is for series 1 to 8 I don't think nine is out yet? It won't matter because I will love it as much as loved each and every season. This is for all the seasons fans already know what happened from to 8 and I can't wait for season 9 (which I should have received by now) hint, hint
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love it! I couldn't put the book down.  Can't wait for the next book it can't come soon enough. Need my fix.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best app ever. I play this app every day, and don't play my other apps that often. I got the update for it and it rocks. You can spawn sheep, pigs, cows, and chickens. You also get buckets of water and lava. From my opinion this is the best app ever. I think you should get this app. If I could I would give it 100,000,000 stars
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does what the app says, works well, no complaints here. Love how the app tells you exactly what you can do with the remaining battery life.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I don't usually do reviews but looking threw the Amazon market I've found many interesting games that need access to a ridiculous amount of information. This game is fun and slightly addictive but still safe, and I think it deserve  recognition for that.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It is a helpful app for a beginner such as I. Trying to find batter info on the device itself is still complicated - (for me anyway) :)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Good thanks.<br />This is one of my favorites movies.<br />It gives out a great message and it invites you<br />to reflect on how you are in life and how situations<br />may change you highly recommended.!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|awesome season, sorry to see this series come to an end.  Dexter will sorely be missed<br />but we can always watch our dvds
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon sanderson created a new wonderful world full of history, intrigue, and war. I enjoy it completely. Recommend it to anyone looking for a new epic fantasy series, Sanderson will deliver.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|There is a good selection of sounds on this application. From the grandfather clock that helped soothe my puppy in her kennel to the camp fire that soothes me, I am happy I found this application!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy these beautiful puzzles. They are so vibrant and lovely. I don't have to worry about missing pieces, glue or finding room around the house. The problem is it stops running quiet often.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|A wonderfully, well done, end to this epic series. Captures the book completely and is a dark but fun adventure with our favorite characters.
0143122916|4.0|Eye-opening!  Gives you keen insight into North Korean mentality and philosophy towards war and treatment of humans, including Koreans. Recommended reading.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|We have this on all our devices, everyone playing their own game and competing for the high scores. Just now got a new device and am starting from scratch... is still fun getting used to the basic cars before upgrading them after having them all maxed on my phone. Hella time killer!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Epic is entertaining and easy to play. Fun for all ages.  My son who is six cannot get enough of it.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|We enjoyed the early Fringe shows but they quickly became too complex and 'strange.' In contrast, Eureka is almost believable and the insertion of brief bits of humor make it fun as well! An enjoyable 45 minutes!
B000002RXS|3.0|Unfortunately Callas recorded this after her voice had peaked.  It is still lovely but  not as good as it would have been earlier in her career.  It is enjoyable to listen to separately but not with other operatic recordings.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is a great app, I love all the games like this and this one isn't any different. Looking forward to playing it all the time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Good game. Can entertain you for a long time. Good graphics. Very nice armors and special powers. I recommend it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love having quick and easy access to my Facebook account anywhere there is WiFi, easy to use, no problems at all.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|It works but leaves big distortions in the transition. I should have know it was too inexpensive to be workable.  Junk.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The writing and story lines are intelligently written, well acted, timely. The weekly story is fresh, yet with that serial format that is compelling.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|As a retired &#34;GI&#34;  I remember all those things that made this movie great.  The badass DI, the troops who were the weak link, the hooker who says I love you long time&#34; .
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Start by watching season 1 and progressing to season 3.  It is elegant, dignified, respectful AND realistic.  A period piece both historically accurate and beautifully presented.
0061478784|4.0|I have had this book to read forever and was so excited to finally get around to reading it.  I watched the movie a long time ago and enjoyed it, but wanted more depth to that interesting story.  This was a well done fantasy book, that had an old time fairy tale feel to it.  My main complaint that the ending was a bit rushed. There are two sequels to this book: Castle in the Air and House of Many Ways.<br /><br />I listened to this on audiobook and the audiobook was very well done.  The narrator has an English accent which fits this fairy tale type of story perfectly and did a wonderful job with the character voices.<br /><br />Sophie is the eldest of three children in a hat-makers shop.  As such, she feels that she is destine to lead a boring and uneventful life.  Things change when she runs afoul of the Witch of the Waste while selling the Witch a hat.  The Witch turns Sophie into an old woman.  Sophie leave the hat shop and journeys to Howl's Castle in hope that he can break the spell on her and return her to her youthful self.<br /><br />This was a well done children's book with a fairy tale feel to it. The world is a typical olden time fantasy world with Kings and magic and castles. I loved the idea of Howl's floating castle and the Wicked Witch of the west.  This is a magical story full of lessons on life, love, and happiness.<br /><br />The characters did leave a bit to be desired for me though.  Sophie's personality matches that of a cranky old woman perfectly, even before she is a cranky old woman.  I think that is part of the irony in her being turned into a cranky old woman.  I didn't really enjoy her all that much.  The huge decision she makes to go Howl's castle she blames on being in shock from the transformation and to be honest she doesn't do much but be incredibly stubborn for large portions of the book.  She also is very caustic and rude to Howl throughout the whole book.  She never lets him get a word in edgewise and never lets him actually explain anything.  She continually calls Howl a \\"slitherer-outer\\", which seems hypocritical to me since Sophie is constantly trying the slither out of her own live and out of making any decisions.<br /><br />I like Howl's character better but he was still hard to engage with.  Howl is a first rate womanizer and (Sophie is right, he is a slitherer-outer) tries to get out of having any responsibilities at all.  He pretends to be mysterious and hard-hearted but it is extremely apparent that he is not any of those things.  He was a very stereotypical bachelor type character (he has a messy house, eat poorly, and is always after women).<br /><br />The best character of the bunch is Calcifier, the fire demon that lives in Howl's fireplace.  He is much more fascinating than either Sophie or Howl, and I would have liked to read more about him.<br /><br />Sophie's sisters are also delightful characters.  They are full of mischief and add more life to the story than Sophie ever does.  I especially enjoyed Sophie's sister's magic teacher, she was a funny and engaging character.<br /><br />Behind all of the Sophie/Howl disagreements there is a larger part to the plot.  The King wants Howl to rescue his brother from the Witch of the Waste, of course Howl is doing his best not to get involved.  This part of the story was largely in the background.  To be honest this portion of the story isn't really dealt with until very late in the book.  The way it wraps up is creative and interesting, but also very rushed and a bit confusing.  This would have been better if Jones had taken a bit more time to explain and wrap up the mystery behind the Witch of the Waste and the King's brother.<br /><br />So to be honest, while I enjoyed this cute little fairy tale story, it didn't awe me or blow me away.  The characters left something to be desired, the pacing was slow in the beginning and rushed at the ending, also things get a bit confusing at the end and could have used some better explanation.<br/><br />In addition to the above there are some mysteries  around the \\"other world\\" Howl goes to that are never well explained.  The \\"romance\\" between Howl and Sophie (if you can even call it that) felt forced, awkward, and rushed as well.<br /><br />Overall this was a decent fairy tale like story.  I enjoyed the world and Howl's magical castle and the whimsical tone to the story.  I also enjoyed Calcifer the fire demon and his sharp wit.  I thought Howl and Sophie were probably the least interesting characters in the book.  I also thought the pacing was off and that there were a lot of things left unanswered.  After writing this review I guess I felt a bit let down by this book, my expectations were really high though....so that's kind of my own fault.  I most likely will not be reading the sequels to this book.  There are just too many other wonderful middle grade fantasy stories out there to read./><br />In addition to the above there are some mysteries  around the \\"other world\\" Howl goes to that are never well explained.

B009ZXT4BY|2.0|I got this game because I thought it was like the full version.but then it ends up after playing a world for long it won't let me use that world anymore.I don't understand the developers of this game should fix that stupid massage to stop coming while I'm playing.I use the full version for now.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I loved this game until I saw other players had cool things like crafting and other dragons and habitats that you just don't get if you play with a kindle. also if you have a kindle your gave hardly ever gets fun up dates like the others. its just not fair
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game! I haven't found a better dress up app in a long time. I defiantly think that people thinking of getting this app should. It's amazing!
B001FA0H3E|2.0|Very disappointing ending.  All of the characters and their stories make for great reading.  But, the last pages made it seem like he just got tired of writing.  It was a great waste of time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|finally this game is available for androids. I've been waiting for ever for this to happen.BEST GAME EVER. AWESOME EPIC OUSTANDING
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|So contrary to the many reviews that praise the movie neither I nor my family were impressed with this prequel.<br /><br />The opening sequence filmed in a small format 4:3 aspect ratio only highlighted a poor beginning. It quickly turned off the kids and unfortunately the slow start continued to drag along throughout the length of the movie.<br /><br />I found that even though some of the visual effects and especially some of the scenery was visually stunning it did nothing to carry a slow and often boring movie.<br /><br />The end was ok at best. The original was something special. And this is coming from someone who does not like old shows or movies. The original had a beat to it, it moved on and kept you intrigued. This one seemed more to tow you along lifelessly hoping for something worthwhile to happen.<br /><br />I'd say Netflix it but don't rush out to buy it before you see it.
B0085A9J18|4.0|First off: this film was intense. The story itself was cleverly designed to take full advantage of its location, and its talented performers. It was filmed and edited for maximum impact, without a wasted word or shot.<br /><br />A SWAT team is sent to take out a crime boss, in a building full of criminals.<br /><br />About ten minutes into this film I thought: I've seen this, or something very like it, before.<br /><br />The basic scenario is a lot like the recent reboot of [[ASIN:B00ARF92HK Dredd]] with Karl Urban: hopelessly outnumbered law enforcers get trapped in an apartment complex run by a ruthless criminal overlord, who then offers a reward to the residents for their assassination. Of course Dredd is science fiction, and this one focuses more on martial arts than gunplay, but they are otherwise quite similar.<br /><br />It turns out I'm not the only one who thought this; but it seems that the overlapping plots are mere coincidence, as both projects were being developed at the same time by different people.<br /><br />Both films are worth watching for lovers of intense, action-packed thrillers. I tend to prefer science fiction to action - but I actually liked this film better than Dredd because the martial arts on display was nothing short of astonishing. The plot was thin - but here the editing for intensity, and the talented performers was more than enough to keep me watching and on the edge of my seat.
B008220BP2|5.0|What more can I say? It's so amazing and I love the little laughs! I would definitely recommend this to everyone I know, because it's that awesome.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|Nothing earth shattering, just a good gunfire and explosion movie that is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|After having this installed for less than 24 hours, I removed it.  It kept crashing when I tried to launch it.  Note that it requires a 580 MB download to work.  Fun game, too bad it stopped working.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Well, after all these years, the final chapter(?) has been written for Sookie.  I am very ambivalent about this final book. A part of me feels like it deserves a one.  The past few books have really deteriorated from all fives to barely twos.  Without any spoilers, the plot had too many deus ex machina, just too contrived.  It was like she wanted everything tied up with a pretty bow. I really feel once the True Blood series (yuck, yuck, yuck!) started, Ms. Harris seemed to neglect the books.  But then I also feel like she did right by Sookie, from where she was 13 books ago to where she was on the last page. So I am glad I stuck this series out.  Bon Temps, La was been a great place to visit over the last few years!  Oh and my usual disclaimer, I am the cheap mom! While I adore my kindle fire, I got this book from my local library (free!).
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The perfect app for horse lovers. Would be a good virtual world pet for kids to teach responsibility. Like many apps, spending real money can keep things flowing smoothly and make it more fun.<br /><br />After having played with this app for a couple of days I have to move my rating from a 5 to a 3. The graphics are awesome, it's very fun and also addictive. Along with these things it becomes VERY expensive. As you increase in levels you have to use real money to buy gems to even practice or play the competition. I can see myself not being able to afford this for very long.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|this is a great app but after the second  cloud city update it would not let me play cloud city it would just kick me out
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Starts out simple enough but ends with many turns you wouldn't expect. Well written and captivating.  It was hard to put down.
B00881PTRC|5.0|FUN TO PLAY AND ENJOY THE PLAY OF HANG MAN AS THE PIX GETS BUILD IN THE TIME OF PLAY
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|Came in great time and I was thankful that it came so quickly.  It's on of my favorite albums of all time. So glad to have it!  Thanks.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|If you have ever wavered in your faith... read this book. A pragmatic and erudite medical (scientific) professional uses his personal NDE to explain how we fit in God's grand plan. He sheds light on a controversial and  subjective - &largely unprovable - experience, and does so with clear descriptive writing. I finished this book, eager to delve into Dr. Alexander's reading list. encouraging. A great read, start to finish.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game has found a very good balance between playability and making it difficult enough to keep it interesting. Very enjoyable to play and makes you think just enough.
B0067EKY7M|2.0|Needed more development of the character who wanted to salmon fish.to make the improbable seem possible. Scattered, Time wasted.  Not woven together well.  R.W. Tolber
B00AEBB932|5.0|What can I say? No other film like it and even with violence the genuine point made, is that we humans all have choices and decisions to make concerning our actions when confronted with temptation or need, but here we see the greatness achieved when we make the right ones, based more on what God looks for in us.Have to admit though, when that little boy says good by to Shane the tears just come right on and my heart breaks.
B009LFVV6M|5.0|It's the best love story I have ever seen! For a chic flic it was worth watching!  We got the ultimate collectors box and it even came with the locket from the movie. My beautiful wife liked that alone with it being in blu ray wow what a picture. I had never seen before bit my wife said it was like a new movie!! Worth the money!!!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This is a great game, enjoyable and challenging. This game follows the same theme as the other &quot;Flow&quot; games with some new twists that keeps it enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games. Like most books this was far better than the movie. Enjoyed reading it. Very entertaining.To the next one
B002FE5XVK|5.0|This film combines footage of Talking Heads in concert, shot over three nights at the Pantages Theater in Hollywood in December 1983 as part of the `Speaking in Tongues' tour. An early directorial effort by Jonathan Demme, it was completely financed by the band (at a reputed cost of more than US$1million) and the first ever to deploy 100% digital sound recording. The result is widely regarded as a leading contender for the best rock movie ever made.<br /><br />Having owned the VHS video for 25 years, I have to say the Blu-Ray transforms the viewing experience. The show opens with a performance of `Psycho Killer' by charismatic, eccentric band leader David Byrne on guitar and voice, playing over a thumping rhythm track on a 1980s ghetto-blaster placed on the stage beside him. It's absolutely riveting, mesmerizing to watch. The other band members gradually join him one by one and two by two, until all nine are onstage.<br /><br />The band's performance is truly awesome, and even if you were never a fan and haven't heard their music you're likely to be won over. It never lets up from start to finish, full of quirky touches like Byrne sprinting clockwise around the stage for several minutes while the rest of the band plays on, and the outrageous `fat suit' which transforms his physique.<br /><br />There has never been a band quite like Talking Heads, combining catchy tunes, exemplary musicianship, poignant social commentary in the song lyrics and performance-art. Their demise was a loss to the spirit of true creativity and originality, but you still have this performance as a reminder of how great they were.<br /><br />The extras on the Blu-Ray offer an entertaining insight into the dynamics of the band, the mutual respect and good humored ribbing between the different members a persistent feature of the relationships behind this enduring music.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The only bad thing I can say is it was over. It kept me intrigued and couldn't put it down. If you like puzzles you will love this game. I can't wait until the next one.
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|Oh my... one of those movies that there is no plot, just cool stuff for special effects. Hot chicks tho:-)
B005LAIIPS|5.0|good movie very entertaining....
1608126579|1.0|The title should be \\"Me complaining about the world\\"<br />The author just talks about what his personal experiences, his mom advice, \\"the world that we live in\\", etc<br />He complains about the way we think but teaches nothing new!<br />By the way, he thinks analytically and sequentially just as he preaches!<br />If you want to hear the same thing over and over, obvious facts and stereotyped expressions, then you might like it.
B009MO57H6|4.0|its not one of my favorite movies from the seires but it was great to see many characters from the game in this and many of the former cast make a big return as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of fun.  I can waste lots of time with this app.  I recommend this one to my friends.<br />Easy for kids too.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. I got all of my family and friends to play too. It's fun. I wish there where more words, and you could have the bonus game like you get through Google. But it's great.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|The free version didn't even make me want to buy the full version, I find it remotely interesting or enjoyable.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Being a fan of the original Star Trek reruns since I was 7yrs old, space travel, alien species, and much wished for medical advancements are not new to me. What is new is the premise of living to the nice ripe age of 75, then leaving everything and everybody you have ever known or loved for a second chance at the possibility of renewed youth, regardless of the price.  So I purchased this book to see what the writer would do with it and boy am i glad I did. The book is well written and held my interest from the start. The protagonist, John, is likable and believable. The book is fast paced and descriptive in detailing the technology used and the battles fought, without being drawn out, overly complicated, or totally unbelievable. The only complaint I have is that the book was hard to put down once I started reading it. I highly recommend it.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Great Graphics and a lot of fun, very enjoyable and easy to play, reminds me of a few older games that I use to play, nice job guys!
0345803507|5.0|I kept hearing this book mentioned by friends and coworkers, but they would only say they enjoyed it. They weren't telling any of us what it was about, so I picked it up. Being a very genre based reader, choosing mostly crime dramas and completely outrageous supernatural type books, I was a little weary about this. Completely different than anything I would have normally read and an absolutely great read. I read the entire series in just 4 days! Now I find myself wondering what other books are similar.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|It's Star Wars! and It's Pinball, what could be better than that!!! Well a lot of things, But this app is great!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|A friend suggested I read this after 50 Shades, but I was a bit apprehensive. I have enjoyed other books by Sylvia Day, however, so I gave it a shot. I couldn't put it down. I have read two more books in this series and they are entertaining and well written.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is the bomb, and I hope they come out with more to add to it, I have never enjoyed a meditation, sleep machine so much, all the different combination you can do, it's amazing!!!! Keep working on it guys! Add lots more!!!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|with &#34;time&#34; rod stewart made an excellent new album for relaxing and just hanging aroung. sounds good after 13 years
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|This is a fun app, but not a lot of choices, three Helicopters and three different scenarios, this app has a lot of potential and could be expanded even more.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I was aware of this movie's existence long before I bothered to watch it.  i picked it up for my kid brother, and we sat down on a Friday evening just to watch the first half-hour.  As it happened, not only did we watch the entire film, but so did half of my family!  We were all starstruck by this amazing movie!<br />The Rise of the Guardians is definitely the most advanced and beautifully animated film I have ever seen.  The level of detail and artistic vision in each scene was absolutely incredible, more so when I know just how much painstaking effort goes into making animated films.  Besides the design, the screenwriting was excellent, which says a lot in an age where most animated films are written for young children, and so seem very immature-borderline-idiotic.  But even adults could be entertained by the banter and the dramatic flair in RotG.  Also, the storytelling was flawless--the plot was tidy, the characters smart and winsome, the settings interesting and visionary--the story pacing never lagged and the action flowed smoothly.  Lastly, the voice talent was especially great.  The actors really sold the characters; Chris Pine was brilliant as Jack--he brought so much energy and emotion, and his narration was beautiful.<br />For me, the bright moments were seeing where each character lived and how they traveled (like Santa in the North Pole--love his sleigh!) and watching the comic elves.  Perhaps the first thing to make me laugh was Sandman--to get much-deserved attention--picking up a tiny elf and shaking him to make his hat's little bell ring!  And definitely the best humorous comeback belongs to the Easter Bunny, as the heroes race through the ice tunnels on Santa's sleigh...<br />  Santa (enjoying himself): I hope you like the loop-the-loops!<br />  Bunny (with a death-grip on his seat): *gulp* Hope you like carrots!<br />If you have any appreciation for fun animated films, please give this one screen time at your house.  You will definitely enjoy it.Have fun and believe!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Like most people,  I thought Thrift Shop was a very catchy tune. That was by itself not enough to tempt me to buy the album. I caught a live performance of Same Love on the Colbert Report. I was amazed to hear a pro-equality hip hop song, something I had never heard before. These things coupled with the fact that the album is completely indepently written, produced and distributed, makes it something very unique and amazing. The rest of the songs are good to by the way. =)
B0017HEX76|2.0|I should have spent more for a Fantasia DVD. This Korean made disc has a buzz sound in the background. If I play it loudly it is not very noticeable but at a lower volume it is awful. I tried other discs to make sure that it was not my player, so it can only be a flaw in the disc itself. I probably should send it back.
145210655X|5.0|Got this as a gift (but I cheated and read through a few pages first) - it's perfect for your Star Wars enthusiast who also happens to be a dad.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|Love listening to this music. The best songs IMO are all is hell that ends well, black heart, el dorado, for the win, and sky world. It was worth the buy.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|What a powerful yet sad story...it's still not finished.  Please read this and then dare to be upset with your circumstances.  We Americans are so blessed yet we take so much for granted.  This young man is amazing and strong yet still vulnerable.  I believe time will help his perspective.  Where there is a will there is a way and this story reflects those words.  We seem to live with our heads in the sand...pretty unaware of the everyday horrors going on in our world.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this is a great game and it is hard at the same time plus it is multiplayer too it is top 3 on my stuff
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I got lost reading it.  The names were confusing to me.  Much preferred his two prior books. I was disappointed.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Fabulous slender game, and even better,in my opinion, than the PC game. But don't get it if you get scared very easy. When I got this game I thought that I would cry when I saw him but he did not scare me.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|This album is great music from hitsville!  The duets are screamin' good... Music can never be better! MB's style is fabulous and makes these songs even better than the origonals !Kelly Bowland  is a great addition! You will so enjoy this music. Can't wait for volume 2...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever! I stayed in my bedroom all day reading it.I am getting the next book on my kindle right now.
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|After stumbling on the fact that Suede reunited after 10 years, I couldn't wait to get this album! It's just as great as the old albums....very reminiscent of Dog Man Star.... I can't stop listening to it! A must have for all Suede fans...now, if they would only return to the Boston area for a concert!!!!
B00C0W08XK|4.0|Nice.  Multiple levels.  Ability to enjoy at a fast pace or as slowly as you want.  Worth the minimal price.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is absolutely worth the 6.99 ...get the game while it is still on sale for .99 !! Best game ever....free roam and side missions are amazing...amazing graphics
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|At first Nemo's friends join the reef quickly though the first few levels and the reef expands; you get bonuses frequently. Then rewards become harder to get. The reef stops expanding even when full and you are requested to grow certain plants. You have to sell back part of your reef to accommodate the requested plants. It's clear you have to spend real money to advance in the game. When. I did and bought the special seeds, it kept giving me the same rare plant over and over so I couldn't attract a new fish. That made continuing the game very discouraging.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is such a good book. If I could only read one book than I would choose this one because it's so moving and inspiring! Please read this book is worth the eleven dollars! I even got  two more in hard cover!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A heady mix of mystery, puzzles, secrets and technology. A fun read that had me hooked immediately. Like Neal Stephenson-lite.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|If you like a combination of mystery and hidden object games, then this is the game for you. Full of creepy characters and fun objectives.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It was an interesting style, the interviews, but it prevented me from connecting with any one character. I know that was the point, but I missed having a protagonist to get to know.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool game.....very challenging. I am always looking for games and puzzles that work my brain and this one does just that.
B000IDEQTK|4.0|I am not the biggest helen hunt fan and honestly, her role could have been better cast but over all, I was surprised how good this movie was. There is a little twist, plenty of scandal but some truth as well.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Excellent acting, great writing, completely intriguing and suspenseful.  Television at its best. Looking forward to the next episodes on DVD.
1591845556|5.0|Josh has done it again - synthesized a ridiculously complex field into an incredibly practical, approachable, simple and motivating guide.<br /><br />As a learning junkie, with too many interests and not 'enough' time, my life is full of projects abandoned half-way through Unit Three.<br /><br />I read 20 Hours on a flight and straightaway started making lists and plans.<br /><br />Think of something you would love to learn. Josh is a gentle friend who helps you start in a way that means you'll keep going.<br /><br />If you're looking for a detailed review of the psychology of learning, this is not for you. (Wanting a bunch of theory might by why you're so stalled, by the way...)<br /><br />If you want overexcited cheerleading, also not for you.<br /><br />If you're ready to finally be able to Actually Do That Thing, particularly if That Thing is a physical skill, buy the book, read the book, start.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good puzzles that make you think and plenty of hidden object searches.  Lots of fun.  Another great G5 adventure game!

B002OMZTSU|4.0|I have always like Craig Ferguson on The Late Late Show so picking up this book was kinda a no brainer.  However, I was really surprised about how much he opened up about.  He has certainly led a very complicated (& sometimes sad) life to get where he is today.

B008JFUPK8|2.0|If I disliked certain things about the movie, I absolutely hated the Blu Ray. What destroyed any chance of me enjoying it is that the image is stretched horizontally, so everything is distorted. Everyone has a fat face. Lois's nose is five feet long. Add to that, it is horrendously grainy, shaky, and dark. Everyone has dark patches on their faces as if suffering from some skin disease. Everyone has gigantic pores on their faces.<br /><br />And people are right, this guy is not superman. He is mean-spirited, moody, he is a cold-blooded killing machine.If you can fly and nothing can hurt you, wouldn't you be a bit more chilled and relaxed? The guy in the movie does not bring joy and hope to people, I would be frightened of this guy. He lacks the essence of Superman, he is NOT Superman.<br /><br />To Zack Snyder: no one wants to be tortured by your shaky cam. I will never see another Zack Snyder movie as long as I live. That's a promise.
B00338QENI|5.0|Great writing even when it gets a little technical. Ms Skloot breaks down a complicated subject very well to enable the reader to grasp its impact to the story. Quickly engaging, this book is full of the intellectual and human face of the story.  Well done and highly recommended.
B001EC2J1G|4.0|A Dare good movie to watch. Good acting, and possibly letting you know how Cheap Life will become in the years ahead. One other reason to buy this movie, is its better then 90% of the movies that your going to find on T.V. at this time!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|How cute this is.  This cat talks to you and he is funny.  He purrs and does all kind of funny things.  Nice when you need a cute laugh.  Easy to operate and has a kids mode and adult mode.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Once upon a time every Creedence album(yeah, before there even were CD's) was ripped by Rolling Stone Magazine.  I have to say I mostly agreed with the criticism.  All the songs sounded somewhat the same.  Gradually, however, Creedence or should I say John Fogerty, since he was Creedence, does grow on you.  Now when you take some of these songs and add new singers and arrangements--well it is pretty darn good.  Rock-On John Fogerty!!

030758836X|1.0|The ending of this book was a major disappointment.  Until the ending it was smart and well thought out and thought provoking.  So, I decided to write my own ending and I recommend that those who read this book skip the last two chapters and read my ending - or they can write their own!!<br /><br />Proper ending for Gone Girl:<br /><br />Nick - the last day<br /><br />When the blood test confirmed the pregnancy I knew what had to be done.  When we woke up the next morning I told Amy I had decided that we had to turn the page on all the issues we had piled up over the last two years and that a riverboat cruise from Hannibal would be just the thing to do to start our new life.<br /><br />Amy smiled and seemed quite pleased with the plan.  In fact she was humming as she collected her things for the trip.<br /><br />After arriving at the dock in Hannibal and buying our tickets we boarded the Delta Queen for a day ride up the Mississippi and back - just like the riverboat rides I used to take as a kid in my Huck Finn outfit.  Our cabin for the day was on the top deck with the best view.<br />As the riverboat steamed into the middle of the muddy Mississippi - it's great wheel turning and churning - Amy and I laughed and made small talk about the baby and the perfect life we were about to begin.<br /><br />When our riverboat reached the center of the river and began the turn toward Turtle Island - where it would turn around and return - we casually walked to the railing to get the best view.<br />Without fanfare or warning or even a word, I wrapped my leg around the back of Amy's leg and with a forward thrust propelled us both off the balcony into the deep water.  I held Amy under - pushing her head down every time it appeared she was about to surface.  I began to breathe in the water as well.  As I blacked out - lungs filled with water - I caught one last look at Amy.  She was floating in front of me, hair sprayed out around her, looking like an angel and I'm sure I could see the hint of a smile on her face.<br /><br />Amy-the Last Day<br /><br />Nick thinks I'm excited about the cruise he suggested because I believe he is planning for us to start a new life.  In fact, I know Nick better than he could ever know.<br /><br />I know he's planning to kill me and I'm OK with that.  First of all, and I'll begin one of my famous lists - I do not want a baby - never did.  Secondly, Amazing Amy needs to stay young and beautiful so the world remembers me as the blond, beautiful, perfect heroine.  Lastly but not least, the cloud of suspicion has never totally lifted off of me in regards to my disappearance and the killing of Desi - my death would end the speculation - I would be cleared - my book would explain it all.<br /><br />So, I'm happy to be enjoying my last day on earth with Nick - here on the top deck of the riverboat and now in great Mississippi River - such a tragic death - just the one I was meant to have.<br /><br />Epilogue<br /><br />The bodies of Amy and Nick were found at the mouth of the Mississippi.  They had fallen in at the exact spot that would have allowed them to float unimpeded through the levees and filters - just like on the website Nick had researched on his computer before Amy disappeared!<br /><br />One of their fellow passengers said he saw them falling and it almost appeared that they were diving in rather than falling in - but of course no one thought that could have been the case.<br /><br />Boney and Go sat together at the funeral.  Both stared straight ahead and as the caskets were carried down the aisle for burial, both felt a chill at the same time and shivered.<br /><br />It was over.see the hint of a smile on her face.<br /><br />Amy-the Last Day<br /><br />Nick thinks I'm excited about the cruise he suggested because I believe he is planning for us to start a new life.

B00BDZV9M4|1.0|Lil' Wayne is trash rappin'...If I could I would give this album no stars...I could have done something constructive with my $14, like put it in a shredder and drop it in a lame rapper parade with Lil' Wayne as the Marshall.  For the dude that claims to be the best rapper alive Lil' Wayne's latest project is a complete failure. Well, maybe not a complete failure, but damn near close to it... \\"her birthday suite is her nightgown\\"...I like that, but whoa Wayne you seem to be over compensating homeboy....let that marinate a bit. You know what, I am not here to judge you as a person, but your work has fallen off.  What has happened to the Mix Tape Weezy? I was reluctant to purchase this album, I should have known better.  I was completely disappointed...I gave it two days and put myself through the torture of listening to it again with the hopes that my mind was playing tricks on me. No such luck....look if you want to waste your money then go ahead and cop the album, but it is TRASH, that's my opinion, love it or leave it.<br /><br />PS.  This is the s#it your Grandma calls \\"God Damn Hippydehop!\\"<br /><br />Howie.
B00DBSZ6ZC|2.0|The witches looked stupid. They were too fast as well as the action which made everything seem very choppy. The sets were terrible and cheap. This should have been a kids movie because of all that, but they had too much swearing and blood for it to be a kids movie. And the blood was over the top. Really wish I didn't spend money on renting this.
0345529057|5.0|I'm still making my way through the series, but I love it! The presentation of the box set is also very nice.

B0015HOFZI|4.0|Hi everyone,<br />I am new to the vinyl community and I chose this turntable<br />after buying a jensen all in one turntable here on amazon, don't<br />do it, it was horrendous. I purchased this turntable hoping for the<br />best and I confess I didn't purchase it on amazon but instead from<br />best buy and although they had it at $129 they matched amazons price<br />of $95 so I was appreciative of them.. I digress...<br />I just wanted to let anyone interested in this turntable know that if you're<br />not interested in the usb function (as i was not)I had no trouble hooking<br />it up to my Sony (cheap)soundsystem through the a/v inputs, I don't believe you need a phono pre amp as previously stated, there is a switch in the back of the<br />turntable that is either phono or line, I switched it to line and hooked<br />it up and have had no problems at all without a pre amp, just thought<br />you all would like to know. Sounds great (Jensen was skipping even on<br />clean records)this turntable works great.<br />P.S. If you come across nilsson schmilsson record at the bargain bins, get it,<br />it's my favorite purchase thus far 10/10 for me, love it. It's cheap also.<br />Good luck new vinyl fanatics on your awesome journey.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|I love the cat... he is so cute...but thats all there is to it. it is free, i can see why. my brothers love it! but again... its just a cat repeating other people.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I like the book. It wasn't action backed, it was thoughtful. It follows the lives of some exceptional children after a unique event. The story is well written and compelling. I can definitely recommend it, especially to anyone who is a fan of the Foundation trilogy by Asimov.
B00BSZZA3I|2.0|This case feels cheap, plan and simple. You create the fold in the back as you use it and it causes the case to lose its clean look. Also as you use it on a daily basis the front flap does not stay tight to the screen(when closed), which is not a problem if you only plan on keeping it your pocket or having it out to use, but if you set it on a table screen side up it looks silly. It does help with gripping the devise, especially when texting, but again it does not feel like a quality case in the hand. This type of case design is popular with touch screen products and I would recommend waiting for a cheaper and higher quality product to come onto the market.
0385474547|5.0|A delightful story of how things were in the old days. Full of tradition, back in the days when your word was your bond. A must-read. Un-put-downable, once started !
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Forget comparisons to ancient Sabbath albums. They'll never die and we can all return to them again and again whenever we feel the need. This album definitely stands on its own merit. Even though they're trying to capture that old feeling with tunes like Zeitgeist & End of The Beginning, I have to admit this sounds a lot like an Ozzy solo album. (And that's a bad thing?) Throwing Tony and Geezer into the mix is just an extra added bonus. This is light years ahead of Ozzy's last few albums. After falling off the wagon & rehabbing once again, self-medicating Ozzy is doing some dark soul searching here. I'm going thru some dark times myself. I can relate. I friggin' love these tunes. C'mon! God is Dead? is a Meta-classic. I wanna pump that song into a church on a Sunday morning. OMG the lyrics are pure Ozzy. Sample these lyrics from Peace of Mind (one of my faves):<br /><br />I wish somebody would empty my head<br />I am so sorry for the things that I've said<br />This hopeless feeling that's living inside<br />I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find... some peace of mind<br /><br />Does it get any sadder than this? This album is full of Ozzy's despair. I feel your pain, brother. I'm hearing voices in my head too.<br /><br />Yeah, the levels are a little high. I just turned my bass & treble setting to 0 and cranked the volume. This ROCKS! Period. The BEST straight-up metal album I've heard in years. It was worth the wait & I'm THANKFUL!... Everyone else can continue trolling and complaining. I'll be BLAZING UP & ROCKING this album for years to come. And I'm as old as grave dust. Haha.<br /><br />Ozzy album? Sabbath album?... whatever. It's WICKED GOOD! (Get the Deluxe at BB with the bonus track.)<br /><br />GET WELL, Tony! STAY SANE, Ozzy! Stick to the \\"sweet leaf\\" & stay away from snorting those ants, man. lol. I LOVE YOU GUYS!<br /><br />P.S. Taylor Swift should start dating Ozzy because this album is climbing to No. 1 on the Billboard charts.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I really love this game, please add me for Gameloft games, I have no contacts/friends. :(<br /><br />The graphics are very nice, and having special moves when you double-tap an animal is an entertaining touch. I enjoy completing my families and just watching them for a while. Upgrading isn't terribly taxing until they start getting over 50k, so expanding is pretty easy for a good long while.<br /><br />It would be really great to get a peanut or two when levelling up, and for some quests more often, cuz it's a recession you know. For those of us on fixed incomes, buying peanuts isn't a really feasible idea. And charging hundreds of peanuts for one animal just ain't gonna cut it. Especially when you need TWO to finish the family.<br /><br />I also have a beef with searching for the higher animals. Even filling the friend slots using earned peanuts, I found absolutely NO improvement in finding or capturing the animal. I invariably spend more than half my fuel to find it, and once the animal runs, it's over unless you want to waste peanuts on more fuel, with little chance of both finding and capturing it. I once spent approximately 6x the animal's worth just to snag the first one. Really ticked me off.<br /><br />BIGGEST COMPLAINT!!!!!<br /><br />Gameloft REALLY needs to help their players connect. I have tons of FB friends but they don't do tablet games, so I have zero friends for this &quot;social networking game&quot;. Other games I play give you the ability to visit random zoos and leave your ID with a request to friend each other. A great help!!! A other one I play will give you a list of recommended players to send friend requests to. LIFESAVER!!!<br /><br />Gameloft appears to expect you to actually get your personal, local friends to be your entire possible friend pool. I might be insane, but I was under the impression that games like this were supposed to help you reach out to players all over the world. How am I supposed to do that with no help from Gameloft to find people who actually play the same game(s) I do?!<br /><br />Seriously Gameloft, ADDRESS THIS ISSUE PLEASE!<br /><br />I play a number of Gameloft games and it would help me TREMENDOUSLY to actually get friend zoos to visit.<br /><br />But I still love this game. &gt;.&gt;to find people who actually play the same game(s) I do?!<br /><br />Seriously Gameloft, ADDRESS THIS ISSUE PLEASE!<br /><br />I play a number of Gameloft games and it would help me TREMENDOUSLY to actually get friend zoos to visit.<br /><br />But I still love this game. &gt;.&gt;

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really love this game, the graphics are spot on and very fun to watch. I never saw the movies but now I want to. LOL<br /><br />I wish the acorn prices were lower, but it is nice to occasionally be able to find one randomly. :)<br /><br />COMPLAINT TIME:<br /><br />THE PREHISTORIC AREA IS A SHAMELESS MONEY SUCK-BEWARE!<br /><br />I saved up over 300 acorns (325 I think) and excitedly opened up the prehistoric area... entering with a grin on my face and victory in my heart. I immediately brought up the shop to see what magnificent new beasts I would fill my new world with....  And my joy turned to bitter anger as I saw dino after dino after dino priced for acorns... acorns... hundreds of acorns. Some luck with Scrat left me with some spare, so I picked up a little cheap one. Though you obviously have to multiply each dino's cost by 4 if you ever aspire to completing families.<br /><br />Others can be bought with friend hearts. LOTS of them. It can exceed 1,000 for just one. I scraped together enough to buy one of the cheapest.<br /><br />Lastly, a FEW can be had with simple coins, as 'few' as one million. Which is the only one I could afford. 15 and 25 million will also be necessary if you want those dinos. So my wonderful, hard-earned new prehistoric world has only 3 inhabitants.<br /><br />Wish I'd never wasted the acorns to open it up. >:[<br /><br />Also, Gameloft SERIOUSLY needs to help you find other players to befriend, it's very hard to get one for me. I actually managed to get 2 friends through FB, but when I try to visit the 2nd one it keeps telling me that I can't visit anymore \\"random\\" zoos that day. What?! It's a FB friend, has their name and all, that's not a \\"random\\" zoo. Getting to visit random zoos is very helpful, but not when it's glitchy.<br /><br />I have games that offer me names/zoos to add because they are active and good choices. Others that list recommendations for sending friend requests. Gameloft needs to implement measures to help players across the world find others who also need friend help in the same game(s). If they get that taken care of, their games will really take off in the connection aspect. :)across the world find others who also need friend help in the same game(s).

0312330855|4.0|A collection of wonderful four-legged (and a few with two) friend stories strung together by a Scottish vet's great prose and endearing persona. Anyone who has loved any animal, will connect with this book. It has tears of joy and sadness, humor, love and painted imagery and sounds of the 1930s English country-side. In a word - pathos. Another- emotive. Despite its simplicity - be ready for a few laugh-out-loud moments ( I refuse to say LOL), like cleaning a window with a chicken, quite a few sentences that have to be re-read, to understand the thick written brogue and keep a tissue or two handy. Be sure to collect a few phrases to add to your everyday vernacular.<br /><br />http://oddsandhens.wordpress.com/2013/05/04/reach-read-all-creatures-great-and-small/

B00371XIJE|5.0|While I will sit through some borderline dog movies and not want two hours of my life back, this movie was great for a sappy dog movie.  I am a huge dog lover, and other then some questionable things done in the movie, it was a great adaptation of a true story.  I almost had to stop the movie a few times because i was crying so hard, and I can't remember the last time a movie made me do that.

I loved the characters and the way the story was told from Drews perspective.  He is so witty,funny and determined.  She was a warm modern heroine in this book.  Very refreshing.

I was beyond disappointed. I thought this was a 3 part series and was super excited to read the fianl book.

0425263924|3.0|Ugh, this book was so frustrating. A lot of circles, unanswered questions, then more (new) problems, and even more unanswered questions. Not to mention she ended the book the same way she did the 1st one, as if it was the end of a chapter.<br /><br />Seriously, I'm sort of angry with this book. All of the previous issues could have been resolved and done in the one, and there really was no reason to add more except to keep writing and selling more books. I have no problem with the writing and selling of books, it's just we don't need a story that could be told in 2 books dragged out into 3 never mind 5.<br /><br />Very few good things happened in this book and, as always, every time things were looking up, shit rained on them in torrents. I felt a lot of aggravation while reading this, and I understand that it was part of setting the mood and the story itself, but it was all left unresolved. Each book should feel resolved in a way, yeah, there are going to be plots that will need to continue throughout the series, but to leave everyone of them open. NO!<br /><br />And does every woman in the world that sees Gideon want him so badly they can't live without him. It's a bit much, if ya ask me. Although, I love Gideon. Love how much he needs Eva and how much he does for her.<br /><br />And honestly, the only reason I got past book 1 was morbid curiosity. I hate knowing there's more to a story I've started. I can't NOT finish it.<br /><br />I recommend this book for suckers like me that have to read a whole series even though it's annoying. Well, and for those who LOVE a great love connection. There are some great qualities in this book/series, read my review of the second book Reflected in You. There you'll see the wonderful things that have intrigued me enough to continue to read these books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book a five star rating because, of how Suzanne Collins wrote the book. To me it gives you a mind movie of what it would look like in Katniss`s shoes. She is a very good writer I look forward to the third book!
B00BZBPRBA|5.0|Matilda is a classic. who doesn't love this movie?  Great cast. Sweet story of finding people who can reflect back to you who you are and the joy that ensues.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this book from the Amazon Lending Library, but I found the story to be more engaging than I'd expected. The book is clearly written for young adults, but it was pretty easy to look past that. While the prose could be awkward and the story superficial, I still found  the main characters sympathetic and engaging. If you're looking for a quick, entertaining read from the lending l library, I'd recommend this book.
B009JZWWGC|5.0|I am a long time Star Trek fan and so I follow where most have not gone before when ever a film is released.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As the second book of hunger games, catching fire continues the fun run through the dystopia of panem.  I enjoyed the expansion of what happens in the politics of those who fight to stay alive in a world that does not respect human life.  Good read and worthy book two of hunger games.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Meryl Streep did an absolutely marvelous job in portraying PM Thatcher.  I am very glad I got and will watch more
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo on my kindle fire. It's easier to play it on here than on my laptop. it seems like a game that was meant for the kindle fire.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I wonderful old classic very kid friendly for 6 yr and up.  Must see this movie and show each generation
B008JGSM6G|4.0|love it. So much fun my family and I love it so much it id very challenging and entertaining for everyone.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Definitely a must see movie.  A good family (all ages) movie that will keep the interest of all who watch
B005EHQGTS|4.0|This app is great for accessing your PC from a tablet, or even from another PC. I highly recommend it.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Having only recently finally gotten around to Pride & Prejudice I was so enthralled with Miss Austen 's writing that I had to have more.  This wonderful story is number two, and I shall be soon reading all she has written. Loved this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very interesting and I hope to read it again now before I go I want to thank the author for writing the book and to make even more of this series forever and ever and for eternity
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This 1982 comedy tells the story of a talented but volatile actor whose reputation for causing problems has made it impossible for him to get a job. Dustin Hoffman decides to audition for the role of a woman as a way of getting around his reputation; he'd been helping Terri Garr prepare for this particular role, but she hadn't had any success. Hoffman predictably gets himself into several difficult situations as a result, but ends up doing well at the end.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|when is the 4th chronicle being released.? what a mixed up story can't wait to fin dout the final conclusion
B007IXWKUK|5.0|from book one to the next and onto the next you cant put the books down! Not for the closed minded. Have open mind
B00006JL1Z|5.0|One of the best groups of all time performing all their classic chart topping hits. A no brainer to own this music
B007J4T2G8|5.0|you are taken into the story<br />you are so curious as to whats going to happen next, you do not stop reading<br />i read this series of books in less than a weeks time, they are that good.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Another great movie from Quentin T.  Really wish they've NOT shown as much of the dog attacking the slave scene very hard to watch.  Loved the music, especially theme from &#34;They Call me Trinity&#34; at the end...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this is a good wrap up to the series, even tho i would have loved to of continued reading the story into the final prolog...<br />I would love to read more books by this writer<br />you can not put this series down
B0061C1NQ6|4.0|This is the beginning of the Renko novels.  I always enjoy this one the most and re-read it at every opportunity.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|Even though I would not call myself a fan of Stallone or Snipes, I really like this movie, I am a fan of Bullock though. This movie is just a lot of fun for me! The humor in it, it just connects with me, I find myself laughing every time I watch it.  The action isn't overdone, just about the right amount and it's not all CG which can distract me. Also it's interesting to see someone's take on the future and just laugh at it.  Anyway I hope the future isn't this!
0439023521|5.0|My better half turned me on to this trilogy. A well written book with a tight futuristic story line that appeals to more than teenagers and young adults.  Told in first person, the protagonist comes to life from the opening pages and we cheer her on. 03-2012
1558908846|5.0|LOVE this movie! I have never read the comics so I have no idea how &#34;true&#34; it is, but I just LOVE this movie.  I would not call myself a &#34;fan&#34; of Stallone, but I do really like Diane Lane and love her in this too.  It's so cool to see Lane as a kick butt Judge in this, I just wish she had a bigger part, even though it would rival Stallone's.  I do love Stallone in this, I would even admit it's the best he has ever looked to me and I like his acting, even if it is a similar character to John Spartan in Demolition Man, it's just a good fit for him. Kind of like how Bruce Willis plays a great cop.  Like Demolition Man the action and humor just hit me right at the right level, not too much and not too little.
0307949486|5.0|This is really two interwoven stories in one book...a well written mystery fiction with attention to details. Michael Blomkvist is likable but it is Lisbeth Salander that we root for. 04-2012
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I will just say I love this show! I don't have a favorite character, but I do have a least favorite, Joffrey, he drives me up the wall. When I found out in &#34;real life&#34; he's 20yrs old I was surprised. He is a good actor and he does his character justice, making him evil and easy to hate (for me), but I just can't stand him! LOL! This show has a great cast and writing. I tried reading the books but could not, it was too much for me, even an avid reader, too many characters and places and I had trouble keeping track of and understanding everything. I was so glad they made it into a series because I wanted to learn and see what this story was about.
0307949508|5.0|Enjoyed it even more than the first book.  Great plot and characters. Lisbeth utters the perfect line at the end. Like Mankell, his attention to details brings the story to life. 06-2012
630469654X|5.0|The acting isn't that great I will admit that, but I still love this movie. I couldn't even tell you exactly what it is, maybe the battle between the priest and the knight and the lady and the eventual win... I don't know I just like it!  Wish I could say more, but I just love this movie.
0307454568|5.0|With so many reviews, there's not much more to say. A terrific finale to the trilogy.  Great pacing and details. It's a shame Larsson died at a relatively young age. 07-2012
B007712XAU|5.0|Got these DVD's as a birthday gift for my dad.  He loves any type of British show.  The first time he sat down to watch, my mom watched with him...and now she's hooked.  They're watching episode after episode and will probably soon be looking for the next season on DVD.
0345533054|5.0|So many twists your head spins. Another fine page turner. What makes these books enjoyable for me are the cultural references and the locality of New Jersey. 05-2013
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great book and beautifully written.  Couldn't put it down.  Finsished in three days.  Could have gone on forever.  Much history intwinned with stories about the people.
B00797MB0O|5.0|This woman can act!  Her range and abilities are fabulous.  One really finds her distasteful in this movie but wow, what a great display of how not to raise a kid to make them turn out to be a spoiled brat adult without a clue!
B00821PCJS|4.0|It is different!  I like the scifi and also good strong acting.  There's a community story, and a lot of motion to the plot.  It's suspenseful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I hope this app will have  many happy people talking about how great it is!<br />Good luck on making this the best horse app on the kindle fire!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Will, I love, love,love the game, but I which I could get everything free. Either than that it is lovely. How do you get the full version, anyways?
B003L77G6A|5.0|It is The Big Bang Theory.  How much more could a person ask for?  Packaging is great and the DVD is superb.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love using this mouse. The mouse responds really well and fits in my hand perfectly without any discomfort. It's also very aesthetically appealing to look at with its light blue glowing light and I love the weight tuning, makes for perfect handling every time!
0763644765|5.0|This book is about a little kid who realizes he needs to pee.  He considers what animals do (kitty uses a litter box, while doggy pees in the yard), and debates what he should do himself. Should he go in his diaper, as he has in the past?  Or should he try to use the potty this time?  He decides to give it a go on the potty.  After sitting patiently for a long time, he is finally successful.  His mommy and daddy are excited, and presumably they live happily ever after, etc.<br /><br />As a parent, I liked that this is a very child-centered book.  It is not about parents trying to potty-train a child.  It is about a child making deciding for himself that he would like to use the potty, working through the idea, giving it a try, struggling, and ultimately succeeding.  The parents are only shown at the very end of the book, celebrating the child's success.<br /><br />This book is simple, colorful, and fun.  It addresses many concerns relevant to a child, including:<br />-Deciding whether to use diapers vs. potty<br />-Boredom associated with sitting on the potty while waiting for the pee or poop to come out.<br />-Humor.  The child initially sits down on the potty with his diaper still on, then remembers to take it off.  A toddler who has been introduced to how the potty works will be amused by this rookie mistake.<br />-More humor.  The child dozes off on the potty, only to be awakened by the noises &#34;Tinkle, tinkle, TOOT!&#34; as his pee and poop comes out.  If you are 2 years old, this is hysterical.<br />-The eventual milestone of getting to wear big-kid underpants<br /><br />RECOMMENDED AGE RANGE: 1-2 years. Due to it's simplicity and the baby-like appearance of the protagonist, this is great book for younger potty-trainers.  For a child who is late to training (age 3), other books like Joanna Cole's &#34;My Big Boy Potty&#34; / &#34;My Big Girl Potty&#34; would be more appropriate.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|It works.. and I like the lights telling me I am transitioning data. compact too. Would like to have a elbow or dual connector but that's not its fault.
B009NY43NY|5.0|loved it but sad its done, hopefully not...there is not a doubt that more books could follow, I have faith...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! I have always wanted to own a horse but can't and this app simulates it perfectly.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Movie works great no scratches. This movie is super funny it was a must buy for me! This movie was in perfect condition!
0802473164|5.0|I learned a few things you seem to be blind sided by in every day life, I just have to et her to read now if she will.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun way to spend some idle time. Different vehicles and maps keep the activity going for hours on end. Hard to put down.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game so much, even without the extra dresses. It's a fun interactive game that I can play for hours. I also suggest their other two games like this: the prom version and wedding version. (:
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game for kids and wanna be horse owners very interactive<br />And cute I could play for hours every day super great game
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Great songs, great music!!! Makes for a long drive! Amazingly enough, I could listen to thus CD over and over again and never get tired of it!
B004PJG7MW|4.0|A bit clunky in spots but after all these years I still love it and was pleased to be part of its creation.
B00D8RYV52|1.0|Doesn't work on either one of my Samsung Galaxies. I nor my kids are amused. So did I spend .99 on nothing?
B005N09L5C|2.0|what a boring movie.  However there are many couples in the here and now coupling to create more disasters for the light hearted to wrestle with when their off spring reach the adult side of puberty. Mind control in the most dull and boring sense.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|great game.  no real money needed.  easy to play.  especially for free.  it is a nice way to pass some time.
B00APUQPX6|3.0|Shows the reason why sometimes part two is enough.  Could just be me but It didn't work on a story line I loved
B007SGM084|5.0|Good story plot. That's what kept me going. Luv it luv it luv it!<br /><br />Loved their email exchanges. Would like to read it again.
0307155102|5.0|My kids really enjoy the Richard scary books. They are a childhood must. Who doesn't like looking for gold bug?
0763644765|5.0|After purchasing 3 books for the potty training phase, this one is definitely our little darling's favorite!  She has memorized the pages already and loves it!  The sturdy pages hold up well with little hands.
0394818237|5.0|Richard Scary books are always super fun for kids. So so much to look at and always a great read.
B005OK721G|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies I can watch over and over again.  I have purchased many many movies and CD's from this one seller Go Hasting and every purchase has been in perfect condition I mean perfect.  Some still in plastic never opened.  It good to know when you can find someone with good quality items.  A very happy customer.
B00D8RYV52|1.0|June 15, 2013 - not much else to say.  The game either force-closes before it loads, or hangs at title.  While I understand the inherent problems of Android fragmentation, if you release an app on the Amazon app store, you should probably test it on the only three tablets they sell.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I am gonna keep this short and sweet so I don't lose you. I don't know why so many people hated this movie. Yeah I will admit the ending didnt please me to much. It would have if I knew it was the end of iron man but I know he will be in the avengers 2. And maybe another ironman movie. It was a really enjoyable movie. It did what I was expecting an ironman movie to do. Make me laugh (Funniest ironman movie yet). Had some great action. And brought back my favorite super hero and actor. The one thing that did disappoint me though is that their wasn't one ac/dc song in this.And one last thing I want to say to close. Bandwagon mandarin fans. Get over it!!!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app reads and searches from within on My kindle fire hd and on my galaxy s3. Product works well.
B008CRC506|5.0|Too bad about Season 2 -- in my humble opinion it digressed and the storyline got jumbled and messed up.  Season 1 was so very enjoyable.  The music is great.  The original songs are beautiful and smart.  The other songs like &#34;I Am Beautiful&#34; which Katherine McPhee sang at her audition, was enthralling.  She has such a powerful voice!  And I loved the way they would blur the images and go to an imagined scene.  The ones where Derek saw Katherine McPhee as Marilyn were my favorites.  My hope is that a different network picks it up and runs with it next season and fixes the messes created in Season 2.  If not, I will miss it.  It will probably be replaced at NBC with another reality show -- just what we need!  NOT.
B00CFYD682|5.0|This cd was even better than I could have dreamed it could have been. She has never sounded better and after the last 2 cd, Voice, and The Turn that were dull and not up to her talent. I have alway hoped that she would return to the sound of Yaz that made her a singer. And now after all these years, its so right and done so well. It has it all, synth-pop. strings, icy eletronics R&B, and soul. I love all the songs, my favs the Bjork like Horizon Flame, the yaz like Filgree also the danceable Love Reign Surpreme and the pop Right as rain, to the dark and icy sound of Rung by the tide. What make Alisons sound so special is her soulful voice and the pop-synth sound. its magic. Its what she dose best. I would love to hear Vince Clark and Alison write and do a whole cd together. I have been playing this cd every day , I just love it. I hope she stays on this path. I was hoping she would go back to what made her a great singer. I hope for more like this. ALISON IS BACK. thanks for the best cd is years. also to all the great producers of the cd Bravo. I want more, maybe some rimixes??
0061950726|4.0|My grandmother came to Texas on one of the orphan trains. She was also of Irish descendent. Her birth family kept track of her, sent money for Catholic school and such. There were Protestant and Catholic trains. When the train arrived in Texas, another little girl would not let go of my Grandmother and the family adopted both of them. That was my great-Aunt Tracy. The book made me think of my Grandmother and how lucky we were to have her for 99 years. She lived a long, Catholic life with 8 children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Keeps you constantly guessing. Enjoyed the narrator. Makes you feel good to be fooling the &#34;good guys&#34; that are so cocky.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really good game game and I would recommend  it to anyone who enjoys temple run style games.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|This was bought as a gift for a friend.  She had been searching all over and asking friends to burn a copy for her.  She has no computer so she is unable to access Amazon.  She cried when she opened the gift and hugged me.  She plays it over and over and has requested &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; single be played at her funeral!
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|I don't expect Hans Zimmer to be John Williams, no more than I want Zack Snyder to be Richard Donner.  However, I do expect a better than average comic book film after over 5 years of development and after exceptional ones like IRON MAN and X-MEN 2 have paved the way.  Unfortunately, we get a humor-less, haphazardly paced movie like MAN OF STEEL to reboot Superman and a score has one or two good moments, but nothing else.  At least Brian Tyler gave us a rousing score to the far superior IRON MAN 3 which lifted the audiences spirits and got them involved in the action.  All Zimmer does is repeat, rinse, lather, and repeat again.  I tried to pick up something memorable while watching MAN OF STEEL and in the end, didn't care.  I know that the filmmakers want to distance themselves from the original movies as well as SUPERMAN RETURNS but that doesn't mean they couldn't have produced something with a melody somewhere.<br /><br />The score does work better in the movie, but that's because it's all just a bunch of background noise. This score doesn't even match the work John Ottman did for SUPERMAN RETURNS (a more involving movie than MoS, by the way).  Hearing something like this almost makes me yearn for a plagiarist like James Horner.  Almost.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|really fun game and a really free one at that.  rack up points on the highway or moon and the upgrades are legit too
B00000FZQ8|5.0|Very much a sleeper movie.  It is a cautionary tale about wasting what is a truly valuable resource.  It is of course an impossibility now as we know so much more about Global Warming then we use too.  But it still makes one think about who is making the big desicions and should we have more transparency all the way to the top of government.
0062082353|5.0|This book is well written, and is an easy read. I have not been able to put it down since reading the first page...really grabs your attention.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|One of the best Movies out there on a futuristic Utopian society.  Lots of twists and turns.  Who's side is Logan on?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book of the series, is even better than the first, if that is possible. Enjoy it all of you. You will love it too.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great game but I wish you can be on  ground but  can't be on ground I love this
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app makes it easier to connect to my Facebook account from my Kindle. Love the easy access to my friends.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Teenagers dying of cancer- so sad and yet this author provides an entertaining tale of love and courage.  As a hospice volunteer, I thought I knew something of dying.  But this book made me really understand what it might feel like to be that ill.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Great book.  John Grisham continues to write great books and this is one in a series of great books.  Can't wait for the next installment.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|It delivers on all fronts. We knew it would and it does. 2 parts... sigh. ok I'll wait another year.
0374203032|3.0|Author provides plenty of examples of market dynamics in operation where they don't belong - but doesn't, in my opinion, go any further.  There is a wrap up of ideas, but no recommendations on how to correct the issue.
B00B769XB8|4.0|I'll be up front and honest. This isn't a good movie. It's the type of movie that you invite your friends over, have a few drinks, and mock mercilessly. However, that's part of the charm. I know this movie isn't good, but I still can't help but like it. It's dumb, mostly nonsensical, and ridiculously gory (or rather, full of gore that's ridiculous). That being said, I watched this movie twice in the theater and ordered the 3D version so that I can own my own copy to view at my leisure. Speaking of 3D, it's not bad or offensive, like many 3D releases. It definitely adds to the cheese factor with sprays of blood, chunks of flesh, and general silliness. Grab a (strong) drink and toss this movie in. It's a blast.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was a good book, definitely kept my attention. Makes me wonder what is really going on \\"out there\\". Would love to read a Book Two to see how their future turns out!
1594136467|5.0|The author's experience is believable and comforting to many. I have always been interested in the question: &#34;Why are we here and what happens after physical death.&#34; Information about this topic is available from many sources, and I am a believer.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am in love with this game and I am not a little kid!!!<br />So I suggest you get this game for your little girl or even your little boy!!!
0143039431|5.0|I loved the story because it was so much like my family's their long hard trip to Bakersfield Ca.  My mom, pregnant with me, dad, 3 young girls and my Grandparents brought their few possessions in a touring car in the fall of 1934.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It is just an Icon to the facebook mobile website. I could've made one of those myself. Just wastes space in my kindle fire.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was prepared not to like this book club selection, but was drawn in almost immediately.  I fell in love with the story teller.....and the relationships that were developed throughout the story.  Emotional and enjoyable read.
B00BF11STU|3.0|They managed to take a riveting, fascinating real-life story and make it rather boring.  This one is more hype than anything else.  Watch Argo instead.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Easy to read, interesting, enjoyable but very thought-provoking. Does a great job explaining habits and how to change them. Goes deep but understandable.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Really truly amazing. I could start right back on page 1 now. I can't think of three other books that I could say that about having just finished them.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I skipped John Carter when it came out theatrically because of the bad reviews.  Finally watched it on home video and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Great action-adventure sci-fi/fantasy.  Amazing production design and visual effects, epic story from Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Would love to see a sequel.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I have always been enthralled with anything about Henry the Eighth and this was a different look at Henry and Katherine and Anne.  Stayed up until 2 a.m. watching multiple episodes.
1878424319|5.0|I have read this book many times and given many copies to friends.  The agreements themselves are fine, though I categorize core values and behaviors a bit differently.  What I truly loved about the book was the material leading up to and supporting the agreements.  From the very first pages where Smokey Mirror discovers he is made of light, everything is made of light and the space in-between isn't empty, I was captivated.  This brought to mind the on-going scenario of how the ancients were wise beyond recognition.  Current String Theory and Dark Matter/Dark Energy hypothesis  in Quantum Physics confirms these statements.  Ruiz'z discussion on auto domestication of humans is compelling and powerful.  The whole book is filled with these gems if one slows down and takes the time to read thoroughly, and not just to find out what the agreements are.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Puzzles progress in difficulty of thought processes, but never become &quot;impossible&quot;.  The next steps are visible if not apparent, which is the fun part of the game.  Once you identify the next challenge you think &quot;of course&quot;!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Nothing happened in the story, non stop sex........is this a way to get me to buy another book? I think not.
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|This is R.E.M. after they already became mainstream (DOCUMENT) while making a smooth transition onto a major label (WB).<br /><br />This is an interesting album to me because they still maintained their college rock, underground creativity while embracing their ever growing mainstream audience, YET they hadn't morphed into their superstar (a la U2) status just yet.  The next album, OUT OF TIME, solidified their world domination status.<br /><br />GREEN:  25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition is just as revealing and satisfying as all the other anniversary editions that came before it.  The live concert CD is maybe even better than the others in that R.E.M. were true concert veterans at this point and the set list is just as tight as it gets.  Also, GREEN was my favorite tour because my fascination with them was at its peak.  I saw the show twice in a one week period in two major cities (Philadelphia and Washington, DC), AND I got to meet the band after the DC show.  (Side note:  the only bad part of this experience is that Michael Stipe was the only band member who refused to give me his autograph.  I think he was feeling his oats at this point (arrogance? scared?).<br /><br />Whatever, I remain a fan to this day and I am in love with this edition of GREEN.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|Based on the trailer we were a little skeptical about watching this with our five- and eight-year-old boys. However, we're really glad we did! The action is fantastic. The message is usual (typical hero's journey), but the addition of a princess who can speak and act for herself was a pleasure. Yes, there is giant-eating-human action, but the scenes are cut almost perfectly. You don't see the humans being eaten, and the gore is minimal (e.g., not bloody). There is a lot of violence--this is a fight for mankind against amazingly animated giants, for goodness's sake!--but kids (and parents) who have seen Star Wars, LOTR, or any fantasy films with epic battles should be a-OK with _Jack_. I'm glad we bought this on digital, and am sure the boys will be playing \\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" for days on end.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|J. J. Abrams is a genius.  I never thought STAR TREK could ever be this good or COOL...and I'm a STAR TREK fan!  One of the most action packed sci-fi films ever made...until of course, INTO DARKNESS.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|When I heard Hans Zimmer had been tapped to score \\"Man of Steel\\", I felt a thrill of excitement. Then it struck me: his style is so different from John Williams, whose Superman theme has reigned supreme for 35 years ... how would he use that theme and weave it in to his work? As a man who grew up on the Christopher Reeve/Richard Donner films featuring the Williams fanfare, I could not picture a Superman film without that music. Then I heard that Zimmer planned to come up with an entirely new score, and that he would not re-use the Williams theme. I was horrified. What would Superman be without the Williams theme?<br /><br />Then I took a deep breath, and decided to proceed with an open mind.<br /><br />The first tease of the new theme came with the release of the third trailer for the film, with a cut-down version of Track 17 on Disc 1 of the Special Edition Release, \\"What Are You Going To Do When You Are Not Saving The World?\\" I was breathless on the first listen. I must have worn a hole in my internet listening to that over and over again. Then, last Tuesday, the disc arrived and I eagerly tore it open to have my first straight-through listen.<br /><br />The score is absolutely fantastic, and (having seen the movie now) I can say it fits the new film perfectly. It has both quiet, emotional passages (such as that solo on The Artot-Alard Stradivarius violin played by Ann Marie Calhoun, or the female solo vocals performed by Hilda Orvarsdottir) and thunderous percussion and electric guitar stretches performed by some of he most famous percussionists and drummers in the music industry. My favorite action track may be \\"What Are You Going To Do When You Are Not Saving The World?\\" (the full theme and fanfare from the third trailer) ... but two close contenders would be \\"Terraforming\\" and \\"I Will Find Him.\\" At the other end of the spectrum, \\"Goodbye, My Son\\" is breathtakingly quiet and sad. Zimmer's full-spectrum of talent is well on display here.<br /><br />I still lovethe Williams music for the 1978 film; but we live in a different era, and this is a film - and thus a score - for 2013. The decision to start fresh for this reboot was counter-intuitive; it's sure to be scoffed at by Williams purists ranting through their emotional uproar (as I almost did until I got a hold of myself)... Yet it turned out to be 100% correct. Incredibly (considering 35 years of emotional attachment to Williams' score) Zimmer pulled it off for me. In the scene where Clark is raising the bus (alluded to in the trailer, so not a spoiler), the appearance of the new theme in all its glory was as electrifying as the Williams theme always was in such moments.<br /><br />Make sure to get the two-disc special edition set, as the extra bonus tracks on Disc 2 are not to be missed.<br /><br />6 our of 5 stars, 12 out of 10. Congratulations on a job well done, Mr. Zimmer!<br /><br />UPDATE: Track 2, \\"Oil Rig,\\" contains an unusual \\"Uh-oh\\" sound. Today, Watertower Music released the story behind it: it turns out that Zack Snyder (the Director) carried his daughter, on his shoulders, onto the scoring-stage. She was watching, fascinated, and when the conductor (Nick Glennie-Smith) raised his arms over his head to give the downbeat, she exclaimed: \\"Uh-oh!\\" The microphones picked it up and they decided to keep it.
B00BR9XS98|1.0|The picture and description of the book you purchase aren't the same thing.  I can understand it's highly unlikely that a signed first edition book from George R.R. Martin will be less than 250 dollars,  but to put first edition in the title,  and not send the consumer a first edition, is unethical.  I will not make another purchase from this company.

0375850864|5.0|This was the Newbery Winner, and well deserved.  As an adult, I read this for content because I am using this with my tutoring students.  There are so many layers to the book, and a time travel mystery anchors the plot.  I do remember the $20,00 Pyramid Game Show, and the author does a deft job of weaving this sub-plot through the book, while handling important topics of friendship, judging on first impressions, kindness towards strangers and coming of age.  By the end, there is a great deal of satisfaction in the completeness of how the storylines connect and resolve.  You will love it as much as the kids!
B002GJU54E|5.0|I LOVE ALL THE STEPHANIE PLUM BOOKS.  JANET EVANOVICH HAS A GREAT SENSE OF<br />HUMOR.  SHE DOESN'T LOAD UP HER STORIES WITH ALL KINDS OF SEX WHICH IS NOT<br />NECESSARY TO TELL A STORY.  I RECOMMEND ALL HER BOOKS.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|Asked to give this book a grade, all of my Book Club fellow friends intensely disliked the long winded sentences and the redundant plot.  Grades from D to C were the conclusion of 12 who read and finished the book- not because the author wanted a little victory, but because the members of this Book Club feel an obligation to the other members.  Many felt that certain plot devices were gimmicks because the plot introduced the topic and promptly dropped it within two paragraphs.  Myself, I had to give this book an &#34;Incomplete&#34; because I didn't finish even half.  I was hoping that the early part of the plot, told from different angles but by the same narrator, was a writing style sure to have purpose.  It didn't.<br /><br />Life is too short to keep reading what is not appealing, and doesn't get better by completing.

B0084TWN9K|2.0|I did not care for these short stories and did not finish the book.  Too dark.  Too depressing.  Not my style.  I read this book because I have read a couple of Alice Munro's books and loved them, and was fascinated by the idea of short stories by this author.  Oh well...

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Our family loves this movie.  A definite must for the family DVD library!  It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and never tire of!
B0015ABRE2|3.0|This seasons was disappointing. Michael C Halls portrayal of Dexter is probually the only reason I stuck with it. I am so glad I did! The next seasons are probually some of the best writing and directing I've ever seen. So whatever you do, if you like it, or hate it, STICK WITH IT.

B00AB65SVE|1.0|Now, I'm going to admit I thought the show was pretty funny when it first came on. But midway through the fist season, the child actors started to get on my nerves, they wernt acting like kids, they were acting like snotty adults. I stopped watching for a while, then I caught a couple reruns on USA Network, the new baby is just awful and annoying. And one thing that bothers me is that they completely ignore the cameras. I know they aren't suppose to act like the cameras are around in a documentary, but its not like a movie theater will allow a camera crew in a movie theater with copyrighted stuff in it? just come on
B004JN1D2I|5.0|\\"Game of Thrones: Not Only for the Hipsters\\"<br /><br />One of the biggest things to hit the television screens in the past few years is \\"Game of Thrones.\\"  This has captured audiences and kept them glued to the proverbial boob tube on Sunday nights.  Many moons before some producer decided to bring it to the small screen, George R. R. Martin had put his imagination to paper.  With his own style, Martin was able to bring in corruption, adultery, greed, war, loss and even some dragons.<br /><br />The first thing that really needs to be noted is Martin's writing style.  Each chapter is based off of a single character.  This makes it easier to get to know each character and how they interact and feel towards other characters.  The one thing that can become confusing is the flow of time.  One chapter may go for many days or even months and then when the next chapter comes along the reader is taken back in time even further than the previous chapter had started.  It makes it very interesting, especially when you want to read about a certain character may have to wait three or five or ten chapters before you get to read about them again.<br /><br />A major theme in Martin's books is adultery.  He does a superb job of making the story flow and the characters grow that the reader may start to doubt their own thoughts on the matter.  He does a good job of making the reader decide how important their extramarital affairs play in whether they will be liked or despised.  If a character does everything that is considered to be heroic, but decides to sleep outside his own bed and even have bastard children, which is more important, their heroic actions or cheating on their wife?  He intertwines differences in all characters.  Not all of them cheat and those that do are mixed between the classical good guys and bad guys.<br /><br />Corruption runs rapid in Martin's fabled lands.  It almost seems that it is corruption that is the glue that keeps everything together.  He shows its evil head from the lowliest low to the kings.  He shows what type of impact corruption has not only on the corrupter but on those around them.  While he doesn't not sugar coat the bad that comes with corruption he can also spin it to show how a character cannot reach their goals without it.  While modern morality deems that corruption is something that only the wicked would turn to, Martin does a good job of showing the historical significance of having to bribe someone or threaten their life.<br /><br />War is also at the heart of Martin's books.  Again, he pulls on the readers heart strings to decide on who is right and wrong and how sometimes those lines are often blurred.  Does the reader root for the guy that has the right to sit the throne or the person that is rumored to be the rightful heir?  Does the reader opt to support the boy that has lost his father and is after revenge or the ones this boy has wronged in one way or another?  Martin's writing doesn't make the choice very easy in my opinion.<br /><br />With war comes loss, which is the nature of the beast.  Not that all the deaths that occur in this series of books is because of war, but most of them are.  I found that these deaths were almost more poignant due to how close I got to them.  Referring back to his writing style, Martin makes it so the reader gets to know the various characters.  He makes sure to play Switzerland and let the reader decide if they like a character or not.  That plays a role in their deaths.  For me, I was quite sad to see many of the characters die, but on the flip side, I was quite happy to see others meet their makers.<br /><br />All in all, this series of books are superb.  This is coming from someone that does not usually pick up books in the genre.  I was one of those people that watched the first season of \\"Game of Thrones\\" and was amazed.  I took that as a good sign that I needed to read the books and I am so glad that I did.  While they are quite long, I found that the stories are so well written that I forgot how much I had to read to finish a book.  In fact, when I finished the fourth book all I could do was wonder when the next one is coming out.  I highly recommend this book to those that have fallen for the TV series and even those that haven't.  Don't let the idea of dragons and magic scare you away from a terrific story of many lives and deaths, which are all filled with good times, evil times and gallant times.
B00915G6MG|1.0|How is this so popular, as a huge fan of crime shows and navy things I was really excited about this. I am extremely dissapointed in this. It's pure garbage. If you like good telivison stay away from this. It's awful.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best game and most enjoyment I have experienced yet playing a puzzler!  Hints are not blatently shown, only there when you choose to view, then the hint only  nudges you into thinking through to a solution. This is 5 star puzzle entertainment all the way.  Great graphics and excellent background music. Do not miss out on this excellent game!
B0049P1VHS|1.0|It's a predictable and cheesy show. The acting and writing are terrible. I love cable dramas. My favorites are Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, The Wire, Six Feet Under, and Dexter. If you like any of these shows, DO NOT WATCH!!! It is garbage.
B002SAS26E|5.0|Great game!<br /><br />I was a little shocked and skeptical when I read the rule book, due to the simplicity.  I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this little card game.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and BUY IT!!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I've seen plenty of bad ports of Minecraft trying to cash in on the formula.  This isn't one of them.  Yes, it has many of the elements, but does a darn good job of making it feel like  own unique game.  I own both and have extensively played both, but this one offers more variety.
0425263924|5.0|I started reading the &#34;trilogy&#34; three days ago and as you can see finished all three in the three days. I was so excited to finally see how the book was going to end. I started getting confused when I was nearing the end and the story wasn't tying up the loose ends as I had expected. As I turned the last past I think I went white. I am not only upset that I didn't finish what I thought would be the end of the crossfire series but was even more upset when I went to her website to see no glimpse of the 4th book, not even so much as a title and now having to wait for two more books to finish. If she just wants the money ill gladly double up now just to see how the series is to end. I only read series once I know that all the books are released because I'm compulsive when I start reading one. I wish I never started this series because it was hard enough dealing the suspense over the past three days let alone, who knows months or years before the next two are released. Very disappointed.
1575666286|1.0|I was debating about buying this book or another for a whole foods/raw nutrition alternative approach to my cancer. I did a Google search and came across this one, excerpt quoted from the American Cancer Society:<br /><br />http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/dietandnutrition/gerson-therapy<br /><br />\\"Available scientific evidence does not support claims that Gerson therapy is effective in treating cancer, and the principles behind it are not widely accepted by the scientific and medical communities. It is not approved for use in the United States. Gerson therapy can be dangerous.

B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This exceptional version of the critically acclaimed BBC House of Cards series is extremely well written and crafted to our U.S. political scene of 2013.  The earlier 1990-95 BBC series depicted the rise of Francis Urquhart (played by Ian Richardson) from majority whip in the British House of Commons to Number 10 Downing Street and the Prime Minister's chair. The sleazy, literally murderous rise to power of Urquart is matched and even exceeded by the deceptions and savage ruthlessness of Frank Underwood -- Majority Whip in the U.S. House of Representatives.  Played expertly and convincingly by Kevin Spacey, Underwood schemes his way with devious cunning in this first series from the influential, but subordinate Majority Whip position to the threshhold of the Vice-Presidency.  Equally compelling is the portrayal of Underwood's brilliant, power loving wife Claire by Robin Wright.  If you enjoy fine acting and devious, twisting plots that would expand even our own jaded view of Washington polticial shenanigans, this will be outstanding entertainment.  --  Those familiar with the old BBC version will probably anticipate that the rise to power of Frank Underwood is far from over and that the frightening aspects of this weilding of power in the Oval Office by a totally unscrupulous person equipped with all of the high-tech devices of our own time are likely to eclipse anything we might have imagined from the Nixonian past.<br /><br />While Urquart is depicted as a Conservative (Tory) in the BBC version, Underwood is a Democrat.  In both, responsible public policy and poltitical philosopy take a back seat to raw ambition and uninhibited lust for power.
B0050QEYBK|4.0|Stardust is a beautifully written fairy tale with all of the classic fairy tale elements - witches, fairies, unicorns, magic spells,elves, and star-crossed lovers. Neil Gaiman doesn't just write novels, he creates worlds filled with lovable characters. In Stardust, young, idealistic, romantic Tristan gets the most beautiful girl in town to promise to marry him if he brings her a fallen star. To win her hand, he enters the forbidden land of fairies and finds several others are on the same quest, and they will do anything necessary to find the star first. Tristan, a farm boy, is not even a little bit prepared for battles with warriors and demons and magic. Luckily, Tristan's earnestness and trustworthiness is rewarded with help from a couple of the magical creatures he meets on his journey. The course of true love does not run smooth, but it is entertaining!
B0029ZA49Q|4.0|The quality is great. Unfortunately, I am 5'2&#34;, and slender. I was unable to adjust the harness to hold my top loader close enough to my chest.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|Became immersed in hobbit land years ago through the books that one of my sons loved. My now retired horse farm was named after one of the lands. Have all of the hobbit series movies - will give to my almost 5 year old grandson. I had not read any of the reviews prior to renting the movie - but - OMG - I laughed & cried & hid my eyes. At the end of the film, I said this can't be the end - so then I did a little research and found out there will be more to come.  Hooray - this is one great adventure film - so glad to see that a fantasy world such as the hobbits et al inhabit lives on. Anyone who has read the books or seen the original series is sure to love this - we are so fortunate to have the youth of Bilbo Baggins before us and share in his adventures. I can only hope that this will inspire youth to search out the hobbit books & movies to enjoy.
0988178532|5.0|The resurgence of teen literature has been a real gift for our youth. This book is thought provoking, debate inspiring, and a great teaching tool. This series is fantastic for boys, which is often a tough demographic to find interesting reads. I think middle school English teachers should consider this first book as a real contender for the classroom.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I used go love this game, but then when it updated I was playing it like normal antenna it got all messed up. Now all of the buttons disappeared but I can still use then but you can't see then . I'm annoyed because it was 6.99 and I still want to play it. But it is a great game, just Be thankful that you have the buttons showing.

B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|As a true LOTR fan since childhood, and having read the books umpteen times, the Hobbit did a great job in translating the written story into a visual fantasy and feast.  The effects are great, the story line pretty true to the book, and though the critics were less than enthusiastic with their reviews- was very pleased.  Watching in high def is definitely the way to go also.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|Graphics are decent, it's fun to play for short periods of time but gets repetitive after awhile. You're just flying around trying to shoot down the other copter before you're shot down.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|As far as I know, Willis pointed out that he doens't want the same movie or the same features in each flick. So, that allows him to develop John McClaine, We see how he is older. And we see his involvement with family over time. - Then we have the action, a lot of it too fantastical, but it IS entertainment. And the music cues were touching Michael Kamen's original tracks to the first DIE HARD, which had more adhesion overall to the Die Hard series.

B00CCEHYO2|5.0|I picked this disc up the other day on the recommendation of a couple of friends who know my musical tastes quite well. Being a fan of a lot of different music, one of which is strong prog/metal instrumental work, they thought that Scale the Summit would be right in my wheelhouse, as I'm a big fan of Satriani, Vai, Liquid Tension Experiment, and others. They couldn't have been more on target. This album is insanely good, to the point that I will in the very near future be looking for their earlier work. This album has a very natural and organic flow to its music, and its quite evident from the first note that all four of these guys are true masters at their respective instruments. Even the album artwork is impressive, which if I don't remind myself that I'm listening to Scale the Summit and I look quickly I'll think I'm looking at something from Yes' heyday.<br /> If you're into high level instrumental work, you HAVE to give these guys a go
B005LAII62|3.0|Bought this for my Grand Sons ages 9, 11 and 13 and they really didn't think it was very good.
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|I was completely on board from the second I heard that Ozzy, Toni, and Geezer were getting together in the studio to make their 1st new record in over 3 decades. While I, like a lot of others, was a bit let down that it wasn't a complete reunion with Bill Ward not participating, I could live with it. This is THE band, along with Deep Purple ( in my opinion anyway) more than any other, who we have to thank for the very existance of the hard rock/heavy metal genre that we know today.<br /> I was expecting a ton of ring rust from these guys. Even though all of them had been making music since Ozzy left all those years ago and there had been a get together or two over the years, this was the 1st time in forever they would try to create something new again. 13, at least to my ears, sounds like the boys had never taken a day away from each other. This sounds like a very natural progression of their sound in 2013. There are call backs aplenty to their formative years, the biggest to me being Zeitgeist. If you were to have this play directly before OR after Planet Caravan, you'd swear they'd always belonged together.<br /> I'm not going to break down every song, as that's going to be done dozens of times. What I will say is that ALL of the songs fit and fit well, even the bonus material. In fact, Methandemic could just as easily have been put on the album proper. I have to admit I was skeptical and even worried when I heard Rick Rubin was attached to this, after the hit and misses of him working with Metallica on Death Magnetic. But where that album feels forced at times ( to say nothing of how horribly it was brick-walled) this one sounds completely organic to my ears.<br /> The last thing I'll say is this; if you're looking for some musical epiphany or something groundbreaking, this isn't the album you want to buy. If you're looking for mammoth riffs, a deliberate pacing to the music, or in other words everything that defines Ozzy era Sabbath, 13 won't disappoint.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I will read anything Khaled Hosseini writes.  He has a way of taking you to a country you have never been to and help you see the sights,smell the smells and live the story.  His character development is complete and satisfying.  I am already hoping that he is busy writing my next reading pleasure....

B0035WTJFW|4.0|Most people don't recognize the name Phillip K. Dick and when you read his name, you probably just snickered. He might not have had an easy childhood with a name like that and you may not recognize his name, but he is to Science Fiction what Stephen King is to Horror. The films Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly, Next, & The Adjustment Bureau were all based on stories or books that he wrote. Minority Report is yet another of his stories developed for the big screen and one of the most popular. This ingenious film was Directed by Stephen Spielberg and starred Tom Cruise. I am by no means a fan of Tom Cruise, in fact, I've made it a point over the last few years to avoid seeing anything he is in, but this was one film I couldn't miss. To his credit Cruise was very good and exciting throughout, showing a lot of charisma, it was unexpected, but a welcome change from what we normally see from him. This terrific futuristic tale tells the story of pre-crime, a system in which high functioning autistics can predict murders with a very narrow margin of error. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the lead investigator, whose job it is to stop these crimes before they happen. Things are going well for him, that is until his name comes out of the machine and he becomes a target of his own men. The story was deep, yet somewhat complicated, as I was confused at several points in the movie, but that's how you know it's good Science Fiction. The action and chase sequences were fantastic, as was the direction and special effects. The story does however leave some lose ends and I found the precogs to be more than somewhat creepy. It almost seemed like these disabled people were being abused for their unique abilities and not a single character in the film had any issues with that. Minority Report is a long, complex story, but it's fast paced, visually impactful, and will make you think. It only took thirty years, but you can finally add a Tom Cruise film to the list of movies I enjoyed.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|that's was a awesome movie too watch very exciting and great acting.i would watch it over again.also tell friends about the movie.
B008Y73940|4.0|Good film to watch with plenty of suspense. I usually watch these types of films while running on the treadmill so that I don't get too bored.  this was a definitely engrossing time!

1592332803|5.0|I almost never submit reviews (the others under this name are written by my husband).  I've been meaning to write this review since I purchased this book a couple of years ago.  I do a lot of cooking but I rarely used to bake anything other than cookies.  I was looking for a vegan baking cookbook that uses \\"ordinary\\" ingredients that I could find in any grocery store.  I wasn't necessarily looking for healthy recipes but they had to be vegan and easy.  If that's what you're looking for, then this is the book for you.  The author provides easy to understand recipes and great tips.  I highly recommend the Fig Date Bread and if you want something really rich (and fattening), the No-Bake Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie is delicious.  Next time I make it I'm going to take it to someone else's house so my husband and I don't eat the entire pie ourselves!  I wouldn't hesitate to serve any of these baked goods to non-vegans.  They'll never know the difference!!

B00CU0UE0E|3.0|I purchased the EP, over a month ago, and fell in love with it. I love new wavey dance music, and \\"Safe and Sound\\" is an amazingly great song. The EP, I couldn't stop listening to, all five songs were so good, but the added songs to the full album, are just \\"okay\\". I wish I would have saved my money and just kept the EP.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|This movie shouldn't have been made, and if only someone on the production team had bothered to read the script I'm sure it wouldn't have.  A lot of people are complaining that this is the same plot as Hangover the first, and that's loosely accurate, but it's not the problem.  It's the jokes, there aren't enough actual jokes.<br /><br />Hangover the first was rapid fire, clever, it even had a handful of multilevel Arrested Development style moments.  This movie had none of that, it relied on setting and a lot of semi-musical montage moments.  I don't even know how the same group of actors could make Hangover and Hangover II, must have been a completely new set of writers or something.<br /><br />Couldn't be bothered to finish it after they screwed the pooch on Teddy's chance to tell the wolf pack off.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Should be made into a movie.  Loved that it felt like a how to book for guys but also had great lessons for women too.  It was also funny, i actually laughed out loud

B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I'll make this short and to the point. The Master: Fabulous, Oscar-worthy acting, especially from Joaquin Phoenix. No other redeeming qualities. Tedious, pointless story. Characters not well-developed. Could barely keep my eyes open.  That's it. Thank goodness it only set me back $3.99.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|they seem to get harder to win that makes it more  fun  to play the brids are better also thanks
B00BC24NT4|3.0|There are too many flashbacks and, with Kindle, you can't flip back to sort them out. The ending left me hanging. Not one of le Carre's better works.
B000YPWDSS|5.0|It is possible, I suppose, to not fall under the spell of Amy Winehouse.  Possible, yes, but very difficult.  If you have any doubts about her greatness, buy...or rent...the DVD of her performance at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London in 2007.  While it appears that she may have had quite a bit to drink both before and during the concert...that brown stuff in the plastic glass is almost certainly not Pepsi...her brilliance as a singer-songwriter and a performer shines through.  And that back-up band is just too good.  My grandchildren get a kick out of the fact that an old guy like me is such a devoted fan, but this is music we will be listening too for a long time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I don't understand why all the complaining about the ads. The ads are why it's FREE! Skip the ad, play the game. It's a good game.

0786956291|3.0|It is ok.  Took a bit to figure out how to create a character but once that was done it is easy to play.  It is good for getting new people into the game.  One will need to move up to the real game later though as this is just an introductory game
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Deep tale with many layers that is worthy of stories like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. This enchanted story will take you away to a place that you would truly like to experience.
B000I9U75G|1.0|I typically will remain silent and \\"move on\\" rather than take the time to generate a \\"bad\\" review. This movie just disappoints in ways and at a level that most movies cannot.<br /><br />I can't remember having ever started a movie and walking away in frustration before it is finished; even monumentally bad ones.<br /><br />I was unable to endure more than one hour of \\"Godzilla\\". I lasted that long only because I optimistically, and vainly, hoped that something would improve eventually. At last, I gave up all hope.<br /><br />Briefly: acting, special effects, and plot all failed to deliver anything on which such hope might have been based.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great original story about the direction the earth is heading.  Is it fiction or prediction? More please Mr. Howey!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I find something new and interesting in this book every time I read it. The writing, characters and storyline are all superb.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|Like most of the newer game developers they don't understand the difference between a challenging game and a game that is unplayable. I'm on level 14 of this game and can't get passed it,  it is extremly hard that's not a challenge.  Otherwise the graphics are good and the game play smoothly on my Android phone and tablet.
B006MXJ3V6|5.0|This book helped me to understand what it must be like to be deaf.  I could identify with all the characters.  My husband is deaf and it was so accurate from all sides -a great insight.  I would highly recommend it.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This was a terrible &#34;romantic&#34; story for women - the leading man was violent, angry, and self-destructive. How is this romantic or sexy???
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I've read everything this writer has written.  So much of this one was simply a re-hash of the previous segments.<br />Too much detail, not enough plot..
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns are two of my favorite books, so I was a bit hesitant to read And the Mountains Echoed; I was worried it wouldn't live up to the other two. But I enjoyed this book just as much as the others. Like Hosseini's other books, And the Mountains Echoed transports the reader flawlessly into the lives of the characters. I was immediately taken by the story and couldn't put it down. If you loved Hosseini's other books, I think you'll love this one too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched the first two seasons On-Demand. Of course, I had to know what happens next and I was excited to know I could access the third season through Amazon Instant Video. Very convenient.<br /><br />I haven't watched all the episodes to this season, yet. But, as a new-coming fan to the show I am loving this season so far!
B000FC0V3E|1.0|read paris wife and thought i would read this. not at all what i expected. poorly written. filled with anti black anti catholic and anti jewish rants.
B0080MPUUK|5.0|Hadn't seen this movie for many years but quickly fell in love with it again. Keaton shines. Allen' play remains brilliant.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I usually love Hans Zimmer's soundtracks (Gladiator, Pirates of the Caribbean), but \\"Man of Steel\\" fell several octaves short of John Williams' Gustav Holst-isque fanfares.  We have been surrounded with the \\"Superman: The Movie\\" soundtrack. It gets played many times a day and we don't even notice, but we do pause and listen.  This is the missing piece for \\"Man of Steel.\\"  It's the music that drives the movie into your blood and stirs the emotions.  The movie is great...the music let me down. Oh, yeah.  Henry Cavill and Amy Adams were awesome together, great chemistry. And, Russell Crowe delivered a solid performance. I think Kevin Costner must have been left on the cutting room floor, but he had a few intense scenes.  Diane Lane tried too hard to be a farmer's wife, but they did give her a few lines containing down-home wisdoms. The young Clark, Dylan Sprayberry, was very good.  He was able to deliver his lines with strong emotions and has beautiful eyes! Finally, don't believe the professional critics.  They never like anything that's powerful and imaginative.
B001XV09UG|5.0|I wasn't overly impressed with this movie the first time I saw it. But that's true for many of Kubrick's films fro me.  I somehow see a lot more on the second and third viewings.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|As a Peter Mayle fan, I have to admit the Hollywood writer vastly improved the plot --- Max Skinner become a dashing (if overbearing) investment banker, the romance with Fanny is brought to the forefront, Uncle Henry becomes a vivid character played superbly by Albert Finney, Archie Punjabi debuts as Max's impertinent assistant, and the conniving vineyard worker is more of a villain than ever.  And the views of Provence!  Short take on the movie --- it's far more than a travelogue, it's a delightful story in its own right.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Four stars only because the sheath is not up to par. Comes from the factory sharp and ready to work. Excellent for processing wood in a camping experience. A bit heavy for dressing game, but good for removing unwanted body parts if chopped against a good wood surface. Can be used with flint for fire starting or with a ferro rod for enhanced fire starting in challenging environments. Strop this tool to keep it sharp. Don't use a coarse stone at all. A simple diamond rod can do field sharpening, if needed. No similar tool at this price can do as much. I am concerned because of numerous reports here of incorrect grinding at the factory. Mine came perfect. Who is to know who puts out these reviews.
B00271HAK8|5.0|I could be the walrus, I'd still need to bum rides off people. One of the best movies of all time.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun to play but I would not call it addictive, maybe that's a good thing.  My kids play it some times but they have other games like Mindcraft and Angry Birds that they play much more.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|I stayed away from this film for 29 years because of Roger Ebert's scathing review and the fact that I thought the story was about some big city fop moving to a small town and dancing on the tables of the local high school, etc. I was wrong (and so was Ebert). The main character, Ren (Kevin Bacon), is no dandy -- in fact, he can kick some arse if necessary -- and he's not dancing through the halls of the high school every other scene.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Dancing and loud music have been banned in the remote Utah town of Bomont because of an accident that killed the son of the town's main pastor (John Lithgow). His daughter, Ariel (Lori Singer), rebels against her father's legalistic measures through fornication and daring -- near suicidal -- acts. Ren and Ariel take a liking to each other while the former endeavors to free the town of its stifling legalism.<br /><br />Also on hand are Chris Penn as Ren's country boy pal, Willard, and Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend, Rusty. Penn's character is real fun and Sarah was a real cutie back in '84.<br /><br />Although I didn't see &#34;Footloose&#34; for almost 30 years, the film has acquired a respectable following. Maybe this is what inspired me to finally give-in and view it. I now understand why it's been so popular. &#34;Footloose&#34; has that cinematic magic that pulls you in and gives you a good time. This is just a really entertaining movie.<br /><br />I also like the depth. We understand Rev. Shaw's grief, but his legalism isn't doing his people or town any good. I also like how Shaw isn't made out to be the clich&eacute;d villain. This is a good man thinking he's doing the right thing for his town, and in many ways he is, but the legalistic spirit he cops is sapping the life out of him, his family, his congregants and his town. Does he have the wisdom to see his error and re-route?<br /><br />The film runs 107 minutes and was shot in areas 30 minutes south of Salt Lake City, on the eastern side of Utah Lake.<br /><br />GRADE: A-
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This is a fun twist on the zombie movie with a light romantic side. If you want rom com AND sci fi this is the movie for you!
B008JFUPFI|3.0|The curious thing about movie action is that too much of it can be boring. Such is the case with the second half of &#34;Man of Steel.&#34; The first half is a decent origin story for the hero, but the second half devolves into so much mindless action that I found myself bored despite all the &#34;exciting&#34; things going on. Say what you want about 2006's &#34;Superman Returns,&#34; but it didn't make this mistake. &#34;Superman Returns&#34; had great character development and was engrossing, and more so as the story progressed. &#34;Man of Steel&#34; is the exact opposite: The more the story progressed the more detached I became.<br /><br />&#34;Man of Steel&#34; has a lot going for it. For one, the cast is superb. Henry Cavill is the best actor to play Superman yet, and Amy Adams (Lois), Michael Shannon (General Zod), Russell Crowe (Supe's dad) and Kevin Costner (Clark's stepdad) are all fine here, not to mention Zod's female assistant, played by Antje Traue, who steals the show!<br /><br />Like the original 1978 &#34;Superman&#34; with Christopher Reeve, the sci-fi in &#34;Man of Steel&#34; is stellar, only more so. Despite this, the first half's origin tale isn't as engrossing or entertaining as the first half of the '78 version. Still, it's not bad. Things go wrong in the second half, however, where one action scene is lumped on another with top-of-the-line F/X. It's similar to the Terminator films where two or more invincible inhumans pummel each other through walls and buildings, and humans shoot billions of ineffective rounds into them, except that the first three Terminator films keep your interest (especially the first two).<br /><br />FINAL WORD: So my feelings are mixed on &#34;Man of Steel.&#34; In many ways it's great filmmaking, but they fumble the ball in the most important department -- an interesting story and characters you care about. They somewhat succeed in the first half, but the second half is an overload of &#34;exciting&#34; action scenes that quickly wear out their welcome and bore the viewer.<br /><br />The film runs 143 minutes but seems longer.<br /><br />GRADE: Cs that quickly wear out their welcome and bore the viewer.<br /><br />The film runs 143 minutes but seems longer.<br /><br />GRADE: C
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I don't now know why I waited so long to see this movie. The Brits are a bit dry so I didn't really get too excited to see it. What a mistake! I may even watch it again. It's one of the best movies I have seen in a while, chiefly because of the exceptional acting of Geoffrey Rush as the speech therapist. Colin Firth was a delight as King George VI, but Rush stole the show. Don't make the same mistake I did. Watch it, you'll like it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fast paced game....very addictive.  Good graphics for an app.  Would recommend to a friend.  Needs an better help menu or better game instructions.
B00BF11STU|5.0|It's a shame politics kept this movie from winning an Oscar. Even though the event was so recent, this held my interest with superb acting and dialogue. Highly recommend.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Hands down the BEST candy witch house EVER.  Beautiful set design.  Excellent make-up.  But the story just sort of meanders along between fight scenes.  Such a waste.  Watch this one when it's free.
B00821OX98|5.0|A very human and dynamic approach to action.  Keeps you looking forward to the next scene. I have watched both seasons back to back. I look forward to the next season.  I anticipate a lot of thrill.

B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Woke-up early and put on PBS TV and watched a replay of Tony Bennett's Duet 2, and now after seeing it, I am just about to place my order for the DVD on Amazon. This was recorded in 2011 for Tony's 85th birthday. He is amazing. His voice has aged like a fine wine, it just get's better and better. His energy and his love of fine music is so evident as he performs with today's Pop singers in this outstanding DVD. The respect and love for him just radiates from each performer he duets with and is than redirected back to them by Tony. Really a joy to see.<br />I am a fanatic jazz fan and catch the scene at many of New York's jazz clubs and really can't take to today's unmemorable music,  but I have gained a new respect for many of the Pop performers featured  in these Duets with Tony. Their performance's of the beautiful standard's selected here, really shows their true talent when they are given lyrics to perform that have true meaning, and their give and take with Tony display's a side of their personality that is a delight to see. Now if some of these performers recognize that there really is a market for the great standards and JAZZ, maybe they can convince today's producers and broadcaster's that their is an audience for this music after all and than start to introduce jazz to today's listeners so they can get to actually develop a taste for it and once exposed to it, get to like and appreciate this great American music before it disappears from the scene all-together. Tony is giving this music a new life and I don't know where and when it will ever get this kind of exposure again after he stops performing. Keep on trucking Tony, you are great music's last chance to reach today's younger music fans.<br />  LONG LIVE TONY BENNETT!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge all the way throughout the film.  Get the popcorn and enjoy, not geared too much for the little ones under 10.

B0091TGWYE|1.0|-I ordered for 1 and was sent with 2 cases and was charged with two cases<br />- pull handle is a very flexible and its seems it might break whenever you pull it<br />- I like the flip type covers much better as this one gives bulk to the phone<br />- I am just not using it
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I love this game so much. But after getting to level 30, it won't load for me anymore and I don't want to start over for a second time but I look on the reviews and I don't see that anyone else has this problem.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Even though Eva is a main character, someone needs to tell her \\"it's not all about her\\". Definitely not a page-turner.  Mostly drama.  It seems there could of been more action and resolution...don't leave it all hanging again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final book in the series has it all, love, war, hate, suspense, hope, action and even though there are some very sad and sickening aspects of humanity depicted,there is also the power of hope in the human spirit and love.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|great read. I will buy more of her books. Hope you enjoy it too. That's it. I refused to write anymore words and I will not rate anymore of these if you can't accept the number of words I chose to write.

0446547646|1.0|Nicholas Sparks is a good writer and I have read all of his books but I will not ever waste my time reading anything written by Nicholas Sparks again. Dear John and The Best of Me are tied for all time worse books I have ever read. What a horrible ending. I won't go into detail - if you read Dear John you can imagine how this one ends. Very disappointing....
B0015DYIH2|5.0|These books suck you in and the final book nicely completes the story.  It is very different than the movie, the screenwriters threw a nice twist in that the book does not have.

And when it got to101mb it stopped and said that the connection had been lost and the download had failed. what should I do?
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is a wonderfully exciting book and I can't wait to start the next one!  I am excited to see what happens next.
193700788X|1.0|Worst book in the series. Worst book I have read in a long time. DEA is gutter trash. ... Actually it might not be good enough to be associated with gutter trash.<br /><br />Charlaine really should have written a better end to her series, instead she gagged all over herself.<br /><br />DEA is a badly written book in its entirety, and it has some major flaws relating to believability and concepts (ie, Cope making a deal with the devil to gain a wish in order to gain a wish? the hell is that?). Also there are some long standing motivations for Sookie that are overrided and dismissed because it was convenient for Harris. (i.e., Sookie suddenly did not care if magic interfered in her love life when for at least the past 4 books she's had so much anxiety in her love with Eric over this).<br /><br />DEA was a complete waste of my time and money, so my best advice is do not bother reading or buying. If you're invested in the series at all, go read fan fiction. If you're just curious to what the deal is with this book, I am sure your very own navel lint is more compelling.<br /><br />I really wish I had purchased mouthwash instead. Could really use some right now.<br /><br />Oh and if Anne Rice is still trolling these reviews, I guess Charlaine learned how to tank her series and disappoint her readers from you, huh? #shot
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I am so happy I just received this DVD (35 days ahead of the official delivery date ! Good job Amazon !)<br /><br />I am French, so I have known this film for few years now and I absolutely love it.<br />I wanted to buy it with English subtitles to make a present to some very close friends that are not french.I can't wait to watch it with them now!<br /><br />This is one of the movie, French cinema can be proud of and I think everyone should see it. It deals with serious subjects without being too serious.<br /><br />I am surprised reading the reviews that a subtitled film can be a reason for not viewing a film ! Come on ! Are you serious ? Do you think most people that just don't speak english are only watching movies in their own languague ? No they watched subtitled films and not only once in their life but almost every time they want to see a movie! And it is not horrible to do so. Most of the time you just forget you are reading the lines.<br /><br />It is just a matter of open-mindness. You should give it a try, and this movie is definitely the good one for a new start.

B008N1V11U|5.0|this is by far the best Batman game in the Amazon app store! this game is worth every penny you spend on it
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Wow I just got it and I already like it which is funny I'm not much of a gamer and I really like this game haha XD

B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This movie cheered me up, made me laugh my head off,some of the funny scenes are still making me smile!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I would love to have the option of two towns, my son plays this game and I would love to have my my own town!!! Please make it possible, thanks
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Pretty cool game but kinda hard. Makes you think a lot. I would tell my friends about this game because it is fun.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Like fellow director and scriptwriter Kevin Smith, Quentin Tarrantino seems to have been heavily influenced by heavy indulgence in old videotapes, and his &#34;Django Unchained&#34; might be considered a multihomage to old Westerns, horror films, and blaxploitation films. In that spirit, this is a lot of fun, and occasionally funny, but partly because of that referential indulgence, I can't see how Tarantino picked up an Oscar for the screenplay. The plotline is determined but not all that imaginative, much of the dialogue is attitudinal or ludicrous (depending on the characters), and the whole thing is full of gimmicks, some of them admittedly fascinating. Making your way from plot point to incredible plot point, you might pick up a bit of American history (it's set in the mid-19th Century), but parents with an eye to educating their offspring had better put an eye and an ear to consider whether the rather two-dimensional lessons are worth the obscenity and the bloodbath.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love the versatility of the game. Not only matching but turning the cube at the same time. Addicting! Challenging!
B0001K2K84|5.0|Fantastic fidelity, even though the recording is years old. I had this on vinyl, but now it's so much better.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love reading! I just ordered a kindle but it hasn't come yet so I downloaded the app for my phone meanwhile. I think with this app, you don't really need a kindle!
1907947655|5.0|Rated by a significant proportion of erudite people as the best novel ever written, one can only go along with the majority, without any pride nor prejudice, and agree. The story of a man whose pride blinds him to his prejudices and a woman who's prejudices blind her to her pride is so well told and engaging as to be truly difficult to put down. I first read it at school around 70 years ago, and re-read it again last year. I was honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|AMAZING! There are so many different games to close from and each time has a new goal. Also, if you are on a long car ride it will entertain you for hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its my favorite game on my kindle fire I love it I don't know why anyone would not like this game get it u will never delete it its so fun lol
B00847KFDS|4.0|. . .if you've got the original CCR albums or the \\"Chronicle\\" compilations, you don't really need this.  The classic CCR songs are always worth hearing, and I'm happy to report that John Fogerty can still sing -- in fact he can sing a lot better than some of the young guns on this album.  The accompaniments too are tight, and the sound is excellent.  Of the two new songs, I liked \\"Mystic Highway,\\" and I didn't much like \\"Train of Fools.\\"  I remember hearing a song called \\"Ship of Fools\\" on an old Grateful Dead concert album, and this didn't make me want to forget it.  Of the guest artists, as singers Keith Urban, Alan Jackson, Miranda Lambert, and Bob Seger sound good.  Brad Paisley and the Dawes and My Morning Jacket vocalists -- not so good (and I don't think \\"Hot Rod Heart\\" a great song anyway), but sometimes the playing does a bit to redeem the vocal shortcomings.  The others are OK.  Oddly, at times Fogerty sounds like his old self, and at others he affects a vocal style that seems to channel Van Morrison, circa 1973, but either way, he sounds just fine.  So, this is OK but hardly indispensable.
0316056863|5.0|I laughed so hard while I read this - I guess I shouldn't be surprised, she is a comedy writer after all, but wow is she a great storyteller.  From childhood tales to Alec Baldwin's &#34;Irish Negotiating&#34; and beyond.  I'm sure I will read this again.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Fast moving, albeit not an action book. Intellectually twists and turns. Sobering and thoughtful and incredibly crisp in style. Highly recommended.
B001J3U22S|5.0|All Dune fans already know the outcome of this Battle of Corrin. The details leading up to this battle are fleshed out in a very convincing way. More than a human victory, it was a foregone conclusion to a long road of suffering, difficult choices to make and heartbreak, through and through.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I lost the original cable that came with my Kindle - kid borrowed it and it never reappeared.  This one works and looks just like the original.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy this game very much!  It's nice to have the shuffle feature available. There's also plenty of different boards to play.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I love the watch.  Auto minding, quiet, and so far it seems to keep really good time.<br /><br />  My only (very small) complaint is that the band is a bit short.  I am a big guy, and it fits me, in the last notch.  I am replacing the band with a different style, that is why it is a small complaint.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|This little guy can do a lot for todays computing need and can be overclocked (if you are into that) built me a nice PC with this CPU and this things chews thru webpages like nothing had multiple windows open streaming video Hulu and netflix and doing a installation of a program at the same time and this little CPU did not even make a hiccup!! handles well HD video streaming and light gaming, so for the price I am happy
B000KIPT30|5.0|Not sure why Behringer gets a bad rep - this is compact, works as advertised, is affordable and an all around handy thing for the musician.<br /><br />Well built, solid construction - zero complaints.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|I can not remember ever seeing a movie with this same plot. How rare is that to find something original. The story is great and the actors kept the pace. I will watch this movie again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun but run out of energy too fast i like it i have a lot of fun but every thing you do cost 20 energy
0767812166|5.0|This movie may someday be a classic film, though not of the ilk of Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Gone With the Wind, but, never the less, a film with a \\"touch of Humanity\\".<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is an alien being who comes to earth after encountering an invitation from one of our own space probes, Voyager or something.  Here he takes the form of a dead house painter and abducts Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen) for a three day wild ride from Wisconsin to Arizona where the mothership will be waiting for Bridges.<br /><br />The story is frought with angry G men intent on capturing him without success.  Along the way, Jeff learns about humanity and gives Jenny a gift she thought not possible.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film from Director, John Carpenter.  I enjoyed it immensely and I think you will also.  Great acting from great actors and a good script.
B0074PNCRM|4.0|This book is engaging and certainly makes you think, re assessing your opinions and what not. I could not fault this book except to say that sometimes the language can become at tad inaccessible and long winded; i often found myself using the dictionary feature on my kindle to make sense of some phrases. Otherwise this book is flawless, refreshing in every aspect.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|best game I like the characters and I like the swords. and the powers and that you have 100 jewel's
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The movie plot was okay, nothing spectacular. The graphics and sets were beautiful and colorful.  Reminds me a bit of the Speed Racer movie (the colors).
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I had hoped to buy the 3d version of this film, but when there was no 3d/2d combo pack, I just rented it if rom redbox. If they have accommodate pack at Christmas I might still pay $20 for it. I thought the movie was good. The only bad thing was James Franco. He was not right for the part.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This is my favorite of all time! I love to play this game whenever I am at arcades, now that I have it on my Kindle I can play whenever I want!
0061733199|5.0|This book will assist anyone that is going into the outdoors for adventure. Good book for someone that wants to learn how to survive  in a unsuspecting situation.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|For  example, wife and newborn baby in bathtub all bloody with loads of police all walking around.  Why weren't they enroute to the hospital in an ambulance?  Because the director wanted the drama of the husband finding her there thinking she was dead.  Emma Stone laying on top of Ryan Gosling totally still.  Looked like she was waiting for the Direcror to say &#34;Action&#34;.  There's loads of these types of gaffes.
B002OG5GT8|1.0|I bought this item to boost the output of a mp3 player connected to the line-level aux input of an amplifier. Even with the gain turned up all the way, this fully charged E5 Headphone Amplifier didn't produce enough output to drive the amp. I'm returning it and hoping that I get my money back.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|I listened to this highly acclaimed reunion. It is a solid metal album but it is clearly derivative and pays homage to the early Ozzy era Sabbath. Rick Rubin wanted the band to go even further with jam music like that of the first Sabbath album. I would have preferred that since Sabbath had awesome musicians.<br /><br />My recommendation: If you are a hard core Ozzy era Sabbath fan, you won't care what I think. If you are new to Sabbath, buy their first two albums (at a minimum) which are perfect (and the sound engineering is remarkable for that time - that's what happens when you record live in the studio with a competent sound engineer) or perhaps buy their first five albums if you've got the spare change.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Read this series in 2 weeks. I am looking forward to the next book in the series. I checked the internet and it looks like it will be 4 or 5 years before it comes out. I will wait.
B008Y78M60|3.0|hear you have the (Fed gov ).rushing to fine who is guity.of a very bad crime.<br />  np matter whats you say. In thyer mine you did this.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|The story development was right on the mark. I read for enjoyment and this book was great. I have read all of his books so far.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|love it just cant put it down. the only problem that occurred is that it lags every now and then but id git 4.5-5 stars.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|In my option, this book should be read in school. It teaches about unity a d the need to survive and actually evoked emotion. This should be considered an English classic<br /><br />.
B003CBVU30|4.0|Goof ball movie, but very entertaining. It was something that my 15 year old granddaughter and I were able to watch together.
B0050IY61G|5.0|This book is very well written and easy to read. The numerous examples, scenarios, and references make it a very interesting read.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|I had heard of the movie, but didn't know what it was about. Ran across it on Prime when my hubby and I were looking for a movie. It was much better than either of us expected, in fact, excellent. But then - does De Niro make any bad movies?
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|it was a great movie follow the book pretty closely. Would definitely recommend to any one! Keeps you highly entertained.
B000HF6XKO|4.0|Great Performance By George Clooney and Matt Damon. Lots of action and good plot.  I would recommend if you enjoy spy movies.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|this app is fun to play. if you like the kind of app that gives you a head ache... if was fustrating when you get to a huge hill and it wont let you go, instead you die... that got me mad but if that kind of stuff doesn't bother you then go ahead and play this game.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|To those who left terrible reviews, I can only say one thing: \\"I'm very sorry if this film confused you, because if it did you need to really allow yourselves time for lessons in critical thinking.\\" This is not the \\"dumbed\\" down garbage that passes for entertainment today. This is no \\"Happy Gilmore\\". It requires you to think outside the box, it assumes you have an education (or have the brain cell gray matter equivalent), and takes you to a majestically interwoven tapestry of stories in such a way that has never been done before. One of those movies that inspires you to immediately go out and buy the book to see all the details they had to leave out for time. I love movies that are as much philosophical in nature as they are just a visual feast for the senses. I was utterly captivated in the complexity and the so happy to finally see a movie that had my husband and I sitting discussing it for hours afterwards over glasses of wine. We each took away something different from the movie as well as seeing many of the same connections. When entertainment is this good, it deserves more than a mere five stars. I really hope this starts a trend, I would love to see more movies that don't automatically assume the viewers have IQs under 60 and assume everyone has the potential to rise over 160. When we challenge people to think, we start thinking and it's surprising just how many people are capable of it too. Let's hear it for intelligent movies, what a refreshing break from yet another pointless \\"Hangover\\" movie.
B001F12J48|5.0|This is one of my favorite films for Christmas. I have the original version on DVD but watching this film on 3D makes a big difference. I understand what other reviewers are saying about the quality of the 3D version, but to be honest, this is as good as it gets for regular DVD; unless you buy the Blu-Ray version in 3D, but you would also need the television to go with it and a 3D Blu-Ray player.<br /><br />If this is you favorite film, then don't hesitate to purchase the 3D version. It really isn't that bad as other reviewers said. It's still a great movie and fun to watch in 3D.
1490313370|4.0|A huge concern for most people is how to navigate the current economy. Fear of losing your job, money, morale ect..Altucher frames this as a good thing and an opportunity. The book was a quick read. Enjoyable with several laugh out loud moments. The actionable advice given by Altucher is solid.. telling you to build a new foundation for yourself through what he calls the Daily Practice.His advice is nothing woo woo or exotic. Practical and easy to implement. Good Book!
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|This was my first time purchasing an album from Fall Out Boy, and needless to say, this is a great album. It's a very energetic album with catchy hooks. If you've never heard any of their music, check this album out; you won't regret it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It looks just like a regular USB to Micro USB cable, and works pretty much just like they said it would.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This is a great album. Paramore never ceases to amaze me with each of their albums, and this one in particular is very catchy. If you're into punk rock, check them out. They're really good at what they do with their music.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, this is the best album I have heard from them so far.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I became a big Joe Bonamassa fan this past year and really play this a lot. I have it loaded on my computer, kindle and keep the CD handy for my car when I'm driving. I never tire of listening to it and am always amazed at his talent. If you listen to a few of his songs, you will be hooked!
B003ZVJFFM|3.0|I ordered this from another seller from Amazon. I have no problem with their service, but I do have a problem this is particular DVD combo. The item showed fast but when I received the the item, it seemed as though the item had been returned an re-packaged for sale.<br /><br />The DVD version was going well, until the movie froze half way through the film. I guess I got a defective item, but in the midst of it's defectiveness, the blu-ray version it came with played just fine, therefore I won't complain too much.
B003V1WTMM|3.0|Kate is a wonderful writer, there is no doubt about that. However, that being said....she is a bit formulaic. If you have read her other books, this will not be quite as good. I would definitely read it, but would have checked it out rather than bought it. It was not available at our local library; however, I should have spent a few bucks on the interlibrary loan process rather than buying the ebook. There are themes that reoccur in her writing, which is fine...but some old hat tricks for plot. I won't spoil it, but, I was able to figure out most of it before the end. I look forward to her next book but this one fell flat compared to some of her others. She IS a good writer and I love reading her descriptions and enjoy getting to know most of her characters. They are flawed, just like real people, and the twists and turns are there. I guess there were just elements of this particular book that did nothing for me and actually made me disappointed.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Hard to believe what this guy went through.. A good, quick, sort of depressing read. If you looking for a weekend book that will make you feel happy to be you
B0013TTLDE|4.0|If you enjoy Kate Morton's writing, you will like this. I like her style and some of her other books. This one was somewhat suspenseful and I would recommend it.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I got Prompt service, and the record arrived in excellent condition. The album is fantastic , Thank you! I've been jamming this lp for a month now:)
B004QYTRRS|5.0|I got this for my kindle so I can have a movie when on the plane and never tire of it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Indeed, the subject had an extraordinary life and his story was going to be studied for ages. It's hard to add anything meaningful to the praise that has already been heaped upon this book. Suffice to say, if you love bios, Apple products, technology, stories of overcoming struggle, the arts, business or just want a riveting read, read this book.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|This was a good value and an amazing album. I listen to it almost daily and have recommended it to several friends already. Her style is evolving and she is a truly talented musician. The musical genes definitely run in her family, for sure!
B0095P31L6|4.0|Good funny kids movie. A few adult laughs. Not a bad movie to pass some time. Prime membership is great!
0767545109|5.0|I use this to supplement the reading of the actual novel. It has vocabulary and other exercises to engage the student and make the reading experience more meaningful. I would recommend this to good readers as well as struggling learners to reinforce the book. This is a classic and I'm glad to hear the movie is finally coming out.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Easy to read and a great story! Highly recommended. Makes you appreciate what you have and learn about other cultures.
B00881PTRC|5.0|a good way to waste time if you need something quick to play or if you want to play with a friend. Pretty much basic hangman with nice little touches added on.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I read this book in a week's time, which is fast for me. If I could, I would read in one setting! McDougall wrote such an engaging account of his adventure with Caballo Blanco & into the Mexican canyons! In between, he threw in research about running: the history of running shoes, barefoot running, evolutionary account of our desire to run, etc. it's amazing how he put it altogether without losing the audience. I especially enjoyed the finale of the race in which he participated with the top runners, including the Tarahumara runners. That was a masterpiece in story-telling! I highly recommends this book.
B004TI1WME|5.0|It's hard to find a great calculator for a smartphone, you always end up using the one that came stock, but this one is nice. Now if only these apps will include a widget for a basic calculator so I can just turn on my smartphone and scroll to one of the pages and start typing. it would look nice on one of my home screens.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I just started running and I picked up this book after reading &#34;Born to Run&#34;. I liked Scott's personal style of sharing with his childhood & how he started running. The style was easy to read and follow. I also enjoyed his vegan recipe & running tips at the end of each chapter. It made the book even more authentic. With the accounts of his ultra running, I got a sense of his commitment to personal excellence, which was very inspiring. He was always looking to top himself. The only &#34;constructive&#34; suggestion (not negative) was the ending could be better written. It felt a little abrupt. But it did not diminish the value of this book if you are looking for running stories & inspiration to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
B00AYHK7RU|2.0|Disappointing, nothing new from an historic innovator.  His older material (most anything) is much better.  Don't waste you time and money.
0441013597|5.0|I have been a Dune fan since I was 13, and I'm a Dune fan to this very day at age 35. The Dune series is the thinking man's Star Wars. The characters are brilliant and the story lines are epic. Frank Herbert as always been able to write an action packed climax that few writers can envision; he ended his final book Chapter house: Dune on a cliffhanger. Despite Brian Herbert's claim that his father intended to write a seventh novel, Frank Herbert revealed in the book that he intentionally wrote the final installment as a cliffhanger when he found out he was dieing.<br /><br />Dune begins as an epic power struggle amongst three royal houses amongst the stars, and focuses on a young Ducal heir who will grow to be a messianic usurper to the imperial throne. The story line is a well blended mix of political intrigue and action. Despite being a fantasy, the characters are believable and compelling, and not flat and one dimensional. The villains are visually awesome and possess a certain comic bookish / a literary pulp fiction charm. Baron Harkonnen is by far a more ruthless and imposing figure than Darth Vader and is probably sci-fi's greatest villian; the movies have never done him justice as he would have to be done in CGI. Paul Atreides is a more realistic take on the role of a hero as he constantly questions his own actions with both hope and guilt as he dwells on the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />In my opinion the series just got better and better as it progressed; the series leaps ahead at times as as the impact of his empire continues to influence the universe for thousands of years all the way to the final novel. The torch gets passed to his son Leto II at the end of Dune Messiah, whose reign lasts thousands or years; you will have to read the books to see how he achieves a seemingly immortal life expectancy. The books have a very Shakespearean quality to them that is both powerful and dramatic; all of the books end an a slightly tragic note. With that said it is best to avoid the film adaptations as they have all failed to capture the majestic grandeur of these timeless novels. The novels of the series are titled as follows: Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show has something for everyone and I also love how this show does not hinge on you seeing the previous week's show although we never miss it!!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This movie is very entertaining and a nice prequel to the Wizard of Oz. I highly suggest watching this movie
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I enjoyed the unexpected twists in the plot especially as presented by the stories of the different characters and how they evolved and added dramatic traits to their personalities. The best part is the extrodinary marital relationship and the way it assumed dark and obsessive hues. Highly recommended!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|The adult version blows doors on the kiddie version.  A must see movie for those who like action- adventure and horror all wrapped in one burrito.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Wonderful! A must see. Teaches us all at that at the end of the day we are all people. A true tear jerker.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I use the Netflix star rating system which is 3 for &#34;liked it,&#34; 4 for &#34;really liked it&#34; and 5 is &#34;loved it.&#34; I don't use 5 very much but Wool gets one! Excellent story, writing, characters, ……… everything really. I try to steer clear of dystopian novels because there are so many that seem to have too a similar premise.  Wool delivers a fresh take and without being depressing or blatantly pushing a doomsday worldview. Great work!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This movies is fuuny and sweet with a great cas what more can you ask from a movie 5of 5
B001ERMYCA|4.0|This is the album for which, for me, Linkin Park is known. Thanks Amazon for down loading it to me! Kudos
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I never planned to watch THE WALKING DEAD, in fact, I hate Zombie crap! During a particularly boring weekend, my daughter home from University for the summer, thousands of channels on cable, Pay-per-view, Netflix, and Amazon streaming, we could find NOTHING TO WATCH. As an author of Thrillers and Horror novels and screenplays, I have always gone out of my way to watch quality cable series, but TWD was never one of them.<br /><br />That boring Saturday, we decided to give the show a try. For the first six episodes (season one), I found myself weaving in and out of interest and disappointed with portions of the writing and story content. I'm a stickler for strongly believable characters (no one is ALL GOOD or ALL BAD) to propel an unbelievable story line. I found many of the characters to be cliche, as in good guys and bad guys, tough guys and nurturers...all that jazz. I mean, in &#34;real life&#34;, we would all stray a bit from our usual personalities under extraordinary circumstance. At times, the good guys were reminiscent of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE style lectures and pep-talks. This continued well into Season two, though season three did show us some changes to the ALL GOOD or ALL BAD one dimensional character development. By the end of season two, regardless, I am hooked.<br /><br />Unlike DEXTER, MAD MEN, SONS OF ANARCHY, THE WALKING DEAD too me a while to attach to, but having finished season three, I now find myself anxiously awaiting season four.<br /><br />The special effects are killer! If you're like me, let your nit-picky longing for absolute realism amid a fictional backdrop go, and the need for all things answered, and  you'll inevitably grow attached to a peppering of better developed characters (not necessarily the shows STARS) and find yourself interested in seeing what becomes of them.<br /><br />Stick with this series...it gets better.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Well written and the action cannot be beaten by any TV show that I have seen.  Plus Stephen Amell is hot hot hot
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I am a Wizard of Oz fan. I cannot wait fo the sequel. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Up until level 15 , I really had no idea what was going on in the game. I leveled up so quickly I didn't quite understand the game. It is a lot to learn and take in but once you understand what is happening and start upgrading everything it becomes more fun and the time passes by fast.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Couldn't stop playing this game. The graphics are flawless and the story is intriguing. I can't wait to keep playing the room.
1423140605|4.0|great reading for a young person,  my son loved the book and the series.  I would recommend to anyone who has a young reader.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Hands down the best book I have ever read. If you don't take the time to lose yourself in Follett's masterpiece, you are missing  out.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Its the disney classic for boys. My favorite as i was growing up. Baloo is an awesome character and the music is awesome.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I'll put the score of this film this way: on Rotten Tomatoes this film has a 57% rating, with just over 200 critics rating it. IMDB's score of 8.3/10 has over 40,000 reviews from fans giving the film a 1-10. It is the rating that really shows what this film is like, and it is incredibly epic. Best pure superhero film ever to date, makes Avengers look like childs play. I do like the Avengers, and thought it was the number 1 pure hero comic film ever until Thursday night.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My twin grandson really enjoy putting the train together.  He loves them and the puzzle very much.  Would recommend it for anyone with you children or grandchildren.
B00B9366VO|5.0|I love how thorough and detailed this roc is about Sound City.  It was really cool to see all of see musicians share ear love for such an iconic place.  Grohl is all over e place and he really understands he importance of this place.  I'll be buying this on blu ray, it was awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so addictive. Easy to play and so much fun I cant put it down
B008LVCKH6|5.0|Funny, funny, funny. I enjoyed every page of it. I love it how the books relates to events and situations in the world. A real fun book to read.
B008NN8IVY|5.0|My 7 year old so received this Lego garage for his birthday. It was all he had been asking for. While it did take a while to build - that's the idea of Legos, right - he was so excited with the finished product. He loves that he had made an elevator out of Legos that actually worked. It was a great addition to his Lego City.
B0063IH60K|5.0|What can I say?  It's solitaire. Quick, easy game. Great price, (free). I would recommend the game, if ever asked.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Well-presented, eye-opening account of how and where we get our food (and, especially, at what cost). I would recommend it if you'd like to learn more about what we feed ourselves and those we love.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game sucks I hate it iT's just stupid I just hate it there is nothing in the world that In the the world that sucks more than this game
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I now have four seasons and more on the way, also t-shirts and more. I really love all the characters.  Please do not change much.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|OMG I love this game my auntie has this on her phone and it was awesome ! I will never forget my first time playing it on her phone so so so happy and FUN ! Read please homies
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I have been playing this game since it first came out. It is more challenging as you progress. I can't put the game down. This game I find is easier for me to play on my Kindle than on my computer. The graphics are awesome.
1607066017|5.0|This graphic novel collects Saga #1-#6, and begins the story of Alana and Marko. There is an ongoing was between Alana's planet, Landfall, and its moon, Wreath, Marko's homeworld. He is a conscientious objector and she was his prison guard, but now they're on the run from both, with their hours-old baby Hazel in tow, who narrates the action. The two leads are a lot of fun, and the book contains Vaughan's trademark smart dialogue, sharp humor and interesting premise. Fiona Staple's artwork fits the story well, and secondary (and even tertiary) characters are interesting too.<br /><br />I always enjoy Brian Vaughan's work, and this is no exception. I don't know that it quite fills the gaping hole in my comics diet left by Y: The Last Man and Ex Machina, but it has potential and I'm looking forward to more in the series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Holds your attention and  stimulates the imagination very well.  Draws you into care about more than just the central characters.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Excellent visual effects surround a fun story line giving depth and background to the original Oz story  james franco , to me, is a miscast as the wizard. It is not believable that he charms all the witches. But still worth seeing. Great ending
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It's a fun typical racing game that has you going over the same terrain until you can get better to go further.  It's repetitive and sometimes frustrating.  Good game to pass the time and see how far you can go before you just have enough.  it's free, what else you want.
B0081336FO|5.0|Very well produced show that's smart, thrilling and fun. The 1.5 hour episode format really works well to tell the stories with enough depth. Can't wait for Season 3!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|so after playing for weeks...buying pearl packages...getting to level 17....now it will no longer load. waste of time. and just when I was having so much fun!

B00BWBHIUG|3.0|nemo's reef had a 5 star rating with me until I downloaded the update. lots of bugs and keeps interrupting the game play to tell me the same thing over and over. fix it please.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|This is one of the books that I like to re-read even though it isn't composed of outstanding writing. I don't know why, but I enjoy the story-probably at its most  basic elements- though I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend.
B00D6MJOAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the texture in this one.  I don't quite understand how they meld ambient-ish and beat-ish stuff together so well...<br />Super solid listening all the way through.
B00992CF6W|3.0|When I got the new 0.7.1 update they added all of these new things for creative and survival. Here comes the bad part.<br />When you want to play on realms you need to make an account for it. Another thing is that every month you have to pay a bill for the realms that you play in. I payed $7.00 for this game and it should be free because you already payed for the game.<br />It , made me lower this by two stars.<br />If anyone reads this it is trueThis is for everyone
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really accurate. I  haven't got suck in a thunderstorm yet.  Thats important when we're out on the boat. Glad i have  it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Just like any good series the writers begin to run out of storyline and it begins to lose it's &#34;keep you hanging on for the next episode&#34;. We are only in 5 episodes so far but it's beginning to lose it's excitement we had with season 1 and 2.  I'm hoping all the new characters and storyline will bring some life back to Season 3.Don't get me wrong- Walking Dead Season 3 is still awesome, just not as exciting as the last two seasons. It's still my #1 favorite series.
B009WHD3OW|5.0|Very clear no pauses or skips on the movie. Enjoyed watching it with my family. Will continue to use Amazin for Amy movie orders.
1439181780|5.0|I strongly recommend this book to everyone.  Absolutely loved it.  Gives more details, what to, what not to.  It has helped me to see and understand life better.  I am applying it to my life everyday.  Thank you Rhonda Bryne for writing this book.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I really enjoyed the first but this one is better. Tons of ways to improve characters and weapons. Looking forward to future episode.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ok, I waited months for the 3rd and what I thought would be the final book of the crossfire series. Imagine my disappointment when I saw all the horrible reviews with one and two star ratings. I was crushed but figured I had to complete the series. I knew within the first couple of chapters that the readers who gave such horrible reviews were CRAZY!!!  Gideon Cross is hot, hot, hot!! The story line kept me intrigued and Sylvia Day can write the most amazingly steamy love scenes.  If I had to pick a flaw it really would be the ending.  It just ended flat.  With that being said Sylvia is doing something right because I cannot wait for the next book.  Why are so many people complaining that this isn't the last book?  I personally love reading series books because when I finish a really good book I am almost depressed that it's over. With a series I can look forward to the next installment.  I love an author that can write in a way that keeps the reader intrigued through several books.  Not an easy task.  I've read many series where the first book or two are amazing but then the author somehow manages to lose the momentum or gets way off track.  Kudos to Sylvia.  I love knowing that the Crossfire saga of mystery, love, angst and sexiness continues!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I have been reading this book for 7 months. But for an eleven year old that's good because I have trouble reading long books. It was a great book. I would suggest you to read as quickly as you can so you can actually  Will be able to understand the book. It feels good to be done with a 643 page book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome and entertaining. The kids love it so much. It reaches about pet care and responsibility and helps pass the time easily. Tests reflexes.
B00407PNWO|5.0|I have seen this film every time I could so I finally bought my own.<br />Errol Flynn makes me want to giggle with his joie de vivre. His performance in sword fights (even with occasional stunt men) is mesmerizing and his romantic scenes are delightful. I had a little fun with it the last time I watched it I noticed the bangles on his tunic and Will Scarlet's outfit.  I devilishly wondered if they stopped at a boutique on the way to Sherwood. I could go on about the sound track. It is magnificent. The cast is excellent. Just right for each character.<br />Have you guessed yet whether I like this film...................By the way the packaging was pristine and the disk perfect.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I just hated this book!<br />I can't believe the ending! I mean, I spent years waiting and waiting for Eric's and Sookie's happily ever after and she hooks up with Sam? Dog puppy shifter Sam? It's just... Not worth it!<br />Even the plot was dull
B0079IJ0R0|5.0|Bluray - stunning HD version - like sitting front row center at the Met. Watched it to check out the HD quality and couldn't stop watching - even though I've seen this version several times.
B00C2U6G7C|1.0|Shorn of the context of the visuals and acting, this music left me stone cold listening as a mere music CD. Lots of ear-splitting drumbeats, some big, 'dark' dramatic chords... And that's it!! NOT ONE discernible or memorable melody or theme in this music score; just the before-mentioned intrusive drums and lazy, semi-symphonic keyboard sounds. These days, when I hear that Hans Zimmer is going to score a movie, I seriously consider not going to see it! Is he merely overrated or actually a Hack? I'll let the listener decide. But I don't think the producers got their money's worth; unless this actually was the migraine-enducing style they wanted!! Disappointing. His countryman Christopher Franke - who used to score the TV show Babylon 5 - would have been a far better choice. Or even Bear McCreary who is also too fond of thumping drumbeats. Music scores these days are so lackluster. Where are the people to replace Williams, Horner, Morricone or Barry? WHERE?! I'm not saying that today's movies should merely copy scores from the 70's and 80's - but it seems that originality in movie scores is mostly gone...
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Saw this restoration in the theater when if was originally released in 1989. Great movie, great restoration and now it's on bluray - 'nough said.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Better than 99% of American TV by a long shot, but season 3 is just not as strong as seasons 1-2.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book moves along at a nice pace and the twists and turns are unpredictable. That might be the best you can say about a novel.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|It is a little difficult to follow where the story is going at times, but well written. This is a very different story about a country that few westerners know much about. Disturbing, sometimes frightening, and frustrating look at a dysfunctional political regime and the impact it has on the characters and the North Korean people.
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|It isn't cohesive the way that it would be if only a single concert was recorded, but choosing a selection of the best performances of a wider range of songs is the way to go - and with this band, it is all &#34;hit&#34; and no &#34;miss&#34; when it comes to live recordings and performances.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging without the frustration that some other games like this cause. I can't wait till they add new levels.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|It does what I need.  I haven't had it long enough to worry about it.  Good buy. No more words,
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|I decided to first listen to this album just before dusk and stare into the sun for every track except number 17.  What was once considered imagination has now become a global discourse which is rooted in love.  That evening, I fell into a place where two seas met.  This marriage was destined to protect the Earth.
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|No belt clip like the one no longer available.it would cost more to return than what I paid for it.Don't waste your money.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|The things that happened in this book went a little too far.  They were just too unrealistic and there was no suspense.  You knew what was going to happen long before it happened.  The narrator shared too much of his thoughts of what he should or shouldn't or should have done.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed this story and didn't want the story to end. I think Hosseini is a master storyteller and I can't wait for his next book!
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I agree with a lot of the reviews I've read so far.  Very disappointing \\"end\\" to this book.  Trilogy means 3 last time I looked in a dictionary so to drag it out seems like Sylvia was either in desperate need of cash or she just had no idea how to wrap it up.  I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|This book was excellent in how it subtly examined the personalities of the father (Bev) and mother (Neeva) and later the guardian in the tragic decisions that lastingly affected the participants lives from the perspective of their son who observed from the periphery.  From the impulsive father to the insecure mother in their ill-fated decision to rob a bank and the impacts it would have on not only them, but their twin children (Berner and Dell) and then the sociopathic guardian (Arthur Remlinger) who also commits to an impulsive act in the presence of Dell.  These events all shape Dell's view of the world and people.  The setting too is interesting.  The small town of Great Falls, Montana, and the little village in Canada.<br /><br />This is not an action-packed book, but more of a psychological, introspective read.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00BP4X7TG|4.0|Entertaining and well acted. While I enjoyed the film it made me think how difficult life must be for POOR people who are disabled. This guy was mega wealthy and it certainly made a difference. But, I digress. As with any good movie the supporting characters can really make a difference and they did here as well. Definitely worth watching.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like this app a lot but it always kicks me out after a few minutes. I get to pick up right where I left off but it gets really annoying. Fix this please and I give five stars, thank you.
0679805273|5.0|I purchased 3 copies of this book - 1 for each of my children.  I am having their teachers/coaches/important people in their lives sign the book each year and my kids will receive the book at their high school graduation.  The kids don't know about this gift yet, but I think it will be an amazing keepsake.  What a great story and a great reminder that they have so much to look forward to...and so many people to remember who have been on this journey with them.<br /><br />I saw this book at a local supermarket for well over $5 more that I paid for it on amazon.  A great deal for a great book.  A must have for any library!
B002ZG974M|5.0|It is fascinating to watch the interactions of mothers and babies throughout the world. Even though living circumstances and cultures are different, the bonds between a mother and her child are univeral (or should be). What fun to watch!
B002PYW26O|4.0|Love the movie but it was left so open at the end that, when it was new, we waited forever for a sequel. Never had one.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I loved this movie because it expresses the connections we all have as humans. The acting is superb. One has to follow it closely from beginning to end which isn't hard to do because it is action packed and interesting. It shows the good and bad that is part of us all. I highly recommend watching it. You will want to watch it more than once.
B001KZG99A|5.0|A fun movie with humor, adventure, action, top quality acting and writing, excellent photography not hiding in black as so many do showing us nothing but a black screen of &#34;night time&#34; where we see nothing, know nothing but it costs them nothing as there is also no set to film.  Here they actually show a movie, with actors, scripts, special effects, my goodness do they have great and even believable special effects (remember it is a movie so suspend your reality for an 1 1/2 or so and enjoy the movie).  Robert Downey, Jr. is a man that I respect both on and off the screen looking at all that he has overcome to come back from that dark place to establish himself as one of the very best actors in the business now with 2 nice movie series on the roll in this and his great portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.  That alone demonstrates his versatility.  Like I said it is a fun movie so just kick back, let some stress leave you alone and enjoy one fine movie for awhile.<br />Tom
B00AEK9BKQ|3.0|The topic of this movie is sensitive and thought provoking. However, it was not what I expected and left me with mixed feelings. I'm not sure if I liked it or not. Each viewer would have to decide for themself as to how they would rate this move. The acting is great but I have some issues with the topic.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Black Sabbath is back!  Still got it after all these years.  I hope there are a few more planned for the future.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|FLIGHT.<br /><br />I witnessed the crash of Aeromexico 498 (DC-9) in Cerritos CA. (8/31/1986, Sunday Noon) after losing the horizontal stabilizer in a collision with a smaller plane at 5000 ft. altitude.  I saw the stabilizer falling like a leaf, and the small plane spiraling down. Flight 498 went straight into the ground in seconds with no time for heroic maneuvers or a dramatic landing on the nearby 91-freeway. No survivors.<br /><br />I remember hearing about the hard landing of UAL 232  (DC-10) at Sioux City IO. (7/19/1989) after losing all control functions (except engine speed), from which the pilots and many passengers walked away.<br /><br />So turn off your scepticism and get all excited as you watch senior First Officer Denzel Washington pull off a recovery from a situation ala Cerritos (fortunately with 5 miles more altitude) and make a landing ala Sioux City right there in front of God and everybody. Hot damn!!<br /><br />Now be prepared for the improbable part: it turns out that Denzel himself has been flying on alcohol/cocaine overload for a long time, somehow managing to escape detection. All of this must come out at the inquiry, because the FAA are not shmos, and Denzel must pull off another recovery for a happy ending. Stick it out `til the last frame because the son asks the question that the movie viewer may be asking also.<br /><br />Over all, a great movie!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Wouldn't normally take time to write a music review on Amazon. I mean, what's in it for me, right? Can't not do it for this one, though. Those 10,000 hours paid off, Macklemore.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great, intriguing, dirty cop, drama.  With so many twists and turns, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The first episode grabs you, and sucks you in.  Great for the adults after the kids are in bed.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Not quite a comedy as it is billed - - a bit gorey.  Overall not a bad movie for tweens 12 and up.

B00AWJYJVA|5.0|In the first few pages you get into his characteristic rhythm and from then onwards, its just the desire to get to the end of the story. Thank you very much, you can always surprise me!
B0079J28NW|5.0|I have actually reviewed this film elsewhere for Amazon.  It was the original motion picture.  The Beatles' full-length animated feature is so unique that nothing quite like it has been done before or since.  'Yellow Submarine' is on the top ten--make that top five--of my favorite movies list because of the themes, the images, the battle, the journey--in all of its contexts--not to mention the way it interprets and elaborates on the music.<br /><br />I'll always revisit this movie, so I my main concern here is to say what a treat it is to see it in all its Blu-ray glory, which doesn't disappoint.  It is vivid, and, of course, it doesn't hurt to have my first widescreen TV recently obtained being a part of the equation.  Of course getting a home entertainment system wouldn't hurt, and most of you reading this have already finished that step, but it is a good for judgment's sake to be able to state the enhanced visuals without being distracted by &#34;surround sound&#34; and not be able to focus on what a Blu-ray experience will enhance.<br /><br />When the product description states that each frame has been restored or enhanced, believe what they say.  I concur with others that these steps do help you while viewing 'Yellow Submarine' for aficionados who always are looking for improvement in their movie viewing experiences.

B00004W50T|5.0|Some say that MUSIC FROM BIG PINK is the Band's greatest album. I personally think that this is completely true.<br /><br />The album opens with the heartbreaking ballad \\"Tears of Rage,\\" written by  pianist Richard Manuel and Bob Dylan, and sung by Manuel. It's a slow-paced yet moving song, and it is certainly one of the best on the album. Keyboardist/horn-player Garth Hudson and producer John Simon add an interesting instrumental touch, with their soprano sax and baritone horn lines moving majestically around the vocal. Another highlight is Robbie Robertson's guitar, which is played through a \\"black box\\" that Hudson had built. I also like the unique tone of Levon Helm's drums.<br /><br />MUSIC FROM BIG PINK continues with Robbie Robertson's \\"To Kingdom Come,\\" which also happens to be one of the rare instances where Robertson sings lead (though his voice is boosted by Richard Manuel's on most of the song). It is one of the lesser songs on the album, but it's fun. Next up is \\"In A Station,\\" a somewhat obscure Manuel song with a beautiful melody and unique chord changes. It's one of the highlights of the album, in my opinion. Following it is \\"Caledonia Mission,\\" sung by bassist Rick Danko. For the most part, the song is a lyrical country-influenced ballad (with somewhat bizarre lyrics), except in the choruses when it erupts into a more standard-rock format. The change is startling at first, and helps keep things interesting.<br /><br />The last track on Side One of BIG PINK is \\"The Weight,\\" a country influenced ballad best known for its \\"Take a load off Fanny / Take a load for free\\" chorus. However, a closer inspection of the song will unearth some of the greatest lyrics on the album. Robertson wrote it, and drummer Levon Helm sings lead on the first three verses. Rick Danko is the vocalist on the fourth, and both Helm and Manuel sing on the fifth (they also duet on the chorus).<br /><br />Side Two kicks off with another Manuel-composed song, \\"We Can Talk.\\" It's a great, rollicking song with interesting time changes, and it features Helm, Manuel, and sometimes Danko trading off lines. \\"Long Black Veil,\\" which follows, is probably the worst song on the album. It's a cover of a late-1950's country & folk-style song, but the slightly lethargic performance featured here sounds especially poor in quality compared to the energetic numbers that precede and follow it. That said, it really isn't bad at all. (Somehow, the imperfections on this album only seem to make it stronger.)<br /><br />Compared to \\"Long Black Veil,\\" the loud, brash, organ intro to \\"Chest Fever\\" sounds almost jarring. It actually sounds far louder than anything else on the record. Garth Hudson solos on his Lowery organ for nearly half a minute before going into the distinctive main riff. The lyrics aren't particularly meaningful, as Robertson says, but Hudson's playing and Manuel's and Helm's singing more than makes up for it. Live, the organ intro was expanded into a lengthy organ solo known as \\"The Genetic Method.\\"<br /><br />\\"Lonesome Suzie,\\" a ballad composed and sung by Richard Manuel, is probably the most tearful-sounding song on the album. Opening with Manuel's falsetto over a soft background of electric guitar, bass, drums, and almost lullaby-like organ, it's a tale of a lonely, friendless woman, and a narrator who feels heartbroken watching her and makes every effort to get her to smile. \\"This Wheel's On Fire,\\" written by Rick Danko and Bob Dylan, is a more straightforward rock song, albeit with some unusual chords. \\"I Shall Be Released\\" closes the album. Written by Bob Dylan for Manuel to sing, it is a piano-based ballad. It does an adequate job as the album's closer, but it has no real climax. That said, it's still good.<br /><br />The bonus tracks on the remastered version of this album are really very good. My personal favorites are \\"Yazoo Street Scandal,\\" \\"Katie's Been Gone,\\" \\"If I Lose,\\" \\"Key To The Highway,\\" and \\"Ferdinand The Imposter.\\" The demo \\"Orange Juice Blues (Blues For Breakfast),\\" the Dylan song \\"Long Distance Operator,\\" and the alternate version of \\"Lonesome Suzie\\" are very good, too. The only one I might not have included is the alternate take of \\"Tears Of Rage,\\" because it's very similar to the version included on the original album. Still, it's interesting to hear this beautiful song without the saxophones.<br /><br />MUSIC FROM BIG PINK is one of the most important albums in all of rock music. It is also fun to listen to, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in checking out the music of the Band.nge Juice Blues (Blues For Breakfast),\\" the Dylan song \\"Long Distance Operator,\\" and the alternate version of \\"Lonesome Suzie\\" are very good, too.

B00BRBIA6C|5.0|&#34;A&#34; is as warm and welcoming as a hot cup of cocoa with whipped cream and a candy cane on a cold winter's night. Don't expect anything earthshattering or avant-garde here - It would not be true to her anyway.  Agnetha interprets a song like no other.  She herself has said that she is acting out a role of each of her songs and fittingly could win an Oscar for each role she interprets. Think of her as the Meryl Streep of pop music. The opening track &#34;The one Who Loves You Now&#34; perefectly showcases her voice and style and eases you into the rest of the album.  &#34;A &#34; is a more laid-back album of rich textures and melodies and that amazing soothing voice that catapulted massive ABBA hits, with her prominent lead vocals, like &#34;The Winner Takes It All,&#34;  S.O.S.,&#34; and &#34;Take A Chance On Me,&#34;  to the tops of the charts and our memories. &#34;When You Really Loved Someone&#34; was the perfect lead single.  The video is stunning, she looks beautiful and her body language and posture help her to interpret the song and make her story here complete.  It has the right blend of todays sound without compromising her grace and style.  &#34;Perfume In The Breeze' should be a single this fall as it reminisces about a summer love in a chilly beach setting, in the autumn.  So many potential singles, like the mid-tempo duet with Gary Barlow - &#34;I Should Have followed You Home.&#34; This is sure ot be a hot single in Europe at least... and perfectly blends their voices.  &#34;Dance Your Pain Away&#34; is an unapologetic NEW disco song, that outdoes anything from disco's peak Studio 54 period.  It also could could be the closest to an ABBA track.  If anyone can get away with a new Disco song it is the &#34;Dancing Queen&#34; Agnetha. The repetitive &#34;D,d,d, dance your pain away&#34; works every bit as good as &#34;Take a chance, take a chance take a chikka, chance, chance&#34; did on &#34;Take A Chance On Me,&#34; and makes you wonder how muchan influence in the studio she actually had on some of the biggest ABBA hits!  &#34;I  Was A Flower&#34; allows her to do what she does best - use her voice and storytelling to move us to tears.  She recants her vulnerability in a relationship as a lifeless &#34;flower&#34; that has wilted- away...  &#34;Now you walk right through me, like and empty ghost, now when I need you the most...&#34;  &#34;Back On Your Radio&#34; is pure pop ear candy.  And, as good as any of ABBA's.  &#34;Tune in to my frequency, I've missed you for a long time&#34; - yes, Agnetha, we have!  The self-penned cowritten closer &#34;I Keep Them On The Floor BesideMy Bed,&#34;  is one of her best compositions ever.  A signature melancholic one that reminisces about a lost love and how she keeps her faded photo on the floor beside her bed, with call and response and strings and George Harrison slide guitar... and somehow, I imagine this as a Connie Francis cover... fittingly, as she has had a big influence on Agnetha as she grew up as a teenager, in her native Sweden, lip-synching to Connie Francis with he hair brush in her bedroom mirror.  And we are all so glad she did, because we have this wonderful album here today to enjoy and smile about.  Thank you Agnetha, for the music. One only hopes she has more in her to put out more beautiful music, like this.

I liked this one the best so far, perhaps because I think he is closer to a grander theory that acknowledges just how necessary it is for us to be intimately involved in feeding ourselves in order to be well and whole. That is my experience, at least, as a young woman raised on Hamburger Helper, Captain Crunch and Otter Pops, but who has returned to a more traditional way of eating with incredible and life-changing results.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Ok so when I started this I thought it would be another one of the sappy west side story tales that ended like a fairy tale. But now I can honestly say this was one of the best books that I have ever read. It made my heart race at times and also made me want to cry at others. I'm so sad that I finished it. All I want to do is go back in time and start the book over again, like one of those do over days that Brittany talked about. I love this book so much and hope that anyone who is reading this loves it just as much. Simone Elkeles did an amazing job. This book deserves five stars, and anyone who gave it any less has a problem. This book was remarkable and heart warming. I will love it and remember it always as a favourite.
B003EY7JH6|4.0|It took a while for me to get into it, but when I did it was really good and worth the read for sure.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|Enjoyable as all the ones before it, just lacked a bit of action compared to the others. Still, was very pleased with it. At 75, I'm still a kid at heart.
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|It's a very good album with some great songs. But, after waiting 10 years for Bowie to reemerge, this is music to my ears...literally - lol.<br />I'm happy he felt well enough to make this album.<br />If you like his music, then you'll like this album.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It will make you think about how we all deal with life.
B0093X80VQ|4.0|Charlie, his parents, his grandparents, and Mr. Wonka are traveling through space in a glass elevator. They come across a space hotel when astronauts and the U.S. president mistake them for aliens. But the real aliens are the Vermicious Knids, who are after Charlie and his party as well as the astronauts. After taking care of the space creatures, there's another problem at the chocolate factory when Charlie's grandparents grow too young or too old with Wonka-Vites and Vita-Wonks. One of the grandmothers even vanishes to Minusland when she becomes -2 years old. I've read several Dahl books and the man was a creative genius, but this book is more unusual than the others I've read. Unusual is good, though. I was entertained.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|The 14th studio release from Mustaine and co. is yet another typical Megadeth record, well written and unique. This is not the bands heaviest record<br /> but it is one of their best. Give it a listen.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|The Twits are a horrid couple, playing nasty tricks on each other. Not only that, but they are cruel to the children and animals in their neighborhood. When the animals have revenge on their minds, the Twits are really going to get it. THE TWITS is a funny and odd book that doesn't get old, no matter how many times I read it.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|I would recommend battery left free version over this any day. As noted it needs allot of permissions. It has no color options. It is cracked out as far as battery guestimation goes. Notifications are useless as gingerbread + gives this. Amazon gave it to me free and I want a refund! Will look for another option or go back to battery left.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really enjoy this show! It is not predictable at all. Just when I think I can predict what is going to happen,they pull the rug out from under my feet! Keeps me on the edge of my seat! I do not allow my kids to watch it because it is very gruesome but is great for adults.
B000FC21PA|3.0|I had read this book 40 years ago and mainly wanted a refresher, so this was adequate for my purposes. For someone who's never read the book before, I would recommend a different translation. I found the variations in style to be jarring. For example, &#34;Quoth Siddhartha...&#34; in one paragraph, followed by &#34;Are you kidding?&#34; in the next paragraph.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|I think that this game makes you frustrated and it is addicting I wouldn't think of this game as a good game.
0984999302|5.0|This book is great. If you're already familiar w/ &#34;lean startup&#34; methods, this book takes it to the next level.<br /><br />There is just enough detail to get you thinking and understanding how the process is unfolding. And it takes you through every step in the never ending process that is starting a great company.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My son loves this movie. Saw it at this great price and ordered three in case he/we scratch one up with the constant use! : )
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I liked it because I thought it was funny and creative<br /><br />It would be good for kids from age 7-12.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|A really good take on the fairy tale. Lots of action and gore though! It never hurts when Gretel is really hot.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop remote desktop is a very functional app that allows you connect to your home PC or laptop via Apple devices and Android OS devices.<br />Splashtop is great for accessing your devices from other rooms in your home or even outside the home, such as at work.<br />One of the best features of the App is that the developers are very involved and release frequent updates to the App.<br />I recommend this App to anyone with an Android device and a home computer.
B007SGM084|5.0|Wow, what can I say a very good book! Loved it one of the best book I read all year! Wish there was more to read! Grate book!
B003L20IJM|5.0|Great movie! Liked it better than the original movie of Nanny McPhee.  When will the next one be out? Want more
B0083DJWGO|5.0|This book has shifted my perspectives in life. More than most I've read. It gets 5 for that. But man is he annoying to read (at times but not always).
0316226130|5.0|Love love love all the twilight books!!! I don't want them to end! Not sure why the ending is different in the book than in the movie but still love it!
B00D2K40WY|1.0|Could not open at all. Kept crashing. Downloaded several time and the  same thing happened over and over and over.  Frustrating.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders Game is one of the best sci-fi stories ever written. This is my third or fourth time reading the book, and the rest of the \\"Ender Quintet\\" is great as well. Definitely worth the read!  There is a reason why they are making a high budget movie of Enders Game later this year.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was entranced by this story. Maybe it was my love of flowers and discovering their meanings as Victoria's life unraveled.  So beautifully written it is a must read for anyone who stops to admire the wonder and beauty of flowers and life.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My kids adore the show and love this game that much more!!! So cute and clean fun for my babies. No worries about anything inappropriate in this one! Perfect!
B00190KZUU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  So quirky! So fun!  You will fall in love with the main character. It's just plain fun to watch.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|It is always said that a book is better than the movie or show and it holds true here too.  But the show was well done with a high production value and great acting.  Do yourself a favor and read the books and then follow up with the show.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Lee Child out did himself on this book, while it's Jack Reacher at his best it also takes the twist and turns that make Jack hard to ignore. The bad guys/gals seem to be winning, but in the end Jack ,as always, has to finish off an army of bad guys/gals.<br /><br />As a real fan of Lee Child I have to say this is one of his best. For the new reader I recommend you start with Lee's first book on Jack Reacher and follow his progress as he tries to find where he belong in the civilian world.<br /><br />A highly readable and thrilling book.
1423136802|5.0|i really thought that the books would'nt come with a outer box to hold all the box but i am really suprised with this order
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game that will test your brain, but also your power of observation! I definitely recommend it to puzzle lovers everywhere!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|excellent , this girl can sing from high to low (vocal context ) I would recommend this album to anyone :)<br />development of good vocal habits are essential, It is not played on main stream radio, it may be me but i think the people in charge of what we listen to, may be tone deaf. cannot wait for her new album well packaged & fast delivery thanks heaps
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I should not have purchased this book. I do not read much science fiction these days and this one was particularly disappointing. I do not want to hurt author's feelings, he claims to read every review on Amazon.<br /><br />Let's just say that the story is completely concocted and not plausible at all (to me). Some may like it regardless, people have different tastes.<br /><br />The author is definitely NOT another Asimov.
B009LA1QW6|4.0|as i said on the last review (born to die ) this girl can sing :) recommended to listeners of lower (baritone)<br />with the lyrics similar to paloma faith. well packaged, fast delivery well done amazon thanks
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The characters evolve in this season (Raj-Notssomuch) The individuals are funny in their own way, but when mixed, they do stuff that I can relate to that are classically hilarious (and I'm not nerdsmart like they are). I hope there are many more seasons to come. I'm hoping to one day see if Leonard and Penny have, &#34;children that are smart and beautiful&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have played Minecraft on the Xbox and it is not as nearly as good as the game on the kindle fire! I suggest that people of all ages play this game.

B004GHNIRK|1.0|I have not finished this book as yet. It is slow reading for me for some reason. I must have confused this book with another because things aren't happening as I thought they would.

B00BWJARHO|4.0|Technically excellent.  Goblins, Orcs and Trolls have more character than in Lord of the Rings.  Gollum is better than ever in this film.<br /><br />They didn't say up front that this is to be a two part series.  A major character, Smaug the Dragon, doesn't show up in this first part, just a hint of him at the end.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Excelent product, I recommend it to all who wants to but it. You won't regret it. I garantee that to yo
B00D7NRHX0|5.0|I had not even heard of this movie and after seeing the trailer bought it. Obviously you must suspend belief at every turn but it still boils down to the basic love story of two people that can never be together. It was very good, action for the guys and romance for the girls. It's worth the time to watch it.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Excelent product, I recommend it to all who wants to but it. You won't regret it. I garantee that to yo

B000O8OTNC|1.0|I don't know what people on this website consider sharp but this junk actually made my knives dull. Only the first side has any effect. I can get my knives much sharper with a sharpening steel. But alas, you will read so many positivie reviews and buy this junk anyway.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|I knew that some of the students and staff in the International Studies Schools Network had read this book so it was recommended to me.  I loved the way the author captured the point of view of Kimbali and the complexity of the characters.  It was so much more than I expected.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|old school--books--meets new school--computers--in this clever, conversational view of the world of literature as it might be. Not as magical as The Night Circus, but certainly aimed at the same audience.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book hits the mark in helping to explain the difference between our college acceptance rates and college completion rates.  I have been recommending it to colleagues and may read it again myself.  Now we need to think about how to transform this information into action in our schools.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was the best novel I've read this summer! I laughed, I cried...all in one book! To me that;s a successful story.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|Works as specified - holds plenty of wipes for the diaper bag.  My only negative is that the red sliding &#34;dispenser&#34; opening can be a little sticky to open.  It does fit fine in our diaper bags for carrying.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|It makes you think back to that one true love of your youth - that you may have left and/or lost.  What would it be like if you reconnected?  Would life be different?  It addresses questions we all have but do not express.
B002AS463W|5.0|Great movie. Sexy strong well lit great clothes and apartments. Scary happy lucky sad. Must see over and over and over
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is awesome. It has action and comedy. It's the continuations of Thor, Captain American, the incredible Hulk, iron man and iron man 2. The only different its that they change actor for Bruce Banner/hulk, but Mark Ruffalo play great as Bruce.<br /><br />Bye it and watch it.
B007N3GZ9C|4.0|It was a very interesting book, and I will pass it on to my daughter, who is a massage therapist.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I find these whole five series, which I have, five of the best time wasters I've ever had the pleasure to sit and watch.  So clever, so funny without being gross.  I'm on the happy side of 70 and get a great laugh out of it, even though I do use the subtitles sometimes, so I don't miss out on things said 'the American Way'.  I've watched them a couple of times, now, and can't wait for the sixth series, hopefully to be released in September, this year.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|For medevil rpg fans,I was looking for medevil rpg games for 2 days then I downloaded dungeon Hunter 4 and my mind was blown by the 4 clans Archer,Battle worn,Blade master,and War mage.I can't believe it was free!!<br />  :) reviewed by Hunter.N
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|i enjoyed the book...but more because of the insights and thoughts in the book club. I understood the symbolism because of them
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is worth it because it has really good graphics and there is a variety of players to choose from.Also every month this game tours new places.One other thing is the guy who chases you has different outfits every month.Also when you go to different tours there is always a special person from that place for a limited time only.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|It gives you the raw basics of fixed wing RC flight as far as 3 axis control. For helicopters, the experience is not of much value. For free, you can't go wrong. It's better than others I've seen. But as an RC pilot of many years experience, it's a long way from any actual simulation. Take it for what it is: A starting point. And it's fun.
B004LWZW6U|4.0|i didnt even realize that there were 2 of this movie so i rate 4 only because i didnt or could tell by looking at this one that this was part 2. but 3d was awesome and graphics were good. story line ok. i recommend watching first one first
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This is a fun, fanciful movie that's entertaining like a shoot 'em up, action movie is supposed to be. Lots of blood, a dash of humor, a smattering of relationship drama and a twist at the end.  Enjoyed it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game subway surfers is very fun!!! Once you start you can't stop. I've been playing this none stop... I would really recommend this game!!!
1885167776|4.0|The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results by Gary Keller<br /><br />\\"The ONE Thing\\" is a very sound book on how to be more productive.  Mr. Keller of Keller Williams Realty fame provides the public with a very accessible pragmatic book on how make better use of your time and hence more productive.  This useful 240-page is broken out into three main parts:  1.  The Lies: They Mislead and Derail Us, 2. The Truth: The Simple Path to Productivity, and 3. Extraordinary Results: Unlocking the Possibilities Within You.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Engaging, accessible prose on how to be more productive.<br />2. Excellent format.  I enjoyed the \\"Big Ideas\\" summary at the end of many chapters.<br />3. Great quotes that capture the sentiment of a chapter. \\"Success demands singleness of purpose.\\" - Vince Lombardi<br />4. Thought-provoking book.  Simple ideas with big implications.<br />5. This book is about the best approach to being productive. \\"The key is over time.  Success is built sequentially. It's one thing at a time.\\"<br />6. The six lies between you and success:  Everything Matters Equally, Multitasking, A Disciplined Life, Willpower Is Always on Will-Call, A Balanced Life, and Big is Bad.  Really does a wonderful job of explaining each lie and provides many examples on why that is so.  One of the biggest strengths of the book.<br />7. Some ideas and concepts will resonate with you.  \\"Here's what I found out: We overthink, overplan, and overanalyze our careers, our businesses, and our lives; that long hours are neither virtuous nor healthy; and that we usually succeed in spite of most of what we do, not because of it.\\"<br />8. The importance of learning how to focus.  The focusing question. \\" What's the ONE Thing I can do / such that by doing it / everything else will be easier or unnecessary?\\"<br />9. The importance of creating habits.<br />10.  The key to extraordinary results. \\"Your big ONE Thing is your purpose and your small ONE Thing is the priority you take action on to achieve it. The most productive people start with purpose and use it like a compass.\\"<br />11. Living with purpose. \\" A life lived on purpose is the most powerful of all--and the happiest.\\"<br />12. Goal setting. \\"Purpose without priority is powerless.\\"<br />13. Being more productive by time blocking.<br />14. The three commitments: 1. Follow the path of mastery, 2.

0393317552|5.0|Got this book from the library and learned so much new information from it that I had to have a copy for my own library.<br />Highly recommend it.  The Seller sent it in a timely manner and it's condition was as advertised.  I would buy from this seller again.
B009MYARIK|1.0|Boring book,idiotic characters. Did Kinsella pay a ghostwriter to write this book? I read the first chapter and could not even skim through the others. Read the ending and decided my time had been well saved.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|Look at the pictures. See how easy it is to spot Waldo? Only the littlier kids can enjoy this app for 1$...
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Love the gameplay, graphics, and music. I've got a trickster and shaman, and thoroughly enjoy playing both. The female trickster armor is generally nice and sturdy looking, but nearly all have laughable boob windows, following the tradition of fantasy warrior chicks having impervious breasts. I can't say what the other class's armors look like, as you have to pay to create more than two characters. Skyrim excelled at giving women pretty direct translations of the corresponding male armor. Women respond well to that. I'm sure a lot of men appreciate it too. Still, the costume design in this game is a lot better than many others currently on the market. Just a few boob windows away from 5 stars.
3833160454|5.0|Love it. It is very interesting. I got it as a gift for my husband since he makes shoes by hand.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|It was funny we laughed alot<br />But couldn't see the ending.Will watch the end later. But it was pretty good
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love love love the trilogy to the hunger games. I can't wait for the movies to follow, hopefully they do the books justice
068484267X|4.0|The story was somewhat depressing however I have no doubt the most of it could and did happen.  The struggles of the Irish during the depression and the potato famine were so devastating to so many families and are vivid memories and folklore even today.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|REVIEW: It's safe to say that \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" was on my \\"most wanted to see\\" list for films headed to Blu-ray for Spring 2013. However, to get to the heart of this review in the second sentence: this movie totally sucks. There are so many flubs, continuity problems, poor filmmaking, terrible script, and Willis obviously showed up just for the paycheck on this one - which is too bad after the surprisingly good \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" - that it's an unforgivable mess that feels like a Hungarian film unrelated to the John McClane character, \\"featuring\\" Bruce Willis.<br /><br />(continued ...)<br />http://ga-ga.com/discwatcher-watching-films-at-home-spring-2013-a-good-day-to-die-hard/
B001RP1G0U|5.0|Just a great movie to watch, especially when you are going through a break up or divorce. It is both humerous and honest about the hardships of starting over on your own.<br />It is about online dating introduced to a recently divorced 40 year old woman and how she really handles it.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|My wife loved it. She is 20 years of age and is a good movie for the whole family movie night.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Finished too soon while I was still enjoying the union of Gideon and Eva. I hope Sylvia Day will continue with the story as promised. I like the way Sylvia brought all ex-s for these two to be able to deal with their past and be able to move on.<br />Off course the hot steamy sex scenes are what kept me glued to this book. The Crossfire series is the best!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am so disappointed!!! The book was introduced as a trilogy so that is how I read it.  I did wonder why is she introducing more story plots in the book.  I kept reading because I thought soon it will be concluded. Nothing was concluded. The book felt more like a first book rather than the third. In the end I feel that this decision is pure greed and feel duped as a reader.  NOT A GOOD FEELING
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|It's no Doctor Who, but it's some high quality sci fi with great effects. John Barrowman is incredible. Definitely not for the youngster though!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Jack Reacher reminds me of other movies of a similar type that I also really liked, such as Pale Rider, The Outlaw Josie Wales, etc.  While Jack Reacher breaks little, if any, new ground here, I'm a sucker for this kind of movie.  Reacher does a very respectable job of providing some fun entertainment and for that, I really appreciate it.  I don't necessarily look for the next greatest thing in my movie watching; I don't pretend to be some sophisticated movie critic.  I like what I like and I like movies like Jack Reacher.  Yes, it's the old tried and true formula of the anti-hero type loner who comes into town to kick butt as only they can do.  I don't mind that  it's been done many times before.  It's done well here and Tom Cruise pulls it off well.  Very entertaining.  I will watch again.
0061191981|5.0|I always knew there was something behind Chef Ramsay's harsh ways. This book tells it all and tells it like it is. There is an unbridled passion in him about food that is rare. I love that. The content and depth of insight into Chef Ramsay's childhood and rise to fame is astonishing. The only critical thing I have to say about the book is that it definitely needs an astute editor, although it is still reader friendly. Otherwise, a highly recommended read.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|I found myself confused trying to follow the rather messy attempt at a spider-web of a plot, but in the end, it was an enjoyable time for me, in spite of it's many, many flaws.  I enjoy watching Wahlberg and Crowe both and, while it's not their best acting to date, they still turned in performances that were fun to watch.  Broken City is a mess; there is no question about that.  But if you're just looking for a good time, it's still a helluva lot better than a lot of other so-called &#34;thrillers&#34; out there.  Yes, it has serious plot flaws, but for me, they were not fatal.  I will watch it again, which is more than I can say for many other films I have recently watched.
B002RTMXIY|4.0|I hadn't ever seen it because stuff like this gives me the creeps.<br />I finally mustered up the energy to indulge that part of myself and<br />was quite pleased with the directing.<br /><br />A good spooky movie with a realistic spin.<br /><br />Personally I think the people it is about made up the story for some money.
B00BQHA0UQ|3.0|I always love Carlos Vives music, but this one was not one of my favorites.  He did good, but not great.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Kind of short and to the point. Cool special effects like most movies these<br />days with not much story to back it.<br /><br />Eh.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So far, I've spent two sleepless nights watching Seasons one and two.  LOVE THIS SHOW!  LOVE THE CHARACTERS!  LOVE THE ACTORS!
1449410243|3.0|The funniest parts were in the advertisenment.  I am a cat owner and was slightly disppointed i the content.  I did, however, donate the book to the local public library.  I am sure that other people will find it more to their liking.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched the entire season in one day!  Can't wait for the new season!  Can't imagine what happens next.  Thanks for such a great show.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I saw this when it was on HBO,  Great acting, Great story and of course, its History.  I wanted this one in my collection.  Try it, you will love it too.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We rented this as a family and had a great time watching it together, it was fun for our kids and us as well!
B00026ZG10|5.0|My husband and I have watched this probably 3 or 4 times and I don't know how many times I have watched it. It's loaded with adventure and lots of fun.  This is Arnie at his best.  I had this on tape and I don't know what happened to it. I might have loaned it to my daughter. When we couldn't find it I had to hurry and buy the DVD so we could watch it, that's how much we love this show.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I have 3 children- grown now!!! They have LOVED and CRIED over this movie!! It is Such a WONDERFUL Disney experience-- HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't wait for Season 4.  I got so wrapped up in it I watched all 3 seasons in less than 3 weeks.  It really helped my work out at the gym because I would walk and walk and walk on the treadmill until the episode ended! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this may look. like a kid game but it is not. it is super fun cool and awesome. I rate this 5 stars get it NOW .
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book a little harder to get into than the others. It started very slow and once it piqued my attention it ends. Frustrating!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Captivating love story. Sweet tale of unconditional love. I really enjoyed this book by Nicholas Sparks and can't wait to see the movie.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|The old english is sometimes hard to follow but I like the story because it is old fashion romantic and ends happy.
B005QIE5U2|5.0|This is a great album with a good mix of high energy and great melody a must have for any blues enthusiast I usually shy away from live albums but the quality of this one is great
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read BDSM books for years and did not understand what all the hype this series was getting so didn't buy the books until my best friend and fellow book reader made me lol. I am very glad she did, the story was great I have been pleasantly surprised. Christian and Anastasia have a great love story mixed with some great kinky sex. Glad I bought the books and highly recommend them.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I loved all the characters in the book. I loved how the subplot line for each of the girls fit in to create a major plot line for the whole book!!!
B009X2CUYA|5.0|I loved this book and Kate Morton's The Secret Keeper. I like the history and the way everyone is intertwined throughout.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My granddaughters aged 5 and 8 enjoyed the movie as much as my husband and I. This is highly recommended!
0679805273|5.0|Got this as a graduation gift for high schoolers going into college.  It was so appropriate and everyone loved it!  Great shipping and product.  Thank you!
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Please don't let the deliciously frank (and SO NOT SCANDALOUS!!!!) treatment of sexuality turn you away from this unexpected heartwarmer/heartbreaker .  It contains two of 2012's very best performances (too bad OSCAR had a serious case of myopia last year)...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it has you thinking and constantly guessing. codes patterns and passwords. its fun and mysterious. hiddens clues and much more.
B00338QENI|4.0|Skloot did a great job of researching and sharing this story.  I learned a lot about science and cells, but I also learned a lot about Henrietta's family and felt moved by each of them. Thank you to the author for educating us and for helping give honor and recognition to Henrietta Lacks and her family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very nice game. For free should have more keys but it was enjoyable never the less.  Keep up the good work.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The case is strong and durable. I have already spilled something<br />on the case and it came clean with a couple of swipes! I love it<br />Thank you
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun to do on your own or with a friend. Great entertainment for the whole family. Makes you stay up too late!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Purchased this for my grandson's birthday.  He asked for this and I was able to pre-order it for him.  He already had the first season and was very happy to receive this.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|I think there was allot of media hype on this, it was good, but, I expected better,  I expedcted more special effects
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I got this app and it was awesome. Then after about 3 weeks after I got it it wouldn't let me open it. So I might have to delete it. :(
B0000524E5|5.0|I've seen this movie, three times now, I saw it on cable, I had to have the disc, it's good, I'm sure you'll aggree
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|always looked forward to the next read session and loved the authors style and story telling skills<br />I will be looking for more collins books
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This pool is great for younger kids and looks good to. The sprinklers is my favorite part they spray really high. The only down side is that you need as hand pump for this pool and its not really made for kids older  than 6.
B00466HM28|5.0|This keyboard is great allows my music to have a much more natural flow to it!<br />The pads on the other are delayed not sure I got dud pads or just the software I use which is FL studio. Very happy with my purchase, great for people just starting in music.<br /><br />Amazon .... great job as always very pleased with the service!!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Ok so it worked about the first few months but now it won't work and it keeps saying facebook has stopped while I'm trying to do things! It's so annoying! Don't get it! Just go on the web for Facebook! Trust me! It's better!!!!!!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|It is fun but I had to wait 2 months for it to update and when I got the update it wouldn't open any levels so I closed it and reopened it took the update away
B004UID2LC|4.0|Everyone is saying that it is super bad but it's fine! I downloads my music and stuff and my videos from it and it's fine!!! I don't know what problems people are having but mine is fine!
1884883303|4.0|I find the prices to be a good  guide for my purposes. I only wish that a more complete description of the guitars were available.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I use these specifically for radio/scanner listening, where no hi-fi or ambient noise dampening is needed. They're easy to put on, and allow listening to other things or people with an easy dislodging of one side. Non-irritating, and easy to remove to hang up. My first pair eventually lost one ear, so I put some glue at the wire exits hoping to reinforce it some. I'll continue to replace these, as I've found nothing easier for the scanner.
0807014273|5.0|This book I grabbed as I saw experiences in a video and always wanted to see what he wrote in prison.  Its as shallow or deep and you want it to be and it also gives good insight into what may motivate us into doing things or being able to endure things to reach an ultimate goal.  I dont normally like self helpy kind of books as I think most are feel good pie in the sky but this one was more grounded and believable.  Highly recommend although it did slow down a bit during the logo therapy version when he is explaining his technique he invented.
B00BSO2U1Y|1.0|There is much controversy about this recording.  I am not a musicologist.  I can only judge for myself, not the world, whether I like an opera or a performance of an opera.  I enjoy this opera very much, however I did not enjoy the performance at all.  I will probably never listen to it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this games very addicting my only problem is my letters dont load before the time expires and i have to start over so can you please fix this THX FROM A GAMER CHICK  ^_^
B001NA6096|3.0|This movie was OK.  There may have been some deep psychological meaning that I missed.  Enjoyed the setting in Vienna.  It is a unique city. If you don't have anything better to do, it is better than watching negative news stories.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have trouble sleeping. this app is great for that.  Great job on the sound files. the ocean is perfect for relaxing the mind before bed.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Better than I ever thought. Best movie ever. I'm studying to be an actress and Streep is my favorite. Loved it!!!!!
B005G26NJE|5.0|I am &#34;old school&#34; when it comes to blues.  I am thrilled to find a young musician that can express that tradition so eloquently.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I'm not sure why I avoided this book for so long. It is really very good and very emotional. It's a different time period than I usually read and more modern with the trains etc but very interesting. It isn't particularly romantic and dreamy but it is very real. I like the way the author developed the relationship between the H and h. I don't usually enjoy it when the H is so gorgeous and the h is plain but in this book I accepted it. It was hard to read how each betrayed the other but those moments didn't last and the author dealt with them skilfully. The H was just so incredibly honourable and truly deserved to be loved for the gem he was. The h was more difficult to come to terms with but her life had been so difficult and she did what she had to in order to survive. She too deserved the love of a good man.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I'm typically not a JT or this type of music fan but I liked some of the songs and love his performances on SNL so I decided to support him and bought this album.  There are several songs I really enjoy, a couple that are fun to listen to, and just one or two I really didn't like.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I would give Season 2 of Revenge 4 of 5 stars for lack of clarity and sluggishness at times in the story-lines.  I missed the whimsical dialog between Nolan and Emily, the red sharpie take-downs and the clear path of revenge that we had in Season 1.  We did get more background information on Amanda's mother, Aiden and Nolan.  The story-line on Declan robbing houses did not make sense.  The Ryan's story only worked to tie Conrad to the sinking of the 'Amanda'.  The Initiative story that was to end in the finale seems to be carrying over to Season 3 with the statement that Conrad & businessmen are the Initiative.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|This series has some of the most entertaining characters I've ever read. The plot and action are good, but they definitely play second fiddle to the characters, from Alexia herself to her &#34;interesting&#34; friends Ivy, Lord Akeldama, Madame Lefoux, and a host of others. Their antics and snarky comments have given me more than a few belly laughs.<br /><br />The combination of werewolves, vampires, preternaturals, and sort-of-steampunk tech is a wonderful background to a wacky take on Victorian manners.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the book.  I am recommending it to anyone who enjoyed his previous books.  What else can I say?
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect. Zombies sure :-) great read so far I'm about half way through. I'm really enjoying the way the story is told through the eyes of the survivors of world War z. If you like end of the world stories this is for you. Remember Yonkers! :-)
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Keeps me entertained for hours... We all love the ZeptoLabs games... we own all of them, keep up the good work
0375869026|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I like how it shows the different characters point of view.
B00AIJP9BS|3.0|Its got a long way to go. The AI needs improvements. the controls don't react sometimes and are not a smooth as they should be... otherwise its would be a great foosball game... keeping in mind that foosball needs the twist, pull, and push to be played right... so I Don't think this will ever be perfect... just a nice play if the issues are corrected
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a good game.  I can't say it was great because I found some of the scene a bit cheesy
B000026OWF|5.0|I Had 2 get this CD....I still  have  the Album......One of the greatest discs of all time..GET IT<br />Enough Said!!!
B008EL25LE|5.0|This has given me hours of challenging fun.  It is so nice to have a real internet game that is so portable on the Kindle.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Action,romance, and new friends.  Enjoyed the story immensely. Will is my new hero. Julie, Will and Vance make a great team.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I am surprised that all of the 'levels' are pretty much the same.  This game has no depth or challenge.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Hard to believe it all ends here! I will miss Sookie and the gang, but I guess the series had to end. Great finale; bringing all of Sookie's surviving enemies back for one last attack!
B008XG1X18|4.0|If you love posting pictures, than this is the website for you. You can also post videos. You can post ant imaginable image or video.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Everything looked good and just as expected.The dvd and case was in great condition.  However this item was supposed to be a gift, and the note was not included. It wasn't anywhere in the shipping envelope, so I assumed it was inside the DVD case. I was very disappointed when the note was not inside the gift. My dad missed out on the quality pun of 'Bilbo Daddnins' for Father's Day. Overall great product, but please try and include the note next time.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Charming town. Nice relaxing show. You get attached to Ms. Dorkus, she is charming and you want to know what happens to her.
B000QY9WOU|4.0|i liked it. it was definitely worthwatching but the sound quality left a lot to be desired. some portions were poor quality imaging.  but if you love Cher, watch it anyway. she transcends any audio or video problems.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching The Good Wife last season and loved it.  I am so happy that I can go back to the beginning and catch up on what I've missed.  It is my favorite show now and I hope it stays on for a few more seasons, at least. Great show - great acting!!
B008W8X5N6|5.0|I loved this movie as  a kid and i still do. I'VE TRULY ENJOYED EVERY VERSION AND WAS TRULY IMPRESSED WITH PETER JACKSON'S VERSION, BUT THE ORIGINAL WILL ALWAYS HOLD A SPECIAL PACE IN MY HEART.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|I first rented this when I had netflix, just because it was there and seemed interesting. I was expecting nothing much from it.<br /><br />I am pretty picky when it comes to TV and movies... not a snob, by any means - it just takes a lot to hold my attention and I HATE the standard corny, crappy, predictable \\"Hollywood\\" BS.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how incredibly awesome this movie turned out to be!!! And I mean... really, really good!! I NEVER buy movies because I see no reason to watch it again if you've seen it before, unless it just happens to be on TV or something. But, this one I had to have!! I even have the Aeolus (the ship from the movie) as the wallpaper of my tablet and laptop! And I seriously don't ever devote myself to anything entertainment-related that deeply.<br /><br />I REFUSE to be a \\"spoiler\\" so I won't say anything specific, which makes it difficult to express what makes it so cool... Trust me, it is VERY clever, far beyond what you will even think after watching it one time. Every time you watch it you figure it out more and more... it's like a puzzle with so many intricate pieces. I love movies that make you think - and this one really does that! Everyone who I have had watch this since I had it on DVR (and now own on DVD) has loved it!! And was talking about all of the possibilities of it for a long time after watching it. I haven't had one person not love it after watching it.<br /><br />I'm still not 100% certain on what it is that is happening, but I have my theories, and so does my husband - and they both differ. It leaves you wondering. There are so many subtleties throughout the movie that you won't even notice until you watch it again... and again (seriously). I'd love to explain, but I don't want to ruin anything for anyone!!<br /><br />Watch this movie! You'll buy it too!!
B002NNA9N0|1.0|This is just not a good movie.  You will hate it!  I know I certainly did.  Total waste of time.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I never knew the history of Afghanistan. I'm not the type of reader to check out a history book. So to be able to read a story that was both interesting and learn history that captured my interest was quite an accomplishment. This book did just that. Not only to learn about how this history affected the country as a whole, but to understand with compassion the people living through these changes. This is a great book and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B006LSZECO|2.0|For me to enjoy a book, I have to like at least one character. There was absolutely no one likeable in this book and the story was farfetched and not that believable.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|you have your own zoo that you get to take care of and you get to play with the animals by ekh
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|you may have to see this one twice to really get it.  But it's a very good movie with amazing actors playing multiple rolls.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Love looking for the numbers....some are really hard to find. Great graphics and the way the numbers are hidden is so &#34;sneaky&#34;.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|get ready to laugh and cry at the same time!!! didn't win best picture award for nothing!  Really good father son love story.  just alot of fun and heartbreaking at the same time.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Watched it with my wife few days back for the 4th time and still loved it. My wife is not a history buff, but the films artistic interpretation of schindler's true story is extremely easy to grasp. It gives a gruesome but chilling account of the horrors of haulocaust  through the suffering of polish jews at the hands of nazis. Schindler brings on the other hand emerges as a reluctant hero and brings out the best that humanity has to offer even the dark times of nazi occupation and suffering.<br /><br />Must watch for any world war 2 fan.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The start was a bit slow, but the story really kicked into gear after the first few chapters. Left me guessing, and worried, about what would happen next. Felt it could have come to a close a bit sooner, also. Bought the second one in the series and can't wait to get started.
1577314808|4.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me, and since it was available for free online, I got it because the idea of living in the Now sounded cool to me.<br /><br />In general, I liked the book because the idea and practice of being totally present in the moment makes sense to me. It makes life more alive, more focused--more Powerful. And now that I am devoting myself to the Now, I plan to read more books on the subject by Tolle and others to improve my presence practice.<br /><br />What I don't like about this book is Tolle's negativity and nonsense. He hates the human mind, and thinks it is incapable of creativity. That is nuts. Tolle thinks that animals like cats and ducks are Zen masters because they live in the Now--but these dumb creatures cannot create anything but crap. Tolle also thinks people living in the Now will save the world. That's a joke. What will save the world is people realizing that the government is corrupt and evil and needs to be totally limited in its power. The big corporations like Monsanto have bought off the politicians and are destroying our food supply with GMOs, but Tolle never talks about hard political facts. I don't think he lives in the real world.<br /><br />I would say this book is a buy with good stuff about living in the Now. But take most everything else Tolle says with a grain of salt because much of it is loony.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Overall this was a good book; however, there was entirely too much detail. I would recommend this book, although you might want to skim through some of it.
1401929281|5.0|This book is an amazing textbook of information. The author and healer Vianna Stibal shares her journey as well as what she has learned and how to do what she does. Her willingness, contagious excitement and ability to work with \\"the creator of all that is\\" to heal others is profound. I could feel the truth calling me and my desire to learn how she does what she does awaken. She says one can learn it all from this book but like walking on fire..it's easier to experience someone do it and imprint my belief system than reinvent the wheel!
B00005AREQ|3.0|A little disappointed with the album. It demonstrates his skills, but most of the album feels like his is practicing and it is hard to get into the music.  A. Konrad
B000UVT3OI|5.0|who doesnt love this man's music?  gr8 cd with lots of oldies...its a must have for all country music collections
B005OYKI1I|5.0|This movie was action packed from the very beginning.  Anything directed by Justin Lin is great!  I saw this movie on the plane and loved it so much that I bought the Blu-ray too.
B00144VBBS|5.0|my daughters and i always danced to his music in the car.  it was fun...we sang and danced and made gr8 memories with his music
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie after seeing a story on NBC mentioning it. Great movie! It's a definite tear jerker!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was awesome!!!  My son and husband both played it.  Challenging, but not too hard.  I cant wait for the next room.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Barbra was great, plot left a little to be desired. As a professional salesperson, I can understand why his approach was unsuccessful. I could have envisioned Barbra taking over sales
0399246665|5.0|My baby loves to bite on whatever she can find.  And I know these books can survive and last for a long time :)
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|well if u ask me your really going to enjoy this. game its great looking to sooooooooo please get it
B00CQGU9GG|3.0|The idea of creating box set with all the original mixes of ZZ tops first 12 albums is great, and has been a long time coming. However, the folks at Warner Bros have half-assed it once again: Yes they removed echo drums and reverb guitar, but they did not give these discs the sound treatment they deserved as teased on Rancho Texicano, Chrome Smoke and BBQ and the last two remastered and expanded versions of Tres Hombres and Fandango. I gladly would have paid more for this set to have Bob Ludwig fully remaster all of it, rather than put out a brick-walled to hell set, with disc's that were printed so jaggedly that half of them load slow or not at all into my itunes on my computer.<br />Nice try but this set needs to be re-released with a whole hearted effort in quality incorporated.
B009JZSFUY|4.0|For older kids in the family. Great movie to spend an afternoon with the family. Light, not to complicated, plot to follow.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|This film was a good family movie.  It was a little cheesie at times but at the same time, it felt familial with the original wizard of oz.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This book just grabs the reader I was both happy and sad when I finished this book.  It is a must read.
B000MPSX34|5.0|Great movie to watch with your child...Have watched it several times, but usually skip over the very beginning as not appropriate for 5 year old.
0375869026|5.0|The concepts of tolerance in this book are powerful. I am a teacher and, beyond the academic standards, the emphasis on test taking, the frenzy to get into the 'right' school, there is the important question of humanity. What is really important? I believe it is relationships. How do we treat what we perceive as the 'least' of us? Bubble in as many of the right circles on your SAT and make your state proud, but who are you as a human being? \\"Wonder\\" celebrates humanity at its best and is a must read.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A great read as always. Very interesting insight, once again, into the legal scene from the inside. Loved the story line and the ending,,, Thank you, John Grisham
B003L0V758|5.0|Janelle Monáe is truly a gem of an artist and this is such a fun album. I love the energy and weirdness that is found with this album.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I found myself being quite absorbed into the various characters of this series.<br /><br />Emotional Father, to the various staff members. This series enticed me each episode to be<br />anxious to hurry back and see what happens on the next episode.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Wow what a great movie. My favorite Superman so far and right up there with The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Highly recommend it and I'll have it on release day.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|The movie was OK. The book was so much better. The movie was a bit corny if you ask me.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|A must have in your movie collection!  Demi and Patrick are AWESOME!  Whoopi is hilarious!  You will experience a ton of emotions watching this movie!
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Easy install on kindle fire hd. Great compliment to my laptop. I highly recommend the lastpass program. Perfect way to remember those hundreds of passwords, usernames and other notes.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|One of my favorite movies!  Just LOVE Patrick and Jennifer!  Story of fun, innocence and first summer love.  Every time you hear the music that was in this movie will jar the memories of this movie!
1452000247|5.0|Peter is on the brink of discovering life in a different way than he ever imagined possible. On his 10th birthday he is mysteriously transported into a darkened realm that contains mysteries worth discovering. When he first embarks upon the land of clouds, he has no idea of what will lie in store for him, or of the eyes that watch him in the dark.  From the ice castle carved into the mountain is a character called Bonemaker, who licks the air and makes skeletons, with eerie elves to do his bidding. Peter must be careful as he travels along this path, because it is haunted by spirits who can take him at whim where they may, and he just doesn't know where he might end up. Meanwhile, he is on a mission to deliver golden flakes to the fairies and try to rescue the Shylong so that there can be peace again.<br /><br />He will learn the importance of controlling ones mind, as well as discover whether or not he is truly dead or alive.  Will life become more colorful again, or will he have to remain in the land of the non-living?<br /><br />William O'Brien has written this work in a very crafty sense. He is very prolific and descriptive with his words and is captivating. I not only enjoyed the story, but was pleasantly surprised to read the poems at the end that related to the characters, and especially \\"A Place of Knowing.\\" O'Brien is truly a wordsmith, and I look forward to reading what else he has in store.  Meanwhile, I will be passing it along for my daughters to enjoy! I was enchanted by it!
B003TGMFG4|5.0|The author concludes that the story of Alex McCandless isn't entirely unique. Many other mavericks - including the author himself - have set out to find themselves in nature and, to whatever extent possible, extrapolate meaning from nature's innate beauty. Transcendentalists like Thoreau and Emerson glorified the rugged individualism that drives people to seek out life's meaning from solitude and nature - McCandles was just another ascetic who believed that he could find what he was looking for in nature and solitude. Not completely unique; not entirely original. Unfortunately, he died before rejoining civilization.<br /><br />The author states about his own expedition into the wild: \\"I was a raw youth who mistook passion for insight and acted according to an obscure, gap-ridden logic. I thought climbing the Devils Thumb would fix all that was wrong with my life. In the end, of course, it changed almost nothing. But I came to appreciate that mountains make poor receptacles for dreams.\\" And in a sense this quote summarizes the whole book and summarizes Chris McCandless' own failed mission into the wild. I am certain that had McCandless lived to tell his tale, that he would have arrived at a similiar conclusion - the wilderness is a poor receptacle for dreams. The idea that there is much to be gained from living alone in nature is a faulty idea that has been romanticized in books and movies. It is an idea that McCandless chased to its logical end.<br /><br />I don't know how much truth there is to the notion that isolation from society brings about enlightenment. It seems to be a silly concept in general,  particularly since a person who believes that they are enslaved by society and then decides to live in isolation, becomes a slave to the land and to the basic needs of a human - like food and shelter. McCandless' own journal testifies to this fact. Instead of being filled with philosophical insight and new ideas, it is filled with a basic list of what he ate and hunted each day. His whole life was reduced to meeting its basic needs; that is all he could focus on. I believe that in a way, having our basic needs met allows us to be freer to pursue our desires and to fulfill our dreams. There is something liberating about having one's basic needs met. I can pursue my passions because all my basic needs are met. Maslow's own theory proves it true.<br /><br />Lastly, the book is beautifully written and allows the reader to look at what happened from multiple angles. There is no clear cut conclusion leaving the reader to ponder the meaning of all that was read (like I am doing in this review). This book is well worth the read and I enjoyed the book tremendously.

B00C7O8TSM|4.0|This will probably be the last album in the incredible Beach Boys discography, chronicling the most recent lineup of the 5 remaining Beach Boys. The vocals are impressive, with Alan's voice holding up best over the last half century. Even David -- after his brief early tenure, when he did not sing a note -- gets a turn on lead vocals with \\"Getcha Back\\", the Boys' first charted hit after Dennis' untimely death. Although it's still Mike's show (he handles most of the vocal chores), Brian, Bruce and Alan get their chances as well, ably backed by Jeff Foskett's falsettos when needed.<br /><br />It was a nice touch to include the Dennis Wilson and Carl Wilson numbers (Forever and God Only Knows, respectively), and it makes one appreciate their contributions to the band and how much their voices are missed.<br /><br />This double CD includes 41 songs, including David's lead guitar on the \\"Pet Sounds\\" instrumental, but it would have been a nicer touch and an impressive conclusion to the BB canon if they had chosen to release their final concert, the nearly three-hour, 55-song set from Wembley Stadium in London, plus the few numbers they omitted (or did better vocals) to make it an even 3 hours.<br /><br />Personally, I would have loved to hear them do \\"Surf's Up\\", which except for a couple of bootleg versions has never been done live by the Boys. With those musicians in their backing band, it would have been something to hear (or maybe it was not done out of respect to Carl, who handled the original vocal with Brian).<br /><br />In any event, this CD is a much better alternative than the 21-song DVD released earlier this year, which was a glorified greatest hits package and did not give an accurate portrayal of just how well done this production was.<br /><br />It was a lot of work by a lot of people, but in the end, a fitting sendoff for the 5 surviving members of \\"America's Band\\".5 surviving members of &#34;America's Band.&#34;

B002VPE1WK|5.0|excellent quality and very well made. This camera backpack can easily hold two full size DSLR cameras and a few extra lenses, a mini tripod can be subject to the outside. What you want here is for your particular needs, you can become it. The main section of the backpack is configured into 9 separate compartments. However, these compartments (slightly padded BTW) are fastened with Velcro, so you can set inside the backpack into anything it would take to. You can even remove all the compartments if you want and use it as a regular backpack

B007SXB498|4.0|Admittedly, I read the book because I had seen the movie, being that with Emma Thompson.  So, I did find the book rather a slow read, even plodding and methodical at points. However, it is probably an altogether accurate pace for the period.  Simply put, if you place expectations at a leisurely rate, you should enjoy.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The Seventh season of Dexter Is possibly the best season yet. The story arc is very exciting and the ending was truly shocking. Dexter's sister finds out that he's a killer and out of love for him doesn't tell anybody in the Department. What happens at the end of season 7 is so shocking that I don't want to reveal it to you. You have to watch it for yourself.

B008JFUPFI|5.0|I've been at a loss to understand people before, but never more so than after watching this film.  Why RT only gives it a 57% is a question I cannot even begin to answer.<br /><br />Man of Steel is the first Superman movie that's worthy of the character it portrays.  Everything about it, including the story line, the scenes, the action, the character development, and everything else is truly epic in scale.  Forget Gene Hackman in a toupee trying to drive up real estate prices.  This time the enemy is an invader from the stars who wants to wipe out humanity - and he can do it.<br /><br />This time Clark is so overwhelmed by the power within him that he spends years trying to figure out what to do with it. This time we have a noble yet tormented soul, who struggles with the voices calling him in a thousand different directions all at once.<br /><br />In short, this time we have an epic, which is exactly what the life story of an ultra-powerful messianic figure should be.  No corniness, no silliness, no flying around the earth to make time go backwards.  Oh, and no supposedly intelligent people fooled about his identity by a pair of glasses (I always hated that in the comic books).<br /><br />And Superman is no naive boy scout.  He has what musicians call \\"mileage.\\"  That makes him all the more believable, sympathetic, and human.  Simply put, this movie is outstanding on all levels, and I will never understand why anyone would disagree with that analysis.

B001P1MZNI|5.0|This is a great live performance.  I love listening to this album over and over.  The tempo and mix of songs is great.  Fly Me to the Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young are my favorites.  I don't love the monologue, but it is historically interesting banter.  I sometimes listen, sometimes skip the monologue.  But Count Basie & His Orchestra and the swinging mood to the performance bring it home.

I Have gone to grandpa's study to try and figure out what to do, to get the globe downstairs to do something, anything!!?? I'm usually very good at figuring out games without using clues, but this is ridiculous!!! Also, I can't find the third key to open the door downstairs!! I must be more stupid than I thought, or my game must have a glitch?? Or maybe the glitch is just me? I don't know?

B00B0YL0E0|5.0|It is a tribute to the greatness of Pretty Maids' last album, \\"Pandemonium,\\" that I'm still giving their leatst effort 5 stars. The former was one of the best metal albums I've heard in a long time. Not only was it intense, dark, and hard-hitting, but it had an atmospheric chill to it, and it was melodic and well-written.<br /><br />\\"Motherland\\" is quite similar to \\"Pandemonium\\" in that regard, although this most recent effort is simply a good, solid metal album. \\"Motherland\\" is more balanced throughout; there is not a bad song on this record. The highlights, however, are not quite as good as the previious album. For example, \\"Bullet for You\\" is a love song, a typical ballad. The ballad from \\"Pandemonium\\" was a song called \\"Little Drops of Heaven,\\" which was a perfect metal ballad with lyrics more haunting and deep than the simple love song would typically be.<br /><br />It's much of the same for the other tracks. Overall excellent stuff. Song structures and production are amazing, the band has never sounded better. If you liked their previous work or are a fan of hard rock, pop-metal, or metal in general, pick this up. While it may not be the masterpiece that \\"Pandemonium\\" was, it certainly is up there with the best rock albums of 2013, and it shows that even when this band is not at the top of their songwriting game, it's still head and shoulders above most of what's out there today.

I purchased it for my son whose previous laser mouse had frequent issues on  his desk's wood grained surface (it would randomly skip to a corner of the screen - yes we could have used a mouse pad but his desk is small and he didn't like them).<br /><br />This mouse has the bonus of aesthetic color and light patterns you can set via it's driver software.  He doesn't use the extra buttons at this point but I could see them being very useful for many people.  Be sure to get the latest drivers/software from Anker's site as the ones that shipped with our mouse did have a bug that caused some usage problems (totally fixed by the latest drivers).<br /><br />Would recommend this to product to anyone.

B00AHG9KYE|3.0|I was torn between three and four stars for this one.  None of the follow-ups (Clarke insists that they're not sequels, but variations on a theme) is nearly as good as the original &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey,&#34; but those are pretty big space boots to fill.  The part of this book that I liked best is the part that some other reviewers found too dull -- Clarke's description of life in the year 3001.  Even without much of a storyline to drive it, I found it very interesting to wander through his imaginings of what is to come.  The least satisfying part of the book, at least to me, was the plot about the incarnate mind of Bowman-HAL and the monoliths.  Not that it was terrible, but I think the conclusion to the story begun with &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34; requires something grander.  At the end of &#34;2001,&#34; you'll recall, Bowman had been transformed into what appeared to be the next major evolutionary jump in human development, an entity at least as different from current humans as we are from the man-apes at the beginning of the story.  And there was a clear implication that he was going to have some serious effect on Earth and its inhabitants.  But that promise was never fulfilled in the follow-up novels.  That's what I think Clarke needed to do in &#34;3001,&#34; and I don't think he did.  That said, I would still recommend the book to fans of the series and/or of Arthur C. Clarke.

193700788X|1.0|By Book 11, I was completely fed up with the manner in which Ms. Harris was churning out books without any regard for the readers and the characters she had brilliantly (in the earlier books) created.  I boycotted Book 12 but had to read the final installment, Book 13, hoping that this would be the redeeming coup de grace.  Guess I'll never learn.  No actual spoilers included here, many other reviews already reveal them.  I can simply say that reading this book was an unsatisfying waste of my time.  There was token reference to almost everyone who showed up in prior books but almost no real attention to the vamps who were among the most interesting characters in the entire series.  The book felt superficial and contrived.  Also, much space was devoted to discussing Sookie cooking, cleaning, applying makeup, washing her hair, shaving her legs, etc.  Blech.  Fans will inevitably want to read Dead Ever After for \\"closure\\" but I recommend doing as I did - check it out from the library and don't waste your money.

I pray for Marcus' wounds (both physical and mental) to heal, for I know we still need his service today.<br /><br />My son, that wants to become a Seal is also currently reading this book...mostly because he wants to, but also because Marcus doesn't hide what happens when a mission goes horribly wrong.

1612191290|5.0|Most of the cuneiform tablets found in the ancient near east of the second millennium B.C. are remnants of business deals.  And business deals typically involve one party going into debt to the other.  When the business deal was concluded and the debt repaid, the tablets were smashed.  Both parties were thus released from the agreement and were thus free to walk away.  As such, these business deals contained underlying assumptions about the parties involved.  First, there is the assumption that the parties were equal.  They each begin with a clean slate upon which to make their marks and entered into the transaction freely.  The second is that the agreement is impersonal.  Once the deal is completed each party can walk away without any sense of obligation to the other.  Thirdly, it must have been assumed that each participant in the agreement acted solely for his own benefit, caring little or nothing about the other party.  An agreement may have been conceived of, in the abstract, as benefiting both parties, but it also must have been acknowledged that each party would have to look out for his own interests.  The notion that an invisible hand guided economic transactions is a relatively modern idea.<br /><br /> Of course, whenever there is debt there is the danger of non-payment.  A common occurrence was for farmers to borrow against their upcoming harvest.  But if a harvest was bad then the loan could not be repaid and foreclosure would ensue.  As ownership of the land transferred from small farmers to wealthy lenders, farmers became tenant farmers on large estates.  Thus arose landed aristocracies.  What Graeber supposes is that the existence of these debt transactions were so pervasive, so common, and the consequences of failing to repay these debts was so dreadful, that it played a profound role in shaping the psyche and worldview of the people of those early times.  He goes into great detail describing how the language of debt and business covenants seeps intothe language of the world religions.  Debt wasn't just a dark cloud hanging over early civilization, but pervading smog.  If one was foreclosed upon one stood to lose his livelihood.  He might have to sell his children, his wife, or himself into slavery.<br /><br /> All of this gets ramped up with the introduction of coinage.  What is money?  David Graeber approaches this question by telling us the story of money's origin.  Money in the form of coins stamped out by governments first appears in different parts of the world simultaneously, around 600 B.C.  In each case the pattern was the same - coins were produced to pay soldiers.  With the promise of payment huge armies could be raised.  Armies, of course, need to be outfitted and supplied.  This was accomplished by requiring taxes to be paid in the form of the newly minted coins.  Farmers and artisans now needed to acquire the coins, and so had to provide for the military since it was they who had coins to spend.  To this end, markets arose where goods could be exchanged for money.  Thus we see how money, militaries, and markets arose in tandem as inventions of the state.<br /><br /> Money represents the power to make purchases.  Money separated from its social context has no value, whether it is gold or paper.  Even gold has no intrinsic value.  And so if a farmer is not used to the medium, then what is there to force him to accept it?  Answer: the requirement to pay taxes in that medium.  And with an army standing behind the king, resistance to the edict is futile.  Money in this sense is like an I.O.U.  It is debt.  When I offer up this token, you must provide me with goods.  In the marketplace the purchaser is the creditor, and the seller is the debtor.  The general population must bear the burden of this debt - this national debt which is war debt.<br /><br /> Armies are expensive to maintain.  And an early form of competition was that to raise the biggest, baddest army around.  And so there was great incentive to invade one's neighbors to plunder their gold and silver which could be melted down and minted into more coins.  A prime target would be gold and silver mines.  The conquered peoples would be enslaved to work those mines to produce ever more gold to pay the growing army.  Slavery, then, became an integral and substantial part of this militarized money system.<br /><br /> Monetary values become attached to everything under the sun.  Since land foreclosures are used to satisfy monetary debts, monetary values are attached to the land.  Land, therefore, comes under control of moneyed interests.  Slavery becomes commonplace as human beings also have monetary values attached to them.<br /><br /> Besides submitting passively to this sorry state of affairs, the population of farmers and artisans might respond in one of two ways.  First, they might abandon civilization and head for the hinterland where they might fend for themselves away from the clutches of dynastic rulers, huge armies, and predatory merchants.  Or they might stage a rebellion.  And Graeber shares the observation that populist rebellions in ancient times always carried with them two demands - relief from debt and a redistribution of land.<br /><br /> The realities of money and debt pervaded all aspects of ancient society.  Graeber writes about the great religions which arose in this era, all of which struggle with notions of debt.  (\\"Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.\\")  What do we owe God?  What do we owe our king or nation?  What do we owe our parents?  Each of these questions represents an attempt to quantify the unquantifiable.  Be they social questions or spiritual questions, they represent the materialization and quantification of the intangible.  One has to wonder what the influence is upon our modern science where nothing is said to be real that cannot be quantified - that cannot be counted, weighed, or measured.  In all aspects of culture we seem to be witness to the alienation of the human being from the spirit.  Indeed, Graeber characterizes this period as one of increasing materialization.<br /><br /> The economic, political, and social ethos of debt and money has been so pervasive for so long in our society that it is hard to imagine how things might be different.  Graeber spends a great deal of time surveying various \\"human economies\\" that contrast to the patterns of debt-riddled, predatory civilization.  He demonstrates how it was not barter that preceded money economies, but rather various systems of credit that amounted to mutual assistance.  Before money people did not come to the market to trade and barter goods for goods.  No, markets are a thing created by money as we have seen.  Rather, before money and markets business was typically done on credit, but not in an impersonal way, for in the small town or village there was no walking away, though if you proved too much of a deadbeat you might be driven away or ostracized.  In a human economy everyone was beholden to everyone else.  If a hunter had a big catch, he shared it with everyone.  A human economy is a gift economy.  Relationships are personal.  It would be offensive to go around and settle all of one's accounts, because it would be understood that you no longer wished to be beholden to anyone.  But for a community to truly function perpetual cooperation and involvement with one another is a necessity.  Graeber looks to these ancient and so-called primitive societies for clues as to how modern humanity might shape a harmonious, peaceful society on a sounder footing than we currently have, and have had all these centuries.<br /><br /> In today's modern age the business mentality is pervasive and the challenge to come up with alternative attitudes seems insurmountable.  Economic ideology promotes impersonal self-centeredness as if it were the last word on the human condition.  Greed is said to be good and corporate dictatorships the most expedient economic forms, and the current system the best of all possible social and economic systems.  Money is debt and originates in war debt.  The government sides with creditors who argue against any notion of debt restructuring, debt forgiveness, or default.  But the strength of a creditor's claim is nothing without the implied violence of government and law.  If the threats that stand behind the debts were to vanish, perhaps the financial hegemony that rules the world today would crumble under its own weight.  Or perhaps all that is needed is a jubilee as was declared in Biblical times.  If the debt of the world would vanish by means of such a governmental decree, then the true economy may gain by it.  The true purpose of economic activity, after all, is to match production with consumption, but this process is interfered with by the very things that are supposed to facilitate it - markets, finance, and mediums of exchange.  Ancient rulers, perceiving the degenerating state of the kingdom, sometimes would impose a jubilee - a canceling of all or most debts - typically against the wishes of the landed aristocracy.  But it seems that a jubilee would only be of temporary benefit if the same practices and attitudes regarding money and debt continued.<br /><br />At this juncture, we owe a debt of gratitude to David Graeber for framing the issue with such insight and understanding.  Graeber seems to have hit upon an archetype against which all of history, including modern history, is to be measured.  All of our modern social relationships and institutions have been infested with a selfish, impersonal, and predatory mind-set which seems to be fundamental to civilization.  We are left, however, with wanting a solution that calls for more than just debt cancellation.  All business deals are deals with the devil as long as we make them with the same lack of humanity we've done since before the introduction of coinage.  Our very sense of morality has seemingly been framed by predatory lenders.  How can we find our humanity again?

The sound quality is amazingly pure. This is maybe his most &#34;commercial&#34; album to date, but it's still lovely.<br /><br />Anyone new to Andrea Bocelli or opera will likely be enchanted with Quiz&agrave;s, Quiz&agrave;s, Quiz&agrave;s, his duet with Jennifer Lopez that they sang on Dancing with the Stars. She doesn't have a strong voice, but she sings it with emotion, and their voices harmonize beautifully.<br /><br />Sar&agrave; Settembre, his Italian version of September Morn (Neil Diamond) is great, as is the rest of the album.<br /><br />The only track I don't feel as much of the others is his rendition of Love Me Tender (Elvis). Although the album version is smoother than on the live performance I saw on PBS, his English is a little bit stilted. But it's still very nice, and I don't dislike it enough to skip it.<br /><br />Wonderful album. I could just listen to him sing all day.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Before I started this book all I really knew about Tesla was that he was somehow responsible for a magnetic event that took place many years ago in some part of Siberia.<br />Looks like I wasn't concentrating too much when I watched the History Channel that day.<br />Now I know he probably invented radio, he and Edison were in a grudge match that should have been held in Madison Square  Garden, and that his life and fortune were manipulated by men who had too much fortune to be jealous of another person.<br />I should've known more; my college major is math. Maybe that's why I enjoyed reading that Tesla stopped when a burst of genius hit him to design a certain something by drawing it in the dirt. You see, a man named Archimedes used to draw in the dirt, but for two reasons: one- because he just got an important idea; two- he couldn't go to Wal-Mart for paper.<br />Tesla was a genius of the same rank as Edison. Do you know what happens when you put two extremely bright men in the same room? They try to win each other over. Neither one will give up his own idea. Edison believed strongly in direct current. You might have had a string of Christmas lights that all go out when one is burned out. That's direct current. I remember my mom testing the strings of bulbs before they went on the tree because DC was the only way strings of Christmas bulbs came at that time. Inevitably one bulb would go out and all the strings plugged in together would go dark. If it was after Christmas, Mom decided it was time to take the tree down anyway.<br />But she didn't put the lights away until she found out which ONE had ruined everything.<br />Tesla believed in alternating current. All strings of Christmas bulbs in my house are alternating current. Do they even make DC anymore? Tesla presented his proposal to a man named Westinghouse. He had a backer.<br />But Edison wouldn't fold that easily. Some of the things he did, the public spectacles he created, to prove how deadly alternating current was reminds me of two 4 year olds fighting over the last cookie.<br />Westinghouse had promised Tesla a certain payment per month and per patent. People were so frightened of something safe, that payment couldn't be met.<br />Oh sure, Tesla had worked with Edison for a short while, until he figured out why  good old Thomas was treating him that way. Their match was made further south of Heaven.<br />But finally alternating current was accepted and preferred. Direct current wasn't practical.<br />Tesla could turn his mind to other interests...so many interests.<br />Now that I know about him I can rank him slightly under Da Vinci for creativity. Except for Jesus Christ and His family, I don't put anyone higher than Da Vinci.<br />But until you read this book to understand Tesla's suffering and true genius you won't know what I'm talking about.<br />Hopefully the man is discussed in today's schools. He was completely ignored in my day. That's one reason I keep reading. My grandfather told me a well educated person knows a lot about one thing and a little about a lot of things. I'm still working on my lot of things.
0307595862|4.0|Great sense of place and loads of conflicted characters with secrets - plus a creepy killer. Even though I had this figured out halfway in, I went along for the rest of the ride to see how Harry would get his man.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like this. So far I'm winning. That's good I gotta win that just me. Win, Win That it.That's me!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|When the original AC came out, the lack of the plot really relegated the movie to \\"fan service\\" in my book. I liked the movie because I liked FF7, and for no other reasons. The \\"Complete\\" version added about half-hour more content that made the plot a lot stronger by clarifying a lot of the questions raised in the the original version, such as the origin of geostima and the silver-haired-trio. And while Cloud was still emo....his attitude was a bit more understandable than the teenage angsty-ness that was the original movie. Finally, I might be mistaken, but the ending montage after the credits was extended and was a nice touch. Overall, while I won't say the new changes made AC Complete into a masterpiece, it is miles better than the original and deserves at least a second look.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Love the graphics Everything is so beautiful but I really haven't played enough to give this a good review right now.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like the fifty shades of grey series I was just hoping for quick entertaining reads. The first two books fulfilled that need, but this third one was terrible! I wasn't paying attention to my kindle page and didn't realize I was at the end until I read the author's &#34;letter&#34; to the readers. The ups and downs of their relationship have grown tiresome and boring.
1601251505|5.0|This book seems to cost to much in general but it is an essential item for gameplay. Glad to finally have it and be able to look up stuff on the spot and not deal with a pdf lol
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Wish it would update, but really fun. Good way to waste time!!!  Can't add friends at all, and can't update. I love all the ponies though
B0038BBA4I|5.0|An amazing band.  Saw them live last week, had to get the album.  An amazing show that sounded just as good as the studio recorded album!
B009MYARIK|3.0|This book is fine for what it is - a summertime popcorn book.  An easy way to pass the time when on the beach or waiting at the airport.  Don't expect great fiction, but it is fine for what it is.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is a lot of fun. Facebook integration stopped working wish they would fix it. Stopped working after last upgrade
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|I knew not to have high hopes for this, but I really like Jeremy Renner, I like fairy tales, and I like scary witches, so I gave it a go.  It was entertaining in it's own special way, but it made no sense, was choppy, and attempted to riff on Joss Whedon for humor(and failing), and did I mention that it made no sense?  If you can get past that fact, then the stylish look of the flick, the scary witches and Jeremy Renner will make a viewing of this worthwhile.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This novel makes you realize how much one could appreciate the simple things in life.  Family is everything.  Education is primo as well. I will recommend this to my friends and family.
068817776X|5.0|This is a fascinating story of one woman who had the nerve to act and keep on acting under the most trying circumstances in order to keep on living. It's a quick read and it is of interest  both from a women's history perspective and a holocaust perspective.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you're a fan of Game of Thrones, then this is a must read.  After the first two books, it is easier to concentrate on the plot because the multitude of characters and the style of writing are familiar.  As in the first two books, this again has in-depth characters, and is also plot driven.  Just when you think you have a handle on a character, they switch from static to dynamic, meaning they show a different side.  I can always tell a godd book but how often I think about it after I've read it, and there were days I couldn't get this book out of my head!  Can't wait to drop back into the story with the book four.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|The  full length feature was a snoozer. The trailer had all highlights that went over like a rock in the real movie.  Spend your money on a good banana split than this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely riveting!  Can't hardly wait for next episodes.  When will episode 4 be available? Prime show showing life in England.
B0009IW9DE|5.0|This is my second favourite album by John Mellencamp, who had to keep adding the nickname `Cougar' to his own, since his first manager had forced him to start under the name Johnny Cougar in 1976! This LP was one of his most successful worldwide, with 4 singles released from it. I love most of the tracks; my very favourite is `Empty Hands' **** co-written with JM's long-time collaborator George Green (now deceased): it has a subtle pathos to it, it pulls at my heart everytime, it sounds as if it is going to go upbeat and rise, but it remains just under the surface with a desperation that is perfectly understated, if not by the words, by the tune and the folk violin.<br />The overall sound or genre here is folk rock with a variety of traditional instruments such as mandolin, banjo, dobro, dulcimer, fiddle, harmonica, penny whistle, accordion, melodica, autoharp, claves, cowbell, tambourine... and surprisingly a saxophone too. You could say it was the fashion at the time, but here it is perfectly crafted and does not sound over-produced or fake. The previous album in 1985 was a rock album containing many songs about the social problems facing Americans, especially in the countryside, it was full of anger and disappointment. With this one, JM raises some more global issues I feel; in other words people around the world could and did relate to it. I grew up in Continental Europe and English was not my native tongue, however this album really got my heart beating stronger at the time. Moreover, it has aged well, it is still very warm and loving, full of compassionate ideas springing from all the disappointed lives Mellencamp describes in his songs. Yes, the lyrics are uncovering some tough experiences, there is hurt everywhere. But, at the same time, the stories are mostly short portraits juxtaposed, to give a hint of what might be shocking out there. It's a little bit of social impressionism, it's not didactic (except if you feel the \\"Dear Mr. President\\" is directly addressed to you!) Be in no doubt though, it's a album with a conscience and it's not hiding away from it. I find, it is perfectly matched with the very natural feel of the music. It flows very well and helps swallowing the bitter pill, you could say. I don't think any real solution is offered and possibly the blame is laid at the feet of the politicians - or is it the shame?<br />The current recession brings back an album like this into actuality, sadly for the state of our economy, but in musical terms it proves that these songs are still relevant, touching and very well written.<br />Amongst all these songs about social hardship: `Paper in Fire' **** `Down and Out in Paradise' **(*), `Check It Out' ***, `The Real Life' **, `We Are The People' ***, `Hard Times for an Honest Man' *(*) ... there is some comic relief, with some great tracks recounting some anecdotal life events in a tongue-in-cheek mode (probably not true life at all, but seemingly honest, simple, touching and quite amusing) `Rooty Toot Toot' ***, `Cherry Bomb' ****. To be fair, there is also some irony at every possible turn: it is Mellencamp writing the songs! I have pasted this as an example: \\"If you are one of the fortunate ones, We all know it's lonely up there, We understand that nobody's got it made, So our thoughts are with you.\\" Yes, in this album, there is humour and determination as well as sadness and desperation; a much more grown up JM, compared to the album Scarecrow.<br />My least fav track is `Hotdogs and Hamburgers' * (the story about an Indian girl and a white boy meeting) but it's only my own personal preferences here. On this album, the atmosphere remains the same all along, there is no break in the mood, which is great, because a different kind of song thrown in there, would take away from the other tracks. Here, JM did not try to showcase his talent and all the variety of rock music we know he is capable of producing. He sings from one voice and therefore he has perfectly communicated some overwhelming emotion(s). It is a lovely album, I warmly recommend it.<br /><br />For the record, I own all JM's albums and I have uploaded more reviews. I give **** max. to tracks I love, * to songs I feel are still worth listening to.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Who could dislike Tom Selleck, right? He's the nice and amiable type...but I had also never thought of him as a top-tier actor. This role fits him like a snug pair of jeans, though. His acting is very natural in it, and has a lot of manly weight to it. It's a darker, cop/detective role he's portraying. It allows him to offer a relaxed and believable performance as a jaded, functional alcoholic still in love with his ex-wife, but not pining so significantly that he would shun the affections, nay advances, of the charming ladies that throw themselves at him. The character's  unavailability don't seem to deter women from appreciating his manliness and nothing-to-lose disposition. This is the first story in the series and I'm sorry I didn't watch this one first. The one called Stone Cold was made ahead of it. Wish they'd made it easier to view them in the order they were made, or in the order that the stories \\"go\\".
B000001FQ8|4.0|Big Daddy is the introspected album by Mellencamp, in fact he didn't admit (in songs) to so much soul-searching until 2008-2010. This is the only Mellencamp album of the eighties written (nearly) entirely by him, with the exception of the hidden/extra track `Let It All Hang Out' ** a cover of a 1967 single by The Hombres (it's not listed on the original versions I own, but it can be selected on my old CD as track 12); it's a good version and was released as a single.<br />I think this album is beautiful and if you don't love it straight away, it will grow on you later. The vocals are not at the forefront of the production and there are quite a few instrumental gaps in some of the songs and atmospheric intros. It all builds into a reflective and quiet mood, for most of the tracks but not all: there are several energetic moments. The album is quite rich and full of surprises; in other words it's got depth, the listener has to be willing to peel the layers and take his/her time. I don't know if it is telling or not, but the lyrics were not printed on the cassette (nor CD) inlay. Instead, we get photographs of the band sort of huddled together and of John Mellencamp playing with and hugging his daughters Teddi Jo and Justice. Lovely picture disc also.<br />The album is not as folksy as the previous one: apart from the mandolin, violin, oboe and accordion, it is very much a guitar album, with great rhythm section. The album starts with `Big Daddy of Them All' ** at first it sounds like we're still in 1987, but the song spirals inwards into a very quiet number, the instruments echo but the vocals don't rise up because it is a song about growing old or disappointed; \\"You used to raise your voice so that it could be heard\\", not anymore: here Mellencamp mutters as if tired. On `Void in My Heart' *(*) the vocals are a bit clearer and the tempo gets up, it's biographical: mentioning his, then, 3 children, his job for the telephone company, his wealth, but also his soul and final rest. `Mansions In Heaven' * has a dreamy quality to it and offers another take on the theme of aging and dying. At the end of the album, before the extra song, there is a bluesy number called `J.M.'s Question' * a list of grievances compiled by Mr J.M. It's got nicotine, ozone, Farm Aid, a mean babysitter, preacher, lawyers, satanic message and more, including irony (or is it cynicism?) I like the \\"There's too much sodium in my heartburn medicine.\\" JM conveys a feeling of tiredness very well and the question was rhetorical anyway, just as well `cos I must admit, I had to look up the lyrics online to get it all: the words are rather mumbled, great backing vocals.<br />The single `Jackie Brown' *(*) may seem like a good illustration for this album, but personally I find it too sad, even the violin is crying: it stands out because of its powerful images of poverty and offers no hope at all, whereas the rest of the album is more tinted with concern than desperation. BTW there is a newer version of this song on the 1999 album Rough Harvest, with warmer vocals and more upbeat tempo; maybe Mellencamp got depressed listening to the original.<br />It must be said that Big Daddy also houses some energetic tunes. On `Country Gentleman' ** the music is richer with some good clapping and at times gets loud and camouflages the words: doesn't matter, it is a critical portrait, the guy \\"just gonna help his rich friends\\" anyway, sings Mellencamp very matter-of-factly. `Theo and Weird Henry' *** is a tale of a friendship, the kind Springsteen might write, but the mood here is quite delicate somehow, though you can feel the smiling and the guitars driving the wheels of the old Ford van, a country-style leitmotiv that sticks in the head. I love `To Live' *** and its unusual start-and-stop structure: the dynamic parts get interrupted by some shy wordy sections sung very low, the vocals are pretty different to the way JM ordinarily sings, but it's about being confused, \\"a little lost\\", saying the wrong thing... I'd argue that \\"I'd rather fight with you than lay down and die\\" is a brilliant line.<br />`Martha Say' **** was released as a single, it's one of my very favourite Mellencamp's songs: the lyrics are entertaining, the vocals confident, and the tune has an infectious guitar riff; great for a party.<br /> `Sometimes A Great Notion' *(*) has a nice upbeat background, it's very reminiscent of Mellencamp's album The Lonesome Jubilee, but for the lyrics which bring in mind the opening track of his 2008 Life, Death, Love and Freedom: \\"Sometimes the best plans have been known to go astray. So, you better put your seatbelt on. Just like your worst headache, well, a bad day don't go away. And, you hit the ground running against your emotions.\\" Seems like JM has been torturing himself for a while...  even though he was only 38 in 1989, he sounds quite resigned about it all.<br />What about the single `Pop Singer' **(*)? Such a precursor to the following album Whenever We Wanted, Mellencamp's loudest: it's an aggressive track, it's tongue-in-cheek (\\"Never had no weird hair to get my songs over... Who would want to look into these eyes?\\") and it adds great variety to the album. It seems out of place, but the words state Mellencamp's dissatisfaction with the music business (just in case we thought he got used to his success in the mid-eighties) therefore it fits with the idea of looking at oneself in the mirror.<br />Big Daddy is in my top third of all 21 studio albums by John Mellencamp. I cannot recommend it more if you are interested in John Mellencamp's career, this album's got a touching vibe and is very revealing.<br /><br />For the record, I own all JM's albums. I have uploaded more reviews. I give **** max. to tracks I love, * to songs I feel are still worth listening to.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|I read a book, then cannot wait for the movie. This story was so interesting, I couldn't wait to get the movie, pop some popcorn, and enjoy the movie. I'll watch it again later this year and enjoy it just as much.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Just started the game, seems pretty good.Just getting used to the tablet style games so this might be easy for most but is kicking my rear.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Flowswell and kept my interest all the waythrough. Enjoyed it all the way through. The story line was fun to follow. I would definitely buy more games like this.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|The most appreciable fact about this book is how it narrates seemingly conflicting ideas in the city of Jerusalem with ease and similarity for all to understand. It unifies an ever-conflicting world with an ever-common philosophy, that everyone can relate to. Although, most of this work may not be original, rather than a collection of proverbs and notions, it is a great collection nonetheless. A must read.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The ending of this book took a drastic disjointed downturn. The resolution of the story seemed disconnected from the setup of the story...kind of like a Tyler Perry movie. The last 25% of the book needs to be rewritten.
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|First, I want to say that last year I got Anker's 15, 3A Dual USB port heavy duty car charger and I think it was(is) the best Dual Port USB charger on the market.  I WISH they still had it.  I apreciate the low profile and the ultra quick recharges even under heavy use! It has handled everything I've thrown at it.  I still have it, use it and love it.<br /><br />When I needed an additional charger for my other vehicle, I immediately went back to Anker and searched high and low to find a another one that I could buy - but unfortunately they do not seem to carry it any more.  I ended up settling on this one based on my prior experience with their product.<br /><br />I drive a lot and kept my Samsung S3 on this new charger daily (I use the phone as my GPS and a hot spot) and after two weeks of almost constant use it died.<br /><br />While it was working it did just ok.  It did charge my phone when i was just using it as a phone, but it did not maintain as high of a charge as the older one when I used the phone as a GPS or hotspot. Every day, starting with a full charge, after about 2 hours using the phone as a GPS and on this charger, my phone charge would dip to 50%, while the old charger maintains the charge at 95% or better under almost constant use.  So I was concerned that if I was using it for more than a few hours as I normally do on a daily basis, my phone would not have enough charge left to use as a hot spot once I got to my customers sites.  I did not get enough mileage on the new charger to find out whether I will consistently get enough charge or not.  But with what I have seen so far it does not look good.<br /><br />In any case, I'll be using the old one while contacting Anker for a replacement for the new one.<br /><br />I'll post an update after I get the new charger and use it for a while.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's been probably six years since I finished The Dark Tower, and that was the last King I read. This was the first thing to really grab my attention since, and needless to say it stands out in a big way against the rest of his work. Thoroughly researched and as much a history lesson on the late 50's and the Kennedy assassination as a horror novel, it never loses its pace or tension.
0761536434|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! So full of compelling anecdotes and it has a strong, cohesive narrative through our modern, video game era.  My only complaint, which is not really the book's fault, is that it ends in 2001 and of course, that means it misses out on the past couple generations of consoles.<br />That being said, I was reading this during the e3 xbone reveal and I'm amazed how relevant it remains through Microsoft's PR fiasco. Again, an interesting read and very fun, too.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Perhaps the best Bond film yet, but the resolution of this non-HD version is so poor that it looks like they smeared vaseline on the camera lens. We gave up after five minutes and ordered it in HD. Thing is, we often order films in less than HD format and they are fine. Problem is it is hard not to get charged for both- they don't like giving refunds for digital orders.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|The music delivers precisely what is needed to the eardrums. Heavy, melodic, with lyrics that make you want to believe everything that is spoken. Ozzy is the Man, and his iconic voice will be sorely missed and never replaced before the second coming.
B0013TPV0Q|4.0|My second David Sedaris book. Liked Let's Explore Diabetes With Owls better but this book was fun reading too. I've become curious about his real life like a mildly creepy voyeur. Sort of like him but without the talent to pen my musings.  If you're thinking about quitting cigarettes or if you've tried but failed or if you kicked the cancer stick habit, this book will bring out some sympathetic nods.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I think that this game is a learning g and experienced game doesn't everyone think that about some games. Not everyone has a laptop or kindale fire they have no electron Jcs they have real friends.
1848378963|4.0|It is interesting when reading books from this period to try to envision the attitude people had about women. Male and female authors of the era tend to make their female characters helpless idiots. This is one of those books that takes a while to build the personalities of the characters. The underlying plot is good and the ending has a twist that you don't expect.

B0058YPILY|5.0|I have all seasons!  I watch this DVD often!  I was very happy to find it on Amazon although once in awhile Criminal Minds is sold at Walmart stores!
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|We loved it! Great battle scenes and unexpected twists. However, it is the first of three, so the ending isn't as satisfying as you want it to be. It will be hard to wait for the sequels!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Nice tool to record our experience and to share with others.  I like it and my family is using it too.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|The characters are engaging.  It's fun to see how the villain softens up with the little girls.  Well done and enjoyable.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works well. Restored the edges to my K-Bar and Kershaw in seconds. Can't top a good old barber's wet stone but plenty good enough for all around use and much quicker and handier. Small enough for easy pocket carry.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|We enjoyed the movie.  The mixture of CGI and reality was interesting, and although James Franco is not a great actor, he is OK.  The plot had some twists that were surprising.  All in all, a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Enjoyable, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it. Corny jokes and some exciting steampunk action with good effects.
B009SKPVO8|5.0|If you're like me, the standard strap that comes with every new DSLR these days is slightly uncomfortable most of the time, and a literal pain in the neck the rest of the time. The standard straps are wide and pull right down on the critical muscles at the back of the neck, and they have this major steal me tag on them that says something along the lines of EOS DIGITAL or SONY.<br /><br />To solve these problems I went looking for something more comfortable. I saw this and had to give it a try.<br /><br />This strap attaches to the quarter inch threads on the bottom of the camera in the same position as a tripod mount would by a secure bolt and freely rotating loop of metal. The strap itself is a sturdy woven web with a padded section for your shoulder. When it's in place it evenly distributes the weight of the camera across the shoulder to prevent the pain associated with the neck strap. The only problem is the pad and its tendency to wander away from the shoulder due to the breathable mesh type construction of the interior side. As another reviewer mentioned, it would be nice if Case Logic would have included a gel section to help it stick, but this is a trivial issue.<br /><br />Aside from the comfort of this particular item, the functionality is a major upgrade from the standard neck strap. Previously, this expensive and heavy camera was allowed to hang at mid chest exposed to the world. With the shoulder sling the camera is able to traverse the length of the sling and rest at the hip, within reach of the security of a hand. This allows the camera to be mostly out of sight, and in a perfect position for safe keeping and quick access.<br /><br />Overall this is a great product that should be considered if you're looking to replace the standard strap that your camera came with and move on to something more convenient and more comfortable.
B00755MHXG|5.0|What a beautiful story!  It is written through the eyes of August, with chapters from the viewpoints of his sister and his friends.  August is going to school for the first time.  This is an extra challenge because as August says, his face is not \\"normal.\\"  August shares how he feels when people stare, and when they won't touch him and also when someone \\"just likes him.\\"  This is all set in an average class amongst average kids.<br /><br />This is a great book.  It is good for the kid who doesn't fit to read, take comfort and be inspired.  It is particularly good for kids who do fit in however, because it allows them to see life through the eyes of someone who is walking a different path to them.  As it opens their hearts and their eyes, it may lead them to want to find an pportunity to be kind. It is an honest book, sad in places, but also very hopeful.<br /><br />Our local school read it as a class in year 6 (12 year olds) and they loved it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I though it was ok not enough mini games could of been longer a little boring. It had a good enough story line.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|If you are looking for some Shakespeare type material, this won't be your movie. But, if you're just looking for a movie that makes you laugh sympathize  with some zombies, this is your movie! I was laughing constantly at the sarcasm in the movie. Great movie but like I said, very cheesy.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|They talk fast like they know what's going on and they sew scenes together with duck tape.  It was very annoying.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game with good challenges. Was well enjoyed by me and family. Was 've err y fun to play<br />Fantasticgame and the fun
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved this story! It was hilarious, but it certainly had a serious side to it. It was an easy read, great for a holiday. I learnt a lot as well, and it has stayed with me. Wouldn't  hesitate to recommend.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish it was longer only 8 levels. Update soon please I would love to keep playing. It shows more level s but they are locked.

B00CK6MUSW|5.0|I  thoroughly enjoyed this book. The interest was there right up to the end as it had a twist to the events.
B0054TKB8I|5.0|I love the series....it's worth watching. There's comedy and romance. A typical modern day drama. I'm so addicted that I stay up until 2am...
B00785P2QC|4.0|To pass the time and some great fun, this is hard to beat. Mini city tycoon fans will enjoy this.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The next two books in this series promise to be better than any of the others, but this one was amazing!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was a very good game. Nice story and background story and very good game play. Can't wait to find the second one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome book.  Anytime your having a bad day just pick this book up and read. He keeps you on edge on thinking what's next with Christen Gray.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Great autobiography of Chris Kyle and the life and trials  as  well as the sacrifices he made  in combat,  to his family, and his country as well as his fellow team members.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This movie was creative and well done.  One of the main characters was paralyzed - the other was a person with a past and no good prospects for the future.  No other prospective caretaker seemingly had seen the paralyzed man as a full person - magic happened when the two became friends.  I think the best films are those which teach us something valuable about life - this movie is a treasure.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|Just finished reading Susan Cain's wonderful book on introversion. I found it incredibly liberating. It's given me more peace of mind about who and how I am. I recommend to anyone who finds our extroverted world puzzling, tiresome and at times harsh and judgmental.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|.  Very good story line as well as developing characters, can't wait for the next<br />book in the series, any news on when it will be released?
B0000029AP|5.0|It is Aerosmith for cryin out loud. Gotta love it. I still love the music. Still love the vibe. Back to basics baby.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I own every Disney movie, in every media form they are available in, laser disk, vhs, dvd, bluray, and 3d bluray. I grew up with them, watched them with my kids, and now my grandkids. This is the the only one I feel I wasted my money on. Boring begining that does not develope any likability in James Franco. Low acting quality by all actors probably based on a poor script. Some nice color shots but a lot of the CGI appears poorly thought out. Save your money - rent it if you must - but you probably won't watch it more than once. Even though it is Disney look for the price to drop.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the first two books in the crossfire series, but this novel felt like it was rushed to publication to meet a deadline. It felt incomplete, and never gave me the arc of a full story in one novel. The sex scenes are hot and steamy for sure, but the characters didn't develop any more than they did the last time we saw saw them at the end of Book 2.
0790735431|5.0|I have always been a history buff and loved the history of the early air force and the Flying fortress.  The book is great!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this novel as good as the first one, maybe even better. The book is much better than a movie. It shows the character's thoughts and why she makes the decisions she does. Great book.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Catches your attention right from the beginning. If you like the Walking Dead tv show you will enjoy this book! Awesome read!!!
B0081336FO|4.0|I would have given this a five star, but I haven not seen the last episode yet. I advise anyone who likes mystery, comedy and romance to watch it.
B004GKMV3Y|3.0|I've read a lot of Sophie's books and have loved them & fallen deeply engrossed in the characters b<br />This book - the Wedding Girl - wasn't as good to read. The storyline was there and there was intrigue but all in the last third if the book. Not much happened in the first 2 thirds. You knew the characters but it didn't have that feeling of wanting to know more and see what happened to the characters when it finished.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show! I love the quirky personality of Sherlock and seeing how his mind works. This show has action, comedy and a hint of romance.
B008Y73940|4.0|I usually do not like this type of movie but it had alot of twists that made it worth watching.  I actually enjoyed it
B008JFUORW|1.0|\\"The Hangover Part III\\" is such a joyless, unhappy excuse for a film, it almost defies description. Almost.<br /><br />The key difference between \\"III\\" and the first two installments is that there is never a single moment in the film when the three characters played by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis seem happy to be together. In the first two films, there was at least the possibility of a good time at the bachelor party each film begins with. This moment helps illustrate their friendship and gives us a reason to go on these harrowing journeys with them. Yes, things go horribly wrong, but in the beginning, they are happy and excited. In \\"III\\", the reason for their trip is very different and they all seem to dread the very idea of the journey which doesn't help the film get off to a good start.<br /><br />In \\"III\\", Alan (Galifianakis) has not been taking his meds leading to even more erratic behavior than in the previous films. When his actions lead to a pretty irresponsible, unsettling event, his family decides to have an intervention and Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) agree to drive Alan to a rehab facility in Arizona. On the way, Marshall (John Goodman), a gangster, has his men run the friends off the road. He takes Doug as a hostage and will return him if the other three find Chow (Ken Jeung), who has just escaped from a Thai prison. Chow stole $20 million in gold bars from the gangster and he wants it back. They hit the road and travel from Arizona to Tijuana before finally ending up back in Vegas. Along the way, they get into dangerous situations, people get hurt and killed, animals die, all in the pursuit of finding the gold and returning it. These situations aren't inherently funny and even the cast and crew seem to realize this because everything is played straight, leading to a bad impression of an action film.<br /><br />Seriously, the only person who even seems to be attempting something funny is Galifianakis. He takes the man-child character he always plays to familiar places, places already explored with much more energy and vitality by John Candy, Jim Belushi, Chris Farley and others. This type of humor is, for me, best served in small doses. When the character and behavior are prevalent throughout the entire film, everything in the narrative seems dumb, just dumb, not smart-funny dumb. It is much harder to do smart-funny dumb, which is why we so seldom see it, and why so many comedies are completely forgettable.<br /><br />Cooper and Helms grimace and frown their way through the entire film. And they have a right to, because they are in one dangerous situation after another. Hopefully, the large sequel-sized paycheck each received made up for this unpleasant experience. But what about our unpleasant experience? Who will pay us? We have to pay to sit and watch this dreck. That seems backward somehow.<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that director Todd Phillips envisioned these films as a trilogy; when the first one made so much money, the plans for II and III were born. The phenomenal success of the first led to a virtual copycat set in a different country. Now, with the \\"Epic Conclusion\\", he changes the format of the film. Initially, this is a welcome idea - \\"II\\" was a hollow retread of the first film - but why make this film at all if you can't figure out a way to incorporate, in some way, the original idea? Basically, the only connection between the three films is the characters. Everything in this film happens moving forward, so the initial shock of seeing an outrageous moment and then learning about the circumstances leading up to it is gone. I suppose Alan killing a giraffe and the aftermath of this situation is meant to stand in for the bachelor party scene, but it is simply shocking and grimace-inducing. It just isn't funny.<br /><br />Phillips is a mixed bag as a director. He's done some good films (\\"Old School\\", \\"The Hangover\\") but most of his films are jaw-droppingly bad.<br /><br />The road trip element of the story allows the narrative to return to Vegas and bring back some of the memorable characters from the first film; the boys visit Heather Graham's character at her new home. Her former hooker is now leading a respectable life with a new husband. The inclusion of this scene is just bizarre. It really isn't needed which leads to the question \\"why is it included?\\" To give all of Heather Graham's fans another look? Does she even have fans anymore? So the scene is not only unnecessary but boring.<br /><br />How bad does a movie have to be when even Melissa McCarthy isn't funny? McCarthy pops up in a cameo. This is the first time I have not laughed at one of her cameos or performances. Her character is simply mean which is supposed to be a mirror image of Alan's treatment of others, but that doesn't work either. A mirror image of something that doesn't work is also something that doesn't work.<br /><br />There are a number of incidents involving animals. In each, the animal is drugged, harmed or killed. Is this supposed to be funny? I think it is sort of sad. Everytime an animal pops up, something happens to them. In the other two films, animals make appearances and the level of harm played out on these creatures throughout the series seems gratuitous and out of proportion. Were the animals actually harmed during the filmmaking? No. But depicting these moments as `comedy' just seems wrong. Very wrong.<br /><br />When the story finally gets to Vegas, the three men regard the opportunity to revisit the iconic city with palpable dread. They eventually learn that Chow is holed up in a penthouse at Caesar's Palace. Alan refers to the resort as a `hell-hole'. When they finally make it to the hotel, there is an extended sequence featuring acrobatics from the penthouse. My question is: Did Las Vegas and Caesar's Palace partner with the producers to make this film? Neither is painted in a very positive light. If you had your product featured in a film and someone referred to it as a `hell-hole' would you be happy? It might very well seem like an awful place to the characters, but none of this is remotely funny and seems like a stupid waste of time.<br /><br />And on that note, I don't want to waste any more of our time on a movie that is essentially a complete waste of time.ngly bad.<br /><br />The road trip element of the story allows the narrative to return to Vegas and bring back some of the memorable characters from the first film; the boys visit Heather Graham's character at her new home.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|I loved this season. Sheldons Charactor seemed to go back to his introduced personality in season one but with a little bit more sympathetic towards others feelings rather than his own. Howards character has never been funnier while he is in space and Raj tends to grow as a person. Great season!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini's deeply woven literary mosaic is, at its core, a novel about family.  It's a novel about the threads that bind people through time and space, those threads that continue to extend, to be woven more deeply with every experience and every interaction.<br /><br />This story begins with a boy, Abdullah, his sister Pari, and their love for one another.  They are separated, and in that separation the foundation for this story is built.  Every event propels us the only way we can move through life, and that is... forward. Hosseini moves us in that direction through time depicting the lives of people whose connections aren't always entirely obvious at first but who become as interesting as two that started it all.<br /><br />Some have criticized this book because of the narrative complexities created by Hosseini.  I see it as a masterpiece.  The movement of the novel shifts not only throughout time but from person to person, perspective to perspective, life to life.  In these shifts the connections may not always be apparent at first, but I encourage you not to be discouraged.  Keep reading, and you will eventually see the threads.  The beauty in this technique is that you can read this novel multiple times and gain new insights with every one.  It would be impossible to take it all in on the first read.<br /><br />Regardless of how you feel about a given character, this book will offer perspective.  It is unique. It will resonate with you.

Please, keep this product in stock because I will, I guarantee that I will continue to buy even more of these regardless of how many I have purchases in the past. As a matter of fact, I have another 3 of these in my cart waiting to be bought. I will be buying this again.

B00C7KYXHW|4.0|If you are familiar with any of the previous works on Hannibal Lecter, whether they are books by Thomas Harris or the movies, you will probably enjoy this series. The way this show plays out has a really distinctive &#34;feel&#34; to it, a particular style that won't make you feel like you've seen this before.<br /><br />However, I must admit, even though I like the dismal subjects that the main character has to deal with, I do not like how his empathetic process seems so willy-nilly. Honestly, how can an FBI agent track down multiple serial killers based on how he &#34;feels&#34; about the methodology of the crimes, and what kind of victims were targeted? There were moments in the show where a scientific, objective approach was used to analyze the murders, but I need more of those moments to be convinced about the brilliancy of Will Graham. Of course, it's not just about Will Graham, but also Hannibal and a slew of other characters. Mads Mikkelsen does a great job as Hannibal Lecter, but I guess since I was used to Anthony Hopkins and Gaspard Ulliel, it takes a bit to get used to this new Hannibal. Not that it's bad, it's actually great and definitely worth your time if you're looking for horror and suspense.<br /><br />All and all, if you like detective stories featuring a number of grotesque cases, this show is a wonderful choice for you to take up.
034580404X|3.0|I say read it for the love story - not the hype and you will come out with a better attitude. After hearing so much hype about the books I finally decided to give them a try. I went in expecting this great story and was so pissed after book one. I agree with others that say the story became repetitive and was streched out way to long. I had to reread them and focus on the love story to get over my initial disappointment.<br />A quick overview - The first book they meet and start sexing. Second book they move on to more sexing and relationship issues. Third book continued sexing and relationship issues after marriage. Same old love story that people love to hear and buy. Young naive poor down to earth girl meets older rich wordly guy. Rich guy spoils poor girl by trying to give her the world. Poor girl doesn't want rich guy buying her things but quickly learns to like the finer things in life. Don't we all :).<br />Another reason these books are so popular is the sex. You have a lot of people who want to release their most vivid sex fantasies and are scared of what others might think so they hide behind closed doors with books and magazines. Yet, again the sex in the books are disappointing because they are the same sex scenes over and over. I was expecting some freaky freak to eventually happen but it never did. Just two people having sex with a little kinkiness which is the norm in 2013 if you want to keep him interested. I've read better sex scenes in True Confessions magazine back in the 80s.<br />So I give 3 stars for the love story because what girl doesn't want a rich guy who only has eyes for her to try and buy her the world. We love these stories and the publishers know we do so they will continue to sale them.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|After three Sophie Kinsella's books I now consider her to be one of my favorite authors. Twenties Girl was such a fun read that I never wanted it to be over. It is a love story, a mystery, drama and comedy all rolled up in one. This book literally had me laughing so hard one morning, I was afraid I was going to wake the entire household and other times I found myself grabbing the tissues to wipe away the tears that were streaming down my face.<br /><br />The main characters were so quirky, zany and endearing. Lara and Sadie were definitely people I would love to hang out with. My favorite character was Sadie the ghost. Her story was heart wrenching and the relationship she built with her great-niece, Lara, after her death was beautiful and hilarious. The things Sadie had Lara do were terribly funny but something close girlfriends would definitely do.<br /><br />Twenties Girl is sure to put a smile on your face, tears in your eyes and warm your heart. If I could give this book 10 stars I would. This is a chick-lit must read.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My whole family loves to play this game..I love how it's not only fun but educational for my daughter's and I have even learned things I didn't know before.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is an amazing game.  My favorite genre is the action rpg, dungeon crawling style.  This game take me back to the days I'd play Baulder's gate, The Bards' s Tale, and Champions of Norrath on the PS2.  I have The Bards Tale app as well as this and I couldn't be more thrilled to have my favorite type of games on hand for me to play wherever I go.  Great job!
B0018RC7QE|5.0|I came across this movie while just perusing the latest free releases on Amazon Prime.  As I'm definitely not a huge fan dramatic love stories or of even most of the chick-flicks, this one immediately interested me because the two primary actors are and have been in my top list of all-time great artists of their field: Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep.<br /><br />So, quietly alone in my home, with my family still asleep at 6:15am on a Sunday morning, I queued it up and watched these two actors take this low-key but very spontaneous route to love.<br /><br />The characters they play, Frank and Molly, are just like most of the rest of us who are somewhat happily married and aren't looking to start extra-marital relationship.  However, fate intervenes into their lives with chance encounters that aren't planned for a number of months.  These chance encounters allow Frank and Molly to slowly become friends and then over those months, they come to each other through very different paths and reasons.  As in all love stories, real life or on the big screen, we all have been drawn to someone who fulfills a need, desire or emotion that brings your life into balance again.<br /><br />This isn't one of Hollywood's typical, lust filled marital affair where the need for both is based around just sex. Their encounters are short snippets of their time away from their homes and the director allows you to fill in the missing pieces of their time together and with their respective spouses.  This intelligent form of film making is the crux of how you can imagine what a random and spontaneous this love story unfolds.<br /><br />Both Molly and Frank do let their spouses know however it's still low key and up to your own to determine exactly how those relationships become part of their paths and still in your minds eye how Frank and Molly become finally one with each other.<br /><br />Acting by Meryl and Robert rate above 5 stars for this movie.<br /><br />The director, Ulu Grosbard, of Belgian descent and who passed away last year at age 83, gets a higher than 5 star rating too.  I say this because he took this story, which on its surface, would be lame in the hands of some directors of this genre and made it into one of my now favorite movies all time.

B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Cleverly made and reminiscent of the original story yet supposedly a composite of all his other books.<br />The picture was beautiful, especially in Blu-Ray.  I'm not crazy about the casting, but I'd let that pass and only give it a four star instead of five.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I think this movie put together some pieces for the Bourne series. It is more intelligent than the previous three. The action is great. What I would DREAM of is for Matt Damon to get on board again and the TWO of them do a Bourne movie!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I've read ALL of Patricia Cornwell's books, but I think this may be the last. Plots, characters, etc. are no longer able to capture nor hold my interest.  I find myself longing for those first days of being so vested while I read one of her books that my heart would race from the suspense or I would be totally surprised by a twist of events.  So sad our reading time together has come to an end. :(
0553801473|5.0|I am still reading this one, but am enjoying it very much. It is a great story, and I am hoping there will be more to the story.

B009UNGYHG|5.0|A wonderful addition to the headset! The magnetic latch makes it so easy to both store, protect, and charge.<br /><br />The only slight pain is having to rotate the headset flat each time but I see nothing they could do other than make the case way too large. Not a big deal.<br /><br />I love that the case takes a standard micro USB even if the headset does not.
B000UMXCTY|5.0|Like I said in the title I'm so glad I bought this collection instead of a greatest hits album. I'm only 32 so I wasn't around to hear them while they were making music together so I only really new their hits from the radio and greatest hits collections but I've discovered that they have so many amazing songs that I think are better than a lot of their popular hits. All their songs for the price I paid was a huge bargain too so I couldn't be happier with this purchase, absolutely love them!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I just loved it. Season 6 takes us on so many twists and turns that your mind is always engage.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is wonderful. keeps your mind engaged. would highly recommend this game to all great for adults and kids alike
B003FSTN52|5.0|Each episode of The Good Wife presents a realistic legal case.  The context of the case allows expression of the attorneys personal lives, the interplay amongst the attorneys, the power struggles within the law firm, legal and political maneuvering, and the interface with the Courts.  Front and center is Julianna Margulies who convincingly portrays the wife of an elected official who has been incarcerated as a result of scandal involving unlawful use of office and sexual infidelity.  Julianna struggles with her public embarrassment, questions regarding the future of her marriage, and managing her two children simultaneously with her legal career as an associate in a high profile Chicago law firm.  The show portrays quite well the vested interests and hidden agendas operating on both sides of the law.  The scenarios are for the most part serious, however, there is often subtle humor sprinkled throughout.  The plots of each episode are intriguing with the Law firm always seeming to have superior investigative powers compared to the police.  This series entertains and leaves you looking forward to the next episode.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|The settings, the colors were absolutely beautiful..really could not turn my head away for one second in case I missed something.The story was also well written, but don't look for any characters from the &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; you won't find them.Some of the parts were a little frightening for young children.....even though it is a Disney production.
B000274THQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite German films. I think it is a great film to use if you want to introduce someone to German cinema.
B00992CF6W|1.0|7.9 sucks cause i put in my password and email correct and is says wrong email and password like what what what the heck did you say and when i go to forget my password it shows the screen for about one second and the goes to this page where you can regester and taped on that and again showed the screen for one second and back to the same regester page
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a twist of temple run and their own design. I personally like it better than temple run itself. I also like how you don't have to tilt, when I play temple run I am at an angle, subway surfers I don't.<br />  I looked at the reviews for temple run and subway surfers and about 83 percent of temple run glitch more than subway surfers. I recommend you buy this game.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Great movie, highly recommend watching in 3D.  Wish the disk contained a regular cd as well though but the movie do not miss it!
B00003CXMG|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  I watch this movie over and over again and love it more each time.  The movie takes place in the late 60's/early 70's (when I was growing up).  I love the clothes, music, and feel of this movie.  It's the type of film that both sexes will enjoy.  Casting is fabulous.  Give this a try, you won't be sorry!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|wow, i was hooked from the very first episode.  Amazingly good show. I'm addicted to e-mail, and usually can't get through an hour of TV without looking at my e-mail 10 times!  But with True Blood, I forget about everything else!
B001AQQR2S|5.0|kids loved it, watched 3 times in a row, especially the 5 and 8 year olds.  The book was read in class during lunch and he recalls the plots when watching the movie.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|Altogether a good movie, hard to follow in some parts because the film is based in Russia and there are some subtitles.  Other than that, it has a good plot and great action.  Makes you wonder if there will be more Die Hards??
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Great movie, perfect for just about anyone and certainly the best of the series.  Josh Brolin does a perfect K.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|So inspirational!! I'm glad I read this the summer before my MBA program starts. Sheryl gives great advice to all men and women; her book brings a lot of &#34;less discussed&#34; topics and issues to the surface! Great read!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This review was required so....<br /><br />The movie is great, I love the price I got it for, it shipped very fast and arrived very quickly and of course, it played great.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|This is a fun addictive game that is ruined by the annoying ads for the publishers other games. This is supposed to be the &quot;premium&quot;  version, yet ads pop over at inopportune times after loading screens. This sometimes causes the game to crash and refuse to to reload until you re boot the device. I will not install any other appade by this publisher due to this.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|My daughter introduced me to the books and I recently finished the final book in the quartet.  We had planned on going to see this movie at the theater when it came out.  Thank goodness we didn't waste the money or time.  I watched about 20 minutes and had to stop.  I literally could not get beyond the mediocre acting and poorly scavenged script.  I will not be renting or paying money for sequels.  They maligned the original story so much, I can't imagine how they would make subsequent movies work.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Seemed a bit odd to me that there was nothing included with the Kindle Fire - at least, nothing I could find - which would let me write anything for later reference, with the exception of composing an email.  But sure enough, this app was waiting to be added, and it is beautifully designed.  Really nice.
0345525558|5.0|I loved the characters and the entire story-line. It had its little twists and turns that I really enjoyed. Loved it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|you have to read it! without a doubt. this is my favorite trilogy by far, so much tension and sex and it's just so goddamn hot
1439153663|5.0|Interesting book.. liked that it was told by two of the main characters.  Interesting historical places. A good read for anyone.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|This is an okay movie, not good, not bad. If you have some free time to kill it's worth a watch but I wouldn't suggest buying it.
B001NA6096|5.0|A moving story of a random meeting and connection between two people spending an evening together before going separate ways. While being a movie, it dives into real dialogue and explores a genuine connection between two people that leaves you wanting to know what happens after. Loved this film!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Unlike the Kite Runner, this will be easily forgotten. I was so excited to read it but the story and characters disappointed in the end.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|These games are very addictive. I start playing and realize 3 hrs has passed. Can't wait to do more. Would recommend to anyone.
044024630X|5.0|My son requested manyof the lee child books..he finally started really enjoying reading..so ofcourse I bought him several..! HE said the books are all filled with suspence and drama!<br />A+
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Great movie to sit down with the the wife! Loved it full of suspense. Although we've seen this title before its a must see and would watch again. We thought we never seen it and when we realized we did we were glued to the screen
B0026NBZDU|3.0|I read this book and Tipping The Velvet, I like them both but not sure I'd recommend them to anyone. Both of her novels, that I've read, seem to be sad and depressing... tragic almost... until the very end.
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|i wanted to buy this film , it has a good cast, starting with natalie portman and jake gyllenhaal, i recomenfded it is a good movie with a good drama
B001NLKT60|4.0|I liked girl with the dragon tattoo and decided to read the series. This is as long and detailed as the first book so I'd only recommend it to patient readers that don't mind Stieg Larsson's style of writing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The Kindle book reader is a true marvel, and when combined with a true adventure story like &#34;No Easy Day&#34; it just makes for one fine reading experience.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I liked the first two books in the series and had to read the Last. This is as long and detailed as the first two book so I'd only recommend it to patient readers that don't mind Stieg Larsson's style of writing.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Love all of Geo. RR Martins books, and especially the &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; quartet.  Great adventure story, but Geo. RR uses so many strange names and places, it is very, very hard to keep up.  There need to be glossery maybe with maps every few pages just so I could keep with characters and place.  All said, I will definitely buy the next installment.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book! If you liked the first book then I'd recommend the entire series. Just like the first book There are children fighting and dying so probably not for the young reader.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Geo R.R. Martin continues the &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; adventure and it is great reading fun.  I still have the same problem with his works that I've had since the first book of his I ever read.  He has so many characters and locations, it is hard, hard to keep up.  All said, I will be first in line for the next installment.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you liked the first two books then you will like this one as well! There is fighting and dying so probably not for the younger reader.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|What is not to love if you are a true Black Sabbath fan.  Their classic sound with a little bit of new added to it.
0307949486|4.0|Stieg Larsson's writing style is long and detailed so if you aren't a patient reader then you probably won't like this book or the other two. If you choose not to read this book, there was a US and foreign movie made... I recommend the foreign one.
030758836X|2.0|NY Times bestselling author? The quality of the writing in this book is marginal - much like \\"Fifty Shades\\". I noticed the misuse/overuse of a word that's popular these days - \\"literally.\\" Reminds me of the days of \\"totally\\" in the 70's. I kept track as I read & the word is used 21 times - most of them incorrectly. Don't waste your time. There is better literature out there.
