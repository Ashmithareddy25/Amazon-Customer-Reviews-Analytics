B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a great game but it has a few drawbacks, other than that it's really fun. Another great Gameloft game.
B000VZGK3K|5.0|I love every single aspect of this movie, from Leo's performance and even Blanchett's performance, to the editing and the script.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book! Lots of twists and turns and anticipation. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested crime and mystery.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|I'm not going to lie, I did enjoy this film at least the 1st time I saw it. But after that, it loses all its value. Visually, it's a gorgeous movie, as is standard with Zack Snyder. But the script and acting don't do anything for me.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is fun. Not the typical win overnight game.  I like building, so it works for me. I enjoy looking at the petty scenery.
B001VNB54A|5.0|If you loved Band of Brothers, you should fall in love with this as well. It's not as great as BOB, but that probably owes more to the setting of the series rather than anything about the production, script, and actors themselves.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was eloquently written.  What a superb read.  The story was fantastic.  I would recommend to anyone.  Twists and turns and a great ending.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Traditionally, the 1st season of a TV show is the best, and Mad Men is no exception. I could watch this multiple times.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Our family loved Lilo & Stitch and can't wait to watch the sequel!  We would highly recommend this movie for a rainy summer afternoon or movie night.
B00284BNKC|5.0|This is a captivating film that does a wonderful job of showing the nature of addiction and drugs. Some of the most exciting editing I've ever seen in a film as well.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I LOOVE EPIC !!! My little ones like to play my kindle every day just because of this game. Keeps them occupied while I'm cooking dinner! VERY GOOD GAME
B004V8W54Q|5.0|Amazing movie! It is a stimulating surrealist masterpiece and delectably aggressive satire of modern society.<br />The blu-ray was worth its price. Quality is great. Was shipped on time and as described. Would buy from this seller again.<br /><br />Definitely earned five stars!
1601251831|5.0|Beasts! Most modals will use the majority of their beasts from this book. Awesom for stats and main descriptions of monsters and such there like.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|While not a big twitter user I DL'd it on my Kindle Fire and it works well. Does all it is supposed to.
B00004YTIQ|3.0|once it was on it works, was not dark like pictures it is clear and no matter how tight you try and make it theres no way to get it snug and tight across the top like its pictured, it droops into the water.
0979019710|5.0|I love this book. I was one of the most anti-morning people ever, but Hal's book gives so much weight and reason for waking up early that I am actually excited to become an early riser! This is a book that gives you a program for starting all of those good habits that you haven't quite gotten around to yet (spending time in meditation/prayer, affirmations, visualization, exercise, reading, and journaling). All great people have early morning routines, and if you're trying to get clarity in your life, or are trying to find an effective way to become an early riser, then this book is a must. I got the audio book but I will get the paperback version too. I tell all my friends about the Miracle Morning. Along with Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill (whom Hal is inspired by) and Creative Visualization by Shakti Gawain, this is one of the best self help books I've ever come across.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I got hooked on Gillian Flynn with Gone Girl, but this one wasn't quite as strong. It dragged a bit here and there, and the final &#34;reveal&#34; was a little flat. Not terrible by any stretch, but not nearly as engrossing as the other two Flynn novels.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|I absolutely love this production of the Ring Cycle by the Met Opera House.  Personally, I think the stage is amazing, especially how they integrate it into the play to create the different settings and special effects.  It's very creative.  The music and singing is outstanding.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was incredibly addictive - couldn't put it down. Engrossing format, characters, and story. Easy, quick, and satisfying read. Buy today.
0156030306|5.0|I orignally purchased this book for a class I was taking in college because I had to but I am very glad I did! It's a great book! I lent it to a couple others and they all loved it as well!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn writes flawed characters very well, and this one is very solid. Some disturbing images, great twists, engrossing characters. Great work.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|I found Food Inc. A Rober Kenner film very informative. It does sadden me that humans will choose wealth over the health of other humans. What has this country come to? Big Goverment playing both sides, the good and the evil. Big companies only caring about reaching their next big money goal. Sometimes just when you think you can't do anything you can. Take back your health before it is to late. Become informed and change the way you think and eat.
B007R3B4RG|5.0|After Joey's posthumous solo album in 2002, I didn't really have high expectations when this album came out 10 years later. I was wrong. This album blows away that 2002 album (I hate to say it, but that album was, eh. Not good not bad, just eh.) Check out \\"Rock 'n Roll Is The Answer\\", \\"Make Me Tremble\\", or \\"Waiting For That Railroad\\". We still miss you Joey, Ya Know?
B009J2VQSK|5.0|I love all the songs contained in the CD, and is now my favorite movie, enjoy it. Thanks.. Best Regards.
B009AMAGXK|5.0|So much was left out from the book and to really appreciate this movie you must read the book series otherwise you will find it boring
B006LSZECO|5.0|Had heard about this but couldn't get it at the library unless I wanted to wait endlessly.  Therefore, i got it and it was indeed a good mystery with characters who need slapping badly.
B00C5ZORES|3.0|Okay, I like Fall Out Boy a lot. But That is not the right title for the album.  The CD isn't rock. I think it is softer than most of their stuff, actually. I guess I don't hate the CD, but not what I was expecting.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I've had totemo for about 1 week and I've reached level 75. It can be fairly boring after awhile, but it does make you focus and give it a lot of thought. The music puts you to sleep. The graphics have received great reviews, but I just don't see it. I'm a competitive person so I just can't stop playing. I turned off the sound, so I wouldn't have to listen to it or the weird little man's strange language. Of course, I'm not a teenager,so you might understand my complaints.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Goes to show how our thoughts will determine our destiny. Glad to recommend this book. I was eager to pick up where  I left off interestingly.
1451648537|5.0|What more can you say? It's Steve Jobs. A wonderful book, a great read. Bought the hardcover book, the audiobook, and the ebook. As I said, love it!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It was the perfect solution to the problem of Kindle not charging.  Thank you so much for your help and assistance.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Wow, I was not prepared for all f*** words, nudity and nothing left to the imagination sex. That was the first half hour. I turned it off. I heard good reviews so I wanted to see it. The actors are all A+ and imagination for the story and graphics looked amazing. There is no reason to add all that stuff and tell a good story too. Next time I will do a more thorough critics search.
0811879542|5.0|I heard about this book and bought it sight unseen.  The book enthralls children of all ages with its great design and funny premise.  It is interactive in the best sense of the word.  Buy this book.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I can not state more than has been already said by so many others. do not waste your time or money with this horrible book. The books took a turn for the worse whenever the show came out and for the first time in the history of my life I will say that the show is in fact better than the book.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Good free game.  You can spend a lot of time playing this game. I found it to be very fun. Wish it went past level fifty. However, some levels were very tough.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Absolutely amazing game and the only downside was minor. When you get in a 1V.1 game you nearly always win. Bane better fear Batman in another great game by gameloft.
B000Q67876|5.0|One of the greatest movies that didn't get enough buzz because of Forrest Gump.<br />The  movie incorporates everything about Hollywood without coming off cheesy.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|The Great War and its horrific battles have been written about too many times to tell.  What makes &#34;The Sleepwalkers&#34; unique is the story of dysfunctional dynasties and secret diplomacy that led to unintended consequences.  Also the ill advised move against vital interests of Japan and subsequent defeat of Russia combined with Russian humiliation from interference in Morocco led to a lit fuse on the powder keg of Europe.  This book details the importance of short term thinking that led to the Great War as much as dreadnought rivalry and self-interested armament manufacturers.<br /><br />Even today we seem to make similar mistakes in all countries with diplomatic secrecy and lack of willpower.  We can only hope the &#34;end game&#34; is not like 1914.  &#34;The Sleepwalkers&#34; is a must read if you want to understand how bad diplomacy can lead to needless tragedy of war.  Also the book is well written and coherent - a history buff's top shelf treasure.
B008JEJVXG|5.0|Music really is all about personal taste so go check it out on the youtubez land.<br />It's real good. Even how the physical album is put together is quality.<br />I would buy this album again just to own the physical album.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Is must say that this was a great deal of fun.  I collect puzzle boxes and read mysteries of all genres. This challenge was more than I expected and a complete enjoyment. HINT - we lovers of puzzles get trapped in our individual ways of seeing things...try not to do that! :-)
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is the second  one that I have had and I  just love them.  I  can't use a broom because the sweeping motion hurts my back  and the  swivel  sweeper is perfect  for me.  They  pick up  just about everything.
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|Trekie fan here. Koodos to the writers, directors and cast of the new Star Trek movies. Getting my 9 year olds involved in the wonderful world of Star Trek. They loved Star Trek I & (now) II so thought I'd introduce them to the original movies and this is the first one I let them watch.  I forgot how many references the new movie made to this one. They were able to follow the story (with some explanation of some parts... like why did they put worms in their ears??) and link it to the new movie.  Would recommend highly to old and new Star Trek fans alike.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|It's a great app. I love that it has lots of songs all for free. Right now songs that you usually have to buy you could het here for free. I really like that, especially since I'm.thirteen. Great app.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|great quality, quick downloading, and amazing storyline. I love it and this is literally the only place i'd buy episodes from
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|this movie is awsome. it it is the best family movie of the year. who ever hasent seen this movie you should definitely buy it . who agrees withme that its a great movie. wreck it ralph is a great movie for kids.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Fast turnaround; product as described; very pleased and will order from again: movie itself was disappointing---Tom Hanks was fabulous, as usual, but the storyline didn't come together quite as smoothly
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is really cool. I love it. I like to challegne my friends too. :) Its so cool. Itsa relly good app.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|Mark Wahlberg is a awesome actor not to mention his body is lovely.  Watched this movie with my boyfriend and it was great.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My brother absolutely loves Jurassic park so I thought I'd download it for him... and now we are both addicted to playing it lol... seriously should try this game!!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I love this album! The music is varied, and it's all very good. I recommend to any Carrie Underwood fan.
0553582038|5.0|It says, &#34;5-stars&#34; and &#34;I love it&#34; but that's my wife talking. She's hooked and if she's happy then I'm happy.
B0036TGT3E|3.0|I got the movie when I expected. I have always seen on amazon where people had received used items. Well, this was the first time I had received a used item. The case was broken and when we sat to watch it, the caption that popped up when I hit play was \\"You've started this title. Would you like to start over or resume where you left off?\\" This will make me think twice from reordering from amazon.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love it!!!! Awesome driving simulater. Good graphics too. Is exactaly the same as on Ipad. Awesome game. developers did great.
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|just loved this book and all the rest of them too! cant wait for last book to come out. this is a great read
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I loved the book and the insight into that of a Quadraplegic victim. Clark was a sassy girl and  loved her initiative to help him enjoy the final few months of his life.<br />Great reading and well written.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This man's voice is truly like no other!!  This CD always puts me in such a lovely place. I play it over and over!!  Thank you David Foster!!
B001EBWIUO|3.0|Can't believe that the bandits wouldn't recognize the bags of gold dust and gold nuggets.  These morons dumped twenty thousand dollars on the trail.  Also, can't believe that the gold dust would blow away that quickly, since gold is a heavy element.
1451695195|5.0|The book is very much in depth...sometime medical information was more than I understood, but still appreciated all his comments.<br />Love reading about these experiences.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app i use to play it on my ipod but now i can finally play it on my kindle
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone.  It's awesome.  Listening to him brings back memories from many years ago.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book started off very well.  One third way through the plot twists were riveting.  Half way through I was annoyed and by the end I regretted the time wasted reading it.  I had no sympathy or appreciation for any of the characters.  I was really rooting the the two lead characters to kill each other on the last page, but no they drifted off the rest of their lives.  After the reviews I was truly surprised.  I must be a different kind of reader.
0375842209|5.0|I found this book to be  hauntingly beautiful and inspiring.  When I was a girl I had a ceramic plaque on my wall that read &#34;There is not enough darkness in all the world to put out the light of one small candle&#34;.  That one small candle shone brightly through every page of this book and even the darkest, most terrifying events of the Nazi war machine could not snuff out its glow.  I was often moved to tears as love was chosen over hate, courage over fear and hope over despair.  As Victor Frankl showed  in &#34;Man's Victorious Spirit&#34;, there is something in each of us that is bigger than our worst nightmare.  Do yourself a favor and read and savor this wonderful book.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Chapter 32 need I say more!!! Again reading this book for the umpteenth time did not disappoint!!! Love love love cat and bones!!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This is a fun sonic screwdriver. It writes well, lights up, an the parts are nicely interchangeable. I wish there was a way to light it up without the noise, though, as the noise can quickly get annoying. Overall good toy and my daughter - a huge Dr. Who fan - absolutely loves it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I read Marcus Lutrell's Lone Suvivor after reading the late Chris Kyle's American Sniper and then Mark Owen's No Easy Day. I've thoroughly enjoyed all three titles, but probably rate Luttrell's as the most riveting, most scathingly on point in criticizing the American left, and my favorite recent read in general. Highly recommended!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT I ORDERED THIS BUT NEVER HAVE HAD ACCESS TO IT.I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE I ORDERED GAMES BEFORE.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when you think you've figured out where the story is heading there is another turn.  Author has a talent for engaging the reader and keeping them guessing throughout!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book really opened my eyes to the challenges we face as women in society and also what we can do to overcome them. The critics forming a lynch mob have a right to their opinions but instead of making the author look bad they end up making themselves look petty and ignorant. Ignore the critics!  Read this book!
B00BUELP9U|5.0|This looks vastly better than the USA letterboxed DVD which was overexposed, shaky, and washed out. The picture is very sharp, bright, steady, and clear with deep blacks and rich but subdued colors. English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and closed captions. Several dubs and subtitle options. Not a lot of extras - no commentary track, just the teaser, trailer, and short featurette. The picture was restored and remastered very recently, this Blu-ray was released in February 2013. The movie looks brand new with no dirt or film damage. Very light grain.  You can get this under 20 with shipping on eBay.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|When The Great Gatsby hit the theaters a few weeks ago, the younger generation was unaware of the original version.  Lucky for me that I was able to  share the &#34;greater&#34; Gatsby with them.  What a treat to see it again. Thanks
B008JFUORW|5.0|True fans of this movie will both enjoy and hate this movie. They will enjoy this movie because it fun and entertaining, but hate it because it's done. Knowing that this will no longer go on, they made ME extremely sad. This movie was very well planned out and was not as sexual as the previous ones, although the after credit scene was (which I did not see because I did not know) Anyway I love this trilogy and if you are true loyal fans, you will also enjoy it. Goodbye to the Wolf Pack, you will be missed.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Awesome!! fantasic!! Wonderful!!! Freaking Hilarious!!!!!! Thirlling!!!!!! SEXY!!!! BEAUTIFUL!!! Seductive!!! Refreshing!!! Passionate!!!! Delightful!!!!!! Fascinating!!! Incredible!!! Splendid!!! Outstanding!!! Sizzling!! Amazing!! Heartwarming!!! Charming book***********
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Great tie in to the castle series. I'm buying the next book I'm hooked. Much better then first book due to the fact he covered both set of character's events. great writing.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I did not know these two genres would combine so well... but after beating the game I have to say this is a match made in heaven. Awesomely old school, fun to play, all around great game. Keep up the good work!
B00C8985DU|3.0|This would be my 5th or 6th copy of this CD since it was released on CD in the 80's, and the sound is very good! Excellent remastering! I've been collecting all the box sets Paul has been releasing (29 to go!) But the prices on each box set are as different from each other as night and day. RAM was a pretty extensive collection and it was 70 dollars cheaper than this set. I could have done without the Humphrey Ocean sketch book, the 8X10 additional photos were one of Paul in color in action and two B&W shots of the backs of the band waving or looking out a window. You couldn't find a couple of nicer band shots than those? And the photos in one of the other books were printed looking like they really didn't care all that much-at least not as much as the photos printed for McCartney and McCartney 2. It was nice to see the TV special again after wearing out my VHS tape sometime in the 80's. The sound could have been enhanced a little bit, don't you think?<br />I think for the price they charged for this set, they could have really gone the extra mile and made it all a bit better.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this game is great it is not to hard or easy it gives you a lot of coins and is very addictive
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this version of Mahjong, as I love playing the version that comes with the Windows computers. This game up to the point I have played has not been quite as challenging as that one,but it's fun anyway. I like the different shaped puzzles. They don't seem to represent any difficulty in any way,just sort of creative to look at some of them. I would like more of a &quot; thinking game&quot; though.
0670023329|5.0|A hard book to read at times---man's inhumanity to man.  Interesting how difficult it was for him to adjust when he finally escaped from North Korea.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took me a while to get into it, but about half-way through, it got really interesting.  I did think the ending was lackluster and unsatisfying.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|This app has many faults, streams fail to load constantly. You can not log in and find followed streamers. So you have to search through games, which don't even load every game. So you will not be able to watch what you are looking for even though you know that ppl are streaming dais game. No chat function either. Don't bother unless you are using to watch top 3 esport games atm.<br /><br />Edit review;<br />Since said review it has been updated many times. Everything I complained about has been fixed. However, now  a new fault has come into play. With the introduction of ads, it sometimes freezes the app. In order to fix this you have to sometimes restart the kindle, because it just becomes a loop of crashing.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I love Rick Riordan's books.  My favorite is Percy Jackson, however I find his Kane Chronicles fun to read.  Especially since I don't know anything about Egyptian Mythology.
B007N8RULO|5.0|enjoying playing on the kindle because I can enjoy playing in any room or anywhere I can connect my kindle
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is addicting and its definetly worth getting I like the idea of the lottery and online if you have second thoughts about getting this game GET IT

B0067TQQI8|5.0|Ok, so...after being in NY,  hopping off of a subway and being in the middle of a place that didn't even come close to resembling a language I knew, it being 1:00 in the morning and waiting for a bus AND having 7% on my phone battery, I decided I was really really stupid to have not thought ahead. When I got back to my midwest town, I bought this bad boy. Let me tell you...it is worth its weight on GOLD. Ok gold is really expensive so I have to rethink that but I think you get the idea. It takes FOREVER to charge itself up (like... maybe 9 hours?) but when it is changed, you are good to go my friend. I had to sleep on the other side of my king size bed. Lazy, I know, but I didn't want to have to get an extension cord to keep things plugged into the top socket...ya da ya da ya da...all I took for charging my phone was this charger. I went for 5 nights charging my phone before I decided to recharge the external battery. It had not entirely used up 50% of its charging capabilities!!! I read lots of the reviews and even the really good ones, which most of them are, I still think they undersold it. I think it would easily recharge an iPad 4-6 times. Dunno but that's where I would put my money. It charges super fast as well. I think it would charge my iPhone from 0-100% in 45 minutes. Do it...you'll be glad ya did! I went to go and see wicked tonight...amazing...and my battery was almost dead. Forgot to plug it on the trip there. Shazam...I grabbed my charger. We rode on a broom off into the sunset.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|It is thrilling to see outer space photos and to watch the Star Trek stars in action. Of course I recommend this collection to all ages!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Although this book is our middle school's required reading, this is a great book for people of any ages.  It helps you self- reflect on your gifts, it allows you to have empathy for people's situations.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I highly recommend Life of Pi for an excellent evening at the movies in your own home. This movie is excellent entertainment for both kids and adults.
1451688091|5.0|Too bad today's politicians (all parties) are more concerned with politics than care of the public.  Perhaps if this book was required reading they'd learn the art of compromise and get something constructive done.  Right now I'd like to kick ALL the bumps out and make them get a real job.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book was good it told me about English it is not a bad idea to make sure that you learn how to speak English.

1451668945|5.0|This book was fun and a fast read Ms Clark did a great job at keeping you wondering and interested.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Received this as a mother's day gift and I cannot express how happy this makes me. The deluxe edition is packed with so many wonderful items and the attention to detail is phenomenal. Really well put together and a delight to go through all the books and listen to the remastered album. I am so skeptical of big box sets but this really delivers unbelievable content that is worth the extra cost. This was THE album of my childhood and I'm still loving the album and Wings (and of course Macca!) many years later.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is really a good movie, a very long movie, three hours!! I was hoping it would making reading the book easier but there are a lot of stories in this movie. All over, it is a very good movie.

B00BR476TG|5.0|Most previews are 2-3 minutes long. Sometimes those are the best parts of a movie. This is a beautifully long preview and certainly does justice to the movie. Enjoyed the preview so much we ordered the movie. Enjoyed that too!

1423140591|5.0|I would reccommend any of Rick Riordan's books to young readers looking for an educational and entertaining read. His mixture of ancient mythology and current times is brilliantly executed. I even found myself going back to some of the old myths to read them again from the source!

This as great of a read as the first book and is a wonderful sequel. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the final book in this trilogy. I also can't wait to see if the Capitol and President Snow get exactly what they deserve as well.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have to say this one is the best of his so far. Without giving it away he is telling the story through the eyes of more than one character. It is current and relevant.It is I think one for the NY Times best sellers list. This man is definitely one to follow for future releases! Enjoy it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I'm an old player from the original on PC, and when I saw this, I bought it instantly. It was a bit of a disappointment. They are making the same mistakes and glitches the original made (breaking a wooden slab with a pickaxe glitch, I'm looking at you). Nevertheless, the worlds feel empty. I know there's sheep, pigs, chicken, and cows, and of the evil mobs, they have creepers, spiders, skeletons, and zombies, but the world feels bland and empty. I know that it will take forever for the game to get to beta or a firm release date, but I wish they didn't have open alpha. Back to the review, there's not much to say about the graphics. They're 8-bit, so it's fine with me. The sound is great, nothing special, but the C418 soundtrack still hasn't been implemented. The gameplay is still the same: here's a sandbox, do whatever you want to do with it. Set it on fire, OK. Mine all of its minerals, OK. Kill hundreds of mobs, OK. Build a giant metropolis, OK. Creative mode is also there, and there hasn't been any change to it. Maybe I'm getting a bit too tired of Minecraft, due to its huge popularity, or maybe because one game, made in 2009, six years later, is bigger than it ever was on the beginning. Maybe someone that started in alpha might find the pocket edition nostalgic, but after seeing everything it's missing from the current version, it feels really small and empty. I know it's because of the capabilities of mobile devices, but still, try to push the hardware to its real limits, like Donkey Kong Country did with the Super Nintendo. Even after all of this, I still think it's a really fun game and since most of mobile games aren't very good, then an average game could be seen as a great game. I would recommend Minecraft to anybody. This earns Minecraft: Pocket Edition a 3.8/5.0
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this and nova made me learn to play a shooter on touchscreen. ty for whatever u call carpel tunnel from a pad. good fun.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Rarely do you ever find a simulation app on the app store, and even rarer, a good one. F18 Carrier Landing is the best one out there. There are different modes, like carrier/airbase landing and takeoff, free flight, in-flight refuel (Which I miserably failed to do), and rectangles, which is you going through rectangles in the sky with a time limit. There are four different aircraft:  McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Super Hornet ,Grumman F-14 Super Tomcat, Grumman C-2 Greyhound, and the Grumman A-6 Intruder. They're all different in speed and size, and are real fun to fly around and crash. The controls are actually quite simple. You have your throttle in the bottom left, you have the flaps in the middle right, the change view button, which allows to see in a chase-cam, cockpit, etc. you  have the brakes in the bottom right, and to the left of the brakes, you have your landing gear button. It's way easier than it seems. Landing a plane is also easy: turn on your landing gear, lower the throttle to around 20%, apply brakes, make sure to stay at a speed around 180. Now tilt downward slowly, and when the wheels are touching the ground, lower throttle to 0%, apply the brakes, and you're done. There are tutorials in-game, but if you're like me, you never looked at them. The graphics and sound are very well done, and the radio transmissions sound neat. There are four different maps to explore, which all look beautiful, even though up close, you can see that the bridge isn't actually placed in the ground, but floating a few feet above. For me, it's easily the best simulator in the app store. If you're looking for a great simulation game then look no further; F18 Carrier Landing is the game for you. I give F18 Carrier Landing a 5/5
B000QEILLK|5.0|\\"The Road Back Home\\" is a 2 CD compilation of Flower Kings material up through 2007.  This comp features the band's shorter and in some cases more commercial work.  This may or may not be a proper representation of the band's material depending on your perspective.  For a band that often releseses epics that exceed the 30 minute mark, focusing on shorter songs does not really give a newcomer a true perspective of what The Flower Kings are all about.  However, the songs that are here are almost all good and show a side to the band that sometimes gets buried underneath the weight of their more gargantuan epics.  The tracks on this album have been re-mastered and in many cases re-mixed with some having changes made to vocal and instrumental arrangements.  Some fans of the band may find this interesting while others, just looking for a straight forward compilation, may be disappointed.  Overall I think this is a really solid collection.  You get well over 2 hours of Flower Kings material that serves as a great introduction to new fans or an interesting new mix of classics for old ones.  The Flower Kings have never really had any hits, but arguably their two most popular songs \\"The Flower King\\" and \\"Stardust We Are\\" are represented here rounding out the set.  Rockers like \\"Paradox Hotel\\" fit in well next to more ethereal works like \\"Compassion\\".  The set also includes the bands cover of Genesis \\"Cinema Show\\" which was recorded for a tribute album, but never released on any Flower Kings discs.  The cover is great by the way.  Bottom line this is a really top notch compilation and I would think that both new fans and old would enjoy it.  No there are no 20 plus minute long epics on this one (you'll have to pick up the studio albums for those), but this is a great introduction to the more accessible side of the band.  Pairing this compilation with their earlier one \\"Scanning The Greenhouse\\" would really give fans a solid 3 CD collection of the best of the band up to 2007.There are only two overlapping tracks which makes them nice companion pieces to each other.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is very simple. You have to connect the different colored dots together on a grid (The grids are 5 by 5 to 12 by 12) without any pipe intersecting and you must fill up all the space there is on the grid. At first, it's a very easy and simple game, but when you get to the bigger grids, like 9x9 or 10x10, the challenge is absurdly difficult. The difficulty slowly goes up: the smaller the grid is, the easier the puzzle is. That's pretty much all there is to it. There are hundreds upon hundreds of puzzles for you to solve. Sometimes I felt like the developers were starting to get tired around the time they were making the bigger puzzles that sometimes, you'll have to use a pipe to cover up a small part of the grid. Also, there is no limit to how long you want the pipes to be, which makes it harder, because if they were limited, you would know which of your crazy ideas on how to solve the puzzle will certainly not work. There isn't much to the visuals and sound, but that's OK because it's the game that matters. I prefer Flow Free: Bridges over the original, Flow Free, but it's still a great puzzle game and one of the best apps in the Android Market. I give Flow Free a 4.8/5.0

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wonderful story, so nice to see how people lived in the early years.  Really enjoyed it and can't WAIT for Season 4.  Clean and not violent
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Helen Hunt deserved the academy award.  Terrific acting for a sensitive subject matter.  Made one realize the personal problems the handicapped goes through.  Loved the movie.
B004VFMCWE|5.0|I thought i was a great movie. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys real life everyday problems. It was also kind of funny to see Michael Douglas click out!!!
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|I honestly liked this movie - very intense as portrayed by  the performers.  But, very disappointed in the cinematography as the crucial final scenes was shot in the dark which in my opinion was too dark.  I know they were trying to make it realistic but there was simply too much dark scenes where you could hardly tell what was going on.  Bummers!  Hollywood can do better.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Brilliant. Outstanding. Superb. Colossal. Excellent. Monumental. Amazing. Breath taking. The Real Deal. Like fine wine, this album has aged very well. Thanks for everything Sir Paul; I wouldn't trade these precious memories for anything.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I read the book Life of Pi awhile ago and when I heard it was going to be made into a movie I read it again.  I love the story.  I saw the movie at the theater and knew it was one I wanted to own.  The story is touching, the cinematography fantastic.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I liked the movie and thought it was good.  This movie did a good job of telling a story and keeping my interest.  I would like it to explain a bit more at parts but I think it could stand on its own. I have also read the book prior to watching the movie. It took me a while to get through the book and it wasn't interesting enough for me to make me want to read the next book but I would watch this movies sequel if they ever make one.
193700788X|1.0|I have always been a loyal fan of the books because of the writing and characters...this book was so disappointing!  This was so unbelievable and contradictory to everything in the past books that I just can't wrap my head around it! How boring and lame!!! I felt like I was reading a pathetic knock off of my beloved Sookie character. I feel cheated that this is the ending the author saw fitting for such strong distinctive characters.
B009NY43NY|1.0|So it ended, and the end isn't what a lot of people wanted.  I get it.  I got it back when the first book came out.  I respect the author's choice for the heroine's HEA.  What I do not respect is the fact that Harris gave up even trying to measure up to the caliber of the pervious books' writing.  She gave up.  As a WRITER, this book was like the last, not worth the money.  If it was a $3 read yeah I get it because the plot was crap.  I got bored!  It was filler and obnoxious.  I won't get the time back that it took me to read the jumbled inconsistent assassination of characters I grew to like and care about.  I didn't care that true blood on hbo went in a different direction.  I appreciated the series for what Harris made it to be until books started reading like something half-assed and strained.  I had to strain to finish it.  And Harris, you don't suck because you made the book end the way it did, you suck because you gave up writing to the ending.  You quit on us.  You started something you didnt finish.  You will not get another penny out of me and I hope you are ashamed.  For an excellent review that said everything I am too mad to say read :  [...]    If I meet this blogger I will buy them a drink.  Hear hear!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is so so so FUN like one  of the best games in the world omg omg it is so fun!!!!!!!!
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is a time traveler  movie I can believe . Bill Murray treats the extraordinary events with his funny style of cynicism, desperation, and  hope. In graceful stride he is transformed . Kind of a &#34;Purgatory in Punxsutawney .&#34; The characters surrounding him are sincere and wonderful and the setting is perfect, even if it was filmed in Woodstock Illinois!
B0089XH38M|5.0|Works just as well as the free version for a laptop/desktop computer!! AVG is software I've trusted for quite a few<br />years, free or paid versions.
B00122DF16|4.0|I rated it a 4 because it at times feels cluttered with all that is going on, but overall it is good.  I do wish they would get with eminem and really change up both worlds, of rock and rap.. but Yes I would recamend this to a friend.
0307956350|5.0|An interesting story.  Convoluted.  It had a suprising ending.  The characters were well defined and seemed a reasonable parallel to reality.

B000001E8S|5.0|This is a masterpiece of Eno's way .... of many ! This album has rock-experimentations, new way, atmospheric sounds, plus all their songs are base on different movies!
141690977X|4.0|This book is a very funny and quick read.  While there are going to be very clear exceptions to the points made in this book, it offers a funny way to look at one of the standard issues in heterosexual dating relationships.  The book is written for women, but many of these scenarios are interchangeable by gender.  I spend a lot of time talking to male friends about their relationships and often the problem is that she's just not into THEM.  These people must be hilarious to work with - humor is quick and pointed.  I hold a PhD in Interpersonal Relationships - and while I wouldn't suggest this book as part of a prescription to understanding male/female relationships, it does shed a funny light on a common dynamic in dating (for ALL ages I might add....).
B0000009S3|5.0|This album is compose of jazz-rock,blues, rock n'roll all the good stuff! Give it a try and you will love it! :)
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|The actors were good as it gave them a chance to &#34;act&#34; but the story line was pitiful and very hard to follow
B007F5S1B8|4.0|However, the album has a good quality physically and song wise. This album has new wave, and little bit of country sounds. All songs are excellent , because has their own well-aspects in musically kind of thing. However, this album is good in way of matter but isn't their best ... I rather had the album of the whiteis-soldier cover
B00380URIO|2.0|This is a poor attempt to present  ones idea of what it would be like to live in space and of the foolishness of Cloning.
B001LV5OOY|4.0|This album has a musical aspect such as new wave -post punk, similar to the Joy-Division. The state of the album seems pretty well-good state. the tracks are decent but it seems that the musicians try their best to stay in feet on the ground. best songs, are bigger than us, unfinisged busines.... However, hopefully in their next new album (2013) will came more fuirous and stronger... because the last of this album was a little bit of the same.
B00CHILW64|5.0|A very well done film of a tragedy we hope we will never have to experience and of the importance of family to be? with during the hard times of life.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|I have Google drive which has the option built in to do what this does. I still downloaded to compare how the end result looked like. I did a few bills and the front cover of a book and they both look about the same. I don't see any added benefit of using this over drives version of this feature. However, if you don't have Google drive then this is a good product.
0738727326|4.0|Beautiful artwork, inspiring themes, & overall wonderful tarot deck. Great for readers & collectors alike.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The production is great.  I read the book and the movie is pretty close to the book.  I would watch it again.
B00009RDGA|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times and I never tire of it. I love the beautiful black and white and the locations.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Not impressed with the making -- too long and draggy.  It also can be quite slow at times. Overall, an average movie.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|I bought this for a friend and he's a forever Beatles fan. The album also brings back memories of my teen days in San Francisco and the summer of love. :^)
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Love this little sweeper!  Had one before.  Lightweight, gets at hard-to-reach places because of the swivel action.  Great for someone with mild disabilities like me.

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Big fan of the Eagles since 1976 and totally enjoyed the DVDs... Would recommend to anyone who enjoys music of the '70s and '80s.
B007EECSFA|4.0|A little slow getting started for me, but then I had a hard time putting it down.  One surprise after another made it a delightful read.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|So if we are stuck getting this movie as part of the bargain, might  I suggest to you all to do what I do. Pick a great sound track or music of some type and watch the video of the movie and listen to background or replacement music of your own choosing. It can make it a lot of fun. One example is &#34;The Wizard Of Oz&#34; with Pink Floyd's, &#34;Dark Side O The Moon&#34; as it's soundtrack. OZ is a 10 Star movie, but some people have seen it many times and are just trying something different. Well that's my 2 Cents, cya.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Loved all the characters.  I found them believable and very funny at times.  Be prepared once you start this book you will not be able to put it down. From the first chapter until the end it held my interest.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The book was grate it is sad in some parts but had love and happyness in it that is the grate thing about the book.

B000MKD9P6|5.0|This is a great movie. Fabulous acting from Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. If you are interested in fashion at all this movie is a must have and you will love the insight that it provides into the fashion industry.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|A very good game. Lots of fun! Wish it were longer. Bring on number 2! I am ready! Thank you both
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie is brillant. Johnny Depp as always never disappoints and this movie transports the viewer into J. M. Barie's life. It is a remarkable story that is truly heartwarming. A great movie to own for any Johnny Depp fan.
B00932A4XE|5.0|this movie was so good i laughed and almost cried. I highly recommend this movie if you like comedy movies
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|It's funny how when this band called themselves Thin Lizzy everyone threw a fit. But now that they changed their name, the Thin Lizzy comparisons keep coming in. Fantastic band either way. Phil Lynott would be proud. Recommened buy.
B00133MKVK|5.0|this is a great album, the orchestra arrangements are fantastic and really make each song so great.  I love S. Bassey and this one is a winner,
0345451325|4.0|Interesting subject matter. Good book for those who have previous played the halo games. Book was in good readable condition. Did have some water marks.
B000BJS4TO|3.0|I love John Williams, I believe there isn't anything he can do wrong.  This album however is just a little disappointing.  I do love some of the songs, but the rest of the album is kind of boring.
B00846REIS|5.0|Fantastic read .couldn't put it Down..Great book I can't wait to read the next one!  Sylvia day Is a fantastic writer!
B000022TSW|5.0|There's nothing I can really say that hasn't already been expressed within the reviews already published (the oldest one here seems to be nearly fifteen years old), but I still want to open up and say how much I LOVE this film. The musical score is fantastic (I find myself thinking about it at least once a week, if not sooner), the writing is great (especially in comparing it to the rest of the third season of South Park), and the characters are so vibrant and fleshed-out, I can always feel myself getting goosebumps whenever I re-watch it. I know how stupid and corny I must sound right now, but bear with me; I actually find it hard to believe not only did \\"Blame Canada\\" lost the awards to Phil Collins, but that Trey and Matt say they haven't seen the movie since it was released. This is a necessity if you are a South Park fan, and very watchable if not.
B0041TM5OU|1.0|Record was warped to the point that side  two is unplayable. Side one is fine, don't really get it. Bad pressing maybe
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|This album really demonstrates the power and simplicity of Fogerty's songs. Presented in largely new contexts, with guest artists from all corners of American popular music (Miranda Lambert and Tom Morrelo together at last?) the songs sound timeless- part of our collective history. The two new songs are his best in years and sound at home here with the back catalog. In an age where popular music has separated itself into increasingly compartmentalized categories, this record brings it all back together again and demonstrates how much these disparate styles have in common. The performances and production are outstanding without editing out the humanity and Fogerty's arrangements of his classics are interesting and fresh. This album reminded me just how much I love these songs.

B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie it was worth every penny. I will watch it again. I had some good laughs and loved all of the action.
B000787WVK|4.0|It says a lot for Boito, who was Verdi's librettist for \\"Otello\\" and \\"Falstaff,\\" that in \\"Mefistofele\\" he seems to be trying to write for the voice in a distinctive way, not merely aping Verdi, and certainly not heading Wagner-wards either.  The result isn't always successful -- some of the vocal lines don't lie very gracefully for the voice, and it takes artists of considerable stature and seriousness to squeeze the lyricism out of the sometimes spiky vocal writing.  To his credit, Pavarotti works hard at this, and so does Freni.  There is a drawback, though -- and I would be interested to hear if other reviewers had the same experience: the sound in the first three acts has the voices too closely recorded, so that at the more intense and loud moments, there is a tendency to some distortion, and even in the quieter moments Pavarotti and Freni don't quite sound like themselves -- i.e. as we have heard them on other recordings -- and even Ghiaurov suffers some distortion at the top of his range.  This problem, as I see it, with the sound, is the reason for my withholding a fifth star from what is, on the whole, a marvelous realization of this odd opera.  The problem disappears in Act 4 and the Epilogue: it's as if some Decca sound engineer made an adjustment -- and Montserrat Caballe (Helen of Troy) is much more kindly treated by the recording equipment than poor Mirella Freni was in the earlier acts -- and that's a pity, because Freni sings very well and is fully committed to the drama.  Had she been singing \\"L'Altra notte\\" in Caballe's acoustic, that would have been something.  Pavarotti sings with distinction throughout, but in the final act and the Epilogue, the sound finally does him justice, and I can't imagine the Epilogue, which includes \\"Guinto sul passo estremo,\\" being better done than it is here. It's as fine a piece of tenor singing as I've heard on record.<br /><br />Ghiaurov, with his lower voice, suffers less from the sound problems than Pavarotti and Freni -- and his voice is in fine condition.  He gives a marvelous reading of the part. The chorus -- very important in this opera -- has fine body and is well caught both up close and in the distance.  De Fabriitis conducts superbly in what might have been his last recording.  So . . . I say, go for it.  It's worth it for the last act and Epilogue alone!Freni -- and his voice is in fine condition.

B003WJ81MA|1.0|Just saw this psychedelic fairy-tale again and I'll go back to forgetting it. The characters have zero depth. The story is silly and almost non-existent. The visuals are cool at times, but so disjointed and cribbed from a hodge-podge of Maxfield  Parrish and a book on fairies that they lose any cohesiveness. Tim Curry camps it up in his vampy Devil role (and I'll admit he does look pretty badass), and Tom Cruise stumbles around looking clueless like he's pondering the director's advice through every scene. Mia Sara should go back to Ferris. While I was watching I got bored, started reading about the production on Wikipedia and realized that was basically a page of fan fiction. Tangerine Dream's soundtrack could be replaced over any alt-80's flick, and isn't very memorable although it fits the schizo tenor of the flick. I wouldn't let a small child see this, as it's a potential nightmare factory, and unless your teen/tween daughter resembles the girl in love with Bowie's crotch from Labyrinth I'm not sure what target audience would sit through this. And what sort of moral or lesson can be gleaned from screwing the horn back on a horse? Just a disappointing fairy tale all around.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|The movies are great, but the slip in pages scratch the discs to the point where they aren't watchable.  This practice has become a standard when putting out an entire series of movies or TV shows.
B008LSVLVA|5.0|I recently saw Steven Wilson on tour for his latest album (The Raven That  Refused to Sing) and was blown away. This presentation, with largely the same musicians, was filmed in support of the previous album (Grace for Drowning), although the great song Luminol from The Raven is performed here. Great surround sound and high def image. Captures the show quite well. With CDs, DVD, and Blu-Ray it is a steal at this price.

B009E3EXMU|5.0|One concert that John Bonham would be so proud of his son Jason playing for his father. Thank You Jason!
0142501123|5.0|Another great story from Julia Donaldson. Within a couple of readings he was joining in the story. He loves the witch toy I got to go with it
B008220D5K|4.0|Really had some a great laughs.  We are in our 70`s  + enjoyed this!!  Picked it up for our daughter + hubby who just turned 40.  So took a look at it + kept it .  Not too many funny movies out there.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|This movie was so disjointed, long and boring, I couldn't begin to be interested in the vast array of characters it presents.
1594744769|5.0|After reading this book, I was amazed to find that this is categorized as a young adult book. The writing is not condescending, the characters talk the way people talk, and not toned down or changed to conform to some kind of arbitrary standard of 'bad language'. It is told from the perspective of a teenager, and so if I have to think about it, the way his family is portrayed is definitely the kind of one sided perspective that a kid would have on his parents.<br /><br />This book is seeded with a variety of very interesting and slightly creepy vintage photographs, mostly of children doing weird things. The story is written around, and very inspired by, these photographs. What's more, the author turns the creep factor into familiarity, so that I was eager to see the next photo and understand the explanation. The writing keeps you guessing, and wondering, and I was quite unable to put it down.. putting a huge strain on the laundry bin! the kind of<br /><br />If my son was of an age to read such a thing, I would not hesitate to give him this book to read, either. It's adventurous and scary, and the kind of 'kid empowerment' book that would appeal, I think.<br /><br />Don't give this a pass, it is worth the money, and worth the time.

B000SEFNMS|3.0|\\"Into the Wild\\" is an account of the life and death of Chris McCandless, set in the early 1990s, and written by Jon Krakauer. I was vaguely aware of this book prior to spotting it at a library sale, and I decided to pick it up when I saw on the cover that it had been a national bestseller. The author used personal interviews from Chris' friends and family, as well as Chris' journal and other items he left behind, to piece together a two-year period of Chris' life just after graduating from college. In a nutshell, McCandless traveled throughout North America, ending up in a remote area of Alaska where he lived out a \\"grand experiment,\\" his chance to live completely independently of others and solely off the land. He successfully did this for several months, until a few minor mistakes cost him  his life.<br /><br />While I admit that the book was somewhat interesting, and definitely well-written, I couldn't help wondering as I was reading why this had been a bestseller. To be blunt, I had a very difficult time connecting with Chris. I have a strong feeling that had I known him, our personalities would have clashed. McCandless seemed to be a \\"know it all\\" with a good bit of hubris and poor view of his parents mixed in for good measure. While some may describe him as a \\"free spirit,\\" I would describe him as a young man who had a lot to learn about life. To be fair, I think he did learn some good lessons as he lay dying in an abandoned bus in Alaska--but by then, unfortunately, it was too late.<br /><br />As I mentioned, Krakauer did a good job writing the story, and he even mixes in some of his own life story, which I felt was appropriate and, in fact, a great deal more enriching to read than the rest of the book! This fact alone brings up my estimation of Into the Wild. The factual story by itself I felt was sub-par; Krakauer's writing was above average. Thus, I would rate this as an average book overall.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|It was so fun but I opened it once and there was no picture or sound anymore!!!!!!!!! FINE. I'll just play it on the computer :D No but really I was glued to this app until that happened. And I was about to buy tokens!!!!!
0792840461|5.0|I saw this movie when it was first released and it instantly became one of my top ten favorites. Although time has added a different perspective, I still find this movie to be interesting, intriguing and a great example of a romance/mystery of that era. This is certainly one of the movies that caused fans to label Steve McQueen \\"Mr. Cool\\". The fact that a \\"copy cat\\" film of the same name was subsequently made should suggest just how timeless and entertaining this movie is. I watch it at least once a year and never tire of it.
B000A1SZ2Y|3.0|The performance of this Snap-On Lens is dependent upon the lens focal length. When placed on a 70mm - 300mm lens, the Snap-On Lens performed well throughout the focal length. However, when I placed it on an 18mm - 200mm lens, there was significant vignetting even at 200mm. Vignetting would be expected at the wide angle of 18mm, but not at a focal length of 200mm.<br /><br />Due to this vignetting, I returned the Snap-On Lens for a refund.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I have listened to the Moody Blues since the 60s and have been going to their shows for the last five years.  Justine is  their frontman and has the greatest voice.  This album is terrific, some Moody Blues sounds, some a little country.  I didn't have any CDs of his as a solo artist but after I purchased this one I bought two more solo CDs.  I would recommend it highly.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|But what I needed to know if I was going to like the show or not, once I have read a book it's hard to resolve that with a movie or show especially the characters.  It was good though and now I might just buy the seasons that are out or rent them on my Kindle.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I love Joe Walsh and remember his songs from the James Gang days.  I highly recommend this cd.  One Day at a Time is my very favorite.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The title says it all. It's a great price for a mouse of this quality. My only complaint is the weight system. It is easily understood just slightly annoying to use but I won't dock a star for that!
1250006341|5.0|Glad to add this to my collection of favorite stories.  Will be ordering the other seasons before long so I will have all of them.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|i LOVE LISTENING TO bLAKE'S MUSIC AND THIS IS AN AWESOME CD THAT I HAVE LISTENED TO OVER AND OVER :)
0345535421|4.0|Fine as ever, but have to deduct a star for the smallness of the pages, and in particular for the illegible maps. Do think of your older readers when it comes to print size...
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I'm not a big book reader but am loving this book and don't want to put it down!!! I wish I could read more books like this
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series and I watched this on Amazon with my prime member account....it was wonderful.  I could not find it on Netflix.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|No matter what your taste in music, you can never go wrong with this collection of classics.<br /><br />Top shelf for any audiophile.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this series...hooked!!!  I like how easy it is to catch up on anything that I missed on tv.
B0022F1XW0|4.0|A great compilation, purchased to augment my vinyl collection of the original releases.<br /><br />Sadly, these are the 'single' versions, and songs like TONIGHT TONIGHT are abridged.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|The Clifton Chronicles is an absorbing series and Archer's latest installment keeps pace.  The only hardship related to reading these stories is waiting for the next publication cycle!
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|The plot line of this movie moves back and forth between the present day and the courtship etc. of Wallace and Edward (W.E.) I loved the clothes both present and past-tense.  Kind of a chick flick, especially if that period of history interests you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've always wanted this app ever since my bff got it last year. It is saved but I cant buy it yet.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Nice easy listening for driving in my car.  The best song is the duet with Reece Witherspoon.  The other songs are nice, but not too exciting.
B002ZG974M|3.0|Nice movie, precious babies!  Love the concept and the scenery.  I did feel it got a little boring in parts. Which is a minor complaint since the babies are absolutely fun to watch.
B005FISC52|5.0|One Tree Hill is NUMBER ONE in my heart! I love this show and I am totally hooked! It's such a great and fun show to watch and really grabs you at times! Definitely recommended!
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Unlike some of the older games in this fashion, this game is pretty easy.  Controlling your ship via touch screen is actually easier in my opinion than using a controller or an arcade setup.<br /><br />Still, it reminds me a bit of the old Space Invaders, Asteroids, Galaga, Yarrs Revenge games from back in the day, but with flashy effects and graphics.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|i love this game.  highly addictive game.  i hope more come out.  i would definately purchase more.  great for all ages
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I finished the game in 2 1/2 hours.  The end credits list how long you played and other stats, that is how I know.  But for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours it's fun.<br /><br />Basically this is Tetris Attack, Might and Magic Heroes, and Puzzle Fighter all in one.  You use your finger to move the columns or rows and line up at least 3 of any like icons.  This enables your hero (on the top portion) to perform an action.  He can attack, use magic, gain shields from defense, unlock doors or chests, or collect stone or lumber.  As you get farther you gain access to harder 'runs'.  When you fall off the screen to the left your run ends.  You lose speed when attacked and also when you spend time trying to unlock doors and such.  Quick reflexes are needed to get the most out of each run.<br /><br />You use acquired experience, gold, stone and lumber to improve your stats including attack, defense, and magic.<br /><br />It's a ton of fun, very addictive.  But when I finished it I had little desire to go back and play again.  So hum.  But it's a fun game free of bugs.  I never had it crash once.  Played on a Samsung Galaxy S3.
0143034901|5.0|I had to work a bit harder on this book, but it was well worth it.  All the characters' names are Spanish, and it took some effort to keep them straight at first. (Names of towns and venues in Spanish with the same initial struggle). Eventually I got familiar with it and it was a joy.<br /><br />A great mystery, memorable characters and an intriguing plot and subplots.  CRZ can be a bit repetitive on describing a scene as it relates to weather or lighting, but don't let that stop you.  I think CRZ is an amazingly talented story teller and I've read just about all his other translated works.  Can't wait for the new one to come out in June.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't know what to say except...it was excellent. I found myself so excited to see what came next, I started skipping paragraphs!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I would compare this to Dowton Abbey but with more humor. This family did more than eat at the table all the time.  I like learning about history through these movies.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Confusing, but if you have almost 2 & 1/2 hrs to waste - go for it. You may find it interesting
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|I liked the movie!  I had read the book a while ago.  I love both actors, they are both so great!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game! Fun and not too easy or too hard! Great game to keep you entertained and pass time but it does not frustrate you! Excited for more games !
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very great book, it has lots of cliff hangers and intense moments. Even if you have not read the hunger games you will fully understand this book. The thing that I didn't like about this book is the build-up of time before she got to the games, even though there were some very interesting moments before the games.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was very suspenseful. It is well written. I could not put it down..  I do hope there is more to come.
B008G3N71W|3.0|As I read this book I had A difficult time keeping the train of thought.  it had really hot sex scenes like her in a bathroom stall servicing 5 guys. BUT OVERALL I didn't enjoy it . It didn't have a flowing story.
B00APPJELG|5.0|So I started watching this series because of all the hype I kept hearing...I am so happy I did!! I am so in love with all the characters and love this whole series!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this for my bf for Christmas2012 and he loved it, he was so excited that we spent the next week watching all 8films over and over :)<br /><br />The quality and condition was perfect, the picture quality is fantastic even when the early years weren't full screen and the sound is amazing on our surround sound system!
B009EEMMWW|3.0|This is definitely not the best of Penelope Cruz's movies... and not one for those looking for much Spanish practice
B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoyed the read... was a little disappointed in wrap up ending the series.  I did not get a lot of closure.  I look forward to reading After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse
B0026QC0YU|5.0|This is a great movie. I liked the whole series. Tom Cruise does a great job of capturing the audience!
B005JS7VTQ|5.0|Haven't heard these Albums completely in a very long time. They are just as good or even better than I remembered them. Not sure if these are remastered, but the sound quality is awesome. Great value
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|not as good as 1 & 3, (or 4), but still a nice performance by Tom Cruise - and great opening scene!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Much better to use the Kindle browser for FB...app is not a goody. Needs much improvement. No interested....back to the drawing board.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I had heard there would be some great special effects, but I was really surprised how good the movie was.
B00942X8PY|1.0|You can only go so far in this game before you reach the end and have to upgrade, so I deleted it.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|It was a great film and brought back many memories of the time period and what we were going through when the hostage situation took place.
B0089XH38M|3.0|I like AVG, and even have it on my PC's, but the kindle version will not always update and it takes a little playing with, so that is kind of bothersome.
B001974DG0|5.0|gripping page turner .  one of the best I have ever read. Very emotional in parts.  Best of Dean Koontz and he says so.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this at the movie theater and thought the performances were outstanding.  I will love watching this classic from time to time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|describes an evil person to a &#34;T&#34;.  We visit Oak Island NC every summer and know firsthand the places in the book.  Eat at the same restaurant (Different name) in Southport.  Advice: Visit Oak Island and bring this book.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Love this DVD!  I watched this on PBS and just had to have it/ I rarely purchase any DVDs.and it is fantastic.
0670024813|3.0|Some long-winded chapters and some that are absolutely fascinating. I loved the ones about treatment of elderly and &#34;constructive paranoia&#34;.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|AS with the very first novel of Nicholas Sparks I read I continue to be in love with his way of grabbing you by the heart and keeping you spellbound until the last page.  This is my second favorite book I have read of his--and I have read them all.  Keep them coming Nicholas
B007EC27QM|5.0|Absolute best simple calculator ever. Clean and crisp, super intuitive. Whooda thought a simple calculator could be improved upon? Good job!
B005XLN97M|3.0|It's okay. It's pretty simple to put together. The &#34;extras&#34; are cute. But, my daughter never plays with it. There's just not a lot of space for Barbie to move around. It's just okay.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I considered giving this show 4 stars because I think it can only improve from where it started from.  However I decided on 5 because the risks they took really proved this freshman series as one of the best on TV.  Instead of giving you all of the information in five episodes or so, important plot elements and character developments are revealed bit by bit throughout the season. We are even left looking forward to Season 2 because there's still a lot we do not know.
B00A1XIXM8|3.0|monotonous music and rhythm, as if it were a title track to last the whole album. boring. Although all of the traditions of the genre are met. in the texts present a reasonable, philosophical grain. for background sound-fit.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|Gripping and powerful. I am so curious to know what happens next. Well written. I enjoyed the writing style and layout of the story. Worth reading.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson came into my life unbidden with his completion of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. At first, his narrative style was quite off-putting - the differences between his and Robert Jordan's style were just enough to be distracting. But, unable to leave a story unfinished, I plowed through the rest of WoT. Either Sanderson found a workable flow, or, more likely, I got used to the workable flow he had; I'd been weaned off Robert Jordan.<br />I've heard great things about Sanderson, so I decided to give him a try on his own work. I started with the Mistborn series. While by no means the epitome of great storytelling, there was enough juiciness to the series to keep me interested. Even as I doubted that Sanderson would become one of my go-to authors for escapist fantasy, I finished the series before I realized I had been enthralled. Moving on to this, The Way of Kings, dispelled me of any nagging doubts. The writing is significantly better, the story flows at beautifully, the characters are intriguing (mostly), and the sheer girth of the book leaves me shivering with glee (not literally). I love books that I can immerse myself into, and this one delivers. I only regret the inevitable wait for sequels - I fear I may have gotten into another WoT/Game of Thrones fiasco.<br />Oh, well. Perhaps anticipation will make the ride that much sweeter.
B003YDUUHI|5.0|Take the top songs over the years done by Robbie Williams and put them in a collection --- INGENIUS!! I know that this belongs in every fans collection!
0446554995|5.0|I have followed Agent Pendergast from the beginning and he has a hold on me just waiting for the next book. Superior writing and Two Graves is excellent as usual by this dynamic duo of authors.
B003U0AHCI|5.0|Taking the history from the reunion with Gary to being in Take That - all the best of the best videos are up for viewing by the music master - Robbie Williams.
B004XISI4A|3.0|The book follows on nicely from the fourth and it's good to be reacquainted with the characters, but you're left with the sense that the author just didn't know what to do with them, so he 'parked' them in locations for a while, until he found some more inspiration and a direction the plot could follow.<br />I have to admit, my interest in this series is waning. The characters are forced into less and less plausible situations, and when they make choices based on the limited number of outcomes available to them, they are killed off.<br />Having said all that, most of the major characters have made it through and I guess we will all be buying the sixth book, but I don't think it will be very good.
B0093LFGMO|5.0|I don't understand how Mr. Williams isn't more popular in the States - I have loved him since his teen years. I love Candy, but I think Different really showcases his ability to sing and WOW you.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Easy to watch all episodes didn't take very long to download to computer. Quality on each episode was great. Recommended
B00005RFVL|5.0|Big Band classic songs redone wonderfully and brilliantly by Robbie Williams with special guests, not limited to Jon Lovitz to Frank Sinatra.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|These are some of my favorite adventure movies. The case is very cool-looking as well and the picture and sound quality is awesome!
B006GWO5NE|2.0|I plugged it into my kindle and nothing I have to move the usb part around move the cord around and still no direct charge. If I let it sit I've noticed that after a day in a half it would be charged. This is based on me having the cord in just the right position.
B00BLCHZC2|3.0|It seemed a  little...detached.  I don't know, just didn't seem to have great acting. imo.  It had pretty cool action though.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is a fast filler game, everyone I've played this with enjoys it. The theme and game mechanics work very well together (courtly intrigue to get close to the princess), it is physically small and well made. It involves a good amount of player interaction. At less than $10, you'd be crazy not to add this to your collection. Would make a great gift, even for someone who is not a big gamer.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|It is hilarious!  My grandkids and nieces love it! Very entertaining!<br />I would recommend this app to anyone with small or not so small kids!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like this game but the in app purchases are expensive like buying the diamonds for suits who wants to pay 100 dollars for all the suits I think it's expensive to pay ten bucks and that's not enough if you want a suit that sucks. They don't let you take your diamonds back if you click on the wrong suit that you didn't want.It is fun and game play is great and has nice graphics but can be a tad bit laggy. Over all it good.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great for keeping an eye out on the weather!  Alabama has some fast changing, potentially severe weather a and I use this app very often!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|love the drawing pad. Its great fun, very entertaining for children even for adults. The colors are great and the background paper is awesome. I highly recommend this.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Love playing iron man, keeps me entertained while recouping from heart surgery. Armor is a little spendy but it keeps me playing . It was really great getting the game for free.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I give this game 5 stars. It gives kids and adults a well put challenge. Although as you continue the games becomes harder. So buy it, love it, Don't live it and remember for the time being it's free.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its so amazing get it and take care of your animals!Don't forget get on every day.I love it and you will to!

B005HQ5S3G|4.0|It has in all honesty been a rocky road for American Idol to produce talent with career longevity. Kelly Clarkson is one of a hand full of winners from the show that has enjoyed a sustaining career. The album 'Stronger' displays that talent and great vocal range that Clarkson embodies as an artist. Her talent has surpassed the lifespan of the show itself, making her a bonafied and established entertainer. The only other artist from that particular talent show to enjoy such a career is Carrie Underwood. Clarkson deserves credit as a pioneer who left the show a winner and continued to build a reputation as a singer. Fans and newcomers to her music should give the album 'Stronger' a listen because it definitely does not disappoint but showcases the talent of Kelly Clarkson. True talent is hard to find in the current music industry, but there are the few that stand out in this industry. Kelly Clarkson is one of those standout artists.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|this was an action packed movie with a good story also.  bought it for my son but even the girls liked it.

B00APUYWYA|3.0|This film started out a bit slow but we actually thought it was quite good halfway through. And I really enjoyed their music. Worth seeing
B00005JKDR|5.0|New animations come up that are fresh and clever and heart-touching, strong in plot, fresh in ideas and technically clever. This is one such new classic with &#34;legs&#34; destined to carry it through many many years.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Has something for everyone. Never have gone through so many books so fast. If you breath air, you'll enjoy these books.

1616550414|5.0|If you are a zelda fan, this is a must have book. The quality of the book is extremely high and you can see the effort that was placed into creating it. This will probably become a fortune in the future to those who keep this in mint condition and wish to resell it.
B0097A2LTW|5.0|One of my davorite movies ever!  The special effects are spectacular.  The music of the movie is incredible.  I love this movie reminiscent of simpler more innocent times.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little sharpener to keep in your glove box or tackle box. I was a professional cook for thirty years until I retired. I used stone and steel until I could afford diamond sharpeners. I haven't been a big fan of these guided sharpeners, but this little guy has changed my mind. I bought it for my teen-aged son as a simple way for him to sharpen his own knives and quit bugging me to do it for him. After showing him how to use it with one of my pocket knives, I was really impressed with the edge that I got and how rapidly it sharpened. It doesn't work very well on larger knives, but then it isn't intended to. If you need a great little sharpener at a very affordable price, this is it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I have never done a building game before and this one really keeps your interest- very addicting and fun!<br />One thing I wish it would have is interchangeable money- coins to be changed into dollars.  I think some of the decorations<br />are overpriced.  The most annoying thing is when your dinosaurs are evolving it takes a very long time to get them out- lots of money as well.  It's almost like going to the casino -you never know if all three will pop up at the same time! Also I don't think you should have to go to market to buy your dinosaur after spending all of the money in the lab.<br />I really like the way everything progresses in real time- it teaches one patience.<br />It keeps you coming back for more every day!
037582913X|1.0|I had this book when I was a child and wanted to buy it for my daughter. While definitely disgustingly overpriced for a standard children's book, it is everything I remember. The drawings are cute and my daughter just loves it. She cannot read yet but has it almost memorized. It's a funny book and Grover is so lovable and furry. I give it one star because I paid eight dollars and ninety nine cents for something that should be a buck or two.
B004BSFC46|5.0|i brought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she<br />loves them , they stay on her wrist and she shakes her<br />hands all around.

B00C4YZ12C|4.0|is a very addictive game and time just breeze by (excellent while waiting at Doctor's appt.) the only thing that I don't like is that you have to star all over if you close the game. there is no &#34;save&#34; feature, too bad. But other than that is excellent

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was absolutely amazing! The whole time I was reading it I was biting my lip waiting to see what would happen next. The anticipation builds and right when you think you know what's going happen, the story takes an unexpected turn. I loved it!
B003K1EYM6|3.0|This unit is for an IPAD1 or 2 .  It will not work with IPAD3 or higher due to the mini plug used on the later ones.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|A novel I've always told myself I'd read, I picked up The Spy Who Came In From The Cold by John le Carre after being disappointed by a recently written spy story set in the past.<br /><br />Written during the height of the Cold War by a man who was in fact a British agent stationed in divided Germany, there is no questioning the authenticity of Spy. The language, the characters, and atmosphere -- you are there, standing just meters from the newly-erected Berlin Wall, waiting nervously for your agent to attempt the crossing. This is exactly what I was craving in that other novel, and why I finally turned to le Carre's breakthrough book.<br /><br />I don't usually write much in the way of reviews for traditionally published books; there are others, far more accomplished than I who have already trod that ground. Potential readers have a wealth of views to sift through, but I highly recommend this taut, twisty story from a master storyteller.
B00991TCOG|4.0|Lindsey is an amazing artist. Love the cd and would recommend it to anyone that loves upbeat violin music. Enjoy listening to her while doing other tasks.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus (Wool 1-5), by Hugh Howey, is a tremendous science fiction novel about life in a post-apocalyptic world with an extremely toxic environment. The surface of the planet is totally unlivable, and the populous lives in a huge underground \\"silo,\\" which houses thousands of people. I found the physical and social environment of the silo community to be fascinating. The structure begins at ground level and submerges about 100+ levels into the ground. People live their entire lives within the silo and never go outside. Life depends upon a highly technological society and is controlled by a highly developed IT compound situated in the mid-levels and a ruthless mayor who lives in the \\"up top\\" floors. All needed commodities, products, crops and other materials/items are produced within the silo. Different products and services are situated on specific levels and delivered where needed. The mechanical department, which handles life-support for the entire habitat, is located on the bottom levels (the \\"down deep\\"). The stairs are the only way to move from one level to another. Life in the silo includes rigid rules that must be followed, and breaking those rules incurs severe punishment from villainous leaders. Even speaking about certain topics or dissatisfactions can mean death by expulsion from the silo. Aside from its interesting environment and society, this book has many complex, colorful, eclectic, and endearing characters that endure excruciating situations and demonstrate heroic actions for the reader to appreciate. However, the reader must also endure breathless trepidation while characters are struggling for survival and gut punches from the death of characters. Wool is a totally engrossing story, which captures the reader until the end. In addition, Mr. Howey's prose makes it an even greater pleasure to experience this story. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes science fiction, and especially post-apocalyptic science fiction. I thought it was great and I plan to read his future installments.
B001JI72AI|4.0|A little on  the long side, but I love movies about the Apollo space missions. I would recommend it to anyone who loves American history too.
B0081336FO|5.0|The writing, acting, production quality and viewer experience of this show is as good-if not better- than going to the movies. Great fun, a must-see
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|A very cute reversal of the expected.  Tucker and Dale were so sweet.  The chemistry between the two was outstanding
B009MYARIK|4.0|I love all her books! This was another fantastic read. Very enjoyable story & characters. Totally recommend as a beach read.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not Jon Snow. Martin kills all I care about. I honk I skipped every other word to try to see what was going to happen!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Not much more to say. It is good quality item and it works just fine. Arrived before the est. delivery date.<br />Driver was supplied and installed on XP Pro with no problems at all.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|When I first decided to get this movie I thought it was going to be VERY different than what it actually was. I liked the storyline of the movie, but I thought it moved a bit too fast. There were many parts where I wished they gave more detail. Like into the character. Each characters back story was either non- existent, or extremely short. If they gave more detail I would have given it 5 stars. Overall it was a pretty good movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|how do you update to Miami version using kindle? please help me discover the steps on how to update on my kindle fire :))

1476733422|4.0|The Great Gatsby is one of my all time favorites. Here's a tale that shows Fitzgerald's versatility. One to curl up with and spend an enjoyable moment going back to an era of opulence. Like an old movie, I relished in the past. Good writing as usual.
0142418471|5.0|Two different authors, two different Will Graysons.  The perspective is quite amazing and I would recommend to any teenaged person looking for a good read with a strong message.  The book was very captivating the whole way through.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing, I couldn't put it down, sometimes I read so late that dawn would be arriving when I went to bed. It's that awsome.;)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very cute simple game. Downloaded it on my kindle fire to pass some waiting  time. It says it's for kids but I am enjoying it plenty myself. I can see where a kid would enjoy it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. I cannot wait to finish so I can start building all over again. Would recommend to everyone. Even my grandaughter loves to play  it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So many unexpected twists, I couldn't put it down! It kept me up late every evening, and exclaiming out loud!
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I ordered this for my son's birthday party recently. It was supposed to arrive two days ago and it still has not found it's way to my house. There has been no update as to where it is and the party is tomorrow. So if you want to give this as a gift you would be better off buying it at the store. This is very disappointing because the movie was going to be a great gift.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I love the Eagles. So anything they do or say is great to me. Found out alot I didn't know.
1451697686|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book as I had read reviews on it.  It turns out to be much \\"ado about nothing!\\".  It has some very useful tips for those new to the eco world, but for those who have been around for awhile not that much new (except peeing on your citrus plants and compost pile is a new one to me!). Many of the tips just aren't very practical so what's the point if you can' t implement them?  My biggest complaint is her \\"advice\\" in the children's section. I support adoption 100%. I also believe the future of this nation and any other nation is in our youth.  What a shame that this author almost apologizes for having her two boys. She talks of children as something we have to be protected from.  This author has obviously bought into the whole planned parenthood agenda to rid the world of \\"undesirables\\"(isn't that the same thing they said in Germany?).  It is the trash we need to get rid of,not having children.  Who knows one of these children just might figure out what to do with all this trash!  \\"To say that there is too many children, is to say there are too many flowers.\\" Blessed Mother Teresa
B005LAIIHG|5.0|What an adventure!  This movie does not end after it's over.  It's one of those that stays with you and makes you think.  Woke up next day still thinking about it. Touches you deeply, or at least that is how it affected me. If you haven't seen it I would recommend that you did.  Pretty awesome.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love Jeff Kinney's diary of a wimpy kid books they are so funny!! I think everyone should give it five stars.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|We had out of town company visiting when this movie arrived and my son was eager to see it. We ended up watching it together....people ranging from 8 years old to 69 years young!  Everyone laughed out loud, no one was put off my crude language or bad behaving.  Was a great entertainment!  Would highly recommend.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Samurai vs zombies defense 2 is AWESOME!!!you have to get it!! My son loves it!! He kept asking me to get it it got so annoying I finally got it it is so cool I even play it when he is asleep!!

B00846REIS|5.0|It was nice to see a problem that most relationships have come to life, and to have a different perspective!
B000001EYO|5.0|Having said that, it falls short on the full list of tracks. I followed up this purchase by tracking down all the missing songs to make a complete set - pity the complete set isn't available to buy all together.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I bought this book because I had previously bought (and reviewed) &#34;Fame&#34; for my kindle.  Fame is set around two actors who are going to be rereleasing Wuthering Heights, and all kinds of issues (among other things) that doing Wuthering Heights brought up.  It piqued my interest, so I bought the book. Wuthering Heights is a bit difficult to follow because some of it is written in flashbacks, and I had a hard time following the cast of characters and their relationships to each other.  But not to worry -- there is alot on the internet that is helpful -- sort of &#34;Cliffs Notes&#34; if you will. So I printed myself a &#34;cheat sheet&#34; and I had no further problems!  Enjoy!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|It gives me warm fuzzies. I watched every time I could as a kid but never saw them all. Classic sci if.
B00005K3NR|5.0|You know this is a classic movie.  One that can be watched again and again.  A must for any movie collection
B007FG9LIE|5.0|It was one of many free books I ordered when I bought my I pad. The title got my attention but I never thought it would take me on the ride that it did. Very well written and happy to know it is from a fellow Coloradan. Look forward to reading more of your work. I to was a Twin Peaks fan as a teenager.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I can't believe she would end an amazing series like this!!!! She owes her fans a rewrite!!! What a piece of crap! That's all the time I'm going to spend complaining about it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I am SO super glad I purchased this book!  At the beginning I wasn't expecting much, but I quickly loved every word I read!  I thought the characters were great and Drew's POV was hilarious.  I was laughing out loud hard throughout the book.  I especially loved how Drew and Kate \\"battled\\" with each other in the beginning and his relationship with his niece Mackenzie.  This was the perfect thing to tide me over until the next Crossfire novel comes out in a few days and I CANNOT wait for the next book Twisted!  Seriously, Emma, well done you!
159463176X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. As soon as I finished it, I started it over. It's even better the second time because you know the characters, the places, what is going to happen.  You know what to pay attention to.<br /><br />I think this book is different in terms of style than Hosseini's first two books.  I would not compare them. But all three have a powerful message. I liked this book the best of the three!!
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|WE were so happy that you had this fifth season available, because we followed all of the seasons, and then THUD, netflix didnt carry the fifth season.  I told my hubby &#34; wait, ill try amazon!!&#34;  and THERE YOU WERE!!!  so we are very happy with our purchase, and happy that you sent it SO FAST too.  Thank you!! :)  We miss merlin and wish it could be around forever, but we are still thankful that we were able to see the final season because of you:)  Thank you so much for such fast service!  we give you a double A++++++++  Thank you!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|When I find a good book I want it to keep going...I was so delighted that this series continued past the first season.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This app allows me to know when the new moon is here which signals the begining of a new month according to the bible.  The moon is set in space  and it is very clear to view.  the app tells you what phases it is in.  I find it very cool for the purposes for a biblical calendar.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great colorful game that keeps me challenged with many different levels. You will enjoy this game. Fun to try to beat your own records.
B00821OX98|5.0|I really wanted to watch it during normal programming but was too busy. Love that I can watch it online. Can't wait for season 3.

B009NY43NY|4.0|Sadly this is the last Sookie book, but it ties up the loose ends nicely.  I will miss this series!
B005K17RU0|2.0|app is now cumbersome, slow and not User friendly since upgrade. will stop using app! Please give us back the last version.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just as great as similar games, not as many cubes to match but overall interesting and addictive. It gives me many hours of enjoyment.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Not a difficult game, interesting back story.  Good graphics.  The challenges could have been more difficult.  There were few puzzles which would improved the game.  Looking forward to next one
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Very happy with this purchase ... Trying to replace all my old VHS movies with DVDs. Nice is this is a complete set of the movies.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It is so nice to be surprised by a beautiful ending that you did not expect.  Nicholas Sparks is a favorite author of so many, including me.  This movie was riveting from the very first scene to the last.
0425263916|5.0|So this is a continuation of Eva and Gideon and their infatuation with each other. They are a couple now with more love for each other and more sex and lust than ever. I wrote a review on the 1st book mentioning the limo sex scene was the best one and now in this second book, once again, sex in the limo with Gideon and this time, Eva gets sort of a punishment. don't get me wrong. eva did not get beaten up. in my opinion, it was a good feel punishment by gideon cross..<br /><br />I am not going to spoil things but this took place after Brett Kline's concert. He was her ex...<br /><br />Of course, they have their ups and downs as usual since Eva is so insecure about herself. I really felt the emotions while reading the book. The love they have for each other is amazing. For them to sleep separately was a sacrifice. Their nightmares unfortunately came about every now and then. But they still kept the relationship strong. They had to constantly remind each other that there was no one else for them. they were in constant physical contact to remind each other of their obsession with each other.<br /><br />I loved reading the 1st book but reflected in you kept me on the edge. Cary gets hurt and the suspense builds. Gideon starts acting weird and sort of drifts in and out of Eva's life. She gets all confused and frustrated. I finally had the big picture towards the very last chapter. The author put out a very expected twist and it was so good that I couldn't believe it. I had to go back to the previous chapters and I even marked each day with the weekday noted. Call me crazy but I had to re-read certain parts about Gideon and his actions and to understand the time frame that went along with it.<br /><br />It all goes back to how much he loves Eva and that he would do anything for her. Entwined with you will arrive on June 4th and I am ecstatic! I can't wait to go back into Gideon and Eva's world!!
B000A88EV4|5.0|David Thewlis as Johnny in Mike Leigh's Naked, is a force to be reckoned with!  He is as damaged, if not more so, than the unfortunates he happens upon along the way.  I can understand why he won the Best Actor award and Mike Leigh won the Best Director award at Cannes for this film.  After viewing this alone and then with several friends we are still talking about it months later.  It grabs a hold and doesn't let go.  Even though Johnny is despicable you get glimpses of the raw hurt he has endured and that in turn helped shape him into the poor excuse for a human being he has become.<br /><br />The second time I watched it I started seeing the really dark humor of this film and by the third time I was actually laughing at some of the predicaments he gets himself into.  Katrin Cartlidge as Sophie was the other character that I couldn't take my eyes off.  Her performance is spot on and when I learned she had passed away at only 41 I felt a sadness for the the void left - she would have gone on to play other great roles.<br /><br />The northern British accents were hard to understand when I first viewed it alone but then I put the subtitles on when friends came over to watch it and realized I had missed so much the first go round.  DON'T PASS UP THE CHANCE TO OWN THIS MOVIE - you will never regret purchasing it.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I saw this group on TV recently, and they held my attention the whole time....bought the CD...even listened to it this morning on the way to work.  I was just thinking about checking out their website for concert times/locations.  You won't be disappointed with this group regardless of the genre of music you like.....I'm already looking for the next recording.  I give out very few 5 stars, but these guys deserve it.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|About halfway through it was unwatchable.  We had to use the other disk that was not Blu Ray.  Movie is great however.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Or so says my 13 year old who has become a total Whovian! My kids are having a great time watching this series.  Who knew?
B005LAIIKI|3.0|The &#34;hearing impared&#34; function is on and it is hard for a non computer person to figure out how to disarm it. Movie is good but doubt if we watch it again because it is so difficult for us to get the writing off bottom of screen.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|Really a great and catching strategy game. Nice and quick to get into and each match has a unique twist. Dialogue really adds a nice little flavor. If anything, the con is that there is zero replay value and the game can be easy for the strategically minded.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|So, at first glance this game may look adolescent. And in many cases, you'd be right about that. You are presented with mostly simple levels where you have to use you magic notebook to spawn items to address a need for a given situation. For instance, there might be some kid that's hungry and you can just type &#34;hamburger&#34; in your notebook and a hamburger will appear which you then give to the hungry kid. Viola, you passed the level.<br /><br />However, just as you've been coasting along solving dilemmas, suddenly a puzzle comes along that can really stump you for a bit.<br /><br />Overall, the game is very simple and straightforward, but I think it becomes addictive as a result of the creative quality of the gameplay. Since your notebook can spawn pretty much anything you think of, it can be pretty fun trying to come up with different ways to solve the problems.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, I'd recommend just getting it. You'll enjoy it at least for a while and likely for longer than you'd expect.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This fabulous book talks about the barriers and realities of encouraging particular kinds of change, growth, and new patterns - while focused on work, there are a number of examples from other parts of life as well. I particularly liked the breakdown into basic aspects of dealing with change, and the specific case studies scattered throughout the book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Highly recommend this made me feel like I was really a detective....can't wait for the next go around..... recommend this for the detective in you
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. Animation was excellent! I would recommend. I do not think you would be disappointed with this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's okay with Tokyo,but since I have a kindle fire you should do Hawaii and instead of the trains they should be a volcano erupting and the rocks try and hit u and people can be running
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I liked the story till I got to the end- it was shocking to me.  But overall a great movie. I would recommend seeing it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's facebook! What else is there to say? It works great on my kindle fire, and I love the quick access it gives me.
B003UESJF6|5.0|If you are looking for Humor and action you can not go wrong with this one! Great Stuff! Good ending. I would recommend this movie to my friends.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|I have never ever understood why this album took the bashing it did do. It was brilliant in 1970, it is still brilliant in 2013. For those who (like Mr McCartney), don't like Spectre's tinkerings, get Let it Be Naked instead (brilliant too, by the way), but there's nowt wrong with this, nothing. The songs are great, the live ones are great because they are live, such thumping raw energy. 'Two of Us' has real fans hiding from their wives while they cry in a cupboard, imagining a young J and P roaming around Allerton or Speke in short kecks and with grey scuffed shirt collars and ruined shoes. It never happened of course but that is what the song evokes. George's guitar playing makes us think he must have made a short trip down below and come back rather demonic. His licks, in fact the overall sound show how much he and the technology had advanced in 6 short years, and again, much of it live on that blessed roof. I am 51 and from Liverpool; how I (at times!) wish I was 61 and had been in Saville Rowe, London in January 1969. Those lucky lucky people you see on the film, apart from the City squares of course. Ok, it isn't their best album, but this is purely going by the Beatles ' own exceptionally high standards, it still knocked the socks off its main rivals from the time, it still blows away the young pretenders from now. Five stars aint enough. Love it. Always will.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Loved everything about this amazing story.  The 3D effect was great.  The colors amazing.  I usually need to walk away for a  break in most movies but didn't leave my seat.  Great move.
1613822286|2.0|We've all heard something along the lines of 'Dickens / Hardy / Victorian writers were paid by the word.' This was supposedly believed for many years; then it supposedly came out in later times, that that was all tosh. Well, after ploughing through Middlemarch a while back, then this, Vanity Fair, I am not so sure it was tosh / urban myth.<br /><br />There is a good tale here, there really is, but, just like Middlemarch, it is overlaid / encased / runs parallel with an absolute load of bunkum. The basic tale of a reasonably limited number of central / sub-central / supporting characters, is churned to literary gruel by a widening to include not so much sub-plots as minimal below-trivial side stories, side characters, side issues. It was obviously not enough for Mr Thackeray to have, say, the Osbornes, Crawleys, Sedleys and the Diana-Villiers-Maturinesque Ms Sharpe (Yep, bad comparison - Sharpey came first by over a century, but still . . .) book into a hotel perhaps, no, no, that won't suffice; we get the low down on the rest of the guests too, as well as their families at home, their maids and 'boots' etc, and what they did and didn't do. Ok, ole Dicko did this too, but he did it better and more judiciously in a literary sense, but I am afraid to say, at least in my opinion, ole Makey - Thackers just churned out a load of waffling tripe. Worse still, and like the good lady of Middlemarch, these annoying super-padders were the worst possible examples in the old show/tell caper. Where these unwelcome extenders do differ, is that in Middlemarch, it was reams of stuff on the psyche of humanity via author POV, here it is more of the outer planes: who was who, what did they do, WHO did they do, where did they do it and why, and tons of it, and again, the lion's share of this was all in narrative not dialogue, page after page of it.<br /><br />Ok, so we can write off a good 250 maybe even 300 pages of the 900 or so as being unnecessary guff, but what is left?<br /><br />To call the two young ladies - Amelia Sedley and Rebecca Sharp, fresh out of school / college, the main central characters, while not being inaccurate is at the same time too limiting.

For me though, the excess baggage isn't just 'there', it actively spoilt it for me.o call the two young ladies - Amelia Sedley and Rebecca Sharp, fresh out of school / college, the main central characters, while not being inaccurate is at the same time too limiting.

0440238153|2.0|The Amber Spyglass is the third and final part of the His Dark Materials trilogy. There are many many strands to the tale, too many to explain here and by not doing so I suppose prevents spoilers. We have young Lyra from another world, different yet similar to ours, who, along with her friend from our world, Will Parry, have to (after re-uniting after a time), emotionally and physically navigate a world, worlds even, of ever-changing alliances, as they battle to both save the dead, and, rather amazingly, attempt to reach the cold, uncaring sadistic Lord Asriel to help him overcome the might of the creator, and his earthly agents, the church. Sounds good, eh? The trouble is, there are simply too many strands to tie up and these are not done all that well, with much back-story explanations, characters which are just a bit too much, and indeed too many. All in all, a poor ending in my opinion, to the whole trilogy. If it was the complete set I was reviewing, then I think three stars would be about right, but this as a stand-alone, I think only merits two stars.
B003FSTN52|4.0|This is a review of all four seasons of this show, short and sweet:  Excellent acting, very good chemistry among the major players, creative, interesting writing with some intriguing plot twists, calls for suspension of disbelief for many of the court cases presented and even for some of the out of court doings by the major characters, some plot development borders on soap opera inanity. After four seasons, I am still curious what is coming up, in the fifth, but I have a feeling that the writers may have hit the wall, creatively, given how things were stretched very thin, last season.  Stay tuned-----
0307474275|3.0|The first thing that, in my opinion anyway, needs pointing out is the fact that the Da Vinci Code does not match up to neither the super-rave reviews from the book's fans and positive reviewers, nor is it as bad as what seemingly just as many others make it out to be. Before moving on, a little more on this: no matter if a book is good, bad or indifferent, no author should have to be subject to such vile utterances as has been the case with Dan Brown in relation to this book, the second of three so far, of his Robert Langdon tales. I was particularly shocked and saddened to read the words used by a famous British comic actor, raconteur, presenter and writer; how would he like it if others did the same to him over his work? It's ok to dislike something; it's even ok to use very robust words in saying so, but these should never be insulting in nature.<br /><br />Ok, the book itself, although I won't be covering the story as such or at least not in any detail at all; many others will have done this as it's I think 8 years since this was first out, so maybe a non-spoiler review may help the balance. Robert Langdon yet again finds himself unwittingly part of a secret war involving secret societies, symbols, conspiracies involving the church both in their doings and on the receiving end. There are others on the margins, equally as devious, some totally innocent yet perplexed, and Robert is seen to be deep in it, as it were.<br /><br />The most positive reviewers for this work concentrate on things like 'pacy fast-action thriller', it really isn't, not the book, the film yes, the book, certainly not. There are some breakneck scenes, yes indeed, but most is the typical Dan Brown scene of Robert, and occasionally other equally intelligent players, rattling off tons and tons of obscure (and increasingly ridiculous) details and supposed facts about this symbol and its meaning, that personage and his secret doings, that society and their stance on conservatism in the church / the world and more likely bemoaning the lack thereof, and this goes on and on and on and on...<br /><br />But - the biggest problem with this (as well as and more so even with The Lost Symbol), is its shockingly big-nothing ending.<br /><br />A further thought - despite the negatives which are many and serious, despite this you'll still find that for about 300 of the 600 pages or so of most editions, there is a Joe Average tale to be had and enjoyed, and this, just about, saves its hide.<br /><br />All in all, a Joe Average wet afternoon in November in Cleethorpes type of book. In modern terms, according to my daughter - 'Meh'.he world and more likely bemoaning the lack thereof, and this goes on and on and on and on...<br /><br />But - the biggest problem with this (as well as and more so even with The Lost Symbol), is its shockingly big-nothing ending.<br /><br />A further thought - despite the negatives which are many and serious, despite this you'll still find that for about 300 of the 600 pages or so of most editions, there is a Joe Average tale to be had and enjoyed, and this, just about, saves its hide.<br /><br />All in all, a Joe Average wet afternoon in November in Cleethorpes type of book.

B008OW1S3O|5.0|If I really love a band, I always buy a physical copy of the album. With An Awesome Wave now in hand, I can honestly say I do not regret the decision.<br /><br />The only thing I disliked about the album was how the bonus track was set up. When I received my copy, I noticed that the final track &#34;Hand-Made&#34; was not listed. I figured it might be an unlisted, hidden track. I turned out to be correct in my assumption, and the bonus track was simply attached to &#34;Taro,&#34; making it a little over 12 minutes long. I'm not a fan of long breaks between songs, personally, and if I burn another copy for a friend I will probably edit out the long pause.<br /><br /> On a side note (nothing to do with the album's content), there seems to be a huge crack in the case of my copy of the album- right where the CD is placed. This is the delivery company's fault, but I felt it should be made known.<br /><br />Aside from my own personal preferences, the sound of the album is fantastic. Alt-J provides a fantastically eclectic mix of sound; no two songs are too much alike. I'm so excited to finally have this album.
0486278077|3.0|I think the first thing I have to mention is, that this review when it appears, will be a sudden bucking of the trend of 4 and 5 star reviews without a negative word, which will appear in a deep and wide sea above this one when posted, and in time, will no doubt be followed by same - but I can't help that.<br /><br />I think that at this starting point I have to concur with some of the harsh Victorian critics, to some degree (and only that). This is a nasty piece of work; I am talking of the central characters. All of them, including the ladies who indulged them were all heartless ******s. However. . .<br /><br />Many review this when really they are reviewing Wilde. This in my opinion is a big mistake. Whether the book was spiritually introspective is neither here nor there, the fact that Wilde intimated he stepped in and out of the tale at various points, is also irrelevant - it is still a work of fiction. But is it any good, even if the book is devoid of the truly virtuous? I think - yes, but not THAT good.<br /><br />Wilde had a perfect right as a writer of fiction to write what the hell he liked, making his characters as arrogant, elitist and even as evil as he liked; if that wasn't recognised and stamped in law at the time, then it sure is now, thankfully.<br /><br />But how come I cannot give this a 4 or 5 star rating, rather than the 3 I have given this? The reason for this is, the real tale is very, very short, and would have been fine as such, but, Wilde's post first-edition additions and tinkerings then gave us a padded out tale. The endless references of all the gory sensations of history is, to be honest, boring in its length and particularly in its repetitions - spirit of the doings-wise that is. If we could talk to those beyond the grave, I think many folks, if honest, would say, 'We get it, Oscy, we get it; Borgias and racks and lovers and murders and Macbeth, and murderers and murderesses, and the artefacts of same, we get it! Enough!'<br /><br />All that aside. The rest of the book is superbly paradoxical (well in keeping with old Oscys ways, for sure), as in, it is bright and breezy with brilliant repartee, but with those uttering such, being the real scum of the earth, but scum of the earth with the most money, best houses, food and drink etc. But . . .<br /><br />Although the reader gets hammered with many grisly snippets of history, eventually, we then get a very meagre ending, and this was also a contributory factor in my pegging this back to 3 stars. I think just a page or two more on how killing the painting meant killing himself (another now formulaic aspect of supernatural fiction, wonder who started it though? Wilde here? Or did he borrow it too?), actually panned out, not an explanation, just more description.<br /><br />But all in all, 3 stars ain't too bad, eh?l that aside.

B004499LX0|5.0|I had to watch the movie for a college class project and write a essay on aspects of the relationships. Lots of drama unfolds<br />great movie, and I do not want to be any of these types of relationships. gets too crazy.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|God this for my daughter who worked really hard for a reward and wanted this, she had a lot of fun with it and it seems to be just good clean fun, but well you know Disney corp, so anyway, pretty good show, and about as good as Tangled, and a few others. What it and you will likely have a good time in that it is done really pretty well!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Good graphics. Very addicting and I have to collect my coins everyday. I got my mom to convert from being an advid farmville fan to Dinosaur farming.
B008S80OU2|4.0|Blue Oyster cult was one of the great heavy rock bands. There is a LOT of music here. Some of it may seem cheesy at this point but a lot more of it still rocks. Great harmony, blazing and underrated guitar licks and a tight rhythm section BOC is an american classic.<br /><br />One complaint: I bought this primarily for the videos. Some other Enchanted Evening is included as a DVD. It catches a band in their prime giving one of the all time great live performances. It could stand to be re-mastered. The sound is muddy. It did bring back some great memories of seeing BOC in the early 80's live but it's hardly a great representation.<br /><br />I tried to download the 4 concerts that came with the box but they just went into Itunes as MP3s. The site will only let you download once. I'll update this after I hear back from customer service.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|One thing u learn in this game is that u really solve it with imagination!<br /><br />When I started this game, I expected it to be worse than the DS game, but to my surprise it was better! Scribblenauts Remix is a good game to play to pass the time, too. My daughter's love this game, which makes it well worth the dollar!<br /><br />Here are some tips that I had trouble with:<br /><br />If your having trouble with dragging items, try swiping instead.<br /><br />You can't ride some animals because they're too small, but if you add giant or large in front of it, sometimes you can.<br /><br />Speaking of animals, some might not be ridable because they're too ferocious, so try adding friendly in front of them and you can.<br /><br />If you are stuck on a level, look at the question in a different way. In this game expect the unexpected and use your imagination to get through levels!<br /><br />I hope this info helps you on any problem u have. Scribblenauts is a game that won't let your hunger for a good app down and teaches you to use your imagination!<br /><br />  Thanks for reading<br /><br />  -cutekenna
B000002L9W|5.0|This cd is a gem. I've never been a huge Dave fan but very track here is a gem. Steve Vai on guitar, Billy Sheehan on bass. With a better singer this could have been the greatest band ever.<br /><br />The title track is fun as is the upbeat Goin'crazy.<br />The real gems are the cover of the old blues standard Tobacco road and the old TALAS standard Shyboy (written by Billy). Another fun Sheehan tune is Ladies night in Buffalo, a left handed homage to his home town.<br /><br />This is a keeper if you like old Van Halen, great guitars, great Bass or just poppy metal fun
B009NY43NY|4.0|I really like the ending.Reading all Sookie Stackhouse books I was always hoping it will end this way.Charlaine didn't disappoint at all.The only sad thing is that the series is finished.
B003ZJUIGO|5.0|This is probably the best of the greatest hits collections floating around out there. It doesn't have any of the Perfect Strangers material but otherwise a great pick up.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think this game is fun and addicting, but I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it flips over far too easy. Other than that,I am very satisfied.
0756655307|5.0|This book is awesome. It has everything I wanted to know about each and every character that I love about the MARVEL UNIVERSE.  Love it!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Mist for the Kindle.  Really addictive.  Beautifully detailed and it looks great on the Kindle Fire.  Worth the couple bucks.
0307279189|5.0|I have visited the Copper Canyon country in Mexico and enjoyed reading a story about the area and its people.  The characters in the book are fabulous all the more because they aren't fictional.  This book was my first introduction into the world of extreme marathon running and what a crazy world it is.
193700788X|4.0|Had no idea this book would be the last, I'm sorry but not. How many times could Sookie get shot at and beat up, stabbed?? This book tied up all the loose ends in Sookies life, I just wanted m-o-r-e. Hope Ms. Harris comes up with another crazy good book.
B004R1Q296|4.0|What a cursed century was the 14th!  Tuchman follows the various threads of dismay with skill and excitement.  The book is long, make no mistake.  At times I wondered if I really needed to know all of what she presented.  I'm happy I finished it because I find resonance in contemporary events so often: a mark of a great history.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game is the best. its 3D effect is awesome and it is fun killing zombies. you could even do multiplayer. My favoroite part is the new heroes! please keep adding more.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love MLP. And I love how easy it is to get diamonds and how all the ponies talk and other  is a storyline. It's awesome. Addicting but takes time. :)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another story portraying alcoholism and domestic abuse. Sweet love story with a surprising ending. I loved it!  The characters were believable.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|i liked it it was a pretty nice movie. But i thought there would have been more action in it.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|First, loved the cover..very clever!  I like this album more each time I listen to it. Especially with ear buds..I can hear &#34;old&#34; Bowie in it, especially &#34;I'm so lonely..&#34;  Would love to see David out and about more. Would have been great if he played at 12-12-12,the concert for Sandy in New York on December 12, 012.  His presence was missed!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Read it to my child and now we will read it to hers. One of our favourites of all time!
B004P1JEXE|5.0|need to have read the earlier books to really appreciate the overall plot, characters, setting and background history and geography
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I love this band, so it should not be a shock that I love this album, but it surprised me how MUCH I love it - a LOT!  I'm certainly not a teenager, being over 60, and a long-time fan of rock music. I know what I like, and I like this album.  There are some very moving, dramatic songs on here and some upbeat happy songs as well.  If you've never listened to 30 Seconds to Mars before, give the sample sounds a try and then buy the record or download the MP3 - I've done both now.
B00C7D3TRO|5.0|This Album is wonderful. It is definitely different than the usual Fall Out Boy albums, but its a very good different. The lyrics are as good as they have ever been, and the songs are a bit less punk rock. I suppose they couldn't be sixteen forever though. I would strongly recommend this Album to anyone its pretty good.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I am an artist. I bought this cd for husband who plays in a rock band.<br />I decided to listen. The music drew me into the depths where creativity is birthed.<br />My Muse was on fire.<br />The paints are flying. Fantastic.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|great. endless hrs. of fun. the only issue I have is knowing when to quit. this game should be on addictinggames.com
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I just love this movie. It's funny and clever. Simon Pegg is a genius. It's one of those movies everyone must see.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Wow what a great book!! I was sucked in from the first words and that didn't change throughout the book's entirety! I can't review anymore because I have got to get on to the next part of the story.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Works perfectly on my Xoom.  App allows you to easily crop the scans, name, and file them.  You can easily set the quality of the scan, and depending upon the ambient lighting available, choose to use your flash if it is needed - you have to press the small icon at the top left of the screen.  Easily moved into a document and has a number of options for export - the one I use most is Dropbox.  Overall, a great app.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The book started a little slow for me but after that I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with all the characters and could picture them vividly in my mind as I was reading. The author does a great job with the story and imaging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS ITS FUN AND U CAN VS YOUR FRIENDS IF U ARE CUPETIVE I RECOMEND GETTING THIS GAME.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I paid premium dollar for this, having preordered this well before the release date. After being disappointed in the last two offerings by CH, I was hoping that the conclusion to the series would be satisfying. Instead it was farcical. So many people have critically reviewed this drivel better than I could, so all I will say is that I was bitterly disappointed in both the story and the characters' portrayal.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Wonderful new series.  It is never dull.  Always on edge of seat.  Very addictive wqtching.  Now can't wait for season two and three.
B0024FADDI|4.0|When you compare it to the first two its more of a comedy than a horror movie, but its still a good movie.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I regret that I purchased 13 books.<br />With this last book Charlaine Harris has treated her readers with contempt I will never read anything written by her again.
B00005R24K|5.0|This is a must have for any classic horror fan, by far one of the greatest horror movies of all time
B003UESJF6|5.0|this movie flew under my radar when it was in theaters. don't let the same happen to you! or, like me, you'll be forever melONcholy...
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|As an fan of horror films this movie is not only scary but it also has a good balance of comedy as well.
B0013527I4|5.0|wocka wocka! my daughter has become a muppet maniac like mommy. many mornings when I go in to wake her, the dvd player is running the show!
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|Well done!! A great film even better on Blu ray!! Audrey is wonderful as she always is!!!!!! A classic film!!
0060930349|4.0|I like the aspect that history is written  like ordinary story, easy to read and east to understand.<br />The people in colonial period are founder of modern democracy.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|Well done!! A great film even better on Blu ray!! Barbra is wonderful as she always is!!!!!! A classic film 4 all musical fans!!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I listened to the samples of their album and immediately purchased it. Their songs are very upbeat. They have a very different sound and I like the way they write lyrics - very poetic.<br />I put this album on and dance or just close my eyes and daydream!
B00A7W29BE|3.0|So, I have a regular old Kindle Fire. I was excited to see a good scanning app, as I also have a webcomic, and. I have until I get home to sketch my comic out and scan it in for coloring. But... Kindle doesn't have a camera! For that, I give three stars.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I love this album. He is a very talented song writer as well as a gifted musician. I can't wait for his next album!
B00BU18U82|2.0|Dont buy it is poop it breaks down your kindle get minecraft instead. Don't waste your money on this crap
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat keeps getting better and better with each record. This album is the most mainstream one they've recorded. More fans are about to discover what Poulsen and company are all about. Lola Montez, Pearl Hart, and Lonesome Rider have the catchiest sing-along choruses that will stick in your head. Doc Holliday, Room 24, and Black Bart are the heavier tunes on the album with great guitar riffs and impressive vocals. You can't go wrong here!
B00A7W29BE|3.0|I don't have this app, but by the looks of it, it seems you scan a document (or an article etc.) by taking a picture of it and you can save it in your device as a document or PDF.  I admit, that is genius. But, since regular Kindle Fires don't have built in cameras, you can't really scan anything. Based off of another person's review, it seems that you can also scan pictures that are on the device. So, if you don't already have the pic, you can't scan(unless your device has a built in camera).
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I think this game is one of the number 1 games I've ever played. You do levels,challenges, or just zip around on your webs. GET THIS GAME.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|This is a great movie overall as well as one of the few great movies for guitar enthusiasts! Spectacular guitar work!
B004DM0UII|5.0|Works Great, &amp; I have no problems on my Kindle Fire!<br />none if the other music streamers work as nice as this one.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Now days it's near impossible to find a movie you can see and watch over and over and this was one of those rare movies for me. There's just something about the style of humor that was just perfect for the movie and you can't help but laugh each time you watch it. This was a great movie for adults as well as kids!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love it so much I can't wait for the disk to come out so I just signed up for HBO so I can watch the latest season!!
B002RKSCA6|4.0|There have been so many movies, books and cartoons that play on this in some way or another, but the original has always been a lot of fun to read. I had this book as a kid and somebody stole my copy of it so I'm glad I found this for free on my Kindle. It was great to read again after so many years and I still remembered the whole story after almost 20 years.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|If you:<br />A) like Star Trek (a requirement)<br />B) like and &#34;get&#34; Galaxy Quest<br />C) like science fiction<br />D) are partial to Heinlein<br /><br />Then you will appreciate Redshirts.
B000JML7EC|4.0|There are so many different versions of this story out there but nothing compares to the original! Everybody should read this at least once in their life. The original story was so much fun to read and you can really picture yourself right there with all the action. If you love the Treasure Island story, give the original a try some day!
B007REV4YI|4.0|This was as good as expected.  Loved the opening chase scene, but dissappointed to not find out how Bond got out from under the water in the first scene.
B004H4XAXO|4.0|A gripping tale of perpetual warfare against an implacable foe. Nicely satirizing the arbitrariness of aristocracy and our appalling fascination with it. Very disappointing that it reached no conclusion and promised no sequel
B00AJLHUAS|2.0|I'm not sure if the poor sound quality was done on purpose to sound more authentic - but the entire album is a flop.  its not entertaining, its not interesting - its boring and dull.  Maybe I'm not artsy enough to appreciate this &#34;work of art&#34;.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kate Morton provides yet again a great story with a wonderful ending!  There seems to be a bit of a common theme for this authoress's books.  My first read was the best, this was good as well if not a little diluted by my first read!  I will however continue continue to read Kate. I enjoy the richness of her characters and feel I am transported to their locations.
B00985E3UG|4.0|An excellent insight into what's making our foods dangerous for us to eat.  This should be an incentive to all of us to avoid processed foods.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|Pure Crosby, Stills & Nash music. If you are a fan of the sixties you will love this cd. Smooth and mellow music, brings back great memories of a better time.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Quentin Tarantino has never been one to shy away from controversy. From his first film RESERVOIR DOGS he jumped into film making head first, creating films he wanted to see and that apparently the rest of the world has too. The best part of this has been the fact that in doing so he's created some of the most original films around. Such is the case with his newest film, what many thought was a remake of the classic Franco Nero spaghetti western (he even does a cameo here) but is something altogether different.<br /><br />DJANGO UNCHAINED starts off with the excessive bloodshed that Tarantino fans have come to know. Taking place shortly before the Civil War, Dr. King Schultz (Chritoph Waltz) is a traveling dentist who comes across two hunters transporting a group of runaway slaves back to the south. After enquiring about purchasing one to a negative response, he shoots one and wounds the other then \\"purchases\\" the slave, a man named Django (Jamie Foxx).<br /><br />It seems that Schultz has actually given up the practice of dentistry and now makes a living as a bounty hunter. His reason for seeking out Django is that he can identify the men Schultz is currently seeking, high money bounties that will serve his pocketbook. In return for his help he tells Django he will pay him and give him his freedom.

The two travel across the country seeking out the bad guys who seem to pay well for their capture, dead or alive. Along the way the become friends and Schultz teaches Django the tools of the trade to the point where Django becomes one of the fastest guns around.<br /><br />A year passes and eventually the pair track down the men Schultz was searching for to begin with. They collect their bounty and then put into motion the plan it will take to not only find Django's wife but to get her back again. She's been sold to one of the worst plantations in the south, a place known as Candyland and owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DeCaprio). Candie is a man Schultz realizes will not be interested in just selling Django's wife. Instead they will have to con him into inviting them to his home and finding a way to get him to want to sell her.<br /><br />The plan goes along fine until Stephen (Samuel Jackson), Candie's house slave, begins to think something is up. With his advising Candie the question of whether or not Django will be reunited with his wife or end up once more a slave comes into question.<br /><br />With a hot topic like slavery it becomes apparent where the controversy Tarantino arrived from. Depictions of somewhat historically accurate moments in history that many would like to forget are on display in living color. Whippings, dogs turned loose on slaves, branding and more are there for all to see. It does make you feel uncomfortable to watch but at the same time is an effective way to build an understanding of the character of Django and why he acts and does the things he does.<br /><br />What seemed to garner more press was the use of the \\"n\\" word throughout the film. Yes, it truly is a despicable word to be tossed around freely but then again you have to understand that this is a film set in a period of time when it was commonly used and not in the most flattering ways. This was the language used at the time and can be seen not only used by the slave owners but the slaves themselves. Tarantino's decision to use it here seems more realistic than if something had been used in its place. In so doing the vulgarity and ugliness of the word become apparent.<br /><br />This is one of Tarantino's better films. There rarely seems a time when you find yourself checking your watch to see if it's over or not. Theacting is tremendous here with each actor so enmeshed in their characters that you actually believe they are who they are portraying. Over the top scenes seem natural for some of these characters, especially those involving DeCaprio.<br /><br />DJANGO UNCHAINED may not be a film for everyone, but those less sensitive and fans of Tarantino will not walk away unhappy. Instead they'll be pleased to see he's made another film that may cause plenty of talk around the table but at least isn't the usual film to come out of Hollywood.acting is tremendous here with each actor so enmeshed in their characters that you actually believe they are who they are portraying.

B00BEYYEE4|3.0|I've become a fan of Mark Wahlberg over the years. It's fantastic that many have finally gotten past the whole Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch persona that could have been a career ender when it came to acting. The truth is that Wahlberg has shown he has the chops to perform in a dramatic role and make it truly believable. So going into BROKEN CITY I had high hopes.<br /><br />The movie takes place in New York and opens with Wahlberg as Billy Taggert, a police detective who finds himself in the center of controversy after gunning down a supposed rapist in project area known as Bolton Village. While asked to step down by his superior Taggert is praised by Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe). Even though he leaves the force, the mayor makes sure to let him know he'll keep an eye out for him.<br /><br />Fast forward seven years later and Taggert is now a private eye with a ton of bills and clients who more often ask for leniency than pay their debt to him. Then one day he gets a call from the mayor to come see him. Hostetler hires Taggert to follow his wife and get any information on her that he can. Is she cheating on him or is something else going on? The mayor isn't saying but Taggert can't refuse the money he's paying him and begins surveillance.<br /><br />But that surveillance leads to something else going on that is far beyond a simple fling for the mayor's wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The man she meets is tied into the mayoral campaign of Hostetler's main opponent. When that same man is murdered after Taggert passes along the information to Hostetler the entire concept of the film changes from a simple wife having an affair to the complications that go on in an election year.<br /><br />Along the way we are shown that Taggert has been dating the sister of the woman who was raped by the man he killed in the movie's opening. But things don't go well with the two of them and that portion of the film seems wasted. Another reference to the past isn't though as the mayor holds something over Taggert's head, a piece of hidden evidence that he is using to force Taggert to stick with his plans and follow instructions. Only an honest man could find a way to cut through this and take on the most powerful man in New York.<br /><br />The cut throat world of behind the scenes back stabbing and manipulation take the forefront in this story and Taggert's decision to either go with the flow or stand up for what is right are found at center stage before the film ends. With so much on the line and with the murder of an innocent man resting on his conscious just what he will do is pretty much a given but then some movies have taken the opposite direction you expect.<br /><br />So with all this star power as well as the direction of Allen Hughes, half of the brother duo behind hits like THE BOOK OF ELI and FROM HELL, why is it that this movie didn't pull me in and hold me there? Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining film that delivers the goods, but it just doesn't have that oomph feeling that one would expect with the pedigree involved.<br /><br />Both Wahlberg and Crowe seem to be walking through their roles without putting something new into them. These characters as portrayed by these actors feel like we've seen them before. Nothing new is added. Sure they do a great job but as a viewer I expect more from an actor than simply sleep walking through a role. Zeta-Jones is wasted in a part that offers her little. That could be a blessing seeing what the others did with their parts.<br /><br />The movie also has a predictable feel to it, like we know what's coming long before the characters involved do. That may be because films with a story like this have been done before and this one adds little to make it different than the rest. As I stated earlier, this doesn't make it a bad film, it just makes it feel like been there, done that. For Wahlberg and Crowe fans you won't be disappointed. For the rest go in with low expectations and the movie will no doubt satisfy.e movie will no doubt satisfy.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter and she loves it. It can hang on a car seat or use it in the house. It's easy to grasp and big and colorful.
B00B04NJI0|1.0|I've loved many of the horror films that Magnet has been releasing over the past few years. While V/H/S had its ups and downs there is no way you could say that it wasn't a formula that worked in this situation, having several noted horror film directors make pieces of a complete story that interconnected. So one would think that their newest release, THE ABCs OF DEATH, would be a good movie too. Unfortunately that's not the case.<br /><br />The situation is similar but more overblown. Rather than 4-5 directors this time we have 26 directors, one for each letter of the alphabet, given a letter and told to make a short piece involving death. Some run no more than 2 minutes and some longer, but each one is a miniscule time capsule where they allowed the director complete free reign to do as they felt and make whatever they wanted, no holds barred. That doesn't always turn out to be a good idea as is evidenced here.<br /><br />Some of the pieces are actually quite good given the time and budget constraints. Some are mediocre which you might expect. The surprising thing is the number of terrible pieces involved here that seem to outweigh the good ones. Some even go so far as to be as offensive as they possibly can. If you choose to watch keep in mind that the Japanese sense of horror and film is far more outlandish and extreme than anything witnessed in this country. Gore and blood doesn't so much flow in these pieces so much as spew forth in an alarming amount as if blood vessels were connected to garden hoses rather than a single heart pumping the fluid through a body.<br /><br />The more I've thought about this the worse the movie has actually gotten. I watched it last night and decided to let that sit a while before writing. Rather than make the film more palatable it's made me dislike it even more. It opens with a gory beginning piece that uses extreme make up effects to good use when the final punch line is delivered but doesn't remain in that format for long. The better of the pieces are found in the beginning of the film and from there it becomes weirder, more unusual, more graphic and more offensive.<br /><br />Everything can be found here that would please those who seem to think that the world wants exposure to the worst forms of humanity possible. Freddy and Jason are child's play to the things witnessed here. Just to give you a run down of ideas here are some of the things you will witness in this film: Japanese girls who enjoy breaking wind, a women with a 6' by 1' thick penis that includes a giant switchblade sword, claymation toilet monsters, a contest where contestants masturbate while witnessing sexual scenes that start with a nude woman and end with a child being raped (not seen but inferred, still totally tasteless and excessive) and lastly a miscarriage turned into a joke (not funny for those of us who have lived through such a circumstance). I have no doubt that in criticizing such items I will be labeled a prude and told that I just don't understand art. This is one time when I find that more of a compliment than an insult.<br /><br />It's not always a bad thing to have film makers push the boundaries a bit. It sometimes leads to some amazing films. The problem lies when they push the boundaries simply to just push the boundaries, just to shock or simply to just see what they can get away with. That almost always leads to poor film making, poor judgment and just bad movies as is witnessed here.<br /><br />Have I seen films where worse happens than in this film? Sure. Find out about NEKROMANTIC of AUGUST UNDERGROUND and you'll discover what I'm talking about. While those to films have a cult/underground following this film is being marketed as a more mainstream film. Somehow I think that the neighborhood where this film is considered fun or entertaining is far past Elm Street, Mockingbird Lane or the neighborhood of the Addams Family. Unless you just have to see it or enjoy crap posing as art, then my recommendation would be to bypass this film as quickly as possible and pray that a sequel is not in the works.ndation would be to bypass this film as quickly as possible and pray that a sequel is not in the works.

B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Back in the sixties a new sort of character was formed in movies. This was the anti-hero, a person who did the right things but not always for the right reason and who always seemed to do things in the most unorthodox and unapproved ways. Where this was usually the odd man out during the time it eventually became the norm rather than the exception. Over the past few years there haven't been that many successful anti-heroes out there. With JACK REACHER that all changes.<br /><br />Tom Cruise stars as the title character, an ex-military detective who is self assured in everything he does and can back up that attitude. When a man named Barr is accused of being a sniper and having killed 5 innocent people, he tells them to contact Jack Reacher. The problem is no one knows how to find him. That doesn't matter though since Reacher has seen the news story about the killings and heads their direction.<br /><br />It seems like an open and shut case. The gun, the equipment to make the bullets, the van he drove and a quarter with his fingerprint on it found at the scene in a parking meter all point to the guilt of Barr. Helen (Rosamund Pike), his attorney, doesn't doubt his guilt but wants to make sure he isn't executed. Thinking Reacher might be her salvation she's surprised to find that he came here to make sure Barr is put away, explaining to her what he did years ago when he served in the military. But as she talks to Reacher things don't add up and he stays on to become her investigator.<br /><br />If he did nothing more than that the story would be a short one. Instead, those responsible for the killings, attempt to take Reacher out of the picture resulting in some major medical problems to the five men who try to follow through on that order. Rather than brush him off it does nothing more than make him feel certain that there is someone else responsible for the killings and trying to frame Barr.<br /><br />As Reacher delves deeper into the lives of the victims it becomes apparent why these people were chosen, or at least one of them. He continues forward facing down opponents tossed his way, an attempt to frame him for another murder and a slew of bad guys who want nothing more than for Reacher to go away. But that's the problem with an anti-hero. He may have nothing invested in the cause going on but when you push him chances are he'll push back...and much harder than you pushed to begin with.<br /><br />Cruise has become the king of action films with not only this movie but the entire MISSION IMPOSSIBLE series and other films as well. In this film while he doesn't resemble the character from the series of books (a fact that miffed many fans of the series) he does turn in another fantastic performance as Reacher. Reacher is a character that you wouldn't want to anger but that you'd love to have in your corner. Cruise does a great job of making his Reacher believable with ease.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does an equally commendable job, especially Pike who offers a character who could come off simply as a damsel in distress but who instead shows a bit of grit of her own. Noting that she is the daughter of the district attorney trying the case, she butts heads with her father throughout trying to find justice rather than a simple easy conviction for him.<br /><br />Director/screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie has always had a handle on action films, smart ones at that. It would be great to see him continue on with this series with Cruise in the lead but a weak box office return for this film means that isn't likely. Then again hot DVD sales/rentals could change all that.<br /><br />So if you're looking for some top notch action this week look no further than this film. It does it all in spades from fast paced car chases, to shoot outs to well choreographed fight sequences. Action fans couldn't ask for more.s apparent why these people were chosen, or at least one of them.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|With so many movies being released these days it's hard to decide what movie to rent or watch. If you have a particular favorite genre you usually lean that direction. If you hear from a friend you might use that to decide. Most of us rarely step out of our comfort zone though. Make a decision to do that tonight and rent SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.<br /><br />Forget the cover or ads, this is not a romantic comedy. There is romance and there are some funny moments, but the heart of this film revolves around mental illness. Not in the usual depressing sort of way but in a way that opens up discussion about the topic and that makes you realize you can have problems but still find hope.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a bipolar sufferer whose mother gets him released from a mental institution after 8 months inside. Pat went there after he returned home early one day to find his wife in the shower with a colleague and attacking him. This was the trigger that brought about the realization that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.<br /><br />Once home we get a glimpse of where Pat's problems may have begun. His father Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) is a book operator who is slightly OCD to say the least. Problems in the past between son and father are history but at the same time affect much of what happens in the present. Trying to rebuild bridges and solve those problems makes up part of this story.<br /><br />Pat is trying to change his life all in the hopes of getting back with his ex-wife, who has a restraining order out against him. He runs, works out and is reading the syllabus of books she recommends to her students. She wanted him to lose weight, to be better read and to find a way to enjoy life. Now he's trying in hopes of their reuniting.<br /><br />Pat's friend Ronnie invites him to dinner and there introduces him to his wife's sister, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). Tiffany has problems of her own with her husband having died a few months earlier and having just lost her job.  The two seem at first to but heads but eventually a friendship begins to flourish when Tiffany suddenly shows up to run alongside Pat while he jogs.<br /><br />As a bond slowly forms between the two and friendship blossoms, Pat remains focused on his ex-wife.  Tiffany continues to try and build on their friendship, eventually agreeing to get a letter to Pat's ex in return for one favor. She wants him to help her by being her dance partner in a ballroom dancing competition. Pat agrees, anything to bring his ex back.<br /><br />The nice part about this film is the chemistry between the two actors in the leads as well as the supporting cast that surrounds them. There isn't a wasted moment of film used in the telling of this story and you find yourself rooting not only for the main characters but everyone involved here. The icing on the cake is the slow development of the characters rather than the rushed feeling most movies present these days. Instead of Pat or Tiffany suddenly becoming a different ball of emotions, their changes develop as the story unfolds making it a more complete and realistic film.<br /><br />The charm of this film is that you can't help but love these characters as portrayed because they seem so real. You want the best for them, you want them to succeed and until the final moments of the film you're just not quite sure if that will happen or not. It also provides a platform to leap from if there is someone with a mental illness in your real life. The topic has always seemed taboo but films like this will make it easier to approach someone or to open up and say \\"I have a problem.\\"<br /><br />The highest praise I can offer for this film is to say I think it should have taken the Oscar for best picture.

I also use it instead of copying important personal documents, then auto back them up.  It does a nice job on a wide variety of documents even in poor lighting.  It's now an essential app for me - I wonder how I lived without it!

0316228532|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this well-written character-driven book about the politics and difficulties of living in a community. Rowling's engaging and witty writing style and her ability to flesh out characters in every way make this a fascinating read. My favorite aspect of this story was how many angles of the narrative are explored. The reader is provided with enough information and vantage points to carefully turn over and examine each of the many primary characters, their thoughts and motivations. Throughout reading this book, I found my internal opinions and suspicious about characters shifting back and forth. I liked this aspect a lot, though I'll admit that it was sometimes challenging to not have a true MAIN character to mentally hold on to. Still, this is exactly what made this book so interesting.<br /><br />One note: I hope this goes without saying, but The Casual Vacancy is absolutely nothing like Rowling's previous work, aside from what I've noted above. If you're looking for fantasy, magic or a kid-friendly read, this is NOT the book for you. However, if you liked Rowling's writing style and her ability to create engaging and three-dimensional characters -- and you don't mind some more mature themes and content -- then please give it a read.

B008OM0EDO|2.0|This was the worst movie I've seen since Freddy Got Fingered. I thought I would love it. I thought Borat was hilarious, so it's not that I don't \\"get\\" Sacha Baron Cohen's humor. I also think that the premise, a Gaddafi-esque dictator from the fictional country of Wadiya with a team of hot female bodyguards, would make for a very funny movie. The jokes were awkward, poorly timed, and felt forced throughout most of the movie, however. There were only two bits that made me laugh, one of which was already in the preview.<br /><br />If you're easily offended, none of Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy is for you. If you're not easily offended, watch Borat. If you're truly bored, stream this for free on Amazon prime, but you will regret it.

0375826726|3.0|Slightly better than Eldest, I'll give the author that, but it's still sort of slow and the action scenes feel no where near as fluid as in the previous book. The plot takes a long while to really go any where and once again is sort of needlessly long. Still, It's an ok book.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|This case rocks.  The color pretty much guarantees I can find the phone quickly.  It's solid.  Not once has the hard, orange cover budged from the soft, black case.  It's smooth, slides in and out of pockets quickly and easily.  I wouldn't call it slick, but it has nearly slipped from my hands a time or two.  Not at all enough of a worry for me to even look at other covers.  This one is a keeper.

B007ZYABW6|1.0|The BBC showed in 2006 that this supposedly \\"incredible true story\\" cannot be true at all, except for the fact that Rawicz really was a Polish cavalry officer captured, and presumably tortured, by the Soviets.<br /><br />The official records, however, show that he was released in 1941 with thousands of other Poles to join Gen. W. Anders's Polish Army. Stalin sent these troops to Iran, where they were turned over to British command to fight against Hitler.<br /><br />Rawicz never produced a shred of evidence to support his story of a 4,000-mile trek over desert wastes and frozen peaks - which on top of extreme danger, starvation, thirst, heat, cold, etc., includes such unlikely components as a kindly NKVD commandant's wife who encourages Rawicz to escape, an American prisoner named \\"Mr. Smith,\\" a beautiful refugee girl who joins the escapees, and an account of observing some yetis for several hours in the high Himalayas. (The yeti or \\"abominable snowman\\" became a topic of great interest in Britain and America only two or three years before \\"The Long Walk\\" was published. Coincidence?)<br /><br />According to the BBC, not even Rawicz's heirs insist that the story is true, even if he did: [..] (Amazon has deleted the link, but you can find the info easily.)

B0007OY2P8|5.0|Here's the thing, if you are expecting a version of Northanger Abbey to compare with the BBC/A&E Pride & Prejudice you will be disappointed.  This version is strangely acted and strangely shot with some pretty interesting background music...think lots of 1980's saxaphone music.  Many Janeite's abhor this film.  BUT, if you are a fan of Peter Firth, I think you will be entertained.  I loved it with all its strangeness and it made me want to reread the book...which is really what Jane Austen is all about, right?
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Excellent reading held my interest all the way through. Made me think of all the injustices of humanity. Read the book and you will understand
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This book is what got me looking into North Korean camps and laws. Not only does Shin's story give you a gruesome look at life inside a modern Hell, but it allows you to see beyond the camp and into what North Koreans deal with all the time. This book is exceptionally talented for finding insight about defectors.

B00AFEY354|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a tender drama from start to finish. This movie is beautifully acted, beautifully written, and beautifully directed. This movie is based on a young adult novel of the same name. I never read the book but the guy who penned the novel also wrote the screenplay and directed this film, Stephen Chbosky. Chbosky is a gifted storyteller and visionary. I love how this film is set in the early 90's, I love the music, I love how much this film has heart. They sure don't make films like this anymore! Logan Lerman who plays Charlie gives a tour-de-force performance. His body language and eyes tell so much even when he's not uttering a single word. Charlie is a shy, high school freshman. He is suffering from depression, at first you think he's sullen because he is dealing with the suicide death of his best friend, but then once you get deeper into his past...you begin to realize he is struggling with a lot of childhood demons and blocked memories. Emma Watson (love her American accent) and Ezra Miller also star. Their characters, Patrick and Sam take Charlie under their wing, and try to help him break out of his shell. Paul Rudd and Joan Cusack have small roles as well, but very important roles I might add. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a film that you will enjoy watching again and again. This film made me cry, it made me laugh, and it made me think about my days as a shy, insecure teenager. I highly recommend this gorgeous coming-of-age film, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I had the air force pilot knife and the tip broke on it during a batoning test at home, I also learned that the full tang on it is really a wire tang (wanna be full tang...meh).<br />So after many review & youtube videos I decided on BK2, I do many solo trips in remote wildernesses and really needed something solid, it batons like a champ and the heft inspires confidence in heavy usage. I like everything on this knife except that retaining strap just ripped off on the 2nd day of my trip. I ended up using a small bungee cord to hold it in place. I will see if K-bar would send me a replacement otherwise I plan to fix it  myself. I think the rest of the sheath is ok and do not plan on spending $100 plus for a aftermarket one. Also, there are some cool mods that people have posted online as far as adding a sharpening stone, ferrous rods etc are concerned.

B00BUT5IAC|5.0|Since the death of Layne Staley in 2002, Alice In Chains founding member Jerry Cantrell vowed not to continue the band. Several years later, he changed his mind and got in contact with drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Inez. Together they searched for a new lead singer and after a relentless search, they found Atlanta, Georgia native William DuVall. DuVall (who's past work include co-writing the 1994 hit \\"I Know\\" for fellow Atlanta native Dionne Farris) was initially met with resistance by some longtime fans of Alice In Chains. They signed a recording contract with Virgin Records and recorded the 2009 comeback album \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\"- an album that showed that DuVall was actually a great fit for the band. The album was well received and left many wondering if they were going to do another one. At the end of 2011, they went into the studio to record their fifth album- and second with William Duvall. Before they could release any material at the end of 2012, EMI Music- the parent company to their label Virgin Records- was bought out by Universal Music Group. Corporate shake-ups happened within the company and as a result, Alice In Chains were moved to Virgin's sister label Capitol Records.<br /><br />In 2013, they released a new album \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\". On this new album, they reunited with \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" producer Nick Raskulinecz- who's best known for his work with the Foo Fighters, Stone Sour and Evanescence. Musically, this album picks up where the last one left off. Jerry composes all of the songs with the exception of five he wrote with the band members. Starting off the album is the track \\"Hollow\\" which leads into the indifference theme of \\"Pretty Done\\". They emphasize their trademark sound on the album's second single \\"Stone\\", where they sing of refusing to let someone read their mind. On the seven minute title track \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\", they tackle the touchy subject of religious views. On the song \\"Breath On A Window\\", Jerry sings of wanting to leave the past behind. While Jerry Cantrell sings lead on most of the songs, William DuVall takes the lead on \\"Phantom Limb\\" as well as the ballad \\"Hung On A Hook\\". \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" is another excellent album from Alice In Chains. They haven't strayed from what they do and their music still holds up even after almost 25 years. So far, this recording could be a contender for the best album of the year.dow\\", Jerry sings of wanting to leave the past behind.

B008FPOIT6|4.0|A solid read.  Fun, interesting and fairly original.  And if you are a bit of a bibliophile you will enjoy the juxtaposition between technology and old school paper!<br /><br />Worth a summer read.  Not the greatest book but it does entertain.

Plus I had many of the puzzles completed.  Now today I opened the game and only had 40 coins and all my prizes were gone.  The puzzles have all been reset as well.  I have to start all over!  This is not what I was expecting.  Just not happy with this game right now!  I may just delete it.

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I loved it when it aired on t.v. and I loved it even more on DVD because I can watch this as many times as I please! It is an amazing show with so many twists and turns you think you see coming but you really have no idea what it is that is around that corner. I can't wait to get the other seasons on DVD!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I purchased this book not knowing what to expect. After a slow start to the book, I was unable to put the book down. I regret that Mr. Larsson was not alive to enjoy the well deserved accolades for his book. As usual, the book was much more detailed than the movie version.

B002M5E2DW|1.0|Anyone with an iota of common sense and intelligence should not read this book, unless they would like to live a delusional life, and no there is no formula in here to get you rich or find happiness.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is a wonderfully written, deeply engaging book. As someone who has struggled with her own demons, and found solace in nature, I am impressed with Cheryl Strayed's ability to tell this story. I read almost the entire book in one evening, staying up very late just because I couldn't stop reading. My sole complaint has nothing to do with the actual writing, but rather with why the Kindle edition contains so many markups by Oprah. Many Kindle books have similar markups, some by other readers, however, in all other cases you may select to turn off these irritating marks. For some reason, when Oprah adds her markups, it is impossible to turn them off and the reader is forced to know exactly what Oprah thinks of various passages. Oh well, I still think the book is fantastic and now I know never to purchase another \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" edition.

B00A50PBEA|5.0|This is a fantastic English-language adaptation of Mozart's \\"pop\\" opera, The Magic Flute.  Some have blamed Branagh for the sentimentality of the film, but this is a children's story that is supposed to read as a fairy tale.  In truth, the film is a stunning re-imagining of the opera, with a World War II setting that poignantly explores the battle between good and evil.<br /><br />It's amazing that this film was made in 2006, yet is just now receiving a U.S. release.  Can't wait to see it in theaters June 9!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This series is great all the way through.  Unlike with so many books, when I re-read it there was no time that I thought to myself, &#34;just have to get through this part to get back to the good stuff.&#34;  Give it a try, you will enjoy it too!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Who knew zombies could be so entertaining? Great series!!  Very creative and wonderfully written.  Can't wait for more the next season!!!
193700788X|1.0|Some Spoilers (but not too many)<br />My rating of one star was not given in anger or haste.  This book was disappointing on so many levels.  It feels like Ms. Harris did one of two things: hired a ghost writer or extended what was supposed to be a short story into the final novel of the series.  The plot was difficult to follow.  Characters were thrown into this final story that had no place in my opinion.  It was as if Ms. Harris said who can I bring back to make this more confusing?  I still don't understand why Claude was able to make it out of fairy but none of the others could come to help Sookie once they knew he escaped. I hold no ill will against Charlaine Harris.  For whatever reason the series did not end with a bang but a whimper.  I do feel that she owed her characters and her readers more.  Yes, they are Ms. Harris's characters to do with as she wishes.  That said she is selling a product that people need to want to buy.  I've been a fan of Harris's other series and enjoyed this series up to this book.  But I'm glad that my local library will have the next book available because I will save my money for someone who wants to entertain the readers and give their characters a story worth telling.  My advice, save your money.  I hope that Ms. Harris will write more stories and think of not only herself but her readers as she does so.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|The movie was well-done but had a few cliff-hangers. My interpretation was that in the time of disaster, man being the higher life form, is able to survive when lower life forms crumble and can no longer exist.  It brings the message that man is an innovator with power of endurance that is unmatched.
B00C5ZNUCS|5.0|Ghost: It's well played and melodic Pop/Doom/gothic metal/rock. The musical style is something between Blue Oyster Cult meets the late 60's, meets Anton Lavey's Satanic Mass. The vocals are crisp and clean, the harmonies beautiful and the instrumentation more ear catching than fast. In a world where power chords and growling are all the rave, Ghost takes us back to a time when music was about hooks, foot tapping and tunes we hummed for weeks on end. I devoured this album like a music junkie, and by the time the final track played out with a choir singing, \\"Come together, together as one. Come together, for Lucifer's son.\\" I had goose bumps. Yes, this music is out of step with the trends of the day, and yes, it is satanic... But it's all those things in the right way and I love it!
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|Wonderful worship experience. Enjoyed every song. Learning these songs for sharing with our Praise & Worship team at church. Excellent!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|well what to say; great continuation,this story has me soo hooked, i wish it would have kept going,,,but great season,great ending...
B00BK5D95C|4.0|Can't argue with all the praise being given the band for their creativity and originality. But I swear that, vocally, esp. on songs like \\"Matilda\\" and \\"Ms\\", the singer sounds like Adam Sandler (and in a few other places too). It's distracting -- like if Radiohead was covering the \\"Hannukah Song\\" or something. Fortunately, it doesn't happen often, and the sheer melodic uniqueness of the album overall will keep it on my playlist for a while to come.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game can't get enough of it, love playing to me very relaxing game and also challenging more should try if you love playing games.
193700788X|5.0|The Sookie Stackhouse series has been scrutinized from all angles solely because Harris wrote such a wonderful book series.  CH puts her very strong characters on very unexpected paths and I was personally charmed that she both began and ended the series with a mystery.  I thought it was a very fitting end to the series and although Sookie will be missed dearly, I was very happy to follow her for thirteen books and would have followed her for thirteen more.  Thank you CH.  If you have read other parts of the series and haven't had the pleasure of ending it just yet, I hope you enjoy.  CH brings closure to all of the characters and does justice to her charming characters she introduced us to.

0385360169|5.0|I ordered audio I do not have allot of time to read so while I sketch I listen and I find  myself stopping my sketching to listen to ever word.  And the more I  listen the clear picture of Christian Bale as Christian Gray is so vivid in my mind and the lady who played in Gilmore girls sorry name escapes me .  I saw his face immediately as I got into the story of Christian  and Anna played out. Everyone has their ideas of whom he is in actors but pretty boys just do not cut it it has to be someone handsome , and can do dark and tormented and I think you see that in BAtman with Christian BAle.  Anyway I finished to the break up and gasped I had not ordered the other two so I quickly  did order them and waiting for them to come in the mail.  I must say I enjoyed the light humored parts and  the sexual was very graphic , loved the  reveals of their personalities  and could relate to some of it at different levels.  HIs harshness on her spankings 6 times  I did not see as the breaking point but maybe someone who has never been through real harsh pain or hard life this might be their breaking point.  I would think  harsher methods would be more of breaking point ,but love his gentle times with her, and how grounded she is . Really can relate to how green she was ;as most people when they meet someone so overwhelming to them, if they are lucky enough to, in this life time. Nothing comes without baggage ,<br />it just depends on how much of the baggage one is willing to accept.  Loved it so far!  Where do you draw your ideas or refernces to create this story was any of it experienced or known of by someone close?  Crack babies very good to explore what happens when they grow up another area not really explored I think give much food for thought, most the desire to see CHristian fall and change for  Anna that is the romantic me talking.  Good Luck with more!  Angela MBK

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|First I am an adult not a young adult.  For starters it was well written, and edited well.  I say that because I read a lot of free books and some are truly bad.  Now that being said the story kept me reading.  I read one bad review that compared it to Harry Potter, I did get that feel in it.  Do I feel that I got my $9 worth, no.  I think its trying to hard to be there with Harry, and the Hunger games and Twilight.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Just now starting to get my folders set up and pinning  all kinds of stuff I like . There is a lot of interesting things from category to choose from . Busy looking through all the categories yet .  Once everything set up I'll like this app even better !  Still getting use to it .!
0143038583|4.0|I would actually give Michael Pollan's book 4.5 stars.  It has a lot of important, good information, particularly in the first half; and is entertaining reading.  The chapters on industrial farming, big 'organic' business, the innovative Virginia farm, and mushrooms are fascinating.  I withhold 5 stars, however, for the tiring chapter on hunting.  I realize in the 21st century many folks are at best ambivalent about hunting.  But instead of stating his moral dilemma and getting on with the story, Pollan drones on way too long.  Mr. Pollan is middle aged, and eats meat, so please give me a break.  Other than that, he does a great job and provides a very important service with the production of this book.  Its well worth your time.

B004LP3AYI|5.0|Well just finished my reading of Terry Goodkind's 2nd novel in the series. I have to admit a lot of chores have been waiting patiently while I finished this book. I love to bury myself into wizards and strange beasts from time to time. I could hardly put the novel down.  The book keeps us interested in the travels of Richard a budding wizard and Kaylah a magical figure herself. The quest that tear them apart and journey of love that pushes them to reconnect. A lot of short stories thrown in captivates you to the end of the book. Sorry it ended but my house has been neglected. Looking forward to the 3rd book. A good read.

B00C7L4QB4|5.0|Mads and Hugh bring this show to life - finally, we have a Hannibal to live up to Anthony Hopkin's original turn.  Mads is refinded, brillant, cunning and merciless yet we also see more of his humanity while Hugh's redition of Will Graham is awe inspiring.  The character is darker than anything I've seen him in; Will is disconnected to the living yet painfully one with the dead and to see him struggle not losing his mind is breathtaking.<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburne is fabulous in this too; it's reminiscant of his role of Morpheus without the ridiculous.  He's tormented, driven and powerful; we love it when he orders people out hehe.<br /><br />I pray this isn't cancelled because my husband and I will be watching every week!

B001ANYDAO|5.0|Gladwell's books are absolutely fascinating. The topics he explores often seem completely mundane, however, the angle he takes on all of these subjects are completely unusual. The end result is a greater understanding of the subject matter and more importantly, a greater understanding of the processes being described in the books.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|love love  love  love, don't get to see it on sundays since I work but yay got to see it now

B00632HWOG|1.0|I am so sorry I up greated to the newer app of yahoo its the worst ever never can down load my messages without unsubscribe and then resubscribe the app anyone have suggestions?  yahoo could care less
0596007124|5.0|I have a degree is CS, but I bought this book as a recommendation from my employer.  Unfortunately for my  $50,000 schooling, they didn't teach me anything about design patterns!!!  This book really hits it on the head though, and I'm very glad I bought it.  It presents exactly what you need to know in an easy and fun to read format, making it much less of a textbook and more of a &#34;Hey look at all this cool stuff you can do with software!&#34; book.<br /><br />Thank you for this book!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Ok so I'm a girl and I even like this game because it's really nice to have a game so cool as this one
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Kevin's performance brings the whole thing from good to great. Was a little unsettled by the ending. It was...expectedly unexpected? Want to give it 5 stars. Almost.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Great family movie, especially if you have daughters who you want to be independent. Very nicely done and humorous yet serious.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It wont ever open the app after i bought it so its just not fair because i spent my own money on it
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|really enjoy.  wish you could sleep foe energy so it could be played longer.  don't like to buy energy and think its fun.
B007STBUHI|5.0|Entertaining movie that scared lots of people from going into the ocean when it first came out.....good special effects for it's time
B0000630YA|3.0|Would not play on my computer. Played ok on a cd player. Thats not what I wanted it for.  Why can't life be simple!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|It was very interesting, funny, and totally unexpected. It was also a bit gory, but I guess that's required these days.
0553801473|2.0|I was a big fan of the previous books but this is just a tedious, boring read. I found myself wishing for it to be over. Fans waited six years for this?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing app well done, very detailed, very easy, not boring, Designed well, very fun, try it out, you won't regret it
0385349947|4.0|Excellent with respect to situations encountered by women in the workforce who are interested in upward mobility. I was surprised that there was no discussion about the financial agreements between partners when both are working. For example, if stock is awarded to one partner is it held jointly by both.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very well thought app.excellent way to keep track of your battery and also keeps you from charging unnecessarily.Thank You Very Much,Love It!
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|This being the last book ended very boring and not how I expected.... But was still another book that I couldn't put down!

B00CL68NOG|4.0|This was a fun picture. Not a great one, but good fun. And both leads did a good job.I recommend it as a rental.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I've loved Ennio Moricone since I first heard the soundtrack from The Mission. Hearing his most popular compositions played by Yo-Yo Ma brings a new energy to the music. Ma raises the level of the pieces in every case. I have given this compilation as a gift to many people. It's one of our family's all time favorites.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Despite the fact that it is not a Michael Crichton's &#34;pure blood&#34;, the history is very entertaining and allou you to look the world around us from a different perspective.
386521584X|5.0|This book has a place of influence in the history of photography, especially street/straight/American photography. As you 'read' it, pay attention to the context of each photo and the order they are in in relation to each other. It's almost like a movie made up of still photographs. You find new meaning each time you flip through.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a very challenging game! It becomes harder and harder as you play along. The colors are very vibrant.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line and hated to stop reading.  I even opened and read parts of Wool on the Kindle app on my phone while waiting for the kids to get out of school.  I can't think of another book that had me interested enough to switch from one device to another and back to keep reading.  I've passed the story on to my high school daughter as a must read this summer.  I love that the book is suitable for multiple age groups.  It was refreshing that it was a great story which wasn't marred by a lot of foul language and graphic sex scenes.  I will be recommending this series to friends.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|All in all great books.  An interesting transition in literary styles.  Murder mystery through crime drama.  In all great characters and good reads.
B000BCE7QU|1.0|The album is horrible. Only one song is kins of acceptable, Appetite Acoustic. Very disappointed with the rest of the content.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So glad I purchased this season. Another great reason to be a Prime member!<br />I am halfway through this season and I couldn't be happier with the progression of the story and the character development.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|And a collection of everything from the 3 days. There are blueprints for that online... It's all about the music.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Can't wait to see the live!!!<br /><br />This album has been playing non-stop since I got it.<br /><br />i LIKE THE REMIX!!!
0811836363|5.0|Arrived quickly.  It is a gift for my 12 y/o daughter whose 'boy band' is The Beatles! YES! I'm sure she'll be absolutely thrilled by it.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This is my first venture into Daft Punk. I have never bought their previous albums and my experience with their music is pretty much through their previous hits being played on the radio.  Probably like many, their first single \\"Get Lucky\\" was what intrigued me to purchase this album.  The rest of the album sounded similar with some utilizing more autotune-type vocals.  Lyrics were not really deep and may be senseless for some.  However, I really liked the jazzy and funky sound of their songs which can be very relaxing to listen to.  It reminds me of a mellow and relaxing afternoon at your local coffee shop (not those of the major chain ones).  Its a good album also just to listen to at home while winding down for the day.<br />One reviewer did comment on the songs being too slow.  This is pretty much the case especially compared to their previous songs such as \\"Around The World\\" and \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\".  The only up tempo song in this album is \\"Contact\\" but still not as up beat.  Either way, this is still a good album to listen to.  Not really what I expected fom this group given their songs from their previous albums.  Something different but not necessarily bad.
0670026638|5.0|I found myself thinking more than once \\"I truly love this novel\\". It made me angry and happy, I laughed and I cried. I think it made me a better person. I loved the characters like I really knew them and I really want to know what happens with Nao, where is she now. I want to hug her, as simple as that. I also want to thank and congratulate the writer for spending 6 years of her life writing this gem. It came in the right moment of me life, to make me realize I am a time being too. :)
B005LAIHYU|4.0|The lead actor looks like a very young Liam Neeson. His vamp BF is the guy who played Tony Stark's dad in Iron Man 2. The acting is awesome, the effects are awesome, just go ahead and suspend all disbelief and enjoy the ride because this is funtastic cracked out nonsense. The chase over the backs of running horses, the axe fights, the fangs, it's all worth it. You know you wish American history was like this.
B008J34466|5.0|It's all in the title. An absolutely fantastic cd and well worth the buy. The only thing better would be seeing her live!
0451232852|5.0|although i am still reading this book, im a slow reader, i really am enjoying the book. It has history and a great story of all the people from all the countries that were involved in the war. Mr Follett has not only given a history lesson, he has also given a great perspective on the lives of how the people of each country were involved , family, loved ones..I would recommend this to anyone who likes history.
0226039331|5.0|For those looking for the definitive New Testament Greek lexicon, this is it!  Provides an in depth definition of every word in the New Testament looking at the word as used in the New Testament as well as other Greek literature during biblical times.  This work is a must have for serious Bible scholars, expositors, and biblical language buffs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is AWESOME!!!!  It gets REALLY addicting after awhile when u play it more. I probably couldn't live if I couldn't play this!!!  Thanks to Amazon or whoever made this app update the app to Miami today for me. THANK U!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a great game. My 20 year old sister wanted to play! I recommend this game not just for kids but adults to. Also check out temple run 2 it has better game play and better graphics! Also check out temple run: brave.
0345410025|5.0|Just finished reading the book and it touched upon many common problems people have but don't pay much attention too. Very interesting. Some of the ideas suggested are a bit silly but regardless can be extremely useful if applied. I really enjoyed it and feel it was useful, a nice addition to my room's library.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This second book of the hunger games had a lot of symbolism. I enjoyed reading it but wouldn't liked to see more from Collins. It was predictable and left me hanging. I can only hope the third book will be okay.
0525425772|4.0|I am very much enjoying the Theodore Boone Kid Lawyer series from John Grisham.  I have enjoyed very novel in the series very much and this latest addition is just as good as the others.  I very much look forward to the next one in the series.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|kept suspense up, acting good, script good, I like the ones based on true stories, footage of the devastation breathtaking
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Really rates high for what I use it for.  Works very well on the asrock Z77 board.  Affordable price ,too
B007REV4YI|4.0|First copy came defective but amazon took it back. We agreed with my husband that the movie was good. Not great. Product delivered as promised.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Ahemmmmmmmmmm, love the film but no pre-sale for 3-D Blu-Ray? Why did I buy my 3-D bluray and TV?? And will it happen? I thought the movie was actually the best in the three movies!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book completely sucked me in. I love period romances and the extra bonus of a magical circus was icing on the cake for me. The love story is subtle and slow rather than in your face. I liked that the characters are still \\"characters\\" but not over the top in your face ridiculous.Even in battle there is a subtly because it is not bloody or violent it is more wonderouis to see what the opponents will come up with next.<br /><br />As debut novels go this one was stunning. There is a lot of drivel out there touted as the next best thing that really dissappoints and this book is a stand out amoung all the newbie writers taking their chances with e-publishing.<br /><br />By the end of this book I desperately wanted to eat one those fantastic carmel apples and take a stroll through every exhibit. The love story is beautiful, but the circus is worth visiting over and over again.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when it first came out, but seeing it in 3D was very, very entertaining!  I recently purchased a 3D TV so I am building my movie collection.  This was a nice one to add to it.  The dinosaurs looked real in 2D but they are truly amazing in 3D.  I am very pleased with this movie in 3D.  Good purchase!
B006LSZECO|2.0|*Spoilers* It looks like I'm not the only one who went out and grabbed this up due to the hype and ended up scratching my head at the end. There's a point in which the vindictive nature of everyone involved just becomes too much. The beginning is great. It grabs you and you root for Nick to be the misunderstood hero by the end who gives a @*#$. Amy and Nick deserve each other. It is hard to read a book when you have nothing left but an apathetic disgust for everyone in it.<br /><br />This author has a lot of potential, hopefully she will dial it down on the manipulation for her next go around.
B00BMQDM10|1.0|The worst book written by Sophie Kinsella. I did not want to give it even one star as it is so unlike this author and such boring book.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Cline does a great job twisting your head and having fun with the trivia from the 80s... and that last game Parzival had to play?  Priceless !
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This was purchased for my 14 year old daughter. Her and her friends have watched this movie over and over and over again. Great buy!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|The only reason I am leaving a review is because when I open the game, it keeps promising something good if I do.<br />That being said, this is a pretty fun game. The graphics are good &amp; though I haven't seen the movie, I assume the characters are on par. The quests are simple enough, while still making sure you progress at a metered rate. I find myself going daily to collect my resources.<br />This is probably worth 5 stars, if only it didn't promise Rewards for Reviews. At least it didn't demand a 5 star review to get your goodies, lots of apps do.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|This album really shows Vampire Weekend's maturation as a band. They've come out with three perfect albums, not many bands can say that. If you don't already own their first two albums, buy those as well.
B001IYCMNA|3.0|This access point provides some incredible coverage.  The only problem is, it does not maintain an N signal.  I run it in G-only mode and everything works great.  I would like to run it in mixed mode, but every time I shift to that, the Access point continuously drops signal.  I have updated the firmware to the latest, but that did not fix the problem.  The features of the Access point have made me decide to deal with a G only wireless network.  I like that I have separate wireless networks for different purposes.  It has a lot of advanced features that make this Access point very versatile.  I would consider upgrading my rating to 5 Stars if I could run Wireless N.
B000051Y0G|4.0|Seeing as this is the only cd I've ever heard by her,it's hard to compare to the others.Definetly a trip back to the 80's.Good memories.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This little game makes fun. the only Bad point is the high prince for extra content, but also the loading screen is Too overloaded
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing! When I finished the book I couldn't wait to see the movie. The only depressing part which I like one part like that but not many if them, is when rue dies. In the middle of the book an unexpected rule change happens leaving a huge twist to the story. This book has a nice ending leaving you to want to continue the into the next books. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a book that will keep you on the edge of there seats with cliffhangers, action, and suspence. Although I don't recommended for anyone young.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|i find it to be very entertaneing for me as well as a good game for my young grand children
B007G8SET8|5.0|This is an awesome set from the NWOBHM 80's rockers Saxon.  This 2 disc CD set features all the Saxon classics.  Plus the live DVD captures Saxon delivering yet another powerful live performance.  So turn the clock back to 1985 and turn up the volume and enjoy the  &#34;Heavy Metal Thunder!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids enjoy this game with so many games to chose from it keeps them busy for awhile which gives me time to do my school work
B00BMEF8UA|5.0|An awesome double live CD!  Great musicianship and songwriting.  A high energy performance!  An AWESOME BAND to see live!  So if you liked &#34;Live After Death&#34; by Iron Maiden or &#34;Unleashed In The East&#34; by Judas Priest you will LOVE this CD.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I truely love the ploting of his books full of twists and turns. It keeps you rushing to the end.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is indeed a \\"Wonder.\\" I will definitely have my to middle school-aged sons read this book. It teaches kindness, acceptance, friendship, love, honesty, trust... I could go on and on.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I already new the story.  Just wanted to reread it before I saw the movie.  Just what I expected.  Good read
B0063IH60K|5.0|waaaay better than the old windows game.  plenty of flexibility and a auto-fill feature when you win.<br />lots of undo steps let you back up and try a different strategy.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|It was awesome! Everything that I had expected it to be. Was satisfied with the product and would purchase again.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game gives you the expirence to restore the elements of harmony meet new pony's and turn nightmare moon back to princess Luna
B00CW665VI|5.0|I really liked this book! It was so sarcastic and funny. I literally laughed out loud in quite a few places. Congrats to the author for writing a man that sounds like a man. I love that he's unapologetic about being a total douche. And yeah, he's a man whore, but he doesn't promise anyone anything he doesn't deliver on and so I didn't hate him. He's straightforward about what he is so I had no problem rooting for him and laughing with him. Great read, just don't read it expecting it to be a beautiful, touching love story cause it's not. It's honest and funny and great, but it's not Danielle Steele.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Forced only by life, was I able to put this book down.<br />Well written and an wonderful refreshing validation of what lies beyond.
0307352153|5.0|This was a very interesting book. Whether you are an extrovert or an introvert, you will learn a lot about the different temperaments.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|in the first 50% of the novel things move quite slowly but the end will leave you on edge<br />make sure you have time when you pick it up because its impossible to put down
0385523394|1.0|I bought this book for my sister.  She is currently serving 2 years at Danbury Federal Prison.  If you are looking for a book to explain federal prison camp life - look elsewhere.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is the book I went to after 50 Shades of Grey and I'm impressed! I actually read it faster! This book seems more mature and better written.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|I bought this DVD because it said there were special features like commentary by J.J Abrams. But that was a total lie. There were zero special features. Very disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series never gets old. I can watch it over and over without getting tired of it.  Very well done.  I did not like the ending.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|What else can I say.  I loved the movie, and had to buy it on Blu-ray.  I would highly recommend doing the same if you like the movie.
B007SGM084|4.0|Well, I did it ... I dove right into the world of 50 Shades with the rest of my friends and co-workers.  I have mixed feelings about this book, and believe me; it has nothing to do with the fact that there is sex in this book. I love a good smut novel! I very much enjoyed the story. I find it an intriguing tale of a good girl who finds the courage to explore the darker side of her sexuality at great risk. The flip side of that coin was equally as intriguing about a man who has enclosed himself behind protective walls finding the courage to let someone behind them to see the world from his eyes, also risking his heart.  And then, all around that coin was corporate intrigue!<br /><br />Two things distracted me from this very entertaining trilogy:<br /><br />1.)Repetitive phrasing.  That Christian smell! His Christian scent! Sexy as hell! And that was just a few. To hear a phrase that the character might \\"say\\" a few times in a book sure. But our Ms. Steel thought these phrases over and over and over. Every few pages you would find one of the above phrases and I found it very distracting. It was as if the author could not come up with other clever ways of describing the same feeling. Now, this is probably just me, however, it is one of my biggest peeves which I find that some authors do. For me, this can really distract from a good book.<br /><br />2.)Believe it or not, the sex. Not that there was sex. Please, I knew there would be sex. I looked forward to it. What I didn't expect was so MUCH of it. When reading a story, especially one of seduction, I find that the author must do exactly that ... SEDUCE THE READER. It started off promising and there were a couple of really good sex scenes in the books. But then they just ... how do I put this politely ... any little thing would set these two off into a monotonous bump and grind. Honestly I found myself skimming over many of the sex scenes to get to the meat of the story. I just thought many of the scenes lacked that needed build-up and sexual tension that left me wanting. The author only achieved this a hand ful of times out of the over-done many sex scenes.<br /><br />Honestly, I feel that, even if the author would have only used  1/4th of the sex scenes she did, this story would still have been well worth reading. I found myself wanting to know what happened next with almost every page turn in all three books. An excellent, well developed, well written read that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I recommend it to anyone interested in a little mystery and romance with a good firm spanking on the side!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|game moves along quickly with fast touch response making it fun and enjoyable as well as challenging.<br />highly reccomend it for relaxing play.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book review can be kept short and sweet for a simple reason ... it was a short and sweet read. I enjoyed this story very much. I found I was able to relate it to my own college years and found myself laughing at many of the scenes. Well developed, personable characters added enhancement to this bad-boy meets good girl tale.<br /><br />  There were only two things that kept me just a tad at bay with this book were:  1.) I kept finding myself wishing for my own daughters that they would not overlook all the red flags that our leading lady tended to overlook in our leading man.; and 2.) the whole \\"mobster\\" Vegas thing was almost walking the edge of believability for me. These were the only two things that kept me from completely sinking into the story. They did not ruin my pure enjoyment of reading it.<br /><br />  Exciting, passionate, and well written, Beautiful Disaster was exactly what I hoped it would be when I read the description and decided to buy it. For those who enjoy this genre, I would consider this a must read!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|love this series, wonderful pricing for it being a set of four. can't wait to buy the fifth book for my kindle
0060574216|5.0|This book was bought for a present. The book was in excellent condition. I am very satisfied with my purchase.

B004UID2LC|4.0|The app is really cool because not only do u listen to ur fav songs but u get to download dem fo FREE!! It never caused trouble on my kindle fire hd n works fine...<br />I personally love it and couldn't ask for a better app like diss one :)!!
0316044695|5.0|This story reads like a summer blockbuster action flick. The training Luttrell describes at BUDs shows you why he was able to survive such a vicious ambush. Awesome read.

B00CATSONE|4.0|Another time when history relegates real genius to a back shadow and promotes those with political power to the stage.  Tesla has never really been celebrated for his genius as the more popular personages are celebrated.
B002ZG997C|5.0|i like end of days type movies...<br /><br />this has it all with a twist at the end...<br /><br />heard it was good and its better...have watched twice<br />and will again soon!

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have had android phones pretty much since they came out and I can honestly say  this is the only app I have ever purchased. Once the Flow came out, I will never use another keyboard!
B005USZYDU|3.0|Pretty good, but I was disappointed in the ending. A little far fetched on what a boy of his age could really know in the law. Grisham has written better books!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Can't say enough about The Piano Guys! They are genius music makers! What a treat for my eyes and ears.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a well laid out sim game!! It has mini games and a fun story line.  I can agree comlletely that time flys by while playing!  Works great on my kindle fire and I really enjoy the music!
B00847KFDS|5.0|I love every song on this album!  Interesting combination of friends singing with with him.  I highly recommend this album!
B00C70FH7M|5.0|Altered State is the second album from progressive rockers Tesseract and it is simply one of the best albums ever made in this style of music. The band delivers a deep dark album full of intense musical performances from all band members while simultaneously creating some very memorable melodies and grooves that capture your ear at every turn. The album was self produced and sounds amazing with lots of great layering of parts and an excellent mix that allows all the many layers to breathe. The change in vocals has done no harm to their sound and the absence of screams has really lifted the vibe of their music to a point where the entire set sounds unique and mysterious. It is very difficult to mention highlights in an album that seems so complete and in which the entire flow of songs feels like a musical journey but the single \\"Nocturne\\" will give you an excellent example of what this album delivers. From syncopated grooves to soaring melodies and soft interludes, Altered State delivers a very satisfying progressive metal hit. Words will never do justice to an album of such high quality so I suggest you listen and hear for yourself. Altered State is essential listening for fans of Tesseract and Karnivool and will definitely go down as one of the best albums in this style of music. By the way, Tesseract will be supporting Karnivool on their UK tour at the end of the year so definitely check that out if you live nearby!
B002N14GPE|4.0|Just a fantastic story and some killer acting by Isabelle Fuhrman. I had literally no interest in seeing this movie, but over time you kind of run out of movies so I finally gave it a shot. Sooooo glad I did. This movie was a riot. I was cracking up the whole time. The little girl (Fuhrman) was absolutely amazing. Although the story has been used before, trust me, this one is completely different. It used the crazy orphan story and just twisted and twisted until they forced it to be something new. And this one really twists it. Some ridiculously memorable scenes in this black sheep tale. Look for the scenes where the orphan is playing with her fishtank and when the father starts investigating her room. Classic! Tough call on this one, but I gave it four instead of five stars. Although, I might come back and change this one after another viewing.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I got my order quickly, and it has been a great product. I would buy from them again! I drop things a lot and its saved my kindle. This is my second kindle, didn't use a case before....a must have!
B000I9U75G|1.0|WTF! This is not how I remembered Godzilla. They completely ruined the entire idea of Godzilla. There are so many things that are wrong I couldn't believe it. The plot was just absurd. They actually turn Godzilla into a hermaphrodite. Yes, it's true. Godzilla has his/her own babies. WTF, man! That is SOOOOO not Godzilla. Godzilla can also get outrun by a homeless bum on a wooden dock. Riiight! Plus the military are also apparently blind, as Godzilla dodges every fu#@ing projectile shot at him/her. The military also couldn't see this fu$#ing 500 foot monster hide in a building. Oh my god in heaven. How the fu@# do you lose a 500 foot monster. Anybody, Anybody? So in conclusion, if you have any respect for yourself or for what Godzilla was supposed to be, don't rent this at all.
B009JZSFUY|3.0|As the title reads, it's a good movie, but you really have to be a Next Gen fan to enjoy this movie. I'm sure some will disagree.<br /><br />This is the main reason I really like the newest series of movies of Trek. You don't have to really know who Kahn is to enjoy the movie. It's a good movie first, but also has ties to the series.
0307352153|3.0|I recently read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain and would like to share my thoughts with you<br />today. Being an introvert myself the subject matter interests me greatly and I had hoped by reading this book I would be able to gain some insight and understanding. I can certainly say I have gained what I set out to along with a new appreciation for introverts after reading this book.<br /><br />As far as the book itself goes, I thought that it was extremely well researched, almost too a point where it became laborious to read. There were sections halfway through that I just could get through. I ended up skipping parts of chapters 6, 7 and 8. The topics and in-depth detail being explained I felt had little relevance to what main topic of the book. A simple explanation and overview in these areas would have been plenty to make her point, but they went on and on. This is a book that I would love to get a Cliff Notes version of. I felt that the chapters 1-3 and 8-10 were the most relevant and insightful. By the time I made it to chapter 8 I was exhausted and really doubting my ability to make it to the end. But 8-10 really turned it around and offered some really incredible explanation. The conclusion notes seem like common sense, but combined with the information from the rest of the book its extremely motivating and a concise summary of the key points.<br /><br />With that being said I think that this is a necessary ready for everyone, at least chapters 1-3 and 8-10. It will help to gain a better understanding of your family, friends, children, co-workers and anyone you communicate with on a regular basis. The information provided was a welcomed explanation to so many things I've always written off as just me being weird. My entire life I've always felt like the weird kid. I just didn't quite fit in. I was different, but I didn't know growing up that I was still normal. It helped me to adjust my view not only on myself, but the rest of the world. People are people, false. The truth is that you are you, and I am me.<br />Some of the key points that really stuck with me were these:<br /><br />Open floor plan work environments: kills creativity and makes people inhibited, uneasy and uncomfortable.<br /><br />Intense passion and commitment to an activity (ie: art) leads to happiness and well-being. (I've always been immensely attracted to creating art and have always felt happiest and most calm when I was submerged in creating my art projects.)<br /><br />Over-stimulation in large groups, public events and spaces is stressful, physically & mentally exhausting for introverts. It interferes with attention span and short term memory - a  key component of speaking on the fly.<br /><br />Solitude was a word that always resonated deeply with me. Its where I am the most calm. I can relax, recharge and where I do my best thinking and work. Introverts desperately crave downtime away from social over-stimulation.<br /><br />The culture of character that occurred before the 1920's eventually shifted to a culture of personality post 1920. When this happened the occurrence of social anxiety rose greatly.<br /><br />Society tells us that we have to be super extroverts to be happy and successful. It makes us introverts feel wrong and ashamed of whom we really are.<br /><br />Its easy to lose who you are if you started changing who you were too early before you got to know yourself. Self-discovery is something you'll have to find out later in life. Cain provides simple questions to help you determine who you are and what you like called \\"core personal projects\\".<br />1. What did you like as a child?<br />2. What do you do when you procrastinate?<br />3. Who/what are you envious of?<br /><br />Introverts have a hard time projecting artificial enthusiasm or excitement.<br /><br />Public speaking is more difficult if you are not interested in the topic.<br /><br />Introverts can have different social selves to fit the situation or group they are with during that time. This explains why we can have extroverted moments then revert back to introvert mode. This was something that always confused me.<br /><br />I would like to end my review with this quote. \\"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.\\"
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love the Walking Dead! I am a huge fan and self professed zombie freak. This is such a great series I was captive at the very first episode! I own Season 1 also and am on the waiting list for 3 . I re watch all the episodes and am thoroughly entertained each time! This is a must have if you love The Walking Dead.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this app because no money (at least not yet) is required. There are too many games that say free, but require the purchase of coins to do much of anything.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is a great drama with suspense and intrigue!  National security and national politics, dirty and nasty as they are, make for a compelling story line.
6305428050|5.0|I loved this movie as a teen and I still love it now, my young teens get a kick out of it too!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I guess I just haven't played it enough to get used to it.I need a joystick, like back in the days, lol.
B000065V3H|5.0|I've loved this since I was a teen and it's still fun to watch, my teenage daughter loves it too!
B009AMANBA|5.0|The movie was presented extremely well. The acting was superior. I felt like I was in his cabinet during the war.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use this with my music player - very lightweight and has great sound. My last set lasted for 6 years.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Always has been my favorite story and songs. The delivery in the movie was well worth the wait. I'm still singing in my heart.
B008JFUP8A|3.0|although the movie was pretty good it falls short of my expectations, as did Oblivion, however I though Oblivion was slightly better.<br />It's a new type of movie where they are keeping budgets smaller with fewer actors involved and more pure CGI animation.  With Smith in the movie and a total cost of $130 million to make it most of the budget with to the programers no doubt.<br /><br />The movie was for the most part very predictable and the CGI imagery was very good.  Appeared that much of it was shot in the redwoods on the coast of california in the smith river area, very beautiful area.<br /><br />At the end it said story by Will Smith, it was a good movie as i said but just not what I was expecting.  This is smart money I would say for huge movies but screen plays are limited and harder to evolve with the lack of actors.<br /><br />As with the movie \\"Buried\\" with Ryan Reynolds, it's does a great job with what he had to work with but left many viewers expecting more, you will find the same with this movie.<br /><br />I somehow feel that big budget movies are evolving to this type of movie, not many actors and TONS of CGI.  Make the programers cut each others throats to compete.<br /><br />worth a watch though
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Since I've been a fan of John Le Carre from the beginning I thought this was a slower start but it heats up for sure.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I think this movie is good for every one inculing boys. I feel that it good for every one to see my four year old grand dauther love it and she know the story by heart and sing the song.  I just want to say thanks for getting the movie out to me as soon as you did I would use you again. Ina
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Daniel Craig has really grown on me as the new Bond.  This is another outstanding movie that delves into Bond's backstory more than ever before.  Solid writing, good action, and great acting.  This is a must see for any fan of 007.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I love this movie also it is one I watch with Larissa my grand dauther we love it and again she know it by heart. I just want to say thank for getting the movie out to me so soon. I would use you again. Ina
B005LAII08|5.0|My daughter really wanted this movie so we got it for her as a gift.  Excellent story with amazing animation.  Fun for the whole family.  Another Pixar classic.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|This CD by one of favorite members of ABBA is wonderful!  Agnetha still has a pretty amazing voice and, has a writing talent often overshadowed by Bjorn and Benny.  I'm so glad she decided to go back into the studio again to do this record!  Whether you're a fan or not,  I would highly recommend this release!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Game involves collecting resources and spending them to upgrade buildings or clear paths to the exit.  I've seen better stories in games similar to this one, however, the gameplay is more challenging than others.  Simply clicking quickly as soon as you can will not work as well as planning your route ahead of time.  Other gameplay elements such as puzzles and clicking on storms and bats to clear them as they appear give this game a leg up on its competition.
B002RI9ORI|5.0|It makes for a good laugh - the facts are presented in a very humorous way. It is great for anyone wanting to sieve fact from fiction in the health, wellness, and journalism fields. I would recomend it to anyone interested in these fields. The author has really done his research which makes it a credible read.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I stopped watching Nicholas sparks movies because they were getting too cheesy. But this one is a great story of love, hope, and family. It's way better than I was expecting.
B001XVS2LO|5.0|Not sure how long it was in the movies but this is a great movie! Lots of action and well known GOOD LOOKING actors!
B009YU62H2|5.0|Wow. This album is lots of fun to listen to. It's been 16 long years since Soundgarden put out a cd/album. They haven't missed a beat (figuratively or literally). It's almost as if they've been together during this huge gap, writing and playing. Fans will not be disappointed. Long live the Seattle sound!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My son and I are hooked on Walking Dead. The actors and actresses are compatible and make you care about what happens to them. The writers are great and each episode is written to keep you hooked.
0486219577|4.0|This book came in excellent condition as it was described. It was a wonderful source of ideas and examples that I could use when tooling leather bracelets and belts.
B0086700CM|2.0|This is not very good graphics and is really easy .I wouldn't buy this again I don't recommend it, instead I would recommend temple run two and not brave that one doesn't work well.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love love love this game. Almost as much as I loved the movie all those years ago. Something about Nemo and Dory,that is so sweet and adorable.<br />Game is easy to understand,and a great way to pass time.
076115678X|4.0|Fun for adolescent and teenage girls to read and try the tricks - makes a cute addendum present for a girl with wavy or curly hair
B005USZYDU|4.0|Cute and from a kid's perspective. Enjoyed it! I'd recommend that others need to read it. Entertaining.  John Grisham is definitely good.
B009P1WES6|4.0|An attractive young woman is abducted on the streets of Paris.  A witness sees her being bundled into an anonymous white van, but no one knows who she is or where she has been taken.  Camille Verhoeven (a male detective) is assigned the case, despite disturbing parallels in the abduction of his wife several years earlier.  Gradually, through extensive police work, the detectives close in on the case and uncover the motivations of the kidnapper.  In alternative chapters, we are shown what Alex, the kidnap victim, is going through - trapped and left to die in a small cage in a remote location.<br /><br />This is a fast paced thriller which is broken into three distinct parts.  The plot is cleverly constructed.  Each part leads the reader to totally re-evaluate everything that they've read until now and to see the characters in quite different lights to how they were presented earlier.  There are some very clever twists along the way.  It all adds up to one of the more original and absorbing thrillers that I've read in some time.<br /><br />The book was originally written in French and is the middle book in a trilogy (although a fourth book is apparently now planned), but is the first to be translated into english.  Although there is the occasional clunky sentence, for the most part you don't notice it, which I think is the mark of a good translation.
B0026772N8|3.0|Difficult read, but it has improved my DIY habits, which is no mean achievement. Sometimes the difficult reads leave with you more. This is the case here, but you have to work hard for it.
B0097RU0SE|5.0|If you are a Saxon fan, don't hesitate to buy this video. A lot of contents and the interviews with the band members are very interesting.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This dictionary version will only let me get to the words by scrolling through the entire alphabet. I am going to remove it from my kindle and the cloud as useless......
B004SCRDCY|5.0|NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SEE THIS MOVIE, READING THIS BOOK TOPS IT.  WELL WRITTEN, RIVETING, TRULY AN AMERICAN CLASSIC.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|As would be expected, his album is great!  As a true fan, he produces beautiful music.  So relaxing to listen to him.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|This series is fantastic and Patrick Stewart really carries it.  Some of the best acting comes from his character portrayal.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The cable solved all of my problems regarding recharging my Kindle.  However, do NOT believe Amazon when they say &#34;order within 5 hours for next day delivery&#34;.  That is exactly what I did because I needed the cable within 3 days as I was going on a trip; however,  I didn't receive the cable until a week later when I got back.  The product is excellent; the advertising leaves alot to be desired.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I've never read a book so fast. Thoroughly entertaining. This book is less about baseball and more about the human psyche.
B005P1YCNK|1.0|Small changes can make a big difference. Hardy lays it out in powerful, yet easy to understand detail. No matter what you do for a living, read this book to find out how to do it better!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An amazing life story. A delightful piece of inspiration. There is no flattering, only the way he was. Best lesson &#34;Focus&#34;. Second best lesson, diplomacy is not necessary when you are focused and build your life based on the &#34;true&#34; (meaning of true: information that make things happen. If it doesn't happen then it is not true)
B006LSZECO|4.0|It keeps your interest.  Never know what is going to happen next.  Not quite finished but can't wait for the ending.
B0041D843M|5.0|Did not know there are so many peer reviewed studies that show a negative link between animal food and health. Also we have to rethink the scientific community.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Pretty sweet app.  It works better than I expected it to do.  Some of tge sound options like tge different rains sound too similar and I wish there were more preset mixes with the binurals.  You can save mixes you make to favorites so ill just have to create my own.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was a recommendation from one of my students. I have no regrets purchasing this movie. It's quite funny!
B000000XB9|5.0|This CD is a great CD if you dont have any CCR albums in your collection, the sound quality was amazing on the CD.
B005LAIIQC|1.0|the movie skips, and can't watch the whole and it skips in more than one area of the movie. To hard to watch
0679805273|5.0|Great story and inspiration for grads! My son received this book 12 years ago for his high school graduation.  It has been my all time favorite gift in addition to money.
B00632HWOG|1.0|since the last upgrade, deleted messages from inbox does not move to trash. these messages keep reappearing in my inbox, regardless how many times I click on the messages to be moved to trash. waste of time!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I like this book. I also read the bigger one that came out earlier.<br /><br />Taubes made the point that few books about obesity show pictures of obese people. I would like to make the point that even fewer mention feces, urine and gas. Yes, these by-products of the digestive system do contain a lot more than the 20 calories that Taubes used to illustrate what a difference that would make over time. I could find no mention of human waste in his book.<br /><br />The fact is that not all food is digested. Around 6% of the energy that passes the system leaves in stools and 4% in urine and 0.5% in farts.<br /><br />http://nutrition.highwire.org/content/140/3/469/T2.expansion.html<br /><br />A slight change in the thermodynamic efficiency of the digestive system will have large effects over time on the weight of the individual. Some people envisage using raw sewage as a source of energy for electric production:<br /><br />http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/cash2/<br /><br />Sorry Gary, but thermodynamics do matter.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I liked this for the first few uses though always had trouble putting my iPhone with battery. The legs finally fell off and fear breaking my iPhone if I use this again.
0061537969|5.0|To whom it may concern,<br /><br />  I enjoy reading this book very much.It made me feel like that is my dog. Enzo is such a great dog . The story made me feel like I know him.<br /><br />Great book,<br />Kanya<br />,
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Outstanding sound -- outstanding quality. The serenity and the quiet elevating dynamics of this music make it an almost &#34; Zen fully spiritual  experience&#34; that can be experienced to the fullest  holding hands with your significant other ( or alone) while sipping coffee or wine. The range of this album to satisfy is outstanding. It is a keeper.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a good wait to buy and a good thing good game you can fly two and seats are endless supply chain
B007MAETA8|5.0|Bought this 2 weeks before his concert here in town. Being only a far weather fan was worried i would not like it.<br /><br />I was wrong. Love Love Love the cd. Great songs and lyrics that work even for someone as old as me. Buy it
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Multiplayer is the best part of the game.  very fun for up to four people. this is a great game
B002M9WW30|5.0|What else is there to say. First one is one of the greatest story telling movies ever. &#34;I shoulda broke your thumb!&#34;
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|Finally, I found some banana plugs that have good quality, that don't break the bank.<br />I used 14 gauge speaker wire with these and they connect just fine. Some reviewers here made the comment that they had to remove the colored rings in order to get a &#34;snug&#34; connection. I did not - but I did have to be very careful when inserting and &#34;fraying&#34; the wire so that there wound be sufficient copper material in order to screw tightly enough. I would imagine the thicker the gauge, the easier this would be. I'm not sure I would recommend these with anything lighter than 14 gauge, for this reason.<br />As I said, the plugs are good quality and do the job just fine.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a game all my kids agree on.  Even my 5 year old can play.  They love having a pet dragon.
B0035RFYT2|5.0|I actually ordered this to use as part of a cake topper for my daughter's 8th birthday. She wants a \\"Twilight\\" themed cake so I added this along with the action figures. She also loves animals so this is a plus. The detail on the wolf is nice. The only thing is, like with all small animal figures, the legs on them may be able to handle some rough play but can still get broken considering they are the thinnest part on the figure. So, I wouldn't recommend them for very young children . Nonetheless, I know my 8 year old will have fun with all the toppers I plan to use.
B003H6KRIE|3.0|The first movie was great. Great action sequences, a little romance, and a decent storyline. The powers that be wanted more action and less storyline for this movie, but director Doug Liman and Matt Damon both refused - and the results were fantastic. The next two movies saw a new director - much to the detriment of the series. The excessive camera shake was, well, just plain stupid, and gave me a massive headache just watching them. So an A+ for the first movie, and two c-'s for the next two.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|it is so much fun u do all of these crazy thing to their hair. u can also make them look really weird its so much fun
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Movie was great. One I will watch over and over again. Thanks to Tom for making such a great actor for this role.
0802473156|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a psychologist who does couple therapy.  After reading it, I started applying the principals to my relationship, and found that it's made a great relationship even better!  I've also discovered what MY language is, and shared the knowledge with my partner, so now I'm getting more love as well.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My son loves this movie and it's fun for our entire family to watch. It's not rude or inappropriate like many movies can be and it has a great theme behind it.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|The acting was excellent!  The pacing and tension were loose.  There was too much exposition and no surprises.  This is a movie in which top-notch actors did their best with a &#34;B&#34; movie.
B00CWM3F4C|2.0|Wow was I looking forward to this album.  With the addition of DuVall we wondered what we were gonna get, but, amazingly Black Gives Way to Blue was triumphant. Was it any surprise that Cantrell (who I consider a national treasure) found a way to create a new sound while maintaining the guts of AIC and incorporate DuVall's considerable talent? Saw them live following the release of BGWTB and it was sweet! Well then comes along TDPDH. What the hell happened? I am sorry I did not get the CD/Rip version and only the download cause I need to know who wrote these tunes.  I suspect many were written by DuVall (BTW, all of BGWTB was written by Cantrell). Yeah, DuVall has a lot of talent and he could do the Staley harmonies and \\"dissident voice bend,\\" but I always wondered if he would get tired of that and want to show his own identity.  It is only natural. As I said, I do not know who wrote these songs but they sound like DuVall's interest in a more soaring, straightforward and vanilla type of rock music and vocals. Frankly, I would not be surprised if Cantrell let DuVall run with it. After all, AIC is THE absolute original, mammoth, monster-riff, haunting-vocal force of nature.  Cantrell has nothing to prove and many legendary artists will step back and let new band members take the reigns for a while.  Miles Davis did this routinely. I am virtually certain that besides Hollow, if one heard any of these songs anonymously, one would not guess they were AIC. So many elements of AIC are simply absent, completely. But just take one, the amazing orignal vocal harmonies that are about 40% of AIC's greatness -- simply not there, not even close, nada.  Just DuVall, rocking away singing very proficiently, but, not interesting, blah. BTW, I have listened to this about 10 times through.  It does not grow on me because it is simply uninteresting. Jerry, no disrespect intended you are one of the quintessential rock artists of the last 25 years. I recommend that one spend there $ on The Essential Alice in Chains and luxuriate in some of the most intriguing, exciting, haunting, powerful music ever assembled.  If you enjoy rocking from side to side when YOU are ready to rock, Dinosaur is your baby.
B004US4K2C|3.0|I was hoping to find a launcher/editor for tablet walls.  Most out there are still geared toward mobile android phones.  I have an android tablet so unfortunately their editor will only allow you to create according to mobile phone screen size.  It looks rather tiny on a tablet.  I sill like some of their design options to set walls, not icons.  When they update their editor to include tablet screen sizes, then I might update this review with something better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! its so fun! I would recommend it to anyone. if your reading this you should get this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is ANYTHING BUT BAD its so fun i know every age group can do this app.tbis app is fun<br />JUMP, CALP, GO OVER THAT TRAIN TRACK is what i say thats my ppem but i suggest getting this app the best thing about it is that every month it changes that backround or theme.every theme you can get a new charcter like in maay the theme was \\"tokyo japan\\" so thats fun and if you connect with facebook then you can try to beat you friend or family score!
B000A7DVRC|5.0|Before viewing this film, I'd have denied being a Coen Brothers fan.  This film changed my view.  I learned about it after reading, &#34;The Dude and The Zen Master&#34; which piqued my interest in seeing the film that this book revolves around.  I'm going to explore other Coen Brothers offerings as well as other films starring Jeff Bridges.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I was introduced to Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog by some Browncoat friends, and their description didn't seem too interesting. Boy was I wrong! The is among the very best entertainment I've seen in a quite a while. The songs are wonderful and very catchy, and I frequently find myself humming them. Even though it's only ~45 minutes in length, by the end you will be emotionally invested in each of the characters.<br /><br />To quote another reviewer, it's &#34;wonderfully horrible!&#34;
B00B7VPKMY|4.0|This is a very affordable box set of the Eagles studio albums. It is bare bones, no extras. Packaging is all paper, no booklets, or other special inclusions like the more expensive box set w/plastic cd holders includes. If you're someone that likes to read the liner notes and credits, this is not for you. Although each disc comes in a thin cardboard &#34;album&#34; sleeve. No liner notes are included and the first 4 discs have different artwork on the cd itself than if you bought the original disc seperately. Probably due to contractual issues or something. Other than that, this is all the Eagles studio albums and it is affordable!
1932100660|5.0|This book should be required reading in every school and every household. Dr. Campbell's work is both scientific and common sense. I have been a vegetarian for a few years and typically do a lot of independent research and reading before I trust anyone's recommendation on anything- particularly food and nutrition. I am now considering a Vegan lifestyle, not only for better health, but also for the sake of global welfare and economy.  Thank you Dr. Campbell  for enlightening us to save ourselves and our planet.
B00000AF98|4.0|I must say that my feeling about \\"Crazy Nights\\" is more positive than negative. However when I was listening to this stuff for the first time it did not catch my attention at all. I needed to spend more time on playing this disk to realize that this CD is not worse than: \\"Animalize\\", \\"Asylum\\" and \\"Hot in the shade\\". Moreover \\"Crazy Nights\\" contains several great hits. In my opinion it is actually even more \\"pop rock\\" than \\"real heavy metal rock\\" CD by KISS. It does not bring us as tough and heavy material as those three CDs which I have already mentioned. The music that can be heard from certain songs of \\"Crazy Nights\\" can be regarded as similar to the sound of pop music played by many hugely popular bands such as Asia, Rainbow, Journey or even Whitesnake. Hetherto, the proper examples could be: \\"I'll fight hell to hold you\\", \\"My way\\", \\"Reason to live\\", \\"Turn on the night\\". I guess KISS might have reached new fans of pop music recording these hits. Fortunetely, we may encounter also harder songs on this album. To sum up, this album really rocks. Those who are fond of heavy metal should be fancy with such tracks as: \\"Bang, bang you\\"; \\"No, no, no\\"; \\"When your walls come down\\"; \\"Hell or high water\\"; \\"Thief in the night\\", \\"Crazy crazy nights\\". There is no doubt that the best song of the whole CD is the ninth one entitled: \\"Good girl gone bad\\". Certainly, it is only my opinion.
1452115567|5.0|An amazing book and an amazing story. Fantastic photographs and an adorable pooch!!! Great gift or just for yourself. You can't have a bad day with this book around!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What an amazing novel.  This story covers every inch of the emotional spectrum.  You are mad at the narrator at times, empathetic at times, fearful at times and constantly engaged with him throughout.  This is a very difficult story, at times, being a parent myself.  I found myself constantly wondering what I would do or how I would feel in this situation.  It was one of those books I had to sit there and just process quietly for awhile right after I finished it.  Haunting.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The book just ties up the loose ends the previous books left. Nothing really exciting! It's the right decision the author ending this series.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is pretty cool. Whenever I'm bored I go too this game for excitement and to make the time pass by.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|This delightful Disney film is soooo adorable.<br />The Special Edition comes with DVD games and extras<br />that will be a lot of fun.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Perfect! May need to do some real close measuring to be sure it fits in the case. Had to buy one, this thing is huge, but performs well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have enjoyed this game very much on my cross country road trip. I would definitely recommend it to others.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is one of the best games I have got on my phone ever. I was really getting bored with my phone until I got this the other day for free. Would gladly pay for it though. Seriously worth the money, it's always a crap shoot punching apps.<br /><br />I will just put it this way. My wife is not happy about it.
0061122416|5.0|I haven't read the book yet, but watched a personal growth video featuring Will Smith, who said he loved the book. Fast shipping and great price!
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|the best album I've heard in years...great work Tom Keifer...I hope you come again to perform in Grand Rapids, MI
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Haha, it was worth reading, but being that it is about a woman with severe short and long term amnesia...it's a little redundant.  I found myself a little bored.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|This was a gift for my husband who is a real Knopfler fan. Like all the other Knopfler CDs, he loved this one, and so did I.
B00821OUT6|5.0|Sometimes shows start slow.  The first season was ok.  Tolerable.  But season 2 really upgraded the show.  It is now a \\"must see\\" for me.  Good story, good effects, good characters.  Recommended.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Thank you! i love this show a lot and i needed this season to complete my set.  I cant wait to see it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is simple but very addictive.  Great for road trips.  My kids love to play.  A must have game.  See for yourself
B00CHILW64|4.0|Nicely portrayed story of the tsunami and the miraculous survival of one family Special effects at the beginning made it worth the whole movie  A few poor misjudgments  by a grief stricken father that made you a little aggravated Overall a good watch although it slows down a lot in the middle It's worth hanging in there I think
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book gets across exactly what's goes through some people's mind when they are suicidal. For myself, I didn't want to end my life as much as I wanted people to feel remorse for their actions. And know exactly what it was they did to make me feel that way. I love it
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He loved it and turns out I did too. Definitely great listening on a winter's night.
B002UWH8SS|1.0|I should just keep my mouth shut.  But could not tolerate this show at all.  Lame.  They just recycled the Stargate saga, but out came trash.  I love the Stargate stuff, but this was just lame lame lame.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|And so do many others.<br /><br />It is too bad for this game too, per it is a very well done, quick style game.  However, everything is based on you gathering coins with only the first stage available for free.  To get to upgrades of your vehicle or get to stage two, you need coins.  Well, you could play stage one 50+ times to get enough to upgrade your car and get enough for stage two, or you could just hit the BUY COINS with the big button in the center of the screen between stages to uses your real money to buy the game coins.
193700788X|3.0|Most of us didn't get the ending that we wanted......but I'm glad that Harris was finally wrapping things up. The series was great for quite awhile, but after book 11 or whatever, it went severely downhill. Of course I had to finish the series because I was invested so much time into it.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Well done movie about two confused and...well yes crazy souls who manage to make a go of life once they can forge a bond of trust big enough to get them through Robert Deniro was his usual great self Supporting cast was great You may just find yourself liking this nutty funny touching film
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|When will the third season be released and shipped so that I can watch it?! The 4th season is coming to TV in October.
B004AYCWZI|5.0|Read \\"Journey\\" in one sitting.  Couldn't put it down:  Vivid writing. Engaging characters; Interesting plot; Lots to learn.  What more can you ask?
B00BY8DNK6|1.0|wow !! who the Heck mastered these cd's ? it clips all over the place due to it being WAY too loud in the mastering , the Guitar is lost throughout most of it ...and who did the original Mix ? the snare drum is louder that Ronnie !  this gig is just ruined , Hopefully the dvd & Blu-ray are much better ?
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was full of suspense and twists I had a hard time putting it down! I don't have anything incredibly intelligent to say in my critique of this book because its not exactly a &#34;literary masterpiece&#34; but it was a lot like 48 hour mystery or a Lifetime Network movie you can't help but get sucked in. Read it.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|I bought this for my wife for her birthday. The story line is alright. In all honestly if you get this just rent it instead of purchasing it unless you find this in the $5 dollar bin.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|A well done movie about how drugs & alcohol will rob you of any kind of life as you know it A bit slow..it drags in the middle but overall a well done movie Special effects first 30 minutes were excellent
B004LWZWBU|1.0|What movie did people who gave this 5 stars watch? I was very depressed after wasting 1.5 hours of my life watching it - 1.5 hours I can never get back!  It was AWFUL.  Acting was lame, plot line predictable, phonybaloney robot birds, sappy, not ONE funny line, I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters.  I love Steve Martin but he had nothing to offer in this film.  It should have been called The Bad Year that lasted waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really got this for my daughter and she loved the first version so I got the second one for her to play.  She loves it!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Captivating and intriguing!  You are easily sucked into the mystery. Looking forward to the next piece of the story. Very much worthy of couple of dollars.
B004I654WQ|5.0|Exactly what my son wanted, he is a huge cars fan like many other kids and watches the movie a lot.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|If you love to sing I highly recommend this movie! The cast is pretty good! Fat Amy is hilarious! The have some pretty good song selections they use in this movie.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Incredibly insightful movie of what went on behind the scenes..the lead was played perfectly by Jessica Chastain A real hero As usual hats off to our brave soldiers who are working against the odds to help the poor souls over there
B0063IH60K|1.0|Every time I start a new game, I am forced to see an ad, which will require me to back out of the screen and get back in...
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have wanted to read this but not purchase the paper version so I found this on here and it was free!!!  AWESOME!!!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|As always this Reache book was a don't put me down. Each book reveals a little more of what makes Reacher who he is. Perfect descriptive visuals od NY Subway at 2Am. Again another outstanding Lee CHild, reacher book
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you liked Season one and two of Downton Abbey you will Love this group of stories and will leave you wanting more as we watch the friends , Family and great Servants of Downton Abbey at the start of the Roaring Twenties in 1920, Great Fun and this is a 5-Star movie and this is a 5-Star Seller, as All of the companies I deal with through Amazon .Com- the Best!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|From the very start of the movie the action grabs you. A wonderful story told about the greatest generation in WWII.
B005F3XV62|5.0|Great book good for quick review and it is also good for a reference and future use. will keep and will be part of my use in future. I like to read and read again
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many beautiful pictures and inspirational ideas! The Pinterest app is great time saver...just click and go right to site!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have wanted to read this but not purchase the paper version so I found this on here and it was free!!!  AWESOME!!!
B007UR1OHO|5.0|Trust me you will enjoy this movie if your not a guy. The vow turned into one of my favorite movies!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|This is exactly what I needed to get the job done.  Quality is great and does exactly what I needed it to do.  Will order more products like this as I need them.
B008Y5OWSO|3.0|It was just OK for me. I was expecting an epic western and what I got was a long drawn out movie on immigrants.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I owned the regular bluray version, and loved it. But I knew there had to be even more features. I traded up to the 4 disc version, and BLAMMO! So much cool stuff! Best full feature DVD I have ever owned!
B00006AW2L|5.0|This is Classic Rolling Stones. It has a great variety of hits on it and some not heard on the radio
B000JML90Y|5.0|I really only got this because I teach science and I need to keep up with what the origins of evolution are
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Season 8's episodes are more like the quality of seasons 3, 4 & 5- the best in my opinion!<br />The guys are back supporting one another in there own Winchester way.<br />Loved the season finale- though I would have liked to have seen the gates of hell closed!
B0074MZSWW|4.0|It is a good CD, not great.  But perfect to listen to at work or making a road trip somewhere.
0812993845|5.0|Bought this book as part of my Mothers Day gift for my wife. She has other books from the same author and she raves about how she loves them. She's finished the book and she told me that she loved the story and that is all I need to know. Glad she loved it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great real time rpg like game.  Good graphics and game play. No slow down. Love this game.  I would recommend to anyone as long as you have wi fi
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It's fun to watch Downton Abbey on T.V., but much more satisfying to watch as many episodes as I want all at once.  Caution to those with addictive personalities--you will be utterly hooked!!  Be prepared to let other activities wait for another day!
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I again got this game as a free app of the day and really got it for my nephews to play.  They actually enjoy playing it and have fun with it
B009GX6SSK|4.0|Love this show. The character development was so great this season.<br />However, I felt some of the action was formulaic this season- unlike the first 3.<br />That is my only criticism.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|It was ok, defiantly my least favorite in the series so far.  I think it would have been better off if he just told half the story for all the characters instead of telling all the story for half the characters.  This one was slow to develop.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun to play, especially with little ones, but can run slow and sometime freezes. it would be ideal if there was a way to play only with your family....limited access of sorts.
1401201911|5.0|This is the cream of the crop for a superman story. Be it that it's an else worlds kind of story (not cannon), it is still probably the best superman book I've ever read, hell, one of the best graphic novels I've ever read. I strongly recommend this book to any comic book fan even if DC isn't their favorite. You won't be let down. They even throw in some of the other well known DC characters to add more flavor to the story. This is one of Mark Miller's best stories you'll find. Buy it!!!!
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Its the BOSS.  Brought back memories and reminded me of how great a singer - performer she is.  Watched it over and over again.  Happy I own the DVD now I can watch whenever I need to hear that voice.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I got this as a free app of the day.  I purchased it because I was going to back up my phone to my computer and have not done it yet.  However all the reviews and the description were true to what it does
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House came recommended to me by a retired English teacher - and from here on out, I will only be taking her book recommendations!  I was mesmerized by the characters throughout the entire novel.  I haven't been as committed to the well-being and emotional tribulations of fictional book characters like this in quite some time.  These characters trials and tribulations became very real to me, and their experiences came alive on the page.  I could barely put it down, and gobbled up the novel in less than 2 days!  Grissom is an epic story teller with a unique capability to make her characters so wonderfully human and genuine.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|I like Mark Wahlberg and he plays an ex - sniper that has been off the grid for some time. It's a good role for him as he looks the part. The trouble starts when the US Government find him to supposedly help them with a potential assassination attempt.<br />The movie takes a turn quickly and before you know it Wahlberg character is now on the run. I don't want to reveal too much, but it's action packed and overall pretty entertaining.<br />Guy's film for sure. Blood, guts, and feathers type flick..
1934030597|5.0|Great resource....covers everything you could possibly need and gives a few laughs along the way....and the cover is grease resistant...
B0014VQGX4|5.0|I bought this toy for my 3 year old boy to play with in the sandbox. He loves that all the parts work and move like the real thing. He plays with it almost every day and nothing has broken in the couple months that we have had it. It does not rust and the paint has not faded in our Texas sun. A wonderful purchase!
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Based on a true occurrence, Follett weaves a tale about how an Israeli James Bond absconded with tons of yellow cake uranium in order to enable Israel to enter the nuclear age.  There is the predictable love interest and betrayal of old school chums.  A ver quick and compelling read.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I have wanted to read this but not purchase the paper version so I found this on here and it was free!!!  AWESOME!!!
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|This is a very touching story of friendship and scholarship.  It is about recognizing your potential and living up to it, and the discovery that it is never too late to do so.  I have viewed this movie with groups of students several times. There is quite a bit of foul language that I warn them about before viewing, but the overall message is well worth it. It is best suited for high school groups.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This is the Saturday Night Live version of the tales of North Korea. Underneath the satire is sadness. An entire nation broken to its knees by one despot and his family.  Not merely a delusion, but a nightmare.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It's really interesting and keeps you playing. I couldn't stop. I wanted read but I was really curious on where this game would lead.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I wish that there was more buildings, and didn't have many buildings that costs cash, they should have been In coins. There should also have more crops to grow, and more land expansions, and more decorations that don't cost cash and have reasonable profits. The game was fun and I didn't run into any glitches. Now, because of The Oregon Trail I usually trust game loft  games.
B000067QMD|5.0|I read a lot of reviews about how the natural bottles leak.  But one review gave the tip of using this with the Philip Avent classic bottle screw rings.  We haven't used them yet with the natural bottles as the baby won't be here till July, but I tried one one with a bottle ring on a Philip Avent natural bottle and it honestly felt like it all came together with a snap and was extremely secure.  Don't think we will be getting any leaks!  I will probably test these out by putting some water in the bottle along with using the screw rings and sealing discs to see if it leaks.    Update (February 2016): I'm on baby #2 now and using these again with the classic screw rings and natural bottles. I have never haf one leak the entire time I used it for baby #1 and now baby #2.  Really great product.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This is one of my favorite games when there is not room for other things.  I highly recommend this for kids in the car on a trip
B007PFD90G|4.0|Wish I could give it 4.5 stars. SR is an interesting fellow who has lead a very interesting life. I was surprised at how frank SR expressed his opinions of some of the women he was involved with ... But it worked out to the readers advantage. Highly recommended for biography lovers.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|not too complicated, but requires just enough strategy not to be monotonous. possible to progress without spending money, but not if you want to unlock all options.
0425263916|5.0|Have loaned this to two other people after I finished.  I can hardly wait until the next one is out!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I found this game fun and exiting but there should be more buildings. I think that there should be Apartment buildings, supermarkets, business buildings and other buildings. VI enjoyed Virtual city playground, but didn't like Virtual city,or Virtual city 2. I think that Virtual city playground was better than the others because you can actually build your own city
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey does it again! LOVED season 2. If you enjoyed the first season, you will NOT be disappointed. Enjoy!
B007MCTTHY|5.0|It really like this reference for science.  It has helped when I need to look something up quickly and do not have a textbook.  great job
0143034901|5.0|I am a pretty hard core reader, average about 75 books a year. The Shadow of the Wind is my favorite book of all time.  CRZ is a special author. I loved this series so much I purchased both the electronic versions and hardbacks for my library.
B000002OX7|5.0|This CD is all I expected & more! I play it in my Cadillac on it's Bose sound system. OMG! If you can stay still while listening to this; well...you might be dead. FANYASTIC JAMS!!!
0765325950|2.0|After more than 20 friggin years of following this story, we get some lame ending where Rand goes walking off into the sunset with  Moridin's face.... Leaves me to wonder who came up with this \\"grand finale\\" totally unimpressive IMHO.<br />I want to know what happened to:<br />Perrin and Faile<br />Matt and his bloody hat<br />Tuon and Artur Hawkwing<br />Elayne and the babes<br />Aviendha<br />Tam and the Two Rivers boys<br />Moraine and her gleeman<br />The White Tower and Logaine<br />Loial and his folk<br />LAN and Nynaeve<br />And just who are the Sharans? They just appear for the first time and become the center of the battle...<br />I'll never read another 14 book series again, unfortunately it looks like JRR Martins  series is going the same way.<br />Hopefully now that this is over Sanderson can concentrate his efforts on \\"The Way of Kings\\" which has the potential to be a great series!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A pleasure for the eyes and mind! My 11 year old daughter recommended it and I heartedly concur. Great Pick!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Why won't it open on kindle fire? It just keeps saying error during sign in! Not happy :-( anyone know what I need to do?
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was hard to read not a lot of action did 't keep me interested, I finished the book just to hopefully get a great ending.
1938469011|4.0|An impressive amount of information written in a very digestible manner.  Within a field that is constantly evolving, the author has done an exceptional job of making sense of the current state of the art, without writing a book that will be dated anytime soon.  From  conceptual to practical, from seed to finished beer, Hieronymus covers has it covered.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|The movie is based on the book of the same name by Jonathan Safran Foer which I have yet to read. The author adopts the conceit that this is an autobiographical tale in which he returns to the Odessa Region of the Ukraine to seek for information about his roots. Everything about this tale is eccentric. The stilted language derives from the author's own Yiddish Roots and the ideas about English supplied by his Russian Interpreter Alex--a tall awkward lad Jonathan's age. His driver, Alex' Grandfather, is blind employing a \\"seeing-eye\\" bitch, a small dog with attitude that ends up sharing the back seat with Jonathan and later his bed. Jonathan is a 'collector' who saves baggies of dirt,  even that supplied him for his gamma's grave, her false teeth, photographs, a broach containing a grasshopper in amber, all of it pinned to the wall of his bedroom. The old two-cycle Russian Car they drive with a tour guide sign up top totters along always on the verge of failure but it somehow manages to negotiate superhighways, dirt roads, and paths with the grass growing between the ruts. At one point a young goatherd sticks a small pebble in the valve-stem of the back tire flattening it. There is disbelief all round when their guest announces he is vegetarian--what, no sausage?<br /><br />This is one in any number of tales related by second and third generation American Jews seeking out their roots in communities purged of their ancestors by the Nazi Holocaust. What most find is either antagonism or guilt for the past amongst those that remain. If you like this movie may I recommend Shem, an independent film with a similar theme that got a cool reception in Art House Circles.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Fantastic book! Couldn't stop reading. Leaves you aching for more! I do not regret purchasing this book. I love it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its freaking fun but you need to give it a chance in the begining and I got my family addictied
1432794426|5.0|if a shocking event like the death of Michael Jackson, that was judged and violated and psycologically raped for all his life, can push a person like Dr. Moriarty that is a teacher, counselor, administrator, and consultant in public schools and as a licensed clinical psychologist at the research the truth with all herself and with all her energies, maybe it means that Michael Jackson was not the \\"freak\\" that many people thought, but an extraordinary artist and a person with an aurea so strong and magnetic to attract to him many different people..also after his death.<br />Until there will be people that will be attracted from him, from his incredible life, from his talent and from his personality that will do everything possible to give him justice and make know to the world  as the real beautiful person he was, his legend will never die and his presence here on this earth will be always bright.<br />Thanks to the author for this work.<br />Siska
1938469003|5.0|Who better to take you through the history of the style, wide ranging techniques, and a boatload of recipes drawn from an impressive variety of styles within the IPA universe.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This one is fun I love the monkey helper. I like hidden object games and this one is right at the top.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Every National album has been full of good songs with great songs sprinkled in. It would always take a couple of listens to get used to each album and appreciate them. Not so with &#34;trouble will find me&#34;. This band is so sneaky good usually you have to listen to the words, rhythm, and overall production to get that &#34;whoa that sounds awesome moment&#34; but this album is so full of them i had to write this review. If your looking for new music buy this album!!!
B0058P7KUA|3.0|This is what happened. I was playing a level and all of a sudden it exited out for no reason. Wth. This game is so fun and I hope my problem stops.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Couldn't ask for a better calendar! Love it. And for a nominal cost you can purchase icons to associate with scheduled events. Highly recommend this calendar. You won't be disappointed.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I never cared much about history when I was younger. But since I've started reading Ken Follett, I feel like I have learned more because it is so interesting. He weaves personal, heartfelt stories into real events. I wish history lessons in school would have been like this. This book was a page turner.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|got this for my 8 year old and it's great! lots of choices keeps her busy for car rides. I admit I play it too!
B00008G7UJ|5.0|One of the best renditions of this famous archetypical play ever filmed. This movie is a commentary on youth culture in 20th and 21st century today.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I bought this as a mothers day present for my mom she saw The Phantom of the Opera years ago when it was first on Broadway. Growing up she had the soundtrack and I grew up listening to Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. So to watch this years later with my mom was great fun ☆☆☆☆☆ 5 stars
140053271X|5.0|Good reader for the price. Arrived quickly with no shipping cost, love Amazon.com! My daughter ordered this and loves it, easy for a 12 year old to use.
B008JFLWLE|3.0|I downloaded this app so a coworker and I could see how it works. I think it's a pretty good app, but I have not worked with it since, so I'm not yet familiar with its capabilities.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|Maybe I don't get out enough but Altered State strikes me as major turning point in the rock/metal scene. It's grandiose but taut; complex yet melodic; ground-breaking and yet familiar. It is, quite simply, a sensation and should be heard to be believed because it's a real treat. I'll refrain from analogizing, and just hope you listen to Altered State without any preconceptions; it's one of the most rewarding listens from one of the freshest bands to emerge in decades.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|I really recommend this movie is like watching the old VHS version but as an animated cartoon.<br />Nice DVD to have in your movie library.
B009R659L8|5.0|Yep she has done it again  She keeps your interest from the beginning to the end. She keep the suspense going from start to  finish<br />She never fails to deliver and  keep you on your toes. I do not care for her daughters writing though as she lacks her moms imagination so do not bother reading Carol Higgens Clark you will be disappointed. Mary Higgins Clark can really write a book but for me her books  do not come out fast enough **
B00A81MV3U|5.0|loved the story line of the movie, got tired of the language; thought the stars did a fine job of<br />protraying their parts.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|How is this superior (or even different) from just using your camera? It crops? So does the camera app. It will mess the image up in order to make it look like a Xerox? Well, you've got me there. I guess I could ruin my images with instagram for free....<br /><br />This app makes no sense! How is it getting five star reviews?!??!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the horses look so real you can hardly see the flaws.  I like interacting with my horses every day to keep their happiness up.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|Good value, updating to some 3d movies and this is a must have in 3d.  Very happy with purchase of this DVD.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|For the most part I can't stand stories in the first person. Nonetheless, I decided to read this book due to the fact the movie was decent and everyone kept probing and telling me there were a lot of things I missed out on.<br /><br />At first I struggled with getting into the book. Katniss' character irked me for a while but then I just told myself to shut up ad keep reading. It was interesting enough but not as amazing as everyone had told me.<br /><br />Nonetheless it is worth a read if you are bored or curious. I read the entire book rather quickly and I am interested enough to seek out the next book.  I would have given it five stars but there is just something about it which won't bring me to do it.
014305841X|4.0|A great education (and humorous) trek from field to table.  The pig hunting story was grand and the ending was like Thanksgiving for the ear.
B008HK3XKO|2.0|It fells bulky and maybe i have not found the right way to do it, but i can only charge the Kindle if the cover is open.<br /><br />If someone knows how to solve this, please let me know!!!
1846071224|5.0|got it for my granddaughter and she loves it. children will sing with it and dance around the house. great value
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is such a good DVD and us so much better in 3d.  Arrived timely and was in good condition we really enjoy this movie
125000098X|4.0|The first two books were wonderful and full of suspense.  I ordered the third<br />book before it was written to be sure I got it right away.  I must say I was disappointed to find out that this one was continued also.  I thought \\"trilogy\\" meant three. I feel he struggled to get through this book and not sure I want to read the fourth.  He is a great author but think he stretched this family a little too far.  Would like a new one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm a spider guy for years and this is by far my favorite.I like the features like the touch to move the card and not have to drag,and the option of dealing without a full board.Great great game.
034580404X|5.0|These books have become listed as among my favorites.  The writing is fantastic and you can lose yourself in them very quickly.  They also will spice up your sex life if your willing to try some new things. ;)  There is nothing to complain about and once you read them you will wish you could have Christian all to yourself.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|I wish the app was a little more intuitive and the help would elaborate a little more. At first glance, you wouldn't think you could grab previous photos from your gallery, but you can. Click camera then click the landscape icon. What's the difference between scan and document? Help doesn't tell you. I think you can create multi-page documents by moving scans to specific documents. But you wouldn't know unless you tinkered with stuff. No real adjustments to enhancing the scan, either color or b/w. Finer tuning adjustments would have been nice.<br /><br />But all in all the app does what is supposed to do.
B004XZ99LO|4.0|We enjoy all these films, wish more were available in blu  ray 3d the colors are fantastic and the acts just amazing.  A great film to just escape from day to day issues
B0098VXMNE|1.0|This season is full of fake blood & fake sex!  There is very little story line & if you want to see porn, you would be better served to watch real porn.  The sex scenes are boring.  The stop action fight scenes, while interesting initially, quickly become boring.  I really wish we had not wasted our time or money on Spartacus Vengeance!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|game is awesome many levels and vehicles.  upgrades will keep u playing for days.  the only complaint I have is that its so freaking addicting
B005VPRFSY|4.0|I bought this set because of the sandtroopers - they simply look great and are a wonderful addition to any lego star wars enthusiast's collection of minifigures. That being said, the set is a little on the pricey side - 137 pieces for 18 dollars isn't bad but is still over the 10 cents a piece we like to see. The escape pod itself is not anything exciting, but is a great representation of what is in the film. The sandtroopers themselves start at around 6 dollars in the secondary market and you get two here.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This album is Darius Rucker at his best! True Believers and Wagon Wheel ( two songs that made me buy this album) are of course great, but the rest of the songs are just as good. Grand Work Darius-Keep it up with more, more, more!
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Love this, looks great on my 3d tv.  Have watched it several times very relaxing and just  breathtaking. We really enjoy it.

B002GHHHP6|4.0|Very funny and entertaining movie with some graet actors. Even had some really good scenes on the riverboat. Would love to take a trip on one.
125000098X|5.0|A continuation of a trilogy of books by Archer.  I suspect there will be a follow on as well and am looking forward to reading it too.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Once started I couldn't stop reading, so it did cost me 2 nights of sleep deprivation. But it was worth it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME VERY MUCH. IT IS VERY FAIR AND EASY TO BEAT. THIS IS THE FIFTH TIME I BEAT THE GAME.
0525478817|5.0|Great condition, excellent book.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys, as I do, young adult fiction reads.
B002ZG999U|3.0|Not one of my favorite movies, even though it had some good actors in it. just a little too far fetched.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|This case was adequate, but my grandson was not able to use the wires that are needed to be plugged into it to use it.  I want to return this item.
B0050XFYNA|5.0|Amazing story and I wish there was more, I wanted it to continue. Good acting and you can feel the love and passion between the 2 main actors.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|A fantastic collection of the finest fantasy literature of all time! A great read with plenty of depth and thrills to be had.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Was not able to watch the second season on tv so was eager to see it.  I was not disappointed.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|A couple years back, my friends showed me this game for the DS. I thought about it one day and looked it up. Bam! There it was on the appstore. It's really fun. An easy pass time. I give it 5 stars for just being fun!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's finally here! One of the best games from the android market and ios has finally made its way to the kindle fire. A great time waster and a fun game.
0345803485|5.0|It seems throughout that Christian is going to just be straightforward and D/s with Ana, however,<br /> he keeps asking her and practically begging her not to leave him. He buys her lavish gifts and shows up<br />unannounced and she just basically.... can not refuse him. Ana falls in love, this you can see...<br />ut Christian is a darker story and although I believe it will happen eventually, he does not<br />completely let go of his securities which are the BDSM lifestyle. The cliff hanger at the end was NUTS!!!<br /> I cried and rummaged through my ereader account until I was able to get my hands on book 2 and began<br /> reading almost instantly. This book was addicting. I found myself thinking about what would be<br /> happening next whenever I was not reading the book....<br />LOVED this first book, and have high hopes for the second and third..
B00138H876|4.0|Dylan is Dylan. Not predictable from one album to another (note the uproar over 'Nashville Skyline'). Good, solid, Dylan endeavor.
0439023513|5.0|Enjoyed the third book in the trilogy as much as the first.  Wish there were more to read!  Great story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fun so many things to build  I gave this  a five star rating it is worth the money
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book kept me up, kept me reading, even by flashlight on a trip to the lake!<br /><br />Hugh crafts an eerily realistic story with characters that you come to both love and hate. I alternated between sobbing out loud, holding my breath and shuddering in fear as I moved through all five segments, unable to stand the tension.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to finding more of Hugh's work, and to finding out what happens in Silo 17!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It would be better if you could use a log in, email, or  facebook to log in so that you can play the same game progress from different devices such as an android and kindle
B004EPYZXU|4.0|Seems I keep finding recent &quot;sci-fi&quot; movies as really thriller/horror/suspense movies and this is another one.<br /><br />I'm so done with horror movies about the group of teens stranded at the log cabin in the woods. Here we get a small group of guys stranded in space. At least with the teens in the woods there was always the hope that they could get back to civilization. Here, a more bleak setting is in play which for me heightened the hopelessness of the situation.<br /><br />This is not a gore fest or a pop-out and make you jump in your seat movie. This is a spooky, creepy flick. Which I really liked.<br /><br />The movie early on has just the right amount of liking the main characters and connecting with their friendship together. So much more than most movies that are plot driven.<br /><br />Yes, there were a couple of times something could have popped out of the dark and scared the viewer, but it didn't happen and I think that was part of the suspense because I was expecting it.<br /><br />The special effects were good, making the setting and &quot;things happening&quot; believable.<br /><br />The acting was well done. Better than most SciFy Channel movies.<br /><br />For me there were one or two plot holes, but they weren't so critical it didn't ruin the movie for me.<br /><br />OVERALL: Without giving too much away, I liked the entire premise of the story and the explanation of why this was the last visit to the moon. It was worth a watch and for me is a good movie that kept my interest in a spooky, creepy kind of way.
0439023491|5.0|This series is one of the best I have read in ages.  Young adult fiction has come a long way!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Wow, amazing read. So different then Enders Game, but in a class all its own. Epic drama an  just hard science fiction. Absolutely loved it, the mysterious piggies and the truth  about them will have you turning pages.
B00BJUQP4A|2.0|didn't seem like real photos. i thought it must be photo shopped<br />much too contrived to have value. interesting to look at, not to buy
B009NY43NY|5.0|One of the better ,wrapped up slot of lose ends,tied things  together nicely.  Ended the way I had hoped for all along.
B001OC4HSE|5.0|Loved this movie and Tom Baker being in it, made it a REAL BIG PLUS!!!! This movie is for anyone who is in to mystical and magical images!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Although I felt it looks a little bit smaller than advertise, the bag is very convenient.. It feels great when u wear it on your back, the weight is well distributed.. Also, it looks very nice..
0670451495|5.0|Perhaps because I am from the Boston area, this book has been a treasure in my whole family, and extended family, for generations.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book I think you should check it out too also check out some of the other books

0307352153|1.0|this book was sent by accident. I was to send War of the Worlds. I had looked at this book and somehow got sent instead. Haven't returned yet as have to go over to pick up from grandson. I need return label sent. Will have credit back to my account.
B000M341QO|5.0|This film is one of the best Martin Scorsese movies. This movie is full of an all star cast. You get suspense and thrills. This is a movie you would never believe what the ending is.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is best of the best. man I did 50 flips in one game. EVERYONE buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! air time
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Very pretty graphics make this fun as an artsy/design type game more than strategy. My one criticism is that the distribution of pearls as part of the game play is really stingy. Not sure if this game would be any fun at all without buying pearls using real money. I had a credit I used during the early levels of the game which were kind of critical to build a nice reef. Maybe just charge for the game and give more pearls with that version? The free game is a little too close to a bait &amp; switch.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy to hard levels to do this puzzle. Makes you really think about the paths your going to use. Good stress relief.
0812993845|1.0|Competent author writes a time waster. The \\"f\\" word is used in place of crisp dialogue, lust takes the place of character development, and the plot is slapstick. I gave up 2/3 of the way through and skimmed the ending. As penance, I will donate this one and my old Kinsella books to Goodwill.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Woody Allen doesn't again. A movie about attraction and intimacy. All the actors are great in this movie. The story line is there and the actors are on point.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Soo addictive I just can't stop playing it, pure awesomeness no other words to describe it. Reminds me of final fantasy sorta.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It may not be the best, but it works well for me at this price.  I've had no problems with it and I do like that I can rotate my kindle from vertical to horizontal.  I would buy it again.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It updates you on incoming mail. Easy to use and bring in new mail quickly. I like it so far.
1451695195|5.0|I have given this book to 3 people now.  Spread the word.  Very well written and life changing.  Don't just buy this and read it but share it with others.
B00B52F278|5.0|In my humble opinion there are very few TV shows that You feel compelled to watch over and over again. This is one of those rare shows. As I stated in my title I feel this show will be remembered forever. Not for the CGI nudity and violence, but rather how well the writers told this story. The CGI, nudity and violence were necessary tools to tell the story. The fact that these tools were ubiquitous does not subtract from the show. The nudity was artistic and the violence was authentic.  I would also like to say that most fans rarely talk at length about the nudity and violence, they talk about the story and acting. Many thought the show was doomed with the death of Andy me included. I've never been so thrilled to be wrong in my entire life. Liam's performance  under the circumstances will be the stuff of legend. Andy and Liam are both Spartacus.  Manu will always be Crixus.  I was in the military, a USAF pararescueman. That being said I really enjoyed watching characters that were helpless slaves evolve into warriors taking their destiny in their own hands. They were given nothing and earned everything they had. Every minute they lived free was a minute they had to fight for and was true blessing. Friendship and honor meant something back then. When You gave your &#34;word&#34; you kept it. These things are missing in today's society and we are not better for it. Freedom is taken for granted. Being in special operations I had to earn everything and evolve into warrior. To see this process on TV was an amazing and rewarding experience. I will buy this whole series and watch it over and over. When my kids are old enough I will let them watch it. This series is something You experience rather than watch. Congratulations Starz and to the actors involved for what You have created and most importantly thank you.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|Love the drama, shifts in plot, and suspense.  It keeps me interested and craving for more.  And, I love Glenn Close
0765325950|5.0|I have waited long for this. I can &#34;feel&#34; the difference in the writing... is not the same, the wording is different and in this book you can feel it more than the previous one, but the story is more important. I`ve been with these characters for years and years. It has finally coming to an end. I'm enjoying every page.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|That was such a wonderful game! It was creepy and just plain fun :D I wish it was longer, but it was a good way to spend some time!(:
B008P9M614|4.0|Received House M.D. Very quickly, Thank You!! I  haven't watched all of them yet<br />but I am very satisfied with them!! Another great collection I've bought from you!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|These contents would have been unthinkable five years ago in the broad Marketplace.  Intense in the storyline, characters and unfolding details.
1444710338|2.0|Some of the basic food items required for this diet are not readily available in the US.  Most of the recipes involve items that are hard to obtain and use metric measurements.  In my opinion, the premise is valid, but it is a very impractical way of eating requiring lots of special cooking and preparation.  I think there are better options out there for improving health and losing weight.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />I had some high hopes going into Side Effects. Judging from the trailers this looked like it was going to be an intense psychological thriller that had you sitting on the edge of your seat, and for the first 30-40 minutes that's exactly what you're given. However, this film's climax arrives too early which makes the rest of the film fall flat. Side Effects starts as a psychological thriller, but soon turns into yet another movie about money and it was honestly a little disheartening.<br /><br />The film follows a severely depressed woman by the name of Emily Taylor (Rooney Mara). Her husband Martin (Channing Tatum) has just been released from prison after being arrested four years ago for insider trading. For him this is his chance to start fresh and try to get the two of them back to where they were all those years ago. However, this proves to be more difficult than expected as Emily's depression is slowing down any progress he's trying to make.<br /><br />After a suicide attempt in a parking garage, Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) is assigned as her psychiatrist. In an effort to help control her depression he prescribes a series of SSRI anti-depressants, but none of them have any positive results. After consulting with Emily's old psychiatrist Victoria (Catherine Zeta-Jones) he decides to try a new drug called Ablixa. The drug appears to have some positive results with the only side effect being that she begins sleepwalking.<br /><br />Now this is the first half hour in a nut shell, minus the hard details. If the film would have continued down this path I probably would have loved it, but ten minutes later it switches up completely into something it doesn't need to be. The only positive outcome from this sharp change in direction is that it always keeps you guessing. You never know what's going to happen next or what secrets Jonathan is going to uncover and that's enough to keep you watching. With that said, even though it keeps you guessing none of what you find out is terribly interesting.<br /><br />What really drives this movie forward is the script. The script is extremely well written, even if I don't agree with the direction, and it keeps you on your toes. In a movie like this the script can make or break a film if it's predictable and, luckily, Side Effects if far from predictable. You're probably asking yourself \\"Well what's the big twist and why is it so terrible?\\" Unfortunately I can't really go into that. It's difficult to explain the change in direction without giving away the big, and unnecessary, plot twist. It's one of those films where if you know what's going to happen then there's no real point in watching it anymore (similar to Butterfly on a Wheel, a fantastic film by the way).<br /><br />The cast mainly consists of four main characters and a group of minor characters. The four main gunners are Mara, Law, Zeta-Jones, and Tatum. Objectively each of these actors gave outstanding performances. Mara in particular did a phenomenal job. Previously I've only seen her in The Social Network, but her role here is an entirely different animal. It's very raw and even chilling at times. Just a fantastic performance from start to finish. In addition to the four leads you get performances from Vinessa Shaw, Ann Dowd, Polly Draper, David Costabile, and Mamie Gummer. No one really gave a terrible performance, but most of the minor characters only received a couple of minutes of screen time.<br /><br />Finally, the musical score in Side Effects is phenomenal. Throughout the movie you'll get to here the lovely sounds of Thomas Newman, who's composed for many films including The Shawshank Redemption, Cinderalla Man, and Brothers. Along with the script, the music in this film really does a great job of grabbing your attention. It's big and grand when it needs to be, but it's also quiet and somber at just the right moments. Thomas Newman is just a fantastic composer who always seems to deliver so I'm not really surprised by how much I loved the score.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - Side Effects isn't really what I expected, or necessarily wanted, but it would be wrong to deny that it is enjoyable from start to finish. It takes an unexpected turn that I personally wouldn't have OK'd if I was working on the film, but there's not much you can do about it now. If you're looking for a film that's going to keep you guessing then look no further, just don't expect to be blown away by what you're given.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|It seems like they're not much to do, and it takes jewels to get some dragons, more than you can get short of buying them...
159463176X|4.0|Felt compelled to write a review, as I had adored his previous two works. Just finished the book yesterday, and, while it was more poetic than his previous two, and perhaps also sadder, I feel this one just could not compare to the might of it's predecessors. In all fairness, that could be only because the first two were masterpieces and it will be hard to match that level. Still very good reading, and I was simply absorbed until perhaps the last few pages, when somehow it became a little ho hum...
B005KMX866|5.0|Chris Isaak has outdone himself with this cd singing and sounding like the original artists of the songs,I love his music anyway but Ive nearly wore this one out,highly recommended.
B00CDCLL1A|1.0|There is a show named chopped, this should have been named that, the book was much easier to follow and this jumped around so much I lost interest. The only thing I liked was at the end they showed who did which part. I thought it was a bore.. 4  zzzz' s a real snore..........
B0087ITBPC|5.0|I loved Barbara Streisand and Seth Rogen.  The start was so so.  But the ending was kind of worth it all.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|i love this album. when i first got i played it a few times. very good cd and worth the money to buy it.
159463176X|5.0|Poetic, so intellectually probing. Viewing the intellectual progression of his works, I think Hosseini is not done with sharing his thoughts yet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so fun on Pc but my dad took it away. But then I found out about this! I mean if you spent your money on this you would not regret anything! Its the secound best thing ive ever played!  ( my first is starcraft 2)  (:
B00992CF6W|5.0|Actually, it is my grandkids who play it and they LOVE it!  They sit side by side playing it on tablets.
B00CW665VI|5.0|1st time I ever read a book where it's from the H's POV.  It's so different & so good!  R we sure the author, Emma Chase, is a woman?!  :)  Like 1 of the reviewer said:  'This is a book where every woman needs to read'.<br /><br />The story opens w/ Drew (our H)'s been sick w/ the flu (that's what he said he had)& his sister & best friend came to check on him @ home.  We find out H's a playboy/womanizer & 1 night he met Kate (our h) & of course!  everything starts to change 4 him!  What an ending!  H did messed up big time & he also groveled well!  Don't we love his adorable 4 yrs old niece?!<br /><br />This is a well written, stand-alone, pretty hot/steamy contemporary romance book w/ HEA!  Love it!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I remember watching this when I was but a little kid, so I decided to watch it again. Just for old-times sake. I loved it even more than I did than because I could understand the hidden themes and messages, and I would gladly watch it almost every day. An excellent choice!
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I have paid for these kind of apps and they kind of worked. This one as far as I am concerned is the best. Now I understand the issues of no front facing camera but I don't have that problem this also works great on my Galaxy S3.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Great book, for some reason I haven't read it before, I totally enjoyed this classic, although and old book now still a great one for sure.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it.  What more do I need to say?  I am only sorry it took me so long to get on board.  Easy to use, issue free, life is good!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Here is a tear-jerker if there ever was one! Enzo is an unusually smart dog. The book is narrated by his thoughts and he proves to be a philosopher with a human soul. He has educated himself by watching a lot of tv and listening to the words of his Master, Denny, a racecar driver. While Enzo is learning about life, he teaches the people around him about the true meaning of life and the reader comes away with a new perspective. A quick read, this book has the reader crying, laughing, and crying again. Bring your tissues!
B00355L2TU|5.0|I am only in my first week, but I can already feel my body getting stronger and fitter! Highly suggested.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game was a fun flashback game. It was easy to control and even reminded me somewhat of the original Space Invaders. Give it a try for some easy fun.
0553328255|4.0|This is a box with two books, and it came in perfect state. The paper is a bit grey, like a journal, but that is nothing compared to having the complete sherlock histories.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a good app but you have to buy tack to get presentation points. And most of the tack has to be bought with gems which is bother some unless you want to actually spend your money. Over all its a fun and entertaining app.
B005F3XV62|5.0|Very funny.  Kevin James is hilarious.  If you are looking to laugh your hats off to good clean humor, then this is the movie for you.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|Now What? I have waited a long time for some new music  from Deep Purple and happy to say it has been well worth it!<br />The band sounds great,this is becomming one of my favorite Purple cd's.I would highly recomend this cd,you won't be disapointed
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This batch of games has a good variety of puzzle games and challenges. It is a good time waster when you need a quick fix.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This game is epic the graphics kindalike COD epic but some guns cost alot much i mean its takes too long to earn money in order to get a good gun still EPIC!
0425252868|5.0|An excellent book about WW2 and the reaching down inside of one's self to do \\"the right thing.\\"  I like others thought all German military personnel were members of the Nazi party but how wrong I was.  It's feeds the soul to realize how opposing enemies do have \\"a higher call\\" and practice such.  If you are a WW2 buff, you will not want to put this book down. I recommend it highly.

B00884GR0W|3.0|Being a fan of Minecraft I must say that this is a fairly good knock off. I found the controls a bit hard to maneuver but I am used to the keyboard/mouse control of the PC Minecraft. I didn't go very far but it has some potential.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Will it work on kindle fire 7&quot;? I bought it and am really hoping it will because I spent money on this.
1400079144|5.0|After reading The Davinci Code and Angels and Demons, I pretty much knew what to expect and wasn't disappointed.  The action takes place over about a 24 hour period, which gives a great sense of urgency to the &#34;quest&#34; of our hero.  It is an action packed mystery with interesting philosophical ideas.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would like to say I am rather enjoying the masterpiece classic &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;. I first heard of the story from a coworker.  I am hooked.  The story line keeps you drawn in on many characters turn of events.  I wish they would produce more episodes that lasted all year long, like other shows do.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game for relaxation. Colors and figures are almost soothing. Have tried many different mahjong games and this one is very entertaining. I would recommend this to any mahjong player.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|It was good to be able to look at some maps without being tethered to my PC. I haven't had to use it very much but thought it was nice just playing around with it for a while.
0393061310|3.0|A fundamentalist Christian would not read this book -- too bad.  The scriptures say that a day is as a thousand years, so going back 15,000 years should not be a problem.  And the spread of agriculture from the Fertile Crescent supports the story of Noah's ark landing on Mt. Ararat.  Guns are OK, in the right hands, germs we can conquer, but the steel is in the wrong place -- it should be in the backbones of those who think they are the only ones who can lead.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It's ok but not the best game in the app store. But still a cool game. It's also fun to
B00007KWHG|5.0|I took my brother and his wife to see \\"Jersey Boys\\" for his 70th birthday - something he had on his bucket list and we all enjoyed so much.  My brother has been hospitalized two times this past year and he really enjoyed the show and the CD of the actual group was awesome and greatly appreciated.  It's a show that you could see over and over and having the CD is the best.  We are so happy to have the CD!  Amazon.com is awesome and the very best!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Loved this series.  Can not wait until next pieces - waiting anxiously! I got the idea in the suggestions area which gave ideas based upon my viewer profile. I like that feature of suggestions.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|What can be said about one of the greatest movies ever made. All the extras just make this collection something everyone who enjoyed the movie should own. The background of the making of the movie and the tidbits of the real family were exceptional.

B009MCRHH6|3.0|Sometimes the physics of the game were a little hard to get a grasp on but it makes you think about what you have to do to get to the next level. It was a little hard to control on a small device as the points were finer than you could tap.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This will be my third time having to delete game from my kindle then download again and start all over.

1401940676|5.0|the author reading this book was wonderful she kept you engaged throughout the book,  I loved it and passed it on to others
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|No need to think about if it was written or edited properly or if it had good grammar ....the story is real. Her life in captivity was real. The things she went through were real. What a great blessing that she was found. I was so emotionally involved from start to finish. Words cant describe how my heart feels. One thing that really impacted me the most was a part in the book about Phillip's visits to parole officers,counselors and psychiatrists.... I was outraged at lack of follow through. Yet he was being prescribed medications from his psychiatrist.... I believe in psychology but you cant know or diagnose a mental condition with one sit down or a piece of paper. Psychologists, therapists and psychiatrists should have some restricted visits to know what kind of conditions n environments the patient is subjected to. Specially people with records already. Criminals are good at manipulation and secrecy. They cant be treated with appointments. They have lost the rights of privacy when they have broken the law. She should've been found almost immediately, but by this horrible experience I know that it has re wired the concept of treatment that these criminals require. But not only criminals, we live in a overmedicated era. We are not being taught to take responsibility for our actions but to medicated it right away. ADD, ADHD, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, OCD, BIPOLAR, etc... I believe that medication helps, but a mood paper test cant be enough to prescribe meds. One of my girls was diagnosed with ADD after one visit so the next step was, these medications help.... I refused them and work hard at all the other possible options, last resort was medication and it helped temporarily and i was able to work through it and she is meds free. For adults it she be really important to get thorough follow ups, with drug testing involved and therapy.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I have a feeling that most of the bad reviews are from younger guys that expected Dubstep, but got this. The difference between Daft Punk's electronic music and pretty much everyone else is that they spend time fine tuning everything to give it an actual feeling. You connect with the music on a level that the other artists just can't do for you. This album's a bit slower and while it seems a bit different at times from things they've done before it doesn't draw far away from seeing that it's clearly Daft Punk. Besides, they've always brought something new and different to the table. Someone brought up that this wasn't much like Discovery and that's true; but while this is only somewhat like Discovery, Discovery was only a little like Homework. They've moved forward with their music and I think this has been great album and was worth the wait.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The game is cool and the animals are cute and cool and the animals and monster's<br />You get to breed

B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is a great time killer. It is easy to play. The old school game graphics are neat and very responsive to play. I've had this game for a while and really wanted to break it in before giving it a review. Lots of levels and easy to play. Think: space invaders.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I found this book to be the best of the trilogy, as it had mystery to it and a real villain, not just a perceived threat. The entire series was very well written, I anticipated it to be a \\"harlequin-esque\\" style romance novel and was pleasantly surprised.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is interesting to play.<br />But the challenges it throws can be handled onlu by experienced drivers.<br />It could be more interesting if minimal guidelines are provides
B00004XMTJ|1.0|Bought it for daugher.  We watched it for 15 minutes and were so bored, we turned it off.  The best part of this CD is the costumes.  Will donate to Good Will.
