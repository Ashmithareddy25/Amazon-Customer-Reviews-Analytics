1601251505|5.0|Can't add too much to the raves already given here, so I will add this.<br /><br />I started playing D&D in 1976. Made it all the way to 3rd edition, when they lost me. Trying to slog through 3.0 and then 3.5 rules, variations and the variations on the variations caused me to eventually throw up my hands and give up.<br /><br />Of D&D 4th edition, the less said the better.<br /><br />So while I never played too much 3.x, I did become a huge fan of Paizo products. They are almost uniformly well written, well illustrated and most of all, fun.<br /><br />Pathfinder is all of the above, and more. Somehow, someway they have cleared the cobwebs from this 50 year old gamers eyes. Suddenly, the rules make sense, the interrelations are clear and most of all, it looks like it is going to be fun playing the game.<br /><br />Finally, one of the more important concepts to me which was stressed by Paizo and the developers all throughout the process was the respect shown to the original rules and source material. \\"Sacred Cows\\" weren't \\"slain\\" just so some dork developer could crow about it. Paizo never told us that we weren't having \\"fun\\" when we played the previous editions. They did not have animated cartoon dragons \\"poop\\" on their critics. In short, Paizo did not show disregard and disrespect towards what came before them. They decided NOT to alienate the past customer in an effort to to grab some mythical new one.<br /><br />Buy Pathfinder. Try it. I think you will like it. It worked for me!

B000002LGQ|5.0|If I had to pick any one of Madonna's classic 80's albums that served notice to the world<br />that she was indeed an artist with substance and depth, and not just an overblown image<br />with shock appeal who manipulated the media like an evil genius, then 1989's \\"Like A Prayer\\"<br />would be the one that I'd play for them! Everything about it from the packaging,<br />to the production, to the material, the lyrics, etc., was much more thought out and<br />carefully crafted than the albums leading up to this...<br />Not that MADONNA (1982), LIKE A VIRGIN (1984) or TRUE BLUE (1986) weren't already iconic<br />pieces of pop art which were all well-recieved, but LIKE PRAYER was something else entirely!<br />From it's very release, it was fodder for controversy!--A Madonna staple! (-:<br />That now infamous multi-million dollar PEPSI endorsement deal V.S. the \\"Like A Prayer\\"<br />music video with Madge undulating and smooching with a gorgeous black christ-like figure<br />while a choir sang in the background and crosses burned!--OH MY!! (Tee-Hee!!)<br />MADONNA was/is a genius at starting a ruckus and manipulating it to her advantage!<br />But like I said, on this album she also showed that she was indeed AN ARTIST as well.<br />From \\"Like A Prayer\\" to the iconic \\"Express Yourself\\" to the emotional \\"Oh Father\\"<br />and \\"I Promise To Try\\" to the perky \\"Cherish\\"...to all of the others, Madge weaved a spell<br />on her fans and her 1990 BLONDE AMBITION TOUR set it all in stone for the whole world to recognize!<br />MADONNA LOUISE CICCONE was a bad mother--(Shut Yo' Mouth!!)--Well, I'm talkin' about MADGE!!--<br />(Well, we can dig it!) (-:<br />Even though this was a great album, it ranks as # 2 of my all-time faves<br />of MADONNA's classic '80's output in which she established herself as a force to be reckoned with!<br />TRUE BLUE is # 1, LIKE A PRAYER is # 2 and LIKE A VIRGIN is # 3!!---For my money!
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan since it first premiered back in the sixties. I taped all the episodes when Sci Fi ran them uncut. Thanks to DVD, and now Blu-Ray, however, you can own a great quality version of your favorite shows. This blu-ray set is fantastic. I am a purist...I don't like the idea that they messed with the classic shows and redid all the special effects. However, I am watching them that way out of curiosity. But the best part of this set is, the originals are still on here, in the same high quality blu-ray can offer. The interface is easy, the picture quality is supurb. I used to watch this in reruns in such bad quality prints, this is refreshing to see them like this. The audio is better than can be expected...truly a great effort in dealing with a classic. Highly recommended for the traditional Trek fan. Even if you don't like the revamped effects, the old ones are still here. Here is looking forward to season two, which I already have on pre-order.
1401216676|5.0|Yesterday I picked up The Killing Joke and loved it! Its a thin 46 page hardcover but, you wont notice how short it is since the illustrations will captivate you making the book seem twice as long. The first two pages haven't even one word but, I doubt you will notice since the expressions and body language tell a story that dosn't need words! I love Alan Moore's writing style; he creates characters with deep and complex personalities whom stand out from other comics with two dimensional personalities. I bought this book since Moore wrote it but, the detail and effort that went into illustrating real people and real emotions is what made me love this book! After I put it down, I skimmed through it and realized just how short it actually was and how much the graphics were the story!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|When a film comes around that's as good as The Dark Knight, you simply can't miss it. This movie has not only one or even a few amazing aspects; every way you look at it it's impossible to call it bad. It goes over the top in almost all areas, especially in its crazy, suspenseful story, incredible buildup of suspense, and unrelenting depiction of evil.<br /><br />(WARNING: This review contains many SPOILERS so I advise you to not read it unless you've seen the movie).<br /><br />The Dark Knight tells an intense, suspenseful, and crazy story. Batman (a.k.a. Bruce Wayne) has continued to strike at the criminals of Gotham since we left him at the end of Batman Begins, and the outlaws are now getting desperate. The Joker then comes up with a brilliant idea to get these outlaws out of their mess: kill Batman. His price to carry out the job is pretty much half of the money this group of bad guys has, and he gets his way by threatening to pull the string off a grenade right in their midst. Of course, the Joker walks away with the promise of a fortune, which he couldn't care less about, and then begins to have some `fun.' To get to Batman, he decides to make him reveal his identity, and every day he stalls, people die. The stakes are raised even higher when the Joker is captured and his insane acts of evil continue to the very end, even after his final defeat.<br /><br />One of the things that makes this film so memorable is the pure evil that is the Joker. Heath Ledger did a simply amazing job of portraying this character, and it's a shame that he'll never know he did the best acting job of the year. He portrays a villain that reveals the darkest corners of the human heart, a place I now have caught a glimpse of thanks to his incredible performance. The Joker is so brutal and merciless, blowing up a hospital being only one of his evil deeds. Yet despite his sheer brutality, he is absolutely hilarious as well. With lines such as \\"You complete me, you're just so much fun\\" and \\"I think we're destined to do this forever,\\" (both of which are said to Batman) Joker's performance shows comedic genius and also depravation of all that is good.<br /><br />Another interesting character is Harvey Dent. He is really a key figure in the plot, and he ends up teaching one of the more important lessons to glean from the film. He is Gotham's new district attorney, and ends up putting hundreds of criminals in prison within the course of a few days. His character and inspiration is portrayed in many scenes, and the court scene where he takes the guy's gun shows what he's like in his position and is also laugh out loud funny. But Gotham's White Knight (as they call him) ends up losing his future wife, and that on top of getting half his face burned off and a nice talk with the Joker contributes to him descending into madness. Throughout the final scenes of the film, Dent is seen killing people he finds responsible for the death of his beloved, and even shoots the Dark Knight himself. Dent is a clear portrayal of how people can go bad; how no man is good within his own power. If you think about it, Dent is also contrasted by the criminal who throws out the detonator in the ferry at the end of the film, a `bad guy' who does the right thing. I found that very interesting.<br /><br />And of course, who could forget the Dark Knight himself? Again excellently portrayed by Christian Bale, Batman has many struggles in this film. Throughout the entire film, he is being pressed to reveal his identity, all the while struggling to protect the people of Gotham. Christian Bale makes a perfect Batman; he does a great job of portraying the wasteful billionaire by day and the dark, shady, rough-voiced Batman by night.<br /><br />The entirety of The Dark Knight is centered around suspense. The buildup of tension is incredible, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat more than this. There's always the question of \\"Who is the Joker goingto target next?\\" or \\"When will Batman reveal his identity to stop the killings?\\" or \\"Is he really going to blow up the hospital?\\" And the sequences of the film are all done so well that it really keeps you into it every moment and never loses you attention for a single breath.<br /><br />The tension also builds up by way of sound. Hans Zimmer composed the score for The Dark Knight, and in that lies some incredibly epic pieces of music and some aggravating, yet tension-building, sounds. These noises hard to describe, actually, but they build up the suspense in an extraordinary way the likes of which I have never heard before. The music is just plain epic, giving you that hair-raising feeling that either something terrible is about to happen or Batman is about to do something insanely awesome. Or both.<br /><br />The Dark Knight also has some fantastic visual effects. The explosions are spectacular, Batman's stunts are very entertaining, and everything seems totally realistic. The effects are quite plentiful too, but sometimes you forget they are effects because they just look so real.<br /><br />Before I continue ranting and raving about how ridiculously awesome The Dark Knight is, I think I should end this review. The Dark Knight is one of the very best movies I have ever seen with its fantastic and deep story, amazing visual effects, quality acting, epic soundtrack, and buildup of suspense. The suspense is really one of the film's strongest points, and the ways in which that is done can be looked to as an example for future films. When it's all said and done, The Dark Knight is just 2 ½ hours of awesomeness.<br /><br />SCORE: 10/10s identity to stop the killings?\\" or \\"Is he really going to blow up the hospital?\\" And the sequences of the film are all done so well that it really keeps you into it every moment and never loses you attention for a single breath.

B00007J5VN|3.0|My love and admiration for Federico Fellini/Guiletta Masina's film Nights of Cabiria had stopped me for long time from seeing Sweet Charity, the adaptation of the musical based on the same story which was made into a highly successful Broadway show directed and choreographed by a multitalented Bob Fosse. I am a fan of Bob Fosse. I love all his films, musicals and not, but I was hesitant to see Sweet Charity the movie and I never had a chance to see the Broadway musical. Well, I finally did and I can say that nothing is wrong with transporting the same story to the different time, place, language, medium, and to use the different artistic tools. The story is the same; the films are as different as Rome and NYC or as Federico Fellini and Bob Fosse. Fosse's film should be judged on its own terms, and it has a lot of breathtaking scenes to enjoy, bright colors, outrageously stunning costumes (the work of incredible Edith Head), adorable and unbelievably cute Shirley MacLaine, Sweet Charity Hope Valentine, and the best of all - the dancing sequences to die for. Among them, splendid The Big Spender is perfection and the real treasure. Fosse's staging of the musical numbers is outstanding. The most memorable moment in the movie for me was stolen from Shirley MacLaine by Chita Rivera in Big Spender. Just watch Rivera's seemingly boneless arms, the right one around her head and the left one behind her back, the left hand on her right hip as she sings, \\"do you want to have fun, fun, fun?\\" For this moment alone, I like the film even if I see very well that it has some minuses, too. The first act between two intermissions was really good, and it includes the best dancing and singing numbers: \\"Hey, Big Spender\\", \\"The Pompeii Club\\", \\"Rich Man's Frug\\", and \\"If They Could See Me Now\\". After the second intermission the movie went over the hill. I believe that it could do without both intermissions. We are not watching the show at the theater, and the intermissions only took time. The \\"hippiest\\" \\"Rhythm of Life\\" scene was overlong, did not make much sense, and made me want to fast-forward it. I take it that Fosse wanted to experience with the camera movements and different techniques in his very first feature film which was a screen transfer of his Broadway Musical. This is the only explanation of his multiple slow-motions, stills, color/black/white and back changes that did not add anything to the film, just paused it with no apparent reasons. His next screen adaptation was timeless Cabaret, and he had improved his directing style dramatically. As the result, Cabaret has stayed his greatest achievement along with All That Jazz.<br /><br />Coming back to the original tragic comedy \\"Nights of Cabiria\\", of all the characters Fellini had given life on screen, by his own words, Cabiria was the only one he worried about many years after the film was made. Of all the characters, I've seen in films, Cabiria is the one I often think about - whatever happened to her? Did she survive? Was she able to find love? As much as I like Shirley MacLaine/Charity, I did not worry about her future. She lived happily ever after - in both movie endings, theatrical and alternative.<br /><br />3.5/5e \\"hippiest\\" \\"Rhythm of Life\\" scene was overlong, did not make much sense, and made me want to fast-forward it.

B0018SWA56|5.0|I thought that \\"Something Borrowed\\" was excellent...until I cracked open \\"Something Blue\\".  This book was phenomenal as it brought out so many powerful emotions.  I was one who rooted for Rachel in \\"Something Borrowed\\" but I loved to read how Darcy grew out of the superficial, Manhattan socialite into a grounded woman who found love on her own terms.  I understood how lost she must have felt when she first moved to London even though she was living with a childhood friend.  I loved reading how their relationship evolved from friendship to love.  I cried during the delivery of her twins and her marriage to Ethan. I also cried during the her first conversation with Rachel.  It took heart and soul to forgive a betrayal like Dex and Rachel's.  I know that I couldn't forgive a betrayal like that...even if I did find love.  This was a very well written book that leaves you smiling when you read the final page.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|Let's not call this one a come back but a baby step toward her comeback. Voice rough in spots and other areas stellar; not sure if this is 100% studio mixing or ??  Songs are poorly written which is not her fault. True fans will have to buy it, but wait for a sale. I am still looking forward to her next CD, which I hope for her, comes quickly on the heels of this one.   CD offers two great songs, which is like 10% of the entire content.

B00008LOS1|5.0|Let me state the obvious.  The epic 'Who's next' ranks as one of the greatest accomplishments in music history.  However, lets not forget the packaging of this deluxe edition.  In an age with music downloads, the CD has become almost an after thought.  Not in this case!  You'll get a high quality, durable package that opens like a book.  The discs  are designed to look like the original record.  The booklet is more like a novel -- almost 30 pages including some rare photos. There's no question this will become a collectors item down the road.  You also might want to check out the Who's other deluxe editions.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|Ok Ok Ok, finally Whitney is back and I am so happy. The first song I heard was \\"For The Lovers.\\" I start off with that one first and repeat it at least 3 times. That song is the foundation. I love it. \\"NOw throw your hands up, if u single , but u looking for another, Ladies tell your man you love him, yea yea yea yea, fellas tell your girl u love her, yea yea yea yea. I love it. To me it brings u back to the old whitney of Whitney. To me it reminds me of So Emotional, one of her best. \\"I got You\\" would follow. Love it cause its simple with the echo.\\"Cause on that final day, I put all the hurt and pain, would end up on the topppppppppppppppp\\". She sounds good, beautiful. The whole album as a whole i would say B-, just cause that aint the old Whitney, but I like the new Whit. Singing in the low range and able to still run and sing the melody. The melody of course is most important in any song. Her background on all songs still sound the same. Thats why i love Brandy the most as far as background. Brandy learned well from Whiteny. I could not wait til the album when it came out. So happy and proud of my girl Whitney Houston cause I Aint got, \\"Nothin' nothin, nothin', but Love for ya, Nothin' But Love, Nothin But Love.
0385341008|4.0|I recently purchased 11 copies of this book for our neighborhood book club to read.  I just finished my book and found it to be wonderfully informative, witty and a totally different read.  The characters were developed in such a way that I felt that I actually knew them.  At first the assortment of characters is a bit overwhelming though and until their personalities are developed it is a bit hard to keep track.  That being its only fault I would highly recommend this book and can't wait until we meet to discuss it.
160751155X|5.0|Mr. DeMille either was a cop, or talked with a lot of them, because I found the language of the character completely in tune with east coast cops I know.  The book was not what I expected - in a good way.  Things kept changing, but I didn't feel manipulated by plot twists - I felt like I was along for the ride with the characters.  Highly recommended!
B001LOU8ME|4.0|msg,s one night at budokan, is an interesting live document of the line up that made the second michael schenker group album known as;MSG.shortly after this live album was released in 1982 the line up that made it was no more.i like it for the most part it is great although there are schenker fans that will ultimately see it as not as good as ufo,s strangers in the night which was released in 1979 which michael schenker played like a demon on!!!for those few who may not know this fact before michael group, michael was a member of UFO which is an excellent hard rock band,during michaels time with UFO michael cowrote most of UFO,S greatest songs as well as playing some of the most amazing guitar work in hard rock.so for me the stand out tracks on this one are;cry for the nations,armed and ready,on and on,ready to rock,and attack of the mad axeman,also interesting on this remaster is the inclusion of cozy powell,s drum solo.as with the new UFO remasters the MSG remasters have an improved sound quality and cool booklets with some excellent photos of the bands back in the day!!as a schenker fan i grabbed it right up!!
B000N6TX1I|3.0|This looks great. A lot of time was poured into set design here, making post-apocalypse London look grim, indeed. However, it falls down on plot line and audio quality. Was it just me, or was the dialogue very hard to make out, never mind the thick British accents? A few years into the future, no babies have been born for 18 years and the world population is dying off, split among re-\\"fugees\\"- and the rest, a commentary on today's war on terror, one presumes. But one woman delivers a baby, and the movie is all about trying to get her ... somewhere....called \\"the human project.' I have no idea what that was. Most of the movie is a long chase scene through war zones and various attacks, shot by handheld camera. The look is fascinating, but the content is a weakness.

B000NU2CY4|3.0|Having just watched it, the reports of Gladiator's travesty on blu-ray seem to have been somewhat exaggerated by a mob of detractors befitting of the Roman Coliseum.  I can certainly acknowledge that it does indeed exhibit very noticeable edge enhancement causing shimmering images and flickering most noticeably on objects such as chainmail and other accoutrements and the opening titles suffer most of all from heavy color banding and solarizing the result of the DNR post-processing.  However the (blu-ray) sky isn't falling and claims of \\"vanishing arrows\\" and spears \\"disappearing\\" in mid-air seem to have been blown out of proportion and I had no problem at all seeing them on my 46\\" LCD.  There is no doubt that the picture quality could have been improved, and for the debut of Paramount's so-called \\"Sapphire Series\\" this presentation is something of an embarrassment for the studio and its reputation for future releases under this banner seems questionable, but the detail and clarity of resolution are better than watching the upscaled DVD copy.  The extras are insightful and the sound is nothing short of spectacular.  Still, I did not let these moderate technical flaws detract from the overall enjoyment of the spectacle of the film itself.<br /><br />As Maximus would say, \\"Are you not entertained?!?!?\\"<br /><br />*spits*
0307269981|5.0|If you enjoyed Stieg Larsson's first book in this series, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" you will really enjoy his follow-up.  The book focuses much more heavily on the most interesting character from the first book, Lisbeth Salander, and goes much more in depth into her past, in fact the entire plot centers around her past and the events that have shaped her into the unusual character she becomes.  \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" has even more twists and action than its predecessor and is a very worthwhile read.

0307269981|5.0|The Girl's got Soul<br />This is book 2 of the Lisbeth Salander trilogy by Stieg Larsson.  Although very good, it falls a little short of his tour de force The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  At 500 pages it is a rather long read with the first 300 pages written to set the stage for the climatic 200 page explosive finish.  During the first half of the book I found my mind wandering at times as Mr. Larsson over wrote his setup for the intense conclusion.  The Swedish names can also be a bit confusing, so the reader needs to pay attention to keep the many characters in focus.  Lisbeth Salander, the protagonist, is an extremely complex, multi-faceted character that continually surprises the reader with her incredible insights and intuition.  She is a delight to be savored through the entire book.  The antagonist(s) are many and add to the interesting nature of Mr. Larsson's complex work.  After the initial literary table setting, the story picks up speed and roars to several dramatic conclusions.  I do NOT want to spoil any of the reading fun, so I won't reveal anymore of this mystery thriller except to warn the reader that all is not as it seems(?).  So keep focused and keep reading, trusted me it will all be worth it!<br />BTW, you do not have to have read Mr. Larsson's first book of the trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but it sure would help in certain areas of this book to understand certain nuances.<br />Character development was excellent if not overwhelming.  As a continuation of the trilogy, Mr. Larsson does a good workman like job of keeping the reader involved of critical events from book #1 that play out in this book.  It will be very interesting where Mr. Larsson goes with book #3.<br />No gratuitous sex, some language and many graphic scenes of violence.  All germane to story development.  Still be warned on the violence as it can be very graphic and might be troubling to some readers. Strong recommend even at today's hefty hardback prices.  Look for discounts or get it at your local library.  Much too good to wait for the paperback.  Wonderful for that long get-away vacation.  I am anxiously looking forward to the concluding book in this trilogy, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  It is too bad that Mr. Larsson passed away after writing the 3rd book.  He is a terrific writer and will be sorely missed.et it at your local library.  Much too good to wait for the paperback.  Wonderful for that long get-away vacation.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I really did LOVE this movie. I am a huge fan Of Jemima Rooper from HEX. It was very interesting to see her do a period piece, are there anymore with her in it? Anyway, I love Jane Austen and this was a Perfect find too introduce people to Lady Austen in a way that is not too stuffy and pretentious.<br /><br />I fell in Love with all of the characters and I was really hoping that it was actually a start to a TV Series. That could still happen, right? LOL<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to people that enjoy Historicals,Time Travel and Comedy. Because make no mistake this Movie is ALL of these things.<br />I cried and laughed while rooting for both main characters. In a weird way i wanted them both to have<br />Mr. Darcy. (oh man, not like THAT!, Sorry.)
1577311523|5.0|Eckhart Tolle speaks of living every moment in subtle but intense joy, peace, and love.  How is this possible?<br /><br />The book answers this question by presenting as series of questions raised in his lectures and his answers.  The questions are sometimes challenging and argumentative.  The answers are frequently blunt and to the point.<br /><br />The book has a simple and straightforward ring born of experience and insight.  Parts may be difficult for the modern mind to grasp and may be challenging to those tied strongly to a particular religion.<br /><br />I'm happy I finally read this book, but I will avoid wishing I had read it sooner.  I have not yet been able to follow his simple advice consistently, but have had enough experiences to keep at it.<br /><br />Read the book, try if and see if you experience the real you - full of joy, peace and love - not experienced at some time in the future, but at the present moment, right now.
1594202249|4.0|First off, cool cover design by Tal Goretsky and Darren Haggar... these guys deserve credit for their eye-catching pulpish art.<br />Now let's get to the content: Pynchon's rendering of LA in the 60's and his ribald, unique bent on stoner noir is hilarious. He makes you want to roll a number and put on some Electric Prunes. I loved the offbeat characters... In Pynchon's world before there was legendary Laird Hamilton there was St. Flip of Lawndale \\"for whom Jesus Christ was not only personal savior but surfing consultant as well\\" and \\"what was walking on water, if it wasn't Bible talk for surfing?\\" I understand Pynchon lived in LA during the 60s and 70s while writing his epic Gravity's Rainbow, so he calls it as he remembered it, whether that recollection was refracted through a drug haze, that's entertainment for us and we are the benefactors. He paints landscapes  from Gordita to Watts...  Gilligan's Island to a mysterious boat called the Golden Fang... conspiracies abound man.... I dug it! It's like Raymond Chandler on acid, man!
0767836324|5.0|Great old movies all three that we purchased recently. Popeye was great although I understand did not do well at the cinema. Love Robin Williams so Hook had to be next. Hocus Pocus again another great movie which we will watch again and again. Also our grand children love these DVDs so they are added to our collection. All light hearted comedy no violence and all very funny,
0575083093|4.0|This novel is a very inventive and satisfying space opera. The premise is a good one, and I found the ending fitting and moving. The plot was complex but cohesive and the characters well-developed, interesting, flawed, and sympathetic. I even thought Reynolds handled the all-too-usual Oedipal sub-plot very ingeniously. I went on to read the next three novels set in this universe. \\"Sophomore slumps\\" are common with second novels; Chasm City, not a true sequel, was nevertheless an enjoyable, respectable effort. But I can't think of another writer whose work got steadily worse the longer he kept at it. The political developments in Redemption Ark were plausible and intriguing, but his characterization skills were faltering--I really wanted to like the pig-human hybrid, as I was obviously intended to, but he just struck me as cartoonish--the plot dragged for long periods of time, and the writing, adequate in the earlier books, simply wasn't up to Reynolds's ambitions. I slogged on, I wanted to see how it all ended, but at the last I resented Absolution Gap for wasting my time (my own fault, I suppose). Horris Quaiche, the Quaicheist cult, and the city on rails I found contrived and preposterous. And \\"contrived\\" just begins to describe the problems with the surprise ending; I found it unprepared-for, unearned, forced, infuriating. So I am happy to recommend both Revelation Space and Chasm City to fans of space opera. After that, let the reader beware. I doubt if I will read any more of Reynolds's books.
B000NU2CY4|2.0|After watching this Blu ray, I have to agree with many of the other people complaining about the transfer.  Although it was a little bit better than I expected, I too often found myself pulled out of the experience of the movie by distracting artifacts or what looks like excessive digital processing.  It's sad because many shots look good, and the colors definitely \\"pop\\" more than on the DVD, but more of the movie looks like I'm watching it on TNT HD or even DVD.  At least the audio is a steup up, although why didn't they go for 6.1 or 7.1?  This was supposed to be Paramounts \\"Sapphire Series\\".  If this is what they have in mind, I'm not buying next time.  I also watched \\"Braveheart\\", also part of the Sapphire Series, which has a beautiful transfer on Blu ray.  It's a shame when you think that \\"Gladiator\\" could've looked like that, too.  Winner of 5 Academy Awards, and less than 10 years old, and this is the best they can do?  I'm just glad I got Gladiator on sale, and I also get a rebate for being an owner of the DVD version.  If I was anyone else, I'd wait for the price to drop below $14.99.  Paramount should reissue this movie with a new transfer for Blu ray.
B000YKG5L4|5.0|I had adored \\"Stop and Stare\\" since first hearing it when it came out. I finally purchased this album a couple of weeks ago. I can't find a song that I didn't enjoy listening to. My favorites are Tyrant, Mercy, Prodigal, and you know what, most of the songs are favorites. I think there's only one or two that I don't -love- but still like. It is one of the best albums for just clearing my head and relaxing, and I cannot wait for the next album to come out!
B002DYKP8S|5.0|Amazing film... a little slower paced than many of the other \\"martial arts\\" movies of its era, but flawless in its delivery. Some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen. Elegant, fluid, poignant... We need more movies like this! A must have for any movie lover
B000A2RRF4|4.0|Really a great DVD, with great music and dancing. The only problem it was of poor quality.Other than that I enjoyed it.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Just watched this Blu-ray version.  I realize the negative reports of this BD movie and have seen some imperfections in this film.  However, IMO I do not feel the movie is as bad as people are making it out to be.  Alot of people are basing their opinions on screenshots.  To actually judge a movie one must actually watch it.  This is what I did, and I feel this movie is completely watchable.  Most of the movie looks very good and would give 4 out of 5 stars for the picture quality.  If I had to make a decision again to purchase or not, I would purchase this movie again.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Not a family movie, as I'm not sure children can fully follow or appreciate the story.  It was a great gift for my parents, though. No special day, just got mentioned in conversation and I enjoyed the movie so much that I got it for them, knowing they'd enjoy it.
B001IBC9A4|3.0|don't be put off by my relatively low star rating -- 5-star is reserved for the immaculate orgasm.  i'm very pleased with this recording. only passively listened to it a couple times.  looking forward to further listenings.  no technical errors that make me cringe, which is rare (lack of gross technical errors is rare, that is... i'm always crawling out of my skin with the average recording at this price point...) i'm happy to have this recording in my library and would seriously consider buying another recording from quator ebene.
0545123267|4.0|Werewolves don't necessarily change with the phases of the moon. At least not in Minnesota. There they change with the season. When the winter comes, they lose their human forms and become wolves. When spring's sun rewarms the earth, they shed their pelts and return to their human lives.    Grace has watched the wolves from her back yard since she was a child. One wolf in particular has always been \\"her\\" wolf. The yellow-eyed beauty seemed to be ever-present during her winters. One fall, after a local boy is killed by the wolves, Grace finds herself face-to-face with a naked, gunshot-wounded, human who has her wolf's eyes. Sam is Grace's wolf. As they spend time together, growing in their love for one another, Sam is constantly having to fight the cold to keep his humanity.    As winter pursues them and more controversies arise surrounding the local boy's death, the wolves find them selves running out of time and Grace and Same must face the impending reality that will keep them apart.    A wonderful love story filled with hope and humanity, Shiver is an incredible novel. There was some lack of minor character development and some loose ends left undone, but the main story is resolved and the reader receives a feeling of completion. Beautiful!
0439023491|5.0|hardly wait for the sequel to come out.  And now, having just finished<br />Catching Fire, I know I'm in for an even more agonizing wait for book<br />three.<br />I was totally surprised by the plot of this book, in a good way.  I<br />was expecting a very different story direction.  But what Suzanne<br />Collins has done is so much better.  She further develops the<br />characters that I loved from HG and introduces new ones that are<br />equally compelling.<br />And I love the 1st person POV in the present tense.  It is difficult<br />to write that well, but Suzanne does it effortlessly in a way that<br />maintains a deliciously unbearably sense of urgency.  These books are,<br />without a doubt my new favorite and number one recommendation to<br />anyone.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|I had no expectations of this movie having never read or heard of the book. I bought it because Emma Watson was in it and was curious to see her outside of the Harry Potter character of Hermione. She was wonderful, as were all the girls. I loved this movie. It took me back to the dreams I had as a young girl and still dream of to this day. This movie will touch all girls and women of any age. I'll watch it over and over again.
B001G549C8|1.0|Perhaps this film is in the public domain, as there are many different copies available on Amazon.  This is NOT the one to buy.  It appears to have been copied from a very low-quality source, like VHS or broadcast.  The picture is filled with digital artifacts.  And the audio is distorted and difficult to follow.  Shame on these guys for even offering this!
B00288KNLS|2.0|Not sure what all the excitement is about.<br /><br />Who was this for?  It's far too scary to be a kids' movie; not scary enough to be an adults' movie, and it gets off to an awfully slow start, with many unnecessary characters.<br /><br />And it was just to trippy, too dreamy.  I know it comes from a book, and it probably works better as a book.  The relentlessly surreal sequences toward the end got to be too much.

0792843584|3.0|A mediocre movie overall, in some ways Heaven's Gate was lucky to have gotten so completely slammed back in 1980. If it had received the middle-of-the-road reception it deserved, we'd all have forgotten it by now. But young movie buffs watch it to see if it was really all that awful. And us oldies return to see if we can remember just what the hubbub was all about back in the day. This movie gives us Kris Kristofferson before he ravaged himself and Christopher Walken at the height of his out-of-place ethereal young beauty.  Cimino was obviously a director who appreciated attractive, talented young men with a future; also giving us a young Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston (pre-Law and Order), John Hurt and Brad Dourif, in addition to an unknown Mickey Rourke in a small part and Willem Dafoe as an undcredited extra.  So, in my latest viewing of this film, I note the disparity between the treatment of men and women by Cimino.  Isabelle Huppert stands out in the only good female part.  But, even though she is playing a working girl, Ms. Huppert is left to look drab and virtually make-up free.  In scenes with both she and Walken the amount of make-up on the already well-dressed Walken reminds one of silent movie cosmetics.  And the scene where Walken takes Kristofferson's hat and eyes himself admiringly in a mirror reinforces one of the ruling errors in the making of this film.  The story is laden down with factual errors typical of the average Western.  Michael Cimino was more interested in displays of male beauty and Western vistas.  Heaven's Gate is a self-indulgent work of art by that helped bring down a studio and, in the long run, hurt thousands of people employed in the film industry by making is harder to get funding to make good films.  It is, however, a work of art showing a single artist's world view and, for that reason, worth watching.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|This movie sucked worse than a vacume! Who wants to watch a movie where super heroes act more like villans.  Lost 2 hours of my life i can never get back!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD very much.  It arrived VERY quickly--great service.  Thanks.    Naomi
0812932293|2.0|Good writing, but too detailed. Not enough information about his business actions, too muuch about daily life. My son in law felt the same way. We each got through half of it, then just too \\"ponderous\\", a word I have never used before.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|I received this movie as a Christmas present about four or five years ago, and I finally watched it recently! I liked the first half of it, then the next half was kinda dull just trying to find their daughter in their house. Some ghosts begin to haunt the Freeling house, like stacking up chairs, talking to little Carol Anne, and then the ghosts turn deadly by making a tree coming to life and attacking the son. I loved that clown they had, I wish I had one. If you like ghost stories, you'll probably like POLTERGEIST!!!
0312370849|5.0|I have a friend who belongs to  a book club and this book was rated very high and was on the list of 10 best books for a long time.  I was curious to read it and I was not disappointed, It was a book that was hard to put down. I gave the book to my Daughter and I am sure she will like it and probably share it with others.

0743442539|5.0|While I'm still at the beginning of John le Carre's bibliography, I'm still amazed at how he can write a complete novel yet still keep the page count down.  It's so different than today's 400 page doorstops that could stand a fair amount of trimming.  The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is a tightly woven espionage story from the Cold War days, and le Carre keeps the twists and turns coming at a non-stop pace.<br /><br />The story revolves around a burned out British spymaster, Leamas, who wants to call it quits.  But before he does, he's asked to do one more job involving the capture of East Germany's most notorious espionage agent, Mundt.  The scene is set to make Leamas look like a washed up spy who is on the outs with his government, and therefore ripe for recruiting.  And of course, the other side takes the bait.  He's debriefed for much of the basic info, but they want to take him over the border back into East Germany and beyond to find out even more.  Things take a bit of a sideway turn when the British government puts an all-points bulletin out for him, and it looks as if Leamas may really need to follow through on what looks like a full defection.  But the deeper he gets, the more confused he is as to who is working for who, and whether he ever will be allowed to come in from the cold...<br /><br />The aspect of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold that I enjoyed most was le Carre's way of keeping the reader guessing as to what was actually going on behind the scenes.  As with real-life espionage, nothing is ever black and white, and shades of grey are the best you can get.  Leamas thinks he has everything under control, but he soon finds that what he signed up for and what is actually happening could well be two different things.  le Carre does this all in 212 pages, which is remarkable.  I'm looking forward to continuing on with all his other books, as I expect them to follow in the same vein of tight writing and good storytelling.
0312944098|4.0|Archer's retelling of Dumas' Monte Cristo keeps one a prisoner of the book until the very end. Of course, the story is hopelessly fantastic, improbable and exhilarating. One gets to love the characters, and all along hopes that the plot turns out well for the survivors. At times, the read is actually funny. One feature I found highly interesting is Archer's depiction of class difference and distinction. London Eastenders and Westenders are portrayed wonderfully as their personifications clash. Archer relies very much on the language used by people coming from diverse parts of the same city and on how they are likely to behave. What may surprise the reader is how he makes this pivotal to the successful outcome of his story. Then there are also the twists and turns of the story, which make it truly enjoyable. It is fun.
B000086EOE|5.0|Ah, this is the great prog rock album. You have the brilliant musical mind of Steve Hackett, you have an all star line up of great prog musicians and back that all up with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Oh, and did I mention, they will be performing reworked Genesis music? So, if you're a Genesis fan or a fan of thoughtful progressive rock. This would be welcome in any good prog rock collection.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I bought this album because of a song I saw on GAC and because I grew up with Garth Brooks.  I was pleasantly surprised to find so many songs that I recognized and love.
B000J10ER4|3.0|Movie is clean and older child friendly.  The acting could have been better.  Superman character was sweet and comes across as almost helpless.  IT is hard to review since no one could take Chris Reeves place. As a whole, I did find it entertaining and had to buy the first 4 to find out in what original segment when Superman could have become a father.  I just wish they could have carried it a little further, I felt like it left us hanging in the air.  After all what part was he going to play in raising his child.
B0024FAG1W|3.0|I really liked this movie when I first saw it, years ago. Watching it again now, I have to shake my head in rueful astonishment.<br /><br />There's a shocking scene in the TV series \\"Mad Men\\" where a '60s family pack up after a picnic and simply dump all their trash out on a beautiful green lawn. Times change, huh?<br /><br />I thought about that when our hero Frank Murphy, a police helicopter pilot played by Roy Scheider, saved himself by tricking the bad guys into firing missiles into a crowded barbecue joint and a high-rise office tower, and again when he shot up a civilian apartment building while trying to take aim on a bad guy in another chopper. This was particularly grating since Murphy had earlier spoken against the bad guys' low regard for civilian lives.<br /><br />Forget the characters. Forget the plot. They will only annoy you. This movie is stunt porn, pure and simple, and given that it was made before the era of computerized special effects, we have to respect the ingenuity, skill and courage of Hollywood stunt people.<br /><br />The movie is dumb, but entertaining. Lots of stuff gets blowed up real good, and helicopters are cooool. If you want more than that, you'll want to look elsewhere.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|This group is DIFFERENT.I'm amazed,and I'm buying this CD TODAY.I just saw them on Letterman,and heard there song \\"Home,\\"and LOVED it.  I can't wait to hear the rest of the record after seeing this band.
0439023491|4.0|There are plenty of general reviews so I will concentrate on certain aspects of the book.  As you can see from the 4 stars, I liked it a lot.  And I'm sure that if you liked The Hunger Games, you will also like this book. If you have not yet read The Hunger Games I suggest you do so before reading this book. I think important elements will simply lack the proper impact without the foundation it provides.<br /><br />I felt the first book, The Hunger Games, was an adventure tale with exceptionally strong emotional and relationship elements. This book, Catching Fire, seems to me to be more about relationships with an adventure tale attached. I say this with the highest of praise.  Lots of books (particularly YA books) make for ripping good yarns without really looking at how their characters interact beyond a pretty superficial level. Fire is very different.  I think the author intended this story to be as much about how we see, judge, and deal with people as about Katniss' struggles against the corrupt Capitol.<br /><br />There were elements of this in the first book, but now they really drive everything Katniss says, does, and even thinks.  And beyond the characters, the districts themselves and their relationships with the Capitol become of vital importance. It will be interesting to see if this is a theme Collins continues in the third book, or if she will return to a more typical adventure novel style.<br /><br />Collins continues to leave the way her dystopia works to be quite vague. Also unknown are how things came to be this way.  We get a reason for the games in the first book, but no understanding of how Panem came to be the way it is, and how the Capitol can sustain such a lavish, high-tech lifestyle while the Districts (the ones we have seen) get by with only as much technology as they absolutely must have to do their tasks.  Nor are there any motivations for the Capitol and the President given, or even really hinted at; they are simply evil. Katniss doesn't change much, she was already a tough survivor type.  And Peeta is perhaps short-changed a tad by making him a bit too perfect.  Haymitch, on the other hand, gets some nice background and some more development.<br /><br />Plot-wise there are a number of surprises, especially early on, and a nice mounting sense of dread through the first half to two-thirds of the book, as Katniss feels increasingly trapped.  I am not wild about the romantic triangle business, but it does its job.  The end of the book features a twist that was pretty easy to see coming, so easy in fact I wonder if it was intended as a twist at all, despite the surprise our protagonist feels.<br /><br />There is considerable violence here, not as graphic as the first book (which was not really graphic either), but potentially disturbing for sensitive or younger readers. There's no sex (unless you count kissing, and I don't), though the nudity of one character is used to at least imply certain possible reactions (plumbing is not mentioned); however, it is played mostly for humor.<br /><br />I find myself drawn to these stories by their powerful emotional content. This is not something I normally look for in a book, but Collins has really done a nice job here.  If you like that sort of thing, you should enjoy Catching Fire.t change much, she was already a tough survivor type.  And Peeta is perhaps short-changed a tad by making him a bit too perfect.

B002LLDTA4|5.0|I own the VHS of the Isle of Wight concert, and am very much looking forward to this Blu-ray treatment, especially since it closely follows the London DVD of his current concert tour.  Leonard is 74 now, and as creative and productive as he's been during his long career, which began in the late '60s. It's a fitting paean to his great career - Cohen ranks as one of the most important and influential songwriters of the past 42 years - that these concert releases are coming out now.  Happily, my daughter and I are going to be seeing him live in Durham, North Carolina (USA) on 11/3 - a once in a lifetime experience.  For the uninitiated, the concert would likely serve as a useful sampler of his work, and provide a bookend to his most recent releases. For more, check out the Lian Lunson documentary/concert film from a few years ago, \\"Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man,\\" which features a long, segmented interview with Leonard interspersed with footage from an Australian tribute concert with some excellent performances.    Note: I rated this review without seeing it because Amazon would not let me post it unless I did.  I do, however, have high hopes.

B000V86OKG|5.0|Now his arch enemy is out, now he has killed and bled his own brother, though the real identity and even existence of this brother remains kind of schizophrenic more than real, Dexter can concentrate on the business at hand and how he can go on with his psychologically lucrative activity. But... That would be too simple. First his girl friend is a weak woman who has been made afraid of her own shadow by her very mother who invades her home after her own personal crisis, that of an uninspired school teacher who ends up hating the system she has served all her life because it cannot change when she is aging, when she becomes unable to stand young children and their disorganized way of discovering the world, life and knowledge. That mother is a bloodsucker for her own daughter and grandchildren. That leads to Dexter being careless and evoking his addiction, to death and killing of course, but his girl friend understands drugs, because of her own first husband, and she pushes him into some Narcotics Anonymous where he is absolutely vampirized by a British uncatchable praying manta that only wants to suck her men dry or dead or destroyed. That will lead to the worst dramatic events ever in this season. But that you will have to discover all by yourself like big boys and big girls. But the black sergeant of his department at the Miami Metropolitan PD is becoming more than suspicious. he tails him, he corners him, he provokes him, though he himself is not clean, with a couple of shootings that are at least suspicious, and the last one is frankly clear as plain morning sunshine. That leads to a conflict and that conflict will lead to the major bloody meat of this season. But once again, go and discover it by yourself and don't beg like puppies. It is great. The worst part for him is his inner voice that is telling him crazy things, and yet so sensible now he has bled his brother to death in front of his own eyes and with his own hands. This season is based on the idea that even Dexter can change. He sure can change. He has great difficulties killing for a while, drops one case, who is blind and can't recognize him, and fails with another case to finally succeed but out of, I my by sheer, luck more than real art. He starts doubting himself, and he is brought to thinking that his father actually committed suicide because he discovered that the monster he had trained was a real monster and not only some kind of dreamer. That leads to his own desire to end all that. But his carnivorous vampire friend of a British girl convinces him of something else, that he can actually become addicted to what she is addicted to, a minor addiction in his case, sex, and he does. But very fast he realizes she is only sucking his marrow out of his bones. But he can't get rid of her because she is destroying everything and everyone around him, including the children of his girl friend. She is an arsonist and she manages with  that great art of casting fire when necessary to capture his attention, then to liberate him of a great danger, but to make him afraid more than ever, and finally to prove him that if she cannot eat him slice by slice at her own speed and leisure she will spoil the meat for no one else to be able to approach it any more, and a few other people close to him will be toasted dry and brittle at the same time. The third problem is the FBI. It is a real problem with the first special agent who is FBI all right but careful and patient, and he falls in temporary love with Dexter's sister. But the second one, the first one's own boss, wants fast results at any cost and they satisfy themselves with the Bay Harbor Butcher the arsonist is serving them on a charred platter. That's good luck for Dexter. His worst perils and hazards turn out to be good charms. So his psychological dissolution is countered and reversed into some more positive conviction that there is a god for the serial killers of his code and that he has to go on, after getting rid of the British arsonist somewhere under the Eiffel Tower in Paris, of all possible places. So can he change? And the second season after many hesitations ends up with the same ideology as before: he cannot change, not because he was educated as a monster, but because deep in himself he has a divine soul that dictates his attitude and his action. He gets independent, free from his father because he is able to climb a few ladder rungs towards a more justified killing style and mode. He becomes some kind of archangel Michael or Gabriel who is killing the dragons of evil in the ailing heart of our society. In other words he is another Lestat de Lioncourt, a vampire by profession, and Anne Rice's darling creature and creation. The serial killer the social cereal that provides society with the fiber, the bran it needs to evacuate its clogged intestines. He is the purge of evil, in one word he is the future. And he has a future for sure. Third season coming soon. And will there be a fourth season soon too? A shame the DVD's bonuses did not include interviews of the important people on this series: Michael C. Hall for one and the director for another who has chosen the cool and slow style of a voice-over to tell us the story. There would be a lot to say about that schizophrenic means. But who is schizophrenic? Dexter or the director?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDf the British arsonist somewhere under the Eiffel Tower in Paris, of all possible places. So can he change?

Hall for one and the director for another who has chosen the cool and slow style of a voice-over to tell us the story. There would be a lot to say about that schizophrenic means. But who is schizophrenic? Dexter or the director?     Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID

B00111YM5G|5.0|This does give an insight as to how some angels could have become corrupted. For the Biblical purists, they will have to be open minded. But if you have even asked yourself how could Lucifer betray God and try to take over, this movie should be interesting to you. Helps to understand the concept of free will too.    It is a fictional story, but a good one!
0375805613|5.0|I love reading this book with my kids!  They get a kick out of Grover's response on each page and it's so easy to get them excited about!
B000A3VTT8|5.0|What a delight to see von Stade at her prime!  She is a charming Cinderella!  The production was very fine.
B001U0HBPG|3.0|It will remind you of Big (Tom Hanks) but I'm sure they don't want people thinking that so they switch up the storyline a bit, move it back 50 + years which allows for wardrobe that can Robert Redfordize Brad Pitt...I'm sure Hollywood wants to do that whenever they get the chance.      More along the lines of a chic flick, it was not as entertaining as it could have been if Benjamin was a bit more mischievious as he's been known to be in other movies.  It's one of those movies where the dialog drops to faint whispers so you have to crank up the volume all the way and get blown out of your seat when the scene changes to blasting music.  Okay Netflix, it's time to take down the pop-up ads for this movie that somehow creeps it's way past the pop-up blocker on every single website we've visited for the past 6 months!
B001AR0D4A|4.0|Some Stephen King stories have not transformed into film with any success.  (See Pet Semitary)  This horror spectacular has a lot more going for it than monsters and gore, although there is plenty of both.  King's stories succeed because they delve into characters' psychology, the critical part movies like Pet Semitary forget.  This film has a good memory.  The ending is tragically ironic, to say the least.  I recommend it.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Having first viewed this film in a theatre over 30 years ago (a Japanese film festival no less... so they had an \\"original\\", not export version), it is still up there in my top 10.    I really do not want to duplicate other praise for this MasterWork - Bernabo's review covers it so well.    However it is worth noting that if you needed any other reason to buy this film, it is the Criterion label.  In Australia at least, Laser Disc was a rarity - mostly caused by the unrelenting greed of the Studios - who would not import them for sale or rental - but attacked any video shop that tried to, with legal injunctions et al.  Suffice to say I was convinced by the owner of my local video hire, a collector of note and sagacity, to buy this title as a laser disc as it was a Criterion re-master - and the first \\"commercial\\" version of the full 3+ hour release.  I am guessing this is the base material that went to the DVD issue.    At any rate, it was a superb result - my only regret it was not put on a blu-ray disc (really only for the convenience...)but that is just being picky :-)
B001GMH8RO|5.0|Ghost is a love story that will haunt you long after you eject the disc from the player. The story of Sam and Molly's eternal love will rekindle the flames of romance even in the coldest of hearts. It is not a complex story by any means, but it is full of tender moments. Sam is murdered by a gangster on the instructions of his best friend Carl, who wants to get his hands on millions of dollars in an account handled by Sam at the bank they are working for.      Sam becomes a ghost, learns Carl's real intentions, finds a medium to communicate with Molly and save her. Sam's `life' as a ghost is shown in great detail - how he learns to go through and move physical objects is given special attention. Existence can be difficult, but never dull for a ghost, if Ghost is to be believed. An obvious bonus for the film makers was that they didn't have to spend much on Patrick Swayze's wardrobe - he's wearing the same red t-shirt for practically the entire film.   Ghost has special effects that were considered groundbreaking at the time. These could have been done more effectively today (especially the scenes of bad people being dragged to hell), but that does not take anything away from the effects of Ghost. But no one will remember Ghost for the effects - it is the elaborate romantic sequences that matter. Demi Moore's and Patrick Swayze's pottery scene (to the strains of \\"I hunger for your touch\\"), the coin-lifting scene which convinces Molly that Sam is `alive' and the romantic scene in the final moments when Sam uses Oda Mae's body to `touch and feel' Molly are all outstanding. The film is also a full-blown comedy in a way, with the verbal exchanges between Sam and Oda Mae being the highlight.   The acting is superb throughout. Moore and Swayze are the ideal couple. Their facial expressions tell you what love is all about. Tony Goldwyn is superb as the villainous `friend' Carl. Whoopi Goldberg as Oda Mae is nothing short of excellent - this film would not have been the samewithout her.  I remember one of her lines particularly well - \\"have a nice life, have a nice death, bye\\". While no one would mistake this film for a philosophical lesson on life and death, I did ponder the question `is there life after death ? '. The film makers have apparently drawn inspiration from numerous accounts of Near Death Experiences.            As for the blu-ray, it is a great presentation. It may not be up to the standards of latest day and date releases, but do bear in mind that this film is 20 years old.  It is the best presentation of Ghost I have seen this side of a D1 master, so one cannot complain. The sound too is very good. One more thing - apart from a few instances of swearing, there is no profanity here as far as I can remember.  This is a film that any film fan should have in his or her collection.
0316017922|4.0|From a layman's two cents worth - Outliers is a fine read for today's dedicated and driven individual.  I've shared this book with my psychologist, corporate attorney, mother, daughter and friends.  There are tidbits for all appetites and I personally enjoyed each anecdote.      My take away from the book that stays with me long afterward, is that perseverance is virtue and birthright is commonplace.  Aesop's fable of the tortoise and the hare is proved out in Gladwell's Outliers.  I am fortunate to have read this book.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|This series is a great show to watch about the storylines of Ghosts, Demons, Witches, Urban Legends, and with this season Angels the cast for the two brothers is right on for this show as well as they seem to connect as real brothers to make the show more entertaining as well.  The series is a nice cut away from the recent shows like CSI, NCIS, or Criminal Minds an the such as the main protagonists of this show aren't human criminals or murderers but supernatural spiritual enemies that you can't just shoot with a normal weapon or lock away in a normal prison and so the Winchester brothers must always come up with a mystical and sometimes unusual way to defeat their enemies.  This season will deal with the coming apocalypse and the introduction of powerful angels to join the fight this time, but as expected the brothers are highly dubious of these events since their time fighting demons an the such they have never encountered an angel before.  The show as with the other previous three seasons will be entertaining and leave you wanting for more especially with the cliffhanger of this seasons end.  The video like the rest of the season box sets is clear and sharp no distortions to worry about and the audio is great to,  the extras are some deleted scenes, a few gag reels, a documentary segment about the mythology of the afterlife more specifically Heaven and Hell, and a few commentaries on some episodes.  So if you're a fan of ghost movies or myths here's a great show for you and for fans who've already gotten the first three seasons like me rejoice as the fourth has arrived....

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Okay people, who cares if she does not sound like before.  I did not really care about her music before, but now she has a testimony to tell in the songs.. It is like the blues, but she got it all back.. Does it matter that she does not have the same voice, No!  She is still singing and I bought the CD and I have played her songs on repeat.    Sure, she sounds like some of the other tunes out there, but they did not have the testimony of restoration.  She did not commit suicide because she could not take it.. She lived to tell about.  God bless you Whitney....I am enjoying the heck out of your CD.
B000F9RB9Y|1.0|The movie, well, it's still great. This commentary is strictly on the BluRay version.<br /><br />Extras: Minimal<br /><br />Video Quality: Terrible. It looks like an old, damaged, partially burned film was used as the master. There are scratches, black marks - even jitters. More like a drive-in movie that was played 100 times too many. All that was redone was some of the text. The classic scene when Arnold stands up - in the left portion of the screen is this dancing black burn/scrape the size of a large rat moving up and down the screen.  When Kyle lands in the alley, it looks like there are coffee grounds on the lens.  It's that bad - seriously.  The only part (and I do mean part) that anyone took time on was Arnold's front nude scene when he walked towards the punks, seeking clothing. You clearly see said \\"part\\" dangling and bobbing. Nuf' said.<br /><br />The opening menu reminded me of some cheesy fan website. The button audio was 10x louder than the background audio. Each time I arrowed up or down, I thought I'd blow a speaker. Even the rendering was poor - too few frames, so it's jittery.  I picture someone at the studio yelling \\"Hey, I need an intern to learn BluRay mastering - here's some software, a video camera, some film and the keys to the screening room. Do me proud.\\"<br /><br />DVD quality: Well, the menu froze several times for around two seconds. The opening titles froze for a second.  The movie froze several times for a second or two.  I have a new, version 2 BluRay player and around 20 BluRay movies. This is the ONLY one this has happened on. This is a minimal quality, no frills (not even a one page insert), low-budget production.  To be honest, I think my DVD version is better (except for the audio.)<br /><br />Audio: Phenomenal. True 5.1 - the rumbles shake the rafters, gunfire and plasma rifle lovers can rejoice.  Arnold's stoic accent thunders.<br /><br />Skip it.
B002GOSA82|5.0|I discovered Riverside a few years ago and they now might be my second favorite band (I don't think anyone will ever top Tool).  All of their records are excellent.  Great musicianship and lyrics.  This record took a bit to grow on me, which isn't unusual for songs of this length.  But I'm now convinced that this is their best yet.  The song structures are amazing.  Left Out is an emotional song to me.  It stands out in a record of 5 brilliant songs.  If you are interested in this at all, buy it.  Listen several times.  You won't be disappointed.  (And if you haven't checked out Lunatic Soul yet, go there next. Great side project.)

0312995423|3.0|Having read 'Digital Fortress', after having the 'Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons', Dan Brown's plot strategies are all too easy to recognise.  A catastrophic disaster, the race against time, absurdly difficult puzzles to solve, the handsome man and gorgeous woman who team up to save the day, both of emeritus intelligence and who share a physical chemistry, the shadowy assasin with eyes like coal who has a physical ailment (deaf, albino, etc) and progressively kills those who pose a threat, the insider leading the operation to save the day who is eventually exposed as the villain, I could go on, but I won't.  It is for this reason that it gets 3 stars - it's finally worn a bit thin. That said, I think Dan Brown writes suspense extremely well and though I knew more or less what to expect, it was still fairly enjoyable.  Those who've reviewed DF complaining about the real-world accuracy of Brown's writing concerning all matters technology, why the high blood pressure?  I myself am a computing professional and I've long since learned to treat a work of fiction as a work of fiction, and enjoy it for exactly what it is. Jeff Goldblum disabled the aliens shields in 'Independence Day' by writing a virus in a couple of minutes and uploading it using an Apple Mac! If you don't learn to suspend reality and have a chuckle at these things, then you'll probably end up six feet under well before your time.  If you want a work of absolute genius to read, try 'Enders Game' by Orson Scott Card.

B001FB4VZS|3.0|What HAPPENED?!  More and more this show is starting to slip down my list of faviorte TV shows.  Every ones knows this show is about Clarks journey to ultimately become Superman but there are a few problems that has always bugged me.<br /><br />Why doesnt Clark where glasses? (I understand he didnt wear them until he began working at the Daily Planet but he is working there now!)  By the way, what the heck does he do there!  He never reports on anything!<br /><br />Why does Louis know who he is?  They should have kept her away from the show until the final season!<br /><br />Why hasnt Clark flown yet! (Is it a budget issue?  I sometimes compare this show to NBCs Heroes...there are some cool flying effects there)  May be NBC has more money?<br /><br />Please no more Lana and Chloe love twists!  How many times do we need to see them live/die/love triangle!<br /><br />On the positive side, the story is starting to pick up...maybe because the show is on its last legs (it has now move to its new home on Fridays).  Everyone know, Fridays is the death of tv.
B0001LYH98|5.0|This CD is not typical Bowie. It's emotional and contemplative, and it touches on more serious themes than many of his songs. A lot of the songs are melancholy and laced with regret. The lyrics and melody are memorable, and one would not normally hear them played in a dance club. If you want to see this side of Bowie, then buy this CD. Personally, I think it's wonderful.

0439023491|5.0|First you should know that I am biased, Katniss and I are too much alike to make this a fair review.  A smart, athletic, sarcastic, hot-tempered heroine who is fiercely independent is not an easy combination to come by in YA Sci-Fi. I may not actually be those things, but at least I like to believe I am.  However, that is not all that makes this story.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen and her fellow tribute Peeta Mellark have just won the Hunger Games and are now beginning their tour visiting with all the other districts in Panem. Before they can begin their tour though, Katniss is visited by a very angry President Snow. Snow doesn't believe that Katniss and Peeta acted out of love at the end of the Hunger Games, and the Capitol doesn't do rebellion. Unfortunately for Katniss she has now become the face of just that, rebellion among the districts.<br /><br />Snow makes Katniss a promise that she will pay for what she has done with the lives of those she loves if she doesn't do something to smother the spark of an uprising, she must keep it from \\"Catching Fire\\". The only way to do this, according to Snow, is by convincing all of Panem and Snow himself that she truly had acted out of undying love for Peeta at the last hunger games.  With the promise that their families will suffer if they fail and the upcoming Quarter Quell, the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta are struggling to keep up.<br /><br />Catching Fire is just as fast paced as The Hunger Games. However, Katniss is much more fierce in this book. Defending the ones she loves brings out the fighter in her that wasn't there in the first book. Where she shied away from confrontation in the Hunger Games, Katniss dives in head first in Catching fire with only the thought of saving the people she loves the most.<br /><br />If the action in Catching fire isn't enough to quench your thirst, then the love story will make up for it.  Peeta Mellark is still as wonderful as ever, doing everything in his power to keep Katniss safe and to make her happy, even if happy isn't with him. Gale also makes a much more pronounced entrance into this book, showing the reader much more of his personality, and showing Katniss much more of his true feelings.<br /><br />This book has it all, love, struggle, action, violence, conflict, triumph, sadness, and the promise of a fantastic end to the trilogy.  The cliffhanger end is enough to drive me mad for the next year, and I would recommend it to anyone whether they love YA Sci-Fi or not.power to keep Katniss safe and to make her happy, even if happy isn't with him.

B001GCUO4I|4.0|The Final Destination: Movie Review<br /><br />Grade: B<br /><br />For my first 3-D movie experience in theaters I picked none other than The Final Destination, despite not really liking the only other film in the series that I had seen, [[ASIN:B000FC2HS6 Final Destination 3 (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. The kills to me weren't executed well to me, and overall, it really just failed to impress me. That's were The Final Destination improves: the kills, though a little too coincidental and predictable for my taste, are fun to watch and imaginative, especially in full and vibrant Real-D 3-D.<br /><br />By now just about everyone walking into the movie knows the series' mythology, and that it's basically about finding inventive and cool ways to kill off annoying and stereotypical people, so I won't waste really waste much time there: After a group of twentysomethings (Actually, the audience never really knows; there is no character development whatsoever) escape from a fiery racetrack explosion, death finds ways of getting them back, whether it's via escalator, car washes, ambulances, or bathtubs. Like I said before: coincidental, but oh so fun to watch.<br /><br />So yes, the only saving grace is the 3-D, but fear not: The Final Destination will still always entertain you, whether its flinging body parts at you, throwing tools in your way, or just plain out painting you, and the town, a bright red.
B00284BNKC|5.0|It's as if Darren Aronofsky filmed your very own worst nightmare, assuming you had anything to do with drugs or drug addicts.  If ever a viewer wondered about the interior state of being of drug addiction, this is the movie for you. Aronofsky used Hubert Selby Jr.'s book and screenplay as his source material and the source material is brilliant.<br /><br />I love movies which explore surreal states.  This must come in part from my fascination with surrealist art. Aronofsky's film probably owes more to the late Salvador Dali than to any other film director. I'm also fascinated by movies which move as if you were viewing them in a dream state.  We do spend a great deal of our lives in a dream state and see life from an entirely different perspective in REM time. Aronofsky seems to understand this very well. Aronofsky and Selby, in intended irony, load their characters with dreams of their own which are destined to remain unfilled in large part because of their drug addictions.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn plays the easiest addict to understand and she does her usual masterful job.  She wants to lose weight so takes diet pills (speed) to do so.  Her dream is to be on tv which is what spurs her to the speed. Her son Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyrone use the outright illegal street drugs and dream of becoming big drug dealers instead of low level pushers.  On the way to drug fortune, they themselves become addicted.<br /><br />Jared Leto as the son Harry Goldfarb does a first rate acting job.  Frankly, prior to this role, I didn't think he had any acting talent. There is a growing problem with his injection infected arm which will remain visually with you long after the movie is over. Jennifer Connelly as Marion Silver is every bit as wonderful as Burstyn in this film. She is Harry's girlfriend, soon to enter a life of degradation due to the nightmarish descent into drugs.<br /><br />Because this film is so visual, it is an ideal one for seeing in the best possible format available.

B0018YIW4S|5.0|UFO was always a bigger hit in Europe and the UK than in the States, where they've really not had much more than a cult following. Their studio albums leading up to Strangers were good, solid hard rock with above-average song writing and skilled instrumental abilities.<br /><br />But wow! On stage, they made a quantum leap in terms of added edge and fire to their performance. And anyone who is a guitar player or a fan of melodic rock guitar must, and I mean MUST, hear this. Schenker is simply mind-boggling and these performances are worth hearing for his solos alone. Unlike later 80's shred-meisters who became obsessed with maximizing notes-per-minute quotient, Schenker, somewhat like Buck Dharma, always put an emphasis on carefully structuring his solos with great tone, feel, and melodic focus. In this live setting, this comes out with even greater fire and power.<br /><br />Add to this the facts that the whole band plays great and the song selection cherry-picks the best of UFO's catalog to that point, and you have the recipe for one of the best hard rock live albums ever. If you're not familiar with UFO. but enjoy hard rock esp. hard rock from the 1970's, you'll drop this disc on and say &quot;Who are these guys and why haven't I heard them 'til now?&quot;
0439023491|5.0|\\"On the seventy-fifth anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol...\\"<br /><br />Ever since she pulled those berries out in the last minutes of the previous year's Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen has become an icon of defiance and rebellion to the Districts. She knows that the leaders in the Capitol are not happy that she outsmarted their plans, forcing them to accept two victors and saving her fellow tribute Peeta in the process. But she is unaware of the extent of their ire until she receives an unexpected visit from President Snow, complete with a death threat against Gale's life should she fail to quell the rising spirit of rebellion in the Districts.<br /><br />Meanwhile, President Snow has his own plans to quash any inklings of revolution, and they happen to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games--also known as the Quarter Quell. As in the two previous Quells (taking place on the 25th and 50th anniversary respectively) the rules of the Games have been altered for the year to remind the Districts that even the annual massacre of their children in the regular games is not enough to atone for their previous attempt at insurgency. But what the Capitol has cooked up for the new Games results in something that nobody could have predicted, not even President Snow himself.<br /><br />After reading the Hunger Games and being completely enthralled by the world that Suzanne Collins painted with her words, I was worried that Catching Fire might not be able to hold up to the high standard that the Hunger Games set. And while I did feel that some of the page-to-page action and detail suffered by comparison, it is more than made up for by the sharp upswing in overarching plot and the many twists that never failed to take me by surprise and made me wonder out loud: how did she think of that?! The love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale had me on the edge of me seat wondering who she was going to choose, whether it would be by choice or necessity, and who I would choose if I were in her shoes (definitely Peeta! Sorry, Gale.) In my opinion, it was not as polished or smooth a read as the Hunger Games. At the same time, however, I must acknowledge that the focus was entirely different from the first book, with a far more complex and ambitious plot, and I truly applaud Collins' creativity and ingenuity in weaving the bigger picture of corruption, manipulation, and rebellion within an entire nation into the same captivating first-person narrative of survival that made the Hunger Games such as success. I really enjoyed Catching Fire and cannot wait to get my hands on the third book to see what finally happens to our rebels.was going to choose, whether it would be by choice or necessity, and who I would choose if I were in her shoes (definitely Peeta!

1416914307|1.0|As a reader, I really enjoy getting involved with the characters and obviously a good plot is essential to showing off a great set of characters. That being said... I could see the plot \\"twists\\" a mile away. Furthermore, they weren't pulled off very convincingly so I was left questioning whether the characters were so completely self absorbed that they'd miss the obvious. And they are. Maybe I'm too old to enjoy this type of book anymore but I highly doubt that because I've read other young adult paranormal romances that left me with a good feeling after reading them even though I could pretty much figure out where things were going.  I'd recommend reading novels by Patricia Briggs for those interested vampires and werewolves or Steven Brust if you're a guy and like things edgier.    People, you have options! You don't have to read this book.
B002CLBJPK|4.0|\\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" (1971) was a favorite of mine when I first saw it. The idea of being able to transport yourself anywhere by turning the knob at the foot of a bed was extremely appealing! Although many watching this film might think it is very similar to [[ASIN:B001JRB16U Mary Poppins (45th Anniversary Special Edition)]] it was in development before \\"Poppins\\" was ever released. An intially lackluster treatment caused Walt to put it on the shelf and proceed with \\"Poppins\\" instead. After Walt's passing, the Disney team dusted it off and put together the film that you see now. A very charming story set during World War II, it still stands up today. Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury) is a single woman studying to be a witch. She receives her lessons through mail from a conman, Professor Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson). At the same time, she becomes saddled with 3 young war orphans who throw a wrench in her ordered life. Through a lucky accident, Browne inadvertently sends Price a magical text which is missing the second half. Seeking Browne out, she and the children go on a magical adventure to discover the complete magical spells located in the 2nd book which can help England during the war.<br /><br />There have been a number of DVD releases for the Disney Classic \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\"; this particular one seems to be aimed at the young teen market. The movie itself is the same restored version from the [[ASIN:B00004R9A4 Bedknobs and Broomsticks (30th Anniversary Edition)]]. There are a few differences between the sets: this Enchanted Musical Edition contains a featurette hosted by Jennifer Stone from [[ASIN:B0018CWEU8 Wizards of Waverly Place: Wizard School]] (8:07) which describes how animation and live action were combined when \\"Bedknobs\\" was made and how it is done digitally with a green screen effect today. Stone is very enthusiastic and the tone of this background featurette is clearly aimed at a more youthful demographic. Both DVD sets have the featurette, \\"Music Magic - The Sherman Brothers\\" which details the music in the movie. It is a little sad to hear the brothers discuss how after Walt died, many at the studio didn't know what to do and found it hard to believe things could continue on. From this feeling came the song \\"The Age of Not Believing.\\" Unfortunately for this new edition, the featurette has been trimmed; on the 30th edition, it delves a little deeper into the restoration of the missing footage that was cut after the initial release of the film. Whether this would be interesting or not to today's youth is debatable. The version also has a Dylan & Cole Sprouse promo \\"Blu-Ray is Suite\\" (4:44) which shows many of the benefits to owning a blu-ray vs. regular DVD. Again, definite appeal to the youth who follow the Disney Channel's [[ASIN:B0015XWUB8 The Suite Life of Zack and Cody: Lip Synchin' in the Rain]] Missing from the 30th release are a few Donald Duck & Mickey Mouse cartoons.<br /><br />Additional bonus features on this set:<br /><br />-\\"A Step in the Right Direction\\" Reconstruction (3:48): By using stills (since the footage is still lost), Disney attempts to recreate the missing Angela Lansbury musical number. Charming number, but not a huge loss as far as the impact of the film is concerned.<br /><br />-\\"David Tomlinson \\"Portobello Road\\" recording session (1:10): See actor Tomlinson recording the vocal tracks for this musical number.<br /><br />-Theatrical Trailers: 4 trailers of varying length, from 1:33 to 3:42<br /><br />Overall, a solid release. If you are more into \\"old\\" Disney you might enjoy the previous edition better with the vintage cartoons and expanded behind-the-scenes Sherman featurette. Kids of today will probably prefer this edition which has a little more zest thanks to the Disney Channel stars of today. You can't go wrong with either edition though as the movie itself is the same, looking and sounding spectacular with the majority of the deleted footage reinstated (makingit approximately 139 minutes).<br /><br />Specs: Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound / Widescreen (1.66:1 - Enhanced for 16x9 TVs) / French Language Track / French & Spanish subtitlesDigital 5.1 Surround Sound / Widescreen (1.66:1 - Enhanced for 16x9 TVs) / French Language Track / French & Spanish subtitles

B002EBDP9G|4.0|I really liked this book. I would have liked it more without the format issues (especially when it comes to numbers, such as dates and figures!) which really had me doing a lot of double backing to make sure he meant what I had just read. This is a problem throughout the entire Kindle version of the book because of the date of relevant events and birth/death dates, but especially once he gets into the late 19, early 20th century, and starts throwing around productions comparisons with increasing regularity.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book moved quickly and pretty cleanly, he had his references (which I am not going to double check, so let's assume they are correct) and his admitted honesty in being a conservative author from the get-go, which prepared me for some of the tangents he took regarding a number of events in the last 400 years. Even if you disagree with his reasoning and conclusions, he put forth adequate and honest arguments for them.<br /><br />Mr. Johnson's history is not just one of politics -- it covers the gambit, with a good deal of time and effort devoted to explaining how all aspects of American life developed, and what made it different then the rest of the world. This includes quite a bit on non-political events and people, and how they effected the American way of life, and how THEY effected yet other people, which is further explained, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />A pretty good book. Buy it after they fix the format issues. :)

B0006399FS|4.0|'Atomic Bomb' continues the trend of U2's previous album, in stripping away the electronic and dance influences from their 90's work in favour of a more straightforward rock sound. Here, they strip away pretty much everything that defined their sound from 'Achtung Baby' onwards, resulting in an album as direct and straightforward as 'Boy' or 'War'. On one hand, this might disappoint those fans who appreciate the more experimental side of the band. However, U2 still sound strong and energetic on 'Atomic Bomb', and there are enough subtle twists to keep the album interesting.     Fans of old-school U2 will find plenty to love here: standard U2 rockers such as 'Miracle Drug', 'City of Blinding Lights', 'Crumbs From Your Table', 'Original of the Species' and 'Yahweh', plus the emotional ballad 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own', will please long-time fans. Not exactly breaking bold new artistic ground, but the songs all have strong melodies and hooks, plus huge choruses.     The four departures from the standard U2 sound are:     'Love and Peace or Else', a compressed, heavy rocker that's a bit reminiscent of 'Bullet the Blue Sky'.   'One Step Closer', a very subdued, keyboard-tinged ballad   'A Man and A Woman', an acoustic pop piece similar to 'Wild Honey'   'All Because of You', driving rocker that's probably the closest U2 have ever come to let-it-all-hang-out rock.     The best aspect of this album is the consistency. There aren't many obvious standout singles, but there are no real weak songs either, although I must say 'Vertigo' is a bit clumsy. And while the album is very immediate, the production contains enough things lurking under the surface (buried keyboards and acoustics, subtle production effects) that keep the album interesting on repeated listens.    It's not a groundbreaking artistic masterpiece in the mould of `Achtung Baby', but so what? The band sounds in top form, and effortlessly turn out one of their most direct, powerful albums.    Four stars.
0446402389|4.0|Fans of the thriller/suspense genre, I hope you're prepared to be floored by this novel.    \\"Since Maria had decided to die her cat would have to fend for itself,\\" is one of the best first lines in all of literature.     Here's an example of the novels fierceness. I was in the Borders Book Store and recommended Child 44 to a woman browsing the thriller section. She read the first line and said: \\"Wow, now that's a great opening line,\\" or something to that effect.    There's no doubt that Smith's experience working on a drama series helped him maintain an extremely high level of suspense throughout this book. Almost every single chapter offers a \\"gold coin,\\" or a surprise. And not just any surprise, I'm talking surprises that would have you gasping out loud. There is tension on every line.     The characters are well drawn. Both the leading characters, Leo and Raisa, change completely throughout the novel. I won't tell you how. You'll have to read the novel to find out; no spoilers here.     And you will learn so much about Stalinist Russia, in a fun way. It will, in no way shape or form seem like you're reading a textbook. The information is revealed in context, i.e., through the situations that the characters in the novel find themselves in. Surely, you'll see the full breath of how cruel and demonic communist Russia was in the 1950s, how hypocritical the system was. All for the State, but yet the State won't protect you, it won't feed you, it will work you to death, and if you complain, oh, for heaven's sake, you must be an enemy of the State. No wonder communism failed.     Just a great novel. Read it, you'll love it. One of the best novels I've read all year. And I've been reading Mario Puzo, Richard Yates, Dennis Lehane, Ralph Ellison, Haper Lee. So this novel is in great company.     I'm jealous I didn't write the novel myself.     Surely, on the one-star ratings given below, you will see people, with Slavic last names, trashing this novel.  Surely they may have lived in Russia, based on their comments. But this is not a non-fiction book, so the details do not need to be 100% precise. It's called FICTION!!! Hello!     Then there were those complaining about the grammar. Some people are just moronically obsessed with grammar. I've tried to read Toni Morrison's Beloved and couldn't get through the first 50 pages because I thought the poetic license she took with her prose just made the reading experience trying and difficult. However, Smith's writing is smoother and goes down like good wine. Sure there are some confusing spots, but to go so far as to say the grammar was bad, and where was the editor?, please, let's not exaggerate people.     Some complained the writing was flat. Are you kidding me?  What planet are they living on?  (I guess Smith's writing wasn't flowery enough for them.) It's obvious that Smith was more concerned about the story than trying to impress people with flowery writing that more often than not turns out to be confusing and not exactly smelling of flowers, if you get my drift.

0061649694|4.0|Coraline Jones, ignored, unappreciated and outright bored, lives in a house with a crazy old man who trains rats in the flat above her, and a pair of retired actresses and their dog in the flat below her. In her flat there is a most wondrous door, which leads to nowhere, except at night, when it leads to a whole other world built just for her.<br /><br />By now between the book and the movie, you've probably heard of it, if not seen or read it. But for those who haven't met Coraline and her creepy, button-eyed other mother there's a few things they should know.<br /><br />Coraline isn't Gaiman's best work, or the prettiest as far as story or prose goes. What it is is incredibly imaginative and unlike any other scary kids book out there. The stand out element isn't the true bizarreness, but Coraline herself, strong, courageous and most importantly a very smart little girl.<br /><br />This book is as much about how a child deals with the bad things in life as it is about parental abandonment or the scary things that go bump in the night. Like the Harry Potter series faces themes of losing the people you love, Coraline contains a subtle, encouraging message about being strong, fierce and bringing your own bravery into all the challenges you face.<br /><br />For this reason alone it's a must-have addition to any child or child-oriented library. The other elements just add to the experience, making Coraline a potential children's classic for years to come.
B001C4CI8U|2.0|I watched the first 6 or 7 episodes.  The premiere was a knockout, but it gradually slid down from there.  I disagree that Anna Torv as Olivia is the show's weakest link.  If anything, Torv brings dramatic weight and intelligence to her role, despite her nebulous accent.  There was originally some great tension between her character and Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), but that evaporated quickly.  Now Peter has the all the personality of drying paint.  As for Walter Bishop, he also started out with potential, and now comes across as comic relief where none is needed.  He's dangerously close to being as annoying as Dr. Smith, who turned \\"Lost in Space\\" into a farce.  None of the characters have any life outside of their endless string of bizarre adventures.  And as for the whole topic of fringe \\"science\\", this show is about as scientifically-based as baking chocolate chip cookies.  At least I'm glad I wised-up before I spent a lotta $$$ on the boxed set.

0553582461|2.0|Overall impression is one big disappointment.  The whole trilogy left a feeling of the bloated fourth volume of The Farseer Trilogy where all loose ends are being tied up. Although, it is done very ungratefully.    !!!WARNING!!! SPOILERS    Fitz & Molly reunion plus 7 kids bonus is very artificial and out of context. 16 Years is not 16 months. They would be totally different people regardless of what happened within this period. Let alone vast life experience that affected both of them.  Fool...my personal disappointment here. I hoped that Fitz is going to realise that Fool is a woman and They Live Happily Ever After with a sense of wonder about each other and respect and exciting life...  On top of this the usual numerous repetitions of what happened only a hundred pages before.    The Tawny Man trilogy is a big let down.  Hobb was at the top 5 of my favourite writers since 2002, it is very sad to lose her now.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|A blood spattered Smiley-face button kisses the street following the pavement plastering of its owner. Is he one of the superheroes so revered from the \\"Watchmen\\" comic book? Do comic book superheroes die like this? I thought not. Questions such as these are quite apropos for someone like me who can't remember flipping a single page from this genre of literature. Theretofore, it must be duly noted that this production, adapted from Alan Moore's classic graphic novel is anti-typically at odds with your everyday blue-collar superhero, however; this is the principle ingredient which makes it so memorably special.    Considering that Watchmen tip-toes off the celestial heels of the most successful comic book film \\"The Dark Knight,\\" I sincerely had my doubts of its capableness. \\"Tip-toes,\\" dare I say? No...it catapults and soars within the stratosphere of The Dark Knight, and should be saluted akin to this decorated four-star general.    The story circles the lives of six satirical neophytes; unlikely crime fighters that pick up where an initial post World War II band leaves off in the late 60's - early 70's. Even superheroes aren't immune to the effects of time, so it is this new group upon which the central plot revolves. Unfortunately, their time and effort is short lived when the \\"Keene Act\\" bill is passed by Congress in 1977, banning costumed crime fighting or masked vigilantes.    Whimsically, skip forward to 1985, Nixon in his third term of presidency, and the remnant of all their inspirational gallantry has trickled down to mere common recollection.  Ordinarily, this circumstance wouldn't be so austere, but the majority of these 'recollections' are filled with petulance and indifference, while a nuclear holocaust is at large.    Jackie Earle Haley adeptly plays the psychoneurotic inkblot-masked man, Rorschach. Intrinsically, the shifting Guernsey-mask is `his face.' He is the one `super member', who remains dedicated to his political convictions, detesting both communists and liberals. Lines are never blurred, but, always crossed with his mindset. During an argument with Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Rorschach summarizes his stance on evil; \\"Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon. That's always been the difference between us.\\" Embedded at the forefront of the tangled plot, Rorschach's contributions are immense. Why does Nixon not absolutely adore this guy? Come winter, Hayley should be adored with yet another \\"Oscar-worthy\\" Best Supporting Actor nomination. He's that uncompromisingly good.    A complicated love saga involves the aforementioned Nite Owl II, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), and Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman). Dr. Manhattan, the lone superhero with true superhuman powers, is the apple of Nixon's political eye. He and the sexy long-legged Silk Spectre II are subsidized by the government to prevent national threats and crisis, and live together on a military base. But when Manhattan disappears to Mars, her subsidy disappears with him, so she begins co-habitating with Dan, a.k.a. Nite Owl II. Her ambivalent feelings towards Manhattan create some imposingly erotic moments between her and Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson); notably one set to Leonard Cohen's moody \\"Hallelujah.\\" Wilson and Ms. Akerman play their roles with pizzazz and a sultry sort of jazz. Crudup shines as the detached and reluctant \\"savior.\\" 'Shine' is the proper verb to describe Dr. Manhattan, being that he also resembles blue halogen on HGH. It's not his fault.    Rounding out the disjointed crew includes \\"The Comedian\\" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), \\"Adrien\\" Veidt, a.k.a. Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), not to mention Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre II's mother, \\"Silk Spectre I.\\" The Comedian, a.k.a. Edward Blake; a very intriguing charter member of the club for the most part appears in flashbacks. There's a worthy explanation for this, which I don't care to spoil. He dawns a very cynical and mischievous observation on crime fighting and life in the 80's. Speaking with Dan Dreiberg a.k.a. Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), in answering his question, \\"What happened to us? What happened to the American Dream?\\" The Comedian retorts with conviction, \\"What happened to the American Dream? It came true! You're lookin' at it...\\" And as Bob Dylan chimes away in his philosophical song of reveille, \\"Then you better start swimmin'...or you'll sink like a stone...for the times they are a-changin'. Contrary to The Comedian's ulterior belief, it's not \\"all a joke.\\" Jeffrey Dean Morgan is consummately cast for this conflicted persona.     Now retired, Gugino's character, Silk Spectre I adds a pleasant aroma to the entire spicy mix...very integral to the story. Whereas Spectre II (Malin Akerman) packs a fervent visual punch in her dominatrix ensemble, it is my estimation that Spectre I exudes the indelible attitude.    Directed by Zach Snyder of \\"300\\" infamy, Watchmen is also a visually stunning acclamation. The kaleidoscopic contours alone make the hairs on forearms rise to attention. Mine surely did. The sound effects are superb, especially during the pugilistic scenes, of which there are many.    No...I can't remember flipping a page of any comic book in my lifetime, and as long as momentous films like \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"Watchmen\\" continue infiltrating theatres, the thought should never come to mind. In other words, the prevailing narrative and perceptive illustrations, add so much to the integral mechanics, that a 'must-read' of Alan Moore's graphic novel may simply be considered an afterthought.

That nearly happened to me..it didn't sound like my kind of book; it sounds silly and flighty. I guess it was seeing the best-seller listing and the fact that on my Kindle I can read a sample without buying the book that saved me from missing out on this gem.
B002E2QHBS|2.0|Shame, this is one of my first \\"major\\" box sets I've ordered online and it arrived with a cracked spine on BOTH sides. Like someone in the stock-room was paying football with it. Definitely not the posties problem as the packaging itself was safe n' secure. In terms of the insides, quite precious material of course. But for a cool collectible, packaging is crucial and to arrive in sad shape soured my shopping experience. Next up on my list is the Neil Young + Beatles box sets. Who knows how they'll arrive? I'll probably just run to HMV or Best Buy so I can approve the packaging FIRST.

I don't even think I'm going to want to loan it out (except to super close friends).<br /><br />I am practically swooning over the ending and I ran right out to check out Simone's other books (they don't have them on the shelf at Borders, I checked, I'm so impatient).<br /><br />Anyway, if you love romantic stories, where the hero and heroine have some hurdles to true love, than this is the book for you.

B002M5ZCEU|2.0|True, as another reviewer stated, \\"If you're not looking for the old, it'll be easy to embrace the new\\", but unfortunately its the old that makes most of us want to hear the \\"new\\" and the new in respect to the old is a let down.  To add insult to injury however the new on it's own is just not good.  Whitney's voice, her signature for all intents and purposes, has been shredded by abuses we're all well aware of leaving us with hardly a shred of what made her the star she was or the vocal stand-out she exploited for drug money.  Initially the album, which is loaded with songs that fall flat after only a few listens, seems to be creatively influenced by neo-soul and neo-disco but a more critical listen reveals that the arrangements and rhythms are nothing more than superficially decorated standard contemporary R&B, relying more on production and presentation over emotional expression and thoughtful utilization of Whitney's former gift.  This revelation only further demonstrates the reality of her now more mediocre vocal capabilities because lets face it, if her voice were anywhere near what it used to be it would be utilized and highlighted, but it's not.  Her performances effect is marginal and the producers attempt to make up for this by using lame cookie cutter tracks to deceptively highlight her vocal performance.  It doesn't work; it makes the record forgettable on all levels.  So, why forget about the old to appreciate the new when in fact the people who made this record, rather than creating something genuinely new, original, and fitting for the real, and current Whitney Houston, have attempted to present listeners with the old in a pseudo new & manipulative package.  Bad.

B0010X745K|5.0|Simply excellent for those that like these type movies....even if you dont like these type movies, you may still love it......<br /><br />Simply superb.<br /><br />For those that did not care for the ending all I can say is the ending is what made this film a 5 star instead of a 4 star.<br /><br />This is not a 'happy movie'.....It was not suppsed to have a 'happy' ending. What if they had not had that ending and instead the gas runs out or they keep driving until they clear the mist and then see the army and all the people and they are saved?<br /><br />An ending like that would have left most sort of dangling in the ind not really sure what to make of it.....<br /><br />Some questioned why they 'fought so hard to survive but then gave up at the very end'....Folks, that is what made this movie a 5 star movie. Yes, they did fight hard to survive and that is what makes the ending STUNNING...it made the entire movie!<br /><br />Think of the irony in that they did fight hard but finally realized they were better off dying on their terms rather then in some horrible way. I would do the same to my son if my choices were to put a bullet in his head or let him die a ghastly and painful death.<br /><br />Then after killing everybody and with no more bullets, he decides to let the 'monsters in the mist' kill him...only to see if he had waited 5 more minutes, the world was saved and there was no reason to kill themselves. Imagine the horror the dad must have felt...<br /><br />That is what they wanted in this movie....A stunningly dramatic ending that fit the tone of the movie and that is exactly what we got......A better ending then the book, although I still liked the book and certainly a far better ending then if they were all saved.<br /><br />It was the perfect ending to a film of this type......a happy ending would not have fit and I for one was thrilled with the ending as not many films end and make you go \\"WOW...IF ONLY\\".....<br /><br />SUPERB MOVIE!! SUPERB ENDING!!!
B000000XB9|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival made so much good music that they could never put all their best hits on just a single CD; their fans will be happy to know that there's a second Chronicle CD with hits as well as quite a few more CDs of their tunes to boot! John Fogarty's vocals are never less than perfect--and wow, how he could write a song! Creedence Clearwater Revival performed with a style and a sound all their own; and their music sounds just as good today as it did when it was originally released. In addition, the quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and that artwork is very well done.<br /><br />\\"Susie Q\\" starts the album with a great number; these guys do this without ever missing a beat! The music is great for dancing or listening even today; and that's terrific!

B001XJEKGC|4.0|I'm a life-long Clapton fan and was thrilled to see him get back together with Steve Winwood for these shows. The musicianship is obvious and the respect and friendship these two have is genuine. The quality of the recording, in both sight and sound, is excellent. That said, I felt disappointed that they were not a bit more ambitious in the songs they chose, from their collective catalogue and their individual careers. I didn't see the type of improvisation and risk taking for which I had hoped. It's a fine documentation of these two great artists, and for fans like me it's a must-have. However, in the end I felt they could have challenged themselves more.
0307269981|5.0|This is the extraodinary second novel in the Millenium series by Larsson. To really understand what is going on and why you need to read the Girl who Played with Fire. This second novel is just as explosive as the first, and I am really hanging out for the final book in the series. While this book is not without one minor flaw (in my opiion) in the plot, it is so well written and with such a powerful theme that it flows easily to a stunning conclusion.<br /><br />Mikhail Blomquist, journalist and publisher has hired an independent writer who has an explosive story he is going to sell to the magazine, but suddenly he and his girlfriend are found shot to death in their apartment. There is a gun on the stairs with fingerprints on it. These belong to Lisbeth Solander - one time lover and partner of Blomquist, and a singular child like woman. She had been committed to children's homes in the past for her anti-social behaviour and violence, and had been committed by the court to be permanantly monitered. When the gun is found to belong to her appointed guardian and he is found dead - shot as well in his apartment. All evidence points to Solander.<br /><br />However Solander has gone to ground, as only she can. She is the master of computers, hacking, and of disguise. She has other identities to live under, and has been. She is also able to hack into various computers to find out what the investigation against her is up to and what leads they have.<br /><br />Blomquist has been unable to contact Solander for 2 years, and he doesn't understand why. She suddenly cut off contact, however knowing her from the past he knows that she is not capable of the crimes, the one thing that Solander really hates is Men who hate women. She wouldn't shoot the journalist who was writing to expose that crime.<br /><br />Independently Blomquist sets off to investigate the crimes, to find Solander and to help her.<br /><br />It turns out that Solander has made a number of friends in the past as well as some enemies and it seems everyone is determined to find her. One of the most hilarious scenes in this is when the two members of the motorcycle gang do find her, alone, in an isolated cabin.<br /><br />The only minor flaws I found in the book is the fact that in the past Solander has been touted as the person who can find out all kinds of information on the internet, including a lot of other stuff that isn't there. Yet she never found the link between her guardian and the people in this book? Also, she vows revenge on the men who were responsible for her incarceration, or at least says she will kill them - so why didn't she? Why didn't she wreck their lives like she could easily do? Like I said, these were minor flaws which didn't really affect the reading of the novel. I am interested if there are any comments from others on this.<br /><br />I still give this book a 5 because it is such a fabulous read and so well written. I am definitely going to be buying the last book in the trilogy as soon as it comes out.ryone is determined to find her.

B00005JLD4|4.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is a movie about the struggles of three racially mixed sisters, known as half castes.  The girls were born to pure Australian Aborigine mothers in the northern territory of Jigalong.  During the early to mid 20th centaury Australia had policies which forced the Aborigine to assimilate into western culture.  These polices where mostly aimed at the half-castes in an effort to prevent the formation of a new race.   The three girls are removed from their mother's custody, and placed into a Catholic orphanage where they would be taught the duties and responsibilities they would need to be efficient workers.  They were forbidden to speak their native tongue and taught to worship the Christian god and saints.  In the story the girls decide to walk back to their home, a 9 week journey through the Australian bush, while evading a tracker and the authorities.  The Aborigine culture and religion is one that is sovereign with nature.  Their people are fully exposed to the natural elements.  They use a minimal amount of technology, which has allowed them to master the natural environment without creating a new environment.  Their values in nature gave rise to a belief divine spirits within nature, such as the bird that inspired Molly to move on.  Moreover the Aborigine also believes that their ancestor's spirits can be reincarnated into nature.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|After watching this movie when it first came out, I sat in the movie theater trying to figure out what just happened.<br /><br />1.The ship looked like something from early The Next Generation time frame.<br />2.Christopher Pike looked way to old for his role.<br />4. Uhura and Spock lovers ??<br />5.For the most part I did not mind the actors, except the guy who played Scotty cause he looked nothing like him.<br />6.The special effects were way way to much.<br /><br />IMO, they need to tone down the uneccesary action scenes and special effects and have an actual storyline.<br />I still have not decided whether I like this or not, but I would much rather see one more Next Generation movie with the Voyager and Deep Space nine characters involved !<br /><br />**JUST WATCHED THIS MOVIE TONIGHT (10-30-10) FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE IT'S INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE AND LOVED IT SO MUCH THIS TIME !<br />I AM STOKED FOR THE 2012 SEQUEL !! **

B001AVCFK6|2.0|Excelent film.  Poor Star Trek.    I wish they called it diferently. Like Star Action starring super-cool people. I would not be so annoyed.    What is the idea of this Star Trek. When someone tries to kill you, you should kill him first? How very startrekish.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Spoiler alert: Don't read if you haven't watched the movie yet, and don't want to know too much in advance.<br /><br />First off let me say that I am a devoted Star Trek fan, but not a die hard trecker. I don't own a Star Trek encyclopedia, never went to an event, don't speak klingon, and don't own a uniform. But I grew up watching the original series in reruns (TOS). I was so hooked, I never missed a single episode if I could somehow help it, come hell or high water. I also loved the motion pictures with the original cast. But they lost me with TNG (the next generation). I really tried to like it, but never came to care for the characters. Enter the Borgs and I was so disgusted that at that point I jumped ship. Everything produced after TNG went straight over my head. From what I learned, I am not the only one.<br /><br />I watched this new movie three times. Then I spent a lot of time online reading reviews and opinions. I carefully read all the the complains, the criticism. And I can't help but agree. Does this movie carry a message? Other than the hint about water boarding, probably not. Is it about peaceful exploration? No! Does it suffer from ADHD? Is it too fast paced, is there too much action and violence packed in a weak story line, does it have huge plot holes? Is the Kirk character a little over the edge? Does Spock act out of character? Does the whole time travel and alternative universe business stink somewhat? Yes, guilty on all charges. Did I care for this thing between Spock and Uhura? Nay...<br /><br />Is this Star Trek after all??? Yes, it is!<br /><br />I loved the movie. In fact, I weeped with joy. This movie makes me feel like being reunited with dear long lost friends that were left behind for dead. Not to mention the fact that it beamed me right back into my childhood.<br /><br />The key figures of the cast are terrific! Time for a big sigh of relief: Zacchary Quinto was spot on, which is vital for many folks including me who feel that Spock is the character that makes Star Trek truly special. Chris Pine and Karl Urban did a fantastic job too. All supporting characters also are portrayed very well. I admit I didn't care at all for Ben Cross as Sarek. He somehow always lookes like he was pouting.<br /><br />Some of the characters come with a slightly different flavor. Spock is still a little green behind the ears (pun intended!). Kirk is over the edge rebellious, constantly hanging over a cliff with a bloody nose, and doesn't show any interest of classic literature as of yet . But all that makes sense, its an age thing.<br /><br />The only really regrettable twist concerns Amanda. Her character hardly gets any attention and than gets killed of. Along with the whole planet Vulcan at that. That is really hard to stomach, I am still chewing on that one.<br /><br />And still this movie feels so GOOD! It's hard to explain, but I give it a try.<br /><br />Every once in a while along comes a show or story that simply is somehow...magic. That has the stuff fairy tales are made of. That has something that resonates with a primal common core deep inside. Magic is not just a thing of the distant past; they still make that stuff. Really! Simply by following ancient, time proven recipes.<br /><br />Walt Disney, for example, knows a thing or two about magic. Cinderella will never go out of style!<br /><br />Star Trek TOS has that magic. This is why it survived early cancellation in the late sixties. Not only survived, but from there it kept thriving. Despite the painfully cheesy low budget production and reluctant studio bosses who did their best to slash creativity for ratings. Despite the 'Mary Sues' in ridiculously short mini skirts, and terrible special effects. Maybe Star Trek TOS survived and thrived not despite but because it was cancelled, who knows?<br /><br />Don't take me wrong, many of the episodes contain great drama, good conflict with plenty of thought provoking messages. Reflecting on the war in VietnamRodenberry's Starfleet stands for a military force as it should be, using weapons only as a last option, strictly adhering to the prime directive of non interference but still somehow finding ways to stand its ground.

Because they all present old, well known stereotypes.<br /><br />The Kirk, Spock and McCoy troika forms the core. Spock, superior to the mere humans around him, standing for knowledge, science, reason and control, McCoy for expressing and dealing with lower emotions like fear and doubt, but also deep care and nurture as a healer or doctor. The love/hate relationship between those two provides great drama and charming humor. Kirk consults with these two opposites, puts it all together, adds human instincts, intuition and leadership. Now Enterprise is ready to take action.<br /><br />This set of 3 is supported by a framework made of the 4 remaining personalities on the Enterprise bridge, each presenting a different corner and culture of the globe. Uhura from Africa the South, soft spoken and exotic. Scott from Scotland in the North, crafty and energetic. Sulu from Japan in the West, calm with a zen like smile. And Chekov from Russia in the East, the youngest in the lot, eager to please, still an ensign and somewhat low in the food chain, so he doesn't post any threat to the sixties cold war audience.<br /><br />They all line up like ducks in a row or the seven chakras. The Enterprise is the shiny powerful vehicle that holds all the pieces of the puzzle together.<br /><br />Put it all on a new and exciting stage, a promising, positive future, and success is almost inevitable. But if you take away a piece of the puzzle, or the Enterprise, or change the pattern somehow, things get out of balance. This is why things went downhill with all the spin offs. Over time, Star Trek slowly but surely disintegrated.<br /><br />So cliche, some complain. But that doesn't always has to be a flaw, Here it is a thing of beauty.<br /><br />The TOS concept is so simple and elegant, is so immensely satisfying. This is why so many people are fascinated by the Star Trek phenomena. It strikes an ancient cord, it resonates with us.<br /><br />Now, JJ Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, put the pieces back together, and Star Trek as we know and love it is back. They captured the essence and take us to the very beginning of the Enterprise saga and its unique crew, and despite all this new background noise (plot holes, ADHD and all, see above) the story still flows seamlessly, still feels right. Again. All hands back on deck, everybody is back on station. The spirit of Star Trek is back. For that I am eternally grateful!!!<br /><br />If cutting edge special effects and an action filled plot with with lots of humor help drawing wider attention and get more people on board, well, that's even for the better!<br /><br />Lets hope that in future sequels our friends stay together and are allowed to do some growing up from here, getting a little more reflective and wiser on the way, taking us along for the ride. And that the spirit of Star Trek doesn't get watered down to oblivion again. And I hope and pray that our new alternate universe doesn't come with Borgs!!! ;-)<br /><br />To cite Nimoy's Spock: \\"Have faith that the universe unfolds the way it should\\" (Star Trek VI). And: \\"Go with what feels right\\" (Star Trek 2009)<br /><br />Well, that is the way I feel!<br /><br />Please excuse my english, I am not from your world, ummh continent ;-)
0439023491|5.0|5 Stars. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has done it again. Catching Fire, the sequel to The Hunger Games, is just as emotionally charged as the first book. It quickly grips the reader by the heart and squeezes. Raw emotions are ever present. Survival is number one on the hierarchy of need but big surprises await Katniss, Peeta and Gale, ones they could never have predicted. The dark and powerful Capitol looms large over the lives of everyone in the 12 districts, and President Snow wants revenge...<br /><br />I don't read book jackets because they contain a certain measure of spoileriness and I like to be surprised, so I'll never write a review that gives anything away. Suffice to say, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire are intense must read books about a future dystopian North America. (Lots of big words in that sentence but I'm not but a humble pirate. Argh!)<br /><br />Suzanne Collin's active writing style pulls the reader in. There's nothing passive or extraneous in the writing, not a single verb or adjective is out of place. Every word, every sentence, every dialogue propels the story forward and all we can do is hold on. Just enough back story is layered in to remind the reader of important events from book one. Descriptions are brief but distinct. The reader knows the characters and the environment -very much a character in its own right- without being hammered over the head with details. The author leaves room for readers to use their imaginations and personalize everything. Deep point of view allows us to know and love Catniss Everdeen. She's strong yet vulnerable, but never evokes pity. She's our girl on fire.<br /><br />Book three can't come soon enough! The book is brilliant and I'll read the series again, which for me, is really saying something.<br /><br />Let me know what you think. Happy Reading!

B002BI6SMI|5.0|As a woman and mother, this was not easy to watch.  I was clenching my seat, leaning forward while holding my breath for many parts of the movie.  I was alternately disgusted, touched, inspired and frightened throughout this movie.  What a rollercoaster ride!  This is one of the best movies I've watched this year, and I usually don't like action movies because of a lack of plot.  I felt something for these characters.  We need more movies like this one, but it is not for the faint of heart.  I'm not letting my teenage daughter go overseas without a very watchful eye, lol.
B001UW58YU|1.0|The first one was messed up with all kinds of clicks,etc.  Then, they sent another one which is still messed up.  I wonder if Josh is aware that the company which produced this is still selling this messed up DVD? All I wanted was the song \\"He raised me up\\", and all I get is a lot of irritation.
B000P0J09W|5.0|This is a great movie for adults and children alike. It is fun, has adventure, mystery and cool 80's movie gadgets all members of the family would like. Really great to watch with the kids. Enjoy.
B000V86OKG|3.0|Just finished watching this show.  Did it in a couple of days.  That's how absorbing and compelling this second season was.  I thought the first season was excellent but this one just about surpassed it.  The twists and turns, and not to mention unpredictable directions of the characters growth just made it for very irresistible entertainment.    I loved Michael C. Hall's portrayal of Dexter.  He is so completely different than the character he portrayed in \\"Six Feet Under\\", hard to believe that such different characters were played by the same actor.  And this season they deepen his relationship with his sister (Jennifer Carpenter) and Rita (Julie Benz), both of whom I found much more appealing than the way they are portrayed in the book (I know some people are annoyed by both women).  And also Lauren Valez's character is also much more sympathetic on the show than in the (first) book.  David Zayas and C.S. Lee are a hoot.  But best of all Erik King is a great nemesis for Dexter, hounding him and matching every move our beloved Dexter makes.    This season starts off with the discovery by treasure hunters of Dexter's lair and all the bodies that he has sliced up come to surface.  Soon the FBI (led by Keith Carradine) is involved in the investigation, and everyone is looking for the Bay Harbor Butcher, including Dexter himself.  In the home front little sis is recovering from her traumatic attack that closed season I, while Dexter's relation with Rita leads him to seek a recovery program for his \\"addiction\\".  It is during the recovery program that Dexter will also meet the mysterious Lila who will become his \\"sponsor\\".  The plot threads are all laid in place and soon they intertwine for one explosive finale as everything and everyone seems to zero in on the Bay Harbor Butcher.    Most everything about this show was great but I had a couple observations.  The first one was that I was annoyed by the way the character of Lila was played (or directed), she seemed to have stepped out of Ruth Rendell's more bizarre psycho novels into Dexter's Miami.  She just stuck out like a sore thumb, even if she served to further the plot.  Another one was the sex on the show.  For those easily offended you have been forwarned.  (Read the reviews from HBO's \\"True Blood\\").    And finally as much as I loved this show I had two serious objections: (1) This thing did not have any subtitles English or any other language.  C'mon how am I supposed to recommend this to my hearing impaired friends?  Sheesh!  I will just have to warn them to stay away from any SHOWTIME DVD since they seem to be so cheap...and continuing on cheap...(2) The lack of any features in the bonus section.  The boxes promise this and that, blah blah blah, and basically there is almost nothing.  Totally cheap presentation.  For these two reasons Showtime deserves a big deduction of two stars!

It kept me captivated throughout the whole movie; first, wondering how Fannie would ever fit in, and then - would she ever find true love?  In between, she has to grapple with situations that some might find uncomfortable - for instance, when she comes across Tom's notebook.  WARNING!  The drawings are VERY GRAPHIC in nature!!!  It denotes a time that some would like to forget; but it happened, and there it is.  She also has to find her heart and stay true to her own deteremined path.  I liked it very much.
1401223176|5.0|I'm not much of a comics reader, but Batman is easily my favorite character (although I'm in the minority who have found his live-action adaptations to be disappointing). And this particular collection is THE comic book for people who don't often read comic books.<br /><br />Only a passing knowledge of Batman lore is needed to enjoy the story, and virtually all of the characters in his history make appearances of varying degrees. The highlight is his battle of wits with Superman, and seeing the famous contrast in styles between the two characters at work here, both as combatants and allies. It makes one desperately wish they'd make a live-action crossover film (and while one almost did get made before these current reboots, it seems unlikely now, save for the upcoming Justice League film). There are also some great interactions here between Clark, Bruce, and Lois.<br /><br />Jim Lee's style can be a bit too technical and lacking in character, but I'm still a fan of his clean, dynamic style, and it's great to see it applied to the Batman world. His Catwoman/Selina is particularly memorable. The way all the characters are shoehorned into the story can come off as contrived in some regards, but for the most part it works and makes for a highly entertaining adventure.
B001PR0YBM|5.0|I took a break from a marathon of Stanley Kubrick movies on Blu-Ray to go see this movie in the theater with a friend this last weekend. And all I can say is - wow. What a great film.<br /><br />Oddly enough, making the transition from The Shining and Full Metal Jacket to Ponyo was not as abrupt a break as one might imagine. This movie is lighthearted and fun unlike the aforementioned films, but like those films this production very much demonstrates a dedication to creating powerful visuals and emotion at the expense of 'realism' and traditional narrative; a trait that both Stanley Kubrick and Miyazaki have in common.<br /><br />--- Note: Spoilers Abound Beyond This Point ---<br /><br />This is a basic boy meets girl story- or at least the fairytale version of one- complete with the inevitable happy ending. Ponyo is a magical fish-girl who runs away from her idealistic and tyrannical father, a powerful wizard who lives in the sea. She is found by a five-year-old boy named Sasuke who makes a literal blood-bond with her; Sasuke first makes her his pet, and after she learns to speak with him he embraces her as his friend. Sasuke's mother accepts Ponyo into her home first as Sasuke's magical pet, and when she returns to Sakuke after being abducted by her father, she accepts responsibility for Ponyo transformed into a little girl just as easily. After a test of love (arranged by Ponyo's mother, who is some form of sea goddess), Ponyo is fully transformed into a human, and Ponyo and Sasuke grow up together (presumably) happily ever after. The End.<br /><br />From what I can see, the main criticism of this film has been that the story frankly does not make much sense, at least when one gets to the fine details of the tale. This seems to me to be a fair point; I myself could not make heads of tails of the story from any logical perspective. Ponyo's father, the alchemist who lives in the sea is introduced and exits without any real background explanation; the sea goddess appears and explains that 'we all come from sea foam'- and although this is demonstrated visually, the mechanism by which these creatures are transformed otherwise is left to the viewers imagination. Ponyo somehow triggers an ecological cataclysm/new epoch/renaissance where the moon draws in close, the sea levels rise, and prehistoric sea life appears (?) - and once again, no satisfactory reason for all of this is provided, or even hinted at. If this was a science-fiction story, I would have to call it a complete failure.<br /><br />But this is not science-fiction, or even traditional fantasy; this is a fairy tale, this is mythology, and Miyazaki's mostly visual narrative makes this clear with the bold confidence of a veteran filmmaker throughout. The true magic of this movie is that while the plot itself might be full of holes as wide as the ocean, the characters feel believable and human throughout. Sasuke's mother in particular is a well-written and attractive character, and her relationship with Sasuke's absentee father shows the strains of a real marriage without ever lapsing into melodrama. There is as much here for the adults as the kids, and Miyazaki balances the adult and child perspectives with an even hand.<br /><br />Complaints about the film's visuals are, from my perspective, fully unfounded. This is a gorgeous, gorgeous film, and is a stunning example of what 2-D animation can do that no other medium can master. The visual narrative that Miyazaki has built his career around- the narrative of transformation- is fully explored here, even more so than in Howl's Moving Castle, which seemed to take this concept to the logical limit at the time.<br /><br />In this movie, however, transformations are taken beyond any logical limit and into the logic of dreams or that of the spiritual world, or the world of magic; and in the final analysis these are all the same thing. From the beginning the sea itself is presented as a character, as a living thing - it is evenanimated in the same bright, flat cel-colors that the other characters are (look at the water in Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke for a counter-example to this style). The first time we are shown the painterly landscapes surrounded by the cartoon sea this fact is made immediately clear, at least to those familiar with the language of traditional animation.<br /><br />In short, in absence of much in the way of traditional narrative the visuals themselves are called upon to tell the story, and the story they tell 'works'; and it works quite well on an emotional, pre-conscious level. Water transforms into fish, and the fish into waves, and back again; Ponyo herself shifts between forms seemingly at will. What makes the human characters human in this film seems to be that they are fixed to a single form. The narrative truths of the story are all there, but folded fully into the visuals rather than exposition.<br /><br />Now, one shouldn't walk away from this review thinking that this is somehow the animated equivalent of a Fellini film. Miyazaki himself stated that he made the movie for a five-year-old child, and the strong reliance on visuals to tell the story, along with the emphasis of emotional over objective truths should be understood with this goal in mind. But unlike most entertainment made for small children the objective seems to be to expand the mind rather than pander to a limited understanding; to appeal to the nobler instincts rather than the base. But like mentioned earlier, there is much to appreciate here for viewers of all ages.<br /><br />In summary, I believe this movie to be a masterwork, rather than a 'lesser' Miyazaki film. I frankly do not think that he could have even pulled something like this off in the 80's when Studio Ghibli was first founded; the absolute boldness and even-handedness of this ambitious work is something that only a mature director could achieve. Again, it's designed for younger viewers than something like Princess Mononoke or even Spirited Away, and this should be understood upon viewing it. But this is a film that clearly achieves every goal that the filmmaker set out to reach, and it does so in a lyrical, beautifully poetic style.<br /><br />If this truly is the last film that Miyazaki directs (a tune he has sung many a time before...), this will remain as much a testimony to his vision as any of his other creations.<br /><br />Highly recommended.he other characters are (look at the water in Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke for a counter-example to this style).

B001J4E1D8|5.0|This story has so many layers, every time you watch it you will add another dimension to what you have seen...from the open symbolism of nature, fertility, youth, and innocence, to the subtle use of clothing, colors, lighting, and even the names of the characters. The obvious issues of chauvinism and societal 'standards' will have you throwing things at the screen. You'll cheer Tess when she finds her voice and tells her mother 'what for' and wonder where it went when she submits to the control of others. Even with her awful life, Tess keeps going, keeps hoping, to the very end. I haven't watched another version...this one is haunting enough. A rich story of a poor girl and a considerable social comment considering it was written in 1891. Thank you to the producers of this film.

0743496736|2.0|faI'm a teacher who had to read this book since it was on the kids' summer reading list.  While it's certainly a great high school summer reading book, with many issues we will be discussing in class, I feel it's a pretty mediocre book on its own merits.    My main objection is that the high school cliques and cruelty are broad brush strokes of stereotypes and cliches, and not reality at all.  It's like she watched a lot of Hollywood movies and took it from there.      First of all - my biggest objection - is that bullying in high school just never reaches this level without consequences.  I'm NOT saying there is no bullying, nor am I saying that bullying isn't a huge problem!  It is. It's just, let's discuss it as it is:  insidious, subtle, terrifying on a slow burn.  For example, typical high school bullying is to pass a suspected gay kid and mutter, \\"[...]\\" in the hallway.  Or to throw spit balls on the back of his neck in health class.  If it were anything as abusive as pulling down a child's pants in the cafeteria, that would be a matter for the police. That's physical assault.  Any school in this day and age would know this.  The problem with bullying by high school is that the bullies are far more subtle.  With the above example, the gay student is always, always uncomfortable walking the hallways; he never feels safe.  But how shall he complain?  He goes to guidance and says, \\"There's these kids, I don't know who they are, when I'm walking the hallway, sometimes they mutter '[...].'\\"  You see how subtle and clever this kind of bullying is?  This is what happens.  Breaking glasses, pulling down pants--these are acts of documentable violence that would just not be tolerated in this sort of school (suburban, upper middle class). Just no way.      In addition, I found the 'cliques' to also be unbelievable.  These are also Hollywood versions of 'reality.'  Jocks are just not the sort who bully like this--they wouldn't CARE about a kid like Peter by 10th grade.  He would be just so far below them that he wouldn't exist; it wouldn't be cool to care about him.  (In middle school he would be bullied more actively.)  The kid who would mutter '[...]' is the 'loser' kid, the kid with the really messed up home life, sometimes a jock, but straddling the world of jocks and alcoholics and 'problem' kids.  These are kids who are written up for other things as well, cutting class etc.  Not that seemingly 'good' kids don't bully-I'm not saying that.  It's just, by 10th grade, certainly 11th, it's simply NOT COOL to go out of the way to actively and unsubtly bully a kid.      I have other problems with the book, such as its predictability, and that some of the characters are made to do things they wouldn't do, such as Josie.  On the positive side, there was a lot of potential with some relationships, such as Josie and Matt; Matt was really creepy and abusive (in a subtle way!) I would have liked to have seen more of this.  Also, Peter's older brother.  I thought his death would have played more into Peter's actions, but it didn't seem to have much affect at all other than as a plot device to explain why decent enough parents got distracted that final year.  This was too convenient a plot device.  I did read the book quickly, though.

0767817478|4.0|My son and I just watched the original Gojira, and he insisted on watching this the next day.  OK, it doesn't have the dark tragedy of the original, but it really is pretty fun and there is a lot more humor.<br /><br />In addition to the theme of science run amok - yes, Godzilla is a mutant due to French nuclear testing in the Pacific - there is a hilarious theme of silly bosses and their smarter underlings, who of course are the ones who solve the problem by sheer guts and practicality.  With the New York characters, that makes this more original than most monsters-in-the-city films.  The acting is indeed very good and the special effects are spectacular.<br /><br />It won't rock your world and it isn't faithful to the original, but this is just a monster flick, and it is definitely better than average.  If you take it for what it is, you can enjoy it.<br /><br />Recommended.
B002BFBAWO|3.0|This movie was kind of like 'Dazed and Confused' light. It was ok. Kristen Stewart is the stand out and Ryan Reynolds is like dog poop in that he is in everything and I believe I have seen him play this kind of part before. Still a nice little movie with some yucks. Some of the late 80's themes made me chuckle quite a bit.

0743496736|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" by Jodi Picoult, a welcome return to writing form for her, in my opinion, after my disappointment with the far-fetched \\"The Pact\\" and the dreadful \\"Salem Falls\\".  Very well plotted and exceptionally well written, \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" had me engrossed from page one, with its gripping account of the lead up to and aftermath of a high school shooting.  Picoult writes very well about the non-stop, inexplicable teasing meted out since kindergarten to Peter Houghton, the boy who snaps one day and shoots dead nine students and a teacher at his high school.  His story is interwoven with that of Josie Cormier, his childhood best friend who turns on him in high school, to become one of the in-crowd.  Josie survives the shooting spree which kills her uber-jock boyfriend, Matthew Royston, but Josie is hiding a secret; despite being one of the most popular girls in school, she feels hugely conflicted by this and harbours dark thoughts of how much of a fake she really is.  Picoult's ability to write plausibly and sympathetically from the viewpoint of a teenager is uncanny, one of her strongest skills, and she really nails it in this novel.    I do have a couple of criticisms, though, which prevent me from giving the novel 5 stars.  The first is that I never really understood why Peter suffered so much torment at the hands of others from age five to age 17.  The bullying seemed to be a bit over-the-top to me and I never really got why he was victimised the way he was, given that he was normal looking, and not particularly freaky in any way.  I also did not understand why his parents seemed so oblivious to the teasing and why the school was so lacklustre about dealing with it.  The second criticism is that it is easy to discern the fact that there were probably two shooters, and who the second shooter was, about half-way into the novel.  This ruined some of the suspense for me, but despite this, the novel was well resolved (though somewhat abrupt) and never short of gripping.    All in all, an excellent book and full marks to Picoult for crafting such a good, readable novel from her usual \\"hot button\\" list of topics.  Great stuff, it is good to see her back in form with this crowd pleaser of a novel.  It deserves to be widely read.  Well done, Ms Picoult!!!
B001P9KR94|1.0|I had seen the movie in theatre and absolutely loved it hence decided to buy a personal BD.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|I think that Whitney's I look to You is her most autobigraphical and personal album yet.  From the ballads, I look to you, and I didn't know my own strength, you can feel through her voice, her struggles, her lowpoints, how she got to know that she was strong and who she looked to for help.I think when we see her on Oprah on Sept 14 & 15, the songs abov e will be put in context.  When  she mournfully croons, '...i didnt know if i would make it, all i could do is lift my head, i look to you..' I so feel her on that,my heart ached because i felt her desparation and call out for help.    While A song for you will never touch her masterful rendition that she did at the welcome home heroes show(youtube it- no one has been able to touch that rendition) , it is unique and beautiful in it's own way and somehow the lyrics now fit her life at this stage more, '..i've been so many places in my life and time, sung alot of songss, made some bad rhyme....and when my life is over, remember when we were alone, i was singing this song for you..'. there is a haunting quality to her voice when she sings this and then it breaks into a more upbeat dance number that is more triumphant.    For the Lovers sees houston belting, 'throw your hands up, for the next 3 mins this is for the lovers' this thumping number will have you on the dance floor and people will see why she is just as good on dance tracks- the Voice is very powerful here and the phrasing is great.      There are other strong songs such as Worth it' and Call you tonight as well,  The set closes out with the song 'Salute' that just seems to be about her telling her ex- husband that she made it just fine without him and that he can leave and go on out the door now. With Houston singing',...you said i could never do better, I CAN do better, yeah right, whatever, i'm feeling a bit stronger than you, lately, i'm feeling abit taller that you, yeah baby lately..' one feel that indeed, Ms. Houston is in a better space personally andspiritually.       This is a strong album, suprisingly by houston and there are many, many good songs on it.  This is an album that i don't skip any tracks which for me is rare- If you listen without predjudice and try not to compare her to her 20's which is silly, you will enjoy an awesome album by houston who lets us into her life more than she has in the pass.
B000UX6THK|5.0|There are people who will say Eraserhead is Lynch's masterwork because of its surrealism and audacity, but with a lot of help, Lynch accomplished something very special with Twin Peaks. Like poor Laura Palmer, it was beautiful, dirty, multifaceted, enigmatic and gone too soon. Though it is not solely Lynch' s work, it benefits from extra sets of hands. Lynch is intuitive and nonverbal, he's more fortuneteller than storyteller and while these qualities in him make him a true cinematic magus, with the help of others more concerned with establishing narrative he does stronger work. While there might be a few weak episodes in the second season, Cooper's odyssey is not one to be missed. The extras are tons of fun and it will be the mayor of your DVD shelf.

0307454541|5.0|First, let me say that I earn a decent living playing with words myself. I've been a virtually non-stop reader since first grade and have become quite a connoisseur over the decades. Last week I was finally enticed into buying (and reading in 4 days) Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Thought it was wonderful! Unique characters, intricate plot, exotic settings... \\"everything what's good\\" as a friend of mine used to put it.<br /><br />That's not to say it was all delightful. No doubt, there was a lot of detail, which bogged the story down in a couple of places, and some of the violence and brutality would be over the line for many. I didn't find it gratuitous, though. The impact of the whole piece was worth it.<br /><br />And, by waiting so long to read the first book in the trilogy, I was able to immediately buy and read the second book, Girl Who Played with Fire. And I've already signed up to be notified when the next one is available in English.<br /><br />I only hope Larsson is looking on from somewhere following his untimely death and taking some satisfaction in the the success of his books (and the total enrichment of his estate!). Both the success and enrichment are well deserved.

By day, I searched from the sky for fleeing Cubans escaping socialism, and, at night, listened to Dave and Company on terra firma. These jazz beginnings of mine occurred via total immersion in the jazz sounds emanating from a Columbia 33 and a third LP, while reclining on my bunk in communal Navy Barracks 628 located at Boca Chica Field, Naval Air Station Key West, Florida. I quietly and reflectively listened to Dave*s Quartet, re-listened to them repeatedly, again, again, and again --- as I drank in the *You cannot listen to them only once* West Coast Jazz, signature Dave Brubeck Quartet sounds of those, now, jazz classics, TAKE FIVE and BLUE RONDO A LA TURK.<br /><br />It did not take that many 33 and a third RPM rotations before TAKE FIVE and BLUE RONDO A LA TURK took me and hooked me, and I became musically one with Dave, Paul, Eugene, and Joe. Ever since, unbeknownst to the Dave and the rest of his Jazz Quartet, stealth, fifth member element, young Watakushi-wa, me, was permanently added to their musical quartet.<br /><br />What followed has been a jazz music listening life of enjoying and loving to hear Dave play solo or joined in jazz concert by his various Bands of Jazz Brothers.<br /><br />LIVE LONG, LISTEN WELL & PROSPER!

This is the album that launched the band, already known for its anthem \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" into the stratosphere of rock stardom.<br /><br />The quintessential U2 album, the CD starts out with three of the band's biggest hits - \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"With or Without You.\\" Beyond the hits, the album remains solid the whole way through, and its changes in pace - like from the hard-rocking \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" to the softer \\"Running to Stand Still\\" - never feel disjointed.<br /><br />Thematically, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" delves deeper than the more overtly-political earlier U2 albums like \\"War.\\" This album is more introspective, and its slower pace lends itself well to that.<br /><br />A word of warning to those buying older editions of the CD: in the original pressings the last chorus of \\"One Tree Hill\\" (track 9) is accidentally placed at the beginning of track 10, \\"Exit.\\" It's only a 10 second or so error, but even still make sure you get the newer editions.

0439023491|5.0|Its been days since I finished reading Catching Fire and Im still reeling over some of the events that took place in it.  To say the least Collins has truly created another masterpiece that rates as high as its predecessor.  Once again we enter the book right as the action starts, Katness is unwittingly at the forefront of war between the districts and the Capital and all too soon realizes that maybe there is no way out.  Following Katniss and Peeta through this book very much puts the range of your emotions to the test. I wont really give anything away however when I found out about the Capital's wine glasses I balked in disgust, when I learned about the Quarter Quell I felt shock and despaired, when Peeta wow'd the crowd at the interview I laughed and actually slapped my knee, I even hoped against hope that maybe the interview could bring change, and even the ending, which I somewhat felt was expected, was enough to have me sitting there looking at the page for a time afterwards.  However the last emotion I felt was slight annoyance and anticipation.  Catching Fire ends in a similar fashion to the Hunger Games.  You get to the last page, blink, look over the book/internet for some clue or hint on the next book and then settle down knowing you have no choice but to once again wait.  So while I highly recommend this book with five stars (I would give it more if I could) I caution you a) once you start reading this book putting it down becomes a battle of wills and b) Once your finished, the book is finished for now. You will have joined the group of us who wait for the third book and hope in it some justice will be dealt out to the Capital.

B00164GDD2|4.0|The film was viewed on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player. This film remains a classic for me, and I love the film, premise, and soundtrack. The film translates very well to Blu-Ray and sharper and even more vibrant in this format. It is not perfect, but the upgrade for fans, is definitely worth it. The entire cast is fantastic, and the \\"Ghostbusters\\" adventures still hold up well for me. Definitely recommended!
0061537969|5.0|A wonderful story with memorable characters, not the least of which is of course the narrator, Enzo.  Many good life lessons appear throughout the book while one is engaged with the story and the ups and downs of each of the characters.  Enzo's King Karma is a particularly important part of the story and a key take away from the book.    Loved the car racing metaphors which are an integral part of the story and like many who love this book I am not particularly a car racing fan.  One does not need to be a pet lover or racing fan to get everything out of this book but if you are one or both then this book will be especially meaningful for you.    The author's use of the real names of the places in and around Seattle where the story is set further added to the value of the book for those of us intimately familiar with Seattle as we could easily visualize the wonderful settings where the story takes place.    A book sequel is in order and this would certainly make a fine film.
0688002307|1.0|This was by far the most boring book I have ever suffered through.  Yes.  I read it all.  From all the hype on it, I knew it must get better.  NOT...

0743270754|4.0|that I enjoyed, but for such a long, weighty tome, I wished it would have let you into the day-to-day  life of Abraham Lincoln.  Don't get me wrong, this book describe the poiitical genius of Lincoln; especially  those early years before and during his nomination, which is the best part of this book.  But it is lacking in the day-to-day reactions that Lincoln must have had during the course of the Civil War.  DKG adequately describes the ecology and the people who surrounded Lincoln, but she sometime misses him completely! Of course, as the book title reveals, the theme of the book is about Lincoln and his cabinet so their is much description about Samuel Chase (alittle too negatively), Edwin Stanton, Edward Bates, Gideon Welles, and William Henry Seward.  Also described are the Blairs, John Hay and John Nicolay, and his generals: McClellan, Burnside, Meade, Grant, Sherman and the opposition leaders as well.    I think what I like most about this book is that it shows the crafty, politcal nature of Lincoln.  Put into a context, Lincoln is great showman who could charm the skin off of a snake.

B00144VBBS|5.0|After years of struggling to get anybody in the music business to take him seriously, Toby first made the big time in 1993 with Should've been a cowboy, which was one of the must popular country songs of the nineties, and he has maintained a consistently high level of success since, up to the release of this compilation. He knows, as all singers do, that success with new material won't last forever, but you can be sure that he'll be trying to keep his career going for as long as possible.<br /><br />The compilation title wasn't entirely accurate even at the time of release, but it contains all the hits that matter from the period 1993 to 2006.  This includes the big hits from his first album on Toby's own label, Show Dog Nashville, which was titled White trash with money.  Although this compilation dates from 2008, it doesn't contain any of his big hits from his 2007 album, Big Dog Daddy, which is fair enough as the album was his current original album at the time. As seems to be the custom with hits compilations by current performers these days, Toby recorded one song, She's a hottie, specially for the compilation. Released as a single, it made the country top twenty.<br /><br />Three duets are included here, these being I'm so happy I can't stop crying (with Sting, whose musical tastes appear to be very eclectic, though he also recorded a duet with Tammy Wynette, so he enjoys some country music) , Mockingbird (with his daughter, this is a cover of the classic pop song written and first recorded by Charlie and Inez Foxx, but which is more famous via the Carly Simon and James Taylor cover) and Beer for my horses (with Willie Nelson). Of these, Mockingbird was only a modest country hit (though I think it deserved to be a big hit) but the other two were both huge hits. Toby has also recorded duets with other singers including the Beach Boys and Jimmy Buffett, but those recordings are outside the scope of this hits compilation.<br /><br />Toby was very successful during the early part of his career when he recorded for Mercury. Following his debut success with Should've been a cowboy, he had many other big hits, my favorites among them being (in the order in which they were released, which isn't my order of preference) A little less talk and a lot more action, Wish I didn't know now, Who's that man, You ain't much fun, A woman's touch Does that blue moon ever shine on you and Me too, though I love all the other songs too. Having bought the earlier Greatest hits volume 1, I had these songs already, but for one reason or another, I never bought any of Toby's other music, apart from his first Christmas album (filled with original material), until I bought this compilation. With the exception of one minor hit that wasn`t successful enough to merit inclusion here, If a man answers, all the tracks from that compilation are to be found here.<br /><br />It seemed that Toby's career was beginning to fade when he switched to Dreamworks in 1998. That was a good move, because during his years with that label he became even more successful than he had ever been before.<br /><br />During his Dreamworks years, Toby became known for his political views although I'm not clear whether this was because he started recording political songs, or whether he made his political views clear before he started recording those songs. One of the most controversial songs was Courtesy of the red white and blue, which ultimately started some bad feelings between Toby and the Dixie Chicks. Natalie Maines once wore a T-shirt emblazoned with an acronym that she said stood for Friends United in Truth and Kindness, but few people believed her claim even before she eventually admitted what everybody had concluded anyway.<br /><br />Of his solo hits on Dreamworks, my favorites include (in the order in which they were released, which isn't my order of preference) How do you like me now?, My list, I love this bar, Whiskey girl, As good as I once was and Big blue note. But as with his earlier Mercury hits, Toby had so many great songs that your favorites may be among the songs I haven't mentioned.<br /><br />Toby sings great songs, many of which he wrote or co-wrote, though he's happy to record original songs written by others as well as the occasional cover. Toby's gritty voice may not appeal to everybody, but it is a real country voice so it's no surprise that he is popular among country fans. Every country fan should have at least one Toby Keith album. If you only want one collection of Toby's music, this is the one to buy, containing as it does all his big hits from 1993 to 2006.o many great songs that your favorites may be among the songs I haven't mentioned.

1594202249|2.0|I've been an admirer of the vintage Pynchon--V., The Crying of Lot 49, and of course Gravity's Rainbow. I understood that Inherent Vice is a walk into Genreland, but it's been disappointing to see just how generic it is. Inherent Vice is set in L.A. near the end of the Sixties, and the protagonist is a detective named Doc Sportello, an aging hippie who smokes weed on the job and falls off roofs. And that's about as good as it gets.<br /><br />The novel is laced with references to the popular culture of the period--Country Joe and the Fish, Zig-Zag papers, Charles Manson, head shops, psychedelic posters, and dope dope dope. Often this texture seems forced, a sort of authorial obligation, and this is especially true with the language of those gone days. Doc is supposed to be our refresher course in Sixties slang, but it's annoying how often Pynchon gets it wrong. When asked if he will accept an I.O.U., Doc replies, \\"I'm groovy with that.\\" Hey, I was there. No one with an ounce of hip would have used \\"groovy\\" that way. Old slang is embarrassing enough even when the author gets it right.<br /><br />If you're simply looking for a detective story, Inherent Vice will probably do you fine. But if you're looking for the Pynchon of yore, you'll be BUMMED OUT.

The discs auto play from episode to episode which is something HBO has yet to learn how to do. Overall, the extras are worth the buy, good season, hopefully they don't milk this one for 9 seasons like Smalltown. Notice I am reviewing the product not the particulars of the show, save that for Blogs.

B000002JKA|5.0|Forget Scenes from a Memory. Forget Images and Words. Awake is Dream Theater's best album and one the best albums of all time, period. As a concept it is seamless. The production is excellent. The lyrics and vocals are beautiful. The musicianship is top notch, as opposed to the shredding Dream Theater have been prone to in their later releases.<br /><br />The balance between the heavy and the soft stuff is perfect. Each track is a masterpiece in its own right. This is Dream Theater at their artistic peak. I've seen them live twice, but unfortunately they haven't played any cuts from Awake. \\"Voices,\\" \\"The Mirror,\\" and \\"Lifting Shadows off a Dream\\" are all favorites of mine, but honestly the band could play the whole album live and receive no complaint from me.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|This is a well-done and believable series originally aired on HBO that attempts to make these historical figures life-like and the events surrounding them more understandable. The action moves a bit fast at times, and I was actually disappointed more time wasn't spent on the Revolution itself. But it is obviously aimed at personalizing Adams and his wife more than relating the specific events of the American Revolution.    My only criticism might be that some characters are depicted in ways that I personally doubt. I'm relatively sure the producers researched them and tried to be accurate in their portrayals, but I'm not convinced in all cases.    The additional background portion of the DVD set is apparently vital to the understanding of the series, and I haven't yet viewed that. Perhaps that's why I'm uncomfortable with some of the characterizations. But overall, it's a well-made series, and students in public schools would be far better off watching this kind of thing than Michael Moore and Al Gore trash.

B000244EMO|5.0|Twenty years on, and several sequels later, Predator without a doubt, is not only the best in the series, but still a great, inventive and incredibly suspenseful movie.    Much of the commando team proves memorable, notably Jesse Ventura as Blaine and fantastic Carl Weathers as Dillon. In the lead, Schwarzenegger as \\"Dutch\\" is classic Arnold. Here he seems completely at ease in his character with good dashes of humor, \\"What's the matter Dillon? CIA got you pushing too many pencils?\\" This is probably my favorite role for Arnie.    The story here is simple but effective, the filmmakers settling on a \\"less is more\\" strategy in almost every category. A special forces team on a central American jungle mission are tracked and killed by an alien hunter. While some of the scenes are lacking not due to dating, or technological constraints - surprisingly the elementary special effects still do the job - but more obviously budget constraints. The guerilla camp raid action scene feels a bit limited in this respect and I think budget had a lot to do with it. The sequence is also probably in line with other slam bang type 80s action movies also.    Other flaws and smudges? I think there are some idiotic death scenes in the movie belying the intelligence portrayed by members of Dutch's group. Sonny Landhams last stand with his big knife is stupid, even though you just hear it. Authenticity is also a question with so many recent movies going mega realistic on military tactics. I just hate seeing so many people shooting automatic rifles from the hip. Put that gun to your shoulder soldier.    The music score is fantastic, and memorable. The predator is judiciously revealed, a tactic that definitely adds to the suspense factor of the movie. McTiernan's pre Die Hard direction is awfully good. He keeps everything at a simmer and when its time, the movie goes to full boil.    The script's subtlety comes to the fore with a great final showdown with the wonderfully menacing Predator. Dutchuses the cunning of a hunter, and largely, his own two hands and not guns to win the battle. This is a rare thing in modern action movies where we are commonly assaulted with endless pornography of automatic weapons.     On the subject of sequels, I am a fan of Predator 2, but anything that followed, including the new AvP Requiem was trash. The only stand out criticism, in Predator 2 and AvP R being a clear escalation on the part of the filmmakers in the gore department, and the others, the overwrought special effects. I'm not squeamish or against good computer effects, but I think the real strength of the first movie has nothing to do with blood or bombs, it is that there were strong characters and in the gore and effects department, less was indeed more. Its not hard to find why all the sequels of Predator were such failures. That and most of them were just crappy movies.

0385340575|5.0|A lot of times my favorite authors let me down. Perhaps my expectations are too high, but when I read I want a story and characters that I care about. Lee Child has never let me down in that regard. Jack Reacher is one of those bigger than life characters for whom you always automatically root. I found the plot in GONE TOMORROW to be compelling and engaging. The plot was rather complicated, so attention is needed. I read the book over the course of two afternoons, and couldn't wait to get back to it on the second day. There are plenty of good and bad guys which as with many Reacher novels are hard to which is which, but that's part of the fun.    Highly recommended.
B00005AG7K|1.0|This film and the accompanying soundtrack boasts the worst work that the Fab Four ever produced. The horrible sound, vaccuous, drug-induced lyrical crud and lack of real musicality signals this vomit as possibly rivalling the Bee Gees Sgt. Pepper's film as the worst rock film of all time. At times dressed in plushy outfits and filmed in the oh-so-blah countryside on oh-so-blah grey days, the four Beatles indulge themselves in being the cutesy and oh-so-witty(because we WROTE it that way) boy-band of their era. The result is the same as with every film that vainly tries to promote a band that is uninspired: a trash heap. The songs stand as simply the least well-performed and least interesting of all of the Beatles' repertoire. \\"Fool on the Hill\\" is a drab, lack-lustre experiment with pseudo-melancholic tonal structure and forced psychedelic-cool nonsense lyrics.<br /><br />It's just not entertaining, nor is it featuring any truly strong songs.<br /><br />The reliance on Brit terms (\\"Roll Up\\") gets as boring as listening to another treatise on Brittania's rightful role. Lennon strings some poorly-conceived chord exchanges in a drab production of his (famous?) \\"I Am The Walrus.\\" \\"Strawberry Fields\\" has no reference visually in this trash film.<br /><br />No script, no thought, no concept... this film pales in comparison to the other films by this most-important group. I recommend \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" or even \\"Help!\\" before wasting your time getting this trainwreck.<br /><br />Roll up... more like plug up... your nose.

0061122416|3.0|A lot of people rave about this book. I read it twice. Once several years ago, and once recently. People that have read it, check this out: the kid has stolen from him every significant bunch of wealth he gets - do you hold out much hope that he will hang on to this final, huge, highly steal-able \\"treasure\\" at the end? The narrator pontificates like there is no tomorrow - of course, that is fun to do, so I can't blame the author on that account, but these \\"truths\\" that get rattled off - give me a break.     The book is an interesting mix of charming story, pseudo-spriituality, utter money-grubing materialism, and BS, kind of like a dream. Some good marketing ideasin the section on the crystal dealer. The kid is kind of fickle - he likes this girl, then that one - who is next? Ultimately, I felt like I was left with not much. But I did like parts of it. Lots of people talk about this book - you will read it eventually. I wonder what how you will feel about it?

B000BFH2S2|5.0|If you like the old Sinatra era standards, or modern songs sung with a great Big Band sound in that same genre, but updated to modern standards of audio perfection, you will love this dvd/cd collection by Michael Buble' and his big band. Michael is simply the best of the new crooners who has dug up, dusted off, and remixed the whole crooner style with a modern and up to date polished edge. He is totally sincere in his love for these songs and the genre he is singing, and his enthusiasm for this style of music is simply infectious.<br /><br />Even if you were not one who thought much of this style to begin with, you'll be tapping your hands and feet along with the beat on these familiar melodies and originals. He also has a few guest performers who share the stage with him for a few duets. His charm and connection with the audience is that of an old trusted hand who genuinely enjoys performing and treats his audience like close friends... even the video audience (this was a taped PBS special). Young and old alike will enjoy watching this honest and mature performer... one you can watch with the whole family, wholesome but classy. The guy just exudes class, but it is real and not pretentious.<br /><br />And the man's musical delivery of his songs is without par. He truly is in a class by himself. A world class talent. Simply the best! He will renew your faith that in a world of crappy rap, hip-slop, and irritating dog-done-died country twangers and head banging bs, there are still true artists out there who create wonderful musical performances that demonstrate the best of what humans can do when they set their minds to creating, singing, and playing enjoyable music.<br /><br />Not to be missed! if he comes to your town RUN to get tickets!!!<br /><br />Bernardo
B0021L8US0|4.0|After viewing District 9 today, I can only conclude that this film is Peter Jackson's attempt at social commentary concerning South Africa's past apartheid system. I say this because of the obvious similarities between the treatment of South Africa's black population and the aliens living in District 9.<br /><br />During the 1960's to early 1980's, the South African government implemented a policy whereby South African Blacks, Indians, and Coloreds were forced to \\"resettle\\" into separate homelands. As a result, the government segregated education and public services to name a few. This is no different to what the aliens in District 9 had to endure. Of course, it didn't hurt to have an entire South African population that was, for the most part, xenophobic, which is not surprising because humans in general are \\"speciesist.\\"<br /><br />The film will, hopefully, force the viewer to question his own beliefs and his sense of morality when it comes to the treatment of other racial groups and how our views should be evaluated and changed, if possible. One only need look at the Native Americans of the United States to see how man's evil against his human brother exemplifies Jackson's critique of South African apartheid. The Native American are considered by sociologist to be living in a \\"Fourth World\\" within a \\"First World\\" nation!<br /><br />Viewers who seek mindless entertainment provided by excessive CGI should look elsewhere for their entertainment. I say this because I've already spoken to a few individuals who fit this type and they were mostly of the opinion that District 9 was a \\"boring\\" film.<br /><br />In the end, I think the movie is worth seeing at least once, but not at current ticket prices. Wait until it becomes available for rent. You won't miss anything by not seeing it on a big screen.

B000055Y0Y|5.0|This is a superb film in which Clint Eastwood is perfectly cast as the (fictional) Secret Service agent who was closest to John F. Kennedy on the day of his assassination.  Thirty years later Eastwood is nearing retirement, and has never lived down his failure to protect the President on that day.  Now, a trained killer has announced his intention to take out the current President, and Eastwood is obsessed with preventing this, thereby expunging, or at least absolving himself, for his earlier failure.<br /><br />This film really does have it all.  Eastwood superbly carries off his assigned role.  The rest of the cast is similarly excellent (Fred Thompson is great as the President's Chief of Staff.)  The somewhat intricate story is put together carefully, and realistically, and this is done so clearly that the viewer never loses track of what is going on.  Every scene contributes to the eventual climax of the film.  No spoilers here.  This film combines just the right combination of intrigue, character development, plot development, and action -- plenty of action.  The storyline never drags and this film carries the viewer along to its conclusion brilliantly.<br /><br />This was a perfect vehicle for Clint Eastwood to show off his considerable talent.

B0007ZEO4G|4.0|deep purple,s burn was the first to feature the mark 3 line-up with new vocalist david coverdale whom would later go on to form whitesnake.and glenn hughs on bass replacing roger glover. burn is a very good album in my opinion for a band that was and is constantly changing members like most clean people change their underwear.sorry bad analogy!!one reason for the constant line-up changes was guitar maestro ritchie blackmore.ritchie could be  very difficult at times or so rumour has it.the album cover for burn is one of the coolest in rock!! for me the stand out cuts are;burn,lay down stay down,what,s going on here and mistreated.if you are a purple fan get this!!!
0307588335|1.0|This book was not at all what I expected and I find the title terribly misleading.  This book isn't so much about Lehman Brothers as much as it is a the autobiography of the author, Larry McDonald.  I really wish I could return this book to Amazon and get my money back even though it's past the 30 days since the title is so misleading.

0446607274|2.0|Although I am a avid reader, I had never read anything by Michael Connelly until mid July. Since then I have read ten of them.( 2 Haller; 2 McEvoy; and 6 Bosch ) There are a whole lot of things that I like about Harry Bosch. First ,of course, is \\"everybody counts or nobody counts\\". Another is how he stands up to authority and for his friends.<br /><br />Angels Flight is a very good book- until the end. With all the information he ( Harry ) had and all the people that also knew it, there is absolutely no way that that slime ball Irvin could have put the lid on things. And how about the cops' wife, shouldn't she have been told the truth !?Harry could have somehow leaked the truth but THIS time he did NOT stick up for his friends. Other people in the story ( the Inspector )also knew the truth. And why would anyone protect a murderer just so the department would look good.I was so ticked off last night after finishing this book that I lost sleep.<br /><br />One final comment- IAD ( Internal Affairs ) are exactly as they have been portrayed in these books.
B001VKK78I|5.0|I bought these headphones a few months ago for average use on my computer. Watching youtube videos, listening to music etc... They work great. My uncle has a recording studio and recommended these to me over Sennheisers. I love these headphones. They go around my ears instead of on top of them and sound great. They will eventually make your ears hurt physically after several hours but, in my opinion, most headphones will. These are great for non-professional use if you are on a relatively tight budget.

B002EWD08Q|2.0|It's difficult to describe what an utter disappointment this album was on first listen. I had awaited this release which such anticipation, that I placed my pre-order without the slightest bit of hesitation.  Sure, their second album wasn't quite up to the first, but that's to be expected.  I remember the same thing happened with The Strokes--the second release fell a bit short and yet I still had high hopes for their third album, First Impressions of Earth.  I remember being initially disappointed by that disc, but then came to appreciate it and have listened to it many times since.  Certainly not as good as their first, but a fine recording in its own rite.  Unfortunately, I hold out no such hope for this release--it simply strikes me as trite and unmemorable in every way I consider it.  Most of the tracks strike me as what they used to call \\"Vocal with musical accompaniment.\\"  It's as if they recorded the vocals and then brought in a group of studio musicians to fill them out with some musical background.  I simply can't hear the band on this album.  Think \\"Arctic Monkeys Unplugged.\\" That's not what I care to see or hear.  What has made this band special was the fact that they were so plugged in! I imagine I'll have this back up for sale before long.  Wish I would have waited until the audio samples were available.  Enough said.

B000EGFVQS|2.0|The movie preview for this book looked like something I would enjoy.  The begining was addictive, frightening, and beautiful but around the time her mother left home I lost interest.  I guess I was just expecting something different...more like a mystery or something with suspense but it just dragged on.
0307408833|4.0|The thing I have missed the most about not eating wheat based baked goods is the texture. The recipes in this book come out closer to the texture of wheat products than any other recipe or pre-made gluten free baked good I have tried in the 4 years I've been gluten free. Amazingly light and velvety.    I took a star off for two reasons. I do believe the title is somewhat misleading. And, the ingredients are expensive and hard to find. But be persistent in finding them, because you won't be disappointed. The cupcakes, carrot muffins, and apple toastie recipes have all resulted in delicious goodies.    It is important to note: do not subustitute; make each recipe exactly as written. (Be careful to use garbazno-fava flour, not plain garbanzo. There is a big difference in how the recipe turns out.[[ASIN:B000EDBQ4C Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Garbanzo Fava Flour, 22-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)]]) Also, the author states recipes must be made using dry measure cups for flours, and liquid measure cups for liquids.     I typically do not care for bean flours, but the other flavors used in these recipes do well to hide the bean. The texture is what has me won over, though. If you have been craving light, fluffy cakes and muffins, you owe it to yourself to give these recipes a try.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|I've seen Donnie Darko a handful of times and it is one of the most infuential, amazing, symbolic movies I've ever seen. There's no way to describe this movie or how awesomely well done it was. It's given me a bit different perspective on life, I actually even incorporated Frank the bunny into the tattoo I recently had done because of the impact it had on me and the symbolism I see from it in my life. The movie's all about time travel, and it's not about time travel. It's hard to say. It's about the way it has an effect on life depending on which way you view it but there's just no way of describing it in words. You have to see this movie I have the directors cut and regular version because they were both amazingly done in that the original is awesome and did some things better, but the directors cut adds some explaination that was really good, but the time travel part at the end with the grid and flashing lights didnt make much sense and kind of takes your focus off the purpose of the scene, so advantages and disadvantages in each. See either one or both. Doesnt matter. Excellent movie.

B0000CABBW|3.0|For my assignment I decided to watch The Whale Rider. After reading a brief synopsis on the movie I figured it sounded interesting enough, and decided to watch it. The movie is set in an old Maori Village in New Zealand.  The Maori tribe believed that their ancestors arrived on a whale. The whale is seen by the Maori tribe as sacred and wise. They pray to them and look to them for guidance.  One of the leading characters is a little girl who lives with her grandparents. Pai's twin brother and mother died at birth, so only Pai was left. This deeply disturbed her grandfather who was distraught because her brother was to become chief one day and be the new leader of the tribe. It was as if he blamed Pai for the death of her brother. Pai's father left and went to travel the world, leaving Pai behind with her grandparents. Although the years following Pai's birth, her and her grandfather developed a relationship, she always knew her grandfather still resented her for her brother's death. Pai's father returns for a visit and to the families surprise has a begun a relationship with another woman who is now carrying his child. He and his father get in a fight over bringing them to New Zealand. He insists they will stay in Germany where the mother is from, and to make his father even madder, he tells him they will probably be having a girl. He tells him to take the girl with him (meaning Pai) so he decides Pai is to go with him. Pai reluctantly goes, but does not get very far before she makes her dad turn around and take her back. Meanwhile, her grandfather has decided the tribe has been cursed since the arrival of Pai, and decided he is going to get all of the first born sons of the tribe together, so he can train them, and choose one to be a leader. When Pai returns, hoping her grandfather will be happy she is back, she discovers he is not too happy to see her. Her grandfather starts teaching and training the young boys to see who will be the next leader. Pai stays close,always watching and trying to learn, hoping to get her grandfather's approval. She gets her uncle to train her, but soon is discovered when her and one of the little boys are caught by her grandfather sparring. He of course is none too happy and scolds both of them.  He takes the group of boys out in the ocean (all but the one he scolded) and throws his whale tooth necklace in the water and tells them whoever can bring it back will be the new leader. None of them succeed and the grandfather is crushed. He is deeply depressed and disappointed, and having Pai around seems to make things worse, so her grandmother decides she should go stay with her uncle for a little while. Pai decided to pray to the gods for help, and little does she know they will answer in a big way. While out in the boat one day with her uncle, she decides she is going to get her grandfather's necklace back, and she does. Her uncle gives it to his mother, who decided it is not the right time to give it to him. Pai has a concert at school that she hopes her grandfather will attend because she has named him her hero, on his way there he looks out on to the beach and sees that there are a lot of whales that have beached themselves on the sand. All of the tribe tries to get them back into the ocean, but only fail. Pai tries to help, but her grandfather tells her this is her fault and tells her to go away. As the tribe is walking away to take a break, Pai gets on one of the whales and begins to ride it back in the water. People soon realize the whale is gone, but her grandmother also realized Pai is gone, knowing how much she wants her grandfather's approval, she knows Pai is with the whale.  She gives him the whale tooth necklace and he realizes it is Pai that is the chosen one. Next thing you know they are at the hospital waiting for Pai to wake up. While sitting at her bedside, he prays to her, calling her his leader. At the end of the movie the tribe rides off in a boat that was finally finished (they had stopped building it when Pai was born, because the new leader was to lead the ship). Sitting with her grandfather, Pai leads the tribe out to sea.    One of the key concepts of religion is tradition. All religions revolve around traditions. One of the main themes of this movie was tradition, in the Maori tribe the first born son is to take over as leader of the tribe; this was a tradition that had been passed on from ancestors from many years ago. Along with tradition, there are rules and guidelines that the religions' followers are to adhere to. These rules and guidelines are passed down from ancient ancestors.  The whole movie revolved around this theme. No matter what the religion, there are main themes and concepts. Most religions are started by a group that has similar ideals and beliefs; the Maori tribe was no different. The movie was based on a set of ideals that their ancestors had chosen many years ago, which is a major component in any religion, because of these traditions, ideals, and rules, this movie very much relates to World Religions.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|There's nothing like a good old fashioned western and 'Appaloosa' is no exception with its excellent cast and interesting story.  Harris, Mortensen, Irons and Zellweger add depth to this otherwise familiar story, but I would have liked it to be just a little deeper or slightly shorter. Overall this is a solid western that should please fans of the genre with a nice music score and scenery to round out this tale of commitment, honor and friendship.

B000ION79Y|2.0|Despite the bad reviews, I decided to rent this one and see if it might make a good Sunday afternoon movie to nap too. However, the movie was so bad that I couldn't even sleep to it - LOL!! There is extensive dubbing of Seagal's voice, and the \\"actor\\" they got to dub Seagal's voice isn't even close. Not to mention that I'm not talking about his voice being dubbed when he's not facing the camera or something somewhat undetectable. There are 5-minute long conversations with the camera facing him where the entire conversation is dubbed. It's like watching some dubbed Asian flick from the 70's and not in a good way!! I'd say about 40% of his lines were dubbed in this way - really bad!!<br /><br />The story seems interesting on the outset - a drug called CTX has the capacity to give people super-human strength, so the military is interested in it for their own purposes, there is a \\"drug-cartel\\" that is also interested in apparently trafficking the drug, there is a rogue military group interested in the drug, and the French police are investigating deaths as a result of the drug. However, the story doesn't really go anywhere from here and the scenes where people are fighting it out are so confusing you are not sure which group is killing which group, you just see that a bunch of people are dying.<br /><br />The drug has a sort of side effect I guess which makes peoples eyes turn into something that looks like it was stolen from Men in Black. You know, where Will Smith's character chases that guy down on foot at the opening of the movie - remember that? And his eyes are like the gills on a fish, blinking. That was okay though. What was really funny is that the drug also makes people have a metal knife that protrudes from their hand, which they use to slice open their victims. How exactly does that happen?! How does a drug make you grow a metal knife shaped object coming out of your hand? LOL, stupid!!<br /><br />The ending was really bad - of course there is a big fight and everyone dies but Seagal and his little Japanese sidekick, but so what! Does that mean the military has given up on trying to kill Seagal? Earlier in the movie he killed a similar kind of military death squad and they just sent another death squad after him. So now that he killed this second squad, they are just going to give up?! The whole part about Seagal's character being part of the \\"good military\\" and the \\"bad military\\" was trying to kill him, was a little ridiculous and hard to follow.<br /><br />You don't see Seagal using any of his Aikido really, it's just fake digitally-enhanced fighting scenes, though there were a couple of decent military-style shoot-outs. But overall this was one of the worst Seagal flicks I've ever seen, though still better than \\"Kill Switch\\" or \\"Against the Dark.\\" But I'm guessing this is one Seagal would like to have back or at least take his name off of, then again sometimes I think it's just a paycheck for him and he really doesn't care anymore.gal and his little Japanese sidekick, but so what!

I feel the album merits consideration to purchase, and it surely gives my 5.1 system a workout.
B000J0UD94|4.0|I have to agree with those reviews who found Gerard Depardieu's portrayal of Columbus to be semi-incomprehensible. The fact that his first name and my family's last name are the same -- despite my Scottish pronunciation of the same -- did not allow me to be disposed to favor him in this role. I am a fan of Ridley Scott and was impressed, as usual, with the texture and costumes of this film. But why was the excellent actor Armand Assante not given the role of the historical figure who discovered the new world -- after the Vikings, that is? -- the explorer whose name is revered in elementary school in America? Surely, Assante could have carried the role, or is he only thought of as being a character actor who crops up only in supporting roles these days?<br /><br />I don't mean to be bigoted against the French, but why is Monsieur Depardieu so highly regarded as an actor? As Cyrano. . . okay. As one of the Three Musketeers . . . superb. Those are well-known French literary figures. But as Christopher Columbus. . . why?<br /><br />This film, Scott's 1492 CONQUEST OF PARADISE, reveals the aftermath of Columbus' discovery of San Salvadore -- even his eventual prison sentence. Fortunately, as the afterward reveals, Columbus was awarded the acclaim he deserved because of his son's written account of the discovery and it's earth-shaking ramifications. We see Columbus as both a successful explorer and as a tragic figure, caught up in events during trying times of the Spanish Inquisition. The other Columbus film released at the time (1992), directed by one of the many James Bond film directors and featuring two former James Bond villains from LICENSE TO KILL, was the version I was seeking for my Chinese students here in the People's Republic. Unfortunately, it was unavailable. Fortunately, I have the artistic vision of Terrence Malick in the extended version of THE NEW WORLD to use in a history lesson for our country.<br /><br />As a work of art on the screen, 1492 deserves special acclaim. As for its casting. . . well. sorry, Gerard. Italian, you ain't.its casting. . . well. sorry, Gerard. Italian, you ain't.

0307341569|5.0|In \\"Dark Places,\\" by Gillian Flynn, thirty-one year old Libby Day survived a \\"prairie massacre\\" that took place on the night of January 2, 1985, when she was just seven years old.  In Libby's Kansas farmhouse, three people were slaughtered--her sisters, ten-year-old Michelle and nine-year-old Debby, and her thirty-two year old mother, Patty.  Libby's brother, Ben, was a troubled fifteen-year-old boy at the time, and he was convicted of the crime.  He has spent almost two and a half decades in the Kinnakee Kansas State Penitentiary and has never appealed his sentence.  Libby, whose sworn testimony helped convict her brother, has not contacted him since he was imprisoned.<br /><br />Libby, the sardonic and cynical first person narrator, is convinced that her blood is tainted and that she has nothing to live for. She lives in Missouri in a rented bungalow, where she hides from the world and wallows in her misery.  She morosely states, \\"Little Orphan Libby grew up sullen and boneless, shuffled around a group of lesser relatives.... I was not a lovable child, and I'd grown into a deeply unlovable adult.\\"  She swipes objects wherever she goes, and looks for ways to make money without having to work for it. We cannot help but pity her and hope that she can somehow find the peace of mind that has eluded her.<br /><br />Everything changes when someone named Lyle Wirth contacts Libby with a business proposition.  He belongs to a group of true crime junkies and amateur detectives called the Kill Club, and they will gladly pay Libby to speak to them.  Desperate for money and reluctant to get a job, Libby accepts Lyle's invitation.  After meeting with the club, all of whom are convinced that Ben is innocent, Libby is offered more money to interview witnesses who might shed light on what really happened to her family.  Reluctantly, Libby agrees, and her investigation gradually opens her eyes to a horrifying realization.  No one has ever told the whole truth about this gruesome case.<br /><br />\\"Dark Places\\" is a compelling novel in which Flynn keeps us hooked by going back and forth from the events of 1985 to the present day.  Flynn juxtaposes Libby's efforts to track down various people of interest with riveting flashbacks from Ben's and, occasionally, Patty's point of view.  The dialogue, descriptive writing, and plotting are all impeccable.  Flynn meticulously depicts the hardscrabble life of an impoverished and desperate farm family that can never get out of debt.  The lot of the unlucky Days is made even worse by a drunken bum of a father who is constantly looking for handouts instead of supporting his children.  Ben is angry and frustrated by his poverty and lack of opportunity, and he unwisely hooks up with a wild young woman and her devil-worshipping friend, both of whom toy with his emotions.  The last quarter of the book is excruciatingly suspenseful and most readers will find it impossible to put down \\"Dark Places\\" until they find out exactly who killed Debby, Michelle, and Patty Day.k Places\\" is a compelling novel in which Flynn keeps us hooked by going back and forth from the events of 1985 to the present day.

B00005NTN5|5.0|This is a refreshing, overlooked noir classic by the Wachowski brothers of MATRIX fame. Glued to my seat at the theatre for this one. Simple gangster tale but different as it is done with a modern-day stroke of the brush and effrontery---two gay femmes being the smart alecks. All about a gangster and his moll, the former accountable for the pick-up and timely delivery of a huge sum of mob money to big kahuna gang boss who's flying in to make the pick-up personally. Slight problem as gangster's lady conspires with female plumber/handy-\\"man\\" working in their building to steal the cash and place the blame on gangland incompetence. Major problem as the boy[s] responsible for the loss will have to pay with their heads---Mafia style. The gangster responsible for the cash is played by an always engaging pre-SOPRANOS Joe Pantoliano [as Caesar] who gives a MEMORABLE and RIVETING performance and basically steals the show [though not the money]. His back-stabbing babe is played perturbingly well by Jennifer Tilly and the pipe-cleaner [no pun intended] is played convincingly well by Gina Gershon. Christopher Meloni as Johnnie Marzzone [pre- LAW AND ORDER and OZ] is ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS as the son of Mafia boss Gino Marzzone. Johnnie and Caesar despise each other, mainly the result of mutual envy and the fact that Johnnie has tunnel-vision for Caesar's lady. Their antagonistic banter is loads of fun. All hell breaks loose once Caesar returns home with the cash only to have it disappear. He knows this is a death sentence. Spurred on by Tilly's subterfuge Caesar goes into a paranoid frenzy as the clock ticks for Don Gino's arrival. Very tense and suspenseful action here as Caeasar cracks and starts dispatching prime suspects of the theft starting with Johnnie and ending with the purgative and unexpected execution of the Don himself---this the point of no return. With bodies starting to pile up in his bathtub the cops come knocking on his door in response to a neighbor's complaint of hearing gunfire. Got to see the rest yourself. Wince-inducing \\"ask-ya-ten-times\\" bathroom scene with a guy losing a finger each time he doesn't come up with the desired answer is brutal. The whispering femme fatale Tilly and beer-guzzling Gershon quite a pair as they heat up the tension, Pantoliano's temper and themselves. Highly recommended.of hearing gunfire.

B001YYQ9SS|1.0|I watched the Japanese Blu-Ray on my PS3 (This Special Edition version only available in Japan came with a demo of Final Fantasy XIII! Wooot! Too bad ya fools can't read Japanese as all the text and menus are only Japanese)       I started the movie with an open mind. I love the game (In fact I am playing it again, and it still rocks).  I have seen the trailers and knew this movie was going to be all visuals and very little else. On a visual aspect, Advent Children is stunning, and is far better on Blu-Ray.  You got to be smoking rocks to think other wise (or have the wrong setup).       The movie its self was worse than I expected. Halfway through the movie I was just bored out of my mind, then I tortured my self by watching another hour towards the end. In fact it was so bad, I categorize it as one of the worst movies i have seen. It's works as a good tech demo to test your home theater gear out, and get your inner geek on.  But as actual entertainment, it falls flat in every possible way.       If you don't believe me watch advent children after you have watched animation master pieces such as Princess Mononoke, Akira, Jinro     If you like more family friendly shows:  Miyazaki's Spirited Away, Castle In the Sky, and Kiki's Deleivery service (Mononoke is also Miyazaki film but may be too violent and scary for young children)    Advent as a Movie for Movie lover not a geeky video game fanatic is just plain pathetic waste of time.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michaels provides a comprehensive 20 minute workout that really works. Her constant commentary, far from being distracting is motivational and instructive. The DVD is split into 3 levels, each level comprising one 20 minute workout. This is a great product and I haven't even got to Level 3 yet. If you are looking for an exercise DVD that you won't easily tire from, this may be the one for you.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|It really doesn't get much simpler. They snap right on and you're good to go. I have not had any problems with the triggers falling off or breaking as some have said but I am usually pretty easy on stuff. The feel of the triggers really improves the overall function of the controller itself. If you've got an extra 5 bucks laying around, there's no reason not to pick these up.
B001HN69AE|3.0|This movie is Not like the anime.  The movie is very short so it takes a tongue and cheek perspective of DBZ.  Sure the the movie can be corny and special efects unrealistic, but that's the Idea.  Stephen Chow is a genius at making quirky toung and cheek martial arts action movies.  If you think this move was corny then you have not watched Shaolin Soccer, which was his break out movie to international stardom.      I like DBZ evolution.  it's funny, witty, and lots of action.  If you are watching the movie and saying \\"Goku did not do this, Picolo did not do that, or that so not like the cartoon\\"  then you are too DBZ fanatic for this movie and will not even give it a chance.  I have seen actual DBZ movies such as Broly, Super Android 13, Tree of Might, Dead Zone, World's Strongest.  The older movies were good. But Broly and Android 13 are just plain awful movies, and the later movies are even worse.  DBZ evolution is more accessible to non anime watching people, and is entertaining.      DBZ Fanboys hate this movie because it's not like DBZ cartoon, no mater how fun it is, just as FF7 fanboys love Advent Children because it has their beloved characters from the game are in there unchanged eventhough the movie tanks in the fun department.

0316010669|4.0|Quite a read.  Not exactly a page-turner for me, but still very interesting. The act of \\"thin-slicing\\", or should I say the ability to do it is fascinating. Buy the book! I can see me going back to this one to re-read certain sections.
B00005JLD4|4.0|This movie takes place in western Australia 1931 where the government gave themselves  power over the aboriginal people.  The story focuses on Molly, Daisy and Gracie, half-caste children who are seized from their parents and sent to a \\"camp\\" or \\"school\\" where they are put to work and taught Christian songs and practices. They run away from this establishment they are forced to inhabit.  They follow this rabbit-proof fence that runs the length of the country back to their family. The enjoyable movie  follows the simple story of these strong young girls as they try and make their way home.   Religion is a central focus of this lovely story.  These people are persecuted for their different color skin and religious ways.  The great spirituality of these people is displayed in the chants and prayers they say to get the children home and help them on their way.  Their belief in Animism is represented by the spirit eagle their mother teaches them about and it comforts them in their journey home.
B000NVADJY|5.0|I checked this book out from the library today after being drawn to it.  I must say that this is a very beautifully written book about a woman who shared some interesting insights she gleaned from her near death experience.  One of the wonderful insights that I gleaned from what she shared is on page 58 and 59 that she learns during hear near death experience that imagination is the key to reality.  It was interesting for her to also note that simply by thinking positive thoughts and speaking positive words we attract positive energy.  Also interesting she shares how some people come to earth with their powers of imagination already developed.  She then adds detail to note that  there are  gifted people who are able to use their imaginations to create new things: both wonderful and its opposite.  She also elaborates on this helpful tidbit by mentioning that  the ones who use their gifted imaginations in positive ways to the betterment of those around them truly create joy and are blessed.  She also shares other interesting information in the book.  What I included in the review is just a taster.  All in all I would definitely have to say that this book about her near death experience was written in an interesting way with much love and light.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|The last of the true divas has come to let those that are pretending know how it is really done. She knew the voice was not in its 20s or 30s anymore.  She gathered what she has to work with and interrupted the song only the way that Whitney Houston can. This album/cd is solid and not one song is worth skipping. To all the haters, this ain't for you to read or listen to baby. LOL, do it Whitney!
0312370849|5.0|I have been reading a bit about this subject but especially enjoyed this novel.  It was a captivating story that couldn't be put down and was so historically informative.

B001FB4W0M|5.0|I've read a few reviews complaining about the quality of the Blu-ray transfer, but honestly I don't see it. I've watched the first disc so far and the quality looks excellent to me. If you want a technical review of the video, check out the DVD review on [...]. I don't get too involved in the technical stuff when it comes to picture and sound, but I have an appreciation for the quality of high definition TV and Blu-ray, and I have no complaints in the quality of this set.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|[REC] is a wonderful return to horror movies that use suspense to pull you in.  There has been a lot of commentary already about how this mimics the camera style of other films (note: Those who say it copies \\"Cloverfield\\" have it backwards as [REC] was made in 07 and \\"Cloverfield\\" in 08, so if anyone was copying...)  The performances are spot on. They follow my one rule of horror movies: Do they make decisions that normal people might under the circumstances.  Don't rent/buy \\"Quarantine\\"...see the original!

078322947X|5.0|A truly great movie.      Just in case you haven't read the other reviews, a partial summary of the plot: the movie revolves around 4 losers who have committed some kind of major mistake in their life.  These mistakes are shown by what are essentially 4 separate opening vignettes. Then in order to escape the consequences of their actions, they have ran away and end up in HELL!  Hell is a small really crappy South American town from which they have almost no chance of escape. It is in this hell that the four losers are brought together.  Then if they brave almost certain death, they are offered a slim chance of redemption and an escape from this self made hell.  Watch the movie to learn the rest.    The other reviews may talk about comparison to the original classic french film.  Others may discuss the director and the production problems.  What they all miss and don't discuss is the realism of this movie.  All you have to do is watch this movie and you'll be convinced that they are truly in hell.  The prettiest looking woman in town next to a toothless used up prostitute is the drawing of a woman on an old coca-cola tray.  Even then when these losers stare at the tray it is open to question as to whether they lust more for this imaginary woman or the ice cold coke next to her. The hopelessness of their initial situation is made quite clear as is the fact that unless presented with a miracle this is a self created hell from which there is no escape.      This is not a movie for people who go to the cinema for escape and good feelings.  This is not a chick flick where you cry twice and rejoice in a happy ending.  This is a movie for those of us who are tired of such films and enjoy the total realism of this movie.    And the best thing of all is that the stark realism never lets up.  Even when you think the hero(?) of the movie has escaped from his self made hell, there is one last surprise.    God, I love this movie.
0545123267|3.0|In all honesty, I would have probably rated this book to be a 2 stars or 2.5 stars but I gave it a little leeway because it is the first book of a series. Okay, onto the review. Shiver is a tale about a human girl is fascinated with wolves, one wolf in particular and this wolf is actually a boy who changes from wolf to human according to the temperatures. When it is colder, he changes into a wolf and when it is warmer he changes back into a human but the number of transformations are limited to a point where a werewolf eventually has their last winter before they permanently stay wolf but it varies from werewolf to werewolf. In this tale, Sam - the male lead - is in his last winter before he changes permanently.     There were some good things I liked about this book but there were also a lot of bad things. I will start with the good things. Maggie Stiefvater wrote a very lyrical story and the characters were kind of likeable. The pacing was pretty good and the suspense of the `will this be Sam's last winter' was decent. Honestly, it would have been a more dramatic, meaningful impact if it had been Sam's last winter. You know the idea of winter bringing you your first love and winter taking it away would have extremely bittersweet tale. But that's just me.     Okay, onto the bad. Even though the characters were somewhat likeable, their actions seriously made me scratch my head. Why or how did Grace and Sam fall in love with each other? Okay, so they had been infatuated with each other for years - Grace infatuated with Sam in his wolf form and Sam infatuated with her but that's it. It's like `I find you on my doorstep! OMG, you are my wolf with yellow eyes, sleep in my room for weeks and weeks without my parents having a clue because they won't give me a time of day.' It was like that. The first time they actually mean each other, the same night they are sleeping in the same bed each other to keep him warm ... WTF? And it didn't take too long before they were dating.As for Grace's parents, they are like a replica of parents in every other teen paranormal romance novel that are out on the shelves. Absence the majority of the time from the book or if they aren't absence they are there but not really `there', oh and their kid does everything for them - cleans the house, takes out the trash, washes the clothes, makes dinner - without a single thank you. Can we please have more active parents in these kinds of stories? I mean I am not a parent - and I won't be for a long while - but it is just so annoying to see parents portrayed as they don't give a damn and they just had a kid who was meant to be their little Cinderella so Prince Charming or in this case, the Big Bad Wolf is there to save them. And this story portrays exactly that! Here is an exact quote:     `He looked away. \\"Only thing I wonder, is ... did you have s--make love - to me to get back at your parents?\\"'    Hm, now why in the world would he think that?     Anyways, the antagonists of the story weren't really antagonists ... I actually felt bad for them! It's kind of sad that I felt sympathy towards the antagonists more so than the lead couple. I mean throughout the whole story, it was pretty much about Grace making sure that everything was at a good warm temperature so Sam wouldn't change and if it wasn't that, then Sam - being the artistic guy that he is - would be thinking up corny lyrics about his girlfriend.     In conclusion, even though I was a tad harsh in this review, I think this series has a lot of potential. I know for a fact that Maggie Stiefvater is writing a sequel to this, so I will most likely read it. But honestly, I think this would have done much better as a stand-alone with a bittersweet ending.
0307454541|3.0|Because my bookclub picked it I read the whole thing just to make sure it was a waste of my time.  I'm not a fiction or murder mystery fan and if this bookclub keeps picking along this line, I'll consider a better use of my time.  It is a smartly written novel with enough complexity and interest to satisfy the need for entertainment.  I found it a page turner and also found myself quickly skimming and omitting some of the pages that went off on a tangent.  The characters were unrealistic.  But still, I did like the heroine Lisbeth with her troubled past still unrevealed at the end to tempt us to pick up the sequel.  What I didn't like was the sexual violence and the screenplay characters and structure.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|WALL-E is an animated film about a lonely robot (named Wall-E) left to clean up an earth devoid of people that meets a female robot, named Eva, and chases her into space to be by her side. The travails our hero goes through in an alien world run the range of human emotions and technical imagination in this tour de force of both film and animation.<br /><br />This movie apparently came from the same crowd that brought TOY STORY some years back, another animation about computer-generated toys with human emotions. What WALL-E shows is that two robots can tell us more about ourselves and what makes us human than the best films about relationships and entranglements.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the animation in this movie is spectacular. I'm not much for animation and this is certainly the best film of that type I've ever seen. It must have impressed others, too, since it had the greatest weekend opening ever for an animation and won both the 2008 Academy and Golden Globe awards for animated feature.<br /><br />But it is far more than animation; it is a movie about us -- all of us. This is a movie for adventurers, intellectuals, sci-fi fans, families, children and just about anyone else. If you like movies of any kind, there is absolutely no reason not to see this film.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|First, yet me said that when I bought this collection it was for the sole intention of paying tribute to Michael Jackson; although now I recieve a greater reward then I could ever imagine or even know of.  Buying this case was important to me towards finding out all, or at least most of his greatest hits; instead of buying each individual case buy it self. The ultimate collection is five CD's with a small book chrologically Michael Jackson career. When you open up the case, from the first CD on the left hand side to the fourth on the right hand side, give off some of Michael's best works and collaborations, including the Jackson's 5 \\"ABC\\", \\"Thriller\\", and \\"You are not Alone\\".  The last CD came as a unexpected surprise as it was an actually dvd of Michael Jackson Bad tour.         What I would have like to known of before purchasing this collection, is how  long the fifth cd/dvd would be;instead of finding out through watching it for two and a half hours.  Overall, I enjoy the music, and dvd with a greater appreciaton for Michael Jackson work than from one, or two Michael Jackson videos seen on televison.

0757302661|5.0|I can't imagine laboring any other way! Hypnobirthing techniques really work to ease labor pains. I read the book and took the class at my hospital for my first pregnancy. Unfortunately, my son was breech and was a scheduled c-section. I did the techniques on my own during my second pregnancy and was able to deliver a healthy baby girl via VBAC. The doctor and nurses kept coming into the room shocked at how calmly things were progressing because they could tell on the monitor that my contractions were getting stronger. Whenever I came out of relaxation, I immediately felt nauseous. I would highly recommend trying this technique. Even if you can't use it during labor, it's great for quelling fears during pregnancy. I'm buying it again for my third pregnancy.
1604244674|4.0|The picture of Dorian Gray may have been shocking for its taboo innuendoes when it was first published late in the 19th century, but to a modern reader, almost seeking out an element of that shameful pleasure a well written novel of vanity and desire might evoke, such a thrill-seeker will be a bit disappointed here.  That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"<br /><br />The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable.  Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.<br /><br />The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts.  Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read.  As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity.  Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray?  If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.<br /><br />This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into.  There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|Good action flick, which gets it the second star, but I reject entirely the revisionist history of Star Trek, which keeps it from getting more than two.
B00005NUZN|1.0|I would love to give a review for this product, but I can't because I never received it from the seller.  I'm not sure whether or not it was shipped, or if it got lost in transit, but I never received it.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|This is the CD I've been hopping for from one of the most gifted singers EVER.The record start outs with the wonderfull dance cut,\\"Million Dollar Bill.\\"Whitney sang this live on GMA,and the audience went Wild.  Most of the CD has this type of sound,but the ballads are here also.\\"My favorite one is \\"I look to you.\\" This song really touches your heart and soul,the same way \\"I will always love you,\\"and \\"The greatest love of all.\\"  I was amazed when I heard the Carpenters,\\"A Song for You.\\" It starts out like another wonderfull ballad,but turns into a diso song,and its fantastic.  \\"Like I never left\\" is another one of my favorites,but \\"I got you\\" is the number I like even more.There's not ONE track on this record thats a filler.  This CD is truely a great comeback,and I'm sure its not the last from this gifted singer.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|this collectors dvd-box is outstanding. the mix of narrative and documentary film-style is very entertaining. the production is without a doubt state of the art.  if you are interested in \\"human history in space\\" this item is a must for your dvd-library.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Amazon.com needs to seperate reviews.  Blu ray reviews should NOT be lumped in with standard dvd releases.  The blu ray version of this movie is far superior to the standard dvd version. Both in picture and sound quality. The movie itself features great performances from the whole cast inlcluding the late Oliver Reed who died in Italy right as this was being finished.  The fictional story of the evil emporer Commodus and his betrayel of his top general is a interesting one.  In real life Rome had just had a number of great emporers : Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian and then Marcus Aurelius who was Commodus's father. All of these men had fought on the frontiers and made the empire strong , they were excellent emporers and then came the degenerate partier Commodus.  He fought in the gladitioral games and spent the empires money on his desires while the frontiers were being attacked.  He was cruel and finally killed and that was a good thing for the world.  But he was in charge for many years and not a few months like in this movie.  Still the movie captures his evil nature very well as does the actor who protays him,  and it presents a story about revenge.  This is a good movie in spite of this historical misstep.  After all they couldn't have the main character fight for ten years waiting for revenge.  On blu ray this movie really comes alive and from this point on is the only way to watch it.

B0000CABBW|4.0|Whale Rider involves a young girl, Pai that survived the birth after the passing of her twin brother and mother. Due to being a girl, she is disowned by her grandfather for not being able to obtain the ritual inheritance of the Maori tribe, descendants of the legendary Paikea, who arrived from Hawaaki `riding on a whale'. In desperation for acceptance she sneaks around her grandfather's all male initiation camp to learn the ways of becoming a wise leader. Through her grandfather's failure as \\"wise leader\\" to pass on his inheritance to any one boy in the camp, the sacred symbol \\"whale tooth\\" is lost for what he deems forever. Now it's up to the whales to decide who will be the chosen leader.     Out of desperation to be accepted by her grandfather and following descendants, Pai so skillfully calls on the whales in asking for acceptance. A large herd of whales answers by fleeing to the shores of this coastal, fishing community. The whole Maori tribe flees to save these symbolic creatures. The grandfather, still not understanding \\"who's to blame\\" seeks to remove them from the mainline shore. When all attempts fail by the whole community, Pai finally realizes that her time has come. Through faith of her eternal calling she is given the opportunity to save the whales and the heritage of the Maori tribe; thus turning her grandfather's disregard into acceptance. A very informative film on the customs and rituals many even today still strive to overcome.    In relation to our world religions, it shows the comparison of how male dominance is still such as issue for many beliefs yet how far we've come even in today's society. Norms of marrying within your `tribe or race' is dominant even today as this movie will show. All people of different faiths are striving to become accepted in some form or another. With time and dedication this movie will show the important relations in applying what one can learn to everyday world religions.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|A brilliant script with many memorable lines delivered by Clint, most of which are not suitable to print here.  The story is touching and illuminating.  Fine acting is the other ingredient to this wonderful film about people... about ourselves.  The film touches on a vast many aspects of life including growing old, family, gang violence, prejudices, life, death, etc. So many in fact, it may seem like a mishmash to some, but the story knits them together well.<br /><br />Sitting at the opposite end of the spectrum from some earlier films such \\"Every Which Way But Loose\\", this is among Eastwood's more cerebral films.  Although rated R for very strong language and violence, it is not an action adventure film but rather a thought provoking film along the lines of \\"Unforgiven\\".<br /><br />My only minor constructive criticism is that the first act moves a little slow and the film does not develop its momentum until about ten minutes in.  Perhaps the opening scenes could have been cut a little tighter.<br /><br />Bottom line, I enjoyed this film and highly recommend it.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I have not seen BL since it came out, at which time I watched it in the theater at least ten times.  I was appalled, thrilled, baffled and fascinated.  I remember it as the most realistic movie I've ever seen, and not most of all in the sense of its exquisite mise-en-scene and famed candelit scenes.  So in what way realistic?  We watch a man -- a very ordinary, rather shoddy man -- live his life.  At the end of the movie, he dies.  That's all that happens. What makes the movie almost unbearably powerful is that it has no point and no moral; it might be said to have no point of view.  Even Barry Lyndon has no apparent point of view about his life.  There is no satisfaction at the end.  The only meaning to be found in Barry Lyndon's life is what the viewer imposes on it.  This ethical vacuum creates intense discomfort and a pressing need to fill it with an interpretation.  Therein is the beauty and the satisfaction of it, if any. Some viewers and critics rejected BL as empty and boring; others supplied their own reading of it; for me, and I can't speak for anyone else, the agonizing pleasure of the movie lay in the tension it created between meaning and non-meaning.  For the duration of the movie, I experienced both the shock of the void and the drive to fill it with a narrative; holding my mind in that space, yielding to neither the urge to flee nor the urge to moralize, was mesmerizing and transformative.
0385340990|4.0|This book was recommended to me and I am always eager for a new read. After the first few pages, I started to wonder when the letter writing would end and the real story would start. I had not realized the entire book is a story told in letters between a few of the main characters. Once I realized the letters ARE the book, I enjoyed the book a little more since I was not awaiting a shift of format or voice. By the halfway point, I was hooked. It seemed obvious to me that some letters were missing, which added to the charm of the tale. The characters were imperfect and ones you'd envision knowing not glossy images of fiction that seem untouched by 'real life'. The World War II details were interesting and even more so since I was reading the book while in a city in France nearly completely destroyed at the time when the book's story took place. By the end, I was wishing there was more to the novel. All wonder and enjoyment aside, I wished the physical descriptions were as detailed as the emotional ones. The maps in the front of the book added a dose of reality though I wish the map of Guernsey included points of interest, like the main character's cottages and such.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an old-fashioned letter or stories about the lives touched by WWII. Would make for a great book club read. Sad that the primary author did not survive to see the success of this book, but it really is a nice reminder that she still had the joy of creating it.
B000HT3Q14|4.0|Writer/director Terry Gilliam's output has been uneven,sometimes he has a winner like \\"Time Bandits\\" or \\"The Fisher King\\" and other times the results can be wildly uneven like \\"Brazil\\"- a film I found wildly confusing or \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" which I found incomphrensible despite the efforts of Johnny Depp and Benicio DelToro. But this sci-fier bears none of those faults for I was completely engrossed in what was happening in the story.  It also boasts great performances from Bruce Willis and an Oscar nominated one from Brad Pitt as a schizophrenic patient. I don't want to reveal too much of the plot but if you're into time travel movies--this ones for you.  I will probably purchase this in HD DVD since it is so ridiculously so low that it makes the price in Blu-ray to be a crime!!  By the way, this film is based or inspired by the French film, \\"La Jetee\\".

B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is one of the most intense films to cover the Vietnam era, but from a totally different perspective!  I served in Vietnam, grew up in the sixties, but never experienced the drug culture, demonstrations and uprisings that were so predominent during those times.  I greatly enjoy the Beatles and their music, but never heard the words as I have now through this movie.  The way in which the music and its lines were woven into a theme with real characters was truly amazing!
0439023483|5.0|Absolutely astounding.  From almost the first page to the last, Collins demonstrates a narrative sweep that i could only compare to Ian Fleming in her ability to keep the tension high, while keeping the reader guessing all the way to the end.  Her well drawn characters, ear for dialog, and tight, tight narration make this an absolute must read.  I would compare this first effort with Thirteen Moons by Charles Frazier, Benioff's City of Thieves, or Deathly Hallows-can't wait for the sequel.  Don't miss this book!  Would NOT advise for the younger crowd though-not for the faint of heart; this book deals with very intense themes.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until I saw it highly ranked on Amazon Video on Demand.  I watched the trailer and figured I'd give it a whirl on a quiet afternoon.    Wow was I impressed.  This is a really great movie, I don't know how I'd never heard of it before.  For starers, it's better than any action movie I've seen in a while (I'm looking at you Revenge of the Fallen).  The story is great, and reasonable.  The special effects are used well, and fit in the with the story, they aren't just there for the sake of being there. The movie has a great pace to it too, so you'll be sucked in quickly.    Seriously check it out, I think I'm going to pick it up on BluRay.

B002M5ZCEU|5.0|Whitney Houston's new album was well worth the wait.  It's current but still keeps with her classic tastes for great melodies and lyrics.  This album has many radio ready/friendly tracks.  There is definitely something on this album for the old fans and new ones alike.  The voice is unmistakable, strong, triumphant and soulful.  You actually hear Whitney tell a story through this album.  I have a feeling it will be another historic album for her and a must have for anyone who enjoys great singing and soulful R&b/pop at it's best.
B002752ZHM|5.0|First let me say that I love everything that Quincy Jones does!  And I'd like to be the first person to review this disc.   Then I'd like to say there is not a mediocre cut on this disc. Even the one that   you think are after a second listen you hear the artistry in every artist and the band.Listen to Paul Jackson Jr.play the blues on One Mint Juleps (He's crazy). And Naturally 7's Wall Of Sound is undeniable, Herbie Hancock, Al Jarreau, Patti Austin and Chaka Khan on Miss Celie's Blues is good as it gets.   All the artist and band are all pro's that are at the top of their game.   Quincy Jone has always been in his prime and he's not letting up and I defy anyone to say otherwise.
0783240287|1.0|This show is nearly unwatchable.  It's that bad.      I love the story of Joseph, and I when I first saw it on stage I had tears in my eyes.  It's a timeless tale of faith & forgiveness.  So, I was excited when I saw this on Netflix and decided to watch it.  Unfortunately, the over-the-top makeup & bad acting, simply doesn't do this story justice.  Maybe this story is best viewed on stage.  Or maybe this is just a plain BAD movie.      Do yourself a favor, and watch for this play to come to your town.  Find a date, or take your family, and trust this reviewer:  You'll see, hear, and feel a story that's magical.  Don't ruin it by watching this DVD.      Sometimes it's put on by a Broadway production, sometimes by one of the schools or various stage organizations.  I've seen it 3 times now.  Twice by 2 different \\"Christian Youth Theater\\" Groups (High School kids), and once by a Broadway production.  The CYT production was better than the Broadway production.  Those kids could really sing, and were very creative with the various skits.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Tom Selleck does a great job at bringing the character from the book to the screen!  If you are a fan of Tom Selleck, or the book, you will not be disappointed!  I think Selleck is the perfect actor to play this part.  Great story that leaves you wanting to watch all of the movies in this series!
B0015DROBO|5.0|What a great book.  When are the next two available?  This is great writing.  I just finished a marathon reading day and if the next one was available I'd start right over!
B001EN71DQ|5.0|I really just want to take a few paragraphs to let you know what this product is.    Basically, each of these movies got a 2-disc release when they were released on DVD.  This box set has taken those 2-disc sets, and packaged them into a smaller case so in order to minimize shelf space.  The \\"Original Trilogy\\" (Episodes 4-6) slimset is a debatable purchase, because it doesn't include the bonus disc that came with an earlier deluxe set.  But this \\"Prequel Trilogy\\" is a better deal if you're planning to buy these movies.    As for the extras:  *  I love \\"The Phantom Menace\\" content, especially the 90-minute making-of documentary that shows everything from cast readings to sandstorm carnage to special effects meetings to George Lucas quietly beginning his \\"Episode II\\" writing.  And say what you will about the quality of the movie, but Fox and LucasFilm did an excellent job of advertising this movie.  Even its promotional extras are worth watching.    *  \\"Attack of the Clones\\" is another solid batch of extras.  They mostly focus on the special effects, but there are some good interviews and behind-the-scenes stuff with the cast.  Another all-around strong package.    *  I'm slightly disappointed with the \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" extras.  The main documentary is producer Rick McCallum going through the different departments of the cast & crew.  He even talks about the caterers!  Now, this is a fascinating way to explore the making of a movie, but the problem is most of the content (especially the special effects clips) focuses on the Mustafar sequences.  I would've loved to see more on the opening space battle, not to mention Kyshhykk (sp?) or General Grievious.  The bonus disc is good enough, but a huge stepdown from the other two prequels' material.    So, if you want to buy the \\"Prequel Trilogy\\", this is the way to go.  Sure, you can probably find some cheaper copies of the original releases, but why bother?    Oh by the way, \\"YES!  I LIKE THE PREQUEL TRILOGY.  I PREFEREPISODES 4-6, BUT 1-3 WERE QUITE ENTERTAINING FOR ME.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This charming quintessential 16th century period piece showcases the talents of Drew Barrymore, Dougray Scott, and Anjelica Huston among others. If you appreciate a european influence you will enjoy this fast moving romance/adventure-drama set amid the French provincial countryside. Heartwarming scenes such as the character Maurice returning to the arms of his fellow-servant family amid the rustic french-farm countryside, or the prince rescuing a valuable painting after falling over a cliff into a river, and of course the gypsies fencing, who also subsequently are invited to the \\"mask\\", the costume ball celebrating the future nuptials of the prince. Intrigue, humor, romance, drama and adventure await anyone seeking a story although often told, but not out of date. I enjoyed it not only for these reasons, but also because it is suitable for every member of the family. Excellent introduction by french actress Jeanne Moreau.
1594202249|4.0|Thomas Pynchon's latest novel, Inherent Vice, is a \\"part noir, part psychedelic\\" detective story that plunges readers yet again into the author's wacky world of lists and staggering ideas.  This time though, the author decides to stave readers off the mind-numbing mental calories that decorated colossal powerhouses like V, Gravity's Rainbow, Mason & Dixon, and Against the Day.  In a grain that runs along his eighties romp Vineland and the more succinct The Crying of Lot 49, Inherent Vice is parenthetically steeped in the countercultural sixties and seventies--an angst-ridden zeitgeist of paisleys, phony afros, narcs, hippies, psychedelic joints, flashy neons, surfers, copasetic chicks, dopey dudes, rock-and-roll, stellular sex, hallucinogenic doobies, and a plethora of tubular US subculture allusions--packed within a brisk narrative riddled with his usual raunchy and hilarious lyrics and acronyms, farcical character names, and snappy dialogue.      Some critics and avid fans have labeled this novel Pynchon Lite, a term that carries slightly negative connotations for readers acclimated to the author's injections of chemistry, physics, and mathematical equations and theorems; probing philosophical concepts; and juxtapositions of chaos and order within systems.  In an uncharacteristic slant on style and content, however, Inherent Vice does away with the macrocosmic and presents a downscaled version of his dabbling with such complexities in a detective thriller of surreal \\"hippie metaphysics.\\"  But Pynchon wrote it, so it is no ordinary detective thriller.  Ostensibly, it is a cop story about a Scooby gumshoe who solves a mysterious murder case.  On a deeper level, it is a psychological callback to the era's \\"unprecedented stressfulness of life\\" and \\"dream of prerevolution,\\" a tale of an America disillusioned with \\"parables of consumer capitalism\\" in a \\"faithless, money-driven world\\" and the wayward politics of the Nixon regime.       Its hero, Larry (Doc) Sportello, isa feckless, Los Angeles-based private eye persuaded by his ex-girlfriend Shasta Fay to look into a case involving her boyfriend, the real estate mogul Mickey Wolfmann.  But just as this is no conventional detective thriller, Doc Sportello is no conventional private eye either.  Doc lives in a funky little town called Gordita Beach, a backwater oceanside haven for bums and easy-go-lucky chums oblivious to the tides of law and mainstream culture.  He is a vertically challenged and oddly charming dude who makes \\"up for in at-titude\\" what he lacks \\"in al-titude,\\" the kind of gent who flirts with karmic laws instead of forensic syllogisms. Like most of Pynchon's heroes, Doc suffers from a hysterical brand of paranoia, although this time fueled more by smoking weed rather than the foreboding of a seedy political deed.     Shasta and Mickey go missing, and thus what begins as a harmless inquest leads Doc into a number of past cases that veer into a \\"bizarre tangle of motives and passions whose cast of characters includes surfers, hustlers, dopers and rockers, a murderous loan shark, a tenor sax player working undercover, an ex-con with a swastika tattoo and a fondness for Ethel Merman, and a mysterious entity known as the Golden Fang, which may only be a tax dodge set up by some dentists.\\"  The Golden Fang too may be a Vietnamese drug cartel or some shady holding company involving Mickey Wolfmann, but the list doesn't end there.      Among the zany outcries and licentious romps of antiwar and anti-racism activists, capitalist dissenters, potheads, bombers, satyrs, nymphomaniacs, and political pinkos, Pynchon also manages to insert marijuana-tinged philosophical jabber about a Pacific Atlantis called Lemuria and hazy talks about \\"other dimensions.\\"  Doc must also contend with his nemesis Detective Lt. Bigfoot Bjornsen, a snoopy head honcho of the corrupt cop kingdom of L.A.     Pynchon's writing in this low calorie page-turner retains many of the author's hallmarks: an extensive grocery list of stock characters with funny names, a stylistic decadence that takes the prosaic form to the hilt, a paranoiac streak that is as eccentric as it is humorous, and a profusion of cultural minutiae specific to the period.  The prose, however, is less self-indulgent and manages to be uncharacteristically compact.  Similarly, the musical and artistic nitty gritty plastered all over are fun and easily accessible inside jokes to the sixties savvy reader rather than cryptic allusions that require the help of an encyclopedia.  Would anyone care to look up some background information on the Japanese monster flick Ghidrah, or Henry Kissinger's stint on the Today Show, or period euphemisms for cocaine and heroin?      Unlike the cosmopolitan vein that runs about novels like V, Gravity's Rainbow, and Against the Day, the premise of Inherent Vice is rooted to the period trappings of the West Coast four decades removed. This is a novel about California and Las Vegas and the New Age communes, rock `n' roll concerts, clubs, druggies, dopers, hippies, and drifters that permeated an easy and laid-back region before it metamorphosed into the star-struck glam theme park of Hollywood actors, multimillion dollar homes, cosmetic surgery joints, and cinematic multiplexesThis is a novel about the vagaries and cultural schisms of the era.  This is a novel about America.    Considering the canon that precedes it, Inherent Vice admittedly reads like a watered down development on the author's bibliography.  To neophytes normally daunted by Pynchon's oeuvre, however, this book may very well be the most accessible introduction to his very complex fiction.  While the novel is decidedly underwhelming in addressing the staple Pynchonian dichotomies between order versus chaos and the individual versus the regime, it provides nonetheless a powerful vision encapsulated in the author's ability to envision a society fraught with problems perpetually immediate and relevant.  At the novel's close, Doc Sportello appears to portend the end of an era where a cold and impersonal unknown impinges on a life ruled formerly by freedom, individuality, and privacy.   Doing away with hordes of stoned hippies and the decade's collection of groovy and gnarly paraphernalia, is it possible that the sixties zeitgeist is coming back to haunt us?
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Bagdad Cafe is one of the best movies around!  Marianne Saegebrecht is delightful in her role and so is CC Pounder.  The movie takes off right from the beginning and never stops.  There are a lot of laughs, chuckles, snickers, and just plain broad smiles.  The music, of course, is quite haunting.  Saegebrecht is quite a popular character actress in Germany and it is good to see that she is getting out to a broader audience.
0307454541|5.0|The book is quite a page-turner.  It was long - without doubt - but I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I read a lot of stuff and I can sniff out a fake easily.  This is a genuine mystery with lots of twists and turns.  I didn't feel let down anytime - all the loose ends were tied up towards the end.  Must read for all mystery-thriller fans!
B001EYGOEM|4.0|Taylor Swift has some good and not so good things to say about love and relationships.  Good vocals and music. Easy to listen to........  To find an album with 80% of tracks that are pleasing is pretty damn good.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|I like everyone else was a fan of Whitney when she first came onto the music scene, but by the time \\"The Bodyguard\\" was released I had enough of her inflated ego.  Granted I still purchased her albums because she did have a lovely voice, but by the time her last studio album and Christmas albums came and went so did I.  I purchased this new album expecting something special which it isn't.  With the exception of the title track and her duet with Akon, \\"Like I Never Left\\" and the Diane Warren penned \\"I Didn't know My Own Strength\\", everything else is pretty standard filler.  Her voice, which is no help at all,  just makes the bad songs sound worse.  Drugs are a tragedy, I should know, my baby brother was addicted to cocaine and his life was very sad.  I am glad Whitney is back and I hope she remains sober but for all those people that are looking for the old Whitney she is gone.  Take this album for what it is and hope her next musical endeavor will be stronger.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|This book doesn't sacrifice scientific rigor or depth to gain in audience range and this is the reason why it is a little harder to read than the usual popular science book. The effort is definitely worthy. The travel through human origins using anatomy, paleontology and history of science is incredibly amazing and fun. The sense of humor and the richness of the methaphors are refreshing and help to understand things even whithout a scientific background like it's my case.  This book has been a lot of fun. It reminds me a book called Code: The hidden language of computer hardware and software. Both use the same method of going to the origins and understanding the evolution to the current complexity as effective way to understand two different complex systems: humans in this book and computers in the other.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|There is no doubt the Heavy Metal genre lives on with newbies Five Finger Death Punch. For a freshman effort, the the songs are amazingly tight and complex. I guess that should come as no surprise since members can list Motograter, WASP and U.P.O among other bands on their resumes. These guys can play and Ivan Moody can sing, not just scream, when he wants to. Doubt it? Check out their acoustic version of The Bleeding or their acoustic cover of Bad Company's eponymous song on YouTube. For my money, the three bonus tracks on this album are the best. \\"Never Enough\\", \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" and the acoustic version of \\"The Bleeding\\" are the best songs on the album. Moody writes powerful songs and can emote that in his singing. For those of you who need for your music to be dark and angry to be cathartic and help work out some aggression, this is for you. I can't help comparing Moody to Phil Anselmo on \\"Cemetary Gates\\". The complex song structures, the rift changes, the double kick drum and the bass/drum interplay leaves no doubt this is a metal band. I think \\"Ashes\\", \\"The Devil's Own\\", and \\"Meet The Monster\\" are also standouts. The next effort from these guys is out on Sept. 22, 2009 and I cannot wait to hear it. If these guys progress and mature the way other loud, aggressive bands such as Slipknot and Mudvayne have then I expect their second album to very good indeed. I like the first album from FFDP much more than I do the early stuff from either Slipknot or Mudvayne, but there is no doubt now that the lead singers from both those bands can also sing and not just scream when they want to as evidenced by their work with Stone Sour and Hellyeah, respectively.
0452289963|5.0|Excellent book. Also read Power of Now from him too . Buy it you life will change forever. Both Title also avalible in spanish for latin people.
B000V86OKG|5.0|The second season is better than the first.  The characters are coming into their own more, action and events are more seamless, less forced.  The characters seem to have developed more depth and beleivability, playing second fiddle to the story rather than distracting from it, as I sometimes found the case to be in the first season. Michael C Hall's acting is excellent, perhaps due to the twists and turns that the story is taking.  He has become his character much more deeply - as have most of the other characters.  Hall's work though is particularly mesmerizing.  There are also a number of important new characters this season which help shape the ever tense events that go down helping raise my impression of \\"Dexter\\" on the whole from solid 4 star material in the first season to genuine 5 star work in the second. Another reason this is a better season for me is that Sgt Doakes spends less time on screen and you have to suffer a lot less of his cheesy lines and character.  The first season keeps you interested, but beware getting into the second season if you have to work the next day - this is not an easy show to stop watching.
1594202249|4.0|It reminds me to some degree of Gravity's Rainbow, one of my absolute all time favourite books.  Have read it three times and also dip into it from time to time. It would be my first pick as a \\"desert island book\\".  Have read all of Pynchon's novels and some stories except that I have had difficulty sticking with his previous latest.<br /><br />Only half way through Inherent Vice but like the way it's developing.<br /><br />Very much enjoying the Los Angeles backdrop, to some of which places I've been.  Am actually following it on a very good scale street map.  I did the same with Gravity's Rainbow following Slothrop across Europe on the map, again some places to which I'd been.  I find it adds an extra dimension.
B002DKGWSE|5.0|Since this came out I had to buy this movie.I love how the parents took revenge on the murderers who raped and try to shoot her.If I was a parent I would do the same.This is from a making a point if you have children you try to protect them from harm.Would you go far to protect your children?That is the question from parents who have children.I loved the end of the movie it changed a little bit from the horror classic from the original.A five star movie.Thumbs up.
0452295548|5.0|I recently had a hemoragic stroke.  Fortunately it was not as massive as Jill Taylor's stroke.  She helped both me and those immediately around me to understand what happened to me which expedited my recovery. Her discussion of neuroplasicity and her recovery was a message of hope, encouragement and success.  See her at TED on YouTube at   [...]       ****HER APPENDIX B (\\"FORTY THINGS I NEEDED MOST\\") CONCISELY LISTS HOW PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED WHO HAVE STROKES. Although not all points were direcly applicable to me, she greatly helped me and other people better understand how poeple who have suffered brain injuries would like to be treated. This saved me a lot of time and reduced my frustration. (I was relieved that other people had the same feelings and she summarized them so succinctly.)  ***      Her book is invaluable and her sincerity about helping is illustrated by the very reasonable price of her book as contrasted to some who profess to help, but they price their products so high that access is limited.     P.S. kept short to emphasize insights and help offered by \\"My Stroke of Insight\\"
0446698342|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this wonderfully written story. I could not put this one down until I finished it. I fell in love with the characters as if I was watching a movie. It was a refreshing read and one that I will always remember. I'm off to the next Sparks book very soon.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|I have been scanning most of these reviews and have noticed many people were positive about this album but for reasons other than the actual music and instead trying to push an image of musical superiority. People saying \\"this is an acquired taste\\" are merely scaring away casual listeners from listening to this jewel of an album. I was also appalled to see a lot of 1-star reviews. The people who said this album was \\"pretentious crap\\" however are also seeing it for its image instead of the actual music. Now you may have noticed I gave this album a 4-star rating for the same complaints as everyone else, lengthy ambient noise. Pink Floyd did this as well but no one complained much because it was kept relatively short, however the infamous Cassandra Gemini track is mostly ambient noise. Unfortunately, most of the reviewers are complaining about one track on this great album. Cygnus, The Widow, and L'Via L'Viaquez are very good songs which explore Latin funk music. To summarize, don't ignore this album for one track while the rest is great. Have your own opinion and keep an open mind. Hipsters aren't the only people who listen to the Mars Volta, don't destroy this band because of an image which may or may not follow them; concentrate on the music.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Who would have thought Ben Affleck had talent?  As someone who is currently working a missing child case, I can tell you this is a most realistic movie. It stretches a bit with who ultimately did it (no spoilers) in the end, but the fuzzy line between right and wrong, what is good and evil, and what should be and what should not be done is done with finess and reality without any fancy action hero type silliness. The use of actual people from the street vs actors helped, and the real actors do a great job in keeping with character. Shows Missing Child stories aren't always so simple or so easy.   [...]

B00000K413|5.0|What so many are missing here is that TFF were formed on the basis of Primal Scream Therapy. This is not just a typical album to be reviewed without a background story and cute opinions about lyrics and music. Roland and Curt originally bonded over the commonality of difficult childhoods and the therapy that followed to assist in their healing. The music was their ultimate expression of their journey. They also had the talent and creativity to illustrate the emotions that accompanied their experiences. This isn't just a 'deep' and 'pretty' album. It is truly a masterpiece for those who understand what it really is and appreciate the music. For those who think that they need to explain every song of any album in these reviews, you need to save your interpretations for yourselves and allow each person to apply their own thoughts and ideas. Art is democratic.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Owen Wilson's friendly voice as race car \\"Lightning McQueen\\" is perfect for the Pixar movie about all kinds of cars.  The animation is outstanding as usual.  The mega-truckstop at the beginning of the movie showed a perfect example of the fantastic art and culture of the road.  \\"Cars\\" frames the 'road of life' and lessons old and young souls understand.  Kids will especially enjoy the racing and action scenes.<br /><br />Lightning is in a hurry to get to California for a big race and is traveling cross-country in a semi-truck. A series of accidents happen and Lightning McQueen ends up in a small desert town of Radiator Springs.  It is full of dying businesses because the traffic they depend on has been diverted to a new, faster Interstate.  When the old Route 66 went through, Desert Springs was doing well.  Lightning is arrested for tearing up the road and put in a \\"boot\\" and impounded.  The rusty old Tow Truck (Mato - short for To-Mato) is voiced over by Larry the Cable Guy.  Mato is friendly, dopey and kind to Lightning.  Lightning only wants to get back to his fast-paced world.<br /><br />The story is somewhat nostalgic for times that were not as pressured.  The reference to Route 66 following the bends and the lay of the land reminds us we need to take time to stop and smell the roses.  Now we have interstates cutting through in straight lines to save a few minutes here and there.  The story flows well and moves fast.  It is a thoughtful, creative movie and highly amusing.<br /><br />All the car characters are well developed and personalities match their make and models.  We have diversity and idiosyncrasy in the mix. There is the romance of the road as well as Lightning McQueen's romance with a sweet and racy Porsche lawyer (Bonnie Hunt).
B000I9YWDO|5.0|This movie is so funny and twisted. It's got humor, a caper, a romance, destruction of office equipment...what more could you ask for? If you've never seen it you should!
B002436WFI|5.0|I'm a very big fan of Terry Pratchett's written works, and I need to say that while this may not have been my mental image of the books while I was reading them, it certainly fits. For the most part. Yes, they did take out a lot which would have been difficult to film, but since the author himself did have a recurring part in the movie, I know that it was given his official seal of approval. And you can see that all the actors certainly had fun making this movie, despite its occasional cheesiness.    So while it might not have been a perfect adaptation, it certainly makes up for it with the sheer fandom enthusiasm which the actors put into the film.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Hail to the Theif was the first Radiohead album I'd heard that I didn't immediately fall in love with.  On both OK Computer and The Bends, and even Kid A and In Rainbows, right from the opening songs I loved the albums, with even the lesser songs getting at least 4 stars.  Not so with Hail to the Theif.  There are some good cuts, sure, but on the whole... not their best album.  I'd only recommend this for the most devoted fans and/or completists, and definitely not until you own their other albums.

B00005LB50|4.0|Well, as usual, I'm a day late and a dollar short (literally) when it comes to reviewing a music release that I should have purchased and reviewed the DAY it was released.  But never the less, here I am, reviewing the somewhat controversial Buffalo Springfield box set, all these years later!  I was introduced to this band at the age of four when I pulled out a copy of their debut album from out of my mother's record collection, took it to her and asked \\"Is this The Beatles?\\"  ANYWHO!  I got 1969's \\"Retrospective\\" on cassette when I was just ten years old and fell in love with every single song.  When I was in the fifth grade, Buffalo Springfield was probably my second favorite band, right after The Beatles.      So what's up with this box set?!?!  Is it good?  Is it bad?  It it the result of Neil Young's ego?  Do you care?  What do you make of what appears to be a confusing mess of tracks with no rhyme or reason?  Well, there is a rhyme and there is a reason and here's how a fan might want to approach it in order to enjoy this four disc collection. It's basically the STORY of The Buffalo Springfield.  Think of it as a an audio documentary, going through demos and finished songs as the story of the band unfolds track by track.  The first three discs combine demos and finished album cuts in order of how they were recorded, complete with recording dates listed in the accompanying booklet.  Disc One: 1966, Disc Two: 1966-1967, Disc Three: 1967-1968.  For disc four, we have the two studio albums in their entirety that the band consider their TRUE albums, \\"Buffalo Springfield\\" and \\"Buffalo Springfield Again.\\"  \\"Last Time Around\\" was issued by Atco in July of 1968 and was put together by the record company.  The band had already split up by the time of it's release so the tracks from \\"Last Time Around\\" are presented individually as tracks recorded from their last sessions, not as a complete album in the band's catalog.   Makes sense to me.  However three cuts are missing from \\"Last Time Around.\\"  Why?  I don't know but I could offer up a few theories.    Where is \\"In The Hour Of Not Quite Rain?\\"  Well, it's my guess that there may have been copyright issues with this particular track.  A one Micki Callen of Reseda, CA wrote the song's lyrics (credited to Callen/Furray), as the winner of KHJ's Radio \\"Words\\" Contest.  He (she?) won $1,000 plus publishing royalties for the song so there may be red tape involved.  The track was included on 1973's anthology album, but that was 1973 and not 2001.  You know how it is nowadays.  As for \\"Carefree Country Day,\\" COM'ON!  It may be just my personal opinion but I'd like to know how many people really, really like this song.  I find it a bit lame myself.  It would have been a nice song for Loggins and Messina or possibly a Country Time Lemonade commercial (seriously, who didn't think of that).  I think the previously unreleased track from Ritchie Furray, \\"Whatever Happened To Saturday Night?\\" would have made a much better contender for the album.      What about the album version of \\"On The Way Home?\\"  Well, in Neil's eyes, this \\"original\\" version was probably more appropriate for the box set.  I'm missing the punch of that horn section though!  Mind you this is the ONLY track from the band's end stage that features all five original members playing on it and listen to how great it is!  Makes you wish the Springfield could have just got their crap together and continued on as a recording/performing band!  Since the horns were added after the fact, Neil most likely wanted to keep it real for this set.  Still missing those horns though.  If the Springfield HAD pulled together for one last record, no doubt it would've been a killer.

B000Y7U98C|5.0|This movie is one of my top favorite movies of all time. It has a riveting story that is highly believable and grasps you in from the moment you start the movie. The acting is excellent, and it all around is an excellent movie.<br /><br />I have to say I am very pleased with how fast I got this movie from when I ordered and to the fact that it came in exactly the box shown, and in perfect condition. I recommend buying this movie, it is a great deal, great shipping, and a fantastic movie.

I kept reading this book because I wanted to learn what happened to the main characters - and because I paid for the Tawny trilogy. I am on book 2 of this series and it too is moving slowly.

B00150B2SS|5.0|\\"A modern masterpiece\\" says the blurb, and I couldn't agree more. Brilliantly written, plotted and imagined, LeCarre novels deftly describe a modern world in which reality, idealogy, and morality are all relative - and yet, encouragingly, good men still manage to find paths through the morass.    In this and many of his other works, LeCarre does an amazing job of depicting espionage as a shadowy parallel universe in which everything familiar is unsettlingly unfamiliar, from the language the intelligence community invents for itself, to the precarious lives his characters live, to the disconcerting way in which the ordinary detritus of human life - newspapers, milk bottles, church pews - comes to be imbued with chilling significance.    George Smiley, the reluctant hero of this tale, is a reimagined version of the chivalric English hero, blending personal courage and dedication to duty with all-too-human vulnerability.    There are simply too many books in the world worth reading to devote much time to reading books over again. However, this is one book I find myself revisiting again and again - maybe because every one in a while, I like to believe (if only for 300 pages) that, despite all the ambiguity of our \\"modern\\" world, people who believe in duty and honor still exist.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is awesome. The workouts are challenging, but doable. Jillian does not go easy on people. She's dedicated to getting people in shape, and it shows. She makes people work for it! I love this workout. I look and feel better and stronger, thanks to this video (and my own hard work, haha!). It's also a lot of fun. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to push themselves and get in shape. Try it and find out that you're stronger than you thought!
0307386171|3.0|Loved the lyrical prose, loved the descriptive artistry ... but couldn't bring myself to love this overblown short-story-masquerading-as-novel of two lovers who never do manage to figure out that love requires self-knowledge, compassion and communication to endure. (Though I will admit there's good discussion to be had over the extent to which self-knowledge, compassion and communication between men and women was possible in 1960s England - and my book group did indeed enjoy a lively discussion on this subject!)     I think the reader is supposed to feel the tragedy and pathos of their self-selected blindness, but mostly I just felt manipulated by the author, whose depiction of \\"love\\" in this novel seems unconvincingly pale and feeble. Can't help believing two people really in love would never have given up so easily, and would have found a way to see!
0060254920|4.0|I read \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" to my first child, a calm, obedient, and quiet child because it was supposed to be a classic. While we both enjoyed the brilliant illustrations and the storyline, I must admit that I -- also having been a calm, obedient child -- just didn't get it. Then I had my second child, a little girl who is a \\"wild thing.\\"    Over-active children will probably relate to this story more. My little girl is intelligent, imaginative, rarely obedient and brings melodrama to the entire family, just like Max in the book. I began to see the book in a different light. It's the story of a boy who is lonely and angry, and the only way he can appropriately channel his anger is through imagination. The Wild Things are symbols of his wild emotions, which Max tames \\"with the magic trick of staring into their yellow eyes without blinking once,\\" and he's made king of all wild things. After rollicking wildly in the forest, Max conquers his anger and becomes lonely, only wanting to go back where \\"someone loved him best of all.\\"    Children who experience these strong - albeit brief - emotions often have difficulty understanding them at first and learn to conquer them to \\"re-enter\\" the adult world where they must behave. If you have a child like this, you'll appreciate Sendak's ability to illustrate the imagination and feelings of a child who does not yet have the maturity to express emotions verbally.    I can't wait for the movie release!
B000R8YC1S|5.0|If you enjoyed this movie as a teen or young adult, you'll fall in love with it all over again.  I already owned the VHS & soundtrack but am SO GLAD that I got this Anniversary set on DVD as well.  The picture quality is superb & the talent eternal.  Don't miss the commentary version w/ Brian Froud.  Unlike most that are done when the DVD is first released, this one was done some 20 years later, after the film had already become a well-established classic.  Froud lends a lot of depth to the movie with contemporary perspectives & references to modern day animation & special effects & insight to many of the story/set/costume/specFX details that you would otherwise miss!  The 1st bonus feature on Disc 2 is a trip back to the 70's, the original behind-the-scenes documentary.  The 2nd & 3rd are wonderfully done!  Interviews with George Lucas, Brian Froud, David Bowie, Brian Henson & others as they remember what it was like to work on such a ground-breaking project.  Without being overt about it, it's also a wonderful tribute to Jim Henson.
0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games was just the beginning of this Phenomenal trilogy. The first book was a thrilling, adrenaline pumping, heart-pounding novel. I read it in just  two days. The Hunger Games is about a futuristic country called Panem, where there is a beautiful Capital and twelve outlining districts. The Capital is cruel and they force each district to send two children, one boy and one girl, between the ages of twelve and eighteen to the Capital to fight in the annual Hunger Games. Of the twenty-four tributes only one can survive. The main characters in this series are Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the two tributes from the impoverished Disrict 12. They are both allowed to win the 74th annual Hunger Games by deceiving the Capital with their fake love for each other.<br /><br /> Catching Fire is about the outcome of them winning the Games. It starts off with them having to go on the cruel Victory Tour, they have to travel to each of the twelve districts, who are forced to celebrate them winning the Games even though Katniss and Peeta may have personally killed that district's tributes. The President of Panem, Snow, knows that Katniss and Peeta have deceived him and his people, and he wants revenge. You may be shocked at what he has in mind.<br /><br /> Catching Fire is just as action-packed and heart-poundingg as the first. The book has surprises at almost every turn. If you thought the first book had a cliffhanger ending, you will certainly be left open mouthed and cursing for book 3 at the end of this one.
B00260HH3K|3.0|Fans of the anime (cartoon) series DRAGONBALL are legion. They collect everything from gaming cards to actual balls created to go with the show. Some go so far as to make costumes like their favorite characters. So, with Hollywood's reputation for taking source material and screwing it up to make it their own it's no surprise that fans weren't not enthused about the making of let alone the release of DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION.<br /><br />For those fans my guess is they didn't like the final product. The film opened to mild interest and even lower box office returns. And having watched only 2 or 3 episodes with my son when he was little, I can see why they weren't leaping over one another to purchase tickets. The story has changed and that is something die hard fans can rarely if ever accept. So what's the movie itself like? Not bad if you toss aside the history of Dragonball and look at it on its own. Not great, but not bad.<br /><br />Goku (Justin Chatwin) is being raised by his grandfather. At home they study an ancient form of martial arts that is beyond most others. All the same, Goku's grandfather has demanded of him that he never display his abilities or get into a fight. The problem is grandpa isn't in high school and picked on by the jerks there.<br /><br />Goku is though and when he comes face to face with them he does all in his power to avoid confrontation. Not easy when he acts clumsily in front of the hot popular girl Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) who also happens to be dating one of the jocks. Fortunate enough for Goku, Jamie takes notice of him anyway.<br /><br />During his training, Goku is told of the Dragonballs, the seven mystical orbs that when united will give the evil Piccolo the ability to take over the world. Entrusted to grandpa and then to Goku is one of the seven orbs. Unfortunately the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) has already collected several of the Dragonballs and on his way for this one.<br /><br />Goku goes to a party hosted by Chi Chi only to be confronted by the bullies. While his anger rages, he does stay true to his promise of not fighting by avoiding any and all attempts to squash him by the bullies. Instead he allows them to use their own force against them. Not only does he beat them up without hitting them, he makes a good impression on Chi Chi as well. But just as things between the two start to gel, Goku realizes that something is happening at home and has to leave.<br /><br />When he gets there, he finds the house in ruins, smashed to pieces and his grandfather lying beneath it all. He helps him out and talks to him, learning of the attack by Piccolo's followers who are trying to gather the Dragonballs. Goku has the one, now he must find those that remain and defend them from Lord Piccolo. And to do so he must enlist the help of Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) to complete his training.<br /><br />Along the way Goku gets the help of several partners all seeking their own fame and fortune including another Dragonball owner and a fortune hunter. As they search they also find Chi Chi at a martial arts competition as well as numerous bad guys in the employ of Lord Piccolo.<br /><br />As one could predict from the beginning of this film, the eventual combination of all seven Dragonballs will happen and Lord Piccolo will get involved in a final showdown with either Goku or Master Roshi. And while Roshi may seem a bumbling inebriated fool, never underestimate your opponent or his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.<br /><br />The film offers some decent martial arts sequences though when placed up against the natural or high wire scenes from far too many Chinese imports they seem rather slow and thought out. As a fan of the genre, that's the first thing you notice. If you've not seen many of these (or any Bruce Lee film) then the film comes off as a fast paced fight film. The average moviegoer will be impressed.<br /><br />The story is based on one of the many chapters of the legendary anime series and moves along at breakneck speed. One minute we're training with grandfather the next we're on the road saving the world. The fact that it's based on this anime series makes that more believable. But the world of Dragonball is not one of reality but one of fantasy and in that realm this movie delivers.<br /><br />As I said at the outset, fans of fictional characters and worlds are hard pressed to find the results delivered from Hollywood to suit their expectations. Even when they deliver the goods aren't always what those fans wanted. For every LORD OF THE RINGS there is a DUNE. Fans have so much invested in these worlds that what they get never meets their expectations.<br /><br />If you go into this movie expecting that world you will be disappointed. If you go in looking for a decent action film that matches many tossed out by Hollywood, you'll walk away entertained. The low box office receipts say that there won't be a sequel. But that won't prevent those who take this movie on its own merits from having an enjoyable night at the movies.ing the world.

B00288KNLS|3.0|this movie made me ask myself the question,\\"do i want to continue to keep watching movies considering how evil they've become\\"? the movie is about a little girl who is ignored by her horrible parents and retreats into a secret path to another better world.then she is threatened with abuse,trapped,forced to see her friend after he has been abused .this is nothing that should be in a cartoon.much less,not advertised as for adults only.the girl is locked in a closet and meets 3 other dead children who died there.this is seriously messed up!i also noticed during the credits and junk that no one mentioned the people at dc comics who coralines evil mom is based on.captain hellfire or something like that.i love comic books but MAN do they have to be so evil?\\"watchmen\\" was the epitome of evil comic book movies.i even hear rob zombie has made one.im just not sure why a so called little kids movie is so horrifying.i cant belive society is so lax on evil now that they would allow this to go on.i just cant seem to find new movies these days that dont remind me how F'd up life really is and how far we have all strayed from the right path.i think if you let your children watch this ,you are a bad parent.
B002CAWNEM|3.0|Obsession is used in so many things these days, from describing how people relate to politics to perfume. Now the name has been taken and used for a feature film that offers little new but delivers the goods for fans of the genre.<br /><br />That genre is the cheated on spouse whose rival goes crazy and attempts to take over. Perhaps the biggest known film in this genre was FATAL ATTRACTION. After that film came out, it's hard to believe anyone would be stupid enough to cheat on their spouse. And yet they continue to do so. If not we wouldn't have films like OBSESSED.<br /><br />Derek Charles (Idris Elba) is an asset manager with a major firm. He's just about to land the biggest contract of his career, things are going well with his wife Sharon (Beyonce Knowles) and they've recently had a child. Life couldn't be better.<br /><br />Then one day a secretary takes ill and Derek finds a temp in the office by the name of Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter). They first meet accidentally in the elevator but not long after he finds Lisa working as a temp for his ill assistant. While she seems efficient, she has a certain air of familiarity about her that bothers Derek.<br /><br />No doubt this comes from a past of flirting in the office, a past that resulted in his marrying Sharon. And the two of them made a pact of no female secretaries. When Sharon discovers the young woman working there, she gets angry (since he told her she was plain looking) and suggests he find a replacement. This happens soon enough when his assistant comes back. But then Lisa snags a job replacing another ill secretary.<br /><br />At the office Christmas party, Lisa makes her play for Derek by trying to catch him under the mistletoe. This lame ploy is brushed off but not before she follows him into the men's room and plants a big old wet one on him. Not one to fall back on his old ways, Derek rebuffs her attempt but she doesn't let go. Then again, he fails to mention the problem to Sharon.<br /><br />Instead not long after, Derek finds himself about to head home in the parking garage when Lisa jumps into his car wearing a trench coat. And underneath? A revealing teddy. Derek insists she get out of the car but Lisa is convinced that he truly loves her. While he continues to tell her to get out, she argues until he finally gets her to leave. Swearing to tell Sharon when he gets home, he puts it off when he finds her crying about her sister whose husband has just had an affair.<br /><br />Push comes to shove and Lisa attempts suicide blaming Derek for the whole thing. The police now begin to investigate Derek even though he denies everything. Lisa has planned this well and the evidence all points to the two of them having had an affair. He denies, she confirms. And Sharon, fearful of his previous indiscretions prior to their marriage, believes Lisa and kicks Derek out.<br /><br />Eventually the proof comes out of Derek's innocence. Months go by and Sharon forgives him, even though he did nothing wrong with the exception of not telling her immediately. Lisa has returned to the care of her sister after the initial hospital stay. But she's out again and about to make one last attempt to regain the man she is certain loves her. While that may be her desire, it isn't one Sharon is bound to take lightly and the battle is on.<br /><br />It would be easy to say that this film is predictable, because honestly it is. But there are some films that come along that are predictable and that's okay. It forms a sort of shorthand for the viewer and fulfills the need for this sort of trashy romance type film.<br /><br />While it does fill that need, it left me feeling like it was more routine than anything. I found it hard to believe that someone who has worked so hard to get where he is could act so stupidly and not notice what is right before his eyes. The character of Sharon was such a shrew at times I had a hard time sympathizing. She was so determined to believe Derek could do wrong that she never gave him a chance to speak let alone defend himself. For two people so in love one would think at least she would give him the chance.<br /><br />The actors perform well in this outing, doing what a good actor does. They make you lose the idea that this is an actor and instead believe them in their roles. Especially well done is the performance by Larter which could have found its way into clich&eacute;. Instead she comes off as truly scary while at the same time making you feel a touch of sympathy for her and her unstable condition. She only wants to be loved.<br /><br />While the performance delivers that, one has to also suspend belief to the extreme to believe that someone as attractive as Larter wouldn't be able to find someone who cared for her. Even a shallow relationship would have been enough for the character of Lisa to jump at. Then again, I guess one could always fall back on the idea that \\"it's only a movie\\".<br /><br />So does it entertain? Does it make for a good viewing? Sure, especially if you like this genre. For a night's rental you could do worse. As for a vehicle that will drive the career forward of Beyonce? I don't think this one will do it. She seems truly capable in her role here.

0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games series is branded for a y/a audience, but anyone, at any age, can enjoy this story. The second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire, did not disappoint.  I started reading on Friday night at 11:30 pm telling myself that I would read only one chapter, but of course, like the Hunger Games, it was just too hard to put down.  I ended up reading about six or seven chapters and it was close to 2:30 am before going to bed.  I finished the book the next day, reading straight to the end.  I think I loved this book and was not disappointed because I only let myself guess at a rough outline of what would take place, not try to write Collins' book myself. If you enjoyed the Hunger Games, go into Catching Fire with an open mind that wherever Collins takes you, she has a reason for it. Like the Hunger Games, Catching Fire has stayed with me, even after finishing it, and I can't wait to have time to start reading it over, again.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|Director David Fincher tries desperately to make this plodding but beautifully photographed movie something magical, but the leaden, tin-eared script keeps the proceedings resolutely earthbound.  Really, young screenwriters should be assigned the not unenviable task of watching \\"Casablanca\\" each and every day until creating memorable dialogue and characters becomes second nature.  I have NO idea why this film was nominated for any Oscars other than the technical awards; it must have been the Fitzgerald story on which it was based.
0393312836|5.0|This is a very \\"fun\\" read. At first the language is a little daunting, but it quickly grows on you. The narration is very good and even the most vile of scenes are spoken like they are nothing special. Extremely entertaining: A+

Who wants to read and dedicate themselves to a book or in this case a series then not have a happy ending?? I dont!! I hate books like that! I told myself the whole time I was reading the whole series if she does not get edward and become a vampire I was going to raise h***! Well, luckly I did not have too. So what if the little girls name is different, SHE IS DIFFERENT!!!!! Who cares if bella gets everything she has every wanted, SHE DESERVES IT!!!! Those of you that wanted a horrible ending dont deserve to call yourselves a TWLIGHT FAN!!!
B0009UC810|5.0|I continue to be baffled at people who would say they \\"love\\" a movie but rate it only 1 star because they don't like the packaging, or the freebie extras aren't what they were expecting or that it has some coarse language (it IS an R-rated film, don't they understand that when they buy it?)<br /><br />Even more bewildering is rating a movie 1 star because it wouldn't play in the 29 dollar DVD player they bought at WallyMart!<br /><br />This review will cover two things ... the movie and the technical quality of the disc.<br /><br />It is not easy to watch a movie that's almost 30 years old that doesn't look horribly \\"dated\\" unless it is a period piece like Sound of Music or Cleopatra.  It takes a lot of talent to make a movie that can stay fresh 30 years later and that is what this movie is full of.  Amazing talent.  The casting is flawless, every character fits and is captured at the height of their brilliance.  The setting, the scenery, the editing, the lighting, the sound ... all flawless.  The plot is simple but even if you have seen it before, it is immensely entertaining.  It is refreshing that this movie was never overhyped yet earned a spot as a true classic all by itself.  I am happy I bought a copy rather than rent it, especially since Amazon sold it for under eight bucks.<br /><br />I have asked myself if Blu-ray is worth anything to me.  Once again I have watched a DVD movie that makes me doubt that it is.  The video quality and sound quality were both perfect, especially for a 30 year old movie.  Blu-ray might have a slight advantage but this copy of The Blues Brothers comes close to the maximum my HDTV can display.<br /><br />For those of you who have never seen The Blues Brothers, I hope you are not influenced by the few<br />1 star \\"reviews\\".  Read them and you'll see that they don't actually review the movie, only the complaints some people have about the studio or their own technical problems.  This is a movie that deserves a viewing.  You may end up hating it, it is anything but mainstream, but at least you'll have made your decision on your own., but at least you'll have made your decision on your own.

144861919X|5.0|I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did.  I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters.  I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.<br /><br />All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with.  You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are.  If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.<br /><br />Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!
0385340575|1.0|Like others, I've enjoyed many of the Jack Reacher series, so I was surprised to encounter a plot so thin and so implausible.  Do I believe that high national stakes depend or that top gun special service groups would be deployed all just to suppress a picture showing Bin Laden together with an American politician?  Not on your life.  It put me in mind of a song sung by several African tribes in prison in the superb novel \\"The Power of One\\".  The words to the song are meant to describe the actions of the prison guards: \\"They go here, they go there.  They are confused.\\"  Words that perfectly describe the actions of Reacher and the other characters.  The action scenes were great as usual.  Child's knowledge and descriptions of weaponry were encyclopedic.  But if you don't care about the characters, it's hard to feel emotionally attached to their weapons.  Dogged reader that I am, I finished the book.  No small trouble.  But I think I'll give Reacher and Child a rest for a while.  Maybe a long while.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|This is my current favorite album.  The funky blues and soul stew that is the Derek Trucks Band is in top form here.  Great musicians all, but Trucks is a genius.  His lack of physical expression is more than made up by his almost infinite expression with the guitar.  Beyond his technical excellence, his solos are pure emotion.  This is not only great music, but a musical companion to feed your soul.
038073186X|3.0|Big fan of Dennis Lehane, and I appreciate where he went with this story. It does a nice job of capturing the uncertainty and fear of cold war 1950's. The setting is intriguing too.<br /> I can not share the enthusiasm of other reviewers for this, especially those who have not read Lehane's other work. I felt the characters are sacrificed for the sake of the plot and the attempt to take the reader on a psychic thrill-ride. I like thrill-rides as much as the next guy, but this one was not worthy of all the rave reviews. The characters are all presented to us only in the context of the main character's madness and delusion. This is the type of story where the character could sit up at the end and realize it all was just a dream. In fact it may have been...we can not be sure from our perspective.<br />  Some of you obviously enjoy that, but I feel it is a bit of a cop-out by the author. I finished it with a sense of emptiness, It was a nice story but I think it could have been much better.<br />  Ironically, I think this will make a great movie, though. Seeing it unfold on the screen will be a much better take than the novel's perspective.
B001CQONKY|5.0|I am VERY pleased with these DVDs and with CSI Season 8... can't wait to get Season 9! Transaction with this seller was stellar! AAAAAA+++++++ I'd buy from this seller again, in a heartbeat!    Thanks, Gracie
B002HHPVHQ|5.0|This book is terrifically riveting from cover to cover. I happen to love the concept of humanity, which seems abysmally lacking from the world of high finance and our leaders that be (eg., Dick Fuld & company, politicians on the take), so I especially prefer the autobiographical approach, unlike the many who have given it a one star. Certainly this is not THE book that addresses THE firm that brought Earth to its knees in a matter of hours (that book may never be written by an individual, but by the course of history itself still unfolding). I think it would be a matter of great hubris if either author intended that, but hubris seems to have been at epidemic proportions in that broader community before the collapse. Still, who am I to judge? After certain scenes were written about, like the Delta Airlines bust, I realized I had never met anyone who would deliberately put themselves through such events, no matter how much money they were paid (that statement is not an argument for huge bonuses, by the way). Like firefighters who save lives on the homefront, or soldiers who go to war, etc. (and do NOT get huge bonuses), present-day Earth needs folks like that -- folks who would choose to do what most of us would never choose to do in a trillion years. Yet how does one build an ethical and moral dynamic into this subculture? In short, how do folks not forfeit their humanity in the midst of high finance? To my mind, this question is key. Trust should come with the territory. We've learned it doesn't. If it doesn't come with the territory? \\"Ya got trouble right here in River City.\\" No system can ever be all about greed and survive itself. Charles Green wrote Jan 20, 2007, in \\"Trust, Democracy, and Capitalism\\": \\"The system of capitalism is wide open. If you have an idea, you can turn it into capital. But... in capitalism, the most fundamental building block is trust. When I see what the top dogs at all too many corporations are now doing to that trust, I feel queasy. Outrageous -- yes, obscene -- pay. Greedy backdating of stock options, which in my opinion is straight-up theft. Managers buying assets from their trustors, the stockholders, at pennies on the dollar, then forestalling competing bids with lockups and insane breakup fees. These misdeeds and many, many more are hammer blows at the granite foundation of trust we built in the 1940s and '50s. How long democratic capitalism can survive these blows before it gives in and gives birth to revolution or to an out-and-out aristocracy, I am not sure.\\" (& it ain't over until the fat lady sings anyway. Which will it be? Revolution? Or out-and-out aristocracy?). I read Mr. Green's words now and weep for Americans (and did the same as I read The Colossal Failure of Common Sense, but for obviously different reasons). Before reading The Colossal Failure, my tendency was to demonize all investment bankers. Yet be aware that the writers, justifiably or not, demonized Dick Fuld.     In my mind, kudos really go to Patrick Robinson, who beautifully related the inner thoughts and feelings of another's experiences, Lawrence Mcdonald. I hope Mr. Robinson gets to co-author many more books in this vein. For example, the same horrific experience from the mind of people like Stan O'Neill, Dick Fuld, and some of the particularly excoriated others. I'm still in shock, which is why I'm still reading about the financial collapse. I still don't understand how bright Americans could have allowed this to have happened. This BS that it couldn't be foreseen (\\"Who knew?\\" -- Plenty of folks, and they got laughed or drummed out of the room) is what it is -- BS. And my ultimate take thus far is -- those folks live on Pluto, and they need to live on planet Earth for a time, like in some of the newly developed homeless communities that their structured perverse incentives created. But thank you, Mr. Mcdonald. Earth was not so remotely held in your mind, and you appear to have a heart. I learned a great deal all around; the book stimulated me to think a little in the midst of perpetually crying, made necessary since I apparently feel far too much than present day America allows. This book should be required reading for all Americans who can stomach -- thus far -- what has happened. Especially by politicians about to craft new legislation. BTW, I do believe we need more folks like Hank Paulson, who can do an about face in his particular philosophy in a flash to do what he can to salvage all that remains. And the truth tellers mentioned in this book, who did what they could to pound some common sense into the juggernaut of absolute power, absolute greed. Bottom line: Greed is NOT good. Long overdue time to figure out what is.
B0001US8EO|4.0|GREAT seller... I'd buy again from this seller in a heartbeat. DVD was entertaining and loved Kevin Costner's performance and Dennis Quaid's performance as Doc Holiday was outstanding! I'd recommend this DVD!    Thanks, Gracie

B0013FXWU6|3.0|My husband made me watch this, it was ok, long, but ok. The entire movie I kept thinking Daniel Day Lewis was channeling Sam Elliot (Mask with Cher) and Tom Selleck, and he sounded like Sean Connery..like he has rocks in his mouth..really took away from the movie, trying to understand what he was saying and what accent he was trying to imitate.

0375842209|5.0|I was very excited to read this book after all the reviews I read. I had trouble getting into the first maybe quarter of the book. I think maybe I was just in the wrong environment for reading. As the chapters go by though, it gets better. The last half of the book is just incredible. I've been reading thrillers as of lately and I love the page-turning books. This is one of them, but in somewhat of a different way. Just read it!
074356619X|5.0|I have ordered and enjoyed this CD set.  When I completed the 3rd CD, I put the 4th CD in to listen to.  To my surprise, the CD is ruined and all garbled.  So, after contacting Amazon by e-mail with no reply, I sit here dissappointed that the 4th CD completes the purpose of the set and my life and I are uncompleted.  Could I please have just the 4th CD?  The other 3 are fine.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface is probably my favorite movie.  It's very rare that I ever end up liking the bad guy of a movie, but this was one of those rare occasions.  But Tony wasn't really a bad guy, was he?  He was dirt poor and did what he felt he had to do to enjoy life.  Following the rules meant he would work as a dish washer.  Breaking the rules meant he would have more cash than he could possibly spend.    But here's what I liked about Tony.  Even though he was a thug, and he definitely was, he had a soft side.  He was saddened by the fact that he couldn't have kids.  He wasn't a womanizer.  When an associate of his asks Tony to carry out a hit, in exchange for getting him out of trouble, Tony refuses.  He refuses because carrying out this hit meant innocent children would be killed.  Tony is many things, but he won't be responsible for the death of innocent children.  Instead, he shoots his associate before the hit was carried out.  Tony wanted to make peace with his mother and take care of her and his sister (since his father ran out on them when they were kids).  She refused because she knew what he was.  I don't feel sorry for Tony, but I did find him to be a likable person.  If he could have made lots of money legitimately, he would have done so.  Aside from that, aren't his oppressors criminals too?  No, because his oppressors are the ones who get to make up the rules!  By what authority?  By the authority granted to them by the fact that they have bigger guns.    Scarface is extremely violent and has more curse words than any other movie I can think of.  However, it's a great movie and a great story.  Tony gets what's coming to him in the end.  He chose to live by the sword and so he died by the sword.  But in the end, I can't help but ask myself who the real bad guys are.  Don't get me wrong, he was a bad guy and deserved what he got.  But was he the only real bad guy in this story?  He was only in business because there were cops out there accepting bribes.  It's asthey say, \\"don't hate the player, hate the game.\\"  If Scarface were a real person, I would have no sympathy for him.  But since this is only a movie, I guess it sort of justifies it...at least in my mind.

B00005JO20|5.0|The story of King Kong is awesome.  As a fan of cryptozoology, I ask myself, would I have preferred they leave Kong alone (aside from rescuing the lady, of course)?  Or would I prefer they bring him to America so that we can all behold him?    What happens when we discover Bigfoot or any other legendary animal?  We'll be happy for a while and excited, but it will eventually become boring without the mystery.  Then again, wouldn't we all want to know?  I always appreciate thought-provoking movies that make me ask myself such questions.    Skull Island was a place untouched by time and technology.  We didn't know anything about it and so we assumed it didn't exist.  Ah, but it did exist.  Are there any such places out there?  We assume not.  Otherwise, we would already know about it, right?  There is no doubt many places out there we know nothing about (though it's anyone's guess as to what types of animals are to be discovered in such places).    I liked the original very much, but I felt this remake was far better.  King Kong's size was consistent in this version.  Skull Island and its inhabitant were far creepier in this version as well.  And Jack Black, though I'm not a fan, was great in this movie.    I didn't care much for the long King Kong vs. Dinosaur fights.  But I still think this movie was great overall.
0307454541|5.0|Riveting. Totally mesmerizing. As the end nears of this long book, you wish it were longer. It is tragic that its author died at age 50 after only writing three in an intended series of ten books.
B0002YCVXI|2.0|I downloaded the whole Album in MP3 and found that the first two pieces are mixed and truncated improperly. As a matter of fact, the last 50 seconds of the first piece Gabriel's Oboe is actually the begining of the second piece The Falls. So The Fall has an abrupt start. In addition to these two pieces, #4, #9 and #15 also have sudden cut-offs in their endings. #18 and #19 are similar to #1 and #2. It seems to me they are divided into two pieces from a continues play. This is supposed to be a great album. But with so many defects in MP3, I don't think it is worth $9.99 to download. One thing I need to mention is Amazon customer service. Once I called them and described the problems, they immediately agreed to issue a full refund and claim that they will fixed the defects. By looking at the reviews, this issue has been there for a while. I hope it will be fixed soon.

B000002G7E|3.0|It's odd that the Velvets reject their debut album's feel in their second album, only for them to return to their origins with a vengeance in their self-titled album.  Of their first three albums, which is all that I've heard by them, it's this, their second album, which justifies this band as being labelled 'proto-punk' or 'experimental' etc, because albums either side of it are, for the most part, quite easy listening. Not sure how many people have noticed this, but the cover art for \\"White light/White heat\\" is remarkably similar to what Metallica would use for their self-titled album, which was itself all black. Co-incidence? Before I go into my thoughts on the songs on this album, I should say that I was tempted to give this album 7/10, but then I listened to their third album, and it being similar in style to their debut, I thought I'd better leave some clean air between my scores for those three albums. If you love their 1st and 3rd albums, I don't think you will find much to enjoy on this album. Alternatively, if have heard their debut album or their 3rd album, and you can't understand why this band has the alternative reputation that they have, then you owe it to yourself to listen to this album. It's the kind of album that you will either really like or really dislike. So, I'd give this album an scoring range between 5 and 7 out of 10. Let's call it 65/100. It's a pity Amazon don't give scores by halves...3.5 stars out of 5 seems fairer than it giving it 3 stars or 4 stars.       Best track:    White light/white heat - this song strikes me as the kind of song that you could have found on Bob Dylan's \\"Blonde on blonde\\" album. Lou Reed often strikes me as being a Bob Dylan pupil who could often outshine his master.  Track features a honky tonk piano and is catchy.  There is distortion in this song...it sounds sort of fluffy and muffled.  The band provide backing vocals on this. Outro is a bit experimental in vibe.    The gift - a bit like Dylan at hisworst...here we get a shaggy dog story, a la \\"Blood on the tracks\\", by someone putting on an educated, Indian type accent. The left channel is devoted to that voice and the right channel has the music...electric guitar, bass and drums.  It isn't quite as annoying as Dylan's shaggy dog stories on Blood, but it is so lucidly narrated and in such a matter-of-fact style that it doesn't really qualify as art, I don't think. Certainly there is no comparison with Malcolm McLarens lovely spoken word fairytale which introduces The Sex Pistols' album \\"The great rock'n'roll swindle\\", or, for that matter, the lovely Cream song called \\"Pressed rat and warthog\\", which because of their fairytale nature have enduring appeal. They never get old, I don't think. Unlike this song. Heard it once, heard it a thousand times. Some of the lyrics strike me as being saucy though. This is a track which could annoy some listeners, and maybe might have been better off placed last on the album.    Lady Godiva's operation - lyrically, this song strikes me as being proto-death metal! It's quite gruesome, in a graphic way, and there's nothing to distract the listener from the lyrics, unlike on their masterpiece from their third album, \\"Murder mystery\\", which is the band at their experimental height. This track is a slow tempo melodic song with an interesting drum pattern/tone.  Occasionally you get a child like vocal appearing, and you can hear a violin used as well.    Here she comes now - a genteel song, with melodic note picking on the guitar. Lyrics are quite repetitive. This track is part of this album's schizophrenic nature...mellow tracks like this, mixed with tracks that push the envelope a lot, like the song above.    I heard her call my name - this track sounds proto-punk to me.  Haven't really heard anything else which would deserve that label by this band, despite them being described as such in some circles.  In my notes I describe this track as a proto-punk spiritual song. Maybe it's the backing vocals which conjures the 'spiritual' adjective.  Other punkish elements to this track are the rhythm guitar and the lead guitar...generally there is a \\"have a go\\" feel to proceedings,  where 'having a go' is placed above sounding like a professional musician.  And that's part of the punk philosophy, right?  This track also has distortion and feedback in it. The outro sounds noise rock.    Sister Ray - at 17:27 minutes in length, this track comes across as a trancy Doors song, complete with organ, which is what The Doors had to create their signature sound.  At the start the organ is quite catchy. You later hear a keyboard riff...in Platonic terms, this track sounds to me like the shadow of a much better/catchier song, as far as the keyboard riff goes.  I have to say, I really liked the drum solo in this song, which runs from around 14:10-16-10. It's excellent.  Don't normally associate that element to this band. All round, this track sounds fuzzy, and features the violin. Ding dong, this review is over.           Recommendations:       If you like this album...gee, I don't know what to say...I don't normally listen to albums this weird. Maybe try Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica which is quite a jazzy album, but experimental too.  Or The Stooges debut. That's pretty much all I've got at this time. My wall of weird as far as cds go is quite limited.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|To all those who are saying enough of Smallville...SHUT UP! No one is forcing you to watch. Is Clark Kent ready to put on a cape and assume SUPERMAN status? Perhaps not. If you think the final episode of season eight was anti-climactic, I agree, even if the legendary face-off with Doomsday is with SUPERMAN, and not the 'Red Blue Blur'. Confusion surrounds the disappearance of Lois and too much time is spent in the finale with Chloe and not Clark. All that being said, I loved season eight for being well written and produced. Bloom and Mercer are new and interesting characters but Lex, Martha, and Lionel are sorely missed. (Is Lex really dead?) Looking forward to many more seasons of Smallville, even if they turn out to be only half as good as seasons past.
B001QB9H1K|4.0|By far the best and more realistic Transporter movie I have watched. every stunt felt real ..... unlike in part two where it just feel computer-ry    the only disappointment is casting the leading lady. No disrespect to anyone but there is just too much freckles in her face.

0060989157|5.0|I have always been interested in the lifestyle of rock bands.  I had heard many unbelieveable stories but after reading this book I gained an understanding of how ordinary people, but talented, can so easily get caught up in the fad of the times, whether it  s drugs, alcohol, or sexual practices.  I could not put the book down.  I never use the F word myself, and I am not a prude, but it seems like a natural way of espression to the band members.  Reading it did not offend me but rather helped to understand the lifestyle.  I wish the best for Nikki, Tommy, Mick, and Vince, and I sencerely hope they find the peace and happiness they seek.  By the way, I am 66 years old and have never been a fan of Motley Crue, but I have created an interest in the Crue's personal and professional lives.

0439023491|5.0|I loved the first book and couldn't wait for the second, and Catching Fire lived up to my expectations.  I really bought the books for my pre-teens to read and thought I should read it first to make sure it was appropriate.  It will be difficult for the more sensitive type of young readers, but it is a fast read and it is full of suspense.  I read it in one day because I couldn't stop.  My only complaint is the end.  I felt it was really a hard place for the story to be on hold for a whole year.  Hunger Games ended in a much more logical place.  I can't believe it will be a year before we find out what happens.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|\\"In Treatment\\" the First Season, captured my attention from the first installment. Wonderful acting. Compelling stories. All the elements of a wonderfully written and most intriguing novel \\"live\\" on DVD.
B001SN78JO|4.0|This film was really well done.  It's funny and sweet, has some quite smart lines, and both Carrey and Deschanel were great.  They had obvious chemistry and both brought a level of physical comedy to the story that couldn't have been found in the script.  The story manages to be satirical without being sarcastic.  One thing that distracted me a bit was the glaring age difference between Carrey and Deschanel.  It wasn't a big enough bump that it affected the plot, though.  Well done!
B001N26GFC|4.0|As noted in other reviews here, one's liking of 'Happy-Go-Lucky,' Mike Leigh's latest improvisational gem, depends almost solely on your acceptance of Sally Hawkins' relentlessly optimistic, chatterbox character, Poppy.  Personally, I found her unstintingly charming and endearing, just a real treat on the screen.  [And if you question whether that's acting or just her up there, check out Ms. Hawkins' turn as 'Slasher' in [[ASIN:B0009X7BDC Layer Cake (Widescreen)]].]  I was equally taken with Poppy's flatmate, Zoe, winningly played by Lexi Zegerman.  She won the British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for this portrayal.  Rightfully so: her scenes - almost all with Poppy - help Hawkins flesh out the nature of her character.  Ms. Zegerman is a supporting actress in the best sense of the word.<br /><br />You can't talk about this movie without mentioning Eddie Marsan, flat-out brilliant as Scott the driving instructor, and the polar opposite of Poppy's unending reservoirs of cheerfulness.  It's the scenes of Poppy and Scott together in the car that form the core of the movie.  Poppy bubbling and chattering and joking, Scott seething and resenting and, finally, breaking.  And, when he does break, an astounding rush of pent-up, repressed thoughts come tumbling forth.  If you've seen Leigh's [[ASIN:B0007P0YKY Vera Drake]], you will remember Marsan as the shy, low-key suitor of Drake's daughter.  Same guy!  Now, that's acting.<br /><br />And, d-mn you, Eddie, I've been repeating 'en-ra-ha!' to myself all day!  As his character Scott states, \\"You will remember 'en-ra-ha'.\\"  Indeed!
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Few films achieve such toothy tension, let alone sustain it throughout.  Built on a fantastic cast, flawless direction, and sharp writing, Doubt casts nothing but on every character from the first scene to the last.  Excellent philosophical questions are raised, particularly when a student's mother brings a very unorthodox view to the fore.  Not a family film, but certainly a thought-provoking discussion piece on religious curiosities and good film making.
B000YABIQ6|2.0|Mad Men has surface style, elegance, and enough attention to period fashion, decor, and (low) technology to be a visual feast. It's filmed with cinematic sensibilities (the opening sequence borrows from Hitchcock's \\"Vertigo\\"). The actors are fascinating to look at: they seem to have been chosen based on what was considered movie style beauty fifty years ago. There is enough attention to detail to make merely WATCHING the background sets interesting (I found myself pausing at several points to appreciate the rooms, furniture, wall hangings, and prehistoric office equipment (watching this show is a good way to discover atomic age style and design). All this is interesting--to a point. But the scripts are nothing more than adult soap operas. Unhappy housewives, cheating husbands, men with dark pasts. None of this adds up to much more than what you can get from a daytime soap opera. The fact that more money (a lot more money) and research went into this doesn't redeem it from what it really and truly is: a soap opera. None of the character's tribulations add up to much in the end. And the writers wasted a golden opportunity to say something significant about the time period. Rather than exploit that, they simply threw the same trash into a different era. Watch a few episodes, monitor your boredom, and then move on to something more interesting when you get tired of seeing one more cigarette being put out in one more atomic age ashtray. I did.
B0024RID60|5.0|The remastering job on The Rolling Stones' Some Girls album produces a noticeably superior sound with guitars, vocals, bass and more sounding clearer and sharper than ever; we finally get a REALLY good idea of what The Stones actually sounded like when they recorded these songs.  I love the music on this album; The Rolling Stones demonstrate that they could do a variety of songs and make every one of them sound great! The Stones had very productive recording sessions for this album; and this shows in the high quality control music that we get. The artwork is good even if it's not what was the band originally wanted.<br /><br />Mick Jagger sings \\"Miss You\\" so darn well I'm convinced nobody could have sung it better than he did; his vocals are brought out really well by the remastering job. This disco influenced style of rock music goes just right with his singing and it makes \\"Miss You\\" a very strong opening tune for this album. Jagger and the band bat this straight out of the ballpark; the now extra clear, sharp percussion marks the beat really well. \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" has a distinctly rock flavor to it; this rocks hard and The Rolling Stones deliver this with gusto--to say the least! The music again fits in quite well with the lyrics and that's awesome.<br /><br />\\"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\\" is a shining example of just how well The Stones could cover a song; they sing this one with heart and soul and they never let go of a superfluous note! Mick Jagger in particular has the perfect voice for this tune; and the guitar work enhances this remastered ballad even more. \\"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\\" is a fine example of a rock band covering a tune that certainly wasn't rock when I heard it done by The Temptations!<br /><br />\\"Some Girls,\\" is, of course, the title track and it features an excellent arrangement for guitar. In addition, \\"Far Away Eyes\\" has a fine country flavor; when The Stones perform this they totally amaze me with their incredible sense of timing and their flawless delivery. \\"Far Away Eyes\\" is one of my favorite songs on this album.<br /><br />\\"Respectable\\" features some mighty outstanding, bluesy \\"wailing;\\" but the element of rock is unmistakable and the combination of the bluesy flavor with the hard rock element hold this all together very well. \\"Beast Of Burden\\" is one of their best hits ever; \\"Beast Of Burden\\" has a fine arrangement and Mick Jagger's singing on this remastered, extra clear track proves he can pull it all off without a hitch. Those backup vocals aren't too shabby, either! The album ends strong with The Rolling Stones performing the fierce, punk rock number \\"Shattered\\" which was a huge hit for them; it remains one of their best songs to this day.<br /><br />Overall, the excellent remastering of Some Girls by The Rolling Stones gives us a lot to enjoy. The music is outstanding and, especially with the remastering, this is nothing short of a brilliant work of art. I highly recommend this for fans of The Stones and people who like bands similar to The Rolling Stones.

B002HJBK7E|5.0|It is a tragedy indeed that the writer of this novel, Stieg Larsson, died before he finished the 10 books he had planned. Instead, he wrote 3 books, each better than the last. Our book club read this book and unanimously loved it. The setting (Iceland), the characters, the plot -- all came together to create one hell of a read. The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo has made most of the top ten mystery lists. It is truly a gem. Read it, you won't be sorry.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|It's hard to describe the remarkable consistency in this tribute concert.  From the special composition by Ravi Shankar, to the gratuitous British humor of Monty Python, to the wonderful collection of songs assembled by Eric Clapton, and the incredible ensemble of musicians gathered for this event.  George Harrison was all about love and peace and harmony in the world; and this presentation of his music and other salutations illustrates how much respect he garnered from those around him.  My wife and I have watched this fabulous concert over and over for the last few years and never tire of the fantastic re-creation of so many of those relevant compositions.  Eric Clapton has created a masterpiece with this concert and it should go down as one of the top five music events of this decade.  Kudos to all the musicians and their sincere efforts on behalf of such a great human being.  East and West, North and South; George Harrison set the example that we are all in this together.
0679805273|5.0|I find this little book quite poignant because Dr. Seuss has managed to squeeze the hard won wisdom of adulthood into an innocuous text and without being cynical or disingenuous, tells the young reader that life will be both sweet and sour. It is at heart, though, an exhortation to go out and find the world and be all that you can be. I think this is a wonderful message in a time when there is much concern and fear for the wellbeing of our children which could result in diminished opportunities and fewer adventures as we attempt to shield them. The book is well made and comes in a protective sleeve. Its quality and the removing of the sleeve impressed my daughter and gave our bedtime read a ceremonial flair.

031606792X|5.0|I agree with a lot of the Chicklet's review. Check out specifically the last two paragraphs of her review.<br /><br />1)The book was TOO perfect. Bella got everything she wanted, in addition to being above and beyond the average vampire in her capabilities. There should have been some consequences. It should have been a difficult transformation, with lots of mistakes. Even fewer mistakes would've been acceptable, but it was too much for her to be downright perfect, fresh out of the box.<br />2)I'm not sure that I agree about her having the baby - I would've liked to have seen that happen, but I don't know if that should've been one of the prices she had to pay for the choices she'd made. Jury's still out on that one.<br />3)I too wanted the intimacy between Bella and Edward to be more than it was, though not like a Harlequin, by any means. Sex can definitely be hot and steamy without being trashy or explicit. This was something that had been building since the first book and it would've been satisfying for me as a reader to have had that play a larger part than it did. Bella SHOULD'VE been ecstatic about marring Edward; I kept asking myself all through the book, 'why isn't she excited about this? forever is what she wants, right? I don't understand'.<br />4)Esme should've had a bigger role.<br />5)I wanted a fight with the Volturi. The bad guys should've been SQUASHED!! Or at least, a key player or two, with the possibility of revenge from the Volturi for taking one or more of their treasures. I don't know if that was a door left open for a future book or not, but I was every much let down when that battle didn't happen. It was almost like Meyer got so far into the book and then ran out of steam and just decided to end it quickly. And what was the point of J. Jenks and Alice leaving Bella to make all those preparations? Just because she 'might' need them? Edward or Bella should've gotten hurt, possibly near death, Nessie and Jacob could've disappeared, and whomever was left unscathed should've been in agony over the disappearance of one and the possible death of the other. And then from there, who knows where the story would lead....<br />6)I agree with what Chicklet said about the death of Rosalie. I could VERY much see that happening.<br />7) I wanted to see Bella develop a deeper relationship with Alice. I LOVED Alice!<br />8) Jacob was just downright pathetic. Pitiful. I'm glad the pack went into league w/ the vampires, but Bella should've never been able to keep him as a friend, and he should not have imprinted on Nessie. And so what would that mean, when Nessie grows up? The half vampire and the 'wolf get married?<br /><br />NOW ALL THAT BEING SAID....!!!  I still enjoyed this book immensely!! I could not put it down. I've never known what it meant for a book to be 'riveting' before, and I've read some AWESOME books. I laughed out loud at times, and sobbed at others. My heart broke for Bella in the beginning, and I literally jumped for joy when Alice showed up at the confrontation w/ the Volturi. Though there were many times I could see WHERE Meyer was going with certain things, I NEVER anticipated HOW she was going to get there. All in all, the whole series, including this last, was very much worth the whole month I put into reading all four books. I've never devoured so much material in so little time.hould've been in agony over the disappearance of one and the possible death of the other.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is a great show, after watching the first couple of episodes I didnt want to stop.  Great adaptation of the book.  The creaters have done a good job with the storyline from the book as well as making some changes.  If you like vampires and Alan Balls other series Six Feet Under you will love this show!!!
1573300403|5.0|This DVD is well worth the time it takes to watch. I loved it. Got a few minutes? Here's why, in intimate detail:<br /><br />I must admit, it's been quite a while since I sat and watched Michael Jackson videos one after another. But now I'm looking at them through different eyes, trying to make sense of his senseless death, and whatever is being written or broadcast about him these days, I find I simply cannot look away right now. I want to know everything, and remember, and thank him somehow. Was there ever an entertainer before this who stripped himself naked for us, asked us to really see who he was, in so many ways? I don't think so. He makes us willing voyeurs, and welcomes our intrusion.<br /><br />I've just finished watching Michael Jackson: HIStory on Film Volume II with those new eyes I mentioned. Some of the videos included on it I've seen many times before, but now they are clearly valuable as a chronicle of the evolution of a unique performer.<br /><br />The teaser is very funny and over the top, a good example of the famously wicked MJ sense of humor, in this case spoofing himself. Here also you have the seminal introduction of moonwalking and Michael-bling in the Motown 25 live performance of \\"Billie Jean\\", and this is a performance that really has a sense of defiance to it, saying \\"Here I am on my own, not The Jacksons but THE Jackson, and get ready coz I'm happening!\\" It's also interesting as the first public indication that this artist was not going to stay in the Motown \\"standard\\" for very much longer. Included also is the slightly vague and disjointed \\"Billie Jean\\" video, historical as the first video by a black performer to be shown on MTV, not really satisfying on its own but rather an omen of better things to come...<br /><br />And here's the huge Grammy winner \\"Beat It\\", where MJ now seems such a young naïve idealist and is all forearms and legs, a gawky fawn with attitude and grace that surprises you, and the determination to show you what he thinks about gang violence whether you want to hear or not. Contrast this much simpler video with the huge scope of another idealistic video, \\"Earth Song\\", where his need to speak out to us about serious social and global issues is again evident but the level of sophistication and production complexity has increased exponentially, as has the level of emotion Michael puts into his performance. The local residents recruited for the video are awesome. It's clear that he really feels deeply what he has written about in this song, and it makes a striking and interesting video. Gives me goosepimples.<br /><br />The MJ ideals are given another outing in \\"They Don't Care About Us\\", this is the Brazil version, with director Spike Lee providing an edgy forum for Michael's growing displeasure with \\"them\\", and frankly, given the impressive logistics that must have gone into filming this piece, I can't imagine anyone but Michael Jackson being able to pull it off. (Well... okay, maybe Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford, but they probably weren't available that day...)<br /><br />Speaking of Spielberg, there he was amongst the movie and television luminaries (and holy primates, Batman, it's Bubbles the chimp, conversing with Suzanne Somers!) that were gathered to cameo in MJ's charming video \\"Liberian Girl\\", and here is one of the perfect examples of Michael's huge love of movies. He expressed in many interviews his fascination with film past and future, and after playing the scarecrow in \\"The Wiz\\", which he loved doing, it really fired his desire to express himself cinematically. The music, though in the background in the video, seems to have come right from a 1930's musical night club act. As you finally see him behind the camera at the end of the video, his joy at the fun of it is written all over his face; even though he seems a bit shy, he just beams. A sweet piece. So is the dedication to Elizabeth Taylor.<br /><br />This joy and fun were also at the core of the (dare I say) immortal video \\"Thriller\\", which I dearly love, because Michael is so obviously having a blast and sharing that with us every minute. I've seen this video so many times, but somehow it (and the song) never gets old. The song all by itself is terrific, and the lyrics (and the inimitable Vincent Price's poetry delivery) always make me smile - having grown up fiercely addicted to the Friday night screamfest called \\"Creature Features\\" in my home town, I have happy memories of scaring myself silly watching classic horror films every week and dreaming of monsters and ghouls all night. However, none of them ever danced quite as wonderfully as Michael, and I will see his devilish grin and wolfish eyes at the end of this video in my mind forever. Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson was a match made in musical heaven and I'm sure they both knew it very well. Adding John Landis to the mix (after his success with \\"Werewolf in London\\") really frosted the cake and changed music video forever.<br /><br />Also on this DVD is another very cinematic video, among my favorites - \\"Smooth Criminal\\".  Here MJ gets into a complex dance number with a sort of a gangsta plot that's really fun to watch, he gets to hoof it a la Fred Astaire (whom he named at 18 as one of his early inspirations) and we get a taste of his propensity to get kids into his videos. (The little boy who \\"taught him all he knows\\" and imitates MJ's moves is really cute. Wonder what he's doing now?) However - I would have liked to see more of Michael dancing alone in this video, instead of getting lost in the crowd so much. And wow, time for another stark contrast: look at \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and \\"Blood on the Dance Floor\\", where suddenly MJ doesn't look like a kid wearing Fred Astaire's costume anymore but rather a grown man with great presence and intensity and sexual energy (and OMG doesn't he look killer in dark red leather and satin! Whew!) I had not seen this video before, and he blew me away. Here he really is as much a trained dancer as he is a singer/composer. His body is filled out more, he moves with more forcefulness, he actually dances with a partner, and is really impressive in a rather overwhelmingly sensual video - lots of color and eye candy. Ignore the negative comments on this one, it's a keeper. As in the other video though, he gets lost in the crowd of other dancers too many times for my taste.  (Do all video editors have Attention Deficit Disorder? Stop hopping around, guys! Let the scene flow!)<br /><br />Another surprise on this DVD is the MTV awards performance, which is almost worth the price of the thing all by itself. Lucky MTV audience! An extended live performance by any television measure, with perfectly timed pyro and Slashy geetar majic (if the guy wears any more jewelry he may electrocute himself on his guitar! hahaha), and several extended dance numbers (including a tantalizing portion of one of my all-time favorite MJ songs, \\"Dangerous\\"), a reprise of \\"You Are Not Alone\\", and oh yes, kids. Michael seems extremely open, genuine and happy on this particular evening, a feeling seemingly not shared by Lisa Marie Presley, who the cameras hunt down and expose with rather sour and grumpy looks on her face.<br /><br />And of course we get a full serving of Lisa Marie in the video \\"You Are Not Alone\\", which is a really great song, a beautiful sentiment, and very well sung ... but the video troubles me a bit. It seems to be another moment of Michael baring and sharing who he really is with us, and the intimacy becomes rather excruciating (not to mention extremely revealing!), and I haven't figured out who he is in it yet or what he really wants to say. The angel shots are a bit unsettling too, viewed in 2009... And right alongside this video in the \\"Yikes, Michael, did you really have to tell us that?\\" department is \\"Childhood\\", which I had not seen before, and for a moment I thought I was seeing Janet Jackson behind the soft focus! But of course it wasn't, and there were all these kids, with dreams in their eyes... and magical flying boats... and by the end of it I was sniffling, dammit. He's stripping off layers of himself again and I'm never quite ready, especially when he hits a nerve in my own complicated psyche.<br /><br />Janet Jackson does however turn up with MJ in \\"Scream\\", a sort of space fantasy with very cool costumes and lots of special effects (Fred Astaire would have loved the dancing on the ceiling parts, Michael, another salute to the past from you) and lyrics that must have been very satisfying for both of the performing siblings to express, especially when directed at the media, and rather ironic to see now given the general crucifixion Michael got in the press in 2003-2005. This is a very interesting video visually, obviously cost a small fortune to produce, but not a song that stays with you terribly long. I enjoyed seeing the brother-sister dynamics though.<br /><br />\\"Stranger in Moscow\\" is another one I suspect was inspired by honest emotion on MJ's part, and heck, he might have even written it in Moscow; I'm sure he went there at some point, and I'm sure he was lonely. He was a (beloved) stranger all over the world and completely alone in huge masses of people. The pervasive loneliness of his life pops out at various moments in his music and interviews, and this video hits you in a stark place, is even shot in black and white to increase the detachment about which Michael sings. It brings forward the silence that is the flip side of all the hullabaloo and excitement of fame and touring and performing: it's the thoughts that come when you're alone in the middle of the night. Don't watch this video if you're contemplating suicide and it's raining.<br /><br />Finally, the HIStory Volume II DVD treats us to a mind-numbing epilogue of sorts, which plunges us into a frenetic compressed hyper-edited Michael's-eye view of what his touring life was like. (Hey, let's hang a sign on the sound tower so the guy remembers where he is tonight!) It ends with what I'm sure was meant at the time of its release in 1995 as a positive, endearing, encouraging grabber of a teaser line: \\"BRACE YOURSELF\\".  We were to look forward, more to come, stay tuned!<br /><br />Well, as they say in the movies, \\"we wuz robbed\\". His impassioned and improbable personal life has deprived us of the next iteration of Michael Jackson and all the fabulous ideas that were still rattling around in his marvelously talented brain. Personally I think that \\"This Is It\\" would have been just what he needed to turn it all around, and probably cathartic too, but I suppose it could have done damage if it had turned out to be less than the success the perfectionist that he was all his life he was used to, and needed. Sadly we'll never know. The good news is that his extensive musical legacy will live on for a long time, more things will appear out of various vaults and collections and get released to the public, and other performers will want to keep it alive in their own interpretations too. But to see the incomparable Michael Jackson, as he really was, in all his guises and disguises, you'll need all of the videos, warts and all.

B00280GDFQ|4.0|I loved this movie.  I was not sure what to expect when I started watching it.  I had some good things but did not really have an interest in seeing this film.  I was completely hooked through the entire moive, I loved the story line and the characters.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I am fans from Hong Kong.  The \\"Dangerous\\" album is excellent, it is even better than \\"BAD\\". I love almost all the songs in this album    Songs included:  - Heal The World  - In the Closet  - Black or White  - Who Is It  - Dangerous  - Give It To Me  - Will You Be There  - Why you wanna trip on me  etc ........    The one I love the most is \\"Who Is It\\", very good music arrangement, whatever melody, rhythm and composition.  It is an outstanding piece of Michael Jackson. My opinion is that this is the album you must have at home. I greatly suggest you to buy the CD, not download from the website, as the package is very valuable, especialy the booklet inside, that you can never get from download.  This album is much WORTH to buy.    Michael is always the King Of Pop!  His music never dies!
B002BBJ52U|1.0|This movie was pretty boring and not funny.  Not to mention it really portrays women as being very desperate and stupid, and men as dogs.  The ending was alright but pretty predictable.  Great cast, but not worth watching....
B00015TWTE|5.0|I am Michael Jackson's fans from Hong Kong.  This album \\"History Past, Present & Future Book 1\\" is excellent, it is the album of Michael you must have at home.  This album has two CDs, Disc 1 includes the old famous songs, such as Billie Jean, Beat It and etc....  Disc 2 includes all new songs, all the terrific good songs with messages, all about Michael's anger, anguish, accusation, sensation and his view.<br /><br />Songs included:<br />- Stranger in Moscow (talks about his entertainment businss, suddenly falls from grace)<br /><br />- You Are Not Alone (quite a sad, about lonely, with his 1st wife Lisa in the Music Video)<br /><br />- Earth Song (something about enviromental protection)<br /><br />- Childhood (about his loss in childhood and painful youth, very touching, you will burst into tears once you listen this song)<br /><br />- They Don't Care About Us (the accusation for the people whom always set and sue him, the police abrutality, and etc...)<br /><br />- D.S. (D.S. is a name, talk about the proscutor, during the child molestation case in 1993)<br /><br />Other songs such as Scream, History, Money and etc...<br /><br />This was the album that Michael made after his child molestation allegation in 1993; really an excellent and terrific album you must buy.<br /><br />I suggest you should buy a CD not download from the website, as you can never get the package from download, especially the booklet inside, which is priceless and valuable.<br /><br />Michael, you are always King of Pop, and your music never dies.
0307269752|2.0|I can't believe all the stellar reviews this book is getting! In all honesty, this novel is brainless. I love to read, I've read a lot of books in my day, and I've got nothing against Swedish people (my mom's from Minnesota), but this book is just plain insensate.<br /><br />First of all, all the locations and people's are Swedish names (Blomkvist, Henrik, etc) which takes some getting used to used to.  In fact, it's painful - they're constantly discussing this family and trying to keep the family members straight is a chore.<br /><br />Secondly, the book is way too long. One could easily cut out half the pages, with not a bit of important information lost, and it would make for a better, more exciting read. Throughout the book the character's day-to-day activities are discussed in minute detail. This guy Blomkvist (our protagonist) ends up stuck living on an island near a very small community. The story centers around him - what time he gets up, what he has for breakfast, where he goes, when he goes into a coffee shop, what he says to the waitress - all of which has absolutely no bearing on the story.<br /><br />Third, the story is just plain dumb. The character's reasons for doing things makes you wonder if the author is really a third grader (I may be insulting third-graders. Sorry :). At one point the story discusses this girl leaving after a traumatic experience with huge bags under her eyes because she had been crying, then on THE VERY NEXT PAGE it says \\"she did not cry\\"... What? Did Stieg even proofread his own novel?<br /><br />Lastly, the story is anticlimactic. Towards the end, when they finally figure out who the murderer is, don't expect an exciting sequence. The climax lasts all of about four or five pages, and is poorly written. Then the protagonist goes gallivanting around the world to find this person that did not have much reason to be hiding in the first place and, in all honesty, no reader, by that point, even cares about. Give me a break.<br /><br />I was very disappointed with this novel. It is NOT exciting. There are a few engrossing portions scattered throughout, but these are few and far between. I honestly believe the author wrote the story, decided it was too short, and went back and watered the whole thing down with minutae that adds nothing to the plot.<br /><br />In this case, maybe at least the movie will be better than the book.vel.

0061537969|5.0|This is a story you will never forget.  A story you will always think about and see how it applies to your own life. If we do pursue our own life as if we \\"were racing in the rain\\" then maybe this world would be better place, with a little more harmony, especially if you own a pet.
B000088E77|5.0|Business As Usual is probably one of my favorite 80s albums made.  Colin Hay's vocals are fantastic and the music is wonderful, I have always loved Men At Work.  If you haven't already bought this album go ahead and pick it up you wont be disappointed.

0066620996|5.0|Good book that will motivate you and show you that there is not an easy way to become a sucess. It takes hard work, preparation then a bit of luck.
B000Z27HLS|3.0|I didn't mind the overall movie - however; it just cut off too abruptly.  There really wasn't enough time to develop the love interest between the two main characters - the movie should have gone on for at least another 1/2 hour to an hour.  It just became too disjointed for me.  The audience gets the idea that the two will eventually get together.  But it does not build up to that moment with the usual Austen suspense.  I bought it because it finished my set.
0060974176|5.0|Great book for introduction into lean manufacturing, a must read.  This book gets you thinking abou the bottle necks and \\"Theory of Constraints\\".
0316154687|4.0|I love reading David  Sedaris books, but this one was not as funny as the others.  Worth reading though....
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This British period romance is addicting!  You will want to watch this over and over.  It not only gives insights into life in the cotton mills in England and how challenging those times were, but it shows the good and bad sides of all the characters.  You see them as more realistic people and shows how people can change given certain circumstances.  We love this video and the acting professionalism is superb.  Highly recommended!

B001J6NZGU|4.0|Sure, women can have it all these days.  But the question posed by Diane English in her 2008 update on THE WOMEN is: do they really want it all?<br /><br />If anyone was going to create a modern-day spin on Clare Boothe Luce's catty 1930's Broadway play, THE WOMEN (made famous in the 1939 MGM movie starring Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford), it was \\"Murphy Brown\\" scribe Diane English.  While time has rolled on, the problems concerning women certainly haven't.<br /><br />When down-to-earth Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) discovers that her husband has taken on a seductive perfume counter clerk named Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes) as his mistress, she paints her nails jungle-red and reinvents herself as a boutique fashion designer - but not without some support from her faithful gal-pals including magazine editor Sylvie (Annette Bening), \\"serial mother\\" Edie (Debra Messing) and outspoken lesbian author Alex (Jada Pinkett Smith).<br /><br />As in the original, no man ever appears on screen, and Ms English has wisely retained many of the best lines from the source material (there's also a clever black-and-white twist on the original's Technicolor fashion show sequence!) .  While a lot of what English newly creates for the remake might seem fresh and cutting edge - ie: Mary's eleven-year-old daughter (India Ennenga) who starts smoking to suppress her appetite - I think she's tried too hard to cram in as many modern elements as possible, making the film seem overstuffed with information.  The crux of the story remains Mary's reinvention, and Meg Ryan portrays that nicely.  And I appreciate the fact that, unlike the original in which we see Norma Shearer (as Mary) tearfully running back into her husband's arms; the question of whether Mary will in fact return to her marriage is left up to the audience.<br /><br />Fantastic performances all-round, particularly from Messing, Bening and Pinkett Smith as the main trio; Cloris Leachman is the Haines housekeeper and has some great scenes, and no Diane English film would be complete without \\"Murphy Brown\\" herself, Candice Bergen, who plays Mary's mother.  Bette Midler has an all-too-brief bit as a burnt-out, multiple-divorced Hollywood agent.  There are also appearances from Joanna Gleason, Carrie Fisher and Ana Gasteyer.complete without \\"Murphy Brown\\" herself, Candice Bergen, who plays Mary's mother.

B001EAWMGA|5.0|I WASN'T EXPECTING TOO MUCH, HAVING NEVER REALLY HEARD ABOUT OR SEEN ANY TRAILERS FOR THE MOVIE AND OF COURSE, THE LOCAL VIDEO STORE DECIDED THAT ONE COPY WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE CITY. BUT I GOTTA SAY I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THIS FLICK! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ANY SCI-FI FAN. FULL OF ACTION, WICKED SCENES, FANTASTIC EFFECTS, SOME PRETTY GOOD ACTING, AND A GREAT STORYLINE TO BOOT!
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time from one of my favorite musicians of all time. His live albums are also fantastic. I was even lucky enough to see him live when I lived near philly a few years ago. There is no one like Damien Rice. Anyone who hasn't listened to him, should listen to this CD. For those who do like Damien Rice, check out the two ladies who play in the group, (Lisa Hannigan and Vyvienne Long) they have excellent music also. Buy this CD, its a masterpiece.
0060920084|2.0|This travel journal had such good potential but Mr. Bryson blew it. He timed his destinations in seasons of bad weather and missed so many opportunities. I did enjoy his anecdotes of traveling with his family during his childhood. I suggest, now that he is older, another road trip. Only this time consult an almanac so he can see things that are not covered in fog, snow, and sleet. I have enjoyed other books of his but cannot recommend this one. He comes across as sour and unfair in some of his critical commentary.

0792164903|4.0|Everyone put in a great performance in this movie, Christopher Walkin (doesn't he ever play anything other than a psycho in the movies?). I thought this film looked interesting when it first came out in the theaters but never got around to watching it. Johnny Depp shows his ability to create unique characters in his portrayal of Constable Ichabob Crane in this rendition of the classic tale. The film keeps you wondering throughout.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The movie was just as promised, and the speed with which the order was processed was terrific!
0380001225|5.0|This is the story of a young woman full of creativity and potential, finding her way in the New York entertainment industry. It is also the story of Londoners after the war. Then there is the story of a woman who is not content to call herself educated just because she has attended school; she is on a quest for knowledge and fine writing. But those are the things which I have read into the book, and there is so much more there. Essentially, it is a collection of letters between two like-minded people who love books. Helene Hanff's humor leaps out at you and the personal and sweet tone of these missives makes you feel you have known the writers.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Experiencing Braveheart on blu-ray brings the masterpiece to life like never before. I will never forget that weekend when I first saw Braveheart in the local theaters back in 1995, I came back home awestruck at the brutality and the power displayed in the film, it instantly became one of my favorite films of all time and it inspired a whole new generation of films that brought back the epic back into cinemas. Newer films like Gladiator are also impressive, but not so like the one that started it all. Braveheart comes to blu-ray with an impressive video transfer and sound quality. The visuals pop out of the screen and James Horner's soundtrack thunders in its excellence. Braveheart is truly a treasure to behold, I strongly recommend this!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|One of the best compilations ever of a legend's songbook. Wanting to replace vinyl with CDs I started to purchase all of Young's great recordings and then found this collection, which captures the best of his music over the years. Dig the cover photo, too.
0385341075|5.0|Mr Pip ,by LLoyd Jones, is an onion of a novel. By that I mean it is layered in an intricately woven manner to encompass a myriad of themes. At first it is a deceptively simple tale set on  the lush tropical island of Bouganville where the native population,isolated and blockaded, are facing a civil war of deprivation and horror.Into the mix comes the only white inhabitant who remained after others fled,Mr Watts. He steps up to take over the abandoned schoolhouse and thus becomes the Pied Piper of Bouganville. Through his storytelling of Dicken's Great Expectations he provides a safe haven for the war stricken children . They immediately succomb to the power of the written word and are transported to  Victorian England where they meet Pip who in some ways is like each one of them. Imagination takes them away from the immediate horror of civil war. Mr Pip becomes a savior of sorts especially to Matilda, the young Narrator.  But Mr Watt's hold on the children  causes  issues with the parents who see his approach  as a threat to religious beliefs and cultural allegiance. These differences of culture and dogmatic approach lead to a stand off between Mr Watts and Dolores, Matilda's mother. This clash will create unlikely heroes as the war encroaches and moral decisions must be made. There is great symbolism here for a world where races and cultures face major changes in an ever more global world.  When the only copy of Great Expectations disappears and the soldiers demand to see a fictional Mr Pip,(who they believe to be a real spy) there are terrible reprecussions.  Storytelling becomes the weapon of choice at first, as it soothes the savage rambos who are really just misguided school children at heart.The seven nights of Mr Watts' storytelling are a heroic  vehicle to stall until an  escape plan is put into effect.  But storytelling  has created a great dilemma too, as there is no real Mr. Pip to offer up to the demanding redskins who appear savagely and without warning. I will not divulge any more of the plot but suffice it to say that Great Expectations causes major life changing effects  as Matilda moves into a future off the island. The novel is a homage to literature, to teachers who change destinies, to clashes of cultures and racial divides, to the horrors of war ,to the power of the written word , to the empowering value of imagination and to the religious and moral values that sometimes  must collide and  clash  before there can be compromises. This small novel offers huge issues to ponder . Mr Jones has exceeded many expectations with this novel.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|I'm prejudiced because Carlos Santana and his bands have been my favorite music and source of percussion inspiration for over thity years.
B001KVZ6ES|1.0|I wish I never bought this because it was a big waste of money.  My daughter said that I would love it and she was wrong.  I definitely should have rented it.  Personal preference, I guess.  I'm sure some people thought it was great.   Not me.
B000007UEY|5.0|I was a huge Genesis fan in the late '70s to mid '80s.  I lost interest after they started going more mainstream commercial pop in the late '80s/early '90s.  I loved the etherial, introspective, classically influenced rock music that Genesis made from their beginning thru ABACAB.  I also consumed most of the bands solo projects.  To be honest, I have been hugely disappointed in most of the solo projects with the exception of the following three albums: Spectral Mornings by Steve Hackett, Face Value by Phil Collins and Smallcreep's Day by Mike Rutherford.  Out of those three Smallcreep's Day is the true masterpiece IMHO.  The album unfortunately received very little fanfare and notice by music critics as well as Genesis fans, at least in the US.  Trust me, if you like golden era Genesis music you will love Smallcreep's Day!<br /><br />As a personal side note, I had the good fortune of meeting Mike Rutherford in the lobby of the Four Season's Hotel in downtown Houston Texas in May 1986.  He was on tour with his new band Mike & the Mechanics.  He and the band were checking into the hotel and I just happened to be there on the same afternoon attending my sisters wedding reception.  As a long term Genesis fan I just had to say \\"hello\\".  He was extremely gracious and polite to me in a traditional English way.  Quite the gentleman I thought.  I have one huge regret from that brief encounter.  As I was telling him what a great and long term Genesis fan I was I totally forgot to tell him how much I love Smallcreep's Day and how I think it is far and away the best solo album by any current or former member of Genesis.  I am confident that compliment would have been far more endearing to him than the stereotypical Genesis dribble I was eschewing because the album experienced such modest sales.  So I guess I am sharing this story here on Amazon in the hope of receiving some absolution.  After all these years I can't seem to shake the regret.  Sorry about that Mike.  I truly love Smallcreep's Day.  It is a very unique, special and brilliant album.lcreep's Day.  It is a very unique, special and brilliant album.
1582701709|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as it came to me that the right time. I don't think it's for everyone at all times. A person has to be willing to receive the information at the time that they read it to be able to have it be life changing.<br /><br />That said, I have never recommended a book more often.  It is exceedingly straight forward in how to change your mental view.  I have applied it and found it to be very true.<br /><br />I do believe that most are afraid to believe that they are in control of their own destiny.  For those, who read this of that mind set, you will often get feedback that focuses on how \\"materialist\\" this book is.  They might site examples of how The Secret has failed them in their life.<br /><br />However, the book's message is exceedingly simple.  You are the master of your own reality.  If you think about it, it is not so different to what is taught in most religions and philosophies. How many times has a friend come to you full of sadness, lack of confidence, etc?  And while you have tried to mentor/inspire/coax them to emotional/spiritual/mental wellness, you know that that has to come from within them.<br /><br />The key to accepting the message of this book is taking it in at the right time.  I would caution those that love this book and it's message to keep that in mind when suggesting it to their friends who might desperately need it.<br /><br />A note though, I note that many people who have seen the DVD version tend to find \\"The Secret\\" too materialistic.  Indeed, relative to the book, the DVD is a bit materialistic.  It is unfortunate that the book is so much better and the DVD appears to send a message that is quite different from the author's original intent.  The books on tape is completely identical to the book. If you're recommending to friends, make sure they either get the book or books on tape, as they may have similar issues with their interpretation of the DVD.
B000053VAF|5.0|Dogma is a movie with comedy, drama, and a wonderful look at religion. It watches almost like a parody, and with the language and some crude humor, it would be very easy to get offended, but watch it with an open mind and you will see the real story. Rufus, the black 13th apostle, gives us some great insight into what we really should be doing as followers of Christ. He gives a line to the effect of, 'You guys took a great thing and built a religion around it.' Plus, Alan Rickman is a very attractive Metatron!

0385247125|5.0|This is a great book and must have for any Michael Jackson fan!  The book was sent to me very promptly and in mint condition.  Reading Moon Walk was an interesting read, as Michael opened up his heart and used his own words to tell his story.  May Michael rest in peace.
0307388921|1.0|I don't normally read novels.  I picked this one up in order to enthuse me back into reading novels.  What a total put-off this was?  Could not keep myself  interested beyond the first ninety pages.  The characters are hazy and there's no plot.  The rule of adding a touch of sex to anything to make it work does not cut it with this novel.  This book is going straight to the bin!
1439138311|2.0|I never connected with the characters so I didn't mind one way or another what happened to them. Because it was a very readable book I stuck with it. However, I wish I had moved on to another of my list of books to read because the ending was the worst part of this book.

B0017VG66I|5.0|There may not be two better Westerns ever made. Both movies explore the settling of the West and the battle between the ranchers (bad guys) and the settlers (good guys).<br /><br />Shane's beautiful photography is spellbinding. Alan Ladd and Van Heflin turn in great performances and Jean Arthur is stunning. The supporting cast is unbelievable.<br /><br />Liberty Valance, shot in B/W, also has stunning photography. John Wayne, James Stewart and Lee Marvin are in top form. Many, many great moments in this movie (\\"No, YOU pick it up Valance\\", \\"Print the legend\\").<br /><br />This is great double feature (just like the old days) at a very affordable price!
B001R60ESE|5.0|The 7.1 True HD audio 7.1 is amazing, the song selection is great, a must have!
B001OQCV9M|5.0|Telling two stories in parallel is difficult and this movie struggles a little in the process, but overall it is truly an outstanding movie.  I thought Meryl Streep deserved an academy award for her performance -- it was brilliant.  In fact this movie portrayed marriage in the most favorable light I have seen in years and it certainly showed marriage as I have experienced it.  All of the characters in this movie came across as real and likeable people.  I thought the male leads were sort of kept in the background and the movie would have benefited if they had been given a larger role but the movie was still one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />The cooking scenes were absolutely outstanding and clearly illustrated how difficult it is too cook gourmet meals.  Very few people cook like this and the movie indirectly shows how hard it is because the shopping alone is difficult.  Of course Julia Child cooked the \\"French\\" way which meant fresh ingredients procured the day of use.  Practical in Paris but not so practical in New York.  The movie showed this but never focused on it.  The movie also showed how men love their wives and support them.  There was no dysfunctionality in these marriages.  A great movie.
B00001OH7P|5.0|When I first heard this album in 1972, I was floored. In an era of Deep Purples, Zeppelins and Black Sabbaths, Bowie's freeze-dried Ziggy Starbust had a lot of surreal imagery that changed the face of pop music. No longer was it just dumb music to nod off on. It was different, weird but it rocked with a new attitude of glam-rock star personna. Every cut on this classic album is enjoyable. My Faves': Suffragette City, Star, Moonage Daydream, Ziggy Stardust, Hang On To Yourself, Soul Love and the sound is punchy and clean and in your face and the band rocks out like highly energized speed freaks. One of the best 20 albums of all time and Bowie's best. It is a surreal dream!
B001OQCV2Y|3.0|I am not a Tarantino Fan and generally think his films make little sense and this was no exception.  Why I let myself get dragged to this was only due to the rave reviews offered by my nephew. I thought Brad Pitt does his best with a part he is ill suited to play but since this is a fantasy his awkward performance underscores the unreality of the entire piece.  The screen play does not develop any characters beyond paper cutouts.  The entire band of Jewish soldiers are never developed as characters and hardly have names.  What their purpose or objective is, is never made clear and the scalping scenes were typical Tarantino shock scenes that had no purpose other than to offer up gore.  This film dragged on and on with the camera lingering on some of the most violent scenes, like the killing of the German Sergeant.  In fact this entire movie portrayed the American Soldiers in the worst light possible -- soldiers who were brutal, violent, and without a shred of honor.  The German soldiers came across as professional soldiers doing their duty while the Americans were little more than a roving band of murderers.  Of course there was nothing even remotely close to historical reality in this film.  It is so far from reality it might have been directed by Oliver Stone, but if you like Tarantino and his violence you'll like this movie.<br /><br />I gave this movie three stars because of the performance of Christoph Waltz.  His performance as the German SS Colonel was mesmerizing.  He turned in a brilliant performance speaking German, English, Italian, and French with ease.  In fact he carries the entire movie and without him this movie would have just been overly long, overly violent, and idiotic, but his performance raises the entire cast and screen play to a movie worth seeing.  Of course the ending is ridiculous but then there was nothing real about this movie from the outset.  Christopher Waltz was brilliant and deserves an academy award -- he makes the entire movie worth the price of admission.rice of admission.

0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin is a master of this genre. She brings to life Lincoln and his colleagues through meticulous research of primary sources (and citing many secondary sources) in an exceptionally interesting and informative way. She allows us to truly understand why Lincoln was our greatest president, and how he steered this nation through the philosophical and political crises involved in ending slavery. This momentous work truly deserved the Pulitzer in my opinion.
B00012BSHG|5.0|My 4 year old LOVES this pool.  It's a great size for him, plenty of room to splash and swim.  This sides really are as sturdy as they claim -- he was able to put all of his weight on the edge of the pool without any issues -- it hardly moved.  It doesn't take up much more space than a typical molded plastic kiddie pool, but is deeper and much more fun.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|It's \\"CSI:Miami\\" with a twist--and a million times better-acted. The twist is, of course, that Miami-based forensic analyst Dexter Morgan helps to solve murders by day, and by night--well, he commits murders of his own. Or, if you prefer, executions. While Dexter is in his own estimation, a monster due to his fondness for strapping his carefully-selected victims down with Saran Wrap and drawing their blood for his slide collection before dispatching them in grisly fashion with power tools it's hard not to cheer on, at least a tiny bit, a serial killer who only kills the degenerate and the guilty in a city known for its degeneration. Twisted killer or vigilante superhero dispensing midnight justice? You may find yourself reconsidering just what and who is depraved here. Michael C. Hall creates a, dare I say it, teddy-bearish decent kind of Everyman killer, a Dark Knight with a boring wardrobe and a self-esteem problem, and it's impossible not to be charmed. The supporting cast and seedy tropical vibe of Miami are spot-on. How Dexter will continue to ply his trade (both of them) in subsequent seasons will be interesting to watch. Kudos to the most inventive title sequence, like, ever, too.
B001CIPU3G|4.0|I noticed that the band changed styles slightly with this album. I am not sure if it is just natural progression or if the change was dictated by an outside source. (ie record labels). All in all I enjoyed the album and would recommend it to anyone looking for more from the the band.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|3.5 stars. Javier Bardem won an Oscar for playing an essentially sexless, emotionless murderer with a supremely dorky haircut. Here he displays his Continental sex god charm to full effect as a bohemian painter who romances not one, but three separate women over the course of a summer in Barcelona. Mr. Bardem espressed wonderment in a magazine interview that he got paid to make love to three gorgeous women in the same movie. Why not, say I? This Spaniard is sexy as all get out. Woody Allen's muse du jour, Scarlett Johansson can't even compete on the sexy scale with Bardem, though she tries a lot harder. As if we needed further evidence that Woody Allen is a lecherous old man, here it is! Though it is contrived and self-conscious in the manner of all Allen films (was a Narrator really necessary? I say not), I ended up liking this anyway. Penelope Cruz channels Frida Kahlo to chew the scenery and what scenery it is. You will want to do two things immediately after watching this movie: book your ticket to Barcelona and run, don't walk, to the store to get a copy of the dance-tastic Latin soundtrack. A project that ends up being less than the sum of its parts, but the individual parts make it pretty good.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|This turned out to be an outstanding movie. The movie starts out portraying the horrors done to the Jewish people by the Nazi regime. The American forces come up with an answer for the Nazis. A group commanded by Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt) and seven other Jewish soldiers are turned into a unit called the Inglorious Basrards. They reak  havoc on Nazi troops all along the War theater. They also scalp their Nazi victims. They are becoming feared everywhere. The Nazis hate to see them coming. The owner of a movie theater in Nazi occupied France (a young   lady who lost her relatives to the Nazis) comes to know  a German soldier. He is a sniper who is a German war hero. The Nazi propoganda machine makes a movie about him. He wants to premier the movies at the young ladie's movie theater. After many gunbattles and undercover work by Raine and his group they discover that the Nazi heirarchy including Hitler are coming to see the movie. They  come up with a master plan to kill the whole bunch. Unknown to the the young lady who owns the theater also9 has a plan for revenge. The premiere of the movie is one to remember. The ending is unique and original. Brad Pitt outdoes himself. Be sure to see this movie.
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is a masterpiece second to Grapes of Wrath among Steinbecks works. The novel is heavily allegorical so if you dont like allegory even if well done you wont like this novel. However the allegory works for me and I enjoy welldone allegory. The novel is quite philosophical at times but it is compelling throughout.I enjoy a more philosophical novel so this really works for me. This is a masterpiece and is thought provoking on the nature of good and evil and how initial perceptions can dominate a person that even reality cannot  break it down completely as Adams misjudgement of Catherine leads him to favor the son that strongly resembles her with bad results a great novel
0618871713|5.0|I really liked the style the author used to tell her memoir. She used the style called 'graphic' which is an adult comic book, to put it simply. I was very moved by this book, and by all the drawings that showed so much detail. I was disappointed when the book ended, I wanted to read more..and look at more pictures.  :) I have explored her website, and I am interested in reading more of her life..from the comic strip \\"Dykes To Watch Out For\\" I strongly recommend this book.

6305842418|5.0|As someone from the tornado belt with some meteorology ed., twisters can and at times do hit in assembly line fashion.  A large strong high pressure system encountering an equally strong low one can spawn ongoing havoc and tornadoes along the colliding systems as they move.     The best thing about this film is that it draws us in by recreating all manner of twister stories we have heard as part of our urban legend education. This brought as much success to the film as the terrific special effects.     If you're from tornado alley as I am, stories of flying cows, raining tractors, boards melding into trees, 'going green' skies, 'cones of silence' and more are part of the tornado lore we've heard, or even seen.   Director Speilberg at the time was, however, criticized as unrealistic for having included a mile wide tornado with unheard of ferocity. Then, the following year, the Midwest encountered a horrifically similar one - proving again that writer Crichton and Speilberg together had an uncanny sense of what is possible.   If you haven't seen this movie - do. Dispersed between heart pumping action scenes are humor lines that have become classics ... \\"I gotta go.. we've got COWS!\\"   Men will love the ongoing chase scenes and testosterone war between Bill & Jonah... \\"He's not in it for the science. He's in it for the MONEY!\\"  Women will be doubly entertained because there is actually a great unfolding of charachter development and emotional content beyond the typical crash and burn scenarios usually exclusive to action movies.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Awesome concept and a really great cd. This really is world music. I think Bob Marley would definitely approve!
B00288KNJU|5.0|The Movie:    Let me just state that although I am an adult, I absolutely loved this movie, and think that it would be perfect for everyone of all ages. Director Henry Selick of The Nightmare Before Christmas fame and the incredibly talented crew at LAIKA have painstakingly crafted a beautiful world using stop-motion animation. You have to see it to believe how life-like and expressive these characters are while still keeping the colorful fantasy like qualities of a fairytale animation.     I think one of the reasons why the movie works so well is that even despite the wonderful medium it's been created in, the central story is something that everyone can relate to. For adults, it's about remembering what it was like to be growing up and their relationship to their own parents. For kids, it's about exploration, suspense, and maturing through courage. Watching the movie several times through also compelled me to go out and buy the original book by Neil Gaiman. Interesting as well and definitely worth a look if you're interested as the tale is spun somewhat differently. For those that have complained that the movie may be too frightening for young children, why not ask them their opinion first before assuming that they will be scared. The movie was obviously made for children, included two in the cast, and intended to be scary and fun for their age. Plus, that is a central theme in the story: for children to learn to overcome their fears.    Thank goodness, the creators didn't sell out by shoving a whole bunch of huge actors making \\"hip\\" or \\"edgy\\" jokes. This one is true to it's own story, and you will fall in love with each of the characters. Now that said, I should definitely mention that the entire voicing cast did a truly superb job: Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, John Hodgman (PC guy), Robert Bailey, Keith David, Jennifer Saunders, Carolyn Crawford, and finally Ian McShane who did the unforgetable- Mr. Bobinsky (said with a Russian accent). And the \\"acting\\" is really a two-part job as the stop-motion animators did a fantastic job in displaying the character's emotions and dialogue. You really do forget that your seeing only animated puppets and not living creatures.    The Collector's Edition Blu-Ray/DVD:    Outstanding buy! I highly encourage everyone (as I have with all my family and friends) to go pick this one up. The Collector's Edition is great and comes packed with very interesting behind-the-scenes and voicing sessions integrated into the Blu-Ray.     I bet a lot of people are probably wondering about the quality of the 3-D that is offered. The Collector's Edition comes with 6 green-magenta 3-D glasses. So obviously it will not be anywhere near as cool as what was presented in the theatres, but this should not deter you as this is the only way to display 3-D currently on TV's as the technology has to do with the projector not the data (there is talk that new 3-D TV's will be made for the future but this probably won't be available for several years to come).     Personally, I thought this was an outstanding bonus and I will shamefully admit that this was what made me interested in purchasing the Blu-ray (Something I have never done before- bought a movie before actually seeing it beforehand. Somehow, I never really knew or forgot about it when it was in theatres- too bad, missed my chance. Though I truly hope it will return to theatres for it's original 3-D as I'll definitely make it this time!).     Anyways, you should definitely watch the 2-D movie first with it's brilliant colors and subtle details. Then try it out a second time with the 3-D glasses- it's quite neat. Although most of the color is gone with this type of 3-D, some are still present which is actually used to accentuate certain things like Coraline's yellow rain coat! I should mention that some people have complained about getting headaches from using the glasses, but I actually got used to it. And it does work- pretty cool stuff. In fact, I hope thisencourages other animated movies to include this feature. It's way too long to have to wait before 3-D TV's are released and even more before they become affordable!
B002GY9F9K|2.0|I feel like I almost have to write two reviews for this series, one for the series itself, and one for the series as a adaptation of the Sword of Truth book series by Terry Goodkind. One of those reviews will be favorable, one not so much.<br /><br />If I was to look at this series just as a swords and sorcery science fiction show then I would be amazed. The storyline is rather good, and it works well for it's episode by episode basis, with each episode being a story in itself, but belonging to a larger story that run through the entire season. The acting are decent, the special effects are not bad. Some have complained that she show is full of clich&eacute; characters and situations, and that is true, but I for one do not think that something being clich&eacute; automatically means that it is bad. Yes you have the pretty magic wielding heroine, the pheasant boy who discover a great destiny and a wise elderly wizard fighting a evil overlord with black hair, magic powers and red robes. Yes we have seen all this before, but there is a reason why this is imagery which have become so clich&eacute;, it works.<br /><br />The storyline is rather basic, Richard a simple woodsman meet Kahlan a woman with a strange magical ability that allow her to take control of people's minds, it turns out he is the Seeker, a sort of hero that show up every few generations to help the world when it is in great need and he joins Kahlan and the wizard Zedd on a quest to defeat Lord Rahl, a evil overlord that want to take over the whole world. But even if every fantasy fan have heard versions of this story before, it works well, the show is entertaining, and I find myself looking forward to next week and next episode when I see it. If I was to give this show a rating based on on itself, then I would give it four stars.<br /><br />However I also have to look at this as an long time fan of the Sword of Truth book series, and I have to tell you. I am extremely disappointed. The series sort of follows the event of the first book, Wizard's First Rule, and let me stress sort of. But it mess it up completely. Now I realize that one sometimes have to change a bit to a concept from a book to make it work on film, but seriously, they have just picked a few things to keep and went bananas with the rest. Let me make some examples of what I mean. The Confessors power. In the series it is made far more family friendly. The victims become like love sick puppies, and the Confessor can just ask the person afterwards to go and live a productive life. In the book however the Confessors power was such that it would completely destroy the mind of the victim, they could not go and live a productive life for they would no longer be able to make any decisions for them self, it is not just mind control, a way to prevent them from being able to disobey the Confessor, it destroys their minds. Other examples. Mord'sith are completely changed, in the books they took control of the powers of a magic user, and then they had him or her in their grip, in the series they only reflect the magic. As in Wizard toss fireball at Mord'sith, she just toss it back. The whole storyline with Richard and Denna is just gone, or rather it is there but so twisted it is just an insult to the original storyline. The ending is just destroyed. The ending of Wizard's First Rule is amazing, it is romantic, well done and keep you at the edge of your seat. In the TV series it is exchanged for some s@@@@ about time travel. Even that Richard can not be harmed by Kahlan's power in the books, because he already love her so much that his love protect him is just gone.<br /><br />Other things that are missing is the look of the setting. In the books it is a big point that in the Midlands women have hair length according to social status, this is just gone. Could it have cost so much to have actresses with short hair play maids and servants? It seams to me that allot of things are just changed out of carelessness,not out of having to change this to make it work on film. It makes me wonder if the director have even read the Sword of Truth books.<br /><br />I could go on an on and list all the things that are changed in the TV series, but it would be more easy to list what is the same. Legend of the Seeker have as much to do with Sword of Truth as Disney's The Little Mermaid have with the original fairytale. It has become a glossy, family friendly travesty.<br /><br />If you like swords and sorcery TV series, then you will like this series. If you are a Sword of Truth fan and long to see the world you love come to life on your TV then you will wish to bang your head violently against a table. This is not Sword of Truth, period.n film.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|While I was waiting for this to arrive, I must admit I was apprehensive. Early reviews suggested her voice had 'gone' so it was a pleasant surprise to discover (to my ears, at least) that she actually sounded pretty good.<br /><br />It's unlikely, of course, that this CD will scale the heights of her first couple of albums. As I write, 'I Look To You' and the new single, the Alicia Keys penned 'Million Dollar Bill', have received little airplay and it seems that where Whitney once stood, now stands Beyonce...<br /><br />Make no mistake, in these days of constant technical changes and advances, radio still rules. You can do Oprah, Letterman and any amount of TV promotion you like. The sales will improve for that week only. For a long-running hit album, you need radio to play it constantly.<br /><br />This doesn't mean this CD doesn't warrant plenty of airplay. It's pretty much classic Whitney, really, covering all the styles she's made her own over the years. Both aforementioned singles deserve to be hits. The low register demanded of 'I Look To You' perhaps led people to believe Whitney was struggling with the song but she does a sterling job on it, living every word. 'Salute' is even better, a driving anthem that leaves the best for last.<br /><br />'Call You Tonight' and the Diane Warren written 'I Didn't Know My Own Strength' are classy ballads and her duet with Akon, 'Like I Never Left' is cool contemporary stuff. I got a little confused with 'Worth It' and 'For The Lovers'. Both feature the phrase 'for the lovers' repeatedly leading me unable to tell which song was called what! For the record, 'For The Lovers' is the better track for me.<br /><br />One gripe is the inclusion of 'A Song For You'. What is it with this song lately? Ever since Michael Buble's ghastly version of it a few years ago, everyone seems to be doing cod-jazz takes on it. Whitney's rendition starts out jazzy but oddly turns into a pulsating disco number. It has to be said that Whitney over-sings horribly here (something she's still prone to whenever the mood takes her) and no-one could ever match the Carpenters version anyway so leave it alone!<br /><br />One more good thing about 'I Look To You' is that at 11 songs and running just over 44 minutes, it doesn't outstay it's welcome. I don't know about you but my heart sinks whenever I get an album by a favourite artist, flip it over and see that there are upwards of 17 songs on it...<br /><br />So, in conclusion, is 'I Look To You' the classic return to form promised? Well, not quite, there are still a few unremarkable tracks on it, but if you put her mega-sellers out of your mind and don't expect the same, it's a good effort and is well worth purchasing for any Whitney fan.<br /><br />I'm sure the album will debut at #1 this week but if radio doesn't embrace it, I doubt it will be in the top 100 in 2 months time, which is a shame.l prone to whenever the mood takes her) and no-one could ever match the Carpenters version anyway so leave it alone!

B000002J29|2.0|I wanted to purchase this album for enjoying Genesis while driving (having the good old LP's) but as for other Genesis so-called \\"definitive remastered edition\\" I am very disapointed with the \\"flatening\\" effect of the end result : all guitars from Steve Hackett that are usually so crystal-clear and play like watermarks over Tony Banks keyboards are \\"drowned\\" into a melting pot and even the famous drums solo duo looks like an anemic copy of the first recording.<br /><br />Too bad as well that the CD cover inlay does not include more infos, or a small booklet to give more infos for the \\"definitive edition\\" : in fact there are less than the original album (some pictures have been thrown away)<br /><br />My advise : this album is great, but aim for the non final mix edition or better catch the LP's if you can

B00005JLWN|3.0|Since this movie had so many rave reviews and quite a few friends of mine were telling me about how awesome it is, I decided to rent this movie because, for one, I love Christian Bale. I became a fan after seeing him in Newsies, which, while being a so-so movie at best, was worth it for Bale alone. Who thought he could sing very well? He was also in American Psycho, and a few other movies that I love. ALso, I love action movies, I'm a huge fan of dystopian stories and It seemed very matrix-ish.<br /><br />Let's get right down to the good: The action scenes are incredible. Some of the best I've seen in any movie. In fact, they alone save the movie from being downright awful. The action at the end was awesome too, and it was well shot and edited. No shaky camera, no rapid edits, the viewer can tell what's going on in the scenes. Also, no speed ups or slow motion, it's raw and down to earth. As for the visuals- the movie was shot on a very low budget, but even then they look great. The dystopian look really enhances the dark tones of the movie. Bale gives a great performance here, this is one of his better performances.<br /><br />However, that can't save the movie from being confusing and disjointed. The plot is really hard to follow. I had no idea what was going on, and at times it tried to echo The Matrix. Part of the reason The Matrix kicks serious ass is because the way it was done was incredible- when I watched the Matrix for the first time I was blown away, and I had not seen a movie like it. In fact, maybe had I not seen The Matrix before seeing Equilibrium, I might have liked Equilibrium more. Also, as much as I love the action scenes, at the same time I was wondering how it was possible that Bale's character had God like powers. The Matrix's scenes were more realistic in the sense that you knew why Neo had these godlike powers. Equilibrium offers no explanation, instead we're left wondering what the reasoning behind all of this is.<br /><br />Another negative point is the characters. None of the characters seemed to catch my attention at all. I personally couldn't care less if Bale died or not, and are we really supposed to feel sorry for Watson's character? I was just glad I didn't have to watch her anymore. As for Bale's character's kids, they were pointless and were out of place with the plot. Especially the son. In fact, when I saw that he was dressed like Bale, I laughed out loud. As for his acting, he sounded like he was reading off a teleprompter. Most of his dialogue was just him giving plot points away.<br /><br />In short, this movie is really a mixed bag. When it's good, it's good, but when it's bad, it's downright awful..

B00260HH3K|5.0|First and foremost, we all must agree that the Dragonball universe is not for the Oscars or any kind of serious review from critics.  Also, how well could they have made a movie like this?    At first, I was shocked and appalled by the opening scenes.  But, for a movie based off a crazy cartoon, all the characters ended up making sense to me as they actually hit all the right notes.      I'VE NEVER SEEN JAPANIMATION CROSS OVER AS WELL AS THESE GUYS PULLED IT OFF!!!  Especially Chow Yun-Fat - As Master Roshi, he hits his mark in most every scene.  Piccolo looks a bit weird, but I have to support this movie because of the series potential; I mean, these guys really did a great job and the idea of seeing Goku finally power up, live action, on-screen just gives me goosebumps.    Give it a try!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood has never been better.  His talent as an actor and director is obvious in this well done movie about racism, the impact of gangs on people, and the challenges that immigants face.
B00168OINK|5.0|Most of the elements of this movie are done well, with one piece done REALLY well.  The storyline is frankly a little bland - Panda, working in dad's noodle shop, dreams of being a Kung-fu master.  When prophesy says that the more-or-less villainous Tai-Lung may escape from prison, Master Oogway decides to appoint a \\"Dragon Warrior\\" from amongst \\"The Five\\" masters:  Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Mantis (as in, praying), and Viper.  Inevitably Panda gets in the way of Oogway's pointing finger, and we follow Panda's journey in Kung Fu land.    The storyline may not be noteworthy but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it.  Panda (Jack Black) and his Kung-Fu teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) lead the movie and each are outstanding.  When the mysticism of Kung Fu begins to soar a little out of bounds, Black's blue-collar approach to Panda brings it back down to earth.  Panda, a slobbering fan of \\"The Five\\", is overwhelmed simply to be in their presence (\\"You're all much bigger than your action figures.  Except for you, Master Mantis\\").  The dialogue is well written and very funny and entertaining.    Where this movie shines is in the visuals.  For some inexplicable reason, Dreamworks just pulled out ALL the stops on the animation work and this movie is simply gorgeous.  The colors are beautiful, the mountain scenery is stunning, the stars at night, the fog, sunrise, etc etc...    The animation peaks in the rendering of Tai Lung, the sort-of villain.  Tai Lung is depicted as an utterly magnificent snow leopard, and when he's on-screen in all his massive glory he simply OWNS the movie.  His escape from the inescapable prison is by far the most exciting action scene in the movie, too bad it comes near the beginning.  I can't help but wish they'd build an entire movie solely around this magnificent creature (it's hard to even mention him without using the word \\"magnificent\\").      If you own a 19-inch 4:3 television, you may find this movie entertaining at most.  If you'refortunate to have a full home theater setup with blu-ray you'll be stunned.  The third or fourth time you watch it you may even be tempted to turn the sound down, pop in some head music instead, and just soar with the visuals.  I only wish this movie were a painting so I could hang it on my wall.
B0015AARJI|5.0|My PS3 only came with one controller and this is an excellent second controller.  Worked right off the bat, no hassles.  I highly recommend.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is my first Sarah McLachlan album but it's most unlikely to be my last. Sarah has selected some familiar classics, singing them straight with one exception, together with some less familiar songs and one self-penned song, that being the title track.<br /><br />The set opens with a cover of John Lennon's classic song, Happy Xmas war is over. There was a time when I didn't come across covers of this song but it is definitely on<br />its way to becoming a Christmas standard, judging by the frequency with which I now come across covers. Maybe that's a reflection of the troubled world in which we live, where war seems never-ending. Actually, history shows that it was ever thus, but the modern media mean that we are more aware of faraway wars than our ancestors were in centuries past.<br /><br />Another song that is fast becoming a Christmas standard after a slow start is Joni Mitchell's River. More established standards to be found here are I'll be home for Christmas, O little town of Bethlehem, Silent night and Have yourself a merry little Christmas, all of them with familiar arrangements. Sarah also sings a superb version of In the bleak midwinter, one of my favorite carols but less frequently found on Christmas albums than the other established standards. The medley of First Noel and Mary Mary is an unexpected surprise, as Sarah has arranged it in her own way, which is noticeably different from the traditional arrangement of these songs.<br /><br />The title track is a superb ballad. Sarah also revives Song for a winter's night (a Gordon Lightfoot song) and Christmas time is here (which also appears on Skaggs family Christmas, though I've heard it elsewhere).<br /><br />This mellow Christmas album is definitely not party music, but you can enjoy it in the quieter moments around Christmas.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I have always loved Playstation. I think the DS controllers fit in my hands well, and this one is no different. I like the added bit of weight; it feels a bit less cheap. However, they didn't seem to improve on the design at all. Now, i'm not an xbox person. I find that controller too big. But some things could be incorporated into the DS controller. After hours of play my thumbs tend to slip on the joysticks and it would be nice if the R2 and L2 had a concave surface like the xbox ones do. The one big thing I was shocked to find is the lack of a cord. Why must I go buy another cord when I'm buying a controller for $45?? Yes, I got one with the system. Anyone who yelps about that obviously isn't the type of gamer I am. I find it silly that after a night of playing with my friends I must charge the controllers one at a time off the system's included cord. I find my friends switching controllers with whoever is closest to the system so they can charge the battery on a controller while we play. What garbage! I went out and bought a cord to alleviate this problem. You don't see Microsoft making this mistake. Perhaps that's why the PS3 is doing so poorly.
B000244FDW|5.0|This is the best film ever of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, and to see it sharp and clear in a re-mastered DVD was an absolute joy.  First saw this version, produced by the BBC, on Masterpiece Theater in 1980. The more recent and forgettable A&E version, Colin Firth not withstanding, dumbed down Jane Austen's language unforgivably and featured actresses so buffed, they practically burst out of their Empire organdy frocks. The old MGM film with Greer Garson was appalling. Setting of the Keira Knightley film might have been more accurate, but that overall production doesn't compare with the BBC's.  Fay Weldon, noted British author, dramatized the novel in five parts. Weldon was so skillful she could distill the essence of Jane Austen's wry observations without diminishing them. The rhythm and speech patterns of the novel have been translated beautifully to the screen.  It's as if Jane had a really good editor.  Acting is topnotch. Judy Parfit's Lady Katharine even better than Judi Dench's! Mr. Collins, Darcy, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Bennett, all are perfection. Elizabeth, the sisters, dastardly Wickham, Bennett aunt/uncle most excellent.

B001AQTWF2|1.0|I say this is Whitney still on drugs!!! I was very disappointed with this album. I liked one song on the whole album. I was a great fan of Whitney until she went overboard on drugs, such a waist of talent!! I only wish her the best.
B00284BMBM|5.0|This second CD by Daughtry proves once again why he should have actually WON American Idol.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I was absolutely transfixed with this film! A vampire tale like no other! None of the mind-numbing, loud music, explosions, obligatory soft-core sex scenes and predictable formulaic nonsense producers churn out these days! This film is refreshingly different!<br /><br />A story of two children who have difficult lives and find each other. As oppressed children will do, they bond through the crucible of shared pain and lonliness.<br /><br />Oskar is a lonely, depressed 12 year old boy in a single-parent household. Bullied at school, he fantacizes about killing his oppressors. Eli is a young girl who has moved in next door. They meet under strange cicumstances and connect as children do with simple acceptance.<br /><br />Soon, Oskar notices he only sees his new friend only at night. She doesn't go to school, is usually barefoot and wearing only short sleeved shirts outside at night even though it is in the dead of winter in Sweden and she, \\"Smells funny\\".<br /><br />There are many quiet, intimate moments as these two children grow closer. There is a lot of communication between the two without words as children often do with one another. The simplicity of such moments projects a profound complexity of communion between the two through shared understanding and sensitivity.<br /><br />It is a wonderful, touching story as each character temporarily escapes the painful, loneliness of their own lives with the shared companionship of the other. As trust builds between the two, they share a profound intimacy that seems to transcend the normal closeness between two people. They soon come to rely on one another more and more as time goes on.<br /><br />However, as Oskar begins to feel the normal burgeoniongs of sexual awakening as an adolescent boy, he is shocked and astonished with the reality that the girl he has grown so close to, is a powerful, savage predator, capable of unspeakable violence!<br /><br />The film has a thoughtful, intimate tone and draws you in as you are reminded of the precepts of vampire legend and lore. You are witness to their time together and the difficult circumstances they must cope with while apart.<br /><br />The film builds to a shocking and interesting ending that is neither gratuitous nor expected.  I highly recommend this film to anyone!. You are witness to their time together and the difficult circumstances they must cope with while apart.     The film builds to a shocking and interesting ending that is neither gratuitous nor expected.  I highly recommend this film to anyone!
B001LMT50W|5.0|Before purchasing this album, I had doubts whether the tracks were worth listening to and after hearing first-hand how bad X&Y was, I was justified in having second thoughts about buying it. After hearing that the album had dropped down to $5 for a limited time, I decided to buy it and experience it first-hand. What I experienced was an almost perfect album. I have to admit that it does stray from their earlier albums like \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" but not being a hardcore Coldplay listener, I welcomed the change. Songs like \\"Lost!\\", \\"42\\", \\"Lovers in Japan\\" to name a few showcase Coldplay's new and welcomed direction where they expirement with various styles. Not to mention all the songs are extremely catchy and they will be stuck in your head for days. Here are some of my comments on the songs:    Life in Technicolor - 4/5; Short but sweet  Cemeteries of London - 4/5   Lost! - 5/5; Catchy  42 - 5/5   Lovers in Japan - 5/5; One of my favorites, awesome lyrics  Yes - 5/5; Also my favorite, features Martin singing looow, middle eastern section  Viva La Vida - 5/5; Amazing of course  Violet Hill - 4/5; Love the guitar solo  Strawberry Swing - 2/5; Okay, could have been left out  Death And All His Friends - 5/5; Great ending to a great album    Disc 2 is also awesome. I don't have time to comment on each song but make sure you buy the Prospekt's March edition! Why some of them were left out of Disc 1 is suprising really.    In summary, buy the album for you and 10 of your friends. It's that good.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I wasn't much of a trekkie before I bought this, but I am a true believer now! With the improved picture, improved sound, and new special effects, this will help bring in those who shunned Star Trek previously. The picture quality is spectacular, and I have been extremely impressed with the clarity of the sound. The new special effects also help eliminate some of the show's cheesiness. Star Trek is a great series, and this is easily one of the best blu-ray releases thus far. If you're sitting on the fence on this one, and you're wondering if it's worth the money, it definitely is. I can't wait for season 2 and 3!
B0010X745K|1.0|All I can say is that I gave this a chance, but ended up hating it.  The ending sealed the deal.  The movie was flat, the characters just too plain dumb, and the attempt at social commentary wasted.  I can't even recommend this as a time kill B Movie.  Sorry.  It started out with some potential and went downhill within minutes...
0316001821|5.0|This was much more than the typical, modern, fictional page-turner, for me. It was obvious the author took care to make the book as colloquial as possible; she saved the \\"poetry\\" for the emotional, insightful content & subject matter. As another reviewer intimated, this book calls to mind, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird;\\" and I actually preferred this contemporary cousin, due to it's expanded, spiritual scope.    Sebold absolutely nails the early/mid 70's teenage experience, to boot; which should give extra incentive, for those who grew up around that time period, to partake in this retro joy-ride. Irregardless, this classic should be a joy for ages 8 to 80; and revelatory for those who give it the time & attention to read between the carefully crafted story-telling.     A relevant work that will still be read, and relevant, 50 years from now... and beyond.

B0019X3YXM|3.0|It's a campy movie but fun to watch especially with a pretty girl by your side. If you enjoy movies for their entertainment value and not because it's dramatic or realistic, then you'll like this movie. I bought it because I too, have a sassy girl and so much of it reminds me of her.
B000FA675C|5.0|Not that this tome needs more praise, but the above is true. It took her mind far from the dreary hours of chemo and leaving 5 yr old twins behind to dream of Magdn and Jesus. We are both Catholics and adored this work. She tried to hold out for the movie but missed it by one day. We say she saw it as the in-flight movie on her plane to heaven. Some works bring entertainment and mystery to life. This one I will hold dear eternally.
B00006F1LX|5.0|Pulp Fiction easily has one of the greatest soundtracks when it comes to movies,  (although the songs admittedly gain more meaning automatically when used in the context of his movies) and rightly so.  Like the movie itself, it's a glorious, concise joyride, full of surf guitar, country, passion, and whatever have you.  Indeed, these songs are easily full of meaning because they are actually used in context of these movies, and with snippets of dialogue scattered about, well, what else can a Tarantino lover ask for?  Here's my individual thoughts on each song.<br /><br />1.  Misirlou-Starting out with the energetic dialogue before the hold up that rips right into scorching riffs.  Its strong exotic flavor never wanes and the song will make you jump out and air guitar, as well as dance with your body like crazy.<br />2.  Royale With Cheese-the famous Royale with Cheese bit, though it gets old if you listen to too much.  I've heard this one too many times, though.<br />3.  Jungle Boogie- Raunchy, in your-face, this is the soundtrack to Pulp Fiction's most scorching moments.<br />4.  Let's Stay Together-The classy, brassy intro, will make you always imagine the title card in the movie, then the movie's somehow timeless, poignant feel is reflected in this The song itself is soulful Al Green, whatever than means.<br />5.  Bustin Surfboards-This bright and sunny surf guitar classic is nostalgic, punctured by an extremely raw feel to it.  Played during the drug dealing scene.<br />6.  Lonesome Town-This great song, performed by Ricky Nelson, is an ode to loneliness.  Somber and concise as well, and it doesn't stick around enough to get on your nerves<br />7.  Son of A Preacher Man-Yeah!  Who doesn't remember this stylish, super-cool, chill song.  Makes you want to pour a couple glasses of wine, kick it with a beautiful woman, and smoke all night long.  Or spend a date with the classy Uma Thurman.  Either one works.<br />8.  Bullwinkle Part 2-After a snippet of Zed's dead, this dark, spaghetti western surf song makes you feel high and ready for crusing down the highway.  Great solos from the sax and guitar<br />9.  You can Never Tell-This song just rules.  This infectious, rockabilly tune will you have dancing the twist along with Mia and Vincent in no time.<br />10.  Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon-This breathtaking song is atmospheric for a top 40 tune.  It's the kind of song that perfectly captures a sunset ride in the painted  desert or dream  beach.  You'll be strumming the guitar notes in this song and dancing along like Uma in no time flat.<br />11.  If Love is a Red Dress-Alright, I wasn't a big fan of this song, but this country song is legit made and sounds rustic the way country should be.<br />12.  Bring Out the Gimp-This song kind of does capture the crazy and  somewhat haunting motives of Zed and Maynard, but it's raunchy, crazy jazz, with a wildly entertaing rhythm, guitars, and instruments.  You'll air drum the song in no time.<br />13.  Flowers On the Wall-This country romp from the guys who brought us Bred of Roses is perhaps the best non-known song on here.  It's chorus is stomping and catchy beyond belief.<br />14.  Personality Goes A Long Way-kind of weak without facial expressions, but I'm not really going to complain here.<br />15.  Surf Rider-A conclusive, brilliantly infectious piece of surf work.  In the movie, this makes the credits worth watching, simply bcause you get to jam for a pretty extended amount of time.<br />16.

Strawberry Letter 22-This song is heard very quietly and briefly when Jules and Vincent are passing some apartments on their way to the hit.  Used more in Jackie Brown, however, but it's still a great tune.<br />20.  Out of Limits-Gets a bit irritating, but some great surf riffs in the build-up make the songs worth listening.<br /><br />This re-issue (ignore the Collector's Edition tag) is remastered, and while I don't own the original soundtrack, the soundtrack sounds loud, clear, and bright, just excellently made.

B001G9LVGG|4.0|I have enjoyed her music for years, and this CD doesn't loose any of the special nuances of her vocal range.  Could not wait until Christms to listen to it, and then again it will also be enjoyed when Christmas is here again.

B000002549|5.0|It's not often I get to use the phrase \\"sui generis\\" -- fancy talk for \\"unique\\" -- but this album truly is a genre unto itself ... and to Streisand, to classical music, to new age sounds.<br /><br />In the 1970s, Streisand took on all challenges: Bowie? Check. Post-Beatles John Lennon? Check. Disco? Check. Hard guitar pop? Check. Voice & piano? Check. In an amazing ten-year period, Streisand pushed her beautiful voice in every musical direction to see what she could do outside of the show tunes and quirky cabaret music that defined her 1960s output. So \\"going classical\\" was just par for the course of that decade.<br /><br />Classical purists hated this album. Streisand lovers hated this album. Everyone suspected -- as with the equally wonderful 1966 \\"[[ASIN:B0012GMZ4U Je M'appelle Barbra]]\\" album -- that it would flop. And it did. However, listening to this album 35 years later, commercial considerations are irrelevant. Streisand always said she brought her acting chops to songs and created characters for each number. Most of these songs originated in opera. Doesn't it make sense that she would be drawn to -- and know what to do with -- classical material?<br /><br />The arrangements here are unfailingly lovely and border on the edge of \\"new age\\" -- and I mean that as a compliment. Think about the best moments of a Win Mertens or a Michael Manring on Windham Hill -- not a John Tesch or \\"Hearts in Space\\" treacly misstep -- and you'll get the idea of what I mean.<br /><br />Her singing here is also uniformly restrained. She has nothing to prove, which ironically proves just how good she is when she jettisons irony (her standard '60s mode) for intimacy and tenderness.<br /><br />Her takes on Debussy's \\"Beau Soir\\" and Faur&eacute;'s \\"Pavane\\" are flat-out beautiful. Coming close are Wolf's \\"Verschwiegene Liebe\\" and Claus Ogermann's adaptation of  Pushkin's \\"I Loved You\\" (a rare time when Pushkin also wasn't being ironic.)<br /><br />If you leave your expectations aside and think of this album as a set of ten of the best-written songs Streisand ever sang --  and sang with out the occasionally overwrought belting or too-coy comic moments -- you'll be surprised at first and, eventually, as pleased as you are with an excellent red wine that leaves a warm, warm glow.ritten songs Streisand ever sang --  and sang with out the occasionally overwrought belting or too-coy comic moments -- you'll be surprised at first and, eventually, as pleased as you are with an excellent red wine that leaves a warm, warm glow.
B000001EL7|4.0|kiss released love gun in the summer of 1977.that year kiss mania was in full swing.kiss,s live show that year was also amazing. i think love gun is one of the top ten best kiss albums ever.one of the great things about kiss,s music is that it is fairly simple but very entertaining!!unfortuneately this is the last effort in the 70,s that all the original members played on as a group effort.by the dynasty album in 1979 peter criss was losing interest in kiss and did not play drums on the dynasty album.that being said, love gun was a pretty solid record.i think the great cuts are;shock me,christine sixteen,tommorow and tonight,love gun,plaster caster,hooligan and almost human!!kiss also had great album covers and love gun is one of the best!!!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Gritty, ugly and utterly compelling, Generation Kill stands apart from many war offerings by refusing to gild the lily or indulge in rank patriotism. Its characters are not immediately likeable but as you share their experience as the \\"tippety-tip of the spear\\" during the Iraq war, they grow on you.  There is no message in this series, no pro or anti stance on the invasion, just a warts and all insight into what the marines went through. Just how some of their commanding officers reacted to the series would be interesting to know - they were hardly portrayed in a good light.   Sound effects and cinematic tension were superb: at times it felt like you were there, making watching the series an exhausting undertaking.   This is a must-view for anyone interested in the most controversial US military adventure since Vietnam.
0385736002|5.0|At last a worthy sucessor to the crown of Potter. 'Alchemyst' succeeds on almost every level. Immediately compelling plot, fun characters, and no too many that you find yourself lost in who's who, and an original twist on the fight of good versus evil. Fifteen year old twins Sophie and Josh find them selves at the middle of a tempest, when a friend of theirs, Nicholas Flamel, is under attack from an old student of his named Dee, who has aligned with the dark side, and wanss a magical book Flamel has. The book holds the key to the potential destruction of the world, as well as a spell that keeps Flamel and his wife forever young.Without it, they begin to age at the rate of a year a day. Soon the twins learn that they two are contained within the magical pages, as the pure ones who will bring either triumph or destruction upon the world.The book is fast paced and exciting, with the only blip in the narrative being why wouldn't Flamel just have memorized the spell after doing it for literally thousands of years? Otherwise a fun novel for all ages and not just the 6-9th grade it's geared towards.
B00005ASGG|5.0|For me, this film is the greatest western of all. Now, that's a matter of individual taste, and yours may be different. But the themes of justice, deception, good and evil, grief and loss, mourning the past and looking to a new future are all so well balanced that nothing else has been able to knock this off the top spot in the genre for me.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is Ransom Stoddard, a young idealist lawyer arriving in the lawless town of Shinbone in the old west, where if you want justice you had better claim it for yourself through skill with a gun. He immediately runs afoul of Liberty Valance (spectacularly played by Lee Marvin), the worst of the local outlaws, and indirectly befriends Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), who by chance also aspires, like Ransom, to get the girl in the picture, Hallie (Vera Miles).<br /><br />Eventually Liberty Valance calls Rance out for a gunfight in the street, which is the pivotal event in the movie. After all, it's called \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" for a reason! But believe me, the gunfight isn't the end of the film.<br /><br />There is a strong theme of the \\"common man\\" vs. the rich and powerful. The story is set in the context of deciding whether the local territory (which remains unnamed, but could be something like an Arizona, Nevada or New Mexico) should remain a territory or become a state in the union. The local ranchers are against statehood, because they want to continue using public lands for free to graze and water their cattle. They hire outlaws like Liberty Valance to intimidate the local populace and threaten that terrible things will happen to them if they vote in favor of statehood.<br /><br />John Ford hits all the right notes. Good triumphs over evil, but at a tremendous personal cost. The territory marches inevitably to statehood, bringing new progress to Shinbone but killing its former, freer way of life. Jimmy Stewart's character does tremendous good, but must live a lie to do so. Terrific!

Many have criticized Joel for not having a more creative musical vision, but the arrangements and instrumental diversity on this album are outstanding.  Joel has a tremendous talent at seizing an audience's attention and tapping into their soul.  His songwriting, lyrics, piano virtuosity, and honesty have made him an american and world treasure.
B000001ELL|4.0|by the time kiss released dynasty in 1979 the band had achieved household status commercial success on almost every level.the love gun tour of 77-78 was one of the top money making tours of the times. then came 1978 when the band took a temporary break,each band member recorded a solo album. so fast forward to early 1979 the band regrouped and started work on a follow up to love gun.unfortuneately peter criss seemed to be losing interest in kiss and had a fairly limited participation in the dynasty sessions. so kiss got session drummmer anton fig who had played on ace,s solo album. despite  peter criss,s loss of interest in the band and the dynasty project, the band mananged to record a fairly good album.for me the best cuts are;2000 man[a stones tune from 1967 chosen by ace frehley and done very well!!],i was made for loving you,sure know something,magic touch,dirty livin and ex-ray eyes.this album is worth buying. the dynasty tour was the last for peter criss, he left the band after this tour until the reunion in 1996.
0307266303|5.0|I didn't think I'd like this book because I'm not that interested in running, but I enjoyed it immensely.  All of the people described in the book were so interesting that it almost seems more fictional than real.  McDougall does a great job with the writing and keeping things entertaining and fast-paced.  I read this one in two or three days like I usually read a good thriller, and I was sorry that it ended.  I highly recommend this for anyone including those not interested in reading about running!
B0010X745K|3.0|For a monster movie, this is a great film.<br /><br />The premise is simple, a mist (that spawns all types of monsters) surrounds a supermarket, trapping patrons inside. When somebody goes outside, they get killed in gruesome fashion. While it may appear that there is safety inside, since it is a grocey store , with big plate-glass windows, it is just a matter of time before the monsters get in. What I just described is your basic silly monster movie. The premise is ridiculous and it is unimportant what caused this phenomenon.<br /><br />What makes this movie good, is that the focus is on how the people inside of the grocery store try to cope with each other. There is betrayal, hysteria, allegiances and other relationships which actually is the primary focus of the film. There is a pragmatic and doting father with his son, a crazy religous zealot, mindless small-town yahoos, a pompous lawyer and other representatives of opposite polarities which make the human survivors much more monstrous towards each other than the dinosaur/monsters lurking outside. Like George Romero from \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", some of the melodramatic conflict is a metaphor for real life issues like racism, religous fanaticism, zenophobia and desperation.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT. The main knock on this movie is the extremely dark and downer of an ending. The ending is not typical of a mainstream \\"happy ending\\". The ending is not stupid and it is consistent with the plot and progession of the characters. I think the ending is not appreciated because this was a cheesy monster movie with a real serious and emotional ending.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is better than 90% of horror movies out there.
0385341008|4.0|Unless you are a student of history you probably do not know that the Channel Islands were occupied by the Germans during WW11. This novel, written by two women [a niece with writing credentials supplemented her ill aunt's already begun story]tells the story of that occupation through letters written to and from people who lived on Guernsey. Some in our book club found it a bit difficult to get into the literary device of the letter form, but once into the story, all became absorbed in the tale. A romance -or two - is subtley woven into the narrative, along with the history of a love child between one of the islanders and one of the German soldiers. Reminscent of a PBS special of several  years back called Islands at War, this novel is a good tale well told.
0812971825|5.0|...I have read all of Elizabeth Strout's work, and I find it all excellent and worthwhile.  Her storytelling pulls you in and wraps you with the characters' feelings.  You will say to yourself that you know these people, and you won't be sure if that's a good or bad thing.
0156030209|4.0|This original tale's voice took a while to get used to, but I decided to settle into the pace and absorb the details. I think the ending almost undoes all that the author has patiently and carefully constructed, but that misstep is forgiveable. Great story well-told.
B0000UJL96|4.0|I liked all three movies but it wasn't until they got to \\"The search for Spock\\" that they got the editing right on the Star Trek movies.  Very intertaining though.
0596007124|5.0|One word, this book is COOL. Hats off to the authors for coming up with such an amazing work. This is certainly one of the most useful books I have read in a while. This book has made design patterns piece of cake. Design patterns were never so easy to learn before. I must say this book is a perfect start to learn design patterns. It includes all of the prominent patterns from the original GoF book and explain each pattern in great deal. The examples are well-chosen and make the learning process even more easy. Some time it feels repetitive but that is also with purpose. As the book explains in the very beginning, it helps our brain in absorbing the details. For the same reason emphasis has been put more on images than text, to make learning easy. The result is that you can understand a pattern quickly by following the images and don't have to go through lot of text every time.<br />Some of the patterns have been considered less important and are included in the appendix with two-page discussion per pattern. My only little complain is that it includes Bridge pattern too even though it is considered among the important patterns (discussed 3rd in Design Patterns Explained by Alan Shalloway, James Trott). Likewise, Visitor pattern is also included there (I think it is a fairly good pattern, or may be I think so because I have implemented it once)<br />Note that although it is a 600+ pages book but since it includes lots of images, exercises etc, it is actually like a 300 page book, it won't take you long to finish it.<br />In short, a wonderful book in all respects, go get it.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Okay -- everyone has talked about the shaky camera work, the monster movie aspect, the limited backstory and exposition, and that it might not be the most horrific horror movie ever, but I think that these commentaries miss the point.  What ultimately makes a movie work (or not), is whether we care about the characters, and Cloverfield succeeds because we root for Rob (played by Michael Stahl-David) to save and reunite with Beth (Odette Yustman), and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) and Hud (T.J. Rogers) provide enough wit, sarcasm, humor and reality to keep us grounded and  involved.  The conceit of the single camcorder gives the movie a reality Youtube feel that heightens the illusion that these are real people, not just actors.    The story in a nutshell is that a video has been recovered that shows what happens the night a horrific monster attacks New York.  It was supposed to be a testimonial tape for Rob as he prepares to go to Japan, and it was shot over a tape he made of a magical day he spent with Beth.  This way we get some of Rob and Beth's backstory at strategic intervals, we get introduced to the characters, and the horror story that unfolds is an accident of time and fate.    It feels like the moviemakers -- JJ Abrams produced it, Matt Rees directed --must have felt that the 1998 remake of Godzilla was a missed opportunity, because this feels like an extended commentary on that film.  Like that movie, we don't see the monster fully for most of the film.  Unlike that film, this story is not about the military, scientists, etc. trying to fight the monster (though they are certainly present), but how ordinary people might experience the night.  As such it is much more successful.    The jittery style may be tough to take at moments, but this is a film definitely worth seeing, and I think it will stick with you a little longer than the average horror movie because of the relationships at its heart.

0393325172|3.0|In most ways a simply lovely novel.  Naturally it will appeal to those who are carried away by the romance of square-rigged ships, or sea stories--and these will continue to be the most fanatical fans, perhaps.  But it's just a good novel, taken by any measure, gorgeously written, often very very funny, populated with such alive and rounded, real characters, and put together elegantly, like a crossword puzzle.  Of particular interest in the first novel is Dillon, the rather tortured First Lieutenant, and Aubrey himself.  Frankly, the novel pales besides the second novel, \\"Post Captain,\\" in which the canvas seems to explode with richness, with  O'Brian demonstrating really impressive technical skill, writing long, brilliant dialogue scenes reminiscent of Tolstoy in style while moving the complicated Stephen Maturin to the foreground.  But \\"Master and Commander\\" is an impressive start, and a charming introduction to the characters.
0312427999|5.0|Naomi Campbell's book is much more than I ever could have expected.  While not only a radical perspective compared to most americans economic views, the book provides a very interesting and little known history to light.  The book examines often the US and the role of multinational corporations and its role in toppling and inserting brutal free markets into countries in South America and how similar things have happened theoughout the world all through the last half of the twentieth century.    This book changed my life in many ways.  While not only giving me much better knowledge about free market problems, the book made me realize that freedom is great but making sure your neighbors and community are taken care of should be just as strong and important values and that  a certain american ideology doesnt allow for that.

031606792X|1.0|*Plenty of spoilers ahead*    I did not understand the appeal of the Twilight series (please note: series, NOT saga) throughout the first three books. Admittedly, the first book was almost decent, but the writing was so horrible that I couldn't imagine reading it more than once, let alone obsessively for months on end. New Moon showed just how truly pathetic a character Bella is, becoming a zombie for months on end because her precious boyfriend of several months left her (the clear message to the impressionable girls reading this tripe is that your happiness should depend solely on the boy you date), and it isn't until another potential love interest comes into the picture that Bella becomes herself again (which means young women can never get over a broken heart without another guy stepping up). Eclipse was rather trite, as it was obvious from the beginning that Bella would end up with Edward (anyone who truly expected her to be with Jacob has probably never read another book in their life), yet she \\"struggled\\" with the \\"love triangle\\" for hundreds of pages. We got a battle (FINALLY! Proof that the world of vampires is actually dangerous!) but Meyer loves her precious, one-dimensional characters too much to kill any of them, despite the fact that death is a part of life.    Breaking Dawn is more of the same in many ways, but even fans are outraged over the poor writing quality and ridiculous plotlines. Bella and Edward get married and have a honeymoon in which they consummate their marriage, and somehow Bella becomes pregnant with a vampire-human fetus. Meyer attempts to explain this scientifically, which is absolutely hilarious. Why you would attempt to explain something like vampires with science is beyond me. The demon spawn somehow grows at an alarming rate and wants human blood as nourishment, so Bella begins to drink blood from a sippy cup. Demon spawn is also so strong that a kick breaks Bella's ribs. This part of the novel is narrated by Jacob, which is animprovement over Bella, if only because he doesn't swoon over Edward every other sentence.     Then comes the birth scene. I won't get into horrible detail, but it is excruciating to read. It is gory, violent and flat-out disturbing. Demon spawn breaks Bella's spine, paralyzing her, and is delivered by c-section...with Edward tearing through Bella's uterus with his teeth. Edward injects his venom into Bella's heart and she becomes a vampire. Magically, she has an incredibly easy time adjusting to her new vampire senses and is able to stop herself from killing a human. This is all the more impressive when Carlisle tells her that he's never seen a vampire with as much self-control after so short a time in his hundreds of years of being a vampire. Meyer is so enamored with her precious Mary-Sue that she goes against everything she has talked about for hundreds of pages and makes Bella's transition to vampire extremely easy.     Jacob imprints on the newborn baby (named Renesmee and nicknamed Nessie, which I feel is appropriate for demon mutant spawn), which means they will eventually have a sexual relationship. While this might not be pedophilia in the typical sense (as he is not sexually attracted to her when she is an infant), it IS child grooming, meaning that he will have a part in her upbringing and will eventually have sex with her, as the whole point of imprinting is procreation, not romance. Disgusted? I was too.    Through a misunderstanding about Nessie, the Volturi show up with an army. The Cullens have over a month to prepare (suspenseful, right??) and round up some of their friends to be on their side. The werewolves are also on their side, as Jacob has imprinted on Nessie (who grows at a remarkable rate, being a toddler in a matter of days, etc. Somehow she will magically stop growing physically at around age 18, which is perfect for Jacob to be able to have sex with her for the rest of time...gag!). A huge showdown seems imminent, only to end with Bellaexplaining that Nessie is not a problem, and the Volturi go away. In other words, you get to read several hundred pages of Bella freaking out over a battle with her vampire/werewolf family only for it to come to nothing.    Meyer says she could never write an ending like Hamlet, in which almost all the characters die. I don't have a problem with this, but why on earth did she need to ramble on for hundreds of pages about this horribly dangerous event coming up only for it to end on such a ridiculous note? This book is way too long for the amount of plot it includes, and I find it hilarious that Meyer has said that she doesn't think Breaking Dawn could be made into a single movie. Very little happens for the book to be so long.     My main problem with this book is that every character gets exactly what they want without sacrificing anything. I don't have a problem with happy endings, but for Meyer to go on CONSTANTLY about how dangerous their world is and for nothing dangerous to happen is frustrating beyond belief. Bella knew when she decided to turn into a vampire that she would be giving up her family, Jacob, her human friends, her ability to have children, and a college career. She felt that becoming a vampire was worth everything she would be giving up, and made the decision. Then, because she can't stand seeing her character not get everything she wants, Meyer makes it so that Bella doesn't give up anything for her new life. She manages to have a baby whose existance makes no sense. She is able to have her father in her life (he's content with being on a need-to-know basis), and in all likelihood she will be able to have her mother in her life as well. She still has Jacob in her life as he imprinted on her daughter (gross). She has a lifetime to go to college and do whatever she wants. So basically, Meyer would rather go back on what she's been talking about for THREE WHOLE BOOKS in order for Bella to have a perfect life.     This shoddy writing is simply inexcusable, especially after publishing three other (however mediocre) books before it. This is not a first novel, so there is no excuse for the writing being so embarrassingly amateur. Every character getting exactly what they want without giving up anything is such a cop-out, it makes this book even worse than the rest. I wish I could give it zero stars, but alas, one is the lowest it goes.    I apologize for the long review, but it can be cathartic to vent some frustration on such a horrible series that is somehow mentioned in the same sentence as Harry Potter, a comparison that angers me beyond belief. JK Rowling can write, and is able to kill off loved characters in order to make her books believable. Stephenie Meyer cannot write, and would rather go back on everything she has said for thousands of pages than make her characters rounded and believable.
B00005KK4P|5.0|The me, this is clearly the best of the complete Schubert cycles available. That is in part due to the fact that Beecham never recorded No. 4 or No. 9, and also due to Bohm being a very understanding Schubertian. That being said, there are some other \\"must have\\" discs (according to your taste), even if you own this cycle. Those would be all of Beecham's - [[ASIN:B00006JNAH Sir Thomas Beecham Conducts Schubert]] and [[ASIN:B00000IOC2 Great Recordings Of The Century - Schubert: Symphonies nos. 3, 5, & 6 / Beecham, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Also, Furtwangler's great 8th & 9th: [[ASIN:B000001GQR Schubert: Symphony No. 9; Haydn: Symphony No. 88 / Furtw&auml;ngler]] and [[ASIN:B000026BF5 Brahms: Symphony No.3 / Schubert: Symphony No.8]]. But, if you just want a solid, well played complete set then this Bohm set (usually can be found for under $20 at amazon.com marketplace) is the ticket. 4 1/2 stars.

0312330537|5.0|Shantaram is a complete adventure. The reader will experience Bombay through all the senses. Brilliant charachertors that I found stuck with me. Based on the authors real life experience, at times I would wonder what was fiction and what was not. It is long, at times wordy and at times preachy and self righteous but worth the commitment to read. Like nothing I have read before. Enjoy the ride.
B00062ZE44|5.0|While the first album was a hit, it was fantastic, this one is better.    \\"Jillian\\", \\"Memory\\", \\"Stand My Ground\\", \\"Forsaken\\", \\"Angels\\", \\"It's the Fear\\", \\"See Who I Am\\"  ..Those songs drove Within Temptation to stardom, and they are powerful and beautiful songs.    I highly recommend this album.
B001R0KH3W|5.0|Having the opportunity to see and listen to Stevie Wonder in this high definition Bluray format is absolutely fantastic. You get to see a total array of talent, stemming from Stevie himself who is a genius as a composer, producer, arranger, performer to the band that acompanies him in the set during the concert. Song selection is beautiful, I only wish that the concert had included \\"Kiss Lonely Goodbye\\". A must have for Stevie Wonder fans.

0394405641|1.0|Be aware this is the drama version of the book, not the book itself. I was ordering based on reviews, but did not know it was a play version until I received it. If you enlarge the cover it is visible, but no where in the description Amazon gives. Disappointed as I ordered two copies through private sellers!
B001NFNFNU|3.0|'Changling' is another good film directed by Clint Eastwood, but it could have used a little editing. The story starts off a little slow and confusing, but gains momentum after the first third of the film. Despite having solid performances, there are none I will remember tomorrow. The film also suffers from having one ending after another in the last half an hour! It's a beautiful looking film that's a little frustrating at times, but is certainly worth seeing. This is not Clint's best work, but is impressive at times.
1595141715|5.0|My little sister (14 years old) reccommended this book after she bought it.  I was surprised by how much I liked it (I am 26).  I think it teaches valuable lessons on how our actions affect people regardless of age.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|This was an awesome show from beginning to end. Watching this dvd made me feel as if I we present in front row stage. Costumes were awesome, the dancers were awesome. It was worth every penny. If you are a Beyonce fan. Amazon is the way to go for affordable concert dvds. This same dvd was in best buy for $29.95. I paid a 3rd of the cost.Enjoy!

B002KS1IJC|4.0|I never noticed this movie if it ever went to the box office, and that's too bad, because it would have been enjoyable on the big screen.  If you enjoyed 13th Warrior and Lord of the Rings, it's filmed in a similar style, with similar pacing and action, but it's not quite at the level those movies achieved (though close).  It's much better than other movies that have tried to take on the Grendel story, and while there's a sci-fi twist to this one, it's not overplayed.  Of course there are those Hollywood hard-to-believe moments in it, but the special effects were well done, the acting was nice, and the story moved well and kept you guessing a bit as to how it would go.  It does deserve it's R-rating as it's a bit violent and bloody (which didn't really add much to the movie), but it didn't feel gratuitous.  Some bits of it felt borrowed, but this is one of those movies where you don't really care and enjoy the ride anyway because it was put together well.
B00288KNJU|4.0|I watched this movie with the 3D glasses that it comes with.... all I have to say this movie was great! So imaginative,creepy, beautiful, wonderful storytelling. I thought it had the right balance of dark where kids ages 8 to 13 would like it, other than that under 8 might find it a little scary. As a big movie fan and fanboy the animation was great, colors were vibrant where it needed and drab when needing to be drab. And watching it in 3D was a really cool. If you like Corpse Bride, Nightmare Before Christmas, beautiful imagery even if it is of animation kind then see this. Adults will enjoy it! My favorite character I have to say was the cat!<br />Coming soon to Theaters : Tim Burton presenting the movie 9, looks like another beautiful, strong story, visually stunning, animated movie not just for kids but adults alike!
0061562408|5.0|I finished this book last weekend and I could read it again right now.  It made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me wonder what my dogs are thinking every time I look at them now.    It's been a long time since I read a book that I just couldn't put down, and this book definitely fell into that rare category.    I can only hope that they never try to make a movie out of this one.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|i thought this movie was A+ when i saw it i sure wasnt scared of the water but i'll tell you waht, i was scared of sharks. once again the master george lucas brings us A+ effects, i wish i could give it 6 stars instead of 5 but thats how life is i guess.
0439023491|5.0|It is rare to find a book that you read and want to reread, but this is it.  This series has been compelling from the beginning.  The post apocalyptic world created by Collins is intriguing and horrific at the same time.  My favorite part is the character development as seen through the eyes of our narrator, Katniss.  Katniss has trouble identifying her true feelings, so the reader has to interpret through her actions.<br /><br />This book was full of suprises.  At each turn of the page my predictions from \\"Hunger Games\\" fell by the wayside.  Catching Fire headed in unexpected directions that kept my heart pumping and my head spinning.  I'll not go into any summary of the action.  If you read Hunger Games, I don't have to convince you to read Catching Fire.  Enjoy!
B001R3YRFS|4.0|I saw this movie way back then when it was on HBO and I was 12, can you believe that, folks let me watch it, with all the cussing, and violence. I didn't understand the undertones of the movie it self, the meaning i should say back then. I was 12, thinking oh cool watching an R rated flick. over the years this movie stuck with me, a great performance by Douglas, as I am not a big Joel Schumacher fan, even though his little \\"indie\\" film Tigerland was great. I liked this one too. Over time I realized the storyline, the plight you can say about what Douglas is going through. Middle Age guy, loses job, family, seeing world deteriorate in front of him, the ugliness of America.... hello Capitalism! Hello Merchandise! Buy! Buy! Buy!  Why can't we order Breakfast at McD's or Burger King just 3 minutes after 11:30? Come on now! Cause some guy with a Junior College Degree says we can't cause he has the cool headset and dictates what why we can't get a Breakfast sammy.<br />LOL sorry anyways. With the advent of technology 16 years later, hello Blu Ray, I saw this title finally coming to Blu Ray, with new commentary by Douglas and Schumacher! Just watched the film.... and WOW, with our economic times where it is now.... this films really resonates in the 21st century as it did in the early 90's. Watching this 15 years later just blew me away, I forgot how deep a story this is! Another movie about middle aged guys, over educated, and sees the redundancy of corporate America is American Beauty, another great movie. As I like to say \\"I didn't know this was pick on the middle age square guy today\\" Even though I am not even 40 yet, is this what my generation has to look forward too in 20 something years? History repeates itself don't it!<br /><br />Anyways back to the movie, picture on the Blu Ray, flawless, WB, did a nice job on the clarity, for a movie that's like 16 years old. Haven't watched it with commentary yet, but will, sure there will be some interesting insight from Douglas. I recommend this movie, like I said, this movie resonates what we're going through now, crazy!end this movie, like I said, this movie resonates what we're going through now, crazy!
B00000K19E|5.0|That quote is from filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, recalling his thoughts after seeing The Matrix for the first time.<br /><br />As for myself, I enjoyed it immensely in spite of the overt Christian symbolism. Just shows that the same story can have different meanings for different people. A balanced article on this subject--including many analogies you may have missed during the first viewing--can be found at About dot com: search for \\"The Matrix and Christianity\\"<br /><br />Admittedly I am not the biggest Keanu Reeves fan but in this role he plays the clueless Neo well, and Hugo Weaving is one of modern cinema's classic villains as Mr. Smith. I have not yet seen the two Matrix sequels; is a letdown inevitable?<br /><br />The special effects are still amazing even ten years on. The only downside to the DVD is the sub-par commentary track (with Carrie-Anne Moss and two others).
B000R8YC18|5.0|what a great film. i read a book on violence in movies and this was definitely in it, and you can see why. dont think of this as an action movie, this is what most dads would call \\"Artsy\\" but i like artsy. i dont want to spoil the movie but robert de niro kills a lot of people at the end and it is TIGHT.
B0000024YL|5.0|If you feel down, this music can really bring you up.  These are great songs.  Each is an individual masterpiece.
B0000CEB4V|4.0|This is a great tribute to George Harrison and his family by a number of well respected artists.  This reminds the viewer that the music of George Harrison is alive and well and shall remain timeless.  Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and Tom Petty all make appearances, as do members of Monty Python and some excellent work on the sitar.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It was designed to be shot in B&W. Sets were constructed, costumes were designed, and lighting was used to optimize how the movie would look on black and white film. Why would anyone think it was doing the film any favors to colorize it decades later?<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, and from the screen captures I've seen, the colorization on the most recent release (Two-Disc Collector's Set from 2007) is the best so far. But still, for me, the B&W of this classic film is still classic.
B000O77SRC|5.0|i watch this whenever its on cable, i dont care if i've seen it 100 times (i have) and my dad likes it a lot too.however i would suggest you cover your ears now and then because the language does get a little ROUGH if you know what i mean, but after you watch this one you will say \\"arnold who\\" because bruce wilson is just THAT good. if you haven't you should also check out die hard 3 and terminator as well. its a real treat. see you at the movies!
B00006JSS8|5.0|Great music that can and does move me to tears.  I love all the different styles.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|Very good.  I discovered the band from a YouTube video and decided check out some songs.  It's like Sara Brightman mixed with Goth rock and a bit of Evanescence.  So if that's not your cup of tea I don't suggest getting this product.
B00005N5RM|3.0|Once upon a time in 1958 a little horror gem was made, it was titled \\"The Blob\\" now the this blob wasn't like any other blob, oh no sir, this blob was mean and liked to eat people with its nasty gelatin..Ok enough cute talk, let's get to the movie.<br /><br />This remake of the original 50's classic makes the best effort to re-invent the story of a meteorite that carries a deadly alien life form...or so it seems. This time around we have Shawnee Smith as the lead protagonist (best known from Saw franchise) her role in this film is as great as it is in the saw movies, she presents a typical teenager, but with a little bit of attitude. Along are other forgotten 80's stars.<br /><br />I have to admit that the plot may be in certain ways similar to that of the original, but the Chuck Russell (Director) brings new gimmicks and frights to what you may think can be your typical cheesy horror flick. I myself was surprised by some of the moments were I jumped in the movie. The effects are also impressive, even though by today's standards they are outdated, there are still are alot of impressive mechanical effects that are not seen much nowadays.<br /><br />Personally this is a rare remake that's superior to the original. It's almost up to par with David Cronenberg's The Fly. I personally would buy it, its slick, funny, and of course slimy lol.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Logan's run is a clasic movie. An apocalipsis view of the future... but with hope of a new beginning. A 70's jewel!!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I,ve enjoyed this product. I like the new unreleased songs,and the book that came with the collection.
0439023491|5.0|Here's my attempt at a review without any spoilers:<br /><br />In Catching Fire, the revolutionary spark inadvertently begun by Katniss at the end of The Hunger Games isn't the only blaze spreading; Suzanne Collins causes our imaginations to catch on fire as well.  When I started reading The Hunger Games a few days ago, I didn't realize how much my imagination would be pulled in by the story, but other reviewers were telling the truth when they warned that they weren't able to put the book down until they had finished it!  The first-person narrative style of Hunger Games and Catching Fire isn't normally my favorite type of writing, but after reading through Hunger Games in one day, I couldn't wait to get to the library the next morning to take out Catching Fire.  I was expecting at least one or two other people to be racing me to the \\"New Young Adult Books\\" section to take out the 1 available copy...hey, I'm 22, but I can pretend I'm taking it out for my younger sisters, right? ;-)  Catching Fire met all of my expectations and (almost unfortunately!) has left me in even more excited suspense than book 1.  I guess that at least guarantees that I won't forget to buy book 3, whenever it comes out.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' story has a certain richness about it that I can't fully explain, but I think her characters have a lot to do with it.  Katniss, the main character in whose voice the book is written, truly is brilliant.  She shines on paper just as she does on the television sets throughout Panem.  And Peeta, whose goal in Catching Fire is to save Katniss' life and whose greatest opponent to that goal is Katniss herself, really does add depth and empathy to my image of Katniss, just as he does in the minds of those who live in the Capitol and the surrounding districts.  If Peeta, with all of his sweetness and determination, loves Katniss more than his own life, how can we help loving her, too?<br /><br />Though we readers may never have had to face death in an arena, surely we have faced inner struggles that enable us to relate to not just Katniss and Peeta, but the other characters in Catching Fire as well.  Struggles like jealousy, anger, fear about the well-being of our families, emotional confusion about love, choosing to stand against injustice, fighting when the odds seem totally against us--these are not battles that are fought only in Panem.  In all of her confusion, desperation, fear, courage, and determination, Katniss is someone we care about because her struggles are like ours, only amplified and more obviously life-and-death than mine usually are.  Though I may be a few years older than Katniss (and the majority of readers), I still get confused about life, love, and my own inner motivations.  As Katniss faces more and more physical, emotional, and mental difficulties in Catching Fire, I both sympathize with and root for her more and more.  The same goes for Peeta, Gale, Prim, Haymitch, and all of the other \\"good\\" characters even though their goals sometimes realistically conflict.<br /><br />Readers who enjoyed the Hunger Games should definitely take the time to read Catching Fire (but try to pick a day when you have several hours to sit down and read, because you probably won't be able to put it down).  Catching Fire is written in the same style as the Hunger Games, incorporating fascinating settings, excitement, suspense, intensity, and romance.  Where the Hunger Games left off, Catching Fire continues the story of Panem, but it doesn't finish the story.  And while Catching Fire doesn't give readers too many cut-and-dry answers about the struggles its characters face, it certainly gives readers a lot to think about...and hey, that's a good thing since we probably have a whole year to think.  Somehow Catching Fire doesn't seem like the kind of book I'm going to forget about during the year.  It's one of the few books I've read recently that catches my attention, holds it, and won't let it go when I stop reading.g.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I missed the original airing of Mad Men Season 1 but, read about the hoopla. I watched season 2 attempting, succesfully, to make sense of it all. Now that I went back I see Season 1, I see why it was rewarded with many accolades and emmys.  TREMENDOUS!  The writing is sharp, original, and the look of the show is unlike anything out there. Beware, the pace of the acting is different from you regular network drama, so be very aware. But, that's what I love about it. I still laugh to myself when I remember some of the lines the characters say. The extras on the DVD are terrific. And the people behind it are graduates of The Sopranos (which I consider the greatest show ever on the tube), so you have a great pedigree behind it.  Go for it!
B00005QGAT|5.0|Received the Michael Jackson CDs and appreciate the pricing which was less than I'd found locally at music stores, probably because of his death much of his music has  been marked up, I guess.  I'd bought the corresponding vinyl records when they were originally recorded (guess I'm aging myself!) and wanted to own the CDs.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Inspiring, magical, confirms that music has the power to change the world for the better. In a time of uncertainty, this is one thing that for sure makes you realize there is hope. Makes you wish we could get Iranian,Afgan,Iraqi and Jewish musicians together for the next cd, how even more powerful it would be.
B001GCUER0|5.0|the whole series keeps you involved,many subplots and just getting to understand what was really happening in the advertising industry  while growing up has been a kick.
0596007124|5.0|I have read only the first 2 chapters so far. I love this book. The informal way in which the authors explain to you the concepts is exemplary. I recommend this book.
B0026RHR6K|4.0|Short and sweet:    The re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series was phenomenal to put it simply. The series looks gorgeous for a normal DVD. The packaging looks pretty cool on the outside but on the inside, the discs are stored in individual boxes corresponding to the 4 seasons and are in these irritating according like cases which makes it in a challenge to get a disc out. On the top of the box in a coffin like cutout is a battle-damaged Cylon action figure from Diamond Select. The plastic on the figure feels a bit cheap but it's a pretty nice, articulate figure. If you have any other Diamond Select Cylon figures, the interchangeable hands do indeed work on the Cylon that comes with this package.
B000WS4QJG|4.0|Great CD.  Like just about all of the songs on the CD.  DVD is entertaining. Highly recomended.
B000VX4X3G|5.0|Those are classic quality shoes that I have found extremely convenient. When traveling for 2-3 days with only a backpack that holds all my clothes and the laptop, this is the only shoes I need.    I've ordered from shoemania.com through amazon and all went well.
B00132GBRA|5.0|I am an avid hiker and use my Merrells nearly every day. While they can be a little slippery on a wet rocky surface, they hold up better than boots priced much higher. The extra $10 for the GORE-TEX is well worth it. I have found them, contrary to other reviews, to be true to size if not slightly more roomy than others.    My only advice, other than to buy this product, is to avoid spraying deet/petrolium based products on them as it can make them wear a little faster than normal.    Excellent shoe!
B0029358GM|5.0|I like WILCO so this is a bit biased right? But another fantastic recording from a great band. Thanks WILCO.
0439023491|5.0|Wow, to be honest, I didn't really believe that Suzanne Collins could do it. I didn't think Catching Fire would be as good as The Hunger Games. However, I was definitely wrong. This book really lives up to the first, maybe even a little better.<br /><br />I have a comment though. The jacket flap summary for this book is very misleading, stating that Gale had Katniss at an icy distance and Peeta had his whole back turned on her . . . . Read this book to know what I mean.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I love this album, but I confess that on content and delivery alone, I probably would've given it 4 stars.  But for Whitney's guts and her fighting through her demons to get to the point where she could deliver as well as she does here, I gave her the 5th star as a bonus.  I didn't expect the Whitney of 20 yrs ago.  No singer keeps the flexibility and suppleness of their voice over that span of time.  Factor in Whitney's said demons and I'm certain her vocal chords have been through some strain.  Having said that, I really like the 40-yr old voice of Whitney.  She sounds like a real woman.  Someone who has been through life, hardships, love found and love lost, and there's a grittyness to it that is really compelling.  Her voice at 20 yrs old was gorgeous but unattainable...almost TOO perfect.  This new voice is believable.  Listen, don't get me wrong. Whitney's still got crazy good pipes. But now, to me anyway, she sort of sounds like herself with a little Patti LaBelle mixed in.  And the sound is current thanks to her collaberations with some of today's hottest writers and producers.  I'm a believer in redemption and applauding those who fight the fight and make it back.  Whitney fought the fight, and she is definitely back.

B000063UR2|5.0|what can i say? prepare to be swept away! this is a cinematic experience, not really a \\"movie\\" and to truly do it justice one would almost HAVE to see it on the big screen. but this longingly put together celebratory re-issue double disc dvd captures so much of the spirit of the film you will be sufficiently dazzled. enjoyable for children and adults, in no way \\"dumbed down\\" or rushed despite a nearly catastrophic studio fire carefully examined in the extras section on the dvd-- and--  it is  resplendent with not one--but TWO musical scores for you to choose from! this film is simply enchanting. tim curry is almost unrecognizable beneath his make up and costume and tom cruise is an impish delite in one of his very earliest blockbuster roles. mia sara is the perfect princes and alice playton is menacingly creepy as blix. don't miss out on this. this movie deserved to do soooooo much better than it did at the box office during he time it was released. remember--you are watching ART; i'm not gonna say the plot doesn't drag  and it isn't a wee bit short on dialogue--it is. but trust me, this is more than just a film.  this is an experience. :)
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I thought this was a very funny movie. It had a good love story, good acting, hilarious situations, and much more!

0525478183|5.0|If anybody is thinking of reading this book they should not hesitate. I read this book in two sittings and I think it is the best book I've ever read in my life. It's really a book about life but at the same time it is a book that I often found myself bursting out laughing and just couldn't stop, so my point is it's entertaining and at the same time it has a lot of substance and metaphors.   I think this book really shows what high-school teenagers are thinking and go through (being one myself) and is just a perfect book for them to read. Also it is a good book for adults to read to get a better understanding of teenagers and because well, it's just well written. John Green, I think you are a genius. Please continue writing; I look forward to reading your next book. (Looking for Alaksa is, as of now, my second favorite book).

B001DZ9GRE|5.0|This is well worth the money. I used to listen to Annie Lennox as I walked to and from school in London. I had a blast sometimes singing and dancing my way home and that was with a cassette Walkman. I'll never forget how her music impressed me then. It still makes the same mark now. Annie is in a class all her own. And though I thought she and her partner in the Eurythmics were odd in the 80's, I still sing \\"Here comes the rain again...\\" with the same passion and enthusiasm as I did then. This is a phenomenal gem to have in your collection.
B001PL4HZW|5.0|I was never the one to buy a soundtrack album. But being addicted to Twilight, i gambled away and bougth this online as it was not yet available in stores here. After all, hearing some of the songs from mp3 does help with the purchasing as i know i will love it.  Having said that, I have played the album on my car stereo since my purchase in late June non-stop until now. The album has a good combinations of songs, from my favourite MUSE, to Robert Pattinson slow number, to my current favourite Paramore.  This is an album that I can keep on playing everyday to fill up my Twilight crave until New Moon is out along with the new OST. Can't wait to see how that one will turn out.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|I love Diana Krall. She continues to amaze me with her love and passion for jazz. She seeks out all the greats whom she loves and puts her own daring spin on their masterpieces. She has a love and adoration that shines through her work and has me love and adore her in return. This album is sweet and a great tribute to A Girl From Ipanema. She takes the best of her voice and her craft with the piano and applies it in all the right places. Thanks, Diana.
0783225857|5.0|This is an all-time classic treatment of what prejudice does to people, and of the injustice there is when people react to their ignorance, rather to the truths staring them in the face.  It is a haunting tale which has been a totally different experience for me at the different times in my life when I viewed it.  This is one of those stories you should see many times throughout your life, as your own experiences will change your viewing capacity.    Gregory Peck, et al, do amazing work creating characters that seem to have lept right out of Harper Lee's pages.  The images that I saw in my mind while reading the book are clearly adapted in this movie and it is a wonder.    Bravo to them all!!!    I've watched this now with my son, and will watch it again when he gives me a grandson.

0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper was an excellent book. Read all day, stayed up until 2 AM reading so I could finish! Definitely a book you won't be able to put down! I shared it with my family, and friends - everyone loved it! The way she put all different characters in their own thoughts was the best part of the book. It gave us readers' different perspectives of what was going on, and how each character was feeling versus the classic of books where it is in the third person or one person is telling the entire story. I was not, however, impressed by the movie.
0618918248|1.0|Professor Richard Dawkins' \\"The God Delusion\\" is a genuinely disappointing read.  One would expect a scientist of the renown and experience of Professor Dawkins to avoid logical fallacies and circular arguments, yet the first third of the book is an amazing assemblage of these things.  Lacking any sort of rational foundation, the last two thirds of the book come off as nothing more than a slightly incoherent rant.  Professor Dawkins displays a surprising lack of knowledge when venturing outside the domains of his own field; while he delights in his ignorance of theology, his writing also demonstrates a curious lack of knowledge in history, as well as a lack of understanding of Augustine, Pascal, and Aquinas.  I suspect this work will give solace to those who already are of the same mind as Professor Dawkins, but it does little to persuade those looking for a rational reason to change their thinking.
B000002KFJ|5.0|After Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Black Sabbath returned with 1975's Sabotage with less of the orchestral arrangements from the previous album and returning to more straightforward rock. After the experiments from the last album they returned to more straightforward rock. Sabotage is known to be brilliant and to most fans it's the last of the great classic Sabbath with Ozzy albums. To me it's a classic and one of the best albums by Black Sabbath. But there's also a common judgement that Sabotage is one of Sabbath's worst efforts (with Ozzy) and that after SBS the band lost it for the 70s. Well, as you might have guessed I do not agree with this statement and believe that Sabotage is one of the band's strongest albums and holds up pretty well to the other ones. I like it a lot because it's not an overheard one like say Paranoid, it's different but still very good and brings something different and heavier.<br /><br />The album opens with Hole In The Sky, a bombastic shocker of an opener, a seemingly philosophical song and one of my favourite songs on the album and I feel it's one the best things the band ever did. It's also a song that Ozzy wouldn't sing often after the album's tour as its too high for him. Then Don't Start (Too Late) follows, an acoustic instrumental that we are used to get from the band by this point in their history. It's not bad but I think that the other instrumental song, Supertzar  is so epic here that it makes this one forgettable. Symptom Of The Universe is next, highly memorable for being one of the first true heavy metal riff, the song is just amazing as it gets to an acoustic part and then gets back to the heavy riff topped with Ozzy's screaming vocals. Megalomania is not cited often when Sabbath is talked about, it's the band's shorter songs that take the credit, but this is something else. It's a masterpiece that is hard to describe, it's great and then it gets even better as it switches to another tempo and an evil voice sings with Ozzy, then there's the solo and then it gets even faster until the conclusion, you're just left sitting there realising you've heard something amazing.<br /><br />Thrill Of It All is a slow rocker, it's not one the high points of the album but it's still pretty good. Supertzar is an epic instrumental talked about earlier, it's just so mysterious with the choir at the beginning and you just have the riff and some percussion at some places and that's it. You just have this intriguing title and that's it. Am I Going Insane (Radio) is Ozzy's showcase, it's him alright as he sings \\"tell me people, am I going Insane?\\" it's a great song you get a feeling here of what he would be doing in his solo career. Some may be intrigued by the (Radio) mention, it's actually british slang.<br /><br />Sabotage is one of my favourite Sabbath albums for many reasons; it's heavier in some ways, epic, it's got some much underrated songs and just some the best stuff they've ever done. It's just underrated, one may think that. Let it be known, I think the band hit their creative peak with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (maybe before) but Sabotage is in no way boring, underachieving or a repeat of past work: it stands strong on its own. As someone already said, it might be the most consistent album Sabbath has done (at least during the Ozzy era), every song has something good to offer. So if you thought the band was over at this point I suggest you give it a listen and we'll see.e's the solo and then it gets even faster until the conclusion, you're just left sitting there realising you've heard something amazing.

0307266303|5.0|If you are a runner, this is the book to read. It's a true story about real people running today and it really captures the joy of running. It makes me want to throw my shoes in the bin and just go running barefoot all day. With my sensitive feet I know that's not an option but it made me reconsider much of my so called knowledge about running and what running is really about.    The book is a thriller and it has some truly fascinating characters.    So take of your shoes and start reading.

0446364495|2.0|The Clint Eastwood film on which this is based, starring Clint and Meryl Streep, is a masterpiece -- one of the greatest romantic films ever made and in my opinion Clint's best film as director. It cuts the mushiness and phony earthy spirituality mixed with sensitive machismo to a bare minimum, and it concentrates on the female lead, Francesca -- because Clint and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese rightly understood that her story is the more compelling on the big screen.<br /><br />I think it would have been more compelling in the novel as well, had Waller chosen to make her anything more than a fantasy figure, and his stand-in Robert Kincaid something beyond a too-good-to-be-true macho guy able to be sensitive and artistic, sensual and earthy, tough and terse all at once.  But that's what Kincaid is, and he ends up as much a fantasy archetype as Francesca, and we're meant never to question his decision to pursue the affair, hers to end it, or the fact that neither of them tries hard enough to find the other later, when Francesca is free.  We are never given enough to really think about the consequences - just to be sad and feel sorry for everybody.<br /><br />And the novel's prose is really abysmal, full of over the top descriptions of orgasms and such, and there's little feeling of real place or real character. Still, a kernel there somewhere is responsible for the great film, so I have to give it some credit.  But do yourself a favor and just watch the movie, this time.

B00197YZ7M|5.0|Closeup on a mailbox: Mr. and Mrs. Richard Johnson. Behind it, a dusty road leading through green fields, a minivan coming towards the camera and a pan over towards an isolated farmhouse. It's the present, and Michael and Carolyn have come to settle some issues regarding their mother's estate. It seems that their mother wanted her ashes scattered from a nearby covered bridge, which startles her two grown kids, particularly the seemingly very conservative and religious Michael. Turns out that Francesca had her reasons, as they find out when they open her cedar chest and turn to the diaries contained within...<br /><br />Late summer 1965, and Francesca, an Iowa housewife in her mid-40s is seeing her husband and kids off to the Illinois State Fair. They'll be gone for 5 days and she'll have little to do but be bored in a different way than she usually is, until the arrival the next morning of a lost National Geographic photographer, Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood). Kincaid is on assignment to photograph the covered bridges that the county is famed for, and Francesca tries to tell him the way to the Roseman bridge but quickly decides to show him the way personally instead. As they drive towards the bridge and make small talk, they seem uneasy at first - but when Robert mentions Francesca's accent, and she finds that he has visited the town where she grew up in Italy, something starts to click. He reaches for a cigarette from the glove compartment and brushes her leg...later he picks flowers for her....they have the same favorite radio station, playing blues and jazz. Francesca starts to see something special, exotic....Robert sees someone warm and real, centered but more than the simple housewife that she's let herself become.<br /><br />So begins four days of falling in love, four days of uncertainty, secretive glances, shyness turning to boldness, feelings long-buried in both reawakened and examined by two people smart enough to know right away how problematic an affair can be, yet willing to cast aside the doubts and damn the consequences. For now. The brilliance of The Bridges of Madison County isn't in any kind of originality, and it isn't in the bits of Waller's strained prose that occasionally leech through LaGravenese's generally excellent screenplay; it isn't in Streep's accent, which I know some have problems with but which I barely even notice at this point; and it isn't in the framing story, which again has grown on me over time but is certainly not all that interesting itself. What makes the film magical is the chemistry, the feeling of absolute rightness between the two leads, and the slow building towards an inevitable yet still heartbreaking decision.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood certainly must have seemed an odd choice to take on this film, which he co-produced and co-wrote the elegiac \\"Doe Eyes\\" theme for in addition to directing and starring - even to me, a big fan already at the time, it seemed odd. Robert Redford seemed to be everybody's idea of Kincaid, and Steven Spielberg got mentioned often as a possible director, but I doubt many people will have problems after they see the film. Eastwood's Robert is a sensitive guy, but he's not schmaltzy, a poetic man but not pretentious about it, and a man clearly as unsure about the concept of love and the kind of risk he puts himself into as the married Francesca. He's a traveler and a loner, but deep down there's something missing, something we can feel almost from the beginning, something seen in the long gaze out the window near the end, and as he stands in the rain, waiting and hoping, at the film's emotional climax. And Eastwood the director keeps things from getting out of hand sentimentally until the last half hour, when both he and the audience know it's time for the tears to flow.<br /><br />But as good as Clint is - and this is surely one of his two or three best performances - Meryl Streep is just a marvel here. Overlook the accent - whether you like it or not, it really isn't terribly important here - and you see a less mannered, more natural performance than she's given anywhere else. She mentions a couple of times in the making-of piece that accompanies the film on DVD that she was uncertain at first of Eastwood's quick shooting style, but it does wonders for her, giving a spontaneity that she really needed for the role. So much of the film relies on us believing that these are two hesitant, uncertain people with a yearning that at first has no direction - it can't seem studied, and it doesn't. And for a film that is set mostly in a kitchen and around barn-like red covered bridges, there's an excitement and intensity that can't be matched in most romances shot under the Eiffel Tower or in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. The technical aspects - Jack N. Green's lovely September-October photography and the wonderful Eastwood-chosen musical mixture of Johnny Hartman and Dinah Washington, among others - are just about perfect as well.<br /><br />What the film ultimately builds to - and much of it is on Streep's shoulders - is a powerful examination of regret and loss and a determination that there are no perfect choices in life, only choices that involve different kinds of sacrifices. The film doesn't comment on the rightness or wrongness of her adultery, but Francesca lets her kids know that whatever she's done, she's not going to beat herself up over it - and neither should they. At the end, we know that whatever choice she made would have been difficult, would have involved hurting herself and others; there's no easy answer, only a bit of hope for the next generation, as they at least have come to accept and understand, and Francesca's ashes scatter on the wind....<br /><br />NOTE ON THE DVD: The transfer on this 2008 \\"special edition\\" DVD is very nice and the aspect ratio correct - really essential to this tightly-shot film.  Good if a little over-effusive commentary by cinematographer Jack Green and editor Joel Cox and a nice little making-of featurette.rtant here - and you see a less mannered, more natural performance than she's given anywhere else.

B0019CSXAM|5.0|This is one of the best comedy shows in a long time. It mixes real people with great fun and insane situations, creating an endless supply of laughter.<br /><br />Only thing I don't like about HIMYM is the whole Stella thing, as I think they totally milked that idea to the extreme.<br /><br />Just a FYI.. those 2 kids were taped in early season 1 - they have since grown considerably and would not fit the profile today. Also, the writers have no idea how the whole story ends, as they only write a few shows ahead of time, maybe have ideas for the rest of the season, so it's a very dynamic show.<br /><br />The entire cast and crew of HIMYM are fantastic and I hope the show will continue for many years.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|After the death of Michael Jackson, I wanted his music again. I purchased the album of Thriller back when it came out and I played that album to death! The music on that album was his very best, in my opinion. When I saw the 25th Anniversary Thriller CD listed, I chose it right away. It brought back some great memories, as well as being able to introduce his music to my 10-year old granddaughter! I love the extra tracks he made with Akon, Fergie etc. too!
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Academy award nominee Liam Neeson tears up the streets of Paris to save a love one in the fast-paced 2008 thriller \\"Taken\\". Retired CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) hopes to restore his relationship with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and reluctantly agrees to let her travel to France with a friend. When Kim and her friend are kidnapped by slave runners, Bryan must resort to his special skills to scour the French underworld before she disappears forever. Though not a groundbreaking movie, \\"Taken\\" is an amusing action-packed thriller from director Pierre Morel (The Transporter) and producer Luc Besson (The Fifth Element). It was released in France in February of 2008 but was released in the United States in January of 2009. With $145 million in the North American box-office, it was one of the first successful films of 2009. The story is straight forward with a few twists and character clich&eacute;s. Neeson's performance further drives the drama and the action sequences are a total blast.<br /><br />Despite a few early lackluster releases, 20th Century Fox has certainly deliver some fine looking Blu-Ray titles and \\"Taken\\" 2-disc Extended Cut is no exception. Both the 91-minute theatrical cut and the 93-minute unrated cut are presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. With a splendid level of detail and rich lifelike colors, the picture quality is indeed impressive. Its DTS-HD audio offers top quality clarity, dynamic surround effects and some good bass. Its special features include two audio commentary tracks by the film's director and crew, the \\"Black Ops Field Manual\\" option that allows viewers to follow the progress of the story, footage of the film's premier and two behind-the-scenes featurettes (Le Making of & Inside Action: Side By Side Comparisons). Overall, \\"Taken\\" 2-disc Extended Cut scores a \\"B+\\".

It downloaded (after a long time) to my Kindle, but was unreadable, and wouldn't download successfully at all to my iphone. Amazon ignored my on-line plea for help. A few days later, by telephoning the Amazon help desk, I was told that the file was faulty, and that I would be issued a refund, the Kindle version of the book would be withdrawn from the Amazon website, and the publisher would be contacted to prepare a new Kindle file, which might take months. None of these things has happened yet, a week later. Doesn't Amazon test Kindle files before putting them on sale?
032147404X|5.0|I recommend Scott Kelby's books to anyone looking to learn about photography. The books are easy to read and well written. He doesn't bog you down with the minute<br />details of digital photography. He shows you a picture and how to setup your camera to shoot something similar. I find Scott's style more helpful than understanding exactly how the CMOS sensor in my camera works, like some books try to teach. The book is geared toward Nikon and Canon cameras but anyone can use the information in the book. You would just need to use your cameras manual to find the settings. After reading his Digital Photography Books I'm planning to ready Scott's Photoshop and Lightroom books.
0307269191|5.0|What a gem, this book. It's inspiring, it's a quick read, and it makes me desperately want to get back on the road running. Plus, it's an abrubt 90-degree turn away from everything else I've read by Murakami. For one thing, it's a memoir. But it's such a simple, honest, charming memoir, as well; you can't help but love Murakami by the time you're done.<br /><br />The picture we get of Murakami is of a very mortal human being, talented and intelligent but more diligent and focused than anything else; these the same attributes have allowed him both to write a novel every year or so, and to run at least one marathon in the same interval. I was reminded of Stephen King's description of how he writes, from the intro to The Stand (revised, uncut, and excessively long edition):<br /><br />  When asked, \\"How do you write?\\" I invariably answer, \\"One word at a time,\\" and the answer is invariably dismissed. But that is all it is. It sounds too simple to be true, but consider the Great Wall of China, if you will: one stone at a time, man. That's all. One stone at a time. But I've read you can see that m****r****er from space without a telescope.<br /><br />Or Nora Roberts's method, as revealed in her New Yorker profile:<br /><br />  At Vesta, she said that she has one key commandment of writing: \\"[Butt] in the chair.\\"<br /><br />Murakami's writing and his running, he says, both have this one-stone-at-a-time, butt-in-the-chair method behind them. He runs every day, even on days when he doesn't want to. He sits his butt in the chair and writes. He keeps at it; eventually, with lots of hard work, a novel appears on the other end, and he finishes a marathon.<br /><br />The reader -- this one, anyway -- could be excused for thinking that this humdrum tone is false modesty: that beneath it all, Murakami writes a lot and writes well because he's brilliant. He wouldn't deny for a moment that one needs a measure of talent to be a writer, but he says focus and discipline are at least as important.<br /><br />You might wonder whether Murakami thinks of clever plots for novels while he's running. Turns out he doesn't; he just listens to a lot of music and zones out. His zoning-out reached its peak during a 60+-mile ultramarathon in northern Japan. There he felt for 10+ miles that he wouldn't be able to make it, but he just.kept.pressing.on. Eventually he reached a state where he could no longer feel pain, and where thoughts flowed in one ear and out the other. He reached the finish line after passing many of his fellow marathoners. He has completed one marathon annually for the last 20-some years, ever since his early thirties.<br /><br />That's one of the reasons why What I Talk About... struck me so strongly. I got my start running last year, and had gotten up to really enjoyable 45-minute runs, when my flat feet knocked me out of commission and made my left ankle continuously achy. I've been itching to get back into running, trying to find a doctor who won't tell me, \\"Your feet are too flat; you should never run again.\\" Murakami's book is the inspiration I need, both to get back on the road and to write a book I've envisioned. One foot in front of the other, butt in the chair.<br /><br />Finally, not a small part of What I Talk About...'s charm, for me, is that much of it takes place within Cambridge, Massachusetts. Apart from indicating that he taught at Harvard and gave some lectures at MIT, it's not clear why Murakami was here, but he was, in the middle of this decade. He lovingly describes his runs along the Esplanade, often getting passed by comely Harvard undergrads; he has a real appreciation for my beloved city, which can only endear him to me.<br /><br />What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is a quick read.

0030565812|4.0|One of the most compelling stories of our age. A political prisoner for over half his adult life changes the world and becomes president. Mandela (the man) gets five stars, no question. In my mind, the single most important political figure of my lifetime. The book is a different story:    I bought this book at the Robbin Island gift shop, where Mandela spent 17 years of his life in exile, I spent the next 17 years of my life trying to finish it. The manuscript is excessively detailed--pages and pages of meeting minutes...several times I almost gave up. The author's voice is vanilla, but the story he tells is Neapolitan. It was Mandela (the story) that keep me going long after I might have given up on Mandela (the writer).    LWTF is heavy on narrative voice and light on scene development, characterization, and dialog. This is a history book written by the hand of history. And, it reads exactly like that.    This one is worth your while, if you're young and you have a lot of years left. If your getting up there in years, you may not live to read the end. But fear not, your IM'ing, ADD grandkids will be able to make a killing by recycling the paper.

Phoenix Rise     Can't say enough about this CD yet not sure I can string together the right words (in the short amount of time that I have to write this review) to do it justice. Soulful, sexy, gritty, powerful. Just some of the words that come to mind. The musicianship on this album is so amazing. So quality. So deliberate. Crisp when it needs to be. Soft when it needs to be. It's the perfect storm for great songs: a soulful crooning Maxwell + captivating lyrics + impressive musical/instrumental accompaniment = a CD well worth buying! I preordered this CD and made up my mind to get it the moment I heard \\"Pretty Wings.\\" That song stills me every single time I hear it. It's not a song that I can just listen to ... playing in the background. I'm forced to \\"experience\\" it, immerse myself in it. I find myself wanting to know more and more about the life experience that inspired this piece. It's beautiful and my favorite cut on the album. My second favorite is \\"Stop the World\\"! Have mercy!, this song is sexy! STW will get anyone with a pulse in the mood for lovin' FAST! lol Simply, it's a song about sexual love with the one your heart belongs to and the powerful effect of that act: Stop[ping] the world. The way he belts out \\"Love You\\" is so intense. There's a hint of ache, forcefulness and strain in his voice that kinda literally takes my breath away. I feel like of all the pieces on this CD that this one is perhaps the one he poured himself into the most. The energy of it is truthful and raw. Familiar with the saying (athletics) \\"Leave it all out on the field/court\\"? (which means giving it EVERYTHING you have, your heart, soul--EVERYTHING. Abandon. Reserving nothing for afterward.) That's how I feel Maxwell approached \\"Love You\\" on this album. Ache comes through in Maxwell's voice in \\"Fistful of Tears\\" as well. It's a song aboutthe conflict of sticking to something even when you're not sure it's working or worth it versus walking away. I like the rhythm of it: the rhythm in the way he delivers the lyrics, the rhythm of the music/instrumental accompaniment. My very few complaints would be 1) \\"Cold\\" seems kind of choppy and really doesn't do it for me; 2) I so appreciate his message in \\"Help Somebody,\\" but it's kinda out there hanging by itself; and 3) I wish the last cut, \\"Phoenix Rise\\"--a trademark jammin' Maxwell closing instrumental--ran for a longer period of time: it's only about 2.5 mins. All that being said, get this CD! And if you can, see him in concert!
B00028HBKC|5.0|Excellent movie. Don't care for the subtitles but you can still understand what's going on. Not for the weak of heart. Very emotional.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|The P21 provides both great sound and a great mike in one headset. I got this headset so that game sounds would not permeate the house, and I'm pleased with the performance. I realized that the ability to distinguish where certain sounds came from would not be present, so I wasn't surprised with that deficiency. But that appears to be the only deficiency, and I'm learning how to compensate for it. And unlike my 6:1 sound system, I can hear softer sounds better.
0756405890|2.0|The main conceit of this book is that the main character, Kvothe, is telling his own tale to other characters in the book.  Kvothe - a self-proclaimed master storyteller - declares that he will speak of his past experiences in three parts, or over the course of three days - of which this book comprises the first.      This is pretty much impossible.      If we take all of Kvothe's narration to be \\"as he spoke it,\\" then there simply isn't enough time in the day for a person to comfortably tell this tale.  I won't link out to it, but the Audible version of the Name of the Wind audio book clocks in at 27 hours and 58 minutes.    Now, not the entire book is comprised entirely of Kvothe's telling.  There are framing sequences set in the book's present day that make up anywhere from 10-15% of the text.  But even taking account for that, the characters in the book aren't depicted as spending 24 hours of that first day solely on listening to Kvothe's telling.  There are other events taking place that take up time, and the characters do go to sleep at night.      A true master storyteller wouldn't be rush, rush, rushing to get through his life story.  Pacing, gestures, and facial expressions would all be a part of the experience.  So we shouldn't believe that the characters were speaking and acting really, really fast.  And indeed, the audio book's runtime confirms what I'm saying.    That leads me only one explanation:  Rothfuss has made a freshman mistake.  This book is too long, his time frame too short.  For me, it has affected both the story's believability and my perception of the main character's credentials.  So much is boasted about Kvothe's abilities.  Many reviewers have mentioned that the character is overblown.  Here is real evidence that the character was credited with too much!  And yet I doubt that Rothfuss will correct this mistake in his next book, which takes place during the second of three days of telling.  If anything, I expect the page count to blossom, as the author is buoyed by his fledgling success.    I feel that the whole naming concept, the magical school and its masters, and other circumstances surrounding the main character are a little too close to key elements of [[ASIN:0553383043 A Wizard of Earthsea]].  The Chandrian remind me of the baddies from the [[ASIN:0812538366 The Wheel of Time]].  One could argue that these are just standard fantasy tropes.  However, this book is touted as being more than just standard fantasy.       Aside from these issues, the Name of the Wind is an overlong but decent read.  I do like the rules of the world's magical physics.  They're not as technical as those in, say, [[ASIN:0886773571 Catastrophe's Spell]].  But they do offer dimensionality.      I wish I enjoyed the characters as much.  The love interest, in particular, annoys me.  She is given the sort of cheshire cat (one moment they're smiling, the next they're gone) personality that used to fascinate me in real life as an awkward 15-year-old, but that I have no sympathy for as an adult with a stable, happy marriage.      The plot is fine - or at least what there is of it.  I found myself enjoying the first part of the framing tale more than the main content of the book.  Maybe that's because there was some action.  I will give the next volume a chance when it comes out because I'm not the type to put down a series once I start.  But that is perhaps the only reason I will be continuing.  That and some nagging instinct that there will be some improvement in the next volume.

1597771791|5.0|Sorry to be so short but my review title says it all.  The ladies describe a totally different world.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|Highlights on this album for me are: \\"Crawl\\", \\"Manhattan\\", and \\"Use Somebody\\" (pre-overkill on the radio).    I think this is a relatively solid album that got mixed in with a bunch of garbage, which is what took me so long to get to this one. There are some terrible songs on this album and there are some songs I never get tired of.    The distinction with this band is definitely the vocals. Very different, and in some cases, its what makes them awesome/suck. Some songs are perfect for his voice (i.e. Sex On Fire, Crawl) and some songs just make him sound like a dying animal. But that's just my taste I suppose. If you can get the album cheap, go for it. Otherwise, I would preview songs and buy them individually.

B00000IQV7|5.0|This is one of those movies that I kept wanting to watch, but never got around to it.  With the long holiday weekend, my family decided that watching this would be a good way to spend part of the time.<br /><br />I loved it!  Patch Adams is a fascinating character and the story is wonderful.  Robin Williams is at his best -- not too over-the-top but absolutely hysterical at times.  I was laughing out loud in parts and very deeply touched in others.  What more can one say about a movie?<br /><br />I also have to say that Monica Potter is great in this.  The camera loves her and she can really, really act.<br /><br />A great movie that runs the full range of emotion -- terrific!
0307266303|5.0|You do not have to be a long distance runner to really enjoy this book.  The author, just a hack runner, sets off to find, interview, and run with a hidden tribe of Mexican Indians who reside in one of the most desolate areas of the world; Copper Canyon.  The Tarahumara are reported to be extremely gifted at running distances that can exceed 100 miles in record fashion, only to wake up the next morning and do it all over again.  Despite what many sport physiologists would consider an activity that would wreak havoc on the body, the Tarahumara, for all intents and purposes, run injury free.  How is this possible?  Christopher McDougall sets out to discover the reason behind a tribal tradition in which 80 year old indians run almost as far as their younger counterparts.  In his quest for the truth the author seeks out Caballo, a very mysterious non-Tarahumara who is probably the only outsider who has been somewhat welcomed into the Tarahumara fold as one of their own.  Throughout the novel, the reader is introduced to a slew of eccentric individuals who are into the sport of ultamarathons and other extreme long distance events.  They are most interesting people who I feel I got to know personally through McDougall's fine literary style.    This book is about about people exploring their inner selves and trying to find their true inner potential by not clinging tenaciously to typical standard protocol.

B000M341QE|5.0|\\"The Departed\\" (2006) is a thrilling, totally riviting crime-drama, directed by the award-winning Martin Scorsese, delivering what is undoubtedly his most enthralling film since the masterpiece \\"Goodfellas\\" (1990). \\"The Departed\\" was based on the Hong Kong film \\"Infernal Affairs\\" by Alan Mak and Felix Chong. William Monahan delivered the scorching screenplay, crackling with savage, brutal wit while producers of \\"The Departed\\" included Brad Pitt, Brad Grey and Graham King. With such a high calibre team behind the scenes, the impressive array of A list actors all deliver magnificent performances, complimenting the stark blend of unflinching violence, harrowing, psychological drama and exhilirating, rip-roaring action scenes.    Young Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a rookie, Boston-based cop. Billy grew up in a world surrounded by crime and violence. Billy's superiors, the diligient Queenan (martin Sheen) and ever-obnoxious, but straight, Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are desperate to catch notorious local mafia godfather Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and see Billy as the only suitable member of the team, given his background, to go undercover and trap Costello. Reluctantly Billy agrees, seeing he has little choice, and cunningly wins Costellos trust.  The intriguing drama unravels further when, unbeknown to Billy, Queenan and Dignam, is that Costello had groomed sneaky and nauseating Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) to be his unscrupulous spy on the force. In a flash back sequence at the beginning of the film, it depicts that Costello had preyed upon Colin when he was just a young boy and brainwashed him to his evil, corrupt way of thinking.    Heading the cast is another stunning performance from the versatile Leonardo Di Caprio as the mentally tortured undercover cop Billy Costigan. He conveys many dimensions to his character, giving it infinite depth. You get a more psychological insight into his character during the scenes where Billy pours his heart and anguish outto his understanding councellor, who he subsequently ends up having an on-off affair with (while she is dating Colin Sullivan).  Jack Nicholson is devilishly evil as Frank Costello, the highly feared king of the underworld. His mere presence in the fim enhances the seedy, cut-throat atmosphere. Costello is clearly insane and when he discovers there's a \\"rat\\" among his team, his paranoya escalated further and he begins losing his mind. This is played with stark realism by Jack Nicholson who is in his best role in some years.    Matt Damon plays the snake Colin Sullivan, Costellos mole, and shines in all of his scenes. On occasions during the film, you question whether you should really feel some empathy towards his character having clearly been brainwashed and manipulated by Costello when he was at a very impressionable age. However, upon witnessing Colin's underhand tricks and how he evidently wouldn't think twice of killing anyone he even suspects as getting in his way or bringing him down, you suddenly lose that slight sense of empathy.  Even the luminous lead performances by Leonardo Di Caprio, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon have an extremely hard job not being upstaged by the stunning, scene-stealing supporting performances from Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen. The ultimate on-screen hard man, Ray Winstone, is terrifying as the cool, calm collected hitman Mr. French. Ray's understated performance is oscar worthy! He possesses a strong screen presence and the way he can shift from being composed to just suddenly gunning down somebody without even blinking, is ever-riviting to watch. Very edge of your seat stuff! Quite simply he steals any scene hes in and even Leonardo Di Caprio and Jack Nicholson seem slightly humble in his presence.    Mark Wahlberg is also thoroughly fantastic in his memroable supporting turn as the snide Dignam. Dignam is, thankfully, on the right side of the law (until the end that is - wont say anymore as dont wish to spoilt it for those that yet to view this film) but revels in winding up undercover mole Billy and constantly cross paths with him, Colin and other members of the force. Mark Wahlberg richly compiments the rapid flow of the razor sharp dialogue and seemingly breezes into his character almost effortlessly. Martin Sheen is also of good value too, in his small but effective role of the more sympathetic detective Queenan while Alec Baldwin also delivers a scene-stealing performance as a passionate though often aggressive cop.  With a gallery of top notch actors, an intriguing screenplay, first-class direction, rollercoaster dialogue, \\"The Departed\\" is an exceptional film, and nothing short of a masterpiece.    The extras on this double disc set are all fascinating. they include additional scenes with introductions by Martin Scorsese and documentaries such as Stranger than fiction:The story of the Boston Mob, The real Life Gangster behind Jack Nicholsons character and theatrical trailer. Excellent value for money!  Ian Phillips  September 2009
B00005QGAT|5.0|I love this album. Everytime I go out to the club the DJ will play at least 4 songs from this album and people run to the dance floor to start getting down which is funny to watch. Great ablum to listen to even if you don't like disco and my favorite song on this album is \\"It's The Falling In Love\\" track 9. This song seriously needs to be played more. If you are Michael Jackson fan then you should buy this album and I promise you won't regret it.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|Well, there is nothing to say about this movie. It is simply not Indiana Jones. Just a commercial movie to make big bucks. This movie is so different from the other movies of this great franchise. There is no soul, no magic, no adventure, no excitement, no humor, no rational action. To make it short, there is nothing in this movie. I was very disappointed after watching this stupid movie. Indiana Jones is gone forever, that's all... and so should do George Lucas or any people involved in this piece of sh..    Sadly really a bad movie! :(
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Kinji Fukasaki's \\"BATTLE ROYALE\\" (Batoru Rowaiaru, 2000) is the type of film whose reputation precedes it. Remade recently as \\"The Condemned\\" by the U.S., the film sparked such controversy and almost became banned from its native Japan. Its hype was far-reaching that when the movie reached America, it was even proclaimed the `movie of the decade'. I'm not sure whether I can agree with that claim but one thing's for sure; Japanese filmmakers had the guts to pull off a movie that depicts violence and murder done by teenagers. It is easy to dismiss \\"Battle Royale\\" as an action-packed, exploitive thriller but the movie is just so much more.<br /><br />In a not-so different alternate future, Japan has experienced economic collapse with a massive unemployment rate. With no clear future, students begin to disrespect the education system, with an increase in riots and violence, student drop outs are also occurring at an alarming rate. To control the situation, the government enacts the \\"Battle Royale Act\\" that consists of the selection by secret lottery for one of the poorest performing class in the country and sending the students off to an island where they must fight each other to the death until only one is left standing. The students have 72 hours to complete the game or everyone dies from the explosive devices on their necks. They are supplied with random weapons, given special instructions to avoid danger zones and if they make trouble, the army will find them and kill them. Former friends are forced to kill or be killed; the students experience mistrust, fear, confusion and hatred, as chaos run unchecked...<br /><br />\\"Battle Royale\\" serves as a cautionary tale for the teen generation. It does start off simply enough, with themes of morality and immorality are presented in the film's first act. There is a small hole but the film's plot holds strong as Fukasaki's adaptation of the novel generates suspense and gritty thrills as there are no dull moments in the film. It also lets its characters speak for themselves, characterization is partly done through the use of flashbacks. Kitano (played by Takashi Kitano) is the former teacher who has his own issues, the students all have different backgrounds, and they all have different reactions to their situation as well differing motivations. I liked the characters especially those of Mitsuko (played by Ayana Noguchi, her character shines in the Special version) and Noriko (Aki Maeda), they appear to be similar sides of the same coin although very different. Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara, Death Note) is the one person who tries keep his moral beliefs, I may even go as far as his only motivation would be Noriko. Kawada (Taro Yamamoto) is the one student who was mostly an enigma throughout the film, his motivations remained unclear until the final act.<br /><br />The film has a subtle but powerful social commentary as well but none as resounding as the message Fukasaki brings into exposition for teens. Fukasaki does keep the messages restrained to avoid the film from becoming ruined by a heavy-handed sentimentality. He brings the idea of \\"working together\\" which was formerly the foundation of Japanese society. Overtime, such teamwork collapses as the sheer pressure of survival proves too much as mistrust plants its ugly root. You see some students working as a team, but such \\"team-ups\\" are ultimately ruined by insecurity and fear. The film's final act resoundingly says that one has to trust each other wholeheartedly in order to achieve success. Fukasaki also encourages today's youth to \\"go for it\\" as if to say that the future is theirs for the taking; believe in yourself and don't be too hasty in trusting adults. There are also several other strong messages in the film as certain dark themes in the complexities of everyday life are touched on; jealousy, fear, meekness, dishonesty, love, shame and helplessness. The characters do have a way out of this situation and they must face the problem head-on; they must do the best they can to deal with it. The reactions are pretty reflective of their own sense of morality (or immorality).<br /><br />The film has sparked strong controversy in America for its main premise of \\"kids killing kids\\" and while the violence is indeed brutal and uncompromising in this director's cut, it is not much as to how violent it is, (I've seen films more violent and brutal) but the film touches a nerve that makes it hard to see kids killing kids...it is not so much the act of killing but the who is doing the killing. It is pretty disturbing to see kids acting like this, some are scared that they commit suicide, some try to take advantage of others while others revel in the violence for fun. Having innocents put in a situation where they must kill people they know to survive is the troubling part of the film. I also think that Fukasaki cautions teenagers from mocking adults and to mind themselves otherwise, the repercussions of their actions may be just be too much.<br /><br />The dramatic scenes aren't overwrought and I liked the even direction done by Fukasaki. He never allowed his social commentaries or his heavy themes and messages mess with the film's action and violence. Fukasaki appears to also be poking fun at the dramatic sequences that anyone can form an attachment to the film even by approaching it from an exploitive, unadulterated dark fun standpoint. The film is also suspenseful as you see the death toll rise up after each `update', one can easily feel dread wondering whether the characters they've rooted for would survive. (6-8 of them take center stage)<br /><br />America easily proclaimed the film as brutal, violent and uncompromising but truth be told, the violence in \\"Battle Royale\\" isn't something new to the experienced movie watcher. The blood and guts (with mild gore) does help the film along, but it isn't all about the action but a matter of which Fukasaki delivers his message to Japanese society. Takeshi Kitano is awesome as usual and Masanobu Ando is creepy as the student who never speaks. Chiaki Kuriyama (plays Chigusa) caught Tarantino's eye that she played Go-go Yubari in \\"Kill Bill\\". (Did I fail to mention that this is among QT's favorite films?) \\"Battle Royale\\" is far more than an action film that glorifies blood and violence, some would say that it is simply an orgy of violent behavior while others who see the message will absolutely adore the film. It is one film that has the balls to portray violence that has real emotions going for it. One thing's for sure, it is one film that will never be forgotten and one that which Hollywood wishes it thought of the idea first--or had the guts to pull it off.<br /><br />What was that some say that Asian directors can't keep up with the big-shots of Hollywood? Those who said that deserve a Spider Finger Jab in the face...<br /><br />Highly Recommended! [4 ½ Stars]ust do the best they can to deal with it.

B000HIVOI2|1.0|This has been a bad week for me getting 3 different titles on blu-ray and all 3 with dreadful transfers.    The grain in this film is (at times) just plain horrible.  One scene in particular (around the mid-way point) in a cave it appears it's snowing black and white -- no it's not really snowing -- it's just a mixture of HEAVY grain and what appears to be artifacts.    Now not the whole transfer is as bad as this, just sections.    I recorded this film from DirecTV's HD-Net movies (or was it MGM-HD?) a few weeks ago and replayed it on my DVR and the same scenes look terrific on the broadcast version so it's definately a problem with the blu-ray transfer.    My display is 70\\" so maybe if you have a smaller screen you won't notice the disc's problems as much but for those with larger screens I would not recommend this disc.
B001U0D786|3.0|The movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made, I'd give 5 stars to it but what I'm rating here is the actual BluRay Disc.<br />I expected all BluRay Discs to come in the best available format to date which is 1080p/24fps, but this one comes in a lower quality format which is 1080i. Hence, I wonder, what's the purpose of buying this in BluRay Disc format? It really looks grainy, and it's unfair to a movie which won best cinematography.<br />The DTS sound is definitely very good.<br />The thing that annoys me most; is that it comes without any subtitles or any extra features at all, feels like playing a VHS.<br />Movies like \\"Coming to America\\" from 1988 (That's 8 years before The English Patient)has been restored in a much better glory than this one, which means it is possible to sell a better product they just didn't care to.
B001FB4W0M|2.0|I ordered Supernatural Season 4 blu-ray from Amazon.com and when it arrived I started what I thought would be a marathon watching the episodes.    Right away with the very first episode the quality of the video was terrible. The picture was full of grain (where there should not be grain) and overall the video just stunk. I did manage to sit through all the episodes over 4 nights because this show is one of the best on network tv and I've been a fan since day 1.    I am definitely not happy with the transfers of this season of Supernatural. Perhaps putting all 22 episodes on 4 discs didn't help the quality either. And, of course, none of the hi-def sites have had reviews of this set posted as of today or I would not have ordered it.    Such a shame too because I love this show and was hoping for at least the same quality that was broadcast over satellite.

0439023491|5.0|Katniss is back! She returns to her District under disconcerting circumstances, spending much of her time trying to smooth things over after her brilliant but controversial Hunger-Games-ending incident with the berries. So upset are the higher-ups at the Capitol, an ultra-big wig visits to remind her what can happen to her loved ones should she fail to convince the public that her romance with co-winner Peeta Mellark is genuine. Beyond the fact that the girl is (still) torn between two lovers (sounds like song lyrics...), she is increasingly concerned about the apparent rebellious actions of inhabitants of the various districts due to her own act of defiance (again, berries) as the 75th Hunger Games (dubbed the Quarter Quell) draws near. To say more wouldn't be very nice.<br /><br />Even though I don't think that the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy is quite as good as the first, I still loved it. My complaints are these (which might be a tiny bit spoilerish): Peeta's public lies about Katniss (implied to be helpful to her cause, though I disagree) didn't add to the plot, a person can't restart a stopped heart using CPR (I know it's sci-fi, but still), and the Games part, at barely over a hundred pages, was too rushed and not nearly as clever as that of Book One. In spite of all that, The Hunger Games is the still the best YA series I've read this year. Also good: Percy and the Olympians by Rick Riordan, The Giver by Lois Lowery and A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket.

Some of the advice hit my like a Mac truck and was a good reminder of how to take care of myself in a relationship.   I'm in the process of ending a nine year relationship and as I read through the book, I kept thinking \\"oh my gosh - I knew better than to do XXX and I did it anyway (as the book confirmed I shouldn't have done\\"  and the result is exactly what I got\\".  This  book has really helped me to get through my rough period and realize that finally leaving my ex WAS the best thing I could have done for myself because as the book says, it turns out that he really wasn't that into me.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I don't know why there are so many negative reviews out there. If you don't like comic book stories, then of course, this movie is not for you.  I think the story is pretty deep...especially the ending. You need to see the consequences of the very ending to appreciate it and the irony behind the whole concept. As for the movie itself, I have read the comic books and I think the director and producers did a great job of re-creating the comic book...almost frame by frame as I remember it, with a few adjustments to accommodate a more realistic process for a movie.  The ONLY things I felt were lacking and that could have done better were:  1. The President Nixon portrayal. Come on...this guy looked so obviously like he was wearing so much make-up and plastic that he looked almost comical and satirical. Couldn't they have found an actor who looked close to Nixon?? The makeup used on him looked so fake and stiff!    2. The only boring parts of the movie are the dialogue scenes between Dan and Lori. I know they were being true to the comic, but those were mostly the only parts where you can do something else or let your mind wander.  Oh...and the sex scenes were pretty graphic for a comic book movie...not for the under 18 crowd (I think I saw the Director's Cut).    3. I think the actor for John Manhattan was ok and he did LOOK like the comic (with the help of computer graphics), but I think they really should have picked an actor who's voice was deeper and more hollow-like. The actor they chose has a meek or light voice and sounds very wimpy. This is not the voice you probably imagine when you're reading the comic book. I don't know why they went with this actor.  They could have even enhanced his voice with special effects...but they kept it sounding so wimpy....this is NOT the Dr. Manhattan I imagined.    Other than those minor complaints, I think the movie was very good and I think Jackie Earle Haley steals the show as he did such a great job, in my opinion.   I don'tsee why people are saying that if you like the comic, you will be disappointed with the movie. It was almost exactly like the comic book up until the last 1/5 of the movie....what's to be disappointed?? Did you want to see something that wasn't in the comic??  (aside from the fact that they left out the Black Freighter comic sequences...but I heard they will incorporate those scenes with an Ultimate Edition due out later this year).
B000OVLBGC|2.0|Though this film won the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the average moviegoer will be bored beyond belief.  There have been other reviews calling it a \\"stunning suspense thriller\\" and I wonder if we were all watching the same movie.  No doubt it is artistic, subtly played with the minutiae of detail, but I was overwhelmed by the monotonous drone of the narration (in English). slowness of the plot, browns and greens in every scene.  If you have insomnia this is the movie to put you to sleep.<br /><br />Set in East Berlin, Germany in the year 1984 it runs through 1991.  The spy is the center of the movie.  His acting is minimal so the audience projects what is going on in his mind.  The writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck uses obtuse, vague, non-expressive acting from Ulrich Muhe (who plays Captain Gerd Weisler - starring role).  The narration is repetitive and confusing - you wonder if he is directing a play or listening in on other people's lives - it was not clear for some time.  The movie is two and a half hours long and it could easily have been one hour.<br /><br />The plot was contrived - there is a massive leap of of faith to believe an the German Democratic Republic (GDR) would give an entire group of GDR Stasi (a vast network of informers) resources and paid full time to spy on a patriotic artist, well liked by the public and the state, and not worried about arresting the Western spies that were prevalent at the time
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I am so gled to hear new material from a true singer. A lot of people complain about how she don't sound the same and that she lost feeling in her singing. I really believe that the individuals who are saying that minds are stuck in the 80's when she was in her twenty's. This is one album I can say that I can listen to from the beginning til the end. Each song that she sings you can feel what the words are saying in each song. I can see myself driving down the street with my significant other and playing worth it. I look to you sounds like her personal prayer. A song for you is the type of song that they play as the last song in the club. My personal opinion this album is flawless and no matter what mood you are in, ou will find a song for you

B0006GAI6Y|5.0|Existence precedes essence.  I tango, therefore I am.  John Clark seeks his essential being in a life of meaning and he is unhappy that he has not yet done so.  He sees Paulina at the window of Miss Mitzi's Dance School and the sadness on her face matches the sadness in his soul.  He decides to join the dance.  His joy and his trouble begins.  Finally his authentic self emerges in his essential self as a dancer.  He gets the rhythm of the tango, and becomes that self that he truly is.<br /><br />Is everyone with me?  We see that Paulina and John are a handsome couple, especially when they dance to the tango, Santa Maria, as she gives him \\"one hour\\" to enliven him for the dance competition.  Did John plan to leave his wife for Paulina?  Honor prevents that sorry pass.  Besides, he knows that a husband is like a roof on the house.  Everyone in the family take him for granted and does not miss him until he is gone.<br /><br />And yet, Paulina and John achieve an intimacy that is not about sex even if it is rooted in their being together as a woman and a man in harmony.  They relate to each other in terms of the beat.  Paulina instructs John, \\"Don't say anything, don't think and don't move unless you feel it.\\"<br /><br />The film Shall We Dance is alive with cross currents of electricity in the human condition.  See this film and then you can sing with Walt Whitman \\"The Body Electric.\\"  Do even better and join the dance.
B0000CABBW|4.0|The whale rider is a movie possibly placed in New Zealand based on the language accent I heard in the movie and by seeing the kitchen tapestry with New on it. The plot has to do with a Patriach/Chief of the village towns people wanting desperately to follow in the sacred spiritual ways of the spiritual ancestors and fulfill his duty of passing the history of the people and the responsibility of leading the people to an heir preferably a male.  He is set in his ways and tradition and doing so with such a tunnel vision perspective that in his attempts to fulfill this leadership void he fails to see the special gifts and destiny of his grandaughter a true bloodline decendant of Paikea.    The chief's name is Koro and he has pushed his eldest son so hard in trying to get him to accept this role and responsibility to the point of running his son away from the village and the people.  The son's wife died in childbirth while delivering fraternal twins where the male child died with the mother but the female lived.  The female child was named Paikea nicknamed Pai.  This is where Koro believes the trouble starts.  Koro loves his granddaughter however, with many of the world's customs unfortunately the men tend to make the women take back seats to the males and this is very unfortunate.  Koro rejects the idea of his grandaughter being the next spiritual leader even though she is of the bloodline of their ancestors and well God Paikea.  Tradition says that Koro has to pick a male.  Koro attempts to school several young boys in the ways of the ancestors and they failed so Koro has failed. All the while Paikea is trying to tell Koro, in her actions, she believes she is the next chief.  She even retrieves the chiefs well tooth that he throws in the ocean for the boy trainees to retrieve to show themselves brave, strong and approved by the ancestors.  Pai actually retrieves it and summons the ancestral whale Gods for help.  They listened and came to her aid even after Koro, in a state of failure and distress, failed to do so.    A pod of whales supposedly beached themselves but they were actually an opportunity for Koro to see that Pai had spiritual power and connection to get the entire herd back into the sea. Koro saw Pai riding the whale and then he believed.  This movie also showed the breakdown of predjudiceness, tradition, and familiarity with love, determination, diligence and destiny.  Pie helped to heal her people and her father returned home.  This movie relates to world religion by showing how tribes and cultures have continued ancient ways and beliefs in connecting with those whom have passed on. They have given them power and spiritual significance by labeling them supreme beings.  This significance and power have also transcended to the peoples every day lives.  World religions have taught people that the ancestors are in control of their everyday lives and futures and that the ancestors should be respected and consulted for directions.  In the Whale rider the supreme being was Paikea ironically the same name of the girl descendant and main character of the movie.  Pai, even though at the end of the movie proclaims that she is not a prophet (probably at the behest of Koro), does in a way assume the role of a Shaman.  Not that of a medicine woman but that of a healer because Pai healed her people.

B001H5X7I4|4.0|TROPIC THUNDER in some ways is not a very good movie. It really doesn't hold together as a whole and there are a whole lot of flat or uninteresting bits. At the same time, there are many, many hysterically funny moments. It is one of those movies that you have to make a pact with: if you forgive it its many flaws, you can have a heck of a lot of fun.<br /><br />I belong to that group of (not small in number) people who don't really care for Ben Stiller. I find his comic acting a tad too extreme and not terribly funny. But I confess that I enjoyed him in this film more than just about any I've seen him in. On the other hand, I often like Jack Black (I can't say \\"always\\" because of mistakes like NACHO LIBRE), but couldn't stand him in this one. On another hand (OK, I know that's three, but humor me), I absolutely detest Tom Cruise but loved him in this, though I have to confess that I didn't even know he was in it until someone explained to me who the chubby, bald-headed guy was. On yet another hand, I always love Robert Downey Jr., and I loved him in this one as well.<br /><br />I really don't think this movie is susceptible to any kind of beneath the surface analysis. You either find it funny or you don't. You can either get over the film's many absurdities or you can't. I was able to, but I can understand if others cannot. The reaction to this film is likely to be pretty much on a person to person basis. And I think that is borne out here by the all-over-the-place reactions to the movie. As I write this the movie has 90 five-star and 72 one-star ratings. If you haven't seen it, all I can say it that maybe you'll like it and maybe you won't.
0439023491|3.0|. . . is that darn book in the middle!  You know how it goes - the first book is dynamite, because it's all new and there's so much to discover.  The last book is explosive too, since we find out what happens \\"in the end.\\"  But the book in the middle . . . well, it's sort of like treading water.  It's a place holder, filler maybe, a way to stall the reader until the good stuff can start.<br /><br /> Hunger Games was exiting and compelling; we found out about Katniss's world slowly, which drew us into it completely.  My guess is, the final book will be equally engaging - after all, we'll learn all about District 13, we'll find out which of her two suitors Katniss will finally choose, and we'll get a glimpse of what lies in store for the Capitol and its totalitarian government.  But Catching Fire is a disappointment.  Nothing much happens.  The plot can be summed up very succinctly - unrest grows slowly in the aftermath of Katniss and Peeta's Hunger Games victory.  That's it.  Katniss can't make her mind up about Peeta and Gale, she can't make her mind up about whether or not to rebel, and she can't make her mind up about who to really trust.  In the end, not only is there no resolution, but little progress has been made toward one.<br /><br /> The biggest problem with Catching Fire is its pacing.  The first third of the novel is really told in summary - Katniss explains what happened when she and Peeta came home, what happened on their tour of the Districts, what happened when she talked to Gale, etc.  By telling it all in long paragraphs of summary, Collins removes the reader from the immediacy of the action - and it's both disappointing and disengaging.  I wanted to experience Katniss's first meeting with Gale after she returned from the Games.  I wanted be part of her trying to get her life together after her horrific experiences.  But that's not the way this story is told.  [***SPOILERS AHEAD***]  Then, about midway through the novel, things start to feel very much like Hunger Games revisited.  From the moment it's announced that Katniss will be thrown back into the arena it all starts to feel very much like a re-run.  What was exciting and new in the first book, is expected and redundant in the second book.  It's not that the final section isn't exciting - it is.  There's plenty of action in the last chapters of the novel.  But it just wasn't as gripping.  I found myself reading to get to the end, rather than to find out what was going to happen.  [***END SPOILERS***]<br /><br /> As with most \\"middle books,\\" Catching Fire was written to set up the final part of its trilogy.  There will be a rebellion.  And there will be a love triangle.  The sparks of the rebellion are there, although the reader is kept away from the actual embers.  Collins put more time into Katniss's confusion over which boyfriend to pick - I found myself wishing for something, anything to happen to make that rather silly conflict moot.  Katniss, as written by Collins, seems very, very young.  It's hard to imagine her actually \\"torn between two lovers.\\"  Additionally, Gale plays such a peripheral role in this novel that it's hard to really know him.  Peeta is present in almost every chapter - the sweet, loving, doting boyfriend who will be eternally true to Katniss.  Gale, however, appears in only a few brief scenes, and never says more than a few words.  Book 3 may give us a better picture of what these two young men really meant to Katniss; Catching Fire does not.<br /><br /> Actually, I think the title accurately reflects what this novel is all about - things in Katniss's world begin to catch fire.  They don't actually CATCH fire - it just begins; it's \\"catching,\\" so to speak.  The conflict was set up in Hunger Games.  The actual conflagration will play out in the third and final installment.  Here, in Catching Fire, we just see the striking of the match.  It's not a bad read, and fans of the first novel will enjoy this one.  I just found myself wishing for more - more of an understanding of Katniss, Gale, and Peeta; more of an understanding of the totalitarian government they live under; and more of a connection to a story that won me over brilliantly in Hunger Games.  This time, I felt a little lost.ng for more - more of an understanding of Katniss, Gale, and Peeta; more of an understanding of the totalitarian government they live under; and more of a connection to a story that won me over brilliantly in Hunger Games.  This time, I felt a little lost.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I first watched Band of Brothers when it came out on DVD years ago, and eventually picked it up on Blu-ray because I knew how great the picture looked on standard definition, and could not wait to watch the entire series again on Blu-ray.  The HD version is even better, with stunning cinematography and amazing sound. The series is so good, I actually find myself watching it every once in a while on television when it comes on around Memorial Day or Veterans Day. The series follows Easy Company from boot camp to the very end of the war. The scenes featuring the actual soldiers talking about their experiences really help you feel for all those guys. I've seen a lot of war movies, but Band of Brothers is unlike any other I have seen as far as quality and depth.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Anyone who enjoys military history or war movies will absolutely love Band of Brothers, and we can all learn some lessons of honor and integrity from these brave soldiers that the story is based on.
0312330863|5.0|All Things Bright and Beautiful continues the memoirs of James Herriot, newly married to Helen, as he continues his veterinary practice in Yorkshire.  This book is simply more of the same witty, incisive commentary on animal ways and human nature, and how they came together in his unique professional life.  Utterly enjoyable.<br /><br />There is, however, one scene on p. 321, in which Herriot rather gratuitously describes a dance partner's physical attributes, which parents may wish to omit if reading aloud, or discuss if a young person is reading alone.  This small blemish does not significantly alter the value of the story.

0312330855|5.0|All Creatures Great and Small opens an unforgettable series of personal memoirs by a country veterinarian in 1940's Yorkshire (also known as James Alfred Wight).  These are written in a series of short chapter vignettes, with a warm, wry humor that vividly, affectionately, and sometimes mercilessly captures human nature in the context of this cultural scene.  Many descriptions are laugh-out-loud hilarious, and will be spontaneously read aloud to the nearest listener.  But Herriot is no cynic -- his writing pokes fun at himself at least as often as others, and his self-deprecating wit provides an appeal that is near irresistible.  This first book in the series follows Herriot's starting-out years as a vet, his induction into Siegfried Farnon's local practice, his adjustment to the local ways and customs, and his courtship of the lovely Helen Alderson.<br /><br />A country vet's life involves a lot of bloody and sometimes gross work, which will appeal to some readers and may repel others.  There is an obvious appeal for animal lovers and potential medical students, as he treats both pets and farm animals, and Herriot sets a good moral example through his kindhearted willingness to undergo inconvenience and indignity for the sake of the animals under his care.  Implicit throughout his books is the belief that humans have a responsibility to provide good care to the animals who serve them.<br /><br />In his portrayal of his Yorkshire clients, he attempts to capture the flavor of their speech, and this does include some profanities.  The words \\"bloody,\\" \\"hell,\\" and \\"bugger\\" appear fairly frequently, but there are few American swear words.  Parents ought to use discretion, but I don't think this element should not be too harmful for mature readers.<br /><br />Because some of the humor is rather sophisticated and Herriot's prose is sometimes difficult, I recommend this for ages 16-18, but if enjoyed with a parent it is quite likely to appeal to younger readers, especially those who have enjoyed Herriot's stories for children [[ASIN:0312085125 James Herriot's Treasury for Children: Warm and Joyful Tales by the Author of All Creatures Great and Small]].erriot's stories for children [[ASIN:0312085125 James Herriot's Treasury for Children: Warm and Joyful Tales by the Author of All Creatures Great and Small]].

B000V6BE6M|5.0|Howard Shore is, without a doubt, the most brilliant film score/neo-wagnerian composer of our time.  The way Shore works with his motifs, each beautifully crafted and delicately textured, is nothing short of breathtaking.  Although the Complete Recordings are a bit pricey, the trimmed down version of RotK does not do it justice, and also scrambles the order of the tracks.  For the casual listener this will probably be enough of a taste of Shore's beautiful soundscapes, but any fan will have to shell out the extra cash for this masterpiece recording.
B001DHXT6G|3.0|The only reason I can find to buy this DVD compilation is if you want to watch it on the road, because you can watch every episode for free on Hulu. I forked over nearly $200 for my set so I could take it to school with me and watch it on my breaks (which are anywhere from 2 to 4 hours!) It's great, don't get me wrong, wonderfully remastered(although, I would prefer the original) It's still a great product if you have the money to spend. The one BIG BIG BIG problem I could find is that there were no English subtitles! Being as it is Star Trek, there is a lot of foreign vocabulary and I would have really liked to have seen the words written out for me... Plus, subtitles strengthen your linguistics and spelling skills! It only had Spanish and French subtitles, and thankfully, I speak both, so If I'm in a crowded area and can't hear through my headset, it sure helps.<br /><br />I love Star Trek, and have for 11 years, over half my lifespan! I had to have this collection so I could watch it on TV without sitting in front of my computer to watch it on Hulu, which is another reason why I bought it. It's a great addition to any avid Trekkie, but for the price... too rich for my blood, but I don't regret my purchase.

B0000CAXID|4.0|At first I hated this album only because of Dave Grohl's voice as I felt he was better as drummer instead of a guitarist/vocals but after listening to this and the newer albums I come to like his voice. I never knew Grohl was talented in bass and guitar as well as drums and didn't know that he recorded the entire album by himself. The album really sounds like it was rushed in production like its missing polish to sound even better its like it was recorded in a garage type atmosphere. The lyrics are very good kinda remind of Nirvana's music and the music is straight grunge/rock/pop/punk as each track sounds different from the rest. An overlooked album as the latter Foo Fighter albums are better and so much mature and improvement for Dave Grohl. Its still a good album that any fan of Nirvana/Foo Fighters should check out if they haven't already.

Luckily you won't have to invest 5 years as Abrams his crew wrap up a lot of the questions for the show in the first season. The writing and direction are for the most part top notch with production values and visual effects to match. After a couple of so-so episodes during the first half of the season where the producers were clearly searching for the best way to develop the characters, the show picked up steam and became a juggarnaut with a number of outstanding episodes that rank with the best \\"The X-Files\\" ever did.<br /><br />Update: A Warning about the Blu-ray: The Blu-ray isn't very well authored with the episodes \\"playing all\\" without having a choice as to which episode you want to play on start up.

0316017922|3.0|I'm an airline pilot and found the book very interesting, but when the author left out key details in the Korean Air accident into Guam's airport, he lost me.  Specifically, that crew read back the wrong altitude on the approach, likely a fatigue error.  That crew was issued \\"Decend to 2,200 feet\\" and they read back \\"roger, decend to 200 feet\\".  That omission killed that crew, it was not as Gladwell implies, that the copilot and flight engineer were afraid to question the Captain.  No pilot would have allowed that decent to occur, or would be afraid to speak up if he/she had noticed it.  Which now makes me question every other bit of data brought up with the book.  Nevertheless, it does have it's points and unique perspectives that are refreshing, particularly the Hockey theory and 10,000 hour rule.  These are worth reading, but take the whole book in realizing facts have been left out to oversimplify and/or overemphasize his point.

1423113497|5.0|I have been looking for an adventurous series for my almost 9 year old boy and finally found it.  I read the first book first then gave to him to read.  The author wrote with such wit and it is interesting to combine mythology in the story.  Now I want to go back to look for some mythology books to read.  It is truly enjoyable.. my son is not avid reader but yesterday he read this book 1 for 4 hours on our long road trip.  He is ready to read book #2.  I just finished book #2 so we can discuss... He couldn't put it down because he wanted to know how the story develops..

B000001GAM|5.0|Anton Bruckner 9th Symphony was dedicated to God (\\"dem lieben Gott\\"), and God in all His wisdom took Bruckner away from this world before he could complete this absolute majestic masterpiece of Music. The Adagio, no better ending for Bruckner's musical genius and the culmination of a great symphonic carrier; it is said that Bruckner composed the same symphony 9 times (if you do not count his earliests ones and countless versions), and with his 9th, he finally reached absolute perfection: there was no need for revisions or latter versions, God knew this and put Bruckner to rest, his task was fulfilled.    I believe that Giulini 'owns' Bruckner's 9th, if you like it slow (1st or 3rd movements), take this performance; if you like it faster, take his Chicago Symphony but either way you will be happy you are alive hearing this wonderful work, Giulini has the required touch of mystique and perfection. Another performance I highly recommend (specially for audiophiles) is Bernstein in a full digital live recording with this orchestra, Wiener Philarmoniker. Barenboim with Berliner Philarmoniker is fine, but some steps down from Giulini or Bernstein. Versions I can't wait to listen are Celibidache and Wand that are of highest regards. I would not recommend Jochum as a first approach to Bruckner's 9th, I know is a matter of taste, but I think his first movement is a little bit 'jumpy' and lacking 'mystery', hope his fans will forgive me.  Anyway, I read these classical reviews and people have very specific opinions on how they think the music should be performed or recorded, but putting aside personal likings sometimes I think that the music is forgotten: Which Bruckner's 9th is the best, Guilini or Jochum or Bernstein? Impossible to say, the only thing certain is that the only winner is Bruckner's 9th.    Nevertheless, if more than competent, whatever orchestra and whoever the conductor, this Music is so far beyond wonderful: the finale of the first movement brings shivers down the spine, all trumpets of Heaven playing in unison remembering us (that was Bruckner's intention) that the Almighty is there.
0545128285|1.0|Even for true Potter fans, this book is a letdown.  For teen/adult readers, this book is written in huge font and double spaced, making it read like a book designed for very young children, which strays from Rowling's original Potter style.

B002C2XXJY|5.0|This CD is awesome and everyone should go and buy it whether it's from Amazon or wherever. JUST GO AND BUY IT. Demi Lovato deserves a lot more credit then she receives just because of the fact that she is a disney star. By the way, she sings better than half of the non- disney stars out there and writes all of her songs. Every song she writes is either inspirational or easy to dance to. Anywho, sorry for the rambling, BUY THE CD BECAUSE IT'S WORTH IT!!!!!!! It's a huge success all around the world.

I gave it to my brother-in-law for his birthday.    Very nice services
0439023491|5.0|I loved the sophomore effort of Suzanne Collins Hunger Games Trilogy.  Based on above reviews, I thought that this book was just going to be a copycat version of the Hunger Games.  I was wrong.  While, yes, there were similarities, the focus of Catching Fire was different than that of the Hunger Games.  While the Hunger Games was mainly focused all on the games themselves and staying alive in the arena, Catching Fire captured a political focus that showed many more political aspects of the Capitol that before remained hidden.  It showed the lives of Katniss and Peeta outside the games and in District 12.  It portrayed the aftermath of the 75th Hunger Games on the nation of Panem.  I also liked that Suzanne Collins brought more of Gales character into the story.  I should probably stop there so I do not give too much away.  Lastly, I would just like to say that Catching Fire will bring back all of the excitement, suspense, romance, and grotesque methods of the Capitol that people loved in the Hunger Games.  Catching Fire captures a spark that turns into an all out FIRE.
0143034901|4.0|Someone familiar with my taste in literature gave me Shadow of the Wind to read, and I expected to love it -- a story about Barcelona in the 1930s sounded great. And indeed, the writing is fantastic. So fine, the book begged to be read aloud, which made me keep reading. The literary and historical references were interesting, and fun to relate to other stories or events.<br /><br />But the story left me cold. Perhaps it was the author's intent, but I couldn't sympathize with the characters and the constant twists and turns, denials and miseries turned me off. I understood the point the author was trying to make, but adding black to black doesn't (always) make it blacker. Sometimes you need a little contrast.<br /><br />Perhaps the author was showing the light in smaller, more individual ways, like the relationship between Daniel and Fermin, which is very tender, but the good parts of the story were smothered, in my view, by the overarching tragedies.<br /><br />Overall, the story left me feeling like I needed a shower, but the great writing will make me take a look at The Angel's Game.
B000065V41|5.0|We used to have the Muppet Christmas Carol on VHS tape that we can no longer see because of equipment updates.  This movie was so entertaining not just for children but also adults. Everytime we watch it we see something new we hadn't noticed before. The scenes are beautifully done. Jim Henson was such a master of puppetry and animation and it truly shows in this movie. It's also a great way for children to get a taste of the classic tale. Our family will watch this movie over and over again.

B001O4XWJM|1.0|I'm not a fan of Westerns, though I've seen a couple (\\"The Magnificent Seven\\" and its sequels, Sergio Leone's \\"The Man With No Name\\" Trilogy & \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\\"; I may have seen more, but the names escape me). I thought this movie would be worth viewing, as it had a terrific cast and an interesting plot. Boy, was I disappointed big-time. For one thing, the script is so damn weak John Ford would be apalled. SPOILER AHEAD!!! Big chunks of time are skipped over for instance, when the Ed Harris character says to the Viggo Mortensen character (see, that's how damn good the movie was...I even forgot the chracter's names, except that played by Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons [in my opinion, the only actor who did a good job despite the God-awful script]) that he's been with Renee Zellwegger's character for a long time. SPOILER OVER!!!! It didn't make sense to me. Ed Harris (who also wrote the script and directed) should be tied to an ox-cart and horse-whipped for even making such a slow-moving, turgid waste of a movie. I do not recommend this tepid movie. Watch a classic John Ford or Clint Eastwood movie.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This mini-series is of great quality and entertainment. It's fairly accurate to history, and presents it in a way that will keep non-history buffs interested. Great buy!
0143034901|4.0|This is truly a fantastic book.<br /><br />The description on the jacket can give you the basic details. Love story, biblio-phile story, mystery, adventure story, coming of age story. All wrapped in to one. Normally, that would be the hall mark of a really bad book. Few authors can accomplish so much in one novel. This one can.<br /><br />The book is intoxicating. From the melodrama of the passionate stories that parallel and infect each other to the bawdy, raucous sexual coming of age, to the pathos of the self-hatred theme that is explored through several characters, this book enthrals. Most importantly, though, it is a book that is fun to read. This is no literary classic that you \\"should\\" read by won't enjoy. The last 100 pages passed, for me, like 10.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Great. i absloutley love this album. I'ts very diffrent from her first. \\"Fearless\\" is stronger and better arranged, but i think her debut album is slightly more mature is some ways    Putting that aside, I'ts no wonder why this teenage girl who actually wears clothes has taken America by storm. Her talent is immense, and she has some of the beautiful stories to tell.     My favorites are Breathe, The Best Day, White Horse, and You're Not Sorry.    BUY THIS ALBUM!!!     Taylor you're amazing!
0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins has captured me.  Catching Fire continues to draw me in to this sad and scary world but a world that still hold beauty beyond the horrors. I had started book two and the only reason I had a hard time reading it is because of the heart break I felt for the characters.  I got so emotionally involved that I had nightmares that woke me up in the middle of the night.  Stay strong Katniss.
B001GQACGO|4.0|I don't understand why with her past 2 albums she has issued and re-issued deluxe versions of her material. Why? i don't understand, it's so annoying!    This is by far is her worst album. There are a lot of oustanding songs on here. but it drools heavily with filler.    My Top 5  1. Halo  2. Diva  3. Ave Maria  4. Ego  5. If I Were A Boy    There are a couple other good songs. but what i mentioned above is the only exceptional material she gave us for this installment of her perpetual \\"i wanna take your money scheme\\"    Maybe next time, we'll get our money's worth, and she'll quit toying with us, because i don't want to keep buying the same material for 3 new songs or whatever new album cover.
B001FBIPF0|4.0|Minus the kinetic energy of [[ASIN:B000LC4ZIK Infinity on High]] but still driving home the massive hooks they're known for, Fall Out Boy goes for the maturity prize on \\"Folie A Deux.\\" Given that their pals in Panic At the Disco couldn't survive the change that created [[ASIN:B00132D808 Pretty. Odd.]], it's interesting to note that the maturity seems tentative. There's the glammy lead off single \\"I Don't Care\\" and a string laden power ballad, \\"What a Catch, Donnie,\\" but the sounds you'd expect come through on the harmony laden \\"America's Sweethearts\\" and the semi-pretentious song titles.<br /><br />What's missing is that funky sense of exuberance that marked \\"Infinity\\" and [[ASIN:B000929AU0 From Under the Cork Tree]]. Just because you can get Elvis Costello to sing a line on one of your better songs and get the Neptunes to produce a track (the otherwise un-memorable \\"w.a.m.s.\\") singles more a shark jump than capturing artistic cred. Just ask The Hives, who made the great [[ASIN:B000WCBMA8 Black And White Album]] with Pharrel Williams only to see it vanish like their previous albums did. FoB are big enough to not worry, yet, but the somewhat subdued nature of \\"Folie A Deux\\" begins to raise the questions.
B00288KNJU|4.0|First of all I read the book so my opinion might be a little bias but overall I really liked this movie. I love this kind of animation which was exceptionally well done in this movie. It is very true to the book with some exceptions.<br />The blu ray version of this movie includes the 3D option with the 3D glasses. Let me note that this version is only on the 2ND DISC!!! When my boyfriend and I went to watch this the first time around in what we thought was 3D we soon lost interest in wearing the glasses because we unknowingly were watching the 2D version on disc 1.<br />Next I would like to say that this is a PG film and if you plan to allow your children to watch this I would suggest you pre-viewing it. For a younger child this movie might be a bit scary. After all the book was marketed to teens.<br />Finally I would recommend this movie to anyone who read the book, as well as those who enjoy similar films like The Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, or The Corpse Bride.

B000V1Y43W|4.0|This is a case of an animated feature which crosses age boundaries. On the surface it's a story of a race car suddenly out of his element.  It goes deeper to show how we all sometimes must face situations out of our comfort zone in order to discover our true priorities. The color, clarity and overall quality were nothing less than would be expected of Disney/Pixar.
1448649005|5.0|Frankenstein:  one of the most brilliantly written novels ever.  As well its smooth but Gothic style, it has also enlightened the reader via two powerful themes. First is its revelation of individual's fragility compared to nature's unparalleled power.<br /><br />Victor Frankenstein's desperate attempt in creating a monster of perfection is equivalent to an attempt to completely control one's fate and get rid of nature's influence, which results in nature's retaliation as the monster slaughters all the people connected to his creator, Frankenstein. The second is the excitement and fear from solitude and loneliness after the monster's escape.<br /><br />The former feeling exists before Frankenstein successful created the monster and the latter feeling arises after the experiment is accomplished and done. These two extreme feelings are dramatically and successfully portrayed in the book; coincide with our daily experience, showing how loneliness can help a person achieve the extraordinary and how it can make a person suffer unthinkably.
0307454541|5.0|I found this book totally enthralling. When I had to put it down, couldn't wait to pick it up again. It's filled with suspense, captivating characters, an unusual locale.

Something to take you out of your present life.<br />Phyllis Gebauer, author of HOT WIDOW and THE PAGAN BLESSING.

B00000DHR0|5.0|There are sixteen tracks here covering all aspects of Christmas, with a well-balanced mix of original or obscure songs and familiar standards. The booklet includes the lyrics for most of the songs including all the unfamiliar material. You probably know the words to the songs for which lyrics are omitted.<br /><br />Taking the standards first, they are Blue Christmas (featuring Diana Krall on piano), O holy night, Ave Maria, O come all ye faithful, The Christmas song, Brahms lullaby (although this classical piece doesn't appear often on mainstream Christmas albums), Happy Xmas war is over (the John Lennon classic) and Feliz Navidad (the Jose Feliciano classic). Suffice to say that Celine's versions are of a high quality and stand comparison with the many other recorded versions of these songs.<br /><br />The remaining songs are Don't save it all for Christmas Day (co-written by Celine), Another year has gone by (co-written by Bryan Adams), The magic of Christmas Day, The prayer (a duet with Andrea Bocelli), Christmas Eve, the title track (a Dianne Warren song), I'm your angel (a duet with R Kelly, who wrote the song) and Les cloches des Hameau (a Brahms song that is somewhat less famous than his lullaby).<br /><br />This album has been a popular choice among Christmas music buyers ever since its original release in 1998 and it's not difficult to see why. It is my first Celine Dion album, but it certainly won't be my last.

B000B7BRMM|5.0|For this album, Diana chose to vary the tempo by including some bouncy songs as well as the ballads that she has tended to focus on in her more recent albums. There are no original songs here, but two songs (Christmas time is here, Count your blessings instead of sheep) are rarely recorded compared to the other songs featured.<br /><br />Another notable feature of this album is that it focuses exclusively on the festive aspects of Christmas. You won't find any songs about Jesus here, so people of all religions and none can enjoy this album. That makes this a rarity among Christmas albums, since the vast majority include at least one song about Jesus.<br /><br />Diana and her musicians open the album with a distinctive arrangement of Jingle bells. She follows it with another up-tempo song, Let it snow let it snow let it snow, which includes a long instrumental break that allows the musicians (including Diana on piano solo) to show their talents. The remaining tracks are ballads except for Winter wonderland, Santa Claus is coming to town and Sleigh ride, all of which are performed either mid-tempo or up-tempo. Among the ballads, my favorite is Christmas time is here, perhaps because I don't hear it very often.<br /><br />This is a wonderful Christmas album that will appeal to those who like to hear Diana singing ballads, but which also reminds us of Diana's jazz roots.

B000002A46|5.0|With three original songs, one of which became an international hit for Mariah, together with a cover of a Phil Spector classic, one cover of a very obscure traditional song (Jesus oh what a wonderful child), which I don't remember hearing before, and six tracks featuring covers of famous traditional songs, this album has something for everybody.<br /><br />Mariah proves here that she can sing upbeat sons such as her big hit (All I want for Christmas is you) and her cover of the Phil Spector classic first recorded by Darlene Love (Christmas (baby please come home)), but she is equally capable with the slower songs such as her other two originals (Miss you most at Christmas time, Jesus born on this day).<br /><br />Of the six tracks that are devoted to famous traditional songs, one is a two-song medley (Hark the heral angels sing, Gloria in Excelcis Deo) which, together with the other five (Silent night, O holy night, Joy to the world, Santa Claus is coming to town, God rest ye merry gentlemen) offer enough familiarity to make this a good album to play as background music. Mariah sounds good on these songs although among them, I think she sounds best on the medley and Santa Claus is coming to town. Personally, I like to hear her on the obscure stuff best, but it takes a brave singer to avoid the standards altogether when recording a Christmas album.<br /><br />This is an excellent Christmas album that will give pleasure to many people, not just those who are fans of Mariah's other music.
0875428940|5.0|I finally obtained a copy of this now classic deck, that for whatever reason, I overlooked for years. I heard citicisms about the deck being politically incorrect and generally wrong. Nonsense! This is one of the hardest working decks I ever encountered. There are plenty of themed decks out there with cultural/ethnic diversity. This one is more focused on neo-pagan magic and aims for a witchy audience.     When it was published, most tarot decks focused on traditional religious symbols. The Rider-Waite deck, which most decks are based on, contained images from Victorian mystery schools. They often contained angels and Cabalistic symbols. Llewellyn was ready to launch its now thriving tarot catalog. It chose one of it finest artist at the time, Robin Wood, who's fantastic images graced some of Llewellyn's finest titles. A little kitchy yet very magical, these images are still as effective today. Wood's Tarot was published and the rest is history. It is one of the best selling contempory decks out there.     Personally, the court cards are my all time favorites. The offer the elemental fantasy that other decks only hint at. The backs have a wonderful and bold Celtic pattern. All of the major trumps portray an updated if somewhat otherworldly representation within. They are almost as familiar as the Rider trumps. A good deck conveys a sense of fantasy, so this one is great. In the sea of tarot decks published each year, this on has stood the test of time, remained in publication and is seen being read at psychic fairs annually across the county. That is saying something!
B00004YB9Y|5.0|Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti teamed up to create this masterpiece. At least, that's how I describe this Christmas album, which clearly appeals to far more people than just the hardcore opera fans. Whether those fans enjoy this music, I cannot say. I'm one of those people who likes to dabble in opera occasionally but mainly listens to other types of music.<br /><br />With the three singers all being tenors, you may not always be able to tell who is singing what unless you listen closely, or unless you are already familiar with their vocal differences. Perhaps that was their deliberate strategy. After all, it would have been possible to team up three opera singers with markedly different voices to create a contrast. Such an album might also be excellent, but it would be very different to this one. So I won't dwell too much on who sings what, except to say that each singer has one solo track. If you want to figure out the differences between them, you can begin by comparing those tracks. The other tracks include three duets with each singer sitting out one of them, with the remainder featuring all three singers. Thus, all three contribute equally to the album's vocals.<br /><br />In its original form, the album had 21 tracks, but my version (described as a special edition although it now seems to be the only version available in Britain) has 23 tracks, the bonus tracks being Let it snow and Jingle bells. These two fun songs aren't really typical of the album, which tend to focus on more serious material. On the main album, only Sleigh ride and Winter wonderland are in a similar vein to the bonus tracks. The remaining tracks feature the wistful White Christmas and I'll be home for Christmas, but also feature plenty of religious songs.<br /><br />Among the religious songs, O holy night, O come all ye faithful, Amazing grace, Silent night and Little drummer boy have all been recorded many hundreds of times, but these versions sound very distinctive, especially to those who don't listen to much opera. Perhaps the biggest surprise is among the selections is the inclusion of John Lennon's Happy Xmas war is over, which is easily the most modern song here, and which is rapidly on the way to becoming a Christmas standard.<br /><br />As somebody who like to listen to a little bit of opera occasionally, this album certainly has its appeal.

0061767581|4.0|I had heard a lot of good/bad reviews of this book even before getting it because of Lauren Conrad being on her own \\"reality\\" show. I did watch Laguna Beach and The Hills and I kinda think this book (even though it is \\"fiction\\") gives you a behind the scenes look at what goes on, that these shows aren't all are the the glitz and glam they are shown to be. We see drama on the TV but there is way more drama behind the camera. I think Lauren did a good job and tying the two worlds together and I look forward to the next book.

0316017922|2.0|Similar to Blink and Tipping Point, Outliers is constructed around various short stories that are loosely, and in this case questionably, tied together by an overall theme.  Similar to his other two books, some of the stories are interesting, but unfortunately too many of them are either fairly well know (birth date impacting chances of being a pro hockey player, IQ being a weak indicator of success), too superficial to decide whether there's any validity to them (Chinese math success being due to the way numbers are spoken, a small town in Pennsylvania being very healthy due to it being tightly knit) or too personal (he seems to have an axe to grind with people born into stable relatively well off families).  However, his attempt to tie the anecdotes together was clumsy, half hearted and half baked.  For example, to solve the difficulty faced by Canadian hockey hopefuls born later in the year, he proposes that Canada form a second set of hockey leagues.   Like many of his conclusions and suggestions, this raises a host of questions and issues that he does not address.  All in all, it's a very inconsequential book that masquerades as serious science.
B00204AA0O|4.0|Since I have traveled to Russia twice thus far in my life, I love to indulge in the cultural rarities the country does not tend to share with the rest of the world. The Russian-native now gone New Yorker Regina Spektor structurally holds this backbone for the country, and I was elated to find out she was releasing an album, Far, in June 2009.    As a songwriter, Spektor has produced five albums in eight years, the last being Begin to Hope in 2006. Her style is an endless scale of surprise, ranging from strictly accompaniment to the piano to hip-hop/pop tunes throughout each of her albums. Far truly grasps the nature of Spektor's past, highlighting her exquisite taste in the classical piano combined with her mezzo-soprano airy voice.    True fans of Spektor's other albums might be disappointed during their first listen of Far; many songs on the album have similar melodic musical qualities, and tend to run together. Though Far was advertised as a more commercial piece, the lyrics were the album's most moving aspect, and hit true to heart. From America's approach to religious deities to the simplicity of children playing in a Jewish community, Spektor links the missing chain of what is lacking in the cultural unity of our nation.    Spektor uses mathematics in the most popular Far song \\"The Calculation\\" to relate to her love life. She uses the lyrics \\"So we made our own computer out of macaroni pieces/And it did our thinking while we lived our lives\\" to express the normalcy humans strive to encompass when figuring out relationships. Spektor uses the color blue in \\"Blue Lips\\" to attend to human emotion in funerals and death, and touch on the basis of life with Adam and Eve.    \\"Laughing With\\" was the most moving song on Far for me. The cathartic reaction to \\"Laughing With\\", a song essentially covering the topic of God's existence through our everyday speech, is similar to \\"Blue Lips\\" in its severity and desire to elicit the consumer's thought. The lyrics alter from theeveryday jokes people make about God in parties, to how they view \\"him\\" when someone is dying in their life. It brings a new thought about Spektor, whether she is a believer or not, and also a thought to how humans process God culturally, able to laugh at \\"him\\" in times of jubilance and believe in him in tragic times. \\"Laughing With\\" is a song for those who are questioning, or simply trying to connect with a higher being, and have trouble facing the facts alone.    Other themes that Spektor carries out throughout far include songs relating to the appearance of a smile and the care quality of relationships.     Personally, anyone who likes singer-songwriter music that cares about the worries of a middle age woman would find a great buy in Far. Fans of an band who is more artistic than a simple spit-out artist, such as Modest Mouse, will obsess over Spektor's new tunes. Culturally, anthropologists should study Spektor for her bright and farfetched knowledge on the ways of our society, and how it will affect the future. Truly, anyone struggling with any emotional issue in their lives will appreciate Far, and will be able to hold onto it for future hard times.
B001OQCV2Y|3.0|Look, by now nobody needs one more plot synopsis of INGLOURIOUS - you all know the drill. Ditto on Christoph Waltz, who's very good (though I have a sneaking suspicion the level of hosannas he's receiving from critics are due to their never having heard of the guy before). For Tarantino and the Weinsteins, this represents a desperately-needed critical/b.o. rebound from the debacle that was DEATH PROOF, which is why it got a late-August release after all the other big summer movies have already come & gone. Add in the now-obligatory Tarantino-fanboy choir drowning out the relatively few naysayers and the result is QT's biggest-ever hit. But will you respect INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS in the morning?     Pros? Well, let's start with \\"hurray for Steadicam!\\" Finally, a movie that doesn't require taking two Dramamine in the lobby beforehand - hallelujah. Next, I'm happy to report that Waltz isn't the only heretofore-unknown (to Yanks, at least) European find the movie offers: Daniel Bruhl, Melanie Laurent, Michael Fassbender and Denis Menochet all turn in first-rate work. Fassbender's entire performance is a film-geek inside joke (he's Trevor Howard in THE THIRD MAN brought out of retirement, kinda), but it's a satisfying inside joke; Laurent and Bruhl provide the film with both heart and moral complexity; and Menochet - who resembles a younger, handsomer Jean Reno - is the unheralded component in that celebrated first scene, whose superb straight-man work sets up/off Waltz beautifully. The Bowie song works exactly as Tarantino intended it to (though he needs to lay off the Morricone swipes for a while - once is an homage; twice, a ripoff). The pacing, which has drawn criticism, is leisurely throughout, but that's okay: Tarantino is a storyteller who's as much about the asides as the plot - probably more so. He takes his time, sure, but we want him to linger in this world. (If your beef with IB is the glacial rhythm of the setpieces, wait a few weeks/months and watch it again- you'll probably discover you've changed your mind about the 'pacing' issue.) As for his long suit - the dialogue - he's mostly on form. And at least for once we get to listen to 40s hipsters, instead of the more tiresome contemporary kind (and I do mean tiresome: David Carradine's KILL BILL 2 monologue pretty much took the air out of that movie's tires, while DEATH PROOF clattered along, riding on its rims, interminably.)     Now for the cons. The marketing campaign for the film is just that, a con, and a huge one, right down to the \\"kosher porn\\" and \\"as a Jew, I thank you\\" quotes attached to the production; primarily designed to separate suckers from their scratch. (Somehow, I doubt Lawrence Bender and Harvey Weinstein would be very enthusiastic at the number of likable and even heroic Nazis in the movie had IB tanked that all-important First Weekend of Release.) This might be the first commando picture with hardly any commandoes in it! Secondly, there are so many logical and historical gaffes in the film they turn, inevitably, into potholes - you're willing to endure the first few w/o complaint, growing more and more ticked off as they just keep coming. (And please, no cries of \\"duh! - it's a MOVIE, Einstein!\\" We're not talking about a few holes here, but a block of Swiss cheese.) Third, the casting of Hitler and Goebbels is disastrous - a little levity is one thing, but this is CARRY ON FUEHRER!     And last (though hardly least) is the most troubling of all: at some deeper level, Tarantino movies are always about the cruelly kinetic joy of sadism and murder....and IB proudly continues this odious 'tradition'. The 'feminist' - and now, 'anti-fascist' - subtext of his films are just cynical window dressing, there to provide convenient but utterly bogus moral cover for the atrocities that make QT's wee-wee twitch to attention. Which isn't to say they're not effective: the image of Laurent's face superimposed on smoke in the film's gotterdammerung finale is real nightmare material, with a phantasmagoric eerieness that's hard to shake. But the crux of this sequence is watching screaming people trapped by design in a fiery inferno, and it's presented as popcorn-munching entertainment for the masses (we're meant to applaud in delight); given the hideous parallels to everything from the Triangle Factory to the Station nightclub (and to the poor souls who tossed themselves from the top of the WTC on 9/11 rather than burn to cinders), it's an evil scene. Depicting such a horror is one thing - CELEBRATING it as catharsis is something else entirely...... entirely too much, in my view. (The legion of Tarantino fanboys will no doubt insist that it's meant not to feed an audience's bloodlust, but instead to provoke thought and discussion. Well in that case, I'll be waiting for the Museum of Modern Art to book a HOSTEL II/MAN BEHIND THE SUN double-feature any day now.)    So there you have it. A well-made, fairly riveting Tootsie Pop, with a cancerous center lying in wait under the candy coating. I liked it for what it did well, though obviously with some deep misgivings; your own mileage may vary.
B0013FNC38|3.0|We watch Craig Ferguson (CBS Late Late Show) as much as possible, and always TiVo it in any case.  At the beginning of the show, we saw a delightful rendition/spoof of \\"I'm Yours\\" which was absolutely enchanting, even though the guitarist was in his underwear on the chair and the \\"singer\\" (lip-synch-er) was wearing black leather straps.  Thank God Craig told the name of the artist at the end of the show so I was able to go to Amazon and get the CD.  One of my car favorites.
3836504715|5.0|excellent book--has large photographs, whereas most of the Atget Paris collections have rather small reproductions. A pleasure to look at, and very reasonable price for this book
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Although I did not like the first song, \\"Outlaw Pete\\" the rest of the album was terrific.  Springsteen's voice has gotten better with age!
B000002H33|1.0|Metallica's third release.  After ride the lightning they were out of Mustaine riffs (Call Of Kthulu) so they came up with this.  At the time it was cool but now when I listen to it I have the same feelings I had with the black album, it just sounds boring and not half as good as other releases by far superior bands also from that time.  For me this is a meh album.
1416550534|3.0|I LOVED her second book (the Forgotten Garden) so I decided to read this one.  I was disappointed.  There were a lot of slow parts with tedious desciptions of the lives of servants.  The ending made reading the book worth it.  A nice twist.  I could not put her second novel (The Forgotten Garden) down and recommend it highly.  This was only o.k.
B000002H97|1.0|This is when Metallica changed their thrash roots sound.  I love their first two albums but by the time this hit they were on the verge of going meinstrteam and well we all know what happened after that corporatetallica with some of the worst albums ever made.  As for this it's not the worst album ever or aything but it it/was way overrated and recieved masses of undeserving praise.  I can't even listen to this album anymore as I find it very boring these days after hearing so much better music.
1416550542|5.0|This novel was amazing.  The twists and turns kept me reading from cover to cover.  I recommend this to everyone.  It was so well written and really kept me interested.  I was not at all bothered by all the changes of times and characters.  All the characters in each era were both sympathetic and interesting and will keep you reading to the end as you and they solve all the pieces of this hystorical mystery that spans times and continents. I could not recommend this enough.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second album is nothing short of amazing, the riffs are amazing, the solo's are epic, the vox are stellar and the songs are second to none.  With classics like Ride The Lightning, For Whom The Bell Tolls, Trapped under Ice, Call of ktulu etc this album is a fine example of thrash at it's best.  Metallica's second best album mostly due once again to Mustaines amazing songs.
0307454541|1.0|After all the excellent reviews I was expecting a well written thrilling novel with great character developement, creative plot lines and insight into modern and 20th century Swedish society.  Unfortunately only the first and last parts were somewhat true.  The plotting is uneven at best with a storyline that splits in the beginning and very unsatisfactorily comes together, so to speak, in the end.  In the middle we are enticed with some thrilling and sometimes gratutisly violent ( an S and M thread that screams plot device) moments followed by long boring descriptive accounts of international criminal banking, geneology, computer hacking and financial publishing to name few.  Characters are early on developed rather well only to become unevolved, stagnant or worse, simplified.  The reason I read the entire book is that it does have moments and I hoped it would improve, unfortunately I was wrong.  Overall the writing suffers from a lack of editorial economy which is interesting given the fact the main character is both a a writer and an editor.
B000002H6C|1.0|The fourth album from Metallica.  This album gets boring really fast.  It sounds like more of the same but slowed down with worse themes and even less impressive guitar work.  I mean if you compare this to the Overkill/Megadeth/Slayer releases from the same period this one is garbage.  Popularity causes things like this to be overrated and overplayed.  Another album I cannot stand anymore.  Plus this is the last thrash album they ever made and each release got eons worse.
0140157352|3.0|As one of the reviewers already said, it's a good intro to negotiating. I find it a bit dry towards the middle, and also somewhat repetitive. I agree with one reviewer who said that there aren't enough solid examples of the techniques and principles discussed. But it does give another way to negotiate. I especially like the chapters about when people refuse to \\"play the same game\\" as you, as in using \\"dirty tricks\\" and \\"digging in\\" to their positions. The authors do provide advice on how to counter these tactics, but it's much easier said than done.
B00013F38K|5.0|I enjoyed this show as a child so now some years later I'm enjoying it even more because it makes more sense to me.  There is always some lesson to be learned and good morals that we could all take on board. I cannot recommend this DVD enough!!  Buy it; you won't regret it.
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|This is a good album, with lots of great songs, and tons of Doors hits. From reading the liner notes, not all of the songs were completely recorded live, as some were reconstructed over time, using other concerts of the time, but you can't tell at all. I love the audio quality and the fact that they kept in the banter between Jim and the audience.
B0000A4GAK|3.0|Since I quit smoking dope, I have lost my enthusiasm for long drawn-out jam sessions. If you like Phish, Dave Matthews' live albums, the other albums by Blues Traveller besides \\"4\\", then this is an album for you. I \\"discovered\\" Derek Trucks as I have discovered many other modern guitar virtuosos by watching the Eric Clapton Guitar Festivals on DVD. I know he can play better songs than these, (too much good weed and magic mushrooms makes a person self indulgent). Get \\"Songlines\\" instead.
0788815490|4.0|\\"Wings of the Dove\\" is a gorgeous, lavishly mounted, film adaptation of the Henry James novel about a love triangle and the faustian bargains which the three people making it up strike with each other.  It reminds me of the old saying, \\"Be careful what you wish for because sometimes you might get it.\\"<br /><br />&lt;spoilers><br /><br />The plot is fairly straightforward.  Kate (played by Helena Bonham-Carter) loves Merton (played by Linus Roache).  But they can't get married because he has no prospects and Kate's domineering aunt who is her guardian threatens to disinherit her if she persists in seeing him.  Enter Millie, a beautiful American heiress (played by Allison Elliot) who has come to London to see a bit of the world before she dies of some disease that is slowly killing her.  It's Millie's wish to have a classic love affair before she dies, and she sets her eyes on Merton.<br /><br />Kate sees this as an opportunity for her and Merton to achieve their own happiness.  She tasks Merton to romance her, marry her, and when she dies, inherit her money.<br /><br />This would make Kate appear to be a heartless bitch...willing to prostitute the man she loves for the sake of money. But the genius of the story is twofold.  First, it is made perfectly clear that Millie knows Kate and Merton's intent.  And she's apparently happy to \\"borrow\\" Merton for a few fleeting moments of happiness before she dies.<br /><br />The second wrinkle is where the sting of the story is concealed.  Merton actually does fall in love with Millie and is devastated by her death...to the point where he cannot return to Kate's embrace.<br /><br />&lt;end spoilers><br /><br />The acting by Bonham Carter, Roache, and Elliot is all top notch and they succeed in making us like characters who we might not find so likable if we were reading about their romantic intrigue in a tabloid.<br /><br />But what really makes the story is the fact that the key parts of it unfold in Venice at Carnival time.  The city looks so beautiful and intriguing and is a perfect setting for a story such as this.for a story such as this.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Unlike many of the Dirty Harry films this one is poinant and real.  The character Eastwood portrays as a former auto worker was very much like my grandfather.  His values are tested when someone attempts to finish his new neighbors.  I have to reccomend this one because we get to see a sensitivity that Eastwood ever revealed to his viewers in a long time. If your expecting Dirty Harry, look out, it's far different than I'd ever thought it'd be.  An excellent contender for an Oscar. If you can buy this one.  You'll want to watch it more than once.
045122499X|4.0|It's been years since I read 'The Pillars of the Earth', so at first I worried that I wouldn't be able to follow the story without revisiting the first book.  Not at all an issue as one doesn't need to read 'The Pillars' to follow the trials and tribulation of the well-drawn characters of 'World Without End'.  The book depicts the lives of people who lived 700 years ago, but Ken Follett brings them to life and makes us care.  It's a really long book at over one thousand pages, but you becomes so engrossed in the story that you'll be at the last page before you know it.  An excellent book.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I started watching the show by myself but later on included my five year old. The show is a complete family entertaining show. It helps the children think about space and the universe. I love Billie Piper and Christopher Eccleston make a good pair.    Ecclestion is a bit rude in the beginning but you love him at the end. The show brings a little bit of everything , laughter, anger, and love.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Finally saw \\"Basterds\\" and I thoroughly enjoyed it! It was a suspenseful, funny, exciting WWII flick about assassinating Hitler.  I was surprised by how well the story was told in a logical linear way, especially for Tarantino.  Also, it wasn't THAT violent- meaning that for a revenge war film by Tarantino, it was just about right, especially since there was so much engaging dialogue & enthralling exposition that set the stage for the BIG VIOLENT PAY-OFF, that you just know is coming and that viewers of the film really want.  At least the packed theater where I was seemed satisfied, there was cheering and even clapping.  Some critics kvetched about the film's length, but it didn't seem long to me at all. In fact, I could have watched some more.  There were so many colorful characters in that film, if anything, Tarantino could have edited some but then again- the audience would not have met so many interesting characters.  It's a minor fault that didn't hurt the film for me.  Many of the actors gave emotional intense performances.  Very Good movie.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'm in my 40s and I've seen tons of flicks & documentaries about WWII and this is the 1st flick in a long time to make me wince and smile and gringe and cheer about the last Good War.
0316017922|2.0|Unfortunately, Mr. Gladwell's latest book is not on par with The Tipping Point. I'm not saying you won't find some parts interesting, but at the end you will be left saying \\"is that all there is?\\" By the way, he's a good writer but I'm skeptical of his research and the conclusions he makes. You will be too.
B000P0J09C|4.0|I first saw the movie Full Metal Jacket back when I was a teenager. Just recently I finished reading The Short Timers (which the movie was based on and long since out of print) by the late Gustav Hasford, whose just due as writer I feel is wrongly held from him. My favorite genre of war films are the ones about the Vietnam era. This includes this film, Apocalypse Now, Hamburger Hill, and so on. Stanley Kubrick (God rest his soul) in my opinion delivered in telling his view on war from a humanistic standpoint. The point Kubrick was trying to make was war is a natural order of things, but whatever cause one claims to fight for, violence will not serve any purpose. What is the purpose of going to combat if not to win but only to lose friends, and debating on whether one is a journalist or a stone-cold killer? The central theme here is man's duality when it comes to the theater of combat. This is best shown through Matthew Modine's character James Davis, a.k.a. Joker, who initially goes through boot camp on Parris Island. He gives us insight on how the individuality of a recruit is demolished, and rebuilt into a hard-nosed Marine or Soldier. The casualty of this ritual of boot camp is the hapless Leonard Lawrence, a.k.a. Pvt Pyle (Leonard Pratt in the book), played well by Vincent D'Onofrio, who is the hapless recruit continually taunted and scorned by the reasonably tough but brutal and sadistic drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann (Gerheim in the book), played brilliantly by R. Lee Ermey (who in reality was a former Marine D.I.), as well as his fellow recruits because of his mistakes. Eventually, Pvt Pyle \\"hacks it\\" physically, but all is not right upstairs because of the physical and psychological abuse internalized, and one will find out the tragic conclusion at the end of the boot camp half of the film.<br /><br />The second half of the film gets into the battle. We are in a world of [...], as some characters in the film would say. Some of the reviews I read cite this as being the least favorite part of the film because it drags on and did not have as much life as in the first half. Well war is not supposed to have life, and everything is abysmal and destroyed. Whatever preconceived notion that war is like a movie and one dies like a hero instantly goes out the window that was the feeling Kubrick wanted us to experience. By this time, Joker has become a hippie in uniform, and if we look deep into it enough, we can envision a profound sense of disillusionment within his character. The paradox there is even more defined by the peace button on his helmet and \\"BORN TO KILL\\" written on it, which is the question he will have to ponder later on.<br /><br />In my opinion, those of us who only see Full Metal Jacket as a film just about a group of Marines in Vietnam or the Marine Corps culture in general (alluding to the boot camp part) is missing the  point. It is a war film that was inherently antiwar(though Stanley Kubrick states that it was not his purpose)and no matter which branch of the service you are in as in grunt, be it the Army or Marines, everybody who was in the military at that time went through the same deal. Also one has to understand and appreciate the author, who was a former Marine who protested the war while in uniform, and decided to convey his experiences as a journalist through his novel. Mr. Hasford was addressing what he saw as the problems in the military culture back in his era; despite the apparent fact that armed forces were changing, it still was not very progressive socially. R. Lee Ermey's character of D.I. Hartmann or Gerheim, whichever you choose, though his character says he doesn't look down on anybody, was the enbodiment of the the old guard in the military. You know, the types that are reactionary and bigoted (which can attest to the misogyny, homophobia and to some degree racism towards minorities in the service, as well as the perceived enemy, the Vietnamese). It also shows that in order to survive combat, one must learn to devalue one's own humanity and turn yourself into a thing, and learn not to see the humanity in what one believes to be the enemy.<br /><br />Of course this is one best films I have seen about Vietnam. If one wishes to get further insight of the character of James \\"Joker\\" Davis, I recommend you read The Short-Timers and the follow up to that, The Phantom Blooper.t, one must learn to devalue one's own humanity and turn yourself into a thing, and learn not to see the humanity in what one believes to be the enemy.    Of course this is one best films I have seen about Vietnam. If one wishes to get further insight of the character of James \\"Joker\\" Davis, I recommend you read The Short-Timers and the follow up to that, The Phantom Blooper.

B0000TB014|5.0|I purchased this video about 3 months before the death of Michael Jackson and I'm so glad I did.  I have always been a fan of Michael Jackson and (all the other great 80's music).  This DVD has his greatest video hits and it is awesome.  Michael is at his best in these videos. (Beat it, Bad, Thriller, Dirty Diana, etc.) Buy it, you won't regret it!

B001AQTWF2|5.0|This album, is as she put in her \\"Thank you\\" section, \\"phenomenal\\"!!!  I MEAN....  :) I was SO GLAD about the lead single, MDB  :) This song has great energy and definitely is a classic. But I AM SOOOOO GLAD to hear the other tracks!! I was very attracted to I didn't know my own strength, and I heard it first when it was...leaked. :/ Although, I wish they would've kept her background vocals the last time she sang the chorus. Hmmm...STILL LOVE IT THOUGH, don't doubt!! hehe And JUST EVERY TRACK!!!! This album was done very well and LOVE LOVE your vocals   \\"shout out, shout\\" hehe IN love, Alllllllllll over again  I swear to you. Her vocals--as well as the message/concept-- on \\"Nothin' But Love\\" are incredible...incredible. This song had \\"Whitney\\" written all through it--irrefutably. There are always \\"little things\\" she does on a song that I LOVE: prime example, the ending of Worth It. \\"it's for you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you...\\" I was TOO tickled! I said to myself, \\"ONLY my baby, Whitney can do THAT!! YES!!!!\\"  Also, I'm very intriqued and GLAD about the direction with \\"For The Lovers\\"    Definitely something for the club!! I can do nothing but throw my hands up and around when that song plays!!!  That's what I'm talking about...this is yet another album that PROVES that she can do ANY song...so...very...well--exactly as her \\"industry father\\" promulgated.  :) LINL, very sweet, a NICE feel-good, GREAT track.     Call You Tonight...another song with your name all over it. I love her voice and the guitar riffs.... And the title track...DEEP. Profound. It was very obvious, as is with \\"I didn't know my own strength\\" (as Gayle King put it for this song, \\"...killer knock-out!\\"), from where she was singing. My God, Whitney....  :) And \\"Salute\\"...are you kidding me??? If this is isn't a single and not a video--I will be AGHAST!!!! Omg, this song is SENSATIONAL, fiery, passionate, and PERFECT integration of those gospel roots with an R&B base. LOVE IT!!!!! It's a favorite of MANY who have heard the song     She should call R. Kelly IMMEDIATELY and tell him, \\"We did it with that record!\\" \\"   And I Got You...another very contemporary song where the vocals are yet again (albeit, not surprisingly  on point and simply a great track--another one that is worth of being single.   Indeed.   This album and The Voice on this album truly epitomizes who she was and, more importantly, who she is now....  And who she is now is certainly inspiring and a beginning of a Whitney the world has been WAITING to see....  Not to mention she still proves why she owns an instrument that is still unmatched and revered (not respected, but REVERED) by so many.
B000002GK1|5.0|Forget the fact that this was labeled as grunge, because once you've really exfoliated this album, it's way beyond than what the media calls it.<br /><br />\\"Badmotorfinger\\", the 3rd album by the infamous Seattle group Soundgarden, is a phenomenal work that transcends the glory days of Black Sabbath and the hard rock vibe of Led Zeppelin, yet it is laced as one of the biggest standouts to come out in the early 90's. A stoner rock vibe is carried out at times, especially on \\"Outshined\\", a doom approach is heard in \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\", and even traces of punk rock are evident in tracks like \\"Face Pollution\\" and \\"Rusty Cage\\". While vocalist Chris Cornell is one of a kind that is barely ever imitated for his impressive range, I feel that the rest of the members don't get as much credit as he does. Guitarist Kim Thayil is amazing at what he does, with his dark rhythms overshadowing the album, and Matt Cameron's drumming helps to bend tempos throughout the songs.<br /><br />This album is an excellent embodiment of the band's influences put to great use, and overall I feel that it is an album that would be best off for fans of stoner rock like Kyuss and traditional heavy metal in the vein of Black Sabbath. A classic that is more than what meets the eye.<br /><br />9.2/10
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great DVD. Jillian is a beast on this workout video. You will see results. Don't recommend everyday but every other day. Good price for this DVD too. Twenty min and you are done.
B0006M4SO6|2.0|...was considering getting this as a gift for a friend to help fill in his PMG collection.  LIST PRICE?!?!? F That... I ended up picking it up at a retail store for much less.  Here's hoping that Amazon isn't going to start charging list for other catalog CDs as well. If you're looking to buy this, look elsewhere and save 4 or 5 bucks.<br /><br />Musically it's not one of his best.  Three themes get repeated over and over again in various different arrangements that segue into each other and are interwoven together, for over an hour.  Great playing, but it's kind of the same thing over and over again.  The tracks (Opening, Part 1, Part 2, Part 3) may seem overly long, but there are missing track index points.  There are sections that have definite endings, with several seconds of silence before the next section starts, but there's no track index there.  In general, each section is about 6 to 10 minutes.  Also, for some reason, at times the soloists are mixed in at a very low level and are almost buried by the rest of the band.  It almost seems like Pat's deliberately trying to confuse his listeners.
B0007TKH66|4.0|Combining a grittier, more dangerous period of space exploration with the usual \\"Trek\\" optimism, the first season of \\"Enterprise\\" delivers an entertaining array of often-ambitious stories, likable characters, and generous special effects.  On that last point, the show doesn't cheap out when characters have to take a shuttle down to a planet (which happens almost every episode in the show's \\"transporters only used as a last resort\\" era) and we get to see many nicely done sequences of the crew heading to and returning from their planetside adventures.  A small point to be sure, but the detail was appreciated.<br /><br />More importantly, the main crew members and their interactions are entertaining and fun, again mixing unpredictability (even Vulcan science officer T'Pol often acts in ways one wouldn't expect, based on our previous experience of the stoic Vulcan race) with the expected loyalty and cameraderie we're used to seeing among previous \\"Trek\\" crewmen.  Also adding to the unpredictable nature of the show is the fact that the famed \\"Prime Directive\\" doesn't yet exist, so solutions to delicate problems are quite varied and freewheeling.<br /><br />Season one of \\"Enterprise\\" looks and sounds great on standard DVD and there are a variety of interesting extra features, along with some commentaries.  Be warned, though: A pretty good cliffhanger, capping a solid closing episode, will likely have you ordering season two as soon as you complete this set.
B00005JPO1|1.0|We all know their hit films. and critical successes.    This is more in line with Spielberg's 1941, War of the Worlds,  Or Lucas Howard the Duck, and Star Wars holiday special, and those woefully inadequate and bizarre prequel star wars films.  This film continues the idiocy of the prequels but goes even further afield i was wondering when jar jar was going to show up.    And to top it all off the ending is literally the worst i have ever seen in any indiana jones film and belonged in a sci fi movie.    Minus a 101 stars if i could, this does not deserve no  3 and a half stars like the so called critics claimed, were they on the payroll?  LOL.

It has the Spanish version of \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" and a few other songs that I think people will eventually like. It also has the duet with Stevie Wonder called \\"Just Good Friends\\".

B001ECDVKE|5.0|What impressed me, in a way, was the overall TOTALLY MEDIOCRE acting done by this bunch of real pros. Then I got to thinking. They were probably doing that on purpose to mirror 50s versions of with actors of similar subject matter. (So bad it is good, theory) The main exception to this \\"bad acting\\" is Jack Nicholson's final Presidential rant. It is over the top. But the acting is not a problem with me as the Martians and other special effects are the STARS.  They are unbelievably cool and seamless in integration. They are what I waited eagerly to see and what had my total attention. The Martian language of gutteral spurts is so funny, their mannerisms, their unreasonable cruelty. The one Martian disguised as a bombshell blonde--such great work by the designers. It is also a shot of hilarity that while in J-Men Forever, Rock and Roll blasted from the moon is supposed to kill Earthlings, in this movie \\"The Indian Love Call\\" and other 30s Era music is the death potion for the Martians, whose brains explode in intolerance. Sylvia Sidney is great in this--she is in practically everything she does. Although it was released in 96 it seems that it came out only yesterday, and many of the cast members are now gone or their health is compromised. Many of them had been in earlier Sci-Fi flicks and it was a sort of Sci-Fi mini reunion. The Martians and the special effects get five stars from this ol' girl.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This film is enchanting. A true classic for its genre, it follows the story of a dwarf named 'Willow' after finding a baby floating down river. Each character in the story is fun to watch, the dialog is excellent and the effects are decent as well. The film is a bit goofy but the dark backdrop made it all the more interesting. From beginning to end, you'll want to stay in your seat as the comedy, drama, and action are all well worth watching. This is an older fantasy film, but definitely worth being in anyone's collection.
0525421033|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It's touching and sentimental without ever going over the top.  I had some trouble with the ending - not because it was unbelievable (although, really the whole premise is fantastical in nature) but because of the nature of the specific resolution. Vague enough?  I don't want to ruin it!

B002DKGWSO|4.0|You're a nice girl. Great parents with bucks. You like to have fun. You're on the swim team and you've knocked off the partying...well...almost. You head with your parents up to the lake-house. You meet up with one of your old gal-pals from the lake community.<br /><br />The community is beautiful. Peaceful. Your pal is getting off work at the local mart. Some harmless looking teen walks in and offers a peace pipe back in his room at the local vacation motel. Reluctantly you go. And everything is a stone groove....initially. Then it gets really, really bad for you.<br /><br />And for the viewer it gets hard to watch. Not since [[ASIN:B000EOTVUM Wolf Creek]] have I squirmed in my seat so much during some of the horrors that ensue.<br /><br />Garret Dillahunt is one mean mother in The Last House on the Left. He makes his [[ASIN:B00168HARG Terminator - The Sarah Connor Chronicles]] character look like a good guy with his portrayal of The Last House's bad guy. I didn't even realize it was him until the credits rolled; his facial hair and hair style in Last House are a better mask than when he was a headless Terminator!<br /><br />And the rest of the cast take their roles seriously. No stupid slasher movie lines or over the top campiness. Just excellent, believable performances from all....which makes this movie even harder to watch.<br /><br />Now picture yourself as a protective parent that has already lost a son, and imagine what you might be driven to do to someone that messes with your daughter.<br /><br />Oddly, everyone that I've mentioned and recommended this movie to said, \\"Hey, Last House is a [[ASIN:B001JV5BIA remake]] from 1972!\\" Well if what happens in the original is what happens in the remake, thanks mom and dad for shielding from the original when I was only 10. I'm pretty liberal with what I let my kids watch today, but this remake of Last House is absolutely not one I'd be so liberal with. This movie earned its R...or NR.<br /><br />Bottom line....<br /><br />What I expected: a gory, slasher, torture movie.<br /><br />What I actually got as a nice surprise: a well-acted, albeit violent, horror movie.><br />What I expected: a gory, slasher, torture movie.<br /><br />What I actually got as a nice surprise: a well-acted, albeit violent, horror movie.

B0009XNUK0|4.0|The Essential Michael Jackson gives a great chronology of Michael's music.  The downside of this is that it's really not good listening from start to finish (lacks the depth/character of an album that is designed as a set of tracks), but the 'essentials' truly are there.  If you want songs to pick and choose from, The Essential is great.

1590171993|5.0|This little book surprised me.I work in a small bookstore and this was recommended by one of my customers. To write it simply, this book is almost perfect. The beauty of it lies in its simplicity. Stoner is a 20th century man living a very ordinary life. How this novel differs is that he doesn't become angry, bitter, or cynical. He remains constant throughout the novel, he accepts the consequences of his life. He accepts his life as is and becomes resigned. Stoner is a lot people walking around today. He is America. Williams allows us to follow the life of Stoner from his colleges days to the end of life. The novel spans several decades, from the early 1900's to the '50s. He is a farmer that becomes a professor. He marries and has a child. It covers several wars, the depression, and other historic events. He finds the love of his life, not in his wife, but in academia. Stoner has an air of sadness and depression. Anyone who chooses academia as their great love will be lonely. His love affair continues from the halls of his college to his death. His love of literature resounds to me. I could relate to Stoner because his great love is literature itself. However, Stoner imagines his life may improve. He sees his family as something that it is not, a family. Perhaps the love of literature blinded his character to the fact that his wife is cold, manipulative and selfish. Literature can romanticism life and Stoner does that with his family.  Stoner remains stoic, reserved, but consistent throughout the novel. You know pretty early on what he will do and choose. However, I found his character comforting. Men like Stoner keep the world turning and functioning, in good times and bad. After reading this book I'm a John Williams fan and have began to collect his books. William has a very delicate hand in his writing style. He is a surgeon with his words. Slicing and selecting descriptions that present the truth of the moment. Please read this little gem of a book. Its almost perfect in its balance, truth, and simplicity.

0380973839|4.0|I'm not a huge science fiction fan and I've definitely moved away from fantasy to a large degree. Yet, all those disclaimers go out the door (or airlock?) when it comes to Bradbury. His stories always go well beyond the typical sci-fi/fantasy. They're darkly humorous and sometimes, just outright hilarious, while being brilliant at all times. This is no exception.
B0017HEYEI|1.0|I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this product, I didn't because previously I have been 100% happy with Amazon and its sellers and I therefore didn't give a second thought about needing to do such a thing.  I was a little confused when I received my disc yesterday to see all of the Korean writing, it did not mention this in the original description and I dont even recall seeing it on the picture that was provided.  I have not opened my packaging and I am very tempted to return the item.    Count me in as another customer who is 100% not happy with this seller.  Such a take!!
0375842209|5.0|This novel is a masterpiece.  I knew after reading the first few pages that I would not be able to put this book down. At the end of the story I felt an emotional attachment to all of the characters. Martin Zusak has weaved a wonderful story that will make you laugh and cry. It will also make you come away with a much greater appreciation of a time in history that is full of so many contradictions.
0735105855|4.0|It seems almost a truism to say that Agatha Christie's characters are \\"one dimensional\\" and that her dialogue is \\"stilted;\\" BUT her endings are so tricky and so clever she's worth the effort.    My opinion is the reverse! I loved this book precisely because the characters were so real and the dialogue so convincing. The ending, though tricky and clever, prevents me from giving this book a 5 star rating: it just didn't ring true; it's simply too difficult to imagine the culprit, whom you've gotten to know, as a sadistic blackmailer and a murderer.    A wonderful story nonetheless.    Dan C
0440241030|2.0|Seeing Lee Child's name in every single bookstore gave me the impression this guy is incredible.<br /><br />A friend let me borrow this book.  My first Lee Child.  Perhaps my view is somewhat distorted due to the fact that I started at No. 10 and not No. 1, nor have I read additional Lee Child books.<br /><br />The beginning had me into the story straight away I'll give Mr Child that.  But I kept expecting fireworks, amazing \\"wow how's he gonna get outta this one?!\\" plots and, in hearing some of my girlfriends talk about how spunky Jack Reacher is, a MORE likeable guy than what was actually on the page.  But no.  I found the plot average, not that engrossing, and it was only the last 50 pages where I held on to my seat cause the ride was awesome.  To have to wait until the end to get the awesome parts was a waste of my time.  I'll forget this one immediately and won't bother reading another Child.<br /><br />Average.<br />Average.<br />Average.<br /><br />Kids books are more engrossing.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Since this album is B-sides and Rarities you might be hesitant to purchase but...this album is great. Many of the songs could have been and should have been singles. Knowing that Pearl Jam wants to keep a low profile I understand why they were not. This is a  album to buy for the maybe fan or those that only know Pearl Jam through Alive or Jeremy (and of course fans). It is a sampling of songs that make Pearl Jam unique and special. Favorites on the album are Sad, Down, the great Hard to Imagine, Fatal, Footsteps and finally concert encore closer Yellow Kedbetter. Buy this album.

As I started to read this account, I was not sure I was going to be able to believe the narrator. However, as he melded his family upbringing with his professional path, I realized that this guy was a nearly perfect reporter on Dick Fuld's disaster. McDonald gives very specific first-hand data and motivations for Fuld driving Lehman into the ground, even as smart people all around tried to alter Lehman's course. Overlook the uneven writing and sensationalist cover and read it for its unflinching view of a great American tragedy and the resulting ramifications.

1579126278|5.0|I can see why she is known as one of the greatest mystery writers of all time. I thought I knew who the murderer was several time...and I was wrong and never saw it coming! Sometimes, when you never saw it coming, there are holes in the explanation and you think the author stretched it a little...not the case with this book! It all made perfect sense, but it would have been almost impossible for the reader to figure it out.    Not only is the mystery fantastic, but the characters are round and complex, the writing is superb, and the setting is easy to see in your imagination. It was one of the best books I have read in a while and look forward to reading more of her books!
0061562408|5.0|One could criticize this book by saying it is too much a fairy tale with an improbably happy ending.  Too many events are a little too neat in the end you might say.     I on the other hand would praise it as a fairy tale.  You know fairy tales are written on purpose sometimes.  This one is a fairey tale for adults.     Sure it is sentimental, in the end things turn out improbably good for the main characters.  But fairy tales shine a light on simple good principles.  The story is simple to make the point easily.  The main voice in the story is a faithful dog named Enzo.  The character with the most developed human character most fully fleshed out.  Of course being dog doesn't hurt in a fairy tale.      It some ways it is cliched, but emotionally effective.  Highly recommended.
0385341008|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved the fact that everything I learned I learned through beautifully written letters.  I learned about the people and came to feel like they were old friends.  After I finished the book I went on the internet to learn more about Guernsey and it's occupation by the Nazis.  I also listened to the recorded book and it was wonderful hearing the letters read by different actors.
0545123267|3.0|Okay, I admit it. I'm a recovering twilight-a-holic, so I went into this book expecting to swoon. I almost did. First let me say that the cover is so beautiful and I loved the blue ink. I'm also glad for the author, whose success led to a new paint job for her hot rod. And now onto the book.     Whenever you stop to think about some of these paranormal relationships, it can sometimes get messy. It was a little weird to remember that Edward was over 100 years old and completely infatuated by a sixteen year old. And don't even get me started on Jacob and Nessie. But it seems that Stiefvator jumped into this head on.    Rescued by a wolf (a dog) as a child, Grace is captivated by the pack of wolves she spies in winter. Okay, so far so good. One in particular has mesmerizing yellow eyes. This is where she starts to lose me. Grace is attracted to this yellow eyed wolf in a visceral and inexplicable way. And I was more than a little grossed out about it.    Sam is a great character. And the idea of how he changes from wolf to human is very original (to me) but it's not Grace's attraction to the boy that I feel throughout the book. It's her attraction to the wolf that resonates. And that my dears, creeped me out.     The author could not have written the book much better than she did. She's very talented, but after reading about Grace and Sam and Nessie and Jacob, I'm making the call to try to stick with human on human love and stay away from girls in love with zoo animals. I will still read the sequel to see where she goes with this, but be forewarned. This is about a girl in love with a boy who spends half of his time as a wild dog and she actually digs the smell of fur that he leaves behind. *shivers*
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Once upon a time in the fall of 2004, I went to a YES concert. The opening act was a band I had never heard of, called Dream Theater. Not knowing them, I arrived at the seating area as they were taking their final bows. But over at the cocktail area, I kept noticing a lot of people wearing Dream Theater T-shirts.<br />A month later, I was in a music store browsing, and came upon DT's live @ Boudakan DVD, the day it was released. Remembering the name from the YES show, I thought I'd take a chance and buy it. And ya know, sometimes there are times in life when we just make right decisions, and the decision to buy this DVD changed my musical life FOREVER!<br />I had never been so amazed by a group of musicians (and mind you, I am now 56 years old). Their performances just blew me away. Literally. I was absolutely awe-struck. I couldn't believe the technical perfection and the sheer musical brilliance and genius of this band. Where had I been? Why had I not heard of this band before? Suffice it to say, this DVD opened up a very wide door for me musically. Since that purchase, I have purchased EVERY CD the band has recorded, two more DVD's and seen another concert. As far as I'm concerned, this band is the culmination of every bit of rock and progressive-rock music I have ever enjoyed from the 70's until now. And by the way, of the other DVD's of theirs I own, \\"Boudakan\\" is the best. EVERYTHING about BOTH discs on this DVD is just great. So if you're reading this, get this DVD NOW, or be a LOSER!!!!!!
0439023491|4.0|I loved this. I first learned about The HUnger games when Stephenie Meyer mentioned it on her blog. She was so right. I liked the first one a little better than this one but Catching Fire still delivered.<br /><br />This is the first series that made me happy to be over 20! Suzanne Collins brings back memories of my dad watching Mad Max and the Thunderdome. To think of children being set up in fights like this was a little scary. The violence level of both books makes me a little uncomfortable but you can't say it doesn't hold your attention.<br /><br />It's a heck of a read but definitely read the Hunger Games first or you'll be completely lost!

It's obvious these artists were really 'in the zone' when they recorded and performed this music.<br /><br />It's great CD.  It's great to take a break and get an alternative perspective of our fast paced life and de-stress with this music.  Take five! And buy this CD.

0312370849|4.0|This novel sets up perhaps the most horrific, cruel scenario I've read in connection with the Holocaust.  It somehow even softens the shock of SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  The writing moves with intensity, and I found much of the story to be infused with a romantic, sentimental heart (which weakens it a bit), but overall the story grips you in the character of Sarah, and in her unfathomable life journey. What I loved best about this book is what a stark, brilliant white light it threw onto my own life - and how insignificant the trifles of our daily lives are in comparison to the hideous injustice and terror that destroyed millions of souls a mere 65 years ago.  The Parisian setting and historical backdrop - an unusual and rarely-mentioned audacity underscores the entire story -  adds intrigue and fascination.  You won't soon forget this novel.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I just finished watching FGT for the \\"UPTINTH\\" time..and on SO many levels of life and living that life ..it is so powerful.....first the story is truly amazing by itself but I was told that there was a real sexual relationship in the book between Igbie and Ruth that was ignored in the movie ..hello Hollywood!...anyway...the details of the movie , to me, are amazing...for example,when Ruth dies and Cicely Tyson's character goes through the house covering up portraits and stopping the arm on the \\"big ben\\" clock:I love that history of events that we do not do today....the racial parts of this movie, the homelessness and how they were treated, the depression, who feed them....and then these strong women....it's all encompassing ...you must see this movie as you would see any great movie

B001FB4W0M|3.0|This review is for the Blu-ray edition of Supernatural, Season IV.  I was a little appalled at how it was put together.<br /><br /> 1. The menus have less information than the previous DVD editions of Seasons 1-3.<br /> 2. A long and annoying advertisement for the Blu-ray edition at the beginning was really not needed.  I already shelled out the money for the BR, why are you pitching it to me again?<br /> 3. The menus were confusing.  If you tried the \\"Top Menu\\" button on the remote, it would take you to the extras menu, which does NOT have a link to the regular episodes menu.<br /> 4. The extras were not all hi-def.  This begs the question:  if you are shooting for hi-def, how much extra effort is really needed to produce the extras a tiny bit, just enough so they don't look like a VHS bootleg?<br /><br />For these reasons, and not the plot, the BR version gets 3 stars.  Content is usually more important than form, as long as the form (i.e. state of the art consumer medium) looks more like state of the art consumer media and less like a turd.<br /><br />As far as the content, this season was not very good either.  The show revved up in Seasons 1 through 3 like Dean's Challenger on a highway, and then in Season 4 it just took a side road more suitable for a dirt bike.<br /><br />The overall plot sort of fits within the season's story-arc, but some the individual episodes seemed held together by a piece of gum.  Most of the supporting actors are REALLY BAD.  The new Ruby is stiff.  Chuckles doesn't belong there.  Alistair's second body could not act like the first body.  Anna gets mixed reviews depending on the episode at hand, but is not worth a lot overall.  The saving graces (other than the three amigos) are Uriel, Castiel, and the first Alistair.<br /><br />Oh, and as far as eye candy for the guys, the Lilith in the last episode is the only one that fits nicely with the casting of Seasons 1 through 3 - other than the very brief cameos of some of the casting from previous seasons.

B000YABIQ6|3.0|Mad Men is set in the time period of my parents.  They do a really good job of portraying the attitude towards women and minorities in 1960 and beyond.  People have forgotten what it was like less than 50 years ago. I am glad Mad Men can remind people how far we've come in a very short time and I hope it makes us grateful for the struggles our parents' (or grandparents') generation went through in order for us today to live in work places that should be free of sexual harrassment and racial discrimination - to say nothing of cigarette smoke!      While I love the ambiance of Mad Men, the story itself I find boring.  Certainly the writing is not as crispy as The Sopranos. I watch it for the time travel, not the plot.  Is there a plot?
6304712936|2.0|Great sets and costumes don't redeem almost three hours of enduring a muddled screenplay and poor, often over-the-top, acting by the protagonist and others. A promising beginning deteriorated steadily to a point where I was ready to bail out but somehow stuck with it.     I decided to try this after getting into Mozart the last couple of years. I thought at the least the score would be good. But instead of his concertos, symphonies, and serenades, we get his unfamiliar (to me) operas.     A perfect example of Hollywood rewarding the lushness of the production despite a tiresome (and historically inaccurate) story line.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Having followed music since the 50's, I was a bit smug- confident that I'd at least heard of all those performers whose abilities went beyond those of the one-hit wonders who flashed, crashed and vanished. In spite of my pretensions, I had to admit that I'd never heard of Leonard Cohen and that only a lucky bit of channel-surfing brought him to my attention.     I caught a couple of songs from this DVD on PBS and I was stunned. Leonard looked to be in his seventies (he was) and a master performer- one who gave the audience far more than they paid for and left them thankful they'd been so privileged.     This wonderful DVD showcases Leonard's hits from over 40 years and you can sense that even as he aged, his sheer musical ability allowed him to adapt and present his material with incredible depth and power. This guy will be wowing audiences long after the latest American Idol or You-Tube wonder is not even a memory.

I bought \\"Journey To The Center of The Earth\\" and \\"Polar Express\\" in Blu-ray 3D. Great! Now we are stuck with only the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus Concert 3D's. Yuk!!! Definitely won't buy those! No \\"Bolt\\", No \\"Up\\" no \\"Ice Age - Dawn of The Dinosaurs\\" and probably no \\"G- Force\\" in 3D either. I will not buy any movie not released in 3D as they were in the theaters! If they lose DVD sales, so be it!  After all it was their call!
1423101472|4.0|I would highly recommend this to a large age range (teenager, young adults).  Rick Riordan has created a very captivating scheme of characters and plots.  As soon as I put one book down I was eager to pick up the next.
B000002VCZ|4.0|For someone like me it might come as a surprise I have any interest in the Alan Parsons Project. But there are more than two songs alone that make this album kind of interesting,especially if your a fan of the unexpected.. Alan Parson's sound could very easily represent the whole concept of what I call \\"soft prog\\". One thing to consider in the case of this album was that this particular band had already been there,done that. Even if a lot of it even still was really good that's not where it's at here. Sure it's true that \\"Let's Talk About Me\\",\\"Somebody Out There\\" and \\"Sooner Or Later\\" are pretty typical \\"soft prog\\" tunes really,not all that different from the type of songs Chicago were making during this period,if in fact a bit more cerebral. And that leads into my main point about this album. During the mid 80's there was definately a pervading attitude in the record industry that heavy subjects required heavy music. At least in the R&B world any song that had a poppish conotation was refered to as a \\"fun\\" record. And...well the same thing was happening with rock oriented pop too. This album sure is one of those I imagine everyone might call \\"fun\\" because much of it is either soft or frothy. Fact is this album tackles a lyrical subject matter that was generally being ignored. While any message pop in the 80's seemed to revolve around concepts such as technological overkill and totalitarian societies this one deals with the concept of capitalism vs. communism and....neither concept holds up 100% in the end at all,looking at it from a first person basis as it does here. And considering how the concepts of \\"fun\\" pop message records seemed to begin with R&B there's no irony that two of this albums standout songs have a very strong R&B subtext. \\"Seperate Lives\\" actually has a lite funk flavor,not all that dissimilar to the pop/R&B experiments Level 42 and Culture Club were coming up with,only with a somewhat darker tone than either.The title track is my favorite. It's actually a very good balance between pop/rock and pop/R&B;the jazzy moodiness and sax solo at the beginning leading into a hookey rock refrain in the middle. Saying a little something about the scism between the genres at that time were they? Just maybe they were.There's an instrumental here \\"Hawkeye\\";the lead synthesizer part is very dated but it's still pretty haunting.\\"Days Are Numbers (The Traveller)\\" and \\"The Same Old Sun\\" are again more typical of their sound but also have a pretty nice build to them. Based soley on the conceptualization surrounding this albums theme and two of it's songs this certainly doesn't resemble a whole lot of other music in Alan Parson's catalog. But it will,among other things break open the idea of what \\"fun pop\\" is.favorite.

B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Well it's the Matrix. I don't think the movies themselves need reviews at this point so I just wanted to say that the blu ray transfers on all 3 films is really good.
B00243FQFA|5.0|This is such a fun series; in fact, in some ways I like this series more than SG-1 (which I loved).  It is sure entertainment.  I would recommend the entire series from season 1 - 5.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Excellent album from Prince. Good love songs and the song The dance is classic Prince.  Must Buy                                                                       [[ASIN:B00004Y2QT Prince- Rave un2 The Year 2000]]
B0009XNUK0|3.0|The songs are great but for some reason there are a couple of songs that the sound mixing just didn't come together. The music is too loud and it overpowers Michael Jackson's singing to the point where you can barely hear him at all.
B002CLBJPK|1.0|This review is about the DVD itself. I love this movie and is one of my all time favorites. When it was announced that a new edition was coming, I was very excited because I thougt they will improve the film. I own the 30th anniversary edition and while is not a terrible DVD is also not perfect. My first dissapointment was to know that again it was a single-disc edition. Then, I knew that the new feauterette that looked very exciting (Wizards of Special Effects) was only a way to promote Wizards of Waverly Place. Also no new restoration was added and they even cut a featurette that appeared in the previous DVD. What a shame that Disney could not put out a descent package for this wonderful film, so my recommendation is that if you already own the 30th Ann. Ed., stick with it because this new edition is not woth buying. Let's hope that maybe Disney will deliver us a strong 2-disc set in 2011 when the movie will commemorate its 40th Anniversary.
0143038419|1.0|Possibly the WORST book I have EVER read... Totally self absorbed, narcissistic, a total joke.  Sadly, I thought the beginning and Italy were great, but then it was so, me, me, me..... blah, blah, blah.  Actually, I have never felt compelled to write a review, but if I can save someone the PAIN of reading this piece of JUNK, I hope this helps.  This reminds me of all the women who are always looking for something more, never appreciating what is right in front of them.  I am sure this Author (if you can actually call her that), will go on to have a very rich (in Money) life,  but very poor life, in everything else that matters.    The best thing i can say about this book is, I can ask people if they like it and then take them off my sharing a book  list, and write them down as Vapid, self absorbed people, who can't wait to leave their families, etc....  Don't bother...
0307266303|5.0|Captivating, humorous and yet disjointed writing that all comes together in the end. There is a flow, but you do not see it until the author ties it up in a nice bow in the last few chapters.  This is an inspiring story about the Tarahumara as well as the roots of humankind running from including the \\"how\\" and \\"why\\".  This book will not disappoint.
0385495323|4.0|I think the book is in excellent condition.  Very pleased with both the book and the vendor.  Price was right and delivery was very quick.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|The kind of movies that I usually watch are Terminator, Actions, with a lot of mature themes, etc.      I rented this movie just to check it out of curiosity about why gals like Hannah Montana so much.    Best movie that I ever saw and although Miley or Hannah doesn't have the best voice in the business, she uses the most of her talents.    Like everyone says, this movie rocks!  By the way, I'm almost 50.
B001GCUO4I|2.0|I know why \\"The Final Destination\\" was released in 3-D. It's to distract you from the fact that you're being told the exact same story all over again, only with new characters and a plot stripped so bare that the word \\"simple\\" hardly begins to describe it. What started as a clever and frightening idea back in 2000 has grown tiresome and derivative, and while it isn't quite campy, it definitely takes itself less seriously. I think I heard more laughing in the audience with this film than I did watching \\"The Ugly Truth.\\" Consider an early scene in which a couple of boys cover their ears to shut out loud racetrack noises; their mother provides them with tampons to use as earplugs. Another scene late in the film shows a man trying but failing to hang himself: \\"I've been trying to kill myself all day!\\" he whines, after which he goes through a list of other failed suicide attempts.    Of course, the 3-D process itself is the majority of the problem. Apparently, death scenes are lot funnier when objects come directly at you. That definitely explains shots of a man's head getting impaled, a golf ball whizzing through a woman's eye socket, and a tire flying through the air before decapitating a young woman. Never mind the horror of it all; if you're in the right mood, you will be in for a good laugh.    In \\"The Final Destination,\\" the fourth in the series, an equally hapless group of young people find themselves in a frantic struggle against Death. When attending a racecar event with his friends, the burdened Nick O'Bannon (Bobby Campo) suddenly and inexplicably has a premonition that a car accident will kill many people in the arena, himself included. Panicked, he causes a fuss and gets himself and his friends kicked out of the arena, along with a select group of people. Lo and behold, there's an accident, and many people are killed. That should be the end of it, but hold on--it now seems that Death is going through the accident survivors one by one and picking them off. Nick foresees every event, naturally, although he can't quite make out who the event is intended for. That changes when he remembers his initial vision; through a process too inconsequential to describe, he determines the order in which each survivor will die.    It now becomes a matter of Nick breaking the chain and stopping Death in its tracks. But how? His supportive but rattled girlfriend, Lori (Shantel VanSanten) doesn't seem to know, and neither do his callous friend, Hunt (Nick Zano), and his skeptical girlfriend, Janet (Haley Webb). Maybe George Lanter, the race track security guard (Mykelti Williamson), will be able to help Nick figure something out. But they had better hurry; the list of survivors is dwindling fast, and Nick and his friends are next.    Usually, I provide a plot description first and then get into the deeper aspects of the story, such as characterization and theme. In the case of \\"The Final Destination,\\" the plot is the extent of the film's depth. You want to know about Nick, Lori, Hunt, and Janet? Look no further than what I said in the previous two paragraphs. The actors in this movie weren't hired to play human beings; they were hired to mindlessly stand in a scene and wait for their cue to die a horrible death. Think of it in terms of Sid from the original \\"Toy Story\\": He saw toys not as prized possessions but as worthless objects, and he liked to destroy them just for the fun of it. Destruction, I admit, can be fun, especially in a horror film. But when all you have at your disposal are drones that have absolutely no life to them, there's no sense of fun or entertainment. There's only a sense of emptiness.    That being said, I realize I haven't said much about the 3-D process. I'll say this much: It achieves what it set out to achieve. This is especially true of the opening and closing credit sequences, which feature animated x-ray images of people being killed in all sorts of nasty ways. Bones break. Teeth shatter and fly right at you. Skullcaps get sliced off. A drill bit seems to be aimed right at our heads. Does this sound appealing to you? If so, fine. If not, be aware that it's probably the best the movie has to offer in the way of cool graphic imagery. Not even a carwash mishap or a movie theater explosion, both effective, have the same power and punch. And shots of Death manipulating objects to cause a disaster stopped being clever a long time ago.    Why are they making more of these movies? Didn't the first one say everything that needed to be said? The insinuation is that \\"The Final Destination\\" is the last in the series, but I've repeatedly observed that the word \\"final\\" is meaningless when it comes to a popular horror franchise (\\"Friday the 13th\\" used it twice, and they were proven wrong both times). If the 3-D process is the only way left to make this idea fresh and exciting, if the purpose is no longer to be scary but to film a series of gory death scenes, if the actors are given roles with no depth, then it's probably time to let go and move on to something else. Even Death needs a break from time to time.
0307408833|3.0|I bought this book mainly for the vegan aspect, not primarily for gluten-free recipes.  I know a lot of the other reviews complained that all of the recipes are not gluten-free which seems inconsistent with the title of the book.  However, the book contains some really wonderful recipes that make this a valuable resource for anyone who wants to eat without gluten, eggs and/or dairy.  My children have gobbled up treats I have made from this book and as most people know, kids tend to be super picky about their snacks.  I also made the brownies and took them to my office and they were devoured.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I haven't made the cupcakes yet, but based on the other reviews, I will do it with caution and low expectations.  The book contains beautiful pictures which make it a fun cookbook to read.
0312370849|5.0|I just finished Sarah's Key and it is a good thing that I was home on vacation when I picked it up yesterday. I had been putting off reading it because I am not too interested in reading books about war, but after the first few pages, Sarah and her brother's plight had caught me and I just could not put the book down. At midnight I had to quit but at first light I jumped out of bed and finished the last two chapters before breakfast. This book is a 10/10 and is going in my permanent collection. I will read this book many times and lend it to friends. It is more about secrets, lies, forgiveness, giving, forgiving and letting in the light of day than about a war. It is a story that is told many times, over many centuries, in many countries, but Ms. Rosnay has done an extraordinary job of the telling. This book will stick with me for a very long time.
B002DYKP8S|1.0|Let's get one thing out of the way: This is an excellent wuxia movie and by now, there is little point to cover what is so great about the movie itself - almost everyone who is reading this review has almost certainly already watched it.    Unfortunately, this movie's debut on the BD format really suffers and disappoints diehard Asian movie fans like me because some jerk at Miramax (who needs to be fired) royally SCREWED UP and made the decision to encode the ludicrous English-dub audio track in the lossless 5.1 DTS HDMA format, while the original Mandarin track that any self-respecting fan would prefer is in the crappy (and lossy) Dolby Digital 5.1 format.     Whether this was an honest mistake or done out of ignorance or as a racist sentiment on Miramax's part is irrelevant. What matters is that true fans are screwed because of this decision. I am really mad at Miramax and given their history of treating Asian movies like dirt (and yes, it is a LONG history), I think I am done buying anything from this company. This was the last straw for me.          Edit: typo: added \\"ruined\\" to title because it was bugging the hell out of me...

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to admit, I was a little skeptical as to how I was going to get a shredded body by doing a workout that only takes 20 minutes. How intense can a brief workout really be? Answer: very intense!     As she mentions during the workout, she makes some big promises with this DVD and in order to deliver, she works you non-stop at an intense level for every bit of that 20 minutes for three full circuits. I found myself struggling to keep up and wishing that 20 minutes was up even before the second circuit began. It was that intense.    Skipping any sort of water break entirely, Jillian systematically goes through each circuit incorporating cardio, weight training and ab work with great precision. Just when you thought it was intense, you start all over and do the same circuit again. You have the option of choosing your level (1, 2 or 3) and only need 3 lb. hand weights, as was used in her other workout DVD, No More Trouble Zones. Believe me, 3 lbs. is plenty!    I liked that I really felt my entire body was being worked and nothing was left out with this series. From my arms to my legs, everything was on fire by the time it was all over. Though I'm not as sore from this workout as I was from No More Trouble Zones, I still felt like I got an intense workout on a day where I really didn't have the time for a full workout. It's nice to have the option for a quick, intense workout by popping in this DVD. I started out on Level 2 and had difficulty keeping up; I should've listened to Jillian and started on Level 1!    Overall, I would recommend this DVD. It's brief but intense and allows you to progressively pick up the intensity while not taking up much time.
0307454541|5.0|Finding it impossible to put down, I read Stieg Larsson's Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in two days.  Larsson's characters sprang to life on the pages and the story line was riddled with suspense. Larsson's familiarity with information technology added to the story and kept it remarkably current. A remarkably good story any way you look at it.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|The best thing about this pacifier, is that during the night, when all other pacifiers get lost or pushed out of the crib, this one is easy for my baby to find.  I have two and put both in his crib.  He finds it easily during the night and most times wakes up in the morning, still sucking on it!
1601251505|1.0|This 3.5 clone does only cosmetic changes on the 3.5 rules. It doesn't resolve any of the major flaws 3.5 has and the DM burden remains the same (heavy).<br /><br />Besides spending money there is no point in acquiring this book. Your 3.5 books are just as good.<br /><br />The only thing carrying sales is the usual nerd rage when D&D releases a new version. Once the shiny wears off, all you have is another niche company offering another clone from the scraps off WOTC's table.<br /><br />Perhaps companies should actually be creative and make new ground rules instead of re-hashing discarded game mechanics from other companies.<br /><br />Pretty pictures and layout don't cover that fact that this still the same flawed 3.5 system with a few (and in some cases) over complicated changes.<br /><br />Save your money.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Really liked the Documentary. Have watched 3 disc so far and all are amazingly mind-blowing. Great Picture quality and very organized presentation.

B00009MGGI|5.0|Anyone who has read the other excellent reviews knows already how fantastically Ian Richardson inhabits the role of Machiavellian prince in this wonderful trilogy (yes, the third disk is the weakest, but that's only in comparison to the first two). Shakespearean (and other literary) allusions are woven beautifully through all three, including of course Richard III, Macbeth, but also extending to other plays like Othello and Troilus and Cressida. This is a brilliant, funny, compelling series.    All I can add is to say that American audiences can too appreciate the sophistication of this drama, which seems in doubt for some of the other reviewers. We may not thrill to the portrayal of the royal family quite as much or get all the nuances of tension between the House of Lords and the House of Commons; but we are not complete dolts.
B0029LHWIQ|4.0|My little girl loves curious george and really loves to read these books!  We love that they are just the right size & durable board books!  My only complaint is the stories are poorly written & \\"old george\\"...not the new updated looking george from the pbs cartoon.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|For some musicians, their concert hall is the street, their audience is the foot traffic, and they play for coins. This video brings the greatest hits of a number of such artists into your home, from all over the world. I found it inspired and charming, and with its montage of artists in various locations singing Bob Marley's \\"One Love/Let's Get Together\\", it surprised me with the discovery that I really like reggae. I love that the producer showcased the distinctive, melodic singing of Zulu performers, and I revelled in the freshness of authentic recreations of \\"the people's music\\" by singers from Santa Monica to Israel and the Far East. This presentation touched and delighted my heart.
B000UTZ510|5.0|I happened upon the movie \\"Once\\" recently and loved it so much I regretted having to return it to the video store.  Then I rented it again so that I could share the experience with my daughter, who also loved it.  The music stayed with me and I decided I must have the recorded soundtrack.  Luckily, I found it here on Amazon and have been playing it in my car ever since!
0394492196|4.0|This book is written more as a slow, psychological spy novel as opposed to what you might find in today's typical spy novel.  It that sense it is more realistic which you would expect coming from a writer who spent many years working for British intelligence.  This is the kind of story that is told in a way that you really believe could have happened.  If you are a fan of this genre, I think you'll find this book one of the best of its kind.  For others, you might find some of the terminology and dialogue a little confusing.  Definitely worth the read.
B001LF347E|4.0|I confess that when I first heard of this BBC import I had no intention of watching it. For starters, it deviated too far from the standard Arthurian legends. And when I heard about CG dragons and pseudo-medieval costuming I decided it would be a total dud.    I couldn't have been more wrong. The series is absolutely delightful, in spite of minor flaws like occasionally sketchy plots and dialogue. It was clearly aimed at young viewers--perhaps the early to mid-teen set--but surprise, surprise! It has garnered a devoted adult following, to which I now belong. A lot of this is due to the charm of the (mostly youthful) cast, a bunch of attractive newcomers who overcome the periodic silliness of the storylines with their genuine acting chops and ability to swashbuckle with just the right amount of aplomb combined with humor. A degree of gravitas is provided by Richard Wilson as the court physician Gaius and Anthony Head as a narrow-minded, stern (nay, hard-assed!) King Uther Pendragon, and John Hurt, who voices the clairvoyant old dragon chained beneath Uther's castle at Camelot. But the lead actors--Colin Morgan as young Merlin and Bradley James as Prince Arthur--undoubtedly steal the show.    In this non-conventional take on Camelot, Prince Arthur is something of an arrogant bully with a heart of gold, who becomes genuinely fond of and dependant upon Merlin, the gawky, bumbling, admittedly adorable youth he takes as a manservant. What he doesn't yet know is that Merlin is a gifted sorcerer, who must conceal his abilities because King Uther has outlawed (on pain of death) the practice of any form of magic. In spite of the royal ban, it is Merlin's destiny--as Gaius and the imprisoned dragon repeatedly assure him--to look after Arthur, protect him from harm, and make certain that he survives the sniping of his enemies to become king of Camelot someday. The job isn't always a picnic; Arthur can be a pain in the royal butt at times, and his prowess as a warrior places himin constant danger. Merlin (whose blue eyes turn CG gold when he performs magic) is periodically aided by other inhabitants of Camelot, most specifically Morgana (Katie McGrath), Uther's beautiful ward, and Guinevere, known as Gwen (Angel Coulby), who is Morgana's maid. All in all the cast appears to to having a grand old time with this morphed rendition of the King Arthur story, and they clearly have an excellent chemistry with one another. As the New York Times quipped, this is Camelot in the Age of Obama: commoners and nobles address each other by their first names and Guinevere is a servant, not a princess, and is played by a lovely actress of mixed ethnic background. Best of all, Merlin and Arthur are perfect foils for one another in looks and in character. The slim, angular Mr. Morgan, with his lanky grace, black hair, elvish ears and changeable blue eyes gives us a Merlin who is by turns comical, serious, and intense, shy yet self-assertive in the face of Arthur's bullying. Mr. James, a classically handsome blond with mobile features, pouty rock-and-roll lips, and an athletic physique, plays Arthur as a spoiled princeling with a sense of entitlement, who nevertheless clearly cares about his subjects and hides a kindness and compassion beneath an arrogant exterior.    As the mother of a teenager who adores the show, it has been a (guilty) pleasure for me to watch this series unfold. I look forward to a second season. When a U.S.-compatible DVD set is issued, I hope it includes the cast's video diaries from the British DVD release. These \\"diaries,\\" which contain some hilarious escapades (both on and off set) featuring the young actors, as well as moments of highly amusing banter between Mr. James and Mr. Morgan, and Mr. James and Ms. Coulby, are definitely worth a watch.
B00005JPS8|4.0|I Loved this movie - The CG animation, script and characters make this movie a highly enjoyable must have for people who enjoy action movies. Marvel did a brilliant job bringing their comics to life and Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job as Tony Stark.    The story is engaging, funny and fast-paced. The deleted scenes and extras make the special edition a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection.
B00132D808|5.0|Panic at the Disco's Pretty. Odd. was what validated the band for me. While Panic's previous album, their debut A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, alluded to some actual talent and skill in terms of interesting and profound lyrics and musical compositions, their musical ability has been proven by ditching Fever's techno vibes, Palahniukian themes, and angst-driven lyrics, and replacing them with baroque Beatle's homage of brass and string that encompasses the wider range of musical excursions in  Pretty. Odd.      The much more sophisticated album has proven Panic at the Disco to be, as my dad says, `music you don't hear anymore'. Which I take to mean good music. Showcasing their musical range with songs that could fit into a myriad of different genre's including Pas De Cheval's edgier rock feel, to the nearly bluegrass Folkin' Around, Panic! showcases an abundance of ability to draw inspiration from and create fun, original songs.      The album starts off with We're So Starving, a brief minute-long song that the band felt to be a fun way to say, quote; `we're so sorry we've been gone.' Referring to the two year gap between A Fever and Pretty. Odd. It's a short, catchy little number that eases you into the more upbeat vibe.      Following We're So Starving is their first single, the hit Nine In The Afternoon. Singer Brendon Urie's vocals are, as always, impressively smooth in this 60's inspired ode to psychedelics. With a catchy chorus, and interesting melody of horns, strings, and piano, it's no wonder why Nine In The Afternoon was such a hit.      The third song is a personal favorite of mine, She's A Handsome Woman. In what I think is some of guitarist/lyricist's Ryan Ross' best work, a non-sequiturs and very poetic song littered with wonderful imagery tells of `sheepish wolves', `beat-back bones', and `jealous orchard's. The song is accentuated with a very sensual drum beat, and addictive guitar riff.     Do You Know What I'm Seeing? is the Pretty. Odd.'s fourth song, and one of the more `Odd.' songs of the album. Written by bassist Jon Walker and front man Brendon Urie, the lyrics noticeably lack the articulate touch of Ross' writing, but the song doesn't suffer much because of it. Swaying you in with a slow and slightly skewed string intro, the ambivalent theme of the simplistic lyrics fits perfectly with the slow, simple, and slightly-off ballad.      That Green Gentleman [Things Have Changed.] was the second single off the album, and a very popular one at that. An upbeat, very lively song represents an overall theme of the album, singing of coming to terms with change. It's sung in a lyrically intricate way, Urie's vocals perfectly accenting Ross' amusing lyrics. The easy and unpretentious song is definitely one you'll find yourself bobbing your head too, and in fair time singing along to once you hear the very first note.      I Have Friends In Holy Spaces is definitely one of the less serious of the album. One of the few songs written by Brendon Urie, the lyrics are boring and repetitive. The saving grace is that the song is only a minute long, and the music behind the lyrics is very retro-themed, giving the song an overall `good' feeling to it. Brief and fun, Panic has even referred to it as just `a little ditty'.      Northern Downpour, a sweet, gentle, `intimate' song is a beautifully written piece of poetic genius. The bass is particularly powerful in this song that proves to be a  complete one-eighty from A Fever. The lyrics graciously flow in this light and easy song, and less pretentiously than their previous album`s showy, over the top elements of teenage angst and self-centeredness. Memorable lines including `then we should feed our jewelry to the sea, for diamonds do appear to be just like broken glass to me.', and `I know the world's a broken bone, but melt your headaches call it home.'.         When The Day Met The Night is a song you won't soon forget. Beginning with a powerful string intro, you're taken intoa delightful piece with an amazing orchestral and brass composition. The lyrics are less profound and more of a `fun' nature, and fittingly so. One of the few love songs Panic has done, it's truly one of the most beautiful.         The Piano Knows Something I Don't Know is a very mature piece of music. It begins with a flute intro that goes into a slow and attention-commanding stanza that breaks into a lively baroque rock riff. The lyrics are deep in a very amusing fashion, they're very witty and manage to drive a lot into a three-minute song. It really creates its own sound, a very different type of music structurally than you would expect from Panic at the Disco. It's interesting and refreshing.         Behind The Sea is a Beatles-esque acoustic song. For a rare occasion, Ryan Ross sings this one. Chock full of melodic imagery, the song offers a voice with a bit of a rawer sound than Urie's, giving the song a more personal touch.  The percussion fuels this song that sings of marching drums behind the sea. The natural sound and thoughtful lyrics give the song a lot of personality.        Folkin' Around is another song written by Urie, and again, the lyrics don't hold much light in comparison to the rest of the songs on the album.  However, it is again a very short and fun song. The sound completely adapts to the folk aspect, with a great fiddle and banjo. The song itself is ironic and intentionally exaggerated, and you can really feel a sense of pride and particular attachment in Urie's singing of it.      She Had The World is the thirteenth track of the album. The overwhelming sense of delicacy from the orchestra and whimsical sense from the harpsichord, sets up this romantic piece. An interesting assortment of Urie and Ross' respectively unique voices truly gives shape to the song. The bridge is a wonderful melody that has a tranquil mood to it.      From The Mountain In The Middle Of The Cabins is another one of my personal favorites. The song has a very retrofeel to it, as if you were playing a record. The beat is absolutely amazing in it's simplicity and in combination with the powerful horns and subservient strings, it's the perfect harmonious backdrop for Urie's spot-on vocals working Ross' lyrics, in which the imagery and theme are beautiful and not disappointing in the least. The song's bridge includes whistling, which adds a great deal of personality and charm. The song leaves you with a great feeling of being carefree.     Mad As Rabbits ends the album with a fun and quirky song. A fast paced song with a solid beat, Mad As Rabbits again combines the unique combination of Urie and Ross' voices. The lyrics are entertaining, quick and witty. The chorus is a melodic little piece that let's the horns carry it out into the more rhythmic verses. The very last line of the song says `We must reinvent love', a line famously attached to the band.      I give Panic at the Disco's Pretty. Odd. a 5/5 because it delivered on every promise of talent and thought that their first album hinted at. Pretty. Odd.'s musical diversity is a brilliant testament to Panic's growth as a band. It's mature, thoughtful, beautiful, unique and inspired. All in all, it's simply a very good album.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|The Police were one of the best rock trios period. Sting played the bass and flowed his lyrics. Andy Summers filled tracks up with his playing. Sometimes it sounded like two lead guitars. Let's not forget my man Stewart Copeland. I have never enjoyed listening to drummers much before him. This guy had some sick fills. One of my favorites was on Driven To Tears at the break at the end of the song. Listen to it and you will hear for yourself. My only regret is not seeing them perform live.

B0010358CQ|3.0|A new take on the Appleseed story. This anime does NOT follow on from any of the other Appleseed stories and is instead a new take on it.     The CG animation is impressive, the story fun and enjoyable, the fight scenes brilliant. This is a good addition for your collection if you enjoy futureistic, sci-fi animes. I actually enjoyed the story more than in the original Appleseed.
B002CPD5LM|3.0|Wow, there's no doubt that someone pulled out all the stops to produce this concert. The lineup of stars, from Petula Clark to Herbie Hancock is incredible. They are backed up by a first-rate rhythm section of seasoned American musicians and a big band comprised of young Swiss(?) players that does a very credible job. The music is wonderful too, with updated but familiar arrangements of Quincy Jones classics.    Unfortunately, the problem with this disc is in the recording. You'd think with this much money invested, and probably $100k of expensive microphones visible onstage, that they could have gotten it right. But they didn't... I listened to the DTS-HD Master soundtrack and was very disappointed, especially with the lead vocals. Maybe it was use of the wireless mics or the venue, but the lead vocals consistently sounded like they were coming from the next room. (muffled tone, more and/or different reverb than the rest of the band, not loud enough) It was bad enough that it very much detracted from my enjoyment of the concert. Too bad.

B001QWBM62|5.0|OK, to qualify this review I need to state that this is the first multitrack recorder I've ever purchased, so I don't have enough experience to compare this to other devices.  That said, the sound quality I get when I use this device is simply amazing!  The frequency response is so flat that, to me, the recording sounds identical to the sound being recorded.  I used this to record a friend's meditation bell and when I played it back through the soeaker, she asked me whether it was the bell she was hearing or the recording.  The sound stage when listening through earbuds is equally transparent.  I actually feel like I'm right there, even when I mix down to 16 bit audio and encode it as 320kb MP3.  The menus and controls are easy to operate and don't get in the way of what I'm trying to do.  I am very happy I purchased this product.

B000001ELP|3.0|kiss,s; music from the elder album was released in late 1981. this album followed the ;unmasked album from 1980 which was one of the first kiss albums that did,nt do as well as  the previous releases had.music from the elder was the first album to feature new drummer eric carr.after dynasty and unmasked ace frehley wanted kiss to do a return roots album,however the band hooked up with producer bob ezrin who had produced such albums as kiss,s;destroyer and pink floyd,s;the wall album.bob ezrin convinced gene and paul to do a concept album and to experiment with a different sounds than kiss was used to doing.ace frehley did not like this idea!!! when it became clear that this project was not going to be the return to hard rock that ace wanted, ace became disgruntled..and later said that he contributed great guitar parts to the elder sessions that were cut out of the final recording.when ace heard the finished album he claims he took the cassette and smashed it against a wall.though the elder has some good moments i believe ace frehley was correct when he said he told gene and paul he thought doing the elder album would be a mistake. it turned out that; music from the elder at the time of it,s release did not do well,in fact kiss never toured for the album at the time and rarely if ever played any songs from it live until the mtv unplugged reunion in 1996.as a kiss fan i would definately get it.the best cuts in my opinion are;I,the oath,world with-out heroes,dark light and under the rose.
B00003CXB4|3.0|We bought this DVD after it'd been locked in Disney's idiotic vault.  We paid through the teeth for it but we wanted our son to not grow up without being able to enjoy such a great movie.  The DVD was obviously produced outside of Disney's system.  The dvd case and label on the DVD just wasn't quite professional.  I'm surprised that these folks are able to get away with it!  Still the quality when watching is good and though I pride myself on not stealing music, movies or anything else without the proper people being paid it serves Disney right for locking these movies up and not letting people that would love to purchase legitimate copies to do so.
0061564893|5.0|Menzies advances a startling and truly earth shattering proposition: that not only did the Chinese discover America before Columbus, but they discovered the rest of the world - Antarctica, Australia - charted it, sailed to or near the poles, and figured out longitude. And they not only brought Chinese artifacts, animals and plants to the New World, they brought American ones back to Southeast Asia and China itself.<br /><br />Menzies isn't the only person working on this, and apparently the field has gotten a lot bolder the last few years, with a number of scholars, particularly but not only Chinese ones, marshalling the evidence.<br /><br />It's a huge undertaking, the rewriting of world history, and it properly should take a while. Any page in this book might properly occupy a scholar for a year in nailing down the facts, verifying the information, and mulling it through in light of the huge chain of events that Menzies proposes.<br /><br />He's not starting from a blank slate: the Zheng He voyages and Chinese technological prowess of the time are historical fact, as is China's xenophobic reaction destroying all traces of them a few years later. The debate is where Zheng He's enormous fleet went, why and what they left behind. Menzies puts the ball squarely in the critics' court; he has given too much evidence to have it blithely dismissed.<br /><br />Menzies himself says his book would properly have been several times as long if he'd written in the accepted scholarly fashion, and you can see that's true. Often you want more underpinnings of everything he says. Is this fact true? Is it accepted? Who accepts it? Who doesn't, and why?<br /><br />But he can't be found guilty of facile treatment of all this. His work on the map and navigation side of this - his strong suit as a former mariner who navigated by the stars in the days before GPS - is truly stunning. He reasons through the anomalies on old European maps - ones apparently showing the Americas, the Cape of Good Hope, the coast of Africa or the Caribbean islands before Europeans arrived at these places, or could have mapped them in such detail. And projecting the Chinese fleet's reach to so many places, including up rivers deep into continents' hearts, he goes about searching for evidence of their presence, and finds a lot of it. Much of it remains to be better examined than he could here; actually, the amount of information and worldwide sweep of this is remarkable as it is.<br /><br />This turns out notion of the world's history upside down. He suggests the Chinese are ethnic ancestors of various Indian tribes and helped spread flora and fauna around the world. He suggests Magellan and Columbus knew where they were going because they were following Chinese-derived maps. But Menzies' work is interesting in yet another, ultramodern way. This book's ongoing work is being done on the Internet, as thousands of emails solicited by Menzies asking for useful information have poured in. Much of it won't pan out, but some probably will.<br /><br />If this theory becomes accepted fact, historians may have to answer for why so many unusual facts went so unexamined for so long. Reports of Chinese people and Chinese settlements in the Americas, the presence of Chinese-speaking Indians, remains and other evidence of horses - who died out here 10,000 years ago but then were found here by the Europeans - and unusual ruins that couldn't be attributed to native populations, like the Bimini Road or the Round Tower in Newport, R.I. Were historians asleep at the wheel?<br /><br />I do dread the use of this in the PC wars as yet another tool with which to bash dead European white males, but no matter. If it's the truth, so be it. And the dead European white males put a lot on the line to rediscover a world that the Chinese, if they discovered it in fact, then turned their backs on.<br /><br />Really, though, this all ought to be the subject of years of examination before people come down onone side of it or the other. Some of the shipwrecks Menzies mentions ought to be more heavily examined. Botanists and zoologists need to weigh in on his observations about plants and animals found, early, on the wrong side of oceans. Historians expert in one or another aspect of pre-Columbian history, as well as the Age of Exploration and Chinese history, ought to give this some serious thought. They will attack this, as they should, but they shouldn't reject it out of hand.ought to be more heavily examined.

B00111YM5G|4.0|... So I gave this 4 out of 5 stars though if I wasn't such a sucker for these types of dark and stylistic pieces, I would have given 3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />\\"You threw me far from Grace. Now I fall unto it.\\" - Gabriel<br /><br />I had a hard time rating this film. First off, it seems as if it should be horrible; or at least cheesy and over done. But it's not. It's spectacular. In the tradition of such movies as [[ASIN:B000V6LSL8 Night Watch / Day Watch (Two-Movie Collection)]], [[ASIN:B0008ENI0W Immortal]], and [[ASIN:B000059XUO The Crow (Miramax/Dimension Collector's Series)]], 'Gabriel' makes up for any plot deficiencies with style and grit. In short, I think it deserves the title Cult Classic in every way :)<br /><br />The story is this: the \\"Arc Angel\\" Gabriel has been sent down to Purgatory - a dark city styled much like that created for 'The Crow' - to fight against the Fallen (who control the city). He is the last hope of the Light and has more than just Fallen to worry about. He's been sent down in human form, and for the first time in his existence, must battle to understand the new emotions that go along with his existence: fear, hate, anger, sorrow and even love.<br /><br />The premise is your standard Good versus Evil, and the idea that Purgatory is city where \\"Arcs\\" and \\"Fallen\\" battle for the souls is bit unbelievable. Much of the dialogue is also standard and expected, considering the premise - but for whatever reason, in this case the combination works perfectly.<br /><br />Stylistically 'Gabriel' is a masterpiece. From camera angles and lighting to visual effects and soundtrack, the film is a wonderfully dark abstraction. Andy Whitfield embodies the role of the conflicted archangel Gabriel - his nuanced and soulful performance bringing heartfelt believability to his character; even in moments that would normally be unparalleled in their cheesiness. All of actors, in fact, shine within their roles, though I will admit, I especially liked Harry Pavlidis performance as the Arc Uriel.<br /><br />The creators' theatrical influences definitely shone through as well. One scene at the very beginning reminded me of the moment in Brandon Lee's 'The Crow' where Draven is stumbling down the street when a bunch of children run circles around him - able to 'trick or treat' on Halloween for the first time since the gangs took over. There were other throwback scenes like that one, and I loved that the filmmakers payed homage to their inspirations in such a way - without interrupting the flow at all.<br /><br />A note on the American release: for whatever reason the international (or possibly just the U.S.) release has a different ending than the original Australian version. Not to spoil, but the original edit made things a lot clearer, and I prefer it. The U.S. edit is a step too abstract and implies the wrong thing in my opinion. However, it is purported that 'Gabriel' is the first of of a trilogy - the second and third parts to be released at an unknown date in the future - so maybe the end of the first will be worked out at a some other time. Personally, I hope that's sooner rather than later :)<br /><br />Also, the website ([...]) and Facebook ([...]) pages are a real treat and worth checking out if you interested in connecting with other fans, or just looking at what went into this film, and what is to come in the trilogy.The creators' theatrical influences definitely shone through as well.

0375703764|5.0|Mark Z. Danielewski's incredible first novel remains beyond classification or genre placement. This might be because - beyond showing an incredible talent at post-modern storytelling - the story has a lot going on. Most notably: 1)a small time tattoo artist's discovery of an almost academic monograph called The Navidson Record, 2) written by a blind man named Zampan&ograve;, 3)about a nonexistent documentary film about a photojournalist who finds a house that has some disturbing quirks. For one, the house is bigger on the intside than it is on the outside, with a mysterious hallway that shouldn't exist and continuously changes shape. Woven between this layering of narrators, Danielewski packs in footnotes, poems, scientific lists, collages, Polaroids, appendices of fake correspondence and \\"various quotes\\"; single lines of prose or sometimes single words on a page, and even crossed-out passages.<br /><br />While this story may seem, at first, to be too broken to induce actual fear in the reader, the story within unfolds in such a way that the reader can not help but grow unsettled. Because of this, the closest classification I can think of would be \\"psychological thriller,\\" though that is hardly all inclusive. Each interwoven story has a different taste, almost comparable to spices in a complex soup.<br /><br />The first time I read this book, I couldn't put it down - I was almost frantic at some moments, flipping wildly through the pages with few words and turning the book upside down to read other passages.  'House of Leaves' is a full blown experience, one that not only left me breathless, but also with a vague sense of unease.  It was hard to resist the impulse of tacking measuring tape all over my walls :)<br /><br />This novel is not for everyone. The story lines are disjointed, and there are a few chapters that really slow down before the spectacular intensity of the finish. There are also a number of fairly violent scenes, that, while not overly graphic, are still hard to stomach. Not a story to read to the kids! My only other suggestion would be to get the full color edition. It's the best way to grasp the full experience of Danielewski's incredible vision.o read to the kids!

I have always wanted to be a writer, so it is kind of strange to find someone who does two things that I love like that.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|Honestly, I rented this from Netflix and every time I thought I was ready to send it back, it ended up staying so that I could watch it \\"just one more time.\\" I will be buying it.  There are lots of highlights, but the performance of Beat It is out of this world. Imagine a live band and awesome background vocals, plus MJ's seemingly unending energy.  It's astounding that this was one of the last cities he visited on the tour and still the energy and performances are top-notch. Very little lip-synching from what I can tell.  His voice is deeper than usual on many songs, but just as smooth. It's true that he was a perfectionist and he also is engaged on an emotional level in every song on this set.  Slash does not perform in this concert, as is suggested in the first reviewer. Also enjoyed Man in the Mirror, Thriller, Smooth Criminal.  Two songs were a bit disappointing - Human Nature and Wanna Be Startin Something.  However, after those two songs he hit everyone out of the ballpark.  On several of the songs, the James Brown style comes through.  Wish I could have seen it in person, but I am sure it would have been nearly impossible to get such a good seat!
0307454541|4.0|The well-drawn Lisbeth  Salander character alone is worth reading this book; she's one of the best original female characters I have come across in a long time.  The truth is, I couldn't stop reading this novel from the very beginning despite the uncomfortable feeling that I was back in school trying to memorize generations of names, dates and events and that if I didn't succeed, I was going to flunk.  The author, Steig Larsson actually had an interesting book going (International business intrigue, historical Swedish setting, mystery, romance, technology), but then he got OTT (over the top) \\"sensational\\" with the story line. Perhaps the author, like so many pop authors, indulged in the extreme (not to give it away) to smack the hands of those of us who had already neatly ordered the general themes, characters, and events long before the middle of the book.  (Even the opening mystery event in the first few pages!)  Too bad Larsson succumbed to the temptation, he could have made a better shorter book without getting bazaar and we would have loved him for it. Unfortunately, despite the very few ending paragraphs about Salander, which  I thought realistic and satisfying, the last third--the resolution of the book--can best be described as commercial.  A good but flawed beach read.  I'm giving it a 4 star \\"beach-read\\" rating in honor of Ms. Lisbeth Salander.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Two of the best female contemporary voices today are featured on this original cast soundtrack. Chenowith gives sparkle to Glinda the Good Witch's role while Menzel is a powerhouse delivering knockout after knockout as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch. In this mostly Pre-Dorothy story, we learn how the two witches met at school, became friends, and then broke apart.      Okay, admittedly the music is pithy and has a bit more pop sentiment than I'd like, but the two women manage to deliver their character to the songs that makes this soundtrack listenable long past the time you've seen the play and stopped wearing the t-shirt.  \\"Defying Gravity\\" is definitely a new favorite song of mine and I suspect I will still be playing the soundtrack until the sequel \\"Son of a Witch\\" gets its Broadway debut.     Will you get as much out of the soundtrack if you have not seen the play?  I don't think so. The memories for me add a lot more luster to the music, but I think you will still enjoy the soundtrack. At least, give the individual samples a listen and decide for yourself.     Rebecca Kyle, September 2009

B002JYPV3G|5.0|I'm 24 now and have been a huge Slipknot fan when they 1st came out 10 years ago with this cd. This is actually the 4th time i've bought this disk (the 1st two versions one with 'purity\\", the other with \\"me inside\\", and then the digipak version) and this is hands down the one to own, if you don't own a version already.                                                                                              To those wondering if it's worth getting all over again, I will tell you YES! 1st off for me, I had let someone borrow my copy with Purity on it a couple years back and i never got it back from them, so for that song alone, im pretty happy. You also get their entire demo pretty much and the demo version of \\"wait and bleed\\" is really cool to listen to with the variation of vocals by the then younger Corey Taylor.  The disk is 25 tracks long, with the original only being 14/15 counting \\"eeyore\\". Also to let it be known, you don't have to listen to minutes of silence and everyone throwing up before you get to eeyore. It's now a separate track, minus the long intro which is awesome.                                                                                             Now the DVD: (sic)!!! Comes with what felt like an hour long video of behind the scenes and rare concert footage. Look a Corey's hair back in the day, pretty damn funny and i'm sure even he gets a kick out of that. Also Joey Jordison IS the best drummer alive (my educated opinion). Also you get the videos \\"spit it out\\", \\"wait and bleed\\", and the animated version of wait and bleed. The illest part is the full concert, which i would have paid the whole price for alone.                                                                                               Like i said, it's like im 14 all over again, even though I kept the original release in heavy rotation it's nice to have the whole package. If you're half a Slipknot fan, you're reading this agreeing with me and if not, then you need to get on the wagon. Here's to the next 10 years and the killer live shows that bring this songs to life!! Stay (sic)....Chris W.

B0018LX9T4|4.0|I guess we all need love, no matter how weird that turns out to be.  This movie explores the need for some people to hurt themselves,even to the point where they will do the will of others no matter how bizarre that might be.  Lee is a masochist who needs to be dominated.  She's spent time in an institution only to find the man of her dreams in the form of her employer.    Her employer wants to dominate, and fears being dominated.  He eventually learns of Lee's needs and seemingly knows how to deal with them.  In the end the couple presumably lives happily ever after, though we don't know that for sure.    This film is definitely not for everyone.  For those who crave bizarre, they must realize this is still a mainstream movie which must conform to certainparameters.  The characters are rather drab, almost trite, but they do eventually seem to grow on the viewer's imagination.  Many male viewers may want to have the type of relationship with a women as portrayed in this film.  Most people will feel happy for Lee at the end of the movie because she got what she was searching for.  She just needed to come out of her shell and ask for it.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|The making of \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" had some secrecy attached as well as confusing bits of information the band offered to their audience. Nels Cline suggested dueling guitars while Jeff Tweedy suggested a collective affinity for Fela Kuti. Drummer Glenn Kotche suggested that people should just wait and find out. My wife and I couldn't help but try and predict what was next for everyone's favorite alt-country-whatever outfit. I thought they would continue to branch out and get weird. She thought they would regress to a rollicking style a al \\"Casino Queen\\" from \\"A.M.\\"    We both were wrong. \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" is Wilco's safest album. Whether it be music, lyrics, or production, the band took no chances with this album. Everything is, for better or worse, extremely even-keel. \\"Impossible Germany\\" is the one song here that possibly sounds like it could take flight, but the same track would be considered a snoozer had it appeared on \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" or \\"A Ghost Is Born.\\"    A term that everyone used to describe this album was \\"dad rock.\\" I'll refrain from using it since I'm not entirely sure what that means. I will say that compared to Loose Fur, Nels Cline, Glenn Kotche, and Jay Bennett solo albums, and just about every Wilco album prior to this, \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" feels like triple contraception. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Nothing lost, neither.

These books were fun to read, quick moving in order to keep the interest in a young person up and had good morals as well.    I feel that Mr. Riordan has a good grasp on mythology, what kids like and an excellent way of putting the two together.    I believe these books are a good learning tool/refresher and are meant to be enjoyed by all ages.

B000JQWH24|1.0|I complained to Amazon after paying full price for an an item from this dealer and the dealer renegging on the contract.  Yet Amazon wants a review.    OK--here it is--AMAZON is stupid, doesn't realize that the buyer renegged on the contract, is not aware I filed a complaint and wants a review!!  Amazon is so seller oriented that the buyer is without redress.      The buyer has engaged in this conduct before.  They list something, find out it is worth more than they ask, then say--item is not available--an error in inventory.    Amazaon did not research my complaint.
0930289234|5.0|Over twenty years since it was released, and it is still relevant today (considering nuke scares w/ N. Korea and Iran.)  I think I might have been able to enjoy the movie had I not read the book, but as everyone else who completes the book, I realize the improbability of another medium conveying the story so powerfully.  I believe I spent two days reading through the novel, truly so much there outside of a simple plot to kill superheroes.  And I remember how sad I was the day I finished it, knowing that I would never again be able to enjoy the Watchmen for the first time...<br /><br />Apologies if this review seems random and sporadic.  Just go buy the book and be wow'ed.

0312539517|3.0|I do usually like Jeffrey Archer in the best seller fiction category, but this book is quite a disappointment.<br /><br />\\"Paths of Glory\\" is somewhere in the grey zone between true-life chronicle and fiction. Mountaineering enthusiasts might want to read Sir Francis Younghusband's excellent account of the same events, in his book \\"The Epic of Mount Everest\\".<br /><br />Though a very engrossing topic, Archer seems to have let slide several details, which I found quite irritating (I wondered briefly whether I had picked up a \\"fake\\" Archer)...<br />- the so-called medical examination before the 1922 expedition, in which the participants were put through intense and accelerated changes in pressure, temperature, and wind speed - from sea level to 29,000 ft in 60 mins. Really? It takes several days to acclimatize on the mountain, even between base camp and higher altitudes. It doesn't seem plausible that any participant lived after such a medical examination!<br />- the 1922 expedition lands in Bombay and at the docks, they go about selecting sherpas and mules!! This is ridiculous - even for fiction - why would the already poor sherpas, whose home is in the hills, travel all the way to Bombay and then go back with the expedition? And transporting mules from Bombay to Everest Base Camp?? Even back in the 20's no one would do that.<br />- the blithe reference to distance between Bombay and Siliguri - supposedly to be covered in 6 hrs, and Mallory in a letter to his wife, complains that it took 16 hrs..... this is impossible. Bombay to Calcutta takes over 36 hrs by train (about 1000 miles!) and an overnight train journey from Calcutta to Siligury.<br /><br />Apart from factual errors, there are no descriptions of real mountain climbing. Archer makes it seem like a \\"very tough walk in the snow\\" - where climbers can walk together stopping to munch on digestive biscuits along the way. Nowadays when there are tens of well written mountaineering real life stories, this is a little too superficial.<br /><br />The characters are two dimensional and sketchy, except for Mallory - whose character seems quite inconsistent - sometimes the ideal larger than life hero, sometimes an alpha male child wanting to be the first.<br /><br />Archer ought to stick to regular fiction, and not try to blend the fiction and mountain climbing genres.. it leaves both wanting.s are two dimensional and sketchy, except for Mallory - whose character seems quite inconsistent - sometimes the ideal larger than life hero, sometimes an alpha male child wanting to be the first.

1416972242|5.0|I loved the book and the series.  The characters are believable and endearing.  Clare creates a world I love to escape to.  My daughters and I couldn't put the books down, and we finished them quickly.  This is one of the few book series that I will read again and again.  I am looking forward to other books by Cassandra Clare.
1905654294|1.0|I found out my 11-year-old was reading this book, given to her by a family member. After going through the book and reading reviews, I was shocked -- I saw that it is not appropriate for her due to the strong sexual content and the dark subject matter. This book is not appropriate for kids, including preteens and young teens.  I don't want my daughter coming of age reading books like this.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Finally, a gay romance flick that isn't completely based around tragedy or a terrible unfolding fate, just a romance between two people that audiences gay and straight can enjoy.  I bought this product when it was first released from a retailer here in Northern Utah, and it cost me [...], which leads me to my point: [...] is worth it to experience a film like this.  Heck, [...]would of even been worth it.  This is one of my favorite romance films, gay or straight, and even though the technical presentation on the DVD is a bit underwhelming (the picture is soft, but the sound is fine, presented in Dolby Digital 5.1), that would be an invalid reason to miss a great of film as this.<br /><br />If you are buying this DVD solely with the purpose of demoing your Home Theater system in the terms of picture quality, you'll be a bit disappointed.  But who am I kidding?  This isn't some action flick or a ridiculously high budget and loud special effects extravaganza.

B0000CD818|5.0|This is a gorgeously recorded and beautifully produced gem of an album - yes, Steve Hackett has \\"re-interpreted\\" these songs as he revisits them, and that is the whole point.  If you want to hear the originals, dig 'em out and listen to them.  This is something completely different, refreshing, and at times, breathtaking. Worth buying for \\"Watcher Of The Skies\\",  \\"Dance On A Volcano\\", and \\"Firth of Fifth\\" alone... dramatic, terrifying, and sublime.  \\"Deja Vu\\" is an unexpected gem, originally written by Peter Gabriel for Genesis, but never finished.  Buy this - unless you were actually looking for something else and found \\"weird music\\" instead (how DOES one do such a thing? - LOL.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|The price was great and the series fantastic, I bought this for my husband and he could not believe the quality of the DVDs .  We order a lot over the web and the packaging was also great.    I will continue to buy from amazon.com
0307341550|5.0|This is not your typical murder mystery/thriller.  I find a lot of books today focus on the investigator(s) involved in solving a murder and crime scene details, cop stuff as I call it (I'm sure to some degree influenced by today's hit shows on tv).  I'm more in to the psychological aspects and influences of people and what led to the events that are at the heart of the story.  This book definitely did not disappoint!  It's sort of like someone telling you they have a dark secret to share, and though you might have a sense of alarm, you are intrigued to know what it is.  The characters and subject matter can be disturbing, but it keeps you wanting to know more about where the story will go.  I purchased this book based on other reviews I read and I finished it in a day.  This does not happen often for me, but I didn't find that there were any slow parts that made me want to put the book down. I will definitely be looking to read Flynn's other novel, Dark Places.
0385341008|5.0|My book club of ten women various ages just read this book and we all loved it! Everything a great novel should do  - engage you and take you totally to a different time and place. The characters are interesting and endearing and I never wanted to leave all of my new friends in Guernsey!!! I will read and reread this novel throughout the rest of my life (and I don't do that) but this book is a keeper - so sad the author isn't here to enjoy this positive feedback.
B002GJU54E|5.0|I loved this book!  It took me two days to get through it.  Ms. Evanovich did a bang up job (no pun intended).  It grabbed me at the beginning and did not let go.  And it was incredibly funny!!!!

0385340990|5.0|This is a very thoughtful book written from many people's perspectives about the German invasion of Guernsey Island during the war. Each chapter is a letter written to one or another of the characters.  The authors obviously did extensive research.  This book is an easy read; the biggest problem is that life requires you to put it down when you get so caught up in the lives of the characters, you want to just keep reading.  The main character is a young woman journalist/author who lived in London during the war, she writes a column that some love and others hate. As she does an article about this literary group in Guernsey, she becomes intertwined with the aftermath of the war and the people of the island.<br /><br />This would be a wonderful book for book groups; in this book they form their own book group with many strong opinions about authors and literary works.
B0028SVXR6|2.0|Ever since after Frances the Mute, Mars Volta has become something totally different. I've become rather distant from the band since their last few albums as they've become over produced. Just so much going on that most of the time I'm trying to find something enjoyable to what I'm hearing. If your a fan of De-Loused & F.T.M. you might not find this album to appealing to your palette. There are however some parts of this album I can find myself connecting to, but shortly after I'm wanting to change the track. This album is very laid-back, but not spectacular laid-back. Unless Volta finds that audience connection they once had, I'm finding myself & others slowly fading away from this once enjoyable group.
B0026OE2NY|2.0|I found this program to move too slowly to hold my kids (ages 5, 9 & 13) interest and the educational content was not adequate to hold mine. The photography on the other hand was stunning. May be better for background viewing with the sound off. It would be of great benefit to those who are skeptical or unaware of man's impact on Earth unfortunately, they aren't the likely audience.
B0000029LG|5.0|These CD's made me feel the love that Michael so often tried to share with his fans.  It was amazing and the song \\"Smile\\" was my favorite. It's got to be number one on the charts.  And for all those that wanted to judge Michael for being who he is should here his song \\"Childhood\\".  I cried while listening to that song because I realize he just wanted to enjoy the life that we non- famous people so often take for granted.  I just hate that he had to die before we (the World) realized what we had in him. Michael was \\"Love\\" to me and always will be.  I am truly going to miss him and all that he has contributed to my world through songs.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Who wouldn't love The Sound of Music? Definitely an all-time favorite. Great music, storyline, costumes and humor.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This movie is unlike anything you have seen before. Instead of on-going gorging on flesh and lots of blood throughout the movie that creates a tale story you know is not really true, \\"Let the Right One In\\" is done in such a way that it pulls you into the plot. You experience being there, and all events appear very realistic in the sense that it seems like every day life rather than a fake entertainment show. And the main purpose of the movie is not to scare you with sudden episodes and loud, sharp noise, but to tell a story of the unusual friendship and loyalty. While the movie is intense, scares you and predictable at times, it actually *flows* and you don't want it to stop. A great movie and great sound track. You also see real Sweden's small town. Very nice. Highly recommended. I heard it came out on Blue-Ray. If you can get it that way, it is even better.
B001UREJWM|1.0|THe only song that is any good on this album IMHO is Bible Black.  Save yourselves the cash and just go download \\"Bible Black\\".  I gave the whole album a fair shake and listened to it numerous times trying to find some semblance of a good tune other that Bible Black, but nothing seemed to have anything.
B00127RAJY|5.0|First off, I'd like to think I'm decently fit but doing this workout video really tested my endurance. The first couple of days I did it, I was literally in pain and could barely walk up the stairs. I was ready to throw in the towel and call it quits. HOWEVER, something made me stick to it and boy, am I glad!! This video will work your core and all this in 20 minutes?! After doing Jillian Michaels for about a month now, I feel stronger and more importantly, I am more toned. Where I used to have flab come off my arms like dough, now I have a more muscular upper body. I keep getting compliments from friends and family and I love it! Jillian does get kind of annoying as the video progresses, but that's a small price to pay considering the results you'll get if you do this workout regularly. All you need is a little motivation..maybe a lot of motivation but you will not regret it. Do it and find out for yourself!=)

B0029NY9YO|2.0|A lot of people here seem to be reviewing the directors cut.  If they'd look at the top of the page they'd see this is the theatrical cut.  Being the only one I've seen that is all I will address here.  Utter disappointment.  But then when you've been waiting for a movie for 23 years how can it not disappoint.  We all have our perfect Watchmen in our head and no matter how good a job the director did it would never match up.  It is a project that was doomed from the start.  Lost in this movie version was what made the book so compelling.  The book seemed to go out of it's way to show how ridiculous the very idea of superheroes are.  The idea of putting on a costume and picking fights with strangers is, on the surface, laughable.  In the end our \\"heroes\\" were completely ineffectual.  In the movie version, however, a great deal of time and money seemed to be spent on making them look cool.  Night owl goes from a paunchy middle aged recluse to a ripped leading man.  Roscharch goes from a nearly homeless loser to a gritty anti-hero.  And Silk Spectre from a 30 something has been with daddy issues to a va va voom sex kitty.  And on and on.  But this is just Watchmen through my personal prism.  Every fan takes something else from the book and finds that particular bit the most important.  So in the end he tried his best and he should be congratulated for what he accomplished.  But unfortunately for ocd fans like me it will never be enough.
B0028K31CE|3.0|A really long wait for his new CD and it's just plain OK.. not what I was hoping for after all this time.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Interesting board game for older children and adults.  Lots of small pieces but once you get set up it is pretty user friendly.  The rules seem complex at first but after you run through it once it is easy to play.  It is a lot of fun and it has a definate end game so it doesn't go on forever.  We are in our 50's and it makes a good Friday night game.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|A delightful read. Character development is outstanding.  I felt like I knew all the characters.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I love this cd, or anything twilight for that matter. However, some cd's have 14 songs on them and this one only has 12. I really wanted the other Rob Pattinson song even if it is only like a minute long. Other than missing the two songs, a great CD.
B000002I7H|5.0|Maybe not the most intense representation of Albert King but a good example of his versatility.  Highly recommend!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney has come a long way! Indeed, when you hear this new CD, you will agree!! The old Whitney (as we knew her), has come out of the darkness and into the light. Considering her journey back, I find her CD WONDERFUL!! Listen to \\" I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" and you will understand her testimony and rejoice in her continued triumph. I fell that, commercially, \\"Like I Never Left\\" (featuring Akon) will soar to number one on all the charts!! \\" Nuthin But Love\\" shows that she has no regrets about her journey. She says GOODBY to all those old bad things with \\"Salute\\". All in all, we should embrace and support Whitney. Whitney Houston is a survivor and can now stand alongside Natalie Cole and Chaka Khan. The proof is in this CD!! Go, Whitney....,Go!!!!!!!!!!!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I am always astounded that out of the 100+ channels of TV I get, there is frequently absolutely nothing that is worthy of the relatively few hours I devote to entertainment TV.  Programs such as this provide a happy respite.
B000M0XJ88|4.0|I really like thiis watch. I'm sure the band will need to be replaced regularly but various NATO bands are available all over the net. The watch is very accurate, +/- 3 seconds/day but I'm sure individual results will vary. If it ever becomes less accurate getting it adjusted is easy and cheap and should be a part of the annual pro-service anyway. I had that read that this model would stay wound for 36-48 hours but mine has never lasted longer than 12 hours. Still a very nice timepiece for the money.
B0028NSE3M|5.0|Few albums climb to the top of their genre so as to define the genre. Isaac Hayes' album is the very definition of Hot Buttered Soul. The vocals, in combination with the orchestrations on virtually every track on the album, provide a powerful mood-setting experience. I purchased the original album in 1970 based on the recommendation of (the late great) Marty Faye---a Chicago Jazz DJ; But this re-release on CD is sublime.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The product arrived as promised on time and in excellent condition. I presented to a friend as a gift.  They really enjoyed it, worth buying and passing on to others.  Thanks,  Colleen
B000LAZDQA|5.0|The music, the people, the story, as well as the extras make this a must see film.
B00000JRTX|4.0|Classic comedy. All the supporting case is stellar. Except Andie MacDowell. She's not believable (is she really attractive enough to follow around at all these weddings?) and at this point in her career, she wasn't that good an actress. Or maybe this is her being good and in that case I just don't think she's all that and a bag of chips.<br /><br />The funniest scene in my opinion is Hugh stuck in the pantry.<br /><br />As for the DVD, I have the 1999 disc and it's as bare-bones as you can get (i.e., non \\"Deluxe Edition\\"), although it does include a 'Collectible \\"Making Of\\" Booklet'--wow! Hopefully the extra bucks get you some extras? Mike Newell did a fantastic Director's Commentary for Donnie Brasco so here's hoping.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that a romantic comedy was nominated for Best Picture (1994). Then again it seems like the Academy was big into nominating a British film almost every year in the 1990s.
0060557818|4.0|Give it a decade, Neil Gaiman will be taught in college lit classes alongside Sedaris and Palahniuk as giants of late 20th century fiction.<br /><br />Gaiman is a master of stories of the \\"journey\\" type - the narration of a character who travels (usually against his will) to a world that is unlike whatever he has known before.  Where Gaiman brings the journey into his own is in painting the surrealistic, dystopian and often nightmarish realms that the character finds himself thrust into - as he did with \\"Anansi Boys\\", he also does with \\"Neverwhere\\".<br /><br />Clearly a lover of myth, Gaiman embraces a very Goth vision as well as he did with African legends in \\"Anansi Boys\\" and Medieval Christianity in \\"Good Omens\\".  While he attempts to retain some humor, this is a story far darker than either of the previous books, culling from the most base and primitive aspects of men.<br /><br />It was, in short, an enjoyable read, and a quick one. My only complaint is that it was too quick - the plot sometimes felt pressed together unnaturally, but Gaiman's narrative skills made it easy to accept the points that were glossed over.<br /><br />It's also a little difficult to read a cheeky British sense of humor into such a sinister underworld as London Below, but I'll forgive him that.
0316044695|5.0|To say that this is one of the best books I've ever read is an understatement.  Words really cannot accurately describe how amazing, thought-provoking, insightful and terrific this book is.  Honestly, you need to stop reading this review right now and BUY THE BOOK.  You will not be disappointed. It is graphic, heart-wrenching, emotional and sad, but each of those emotions is countered with awe, inspiration, pride and so much more.  Read the other reviews if you want plot details, however, no matter your political, religious or any other affiliation, Luttrell's story speaks to every single person.<br /><br />This is also a very accessible book, meaning that it is easy to read and it is very easy to get deeply into the action and the story.  I have never read any type of military book previous to this one and thought it might not interest me that much but I was dead wrong. Even someone who is not familiar with military workings or interested in military-type stories, will really love this book.  I read it in about two days; I couldn't put it down and when I did finally finish it, I was really upset that I didn't have anymore to read.  Buy this book!  You'll want to read it more than once.
0061703087|2.0|I'm no writer, so I'll keep this brief and to the point.    The Bad:  The story is distractingly derivative of many familiar works of science fiction. Most notably Invasion of the Body Snatchers (and every incarnation thereof), Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Several of the characters seemed to be copy and pasted from other Crichton novels.     The main character is astonishingly stupid. Not until the very last pages does the main character piece together basic elements of the \\"mystery\\" that are glaringly obvious to the reader. If you're like me, then you'll keep reading, thinking Crichton is setting you up for a surprise, but he doesn't. Everything is exactly what you think it is from the first 1/3rd of the book.     WAY too many long-winded, technical tangents. Usually this is something that I love about Crichton, you learn a lot about the possibilities of modern technology. Unfortunately, molecular engineering, nano-technology, swarm behavioral biology and the most grindingly-boring: computer code is not NEARLY as interesting as genetically engineered dinosaurs, mysterious extra-terrestrial sentient objects, time travel, etc. The pacing is so weighed down with frustratingly uninteresting technical mumbo-jumbo, which always seems to chime in for pages and pages right when things start getting interesting. I found myself skipping pages of it towards the end. It also makes dialogue fairly hard to believe. It's hard to feel life or death urgency of a situation when someone answers simple questions with long, complicated paragraphs of technical jargon.   It's not that this stuff is hard to understand, it's not. At all. Which makes it all the more annoying when Crichton makes multiple examples for 1 point. Or reiterates (for example) the nature of swarm behavior again and again. To his credit, there's a fine line between simplifying extremely complicated science to make it easier to understand and just treating your readers like they are hardly literate.     The Good:  Despite all that, it's a fun read that I couldn't put down towards then end. Ultimately the result is VERY disappointing because of what I said before, there are NO surprises at the end. It's all quite clear to the reader from the beginning, but the paradoxically dim-witted protagonist for some reason can't manage to put the pieces together.    I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but those who are utterly fascinated by Nano-technology and/or the (now cliche) subject of man losing control of technology. Or those who have read every other of Crichton's work.     It's just not a good book. And not even that fun.
1554072840|5.0|I thought the book was simple and a little pointless until I read it to my daughter and saw her reaction. She totally got it. Even though I had already told her about pee pee and poo poo, hearing it from an objective third party really helped drive the point home. I'm just her mom, what do I know about these things.    Even though the potty in the book looks nothing like hers, she still understood exactly what the picture represented. She thought the cat bowl and bird bath jokes were actually funny. That's her favorite part in the story.    She was encourage by the part where the little girl misses the potty and goes on the floor. It made her feel like she wasn't alone. This is a huge deal for a little girl who always strives to be good. We talked about this for a minute. Yes, my two year old is a good talker. I think it comes from reading so many books.    The message was simple and really hit home. My two year old didn't need a biology lesson or a silly song. She needed another mommy to reinforce what her mommy already told her.    It gave me some credibility and her some confidence.

B001R0KH3M|4.0|I agree that the lack of a live performance of Stevie on DVD unitl now is inexcusable for both Motown and for Stevie. Stevie like so many artists of his age group has become somewhat complacent about new material not to mention the new mediums to express and expose themselves to both new and old audiences. That being said this performance is great but not without some real editing and sound issues. There are times when Stevie's (who I believe is supposed to be the star of this performance) keyboards are no where in the mix. The same applies to other performers during the course of the video. While I like the notion of seeing a concert as it was performed, Stevie for all his genius can be a rambler verbally and musically and \\"songs\\" like the gospel rave-up with the audience, the \\"talk- box\\" medley of beatles and Stylistic tunes could have been easily edited from the video as as far as I'm concerned the performance too. This is Stevie Wonder the quintessential American songwriter resorting to gimmicks. While you get alot of Stevie's greatest hits there are some glaring omissions. There is not sinlge tune from \\"Fulfillingness 1st Finale\\", but he does inlcude \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\" the worst tune he's ever written. The band is absolutely awesome and his decision really feature them on Chick Corea's \\"Spain\\" was a wise and rewarding decision. His daughter while an adequate vocalist is in water way over her head as a featured soloist especially on the demanding tune he or she chose. Yes I recommend this whole heartedly because whatelse is out there to document Stevie in a live performance. Next time Stevie hire and editor and soemone with ears to do the final mix.
B001JV5BIA|3.0|I wanted to see this movie before watching the remake! This movie is snuff film made during the Grindhouse Era. Some parts are kinda hard to watch, like Mari and Phyllis being tortured, raped, and forced to have sex together. Other parts are just silly like the dialogue, and using the Sheriff and Deputy as comic relief who try to get to the Collingwood house by sitting on top of a chicken truck.<br /><br />After the murder of their daughter, the Collingwoods realize that they let the killers take refuge in their home. The parents plan their revenge by killing those reponsible for the loss of their child. If you like classic horror, corny dialogue, and early Wes Craven films, you might like THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT!!!
0312370849|4.0|I liked the book most of the way through; but towards the end it started getting a little soap oprahish for me.
B002DKGWSE|4.0|I liked this version a lot better than the original, because it was more suspenseful, and less silly! It was pretty brutal on a few parts. Mari Collingwood is spending her vacation with her parents at their lake house. She meets up with a friend who is trying to find some weed. They end up running into Krug and his gang. They take the girls deep into the woods and begin to torture them. After Mari is raped by Krug and left for dead, the group seek shelter at the Collingwood's house. When they find out what the group did to their daughter, the parents take their awesome revenge! I highly recommend THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT!!!

B000NU2CY4|5.0|I agree with many others here that this bad PQ talk is less than accurate. I played (the Netflix) it on my Oppo BDP-83 -> Onkyo 805 -> Sony 52\\" XBR5 and it looks and sounds better than my DVD copy. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and have just purchased it from Amazon.<br /><br />So, for all you who like to get into odds&ends in movies, I replayed The Gladiator, and the movie Zulu soundtrack starts at 00:04:15 (immediately after Crowe says, \\"Is acceptable, agreed?\\") and continues on-and-off until 00:06:27. Sounds like the same Zulu soundbite repeated at varying times.<br />Then I replayed [[ASIN:B001CTBGNS Zulu (1964]) [Blu-ray]]]. The part(s) of the Zulu soundtrack used in Gladiator comes from 01:09:45 to 01:10:46 in Zulu. The Zulu are rushing the fort, but only to allow the Chief to count the British rifles. The Zulus smash their spears against their shields and cry, \\"uSuthu!\\". Their leader says something like, \\"BOONG, WATREECE!\\" and the Zulu rush forward saying something like, \\"Yah!\\" or \\"Yo!\\", the leader repeats, the Zulu repeat. That's exactly what's on the Gladiator soundtrack.<br /><br />...and from Wiki: \\"The Germanic war chant in the battle scene at the beginning of Ridley Scott's film Gladiator is the Zulu war chant from Zulu. In the video commentary, Scott revealed that Zulu was one of his favourite movies.\\"

0439023491|5.0|This book picks up very quickly where the Hunger Games left off.  About every 20 pages, I was either shocked or smiling.  I wanted to share what I was thinking - with people around me - but they were all waiting for me to finish the book so they could read it.  It was very intense and never a dull moment.  Ms. collins introduces a whole new set of characters and with her smooth writing, you are able to get to know them very quickly and easily.  I can't wait until the next book in the series comes out, which I hear is in the Spring.  I am glad I bought this book and especially at such a cheap price at Amazon.  If you liked Twillight books - and you haven't read the Hunger Games yet - get it first and then read this one right away!  Very interesting and you will be sad when it ends because you want to keep reading about the characters!
B002JYPV3G|4.0|While I have been a Slipknot fan since catching them on OzzFest supporting the original release of the CD, I was slightly disappointed today upon listening to this release of the CD.  I am one of the fortunate ones out there who has a copy of the original release that contains Frail Limb Nursery followed by Purity.  When looking over the tracks on the re-issue I failed to notice that Frail Limb Nursery was missing.  Today I found that it was missing when I was listening to this after my purchase and realized that there is a HUGE transition missing between Tattered and Torn into Purity without Frail Limb Nursery.  While it was just a track of samples, the track itself helped the flow from Tattered and Torn into Purity.    Another person mentioned the missing silence that leads into the recording made by the band members while watching a porno as Chris Fehn is initiated into the group prior to Eeyore.  While it isn't necessary to include, I feel sold a little short to have that cut from the re-issue as well.  People are going to ride me for pointing out these two small things but I am a purist.  If you are going to give us a re-issue then do it with everything we were given the first time around.  Be it necessary or not, these are part of the things that contributed to the buzz of their first major label release.  That would be like, for us older metal fans, the re-issue of Alice In Chains 'Dirt' with the omission of \\"Iron Gland\\".  No..  It is not remotely necessary to have the 43 second track of noise but it is what they released on the original release.  Give it to us the way we remembered it.
0679424741|5.0|`The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter', published in 1940 when Carson McCullers was just twenty-three, is set in a small Georgia town and tells the story of five isolated and spiritually-frustrated characters.  There's Mick Kelly (based on McCullers herself), a young girl who is always writing music in her head and dreaming of travel to foreign lands.  Dr. Benedict Copeland is an African-American doctor who struggles to make others of his race see the truth about their plight as he sees it.  Jake Blount is a potentially violent drifter who rants about socialism and fruitlessly tries to inspire the working class to rise up and demand more from their employers.  Biff Brannon is the sexually-ambiguous café owner who spends hours on end thinking through his muddled thoughts.  And finally, there's John Singer, a deaf-mute who the other four befriend because, as an intelligent and kind man who cannot talk himself, he is a good listener.      The story revolves around Singer who, more than just serving as a symbol of their mutual incomprehension through his handicap, acts as an almost God-like figure to the other four.  He is to each whatever they want him to be.  They all go to him to tell him of their problems as a Christian goes to church to pray. Meanwhile, all he really cares about is his friend, also a deaf-mute, who sits miles away in a hospital bed.  His whole existence revolves around periodic pilgrimages to see this friend.  The other four pout when he's gone, as one might when God doesn't answer a prayer.  I found myself wishing they could seek solace amongst themselves, especially Copeland and Blount who shared similar views.  But even when they do intersect, they are unable to fully connect.  It is only Singer who can bring them solace.      The characters are drawn in a mostly unsympathetic light, except for Singer and Mick who, because of what they are, could almost not be portrayed any other way but sympathetically.  Brannon is just too odd; there were times I wondered if he were a pedophile.  Blount is too angry to care about.  I rooted for Copeland a little bit, but once he and Blount failed to reach a détente, I was left feeling that they weren't interested in compromising their views and thus were really just selfish people, unwilling to live in a world that didn't fit their specific ideas.                  McCullers's writing is a cross between the Russian realists of the 19th century and Flannery O'Connor.  Like the Russians, she writes to reflect real life.  Like O'Connor, she writes about the edges of society.  There isn't a traditional plot: the narrative just follows their struggles with isolation and need for self-expression.  McCullers has said she based the format of the book on a fugue, which explores various themes through repetition and development.  Thus in place of a plot is the examination of these themes to their fullest extent, at which point the book can resolve.   The themes she examines are noble themes, some timely (racism, communism), others universal (the need for self-fulfillment, the feeling of isolation from society), which makes this a worthwhile book.  Others have written reviews asking why such a `boring' book without a standard plot or happy ending would be considered a classic.  It's the universal themes of the book and the beautiful prose that make it a classic.  Life doesn't always end up the way we want it to, nor do the books we read.

This book is highly recommended.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|So much and too much have already been said about this album and this Artiste...what more can I add? Suffice to say one has to enjoy or at least listen to this CD wholly on its own merits. Don't try (although it's hard) to compare it with previous Whitney's efforts. For one i like it although definitely it could be way better. I have always been exposed to Whitney's countless greatest hits but i have only gotten her old albums recently and therefore wasn't too influenced by the old Whitney. I like the title track alot. Good song...good singing even if it could have been better. Would this music garner her Grammies next year? Maybe some nominations at least.

0307588335|5.0|As someone who worked with Larry and all the other key players, I am happy to confirm that the character descriptions, timelines and \\"take aways\\" are spot on. Larry's ability to tell the story in such a user-friendly manner made the book more enjoyable than I anticipated. I laughed out loud and teared-up, sometimes within a chapter, as I re-lived so much in such accurate detail. For those that may not have had the inside track on what was happening at Lehman, or within the market in general, this book will help guide you through the quagmire.  The easy-to-follow explanations of financial terms should also come in handy for anyone learning about finance from reading the paper.      I have bought the book for family and friends so they can understand what I went through and what, like Larry, I continue to go through - the sadness associated with losing something that meant so much to me professionally. Thank you Larry for putting the words to the paper and capturing the details that still haunt so many.
0393061310|4.0|Through an insightful synthesis of clues from diverse fields including archeology, geography, climatology, cultural anthropology, linguistics and ecosystem science, Jared Diamond's lucid and thought-provoking Guns, Germs, and Steel offers a comprehensive \\"bedrock to topsoil\\" explanation of trends in human settlement patterns over the past 13,000 years since the most recent Ice Age.  The unifying theme is that the basic geography of the continents has been the key long-run driver behind differences in the rate of innovation and economic progress among societies around the globe.    Favorable environmental conditions inherent in Eurasia's latitudinal east-west continental geography fostered a richer, more varied ecosystem that provided higher availability of wild ancestral high-calorie plants and large animals that could be domesticated, thereby predisposing its human inhabitants to develop agriculture and technology, a written language, political organization, weaponry, higher population densities and, inadvertently, infectious diseases originating from mutating animal viruses, all of which gave Eurasian societies a head start and competitive advantage over early inhabitants of the other continents--Africa, North and South America and Australia--each of which has a longitudinal north-south profile or is more isolated from the other continents.  Essentially, according to the thesis, geography-based fate, more than any significant difference in raw intelligence or ability across ethnic groups, has skewed the wealth distribution and technical advances towards certain European powers and their offshoots, notably the U.S., and Asian nations, historically China and more recently Japan.    The appeal of Diamond's explanation is its foundation in behind-the-scenes natural forces that influence outcomes over broad expanses of time and distance, without having to rely more arbitrarily on one-time events and circumstances that often assign undue importance to individual leadersand \\"great man\\" figures to explain the observed flow of human history.  Like a theory in the sciences, Diamond's thesis is constructed to be logically consistent with the past; however, its inherent weakness is its lack of meaningful predictive power over a short enough future timeframe to enable testability.  As Diamond acknowledges, in our modern world with same-day air travel to anywhere on the globe and the Internet providing practically instantaneous communication, \\"One might even wonder whether the geographical reasoning employed throughout this book has at last become wholly irrelevant in the modern world. . . .\\"     Consequently, although Diamond's explanation of how certain human societies (and, more controversially, ethnicities) have come to dominate others is profoundly satisfying, it provides us with very limited guidance about which continents, countries or ethnic groups are likely to have a relative advantage in the centuries and millennia ahead.  My own guess is that, over the past 500 years since Columbus \\"discovered\\" America, human societies have undergone a \\"phase transition\\" which has created greater interconnectedness, placing us all for survival purposes in the \\"same boat\\" on spaceship Earth, so that \\"soft\\" factors, such as cultural values, education and the environmental choices societies make--not \\"hard\\" factors such as geography, germs and territorial clashes of societies against one another--will be the primary determinants of human progress and relative advantage among societies in the 21st century and beyond.

B000BTGY1O|5.0|\\"Breakfast At Tiffany's\\" is one of those Hollywood films that never ages. A beautifully acted and well-crafted film, \\"Breakfast\\" is one of my all-time favorite movies from the 1960's. Starring Audrey Hepburn in a role she was born to play, Audrey plays a young woman living in New York City trying to find Mr. Right while working in the oldest profession in the book. The undertone and subtext of the film is evident to modern audiences in that Hepburn is playing a high-class prostitute. Is is this particular role that shows the world that call-girls are not just the ones walking in dark alleys while being drug-addicted. Hepburns's portrayal of her role is real and honest as there are many in this particular profession who are beautiful, articulate, witty, and exquisite. The viewer falls in love with Audrey's character Holly as well as Audrey herself as her role is one of the most likable in film history.<br /> \\"Breakfast At Tiffany's\\" is also known for its mesmerizing score by Henri Mancini who won an Oscar as well as another for the theme song \\"Moon River\\" co-written by Johnny Mercer. The supporting cast is one of Hollywood's best with the marvelous George Peppard, Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Mickey Rooney, and Martin Balsam.<br /> This lovely DVD release is the Anniversary Edition featuring commentary by producer Richard Sheperd, the featurette \\"The Making of a Classic\\", theatrical trailer, and more. The DVD case is enclosed in a beautiful pink cardboard case for safe-keeping. Movies like this are rare. Enjoy!

B000009MF7|5.0|I've heard most performances of Ravel's ultra-popular \\"Piano Concerto in G major.\\" Three of my favorites are Roge/Dutoit, Argerich/Abbado (2nd time recording), and this one with Krystian Zimerman and Pierre Boulez. Of course, Boulez is no stranger to Ravel's music as he has recorded much of it for Sony and Deutsche Grammophon, but I think this is one of his finest Ravel recordings next to his reading of \\"Daphnis et Chloe.\\" Everything is right about this performance. Zimerman is on fire and plays with an emotional intensity whereas Boulez, as usual, provides very controlled, thoughtful accompaniment.<br /><br />The other performances \\"Valses Nobles et Sentimentales\\" and \\"Piano Concerto for the Left-Hand\\" are given very good readings as well, but the show stopper here is the \\"Concerto in G.\\" The Cleveland Orchestra plays extremely well. Probably the best I've heard them since George Szell. They have never sounded so alive.<br /><br />If you're looking for a one-stop collection of Ravel's piano concertos, then this recording is for you, but I urge you to acquire different readings of these concertos as well. No recording is definitive, but this is about as close as you're ever going to get with these pieces.

0452289963|5.0|While I must admit that I had severe trepidations about reading this offering by Eckhart Tolle, as I was only slightly interested in his previous work \\"The Power of Now,\\" (which I reviewed on Amazon) this offering was in my opinion several orders of magnitude better, richer, deeper and much more inviting and inspiring than TPoN.  A New Earth is basically a restatement of universal truths originally promulgated by the Vedas, Sutras and New & Old Testament scriptures.  As the bulk of the hoary traditions previously mentioned expound the same truths albeit from different perspectives, languages and times - so does A New Earth, but from a more pragmatic and relateable level.<br /><br />Mr. Tolle takes us on a very revealing journey through the ways and means of that clever little rascal known as the ego.  The author does use some archaic wisdom and quotations to help elucidate the points that he makes so as to associate and reinforce those points, ideas and reflections.  There is nothing here that hasn't been presented in countless ways in bygone eras as well as from contemporary spiritual advisors; the beauty of New Earth lies in it's presentation, which will be comprehended by modern people(s) much more readily and thus understood & implemented much more efficaciously.  Concisely stated: this is a spiritual teaching of our time, for our time.<br /><br />Very well written, with an eye toward the practical application of \\"Being\\" - designed for the present day seeker.  I offer 5 stars on the board but a real 4 and ½ as the book failed to make me chuckle even once.  Dare I ask Mr. Tolle, do you think just once you could let your own joy radiate through your work with an off-the cuff, impudent remark just for the sake of a laugh??  Great book!!!

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Yes folks, Star Trek is back and back in a big way. Be warned that spoilers are ahead, but considering the plot of J.J. Abrams' reboot of Gene Roddenberry's legendary franchise has been pretty much out in the open, I'm probably not saying anything that you don't already know anyway. It all begins with the vengeful Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) coming back in time to wreak havoc on the Federation, so much so that it impacts the history and continuity that die hard Trekkies will no doubt find bones to pick with. From that point forward, we are introduced to the young and reckless James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) who is convinced by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in Starfleet. It isn't long before Kirk is at odds with Spock (Heroes' Zachary Quinto); who himself is an outcast among his own Vulcan people, and shares a rocky relationship with his Vulcan father Sarek (Ben Cross) and human mother Amanda (Winona Ryder). The dynamic and groundwork laid of Kirk and Spock's relationship is what helps make Abrams' take on Star Trek so good, as he modernizes nearly everything that Trek fans hold dear (seeing young Kirk driving to the Beastie Boys' \\"Sabotage\\" may be overdoing it a bit, but hey...), yet he manages to pay enough homage to the original series while putting his own spin on things. Pine and especially Quinto are surprisingly wonderfully cast and Kirk and Spock, as is Karl Urban as McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg in an all too brief turn as Scottie, and Bana as Nero; who is undoubtedly the best Trek film villain since Khan. John Cho as Sulu and Anton Yelchin as Chekov are fine in their relatively small turns as the film moves along with a nicely brisk pace, but the real surprise manages to be the emotional chords that Abrams pulls; whether it be the destruction of the planet Vulcan or the appearance and guidance of old Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who foretells his past self and Kirk alike that their bond and friendship is more than paramount. With brilliant effects, epic space battles, and overall dynamite action scenes; this is the Star Trek for a new generation that we have all wanted and rightly deserve. Now here's hoping that Abrams can manage to pull another rabbit out of his hat with the series someday further down the line.t effects, epic space battles, and overall dynamite action scenes; this is the Star Trek for a new generation that we have all wanted and rightly deserve.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|David Gilmour's best work to date. This concert was held in a smaller venue as compared to the huge \\"PULSE\\" concert. In the Royal Albert Hall the accoustics are better and the listener gets more out of the lyrics to the music. Also the two part concert opens with slower, softer part one and then rocks in part two. I have to rate this as a 5 Star concert. Fantastic would be a mild under-statement.  Steve

About the yin and the yang, the back and the forth, the dichotomous relationship that produces the amazing and bizarre in life, but when related to addiction results so often in pleasure and pain.<br /><br />Understandable yet ridiculous, the give and take of addiction manifests itself in many ways throughout Choke.  Medical professionals probably feel the elation saving a life or fixing ailments, but are conversely disgusted knowing how that plunger handle got lodged up there - despite the patient's protests.  With the subtopics of sexual addiction, religion, and hospital visits in this book, the previous metaphor is disturbingly appropriate.<br /><br />A med-school dropout, Victor diagnoses strippers' melanoma as incurable cancer and picks up women at sex addicts' meetings for fun.  He wears a scratchy wool costume at a colonial reenactment village to pay the bills, most notably his mother's medical bills for Alzheimer's.  Outwardly his fellow employees look and act as if transported into centuries past; realistically, however, most discretely yearn for the comforts and addictions of their current lifestyles.  Told through a thick haze of self-loathing, Victor is no different from others; his sex addiction is known but he can't beat it off.<br /><br />When salvation is within grasp, the addicted still don't really want help, which is Victor's issue.  Reliant upon others for salvation or help, he pretends to choke at restaurants to get free meals, but primarily to create heroes and earn some extra cash while making himself feel better.  With his ruse, however, he tempts fate: if the choking is fake, everyone else thinks it's real; when it's real be careful, lest one end up as the boy who cried wolf.<br /><br />Told interspersed with oddball childhood recollections of leapfrogging between foster parents and his mother's abductions, Victor is almost predisposed for the codependency on which every aspect of this novel tramples.  When the walls come crumbling down around his life, however, pleasure and pain is felt throughout the \\"colony.\\"<br /><br />Perverse and heart-warming, chock full of lists of bizarre trivia, this is classic Chuck Palahniuk.  If you're familiar with his work, you'll understand and love it.  If not, I highly recommend this book for the slightly twisted looking for an original concept with a twist of dark comedy.g down around his life, however, pleasure and pain is felt throughout the \\"colony.\\"      Perverse and heart-warming, chock full of lists of bizarre trivia, this is classic Chuck Palahniuk.

B001DF68MA|5.0|My daughter loves this seat, it looked like it might be a little cramp but was a perfect fit. Installation was easy, all the tools needed were included in the box. Well balanced compared to rear seats. Just takes a little adjustment to when riding, since your child is siting right in front of you, which is strange if you are use to riding a certain way. I had to lower my seat postion to make it safer to get on and off. The padded front head rest is genius! If your child gets tired they can just rest their head without flopping around. Also the harness is secure, adjustable, and comfortable. Lastly, I think this was made in the USA which is a plus for me in this ecomomy. A Great buy!
0141442034|5.0|Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.<br />  The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.<br />  The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.<br />  Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.<br />Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.<br />  The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life.siecle London.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Of course, when stood up next to A Rush of Blood and Parachutes, this album doesn't seem as inventive, but it's Coldplay, and they have created and eased into their own sound. X&Y was excellent too, but it's not packed with singles like the other 3.    Viva is one of those albums that the first time you listen to it, you will ask yourself why you bought it. The sounds are slightly different, and there is a large Asian influence on this album, so it's not your everyday Coldplay at first. All of the songs are interesting in their own right, it just depends on what your tastes are. Most of the songs are focused on Chris's voice and simple, but complex sounds (mixing drums and bass in with background tracks).     I definitely recommend this album to ANY Coldplay fan (why don't you have it yet if you are?) and anyone who is looking to expand their horizons. Awesome album.
0385341008|5.0|I put off reading this book because the title did not appeal to. How shallow I am.<br />It is on our book club list so the deed had to be done.  I had just finished reading Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay, a very moving and hard to put down novel. In telling someone about it, they mentioned that TGLAPPPS had some World War II themes and how much they enjoyed it. I popped out and got a copy and that quickly finished the book.<br />  The humour is what dragged me in. Juliet Ashton, the center of the piece, is a 32 year old writer in 1946 in London. The changes to her life in 9 months brought on by the letters she writes and receives is the basis of the book.  I won't give anything else away. I just advise you all to get a copy and read.
0374530718|3.0|Not impressed at all. As a brief introduction to philosophy it's ok I guess. But the instructional goal was intertwined with a story that, in my humble opinion, is rather shallow and lame. Moreover, that \\"literary\\" part of the book involves some uncalled for mystic metafiction that in my opinion was rather poorly realized. I jotted down numerous :rolleyes: notes all over the book. Wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather recommend \\"[[ASIN:8441414254 Antimanual de Filosofia / Antimanual Philosophy: Lecciones Socraticas y Alternativas / Socratic and Alternative Lessons (Ensayo) (Spanish Edition)]]\\" by Michel Onfray, even though I have only browsed it superficially, but seems to be a much more promising book for introducing philosophy to a similar audience, without extraneous literary attempts.

1416955070|5.0|This is an amazing urban fairy tale set in New York, NY.  I have to stop here and say how much I love the fact that the city takes a role as backdrop, and that it is always great to see authors who give an homage to a place and describe what it's actually like to live there as a part of their novels.  The author adeptly applies the world of fairy and the supernatural to the urbane environment and creates a world that is absolutely splendid.  This aspect of the novel was extremely well done.<br /><br />The novel starts off with Clary, the main character, and her best friend Simon out at a club together in the city.  While they are out, Clary witnesses something supernatural and she (and her \\"sight\\") is discovered by three Shadowhunters named Alec, Isabel and Jace.  Shadowhunters are a race of people called Nephilim and supposedly have angel blood.  The fact that Clary witnesses something supernatural sets her apart to the Shadowhunters because, since she is supposed to be a \\"mundane,\\" she should not be able to see through the glamour or guise that hides the supernatural world from normal people.  This one event, coupled with the attack and kidnapping of her mother, puts in motion a chain of events that change Clary's life forever.  Her eyes are opened up to a whole new world that she has to struggle both to be a part of and reconcile with her old life.<br /><br />The romantic tension between Jace and Clary builds throughout the book and is the main romantic focus, although there are love triangles GALORE.  Really, it's kind of ridiculous if you really start to put it all down.  Clary likes Jace, Simon likes Clary; Simon dates Isabel, but likes only Clary; Jace wants Clary, Alec wants Jace; Magnus likes Alec, Alec likes Jace.  Jeez.  It's like love triangle inbreeding or overlapping or something.  But it does make a good bit of drama and serve as motivation for characters throughout the book, so it is just a kind of blanket drama that goes on while all the real action takes place as well. Like real life, I guess.<br /><br />This novel is a good package overall considering that there is plenty of action, romance, some violence and conflict, some heroism, and there are quite a few humorous witticisms from Jace and Magnus.  Magnus is not my fav character in this book, even though I do like him, but he is one of my favorites in the later installments.  Now I absolutely love Magnus Bane, the high warlock of Brooklyn, as a character.well. Like real life, I guess.

0060558121|4.0|Wow, what an unusual story.  Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, this novel fits best in the genre of fantasy.  At its core, it is the story of a battle between two groups of Gods.  The first group is comprised of all the old, mythological Gods who were previously worshipped in days long past.<br /><br />According to the story, they (and various other mythical beings) were transported to the New World (North America) by the beliefs of immigrants, whose descendants gradually forgot them and stopped worshipping and sacrificing to them (think leprechauns, Odin, African deities, Queen of Sheba, etc.).  These Gods, in the form of normal humans (Loki Lie-Smith, Norse God of Chaos becomes \\"Low Key\\" Lyesmith), are greatly weakened, down on their luck and get by through grifting, trickery and minor magic, in addition to holding regular human jobs to make ends meet.<br /><br />Now, there is a new group of glitzy, aggressive Gods, represented by computers, television, internet, video games; you get the picture.  There is a storm brewing between the two sets of Gods and an all out War is on the horizon.<br /><br />In this mix is tossed Shadow, a small time felon recently sprung from prison.  He is picked up by an unusual fellow named Wednesday (Odin) and falls in with the Old Gods.  Did I mention that this was a highly unusual story?  Regardless, it is very well written, and though a little bit over the top, entertaining.  I'm sure there is symbolism and allegory enough to fill a semester length literature class, but strictly from an entertainment perspective, it passes the test.<br /><br />There are several story threads that come together in an ending which contains several very well presented plot twists and satisfactory resolutions.  Some have compared Gaiman's writing style to that of Stephen King, and I confess that there are some similarities.  There is certainly enough originality in this story, however to fill several King novels.
045122499X|2.0|It pains me to write this review. I have loved almost all of Ken Follett's works - and \\"Pillars\\" is one of my absolute favorites. I was hesitant to read \\"World Without End\\" because of some of the negative reviews and I am sorry to report that they were not unjust.    What captured me in \\"Pillars\\" was the strength of the characters, their misfortunes, and their resolve. Not a single character in \\"World\\" drew me in enough to care about them. Every single character is a vicious trollop -- and for no apparent reason. Much of the sexual content added nothing to the plot whatsoever, except to make it seem like no one was capable of any self-control. There was no clear hero, heroine, villian -- it was a complete hodge-podge of nonsense.    Maybe I am a simpleton, but I want novels to have strong characters who have sensible motivations. The only motivation in this story was sex, which is odd, given that everyone seemed to be having it all the time. The final plot twist? What was the point? How did it relate to anyone? It was anti-climatic, a real let-down after waiting the whole story for something, ANYTHING, significant to happen.    The only reason I conceded to give this 2 stars and not 1 is that I did manage to finish the book and have some minimal satisfaction at some of the outcomes. All in all, I was highly, highly disappointed.
0143116371|4.0|The book captures Sart's really great eye for people and style.  Long term fans of the blog will recognize a lot of the photos in the book, and it'll feel like seeing pictures from a great party thrown a few years ago.  The pictures are truly timeless, and should inspire a look into your own closet.  If there is one complaint with the book, it's that it should have been made into a coffee table tome, not a relatively small paperback.  Maybe Scott will put out a larger second edition?  Seeing some of the wittier comments about each photo might also be nice, and capture the interactive nature of a blog.
0385341008|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book.  The format of letters catches your interest, but it can be picked up and put down at any point.  It sheds light on a place and time that most of us are not familiar - the island of Guernsey and 1946 post-war Britain.  It has a nice little romance added and appealing characters.  It's a good mix of thought-provoking stories of the wartime years and light-hearted current events.

B000GCFX3Q|2.0|I was hungry to read another Marian Keyes book after I finished Rachel's Holiday and when I saw the description for Watermelon, I was sure this was the one.  Sadly it was not to be.  The idea of a woman triumphing over the trauma of being pregnant and ditched by her husband especially coupled with a family described as strange but humourous in the last book... well it just sounded like magic waiting to happen.  Instead it turned into a very long, whiney, and predictable hellish journey.  I know this is \\"chick lit\\" so I am ok with predictable but the 3000 diversions in the story, while we hear Claire's thoughts as they drift into every whimsical nook and craney was just TOO much.  Truth be told I think the author must have gotten bored with the story and unlikeable main character while writing the book, so she just tried to fill the pages.    I actually sighed in relief at the end.  I was just too happy to be getting to the next book.  I give it the two stars because there were pockets of entertainment that made me want to finish the book but boy was I happy when it was finally done.

B002KT3XH6|3.0|This review pertains only to the KINDLE edition of this book.  I have not read other editions.  The Kindle edition has been frustrating to read because of typos and inconsistencies in the text that I think are inherent in the Kindle edition.  There are paragraph breaks in midsentence, words strung together with no spaces in between, and the dates are typed very oddly.  For instance, virtually all month/year combos are written as \\"September 1 509.\\"  Years by themselves come out as \\"1 50 9,\\" \\"1 5 0 9\\" or \\"15 09.\\"  It just disrupts the flow as you are reading, especially when you have to stop to figure out whether they are trying to represent a month/day/year, or just the month/year.  I know Kindle is relatively new, but I'm baffled as to why it seems like these editions are being produced with OCR software, rather than as true digital editions licensed from the publisher (and based on digital files).  Either way, it's time for better proofreading!
B000683VI4|1.0|I borrowed my sister in laws DVD of this movie cause everyone told me how romantic it was. What they neglectecd to inform me was that it was an emotional roller coaster through out the movie in which I wanted to kick my tv, plus I didnt know I'd need to watch it with a whole box of tissues. I was either mad or cried throughout the entire movie! But I figured it was ok as long as it had a happy ending. I'm not gonna say too much there for those of you who hasnt see it yet, but what the heck was that ending about? That was soooo sad I was blubbering like a baby. Needless to say, after the movie I was so upset I actually threw the remote  control. I have now boycotted the movie from my house. A little drastic you say? Not to somebody who used an entire box of kleenex throughout the movie. In closing, hated the movie! Watch at your own risk. (and with tissues)

It is a great album, full of wonderful, very catchy songs.  The title track, \\"I Look To You,\\" is a beautiful song, that lets Whitney's strong vocals shine.  \\"I didn't know my own strength,\\" is another great ballad that truly shows, Whitney was not 'built to break'.  She also does a great cover of the song \\"A Song for You,\\" and also shows strength in the last track \\"Salute.\\"  Whitney did a good job on this album, even though her voice isn't what it once was, it's still strong, and she can still hold the notes.

0439023491|5.0|Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark set the hearts of Panem on fire when they found a way to both win The Hunger Games and defy the evil Capitol. As they return home they discover that an uprising among the districts has begun and President Snow is doing everything in his power to quench it. Katniss and Peeta are beginning to realize that winning the Hunger Games by no means assures them of safety. In a desperate move President Snow wipes out any hope of protection and security for the two champions and their loved ones. Can the hope of a nation be silenced before the nation fights back?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins left me in utter and complete awe with her phenomenal debut, The Hunger Games. With reckless abandon I tore into this sequel with strong hopes that I would be enthralled yet again. Thankfully, Collins does not disappoint. Not even close!<br /><br />What I loved about Catching Fire was that Collins didn't try to top herself. Instead of attempting to write a better novel, she focused on giving us even more story. The Hunger Games brought us so much action, romance, adventure, and suspense and all of those elements are found in perfect doses here. We're actually treated to more character development this time around, making the aforementioned elements work seamlessly together.<br /><br />I'll admit that I expected the story to head in a different direction and I was a bit surprised when I realized exactly where Collins was taking us. Some might suggest this is a somewhat gimmicky move for a sequel, but Collins's strong writing sold me completely on the idea and I never looked back. In the end we are left with a gut wrenching longing for the finale, where it seems like things are heading towards an explosive ending.<br /><br />I am totally hooked on this series and I can't wait to put these novels into everyone's hands. If you're looking for sharp storytelling, characters to root for, villains to loathe, and relentless action then this is the series for you.

They go to seminars - they hire financial / business counselors like me - they buy books / courses / 'how to' programs.<br /><br />They can't seem to find the right 'prescription' for financial wellness.  And not much wonder, because I can say this categorically - our public education systems are \\"bankrupt\\" as far as teaching any REAL practical skills in personal finance and business management. Even MBA programs fall short.  Most people today are 'searching' for more success, financial security and happiness in their lives. But many struggle with major challenges, roadblocks and setbacks.

For example, thoughts, feeling, actions equal results. Rich people focus on opportunities - poor people focus on obstacles.

B001AQTWF2|1.0|Whitney, we have waited 7 years for this and 3 years for you to record this. Anyone who says this is great work or even mediocore I say has a character flaw or better yet music flaw. There is absolutely nothing noteworthy here other than \\"I Look To You,\\" which you would have ripped when you were in your prime (\\"Bodyguard\\" era). You are in desperate need of  better material, and I sadly say whoever (Clive)  was the overseer of this project missed the mark greatly. This music sounds like pure bubblegum with all the artificial flavoring. The appearance on Good Morning America did not help as well. You should have cancelled and rested up for your comeback debut \\"All Eyes Where On You,\\" and you knew your were sounding like that before hand. You are a professional singer of many years and talking all day on Oprah Winfrey did not make your voice fried. I'm praying for ya, but this is pure garbage. I hate I spent $10.81 on this cd.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I constantly search for good comedy and am not often rewarded. I bought the complete first season of The Big Bang Theory  totally based on reviews -without ever having seen anything of it. After having seen it, my words to the few bad reviewers  would be the same as Sheldon, \\"You might want to get a cat scan.\\" -or Leonard, \\"What's wrong with you!!!!\\" This is a truly  hilarious and unique series! I see a lot of comparisons to Seinfeld or Friends, -No way Jose! This is in a totally different   class and blows them away. I am on about my 10th time through the DVD and still laughing, -and that takes a lot. I also bought   the complete first season of Chuck based on \\"hilarious\\" reviews and did not get one chuckle. How about this- What if we made a   series that actually made people think about the vast universe they live in and gave them some food to awaken their feeble and  dormant curiosities? Well this does it. The cast was in sync from the get go, and there is not one bad episode in the batch.  You can bet I have preordered season 2 and will do so with season 3 when available!  The thing I am most curious about is how anyone could not love this. But then, some of us evolve and some don't.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|Most of this film is structured as a courtroom drama.  It begins just after the death of Emily Rose in the home of her shattered family as the priest who was acting as her exorcist is arrested by the police.<br /><br />A very intriguing opening.<br /><br />And there's no actress better than Laura Linney as the defense attorney hired to defend the priest in a negligent homicide trial.  As Emily's story is told in flashbacks during the trial's testimony, the viewer, like Linney's character, begins to realize that the most unbelievable aspect of the case--that demons and evil exist outside of ourselves--might just be at the bottom of the case.<br /><br />Excellent performances from everyone, sharp writing.  This film doesn't have the overwhelming dread that THE EXORCIST left with audiences but its ambition is a little more involved: it asks questions for the audience to answer for themselves.<br /><br />If you're looking for an artless, empty slaughter house of a horror movie, then move on.  There are plenty of slasher and zombie fests out there.<br /><br />But if you're looking for an intelligent, well-made film that doesn't limit itself to one side or another, then check this one out.
B00003CXFV|3.0|Julia Roberts gives an excellent and Oscar worthy performance of real-life character Erin Brockovich who in finding a way to make ends meet stumbles upon a case of big corporate bully and exploiter of the innocent against the simple folk and serves as the catalyst in putting ambulance chasing to good use for a change.  In stark contrast to the beginning of the show where Erin fails to take advantage of ambulance chasing on the small scale with her traffic accident claim the huge payoff she gets at the end of the show where she presumably helps more people than just herself and her kids seems to argue a case for the necessity of this particular form of legal practice to protect the little guy who would otherwise have no way to seek proper justice.<br /><br />It is indeed amazingly hypocritical for Americans to decry poisonous Chinese-made toys and/or melamine laced candy when they themselves are poisoning their own citizen's drinking water however this in no way excuses the Chinese situation naturally although it is interesting to see just how if given a chance American companies would happily kill innocents for the almighty dollar without a second thought.<br /><br />This dvd has good special features such as interviews with Erin herself as well as a making-of documentary.  The picture and sound quality are both good without any obvious blemish to report.  It's hard to resist an underdog makes good story like this one and for this reason, this film ages pretty well.  Not the best film I've ever seen but certainly not the worst either.

0439023491|5.0|I absolutly LOVED this book! I pre-ordered it, got it the day after it was released, and finished it a couple days later.  But i liked the characters, and relation ships more in this book, how they were more developed.  Love the series! I can't wait for the 3rd one to come out!
B00129H7VS|5.0|This series RULES. It really gave you a feel for the personal sacrifice the men of easy company. Great Mini Series.

Then I was watching PBS one night, and there he was in his famous concert from London. I was immediately hooked and bought the double CD \\"Live in London\\" I am a big fan now...lol...Great CD..I love it...Hugs..Otto
0739384171|5.0|This book is the second of three in Larsson's series featuring Lisbeth Salander, the young woman who has her own sense of morality and acts on it accordingly.  As this book opens, we find young Lisbeth in the Caribbean after the events of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  Meanwhile, the erstwhile reporter Kalle Blomkvist and the team at Millennium are sitting on top of a goldmine of a story. With the help of a woman who is finishing her  PhD thesis and that of her husband, who is writing a book based on her findings,  Blomkvist is ready to publicly uncover a scandal in which some high-ranking officials are involved in sex trafficking from Russia and other parts of eastern Europe into Sweden.  Eventually Lisbeth returns home, and goes into hiding.  After a triple homicide, the police become interested in finding her (as does Blomkvist) because the clues at the murder scenes lead directly back to her.  At this point, Blomkvist, who is absolutely convinced that Lisbeth is innocent, begins his own investigation, working from a different starting point than that of the police.<br /><br />I love Lisbeth's character -- she refuses to be a victim even though her life is on the line.  She's a take-charge kind of person, apologizing to no one, and she is definitely an example of someone whose past has created her present.  She's a heroine unlike any other you'll find in crime writing -- very flawed, dark, unafraid, with a sense of morality that she acts on even if it goes against the social grain.  There are very few people in her life whom she trusts, and definitely has no love for official institutions. The book is fast paced, with never a dull moment, and is a solid sequel to Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  I would definitely recommend that anyone thinking about this book start with Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, because there are a number of references in the 2nd book that you won't understand if you don't, and because once things start unraveling, you need to have the background of events from the first book, especially with the relationship between Lisbeth and Blomkvist.<br /><br />Girl Who Played With Fire leaves some things hanging, which I'm sure will be picked up in the upcoming third book (hopefully, since it's the last one).  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, solid mystery novel and who doesn't mind that the characters are all a bit flawed.  Not a cozy mystery at all, so if that's what you're looking for, skip it.  Otherwise, sit back and try to clear your day because you won't want to put this one down. Fans of Scandinavian crime novels will absolutely not be disappointed.events from the first book, especially with the relationship between Lisbeth and Blomkvist.

B001R10BMS|4.0|1983 was a big year; especially for movies with 3s (Return of the Jedi, Superman, Jaws and even this, Connery's third final Bond film). Not only that, it was the Battle of the Bonds. EON Productions \\"official\\" Roger Moore film Octopussy vs. the triumphant return of Sean Connery in this \\"unofficial\\" remake of Thunderball (due to a lawsuit of Kevin McClory against Ian Fleming then Cubby Broccoli). Though many plot elements are similar (the theft of two nuclear warheads, SPECTRE, Domino, etc.), there are also a lot of differences. Largo (played by Klaus Maria Brandauer) is a philanthropist, whose vessel The Flying Saucer (the English translation of Largo's boat from Thunderball Disco Volante) is a fully functional villain hideout, which is one of the pluses of the film. Another plus is to the characterization of Largo. In the first film, he was more intimidating and involved. In this, he's slightly insane (even admitting to it in one of my favorite scenes). But he's also involved and very sophisticated, who doesn't let Bond's antics seem to bother him as much as in Thunderball. Domino (played by Kim Basinger) I'm kind of on the fence. In this she pretty much wants to be with Largo (though insinuating earlier that she might leave him, though only playfully bringing it up) and doesn't seem to mind being his mistress until Bond tells her about the death of her brother. In Thunderball, she's much more vulnerable and emotional towards Bond and actually doesn't like being kept around by Largo. And when it comes to evil henchwomen, Fiona Volpe wins out over Fatima Blush (played by Barbara Carrera). Carrera plays Blush to over the top but she does mix elements of Volpe and future Bond bad girl, Xenia Onatopp. As far as action goes, this ones very light on it. The fight in the health spa could've been trimmed a bit. And even though the motorcycle chase doesn't have any gadgets, its still quite exciting. And the final assault on Largo is also quite fun and exciting, saving the big explosvies for the finale. And lastly, music wise, this is near the bottom of my list (but above DAD and QOS). The music is jazzier and can be, at least to me, quite obnoxious. It doesn't seem like a Bond score at all (which may be the effect they were going for anyway, but at least David Niven's Casino Royale had a big brassy score. Coincidentally Herb Alpert, who played the theme of that film) does have a solo in the end credits). And Lani Hall's voice I just don't like, she sounds off key sometimes to me. I wish they used the recently discovered unused theme performed by Phyllis Hyman, now that sounded like a Bond song.ig explosvies for the finale.

B0015KO52S|5.0|I got this album because Jack White became one of the Raconteurs.  I expected to only like Jack White.  Much to my surprise, I really like the Raconteurs and especially this album.  Although Jack's CAROLINA DRAMA end tune on this album became my top fave almost immediately, I soon found that I also was listening to Brendan's FADE TO BLACK quite often.  This song made it onto the NPR listeners' top 25 songs for 2008.  Then I found that I really like the first track, then the third track, especially with the piano opening and close and so on.  Now I listen to all of them and so I am hooked.<br /><br />I can't recall another recording artist (than White) who has branched out to this extent with other artists.  Plus there have been no permanent, bitter fallings out.  White has one guise with THE WHITE STRIPES, another with THE RACONTEURS, has just joined DEAD WEATHER and issued an album with them in 2009, and has worked singly with other artists on single recordings from the likes of Mick Jagger to Alicia Keys to Loretta Lynn.  In all of this, he never insists on titling the record \\"Jack White and the {name of band}\\".  I think that is very smart because there have been no giant breakups with anyone and he has left all musical doors open.  Thus, as a fan, I can look forward to seeing him issue albums with many different other artists and blend his sound with theirs.  I wish other recording artists would take the hint and do the same.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).
