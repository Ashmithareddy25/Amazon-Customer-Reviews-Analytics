B00CWRF1S0|5|great set to have in the collection in general, makes brake jobs that mush easier  and faster once you are aware how to set up the tool
B0002KKTFO|5|This is a thousand times better than those $10 guns you get at the auto or discount store. Go ahead and spend the extra money - its worth it. Works first time, every time. Easy to load. Well built quality construction. Will use for years to come.
B00C6MWEEU|5|Good oem style torque mount
B000ELF61S|5|best wheel cover I have ever purchased.  Better than OE
B004NFU3C8|5|Works great!
B0023VFIZ6|5|Very pleased with the product and price. Although I'm not a mechanic, it worked beautifully.
B001TIS3K6|5|I am using the Winegard with Dish Network HD. I also bought the SunForce AC adapter so I can plug the satellite into my generator.<br /><br />When I started tailgating at University of Kentucky football games I was not ready to spend this much money on a satellite that I might only use 10 times a year. So I bought a regular Dish and tripod kit on ebay for around $100 and tried that. I am a pretty tech savvy guy who runs his own cable and all my friends and family come to me for answers to their electronics questions. SO I thought I could handle setting up the dish every week. And I was very wrong. With a mobile satellite system the setup with be slightly different everytime. I tailagte in teh same spot every week, but trying to get the satellite in the exact same spot week after week is impossible especially if you are like me and have to fold everything up to transport it. I gave up after a year of only getting all my channels once with a standard dish. So I saved and bought the winegard. This Auto system has completely changed my tailgating experience. What last year took me 45 min to 1.5 hours now only takes me setting the winegard on the top of my truck and letting it scan for 5 minutes and I am watching High Definition TV. It couldn't be easier. While I am embarressed of how much I paid, anyone who has tried to set-up a traditional dish at a football game understands and agrees with the decision. I have people come over all the time and ask about it and say it is completely worth the money since with a normal dish they are getting no signal after 2 hours. One group next to me never got their old dish and tripod to work even though they brought it and tried every game of the season. I expect to see them with a Wingard next season.
B002H97L3G|5|Worked great for me. Thats All there is to say :)
B0032Z1JDM|5|These lights are really good and works as advertised but be sure to get good ballasts. The slim ones are not good at all and the thicker ones break from time to time but are the better option. I would definitely recommend the lights themselves though
B000OQHVGG|3|I like the mats and they are good quality but they are not at all the same color that the picture shows.  They are a darker pink around the out side and then a pink/orange color on the inside part.  The color was a little upsetting because I thought they would be all hot pink like the picture shows.
B007VXCYXA|5|I replaced my bezels because owner before me thought he was a paint pro and decided to rattle can them black. Looked horrible. Bought these flat black replacements and found installation easy once you get a hang of how they come out. They pop in real easy and sit tight around tail light. I got these in 2 days because of prime. Ordered on weds. on back of car by friday. I really would like to see ppl stop trying to rattle can stuff on their car. Its one thing if you have a hoopty civic, but these are $40-$50k cars lets do things the right way and stop trying to save 10 bucks. If you were worried about money i dont think you would be driving a camaro. Turned out great and i didnt have to spend all day sanding and prepping and priming. Worth 10 bucks to me.
B005N53C9I|3|I have to say, my Jeep Wrangler (TJ) seats were getting to &#34;that&#34; stage. What stage you ask? The stage were you are afraid to sit in them because they might soil your clothing. Yeah, that stage. A year of doing Crossfit workouts (WOD's for the uninitiated) and then driving home while completely soaking wet with sweat will do that....<br />Anyways, back to the topic at hand, seat covers. As far as seat covers go, this one totally covers my seat. I really couldn't ask for more. My only complaint is that upon installation, the product failed me.To install this bad boy, it has a special flap that goes through the middle area of your car seat (also known as the black hole of death (for phones and spare change at least)) and connects on the other end. I believe that the initial designer put this feature in to create a more &#34;snug&#34; fit. Alas, as I forced my little brother (6) to grab the flap on the back end of the seat while I jammed it through the hole, it broke. It broke (as in this flap became permanently unattached from the seat cover apparatus) because my little 6 year old brother pulled on it too hard. Now, keep in mind, he is a strong 6 year old (at least that's what my parents say), but I would think that this seat cover would be a tad more robust. Since this feature broke, I decided to tie whatever others straps are part of this seat cover to my seat. Seems to fit well. Cushy. Not coated in sweat. Big benefits in my book.<br /><br />Excellent fabric though! Whatever fabric is.
B00496Z394|5|have not used as yet keeping it as spare just in case.. great deal for cost..
B002YQV18S|5|Silver finish and trim - emblem size is 5 x 1¾ inches with peel & stick foam adhesive - can be applied to any clean flat surface -vehicles, doors, mailboxes, glass, metal, etc
B0080KN7RU|5|Great on my laptop.
B004NY1DHS|4|The instructions are not that clear about how to install this, but once you figure it out, it isn't that hard. This is a bit inconvenient as it dangles just above the belt hook and can interfere with the belt retracting all the way up to the side pillar if it is up the belt very far and then it bangs around. In use I found it to make a big difference in feeling more secure, especially at Willow Springs Track day last weekend. It's well worth it to have, but I think it's a bit over priced. I think it should sell for about $45 with shipping, not $65!
B003VXN5U0|5|Great product. All of the useful items are stores in easily, And now it won't clutter the cab or the bed. Nice and organized.
B0009IQXXG|5|Works just like I expected it to. All the Meguiar's products are very good!!
B001AIZ5HY|5|the 3M 380008 headlight Lens Resto worked great.  was pleased with results with little time, I did 2 headlights on my VW Passat, only spent about 20 minutes plus.  Could have spent more time for even better result.  but they're a LOT better than they were.  they look nearly good as new, again TONS better than before, not sure if I have the patience to spend 30 min plus on each light to get an even better result.  very pleased
B00LMBDPSA|5|Yes...exactly what I l was looking for my 2014 Nissan Rogue SL. It matched the chrome trimming  on SUV.
B00EUM5YEQ|2|I saw this item at a auto zone a while back ordered them from Amazon a couple weeks later.<br />Smells great with the heat blowing, but after your car sits for a while it leaves a odd smell I don't like.<br />Might try a different scent and see what happens.
B000GRR4OC|4|Nice small size, many little pockets and a large, removable, map pouch. Tenacious magnets. It's not likely to come off.... Ever
B000JFJMFK|4|The Engineers at Ford are stupid for coming up with a design that requires, for either tech or DIYers out there, to crawl under the car to replace the damn transmission fluid.  Also, the hatch panel that is cracked in almost 99% of the explorer that are on the road.
B008G30OS6|5|Good quality great customer service
B00029XGIM|5|Works great, replaced my stock horn on my Honda VTX 1300
B004SSEOQG|5|Ordered on a friday and wasn't expecting for at least a week, and it came early. love the quality and will definitely use for a long time.
B00ED5OY4G|4|Perfect looks good on my car
B000C5403G|5|Quality construction and an exact fit for my 2006 TJ.  The un-worn-out bushing in the new track bar cured my death-wobble quite nicely.
B00HWON0FO|1|They are plastic not worth it
B000OAG2DK|4|It works well.  It is easy to install.
B0041E89GI|4|great price and fit perfect
B00KLIWMCU|5|I must say that this wind shield sun shade works very well. It covers my entire wind shield on my Kia Optima. It's easy to fold and put away as soon as you get a hang of it. I would purchase this product again from this company in the future. This seller shipped my product right away.
B000EPT390|5|Fit right and easy to install in our 2009 HHR.
B003089Y1K|4|Very pretty for my mirror.
B00HZSL98M|5|I love smiley's
B0000AY2BR|5|Works great! Bright too!
B00A1UT7I0|5|Just got this and put it on my truck.  Great quality, easy to apply and can't wait to pull up next to someone's minivan with their stick family!
B007LICBF6|5|I'll admit, this frame looked a little thin when it arrived, and I didn't have high hopes for it's longevity.  But I put it on my new Camry anyway, and it looks great.  Unfortunately, both the old screws that I used and the license plate itself rusted, staining the frame and the paint underneath it on my white car.  It's been 1 year, and I finally removed the plate, bought some stainless steel screws, and some rubbing compound to remove the rust stains.  I used a small amount of rubbing compound on the frame itself and it came totally clean and shines like brand new.  It was a great purchase and I definitely would buy it again. Well worth the money!
B00HRIHYOS|5|Works awesome!!
B000C822PQ|5|nice item
B00VDM8B9G|1|Ordered the standard waving flag and the reversible for opposite displays.  Both were supposed to be 3x5.  Reverse wave is no where close to the same size as the standard wave.  This is now useless to me.
B008Z6AEE8|5|I was very pleased with the product. In brand new condition, great packaging, it came quickly. The only thing is make sure your measurements are correct. My measurements were for a size medium, but when i received it and tried it on, it would slide down a little. With a few adjustments its much better now. I would order again.
B0081OSS2Y|5|Good
B000C59MFM|4|Unless you plan on spending a great deal more money I don't really think you will be getting much more bang for the buck!
B009I0BMA0|5|I installed these on a 2014 Dodge Durango. The say fitment 2011-2013, but they fit the 2014 also. This is a genuine Dodge part so it fits perfectly and installation was easy, took about 20 mnts to install. You need a 10MM socket, screwdriver and a drill to drill a small hole in the trucks plastic fender liner. No drilling in metal though, which could cause corrosion issues. Why aren't these on the truck from the factory?? Should be a standard part for sure!
B00FD90XK0|5|Will do the job just fine.
B004FST92I|5|A+++
B00723REIY|3|It's the same as others but it's NOT manufactured by Chrysler Corporation- it's an &#34;aftermarket&#34;. Therefore, Chrysler & the dealers won't &#34;guarantee&#34; it or the programming if you need to take it to a dealer for programming as I did.  The description doesn't warn you that a working remote is required for programming & I purchased this as a replacement for the manufacturer's remote because mine got lost my spare wasn't working.  When I got to the dealer they at first said they wouldn't program it & to send it back because it wasn't a manufacturer's remote, but I argued it & they said they wouldn't guarantee the programming so if it didn't I'd be out $60. I ended up spending $240 at the dealer in the end: $160 for a Chrysler manufactured remote so that I was sure to have a working remote; $60 to get the 2 remotes programmed. As it turned out, this remote did program so I have a spare, but this shouldn't be listed as a &#34;Jeep-Chrysler&#34; remote.  It should be called &#34;Keyless Entry Remote FOR Jeep Liberty&#34;, & state that it's an aftermarket product that requires a working remote to be programmed.
B000WJDFNS|5|As good or better than OEM for my Honda CRF 250X.  I have always been happy with Motion Pro products
B00JY03Y8M|3|I just installed these Nerf Bars and I love it.  It came flat black (which I hoped it was) and mounts right to the body of my 2015 4Runner.  Installation instructions explains how to install it but soon realized that the instructions were wrong.  Instruction states to install Nerf Bars with bent flange facing towards the rear of vehicle, but in actuality, they don't fit that way.  All I did was switch the Bars, having the bent flange face towards the front.  Item came with hardware.  Overall 5 stars for Item.  1 star for delivery promise date.  It would have been nice if someone at 1800CarParts.com could email me if the item was on back order.  Thus the 3 star rating.
B001UC729O|4|I like it.  Changing out the original, still working alternator was a bit of a pain because the latch on the belt tensioning pully wouldn't latch - but that's the truck's fault, not the alternator's.  It's only been on the truck for a couple of days so I can't say how long of a life it will have at this point.  The best way to get the belt pulled out so you can latch the tensioner pully is to use a framer's claw hammer with claws that stick out straight from the back of the hammer head.  Then hold the hammer with the left hand and reach long bar down in there to flip the tensioner latch.<br /><br />If installing on a Ford 6.0 diesel, there are two other things you should do.  First, also order a smaller diameter pully for the alternator.  They're also on Amazon.  The smaller pully gives you higher output at an idle because the alternator turns faster.  Second, From the green output connection on the back of the alternator, run a second red / positive cable to the positive terminal on the driver's side battery.  The cable needs to be 19&#34; long from eye to eye on the terminals.  We have a good shop in Anchorage that makes cables while you wait for a few minutes - Go Polar Wire.  Preferably have the cable made from #6 cable.  Leave the factory cable in place.  The problem with it is Ford went really cheap on a small cable, it can't carry the amperage needed.  There's room on both the alternator and battery terminal to install the second cable.
B004I9MD2M|5|Best price I could find...would prefer without branding but...
B001O0XN36|5|Great product fast shipping
B004BCJBY4|3|Fit and finish of the headlight housing was good, however the plastic weight is much lighter than stock units.  Once installed one single light did not work and the other headlight assemblies park/single lamps were way too bright.  The units come with bulbs and sockets installed.  I replaced all light bulbs and sockets with the ones from my original headlights.  Everything is back to normal.
B009IZ8RTO|5|I ordered these for my daughters car, and when replacing her well worn original brake pads, I noticed these were almost an exact replica of the original equipment in fit and finish! They fit the calipers perfectly, have all the same dimensions on both pad and backing plate, and work as well so far as the original pads did. I would highly recommend these brake pads as replacements for the original pads! After seeing how they have worn in the past 5,000+ miles, they are showing very little wear, making no extraneous noises, and have not shown heat fade when braking for extended periods of time here in AZ!
B005DSOENI|5|Product shipped fast and was packaged well.  This look great on my CTS!!  Thank you for a great item!
B000667QL4|1|I used this ONCE with water only. Bottom inside melted where heating element is. It melted while heating the water! Please do not waste your money!
B000E5U4O8|5|Unit is noticeably smaller then the factory one in my 2012 Tiguan TSi. The cost of buying this unit now will save you money over time in avoiding replacement paper filters. They say you get better gas millage as well and although this speculatory and would love to see some real data I think I'm getting more millage out of the tank.<br /><br />Cons: You have to clean and oil this filter as recomended or things will be worse. Also the K&N will let larger dirt particles into your engine.
B0059HJHS0|5|GOOD
B004ALFZBE|5|Replacement
B004BFBK2W|3|PLEASE READ THE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ATTACHED TO THIS REVIEW, BEYOND MY ORIGINAL POSTING.    We bought the kit that included the suction cups which are needed for vehicles with fiberglass hatches, tail gates, etc.  The suction cups are connected to a triangle metal plate which substitutes a metal plate for the camera unit to stick to.  The suction cup adapter fell off the glass window of a Tahoe. We then wet the suction cups with basically the same result.  The magnetic base camera unit has a tendency to slide on all metal surfaces that I tried.  This is not good....  The actual magnet in the base of the unit is recessed ever so slightly so that actual metal to magnet contact is not achieved.  The magnetic \\"force\\" causes some magnetic field to hold it in place but the vibrations from backing up the car cause it to slide.  In other words, the magnet is not strong enough to hold it in place.  I called the manufacturing company and they had no helpful suggestions.  I am going to try and remove the magnet and install a thin spacer to raise the actual magnet above the camera's metal base.  That way, the actual magnet should make contact with a metal surface.  The recession in the base is very minimal, but just enough to weaken the sticking power of the magnet.  I am not exactly sure how I am going to fix the suction cup issue.
B0007VFM82|5|Love these receivers I have purchased 3
B000C9RXSQ|5|Just what I needed at a great price!
B002CNGCZA|5|Ordered set of four came very quickly. Problem one missing package looked like it had been repackaged. Got in touch with them thru E-mail and got response right away. They took care of the problem with speed and understanding. I sent the set back and didn't have to pay postage came right to my door. They made sure I had all the information. I had my new set within the week and they kept in touch with me about getting the first set to them. So I didn't have to worry about a second charge. I am very pleased with service and will use their service again for sure. The fastest and most helpful service I've ever had. Thank-you. I have now had them 3 days shy of a year and they still look as good as when I got them and still going strong.
B000EPY03Y|5|Stops on a dime. Got it with the brakes as well. This is the way to go. Cannot beat the price
B005M2N6QQ|5|It seems silly but these lowered seat frames really do improve your top speed and handling. Lowering your body improves the aerodynamics, which increases your top speed. Also lowering your body weight lowers the center of gravity, which improves the handling.
B00132CH46|4|We purchased this because we wanted to bring our bikes camping and the back hitch was already being used by the camper. It installed pretty easy and works well with our bike rack attachment. It had extra holes that the underside of our expedition did not, but this didn't affect anything. Someday we might use it to attach a winch.<br />So far very happy with It!
B00NUA1UZQ|5|Looks Great and Works Great.
B007W7PFWC|5|Very Happy with Seller and Product
B00DQ1RV70|1|These are clearly advertised as being 57 mm caps, however upon receipt we measure them as closer to 62mm.<br />Needless to say, they do not fit our 2010 Prius' alloy wheels.<br /><br />We received a RMA authorization, but unfortunately we will have to pay $10 for shipping back to China.<br /><br />Buyer beware. If they ship you the wrong size, you're out $10.
B002OARB8I|5|Love the sound of the exhaust system. Looks great too. Took me little longer than what I thought to install on the Concours. Took off 12 pounds from the stock exhaust. Would recommend and by again.
B000C2WIYM|5|This is a top quality, OEM part.  Definitely the least expensive way to purchase this part.  The part is made by the same manufacturer as came on the car from the factory.
B000CLYVA2|5|I replaced my passenger side mirror for my 95 Wrangler YJ Rio Grande. Took a few minutes and Boom mirror was replaced. It's strong and sturdy and I have no complaints.
B008INWF0O|5|This is the best cleaner I have ever used, and I have tried a few in my life.  You cannot beat the convenience of an all in one spray to clean every part of your bike, (excluding the tires) you can clean the forks, tank fenders, frame, mirrors, signals, brake lens and even the windscreen.  Takes off road grime, bugs and water spots with ease without streaking or smearing..<br /><br />I would give it 10 stars if it were available or even a 100% customer satisfaction.
B000OV6L2Q|4|Warn winches are Warn winches, and Tabor is a cheap Warn. No big differences noted so it's well worth the price difference, I wouldn't invest extra money just for the warn sticker on the solenoid. Installation is easy, just 2 cables plugged to the battery and then follow the connections according to the colors. Remote is standard so nothing worth highlighting. I'm using mine with the steel cable (not a synthetic rope) as steel cables are more resistant to friction, although it does add some extra pounds...<br />Didn't rate it 5 stars because Warn is missing the solenoid (solenoid is the black box you see above the winch body)  mount on the packages. Out of the box you won't be able to mount it as it appears in the pictures due to the lack of this mount. Buy it together with the winch or else you'll be frustrated having to start all over once you get it.
B00852684M|1|After a month one died completely, one barely works.
B000GZPCYI|5|It made making filling my forks evenly incredibly easy!
B00OPZLAJ6|1|Does not fit into a 2001 bmw 330i e46. Not because it's the incorrect size, it's just a peice of shit and u realize it right when u open ur package and it says ''made in china.&#34; It is impossible to get the peices to sit into position properly.
B003NTPE9W|3|ok - pricey
B00RM327NG|5|I like it, I will buy two more for other cars.
B008H4QMVW|3|I used this as a replacement when my OEM pad fell of my Hyosung GV250.  It fils well enough I guess, but the chrome brackets are the same size and my sissy bar is slightly angled, so the top fits super snug, and the bottom barely makes it between the posts.  If your bars are parallel, its not an issue.  My only other comment is the back of the pad is just felt, not leather.  I am concerned as to how that will hold up over time in the weather.
B004ZZVM8K|5|Put these in a couple months back. They do tighten  up the feel significantly. Nice little upgrade, just make sure  you soak the bolts in penetrating fluid at least overnight.
B0041U3VQ0|5|it fit and was in my price range .... i will suggest to all my friends to check here first when buying parts. Thanks a lot.
B00BSUE80O|5|Bought for my husband for Father's day and he loved them!
B001B5DBH2|5|I bought this to put in a 4 cylinder 2000 Cougar.  It went in without a hitch and has performed well.  It was HUNDREDS cheaper through Amazon than I could get it in a Virginia auto parts store.  It drives well and was a good choice.
B0089LSFJ0|5|I love it.
B001UOZ190|1|most useless item on earth. It does not do anything than making your car smell for one day and the smell goes away after one day. Do not by this product. Horrible product.
B00AFV7DHW|4|These fit our 2013 Tundra great, work great, mirror is slightly off as far as clarity but husband says they give him the extra view that he needs towing the trailer and all for a great price...have not had any issues with them at all including vibrations and fit...quickly snaps on and off existing mirrors...
B00D9C2CDO|5|We bought Cargo bag for a family trip to Florida from Pennsylvania. We had four Carry on luggages with another medium sized bag fit into this. Setting up was easy though my SUV had only side rails and no cross bars. The bag did not even move during the 30 hours of drive  that we had to do. When the straps are not really taut, noise level was high. Once we tightened the straps, noise level was normal.<br /><br />We had torrential rain on the way and back and not even a drop of water got inside the bag. You need to ensure the flaps are correctly closed using the attached Velcro Fasteners
B001JBHTC6|2|I recently broke the inside door handle on my 1997 Toyota Camry. So I ordered this cheap replacement set. Upon receiving it I realized that the left side door handle (the only one I needed) had a couple nice visible scratches! While the right side was flawless. I was very upset at this, as anyone packaging this could have clearly seen this minor flaw and gave me a better set! I started to return it for just that reason, but was too tired of dealing with my broken handle to make a big deal about it.           My other major gripe is that after taking off the inside door panel, this replacement handle doesn't quite mount flush like the original factory one. No matter how you adjust it, the thing is made a little too deep in the back to mount perfectly flush. Nothing anyone will notice but me, but still poor design! Finally after all is said and done the lock button sticks a little. You sometimes have to play with it a hair to get it to push all the way forward to lock. All in all this part is only good for opening the door. I think with a little extra shopping around a better door handle can be found than this one. The only good thing is that this is a set, so I have a spare for the other side when one breaks.
B001UC7O2Y|5|Great product.  Cheapest price I found.  Bolt-on replacement that fit perfectly.  I now have a freezing A/C and am very pleased.
B006CRT72W|5|Bought a nice used 2009 F-150 and it only came with 1 key and 1 fob.  I was perplexed and irritated but once I found these fobs that were so cheap I wasn't near as irritated.  Bought two of them and had 1 programmed by the dealer and then I programmed the 3rd.  They seem OEM quality to me and when they are this cheap I don't mind if they aren't.
B001RBA1E6|5|love it
B000XBGFO6|5|I saw these suckers so much on the road and i was envious, after looking around at walmart and walgreens i went ahead an ordered these off here. They came a little late, but i still got to show'em off! They looked tiny on my dodge longhorn dully, but i loved them!
B002WHABIU|4|Very good quality item for the price.
B0002MABGE|5|I rarely, if ever leave reviews but I had to for this product. We recently purchased a 2014 Grand Cherokee and were looking for a pet barrier for the dogs. For the price, this product can not be beat. It is high quality, easy to assemble and install, and most importantly the dogs couldn't knock it down. I was slightly worried that it wouldn't be large enough for the cargo area but it fit perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a pet barrier!
B003CX62E0|5|Perfect fit for my 76' Porsche 911S.  Cant beat the price.  Very happy with the purchase.
B00ZAAW5GM|2|[[VIDEOID:daa334f57e0a7684f05ff01bf9560b2a]]This screwdriver set could have been good if not for the following two problems:<br /><br />1) The bits do not stay in their cubby holes, they fall out as soon as the case is tipped. When the package arrived in the mail all bits were out of their slots.<br />2) The screwdriver bits are not marked with sizes.  The cubby holes in which they are supposed to reside are marked, but since the bits do not stay in the cubby holes the markings on the case are of no help.<br /><br />The kit is not totally useless as I can eye ball the bit and do some trial and error for a good fit but it does not work as designed.  Since it was time consuming and annoying having to put the bits back into slots every time I handled the case I came up with a solution of covering the bits with a piece of plastic before closing the case. This keeps most of them in place as I put the case away for storage.<br /><br />The kit does have a large variety of small tips - a larger variety than I my other small screwdriver sets.  However, I am not able to give it an \\"ok\\" rating because of the two problems.  If you are willing to spend a bit more money check out iHuniu screwdriver kit, it is a similar (but smaller) kit with a case that holds everything well and it has tips with engraved sizes.<br /><br />This screwdriver kit is provided by Trendbox with a request for an honest review.  Getting a free product does not effect what I say. My reviews reflect only my experience with the product and reviews are good or bad only based on how well the product works.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
B0073FHYQS|5|Excellent quality!  I had some small scratches from a scrape on a rear fender on my RAV4.  The Pyrite Mica Professional Touch paint product was perfect.  It arrived on time and included a small paint brush, protective glove, and general instructions.  Easy to apply; perfect color match; impossible to see where the scratches were unless you search for it.  Price was great!!!!
B007AAUTG8|5|Installed easily. I found a YouTube video that demonstrated a similar installation that made it easy.<br /><br />Works great. The screen is just big enough to see clearly. It isn't HD, but a good enough.<br /><br />Wireless. Works great too. It would have been a hassle to install wires from back to dash. Plug it in, velcro to the dash. Done.<br /><br />Excellent value.
B000C9444C|5|Exactly what I needed...screw you Advanced Auto Parts!
B0090JVTYI|5|Looks great- matches the interior of my 2011 Tahoe perfectly and fits into console well.
B00F8LEB9W|4|Only one of the two fobs worked.  Still worth the cost.
B000CQHUYG|5|Good high quality material from Dynomax.  I ordered an exhaust system for my Jeep.  The installing mechanic told me the provided clamps were complete junk that wouldn't even tighten.  I found these and when I gave them to the mechanic he marveled at the quality.  Especially since it was a lot cheaper than anything he could have got for me.  You will be pleased.
B00AIXIMX6|5|Love it
B00BGD95HO|1|The specs say these are 5.6mm (0.220&#34;).  The ones I ordered (and received) are much bigger.  The OD of the shank measures 0.310&#34; (7.84mm).  They're worthless for the job I had planned.
B005KDO922|5|What more is there to say. it's a silverstar bulb. It's the best there is. It was just a simple plug and play interiror light for my Jeep Commander
B000C2ZKEM|3|Its a filter, how do you know what it does? item is as described and will install when I purchase fluid.
B000E28MTA|5|Filter fit perfectly on my 2004 Harley Davidson sportster. The chrome adds a nice touch. The great part is that it was no more expensive than other filters.
B00266Z8LW|2|bn ok but ordered the wrong 1`s, looked at 1 i wanted and push the button for the wrong 1
B00E1SOPLC|5|had some squeek for first few miles but nothing since. very happy and wil purchase for my other cars later
B000GPV2QA|3|Most everything works as expected, except the air pump (which is what I use it for the most). After a short time of owning this unit the air compressor started doing some funny things and , now, only works intermittently and for short durations, not over a minute. I have a Stanley 500 amp unit that works like a charm with it's air compressor, but it has shortcomings to, such as how to charge it and no inverter like the Wagan. Everything else works adaquately, but it would be nice that the air compressor did, as well. I am taking off 2 stars for that and the length of time you have to charge the unit (34 hours) and for it's bulk (weighs about 20 lbs). I live on a farm, so it is indispensible, but it not perfect, by any means.
B007H2PH02|5|This is the best product no odor from my camper toilet at all this does the job!!! Super fast shipping as always Amazon delivers super items at super prices!!!  this is the S***
B005EJGSQ2|4|The heated seat cushion came on time and was packed nicely. The cushion fits into my truck nicely and took a few minutes to warm up, but worked good.
B0007IKG1I|1|I tried to use this tool to remove the ball-ends on my 94 BMW 325..  Not a very big car and destroyed the appropriate size pickle head with about a dozen hits with a 3 lb hammer...  The pickle head angles were funky and the tool bent before releasing my ball joints.  The head looks more like a doorstop than a wedge like the better tools.<br /><br />The thing came loose and had to be re-tightened every other hit or so..  The screw-in head is just a bad idea for a tool you hit with a hammer.<br /><br />I had to run to the parts store to buy a single-piece replacement to complete my work.<br /><br />Save your money and buy the more expensive single purpose tool
B0000AY69V|5|I bought this after not being able to find the sham wow that I have been using at the department stores. So I went online and found this.  I gave it a shot as I thought the reviews were good and it was priced right. It is super absorbent and actually shines while it wipes stainless steel surfaces. This is a huge plus as other cloths can sometimes leave a hard water mark as you wipe down surfaces.  If you have been a Shamwow user, you will love this even more.
B006YWYCVG|4|This item was on time and it matched up to the old I was replacing. Would recommend if you are looking for this part for a craftsman riding mower.
B00030LM54|5|I was picking up my boat after a service and attached the sticks to the ball and hitch and backed up so fast; stopped and started to hook up when a customer I had talked with earlier hurried over. He wanted to see what I was using and how I had been so fast to hook up. I teased him a bit about \\"Not having everything after all!\\" he took a picture and said he was getting a pair.<br />I have had the magnet pull off when I pull directly off the ball or hitch. I cant it a bit and then it is not an issue. SOMEDAY I will use a better glue on them.
B006H6XGVG|4|I have a V-star 950, and I bought these brackets before I bought the saddlebags. They came with two spacers, and my bike needed four to install them parallel to the wheel, and the seller promptly sent two more. Great communication!<br /><br />These turned out to be too small for full-size Saddleman bags, but some creative Velcro straps made them work anyway.
B001DCN1SC|4|Good product overall; saves you money.  Installed both supports in approximately 15 minutes (Honda Odyssey 2007). One of the units had bottom connector turned in opposite direction and required adjustment with pliers.
B004EIAADG|1|Bought this unit at Wal-Mart.  Lost the receipt and the box got throw away with the warranty card...both my fault.  Unit was charged to 98% when I got it home, but having read a lot of the reviews, I plugged it in for 3 days.  Used it one night to run my CPAP machine, it ran for about 5 hours and was at 82%.  It wouldn't charge any more than 82%, left plugged in for a couple of weeks.  Used it one day to run a small fan, ran it down to 17%.  Plugged it in, wouldn't charge above 17%.  I sent Schumacher customer service a message asking for help.  They said if I had the receipt I could take it back to Wal-Mart or if I had the warranty card, I could mail it back to them, but I would have to pay the postage.  I agree those policies are fair, with the exception I had to pay for postage,  but I wanted to know what was wrong with the unit.  They were no help there.  Threw it in the trash, won't waste my time with this brand again.
B001GMTL2Y|5|I was a bit skeptical when I saw all the other reviews talking about how strong and great these were...but I took a chance, and all those other reviews are RIGHT!!! These babies are FABULOUIS!!! TRULY heavy duty!!! Get them, you will not be sorry!!!
B001V8U12M|5|This, along with my cordless drill, make raising and lowering the trailer jacks a breeze.  I've even been told that &#34;I'm cheating&#34; by using this. I just respond saying that I'm not cheating, but rather working smart instead of hard!
B006STQILM|4|It arrived after about 8 days. I WOULD HAVE LIKED IT SOONER ... my car was misfiring.... but then I installed them and my jag S now works just great! I'm very pleased!<br /> I RECOMMEND THEM.
B000BPLNXC|5|It cleans snow, bam! done.  Overall, the brush is made of thick heavy duty plastic, this should last a long time.  Brush is angled forward compared to the handle which helps keeps hands dry.  I've bought two so far,  one for a relative, they love it, there is a difference between this and the stuff you find at typical retail stores.
B000H70OWK|5|I've been using the pyrometer for 3 months, the color changes are awesome and the readings are quite accurate. Great gauge to have! I just hope it lasts.. ;)
B00OTXT8IE|2|Very bright however they flicker and lights that flicker do not look good.
B002ZTI4XE|4|fits perfectly, there is no better mat ... TOTALLY OVERPRICED ... cmon a piece of plastic for 70$... insane ...
B003FCVTS2|1|After carefully following the owners.manual for installation I still could get the bulb to work. I am unsure if the AMP is correct but only one lamp works and these bulbs do not.
B007S0LDME|5|I used Happy Camper in my previous trailer and liked it very much. When we bought our new trailer the salesman gave us a bottle of blue liquid and recommended that we use it. I did not like the smell it left in the trailer so before it was even finished I ordered a new container of Happy Camper. I won't be changing again.
B001D6GYLO|5|The product was good, it works easily, stores well. priced well and it  arrived when it was promised. Should have ordered more.
B0049ELS54|5|Perfect. Thanks.
B0085FOXRI|5|This part only works on cars that are owned by Puerto Ricans. If you are not, don't waste your time.
B000YC8MVI|5|I've read the other comments, so I thought that I would add mine, and address a couple of the objections raised.<br /><br />First, the ordering process. The way that these are described hereon is confusing. I settled on what I ordered after a half hour spent trying to see if what I had was the same as what I was seeing. The descriptive terms and the titles both need to be revised.<br /><br />That said, these are great plate covers as long as you realize their limitations. First and foremost, you cannot rely on the cautions against using them with your car. I've been using the same type (the plastic, clear cover with gasket  ones) for many, many years, and when I searched to see if what they were selling here would work on my cars, the answer was &#34;No&#34;. However, when the plate covers arrived, they were the same as those what I had on my cars (only new), and fit without a problem. So, the fit/no fit decision is best lest up to the test when received, not to Weathertech.<br /><br />Second, securing the plate into the cover can be done several ways, but I think that mine remains the best. Hie yourself to Lowe's or The Home Depot and buy a few of their white toilet seat cover bumpers. They cost about a buck a piece, and come with their own securing screws. Toss the screws, use the short license plate bolts shipped with the covers, and screw them through the cover, the plate, and then into the bumper. The screw threads hold securely for as long as seven years (the longest that I've had a set so configured) and the connection is both secure and free from any hazard of scratching your paint work, since the screw does not protrude from the bumper. Problem solved. (And, the weight of the bumpers damps down any tendency on the part of the plate to rattle as well.)<br /><br />Third, when installing the covers, be ultra careful when tightening the bolts/screws. I use the torque limiter setting on my electric screw driver, using the configured tool to first drive the screws at the &#34;4&#34; setting. This tightens up the screws to when they hold, without cracking the plastic. Then, slowly and carefully tighten them up with a manual screwdriver to where they are snug, but not overstressed.<br /><br />Fourth, before assembling the plate covers, I always wax them front and back, and on a yearly basis, I repeat the process. This protects the plastic from the &#34;frosting&#34; tendencies that some plastics exhibit in our polluted air. The one sit that I did not take this precaution with was the one on my band trailer. This cover was usually kept in the garage, and spent very little time outside and exposed, but inside of a year, it frosted up. My others did not.<br /><br />Finally, do not accidentally push on the plate cover with your knee when lifting something out of the trunk. They will crack if subjected to this type  of pressure.<br /><br />All in all, a great product, if one with some limitations. In any event, far better than their poorly fitted trunk liners...s at the &#34;4&#34; setting. This tightens up the screws to when they hold, without cracking the plastic.

B0002BC06E|5|This 12v probe tester is a well constructed and heavy duty hand tool.  It is leaps and bounds better than anything I could find in any of 3 different auto parts stores in my area.  Extra long metal probe, and a very flexible ground cord make this product a winner.
B000M8U6RM|5|[[VIDEOID:mo2MUS2G2OO5OQG]]I was surprised to find out that the compressor's pressure gauge was very accurate.  I inflated 4 tires, stopped the compressor, and then checked the pressure using a different gauge.  The gauge I checked it against has been tested by a tire vendor and found to be very accurate.  In the case of my compressor if you stop it exactly where you want the pressure to be then that will be the correct (compressor off) pressure.  Let me restate this, hook up the compressor, run it to the pressure you want to achieve, then turn it off.  It's hard to make it more simple than that!  In the video you'll see that I inflated the tire to 36 psi.  I was still figuring I needed to inflate the tire past where I wanted it in order to compensate for the increased pressure while the pump was running.  This is not the case for my particular unit, I just stop it exactly where I want the pressure to be and it will be accurate.
B00FNJ8YKG|1|Sorry to say it but this thing is terribale
B0046VKRQ6|4|Looks fantastic on my 14 windows Bus, the quality is acceptable but for that price could be better, the assembly is easy and can end up with few tools
B005DSSEOI|1|I thought it was Anti-Theft, but these are just fancy screws. And they are not heavy duty at all.
B00CDAFT6K|4|I switched to these shades from the more expensive type of pull-down shades with the main goals of reducing the number of suction cups that never seem to work right and also to cover more of my window.  I drive a large SUV and a nice feature of these is the appearance and the ease of overlapping them to basically create a custom window shade.  Therefore I have 2 on each side window adjacent to my two kids' car seats.<br /><br />They work well, but if a manufacturer of these type of items would ever figure out a more robust suction cup, then it would be a gold mine.  I have clean windows and it seems I have to stick them back up every few days.  Overall I would definitely recommend these over the pull shade types, but they are not perfect either.
B003S1TK68|5|Added this one to my home alarm system.  This is a 2nd one for the house and they both work quite well in remotely setting alarm status.  This remote should be easy to install as long as you have the installer code and use the instructions provided with the wireless key.
B000JZB424|3|i've order this product twice.iwent by the custermor reveiw for the passenger side<br />wrongside both times.i'll keep it and put it on the driver side and order ball joints for the other side.costing me a lot wasteful time
B00585IO14|4|Too expensive!
B0035G38PU|1|I purchased this engine guard on July 13th, it didn't even ship till the 19th. This morning i received the black engine guard (July 24th). When i opened the box up all was inside was the black bar and a packet of screws. There was no protective wrapping on the bar and in the commute from Colorado to West Virginia the black bar rubbed against the cardboard and rubbed the paint clear off. I'm pretty bummed out about the whole situation.
B003LSJJJ6|5|Good quality for the price.
B001MV8INC|5|I am very happy with these mics.  They have exceeded my expectations. They work great at all sound levels.  Overall a smart addition to my mic collection.
B005OZNRVK|5|it good
B0024E5XOS|5|It worked just as I had hoped. Product was intact and in good working order. Thank You!
B000EDCC54|5|Arrived fairly quickly, installed w/o issue and work well. I also used some 3/8 spacers to maintain some ride height.
B0091Q3NCG|5|it works well,,good for the price...fast delivery
B008SEBQ2G|1|Fit properly however no reception. Does nothing for my radio. This item need to be removed from sales list
B00CFQQMM2|5|the compressor fit in the Jeep  look a glove, works great
B000COO474|5|Great buy thank you!
B000VBOTSM|5|I have a Suzuki SV65o and this fits perfectly, just like the other review said (with picture). The rubber sleves are a plus to protect your swing arm paint. This was the first time to use it and it was very easy to use. The package came pre-asembled. Only few bolts to do.    Very well recommended for motorcyclist out there. I looked out there for a similar product and they cost 2x or more.
B005N53C9I|5|It's fantastic! makes my car look better and I keep it clean more often than i did with my normal suede seats
B006BNTK1A|5|I purchased these as a small gift for my husband. I like to buy him little things here and there to remind him how special he is to me. He loved them! They look great and were a great price and arrived in half the time I expected them too!
B0013ERRSK|5|We bought this for travel, but our dog loves it so much that she won't drink out of her regular water bowl anymore.  Not sure what makes it so great for her, but for us its great because we can have water for her while we travel.
B00E975MPI|5|Excelente product,  this is my second order i would recomend it to anyone i used in my wheels and is just perfect
B000HBNX38|5|wow best product for treatment of rust any kind of rust. product does as is said to
B001Y93RKQ|5|Good quality hub caps.  U simply pop the steel ring into the plastic wheel covers and just snap them in place over your old steel wheels.  Align the tire valve stem with the U shaped groove in wheel cover and you're done.  My original toyota stock wheel covers started to decay and eventually one fell off while driving, so I bought these as replacement.  They look just as good and fit nicely.  I recommend them to other Toyota owners with 16&#34; steel rims.  The style looks similar to a stock Toyota cover which is what I was going for.
B001I0DCXI|4|Work better than the original
B005LW0NJU|4|looks okay buy 20 bucks over priced 30 bucks total local auto store has red and black for 10 bucks and quality isnt that good mine ripped twice when installing
B00E9LLLJK|1|The tabs around the  baskets don't match the holes in the 08 Tundra steel front bumper. I had a shop put these on but didn't tell me this. I found out when I adjusted the lights myself.  The baskets don't come lose, they are snug. It just bugs me that the holes don't match. 2 stars for the price.
B005SB6Q2W|1|order was prompt, but the tape is useless, it wouldn't stick to the awning. we cleaned the awning with rubbing alcohol dried it good and it wouldn't stick so to make sure the tape was crap, we tried to stick it to some glass and it wouldn't stick to that either. final comment is it's a rip off!!
B00080QHMM|5|I lost my first one and I am sure this one will be as good, with very fast shipping.
B00XVRV2OC|1|When I purchased the kit, the advertising from Orange Electronic was a 5 to 7 year lifespan on the sensors.  We fitted them to our vehicle, which is primarily used in city type driving; not many freeway miles.  We got maybe 2 years out of it before sensors started to fail, one at a time.<br /><br />Now, Orange says 3 years of sensor longevity.  Every set of tires I've bought lasted more than 3 years; de-mounting tires to change sensors is not what I thought I'd have to do when I purchased this kit.<br /><br />The overall concept seems sound, and while it worked, the display and information was spot-on.  However, this TPMS kit has some serious reliability issues.  We switched to the Schrader TPMS kit, but with only a year on these tires and sensors, we'll see how it stacks up.
B00EECM5FI|3|Bought a 2-pack of the 6000K bulbs and was only able to use one bulb.  These fit in one headlight but not the other.  I had to move the stock bulb over to the slot that burned out and place the Kensun bulb where the good one was.  Almost exact same color as stock (2008 VW GTI).  I can't tell when I'm driving that there's any difference, and its minimal when shining on a light colored garage door. Good brightness.  White/Bluish color.<br /><br />I won't buy again because I can only use them in one side of the car.<br /><br />The one bulb I did use is still going strong.  We'll see if it makes the 6-7yr life of the stock bulbs.
B005E4OPNU|5|Great
B0055PD1H4|3|Ok
B0085MEDJE|5|Nice fit
B006WQRWKM|4|i was worried that they were so low priced but product was solid and work good would buy again if i had too
B000BZADVK|5|Replaced both front end seals and haven't had any leaks so far. Viton rubber is the most resistant to heat. Great buy!!!
B000EDQR6E|5|ok
B001DKPZBK|1|So i ordered this and this part, it came in a nice packet but too bad didnt fit my prizm where as amazon said it will so becareful with the product
B00JJRGSQU|4|Kala!
B001B5X8DE|5|In years past, most cars had wheel well trim like this.  It's still a practical choice, as it protects the widest part of the truck from car doors.  I prefer the look as well.    Installation is pretty easy.  Putco provides both screws and pull strap retainers (I wish I could describe them better!)  The screws require drilling, and I did not use them for the initial installation, but will someday.  Note that if you drill, some grease or silicone in the hole may be a useful measure to prevent rusting.    The pull straps are very easy to use and have not shown any indication of loosening in over a year.  You will need pliers to fasten these.    Overall, these do the job and look better than the bare wheel well in my opinion.  Installation is not much of a chore.  Recommended.
B001UG8S8O|5|This was a wonderful purchase and great present! I bought two, and was pleasantly surprised at just how big the decal actually was.
B000WK3PQO|2|I picked this up direct from the manufacture a little over a year ago. And the first time that I needed to use the needle nose pliers, they failed. As I applied pressure to the handles they flexed and did not allow for proper torque transfer. Then upon inspection, the pliers would not close all they way again.  The adjustable wrench tool would clamp down on the item to be worked on...then spread when pressure was applied. It makes for a wonderful nut/bolt rounder-offer, but that's about it.    The rest of the pieces while of similar quality (mediocre) have all worked out much better.  The Essenti-Tool has proven more valuable, and the bits and bit holders are a nice touch.    If this is your last resort tool, I suppose that you could do worse. But in hind-site, I do wish that I had done more research on similar tools.
B003L643KS|5|Good conncetors if you have to safely quick change several electrical tools. Only disadvantage is that some tools have the positive pole so that this receptacle has the positiuve pole bare outside - risk of short. In tha case I cut out a little hole ion a plastic pill box and slip it over and fix it. So the connector with the bare plui pole is protected...
B00280CXAA|5|This product is bilge vent hose.  Not much more to say than that.  But the one thing I will caution, is that its 10' completely stretched out.  Which now that I think about it, is exactly what I should have expected, but I guess I was surprised.  Because even though I only really need to go about 10' in my boat, I will need about 20' of this hose to do that, with the bends and things.  Anyways, just wanted to let me people know that its 10' completely stretched out.  Its only about 1' completely collapsed.  My advice, order more!
B004VR0H1A|5|Super easy installation and they look great! 3 mounting brackets vice two on other brands, and they are not flimsy. I highly recommend this product.
B00N3VYMJ8|5|Made well. Comes with 2  rubber inserts to protect steering wheel.  Metal clamp is heavy duty. Knob is very comfortable to touch. You get what you pay for. Instructions are not in english. Simple to install. Installed on 2012 Mustang. Operates very smoothly and quite.
B0081TETU4|5|This is a cool one and my friend liked it a lot.  only thing we wished was if this remote had the usual 5 key button of which one will be dedicated for trunk door opener.
B009ZZZT02|5|They delivered really fast! I got it before the estimated delivery date. Very happy with the product. It took my husband less than 10 minutes to install. I would recommend this product.
B004BFSEK8|4|I received this in a timely manner. I wanted a hair scrub brush and was hopeing it wasone. After receiveing it--I found out it was not.  I can still use it on other things like claening engine parts. I wanted a hair scrub brush to was cars. If it was advertsed as a nylon brush. I would have probably passed on it. But I have it and will use it on other things
B000C5E4OQ|2|The white plastic tabs sheared off on installation as if they were made of nacho chips.<br /><br />The black ones were a little loose in my application, but this kit was not even supposed to work in my application.<br /><br />I had to thin out the receptacles in the headlight buckets for the slot on these (phillips head) screw heads.<br /><br />My old screws were seized in the plastic, or stripped the plastic. They were torx head but due to rust I thought they were phillips head and stripped the heads too.<br /> Nice to have adjustable headlights again
B001URVKS8|5|as described fast shipping
B00L2SK360|1|Very white from looking at them from the front, but can't even tell the headlamps are on because the light on a blacktop road is non-existent. You can kind of see the road if it's concrete, like a freeway. I'll be going back to a more yellowish bulb, these were a waste of money.
B000H92L4W|4|The connector works fine. Unfortunately you have to have the engine running for it to work. It's  just not what I needed to<br />replace a regular charger.
B001A6CQ5A|3|Make sure to be 100% on what size stem mirror your bike takes.  These are not &#34;universal&#34; out of the box like the seller describes.  I had to buy adapters off eBay to make these work on the stock mounts of my 01 F650GS.<br /><br />Fit aside--these are basic mirrors that work well.  They're fairly study but definitely get a bit &#34;vibey&#34; on the highway.
B00KXK0GNI|5|Fairly stiff, but made of good quality materials. It adds such style to my keychain and identifies me as the proud owner of a beautiful Mustang.
B008L59I7W|5|Great product, color matched perfectly, easy to install.
B00BJLWW9Q|5|does the job
B00CPY5VMQ|5|Good Value.
B00495UQT2|5|Installed in my small car to add to the orignal system works great and included everthing. would recomend for tight installs.
B0009VA7Q2|1|The cover did not fit and looked cheap . I felt I wanted it to look nice when it was on the car.
B007NQ3KRO|5|These mats fit perfectly and are exactly what I needed for the winter months ahead.
B00L7YCWAE|5|Nice product Thanks
B001KR3K36|5|Easy install. I'll probably buy these again when I need to.
B000IE0EZO|5|First off I have not actually used this and hope I never have to. However I can talk about what I think about it. I was going to order the regular hammer version but my dad was telling me underwater you might not have the momentum to swing it enough to break the glass so you want a mechanism that will do the work for you. I tried this upon receiving it and it packs quite a punch (i let it strike the air as i don't want to dull it) the piece on the end is a little bit difficult to get off but maybe that would change after doing it so many times. Very small and seems well built even comes with a keyring but i just put mine in the middle box (for convience of both passengers if needed) or order 2 and place one on each side of the car or one in front and back.
B000IYBEOE|5|For replacement parts ngk is highly reliable, and i was not let down.  I have a 99 Civic Si and the fitment for the cables was perfect. I paired it with the laser platinum spark plugs (from NGK) and i am getting almost 2 more mpg now after replacing them together. My car idles perfectly and sounds like brand new, i will update after a year or so to see how they hold up.  Worth the money to take care of your engine. They are also $20 cheaper on amazon than anywhere else, autozone wanted $70 for the same wires.
B00JH0KEXW|5|I use this stuff on almost every bolt I take off my truck. Makes it a lot easier the next time around, and protects the bolt from corrosion.
B005FSPJFI|4|I love fleur de lis' and when I saw this I had to buy it. I started to put it on as soon as I opened the package and unfortunately it took me about 15 minutes with the help from a friend to get it on. When I finally did I realized that it was crooked but I have yet to take it off and try to put it on. However, it is very cushioned and feels great.
B00MWCLYRM|5|This is a high quality sticker, and it went on my car easily. It has stayed with no problems, no cracking, and no lifting.<br /><br />I highly recommend!
B0051D3MP6|5|It works as designed. Not too much more to say beyond that. I do like that it doesn't overcharge the battery, but I would imagine that's a standard feature of all battery tenders. Wouldn't hesitate to buy another if I need one for a different vehicle.<br /><br />I used this to keep my motorcycle battery charged over the winter.
B0024NSLO8|5|I got these lights to replace the ones in my 2000 Camry because the old ones were so faded & discolored. They worked great & were easy to install, now I can see well at night again!
B0049MX7V4|5|Great product !!  Start to finish installed in ten minutes with no special tools. Would recommend to anyone in need of a reciever hitch.  I'm hauling my bike rack everywhere!
B00838SXNW|5|Too bad it doesn't fit my car so I gave it away as a gift...but it's a beautiful product.
B004HZ02MK|5|Well built
B004TC1C3E|1|Were problem with electric plug, in connector was broken one contact.
B002SIR91A|3|Great shovel, but I wish they designed it better or included some sort of storage. A cheap back or something, or maybe the dissembled handle locks onto the blade (or at least fits against the blade).  I really don't want it rattling around the back of my SUV.
B0002MAB8M|1|Spend the extra $5 or $10 and get the better one.  First thing that happened was the ratcheting system give and that was only after the first day.
B004MDT8MW|5|Install was easy, works as designed. Logging is no problem with Romraider and Logworks.  Long pig tail harnesses on the gauge pods could be a problem for some people to tuck away.
B00GBP9AL8|4|Works ok, but material is thinner than what they used to use and after three adjustments I'm almost out of thread on the adjustment screws. If the material was better (same as what they were using just two years ago) I would have given five.
B0009IQZH0|4|BF loves this stuff
B007ZDDUCK|4|I use this to condition everything from shoes to briefcase, to belts, keychains, bracelets etc.  It smells really good and softens the leather while cleaning it at the same time.
B000AMXSWK|4|They are good bulbs, seem to last a long time the only reason I deducted a star is because they really are not a cool blue or even a bright white. They look just like any other bulb. They work though.
B00TEF4ZZI|5|These decals are very high quality and easy to place.
B001DRLQN4|4|You can get this or pay $70 at your local Stealer (Dealer).  Be sure to set your ventilation system to Recirculate.  DO NOT force the vent door down (in the glove box), I've read that people have broken this door and had to pay hundreds of dollars to fix.  Repeat, DO NOT force it, read the car's manual for instructions on how to replace.  When you set the system to recirculate, you will see the door drop down on its own exposing the filter cartridge housing.
B004I0KCVA|5|Perfect fit 2005 f-150 STX 4x4.  Great price.
B0012WHBSO|5|Item works great! Have used it a dozen times so far on my cars and those of family and friends.  As its filling the gauge isnt always accurate, so i would recommend a separate air pressure gauge to double check psi.  Its small so common sense tells you it wont inflate a tire in 10 seconds but its not absurdly slow either.  Otherwise, exactly as advertised with excellent compact neat carrying case.
B00BYF8KO8|5|It was a perfect fit
B007JSGR9Y|5|For the price you can't beat this code reader. It is inexpensive, but gives you accurate descriptions and is a great value.<br /><br />I have used other more expensive readers but for the average car owner all you want is the basic information that this reader provides.<br /><br />I would reccomend this anyone who does not want to visit a shop to see what is wrong with your vehicle.
B0036PUHN6|5|Replaced my 12 volt power winch with this manual 2 speed winch. Had many problems with a 2,000 Lb power winch not having enough power to pull up my 19' Hurricane boat. Placed this Fulton F2 2 speed manual winch, and love it. Was very easy to load our boat. Placed it in high speed for the wife to connect, and first retrieve, plan was I would get out of boat and finish as we had always done. She said, \\"this is so easy, I don't need you to take over.\\" She never even had to place in low gear, although I showed her again how to change, and she said next time she would give it a try.<br />Love this choice. And power to my decision, the wife is so happy it matches the boat as we have a White boat with black wide stripe. I was not even aware this was a requirement for a winch :)
B001EOWRO8|5|Best price I could find online. Fit perfectly onto my 2003 Chevy 2500HD Long Box. It doesn't say in the directions, but you will need to unbolt your entire box and jack it up about an inch and a half for clearance to slide the rails across the frame. The box is only held down by 8 bolts (18MM I think) so isn't a big deal, (4 in front and 4 in back) just takes a little more time. You will also need a long extension and a wobbly. You will need to either remove the heat shield from the section between the two bed rails or cut it out. I cut mine out with a reciprocating saw with out taking it off because the little T25 torques head screws were rusted out. It was fast and easy. You should not need to disconnect any wires or fuel lines for this install, there aren't any near the rail install or hitch install. The rails are 1/2\\" angle iron, pretty heavy duty. From start to finish this took me almost five hours to complete, that includes walking back and forth between my shops finding the tools I needed and bolting the bed back on. I installed this with Curt 61052, both are of good quality and work great. This kit comes with the brackets for a Chevy 1500 and 2500/3500 frame 1999 to 2007. It comes with a bracket for the 2007 to move the fuel evaporator or something. You will need a 1 1/8\\" wrench and or socket to install the two large bolts and a torque wrench to 380 foot pounds or some M-A-N. I used the latter. You will also need a 3/4 deep well socket or wrench for the u-bolts and a 15/16\\" deep well or wrench for the cross rails. This kit fit right up to the bed frame rail and I did not have to cut any section of the bed frame rail. The rear frame rail will not line up exactly center with the brackets as it shows in the instructions, but that's ok it's only going to be forward maybe a 1/4\\" from center. Your ball hitch will end up 2\\" in front of the axle which is just fine. Just make sure your u-bolts on the brackets are tight and touching to the frame and as far forward asthey can go. You will know what I mean when you are putting it together. Over all an easy install with no drilling required in the frame or moving of electrical, brake, or fuel lines. You will drill your 6 pilot holes from underneath the bed through the rails to line up the hitch template from up top with plenty of clearance for a drill.
B00CHDB5RK|5|Great part. Easy to install
B003NI1H6W|5|I was able to find the correct star head ratchet at Home Depot. The new struts were very easy to install, especially with another person to hold the liftgate for a few seconds. After a couple of inital openings to lossen up, the struts work perfect.
B005TCCKTS|2|Had to make modifications just to make this thing fit.  It feels very cheap, and I don't trust it.
B00IHZ0FNC|5|Good fit, actually fit back in pouch when put away.
B0017L9BTW|5|This exhaust was an easy install after getting off  the stock exhaust. Only problem I had was breaking the front clamp than finding out its a dealer only 35.00 part, and waiting a week for it. Nice sound with cold air intake, not objectional on highway.
B00301CF18|5|Excellent ballast. Easy to install. Comes with everything you need. Doesn't hum. Recommended to anyone who needs to install HIDs or needs a replacement ballast.
B000HAEPAO|5|I added these my trailer so I have for anchor points to attach my load too which way is about a total of a thousand pounds and they're working wonderfully
B007VYBRFA|5|Works really good
B000066OC8|1|The on light flickered and I couldn't get it to work at all.  A friend tried it and had the same experience.  Very disappointing.
B006NOFKMU|5|Does the job required and was delivered on time.
B0055FLTPU|5|Easy install. Headlight location on truck was the worse part. If light was in a better location it would have beena 10 minute install but very easy and great product
B000C9IJBQ|1|Don't buy it. Started squicking within one week of installing. The only good thing about it is that now I am an expert at replacing water pumps on Ford Tauruses.
B00APU34VW|5|I purchased these All-Season Mats for my 2013 Accord Sport Sedan.  They Fit PERFECTLY.  I love the embossed ACCORD logo as well.  The Driver's mat even has the correct notches to fit in the little gromets.  Very satisified with this purchase and I know these will be easier to care for then carpeted ones. Just take out, hose or rinse off and dry then put back.
B00ENOPX74|3|Fits and functions fine. I wish it had come with screws and instructions.
B00669VIB4|5|Very well made ......fit well with very little modifying....Not overly loud comes complete with hardware and gaskets looks awesome in place
B0007WXJDG|5|I was new to tent camping (pop up) and didn't know that the caster wheel was removable from the jack.  It stayed on all camping season until the last trip.  Arrived back home and it was gone.  I searched online forever before I confirmed this was the right size for my Atwood jack. The wheel is a perfect replacement for our Atwood trailer tongue jack. It's now so easy to move the trailer around at the camp site, driveway, and in the garage.<br /><br />Beware Atwood has two sizes, depending on your jack. Measure to be sure:<br />Atwood 80259 Caster - 1-3/4\\" inner diameter tube with 1-7/8\\" outer diameter<br /><br />Atwood 80552 Caster - 2\\" inner diameter tube<br /><br />Support pad and 2\\" wide plastic \\"Twist Lock\\" wheel casters for tongue jacks. 1,000 lb. rating, remove before towing! One caster wheel only. The product came on time and without any issues.
B000ANOUHQ|3|This product works great.... but it will run your battery flat in 3 hours if you don't unplug it...It happen to me..I rather ride on a cold seat then to have a dead batttery after a hard days work
B00498D6QO|5|These clamps are slightly different than pictured.  There are three pairs of spring washers, not just one pair like in the image.  This is because these are the 'heavy duty' version.  They are all stainless steel.  I started using them on the radiator hoses on my race truck; then don't vibrate off, never leak, and don't feel like they are going to strip when you tighten them.  They provide a very even clamping pressure without smashing the hose. They worked so well that I now use them on all my daily drivers. They cost a few bucks more but it's one less thing I have to worry about.  One thing to watch out for is fitment; the drive section is fairly large, and they may not fit in really tight spots.
B0077RYR62|4|Well depicted characters. Went on easily enough. Same problem with most stickers; bubbles. Once the sticker is on its impossible to get the bubbles out. Though, With the clear back ground, It's almost impossible to see any imperfections at a distance.
B00DCCMUOC|5|&#34;Check Engine&#34; light was on and repair shop wanted $284 total to replace the transmission output sensor. I am not anywhere near being a mechanic, but I watched 2 u-tube videos on how to change the sensor and I bought both the &#34;input&#34; and the &#34;output&#34; sensors on Amazon and changed them and saved myself over $200. It took me about an hour but I spent some time cleaning the air filter and dust/dirt on the engine and parts. Sensors came from Detroit in genuine Hyundai boxes and markings on the sensors.
B007O5GXWS|5|Very pleased with this controller and with the pigtail to plug in to the trucks OEM wiring harness it was very easy.
B002XLBMZQ|5|This is a great hitch, I've owned one for at least 15 years, this one replaced one that saved my truck. I was rear ended by a car going about 50 mph while stopped at a traffic light ,the hitch took most of the damage. Did I mention that I use this hitch to haul all my trailers around, Boat, Travel, Equipment, and Car and it works great.
B00D60YJP8|5|nice,brighter than my headlight,Philippines
B00JRR77Q2|5|Makes my Subaru BRZ look even better !
B009DK3OVA|5|It took about a day of driving after I installed the sensor for the check engine light to turn off. But it worked
B002ON0B46|3|The emblem is well made and correctly captures the Alabama logo, but the red background is faded and washed out. The red is not the Alabama red crimson I was expecting. So, I didn't put it on my car. Dissappointed.
B002YK7W3C|5|fast delivery, great tool for the price. this is the tool for you if your new to using lab scopes.
B003YCMQCG|5|Good
B00278MDFS|5|It is OEM, reasonably priced, and an exact fit.  I'm not sure what else to say other than ONAN makes great parts.
B00BY2220O|4|This stool is as expected. Do not mistreat it as it is household quality not commercial. If you get a defective unit then replace it. I imagine the QA is not so good. It is constructed of 8 pieces injected molded plastic with snap together joints. It is rated at 300 pounds but I would not go over 200. I take off one star for value as it is slightly overpriced.  That said, most families will find it works for most applications.
B00IX5MOD0|1|I bought these projection lights for my range rover and when I installed them they looked great I loved them but within a week you could barely make out what it said and 2 weeks later is was just a smudge on the ground so don't waste your money just when u realize there junk it's to late to return ..
B0040CYWX0|5|they worked just right
B00JFKUG4Q|5|Excellent product! Arrives very quickly and the plates looks great.
B008HSLTE8|4|The first one I received did not work. I contacted customer support who were quite helpful and sent me a replacement one guaranteed to work (which it did). However, I had to spend more money to send the original remote back. I would have given this product 5 stars if I had been reimbursed for the cost to return the non-functioning remote.
B000FTRAWM|4|as described.
B000630B1Y|5|Very good product. I will buy another soon.
B000A7BMKK|5|Ramp works great! I use it to load a GSXR 1000 and CBR 600 into a Dodge Dakota. Would suggest one a little longer if your bike is lowered.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Awesome. Bought a wiring harness with relay and fuse to go with it. Bright and inexpensive
B00061NQVS|5|This clean does a great job of cleaning the cloth seats in my Tan 2011 Tahoe.  These seats stain very easily and are very difficult to clean.  This product does the best job of anything else I've tried.  The carpet comes out perect as well.  I highly recommend this cleaner.
B001NI7KE2|5|Love it! I finally found one that isn't half plastic and breaks under the cold and weight.
B00HEBT3ME|1|The mounting bracket is in the wrong place , which when bolted makes the hose interfere with the drive belt! Another review on the amazon web site also said the same? I should have believed it. Hope Dorman gets the message. The hose at the other end of the water pump is excellent.
B003CK251W|4|I wasn't really happy with the all balls steering bearing kit, but this seemed really good.  Only time will tell if it's as good as OEM but installed perfect and seemed of high quality.
B0002SPBQI|5|When I heard about this \\"miracle towel,\\" I thought yea right. All I need is water and this piece of cloth and I can wash my whole car without soap and I do not have to rinse or dry it and it'll look great. YEA RIGHT!!! I didnt believe it. However, my dad, who restores old cars to mint condition, told me about how well it works for him. I thought to myself if he likes this product, it must be good because he only uses the best on his cars. He took me out to his garage and showed me and I was amazed how eazy it worked. He knew I would like it because I'm kind of lazy when it comes to cleaning things. The cloth works very well. All you do is soak the cloth with water and ring it out until it is barely wet and wip your vehicle down. It helps if you switch sides every now and then for some reason. Once the cloth gets dirty, rinse it out again and repeat the process. I usually can do the whole side of my car before I have to rinse it out. It just depends on how dirty my car is. Also since the cloth isnt very wet, while you are washing your vehicle, you dont have to dry your car afterwards and there are no water spots. The windows streak a little though but all I do is get a regular dry towel or shamie and dry up the small amount of water left on the windows. I wash my whole car with the towel except my tires. My tires get very greasy due to the brake fluid or whatever that grease is. I probably could use the cloth for my tires also however I want the cloth to last somewhat a long time and choose to wash my tires the old way. The towels can be repeatedly used. All you do is hand wash them with a \\"little\\" detergent or machine wash them. My dad tells me that if I use too much detergent the chemicals may wear out the cloth faster. I dont know if thats true however he's the expert compared to me so I only use a little. So my dad who is picky about his show cars likes it and I who is very lazy and knows nothing about cars likes it so what more proof do you need? I can wash my car in 25 percent of the time I use to wash it. Hey that makes it worth it to me.
B00HZW35OY|5|Absolutely enhanced the feeling of my Juke. Turn in is very responsive, and I can't wait to try it out in the snow.
B007WUSKJE|5|Good for price.
B006XKMPO0|5|Nice product. Descrete, does what is supposed to do, prevents door damage when opening the car doors in a parking lot with little space.
B001N4QY66|5|I love this item and my friends love it to, at least 3 have ordered their own, we use them for monitoring the speed of our mills and have found they are more accurate than the speed control on the mill.
B00843V6KI|5|my husband just started riding again and he is 70 years young and this works great for him it adds a lot of protection for him , , the always get it to you on time , great service<br />  thank you
B003CJELF6|5|Nice replacement for OEM lever.
B001DN1L6K|5|No problems
B005Z88WZ2|5|Awesome! This sticking is huge.
B004I12G68|5|i got into a wreck and it knocked my drivers side headlight out and this looks amazing! matches my passenger side great! Easy to install!
B005J43I56|5|I recently bought the mount for my 2004 Honda Shadow 1100. I simply removed one bolt from the handlebar mount and screwed the ram ball to replace the bolt. The install was very easy and I was very please with the position of the mount on my first ride.
B005H53J5G|1|These are junk! They looked used and only lasted one week and I only drove at night two out of the seven days! If I could take 5 stars away I would.. Don't waste your money, everything about these says cheap even the way they throw it all in the box...your a fool to buys these but you have been warned.
B004W972L0|4|Lights are awesome a little on the expensive side but thats just the way it always seems.  Quick shipping. Pull tape from back and set in warm dry place for a day or two to prevent \\"moisture spots\\" inside
B000BR6WA4|5|Husband LOVES IT! We've been struggling with 5th gear (high lift and big tires) on our 2004 Jeep Wrangler X. This K&N Air Intake system has really added quite a bit of horsepower to our toy! Big improvement with acceleration, higher speeds and lower RPM's = better gas mileage. Great product!
B002RDGMNM|5|The set appears to be of a good quality with a large variety of adapters and the ability to go left or right hand threaded when pressing in brake pistons.
B004SHDK08|5|Fits non Flexfuel.
B002XG21QK|5|Love this
B00FATTT1W|1|This is my 2nd one.  The first fell off in less than two weeks.  The company replaced it with a new one.  The new one fell off in less than a month.  A very poor product.  I'm not even going to return it for a replacement...not worth the trouble.
B000E39SZG|2|These floormats are very pretty but the \\"nibbed\\" backing is definitely NOT non-skid. The floor of my car is already carpeted, and these floormats slide around like crazy, needing to be readjusted almost every time I get in the car.
B009DJVD64|4|Fits just right on my SUV. Would buy again if need to.
B003628HFO|4|Received this motor swiftly. Installed in vehicle easiiy. Works like a charm. Just what I needed. No more noisy fan motor
B005446EVQ|4|Great stuff, but there were no sprayers included with the order.
B00NC8CRGC|5|This is a great looking, sturdy license plate frame.  Very nice looking finish, almost black mirror like.<br />The frame has 2 tabs on the bottom to keep the license plate in place, after installed it feels very sturdy and there is no rattling.  Rest assured that the car wash isn't going to bend your license plate with this frame installed.  The finish in the back has some minor imperfections but they will never be seen once installed.  Overall, I am very pleased with the product.
B008T4YOSS|4|I have to wear proscription glasses all the time. With the modular design, I can put it on with it taking off my glasses. Vents are all ready to manage, the flip down sun visor is awesome.
B0013TM0Z0|4|you can not compare this to an A-C heater , but as 12v heaters go for this price , I found this to be good one.
B00553VJGQ|5|I know I have bought four sets. What great about them is their narrow and long giving a wider view and not looking so ugly they are also adjustable .
B0097LLX7C|5|Really love this plate frame on my Corvette--It gets a lot of laughs on the road. Great quality. Worth the money
B005H5Z4NQ|5|The helmet is lighter than my HJC helmet was, the bluetooth worked perfectly and the sound wasn't at all bad.  Definitely a lot quiter than my previous helmet.  I actually purchased 2 of these for me and the wife to take a bike trip next weekend and the bluetooth can communicate between helmets<br /><br />Pros<br />lightweight<br />bluetooth works<br />it felt like it was made with Quality in mind<br /><br />Cons<br />Lack of available visors - I looked everywhere and couldn't find a smoke/dark smoke so ended up buying a mirrored one<br />not able to skip song using bluetooth
B00ANNWE1C|5|Perfect replacement.
B0043WKESE|5|Great Parts!!!!<br />I couldn't be happier.<br />Thanks!!
B000CC4O58|5|No frills. Works great.
B002RSIK4G|4|This was easy to install and seems to have good adhesion. I'll know more in a year.<br />I was doing a long run and found a helper was needed due to wind.
B007H2Q07G|5|This is so comfortable.  I bought a chaise pad for it and that is amazing!
B000C2AL5A|5|I had my mechanic install this gasket with no issues. Thought it is not as thick as the Toyota part, it did the job. Have a 1986 Toyota 4WD SR5 truck, so if that is what you have, it should be no problem.
B000RBILHQ|3|Exactly as described, but not equivalent to the previous massage cushion that I needed to replace.
B00496Z394|5|Fuel pump went out. Found this one on line. Was a little skeptical because so cheap but it arrived fast and i have had no problems with my car. Very happy.
B003SJEJE8|2|I picked this up at Costco to use in my surveillance van for powering a fan and to charge equipment.  It did the job for a while, then the inverter failed first with the USB then the AC plug.  Only the DC plug works now.  It appears about 6 months of Costco pushing the 350, it was discontinued.<br /><br />This is a unit that I use to help keep me alive in sweltering heat and it's basically failed.  Looking for new options now.
B000VAVDN2|5|As a former big fan of Fram,  AC Delco, and Wixx; I've moved on to Purolator.  I read an article on OEM parts manufacturers in Popular Mechanics - Purolator manufactures most filters for OEM replacement parts and brands them with the manufacturers name and branding.  I thought to myself, hmm... well if the manufacturer uses them so will I.  I'm impressed with the overall production/quality of Purolator products, they  weight and composition of materials seem far better when compared to  the aforementioned makers (excluding Wixx, their parts seem comparable, but usually are higher-priced).  Coincidently the article mentioned Gates as the preferred belt maker for engines made by the manufacturers, and Alpine for sound equipment/systems.  Please note that cabin filters, this one included seem almost a scam compared to crankcase air filters, as the cabin air filters are far slower air movement and relatively clean compartments.  I strongly urge you to compare the oil filters also, the Fram feels like it's an empty can versus the Purolator, it's my humble opinion to stick with suppliers for the manufacturers, as you get the same product, minus the mark-up.
B00I3E2BWK|5|Awsome!
B000C9GJ2C|5|Worked, cheaper than I could get anywhere else.
B00J0IKPIU|5|Easy to install on 2014 JK Wrangler. Works great!!
B0007TV6M0|5|I needed an easy-to-use wax that I could use every time I washed the car, and which wouldn't require a lot of extra time. Since I already dry the car by hand, this spray-on wax seemed like a great idea.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased. It does what it says, and smells great too. It's a far cry from a Klasse AIO and SG treatment, but that requires too much time for my schedule. I find that using this spray-on wax only adds perhaps 5 minutes total each time I wash the car. I do a quick towel dry to get the bulk of the water off, then spray this onto each area as I dry it the rest of the way.<br /><br />When using this, you'll want at least 3 good-quality towels. Use one to get the bulk of the water off, then another to do the bulk of the wax & dry, then a final one to get off any excess wax residue. Keep the towels clean by washing them between every car wash.<br /><br />The attached picture shows the roof of the car after about 2 weeks from the last wash and wax. Water is still beading nicely, and bird droppings come off easy.
B00BITL8KI|4|It does fir the air box and is cheaper than the OEM filter.
B0093HTPK2|4|I bought these for my son, fit is great quality is very good, I would recommend these for anyone wanting good quality at a reasonable price.
B00166LS1W|5|This is immensely handy. It plugs into a standard household electric plug, but you can plug a charger or power cord into it that was originally intended for use in a car lighter. It's inexpensive, and saves you the added expense of buying a separate power or charging unit for use in the house. It thereby reduces the amount of junk you have to keep track of to keep all those electronic gizmos either charged up or running, like cell phones, GPS, CD players, kindles, and all the other portable devices we have become so attached to.
B00080QGYG|5|works great
B001KQA6QG|5|This is for rear?????
B000SHXDWW|5|Get the full 1-1/2&#34; lift that I needed.
B002J858HQ|1|Docent smell good at all
B001UG4WIO|5|My son came home from school and this is the first thing he noticed. The decals stay on well through car washes etc, and my kids finally think I'm cool.
B001T4SNQO|5|The best investment I've made in a long time. I love this Jack AUX. It's simple to use and now I don't have to depend on a cheap AM/FM transmitter anymore. Now I can listen to my tunes from my ipod on long drives out of the city, even out of the state.
B004BASJZI|5|bought this as a gift for a friend, he loves it. easy to put on and great feeling to the touch
B001BELZ5S|5|I installed this on my 1995 4Runner. Quick, easy, straight forward. Only have to drill one hole on each side and everything else is plug and play. A no brainer for anyone who plans to haul any sizable load.
B003WGPIIS|4|This saved me about $350, since the dealer wanted to charge $400 for this part.  Thank you Amazon!  The part is made in China, so I don't know if it's really a Toyota part, but it seems pretty much identical to the original.  The only frustration is that it didn't come with screws, so we had to get some from the hardware store.  Luckily, the part we removed had one screw left, so we could match it.  The bigger question is what happened to Toyota quality control that this part would need to be replaced in a car with 50K miles on it in the first place, but that's another matter.  I'm just truly thankful that Switch Doctor sells on Amazon and I could save the money, since the dealer price seems insanely expensive.
B008AN4UDM|5|Dad will be happy come Christmas!<br />Exactly what was needed and received promptly! My only desire was maybe some paper work with specs in the package.
B00MCIKOOU|3|Guess you get what you pay for sometimes...The product is shown with a sturdy safety hook inside a spliced thimble. What you get is a winch rope with a spliced thimble. No hook included. Really should give it a 2 star. I will go by Home Depot and get a SS Quick Link for the thimble. I plan on using this as an emergency boat tow rope and purchased this one because of the completed set up. Not worth paying postage to return and replace.<br />YOU WILL NOT GET WHAT THE PICTURE SHOWS.
B000A8JNF0|5|There are lots of convertible top cleaners/protectors out there, and some from very good providers, but this is the one to use if you really care about your car. My convertible is eight years old, a black fabric top ... in sun blistering Florida. My car is parked outside during the day, targeted by gulls, and run through abrasive commercial car washes. Quarterly, and easily applied treatment with 303, and the top looks great. The top repels rain and holds it's color. There may be other products that work, but this came recommended from a lot of collector car forums. It just works!
B000HI0Q04|3|good
B00029JYS8|2|i chose this tach mainly for it's size and the fine history of Sunpro. I needed a small tach because I planned on installing it on the steering column of my 1970 Mach 1 Mustang and I needed it small enough not to occlude the vison of the speedo and dash gauges. It installed nicely but the tach does not read out accurately and it hangs intermittantly at 4000 rpm sometimes and then falls back when the moter is shut off. I really don't know what the rpm of the engine is as it seem to read about 200-300 rpm lower than the actual rpm.
B003E5P7EW|5|I put 4 of these on my full size lifted bronco amd For the $$ it doesn't get any better than this.
B004NV4G70|5|Perfect fit for my yamaha radian. They came within a week of ordering.
B00LSELQQ4|1|Stickers are poor quality.  I feel like I was ripped off!
B001G780OE|1|The PACKING SLIP stated that this was a WHEEL HUB...Now I have to wait for it to be returned so that the correct item can be shipped and this holds up my car repair...this product IS ERRONEOUSLY LISTED AS A WHEEL HUB ASSEMBLY & that is why this has happened...This is 2 MONTHS that I am ordering parts only to get incorrect parts which must be returned...AMAZON NEEDS TO CORRECT THESE PROBLEMS.  I HOPE SOMEONE REVIEWS THESE ERRORS AND MAKES THE CORRECTIONS RIGHT AFTER THEY HAPPEN.

B004C6M5BU|5|Throw a harley medallion on it and they will never no, good. Quality
B0074D8PFI|2|The car cover fit my 2011 Panamera but it would not stay secured to the car properly, in the slightest bit of wind the cover would flat in the wind and come off. If it wasn't for the safety straps that you close into the car door I would have been chasing my cover down the road. After numerous times of going outside to secure the cover back onto the car, I eventually just took the cover off.<br />It was not worth the $300 plus dollars I paid for it.<br />If you just want to use it to possibly protect it from the snow and then take it off after the storm it should do the trick.
B000HWU768|5|Was exactly what I expected. Good quality at a good price.
B000C7ZT3E|5|I replace original unit and work well.<br />My Jeep are from 1976 and keep oil presure indicators. good price. same as original
B0002SR88C|5|longer and sturdier than the folders, great for windshield stickers.<br />works great, holds spare blades in the handle.  Gets the job done.
B002308E9O|5|the tool worked great for the price I paid. it saved me around 100 dollars in repairs., because I would of had to take it to a guy that works on bikes. who would not let me use his tool. what a prick.
B004IARG5A|5|Glad we got it, sounds good, added a little but of noticeable power.  Haven't seen any fuel mileage increase though; I was somewhat disappointed in that.<br /><br />Update:  It's been a few months with the airaid...no gain in fuel mileage really.  The sound isn't bad, but sometimes it does get loud when you romp on it.d  The kids love the sound though.
B001TXWNLQ|5|It works great!
B001ADBV18|4|I bought this for my 2013 Tundra. Very easy to install (no longer than 5-10 minutes). The divides can be a little stronger, but over all, it is a great under-seat storage with more room than the OEM ones.
B000C16XO4|5|Well known and common problem with GM sedans that the power window motor burns out.   I previously purchased a cheaper regulator/motor from different vendor for the passenger side window. Brand new it would struggle to raise the windows. The Dorman product I purchased for the drivers side was far superior in construction and operation. The window now works better than factory original.  One word of caution. In their infinite wisdom, GM decide to use rivets instead of bolts to attach the regulator to the door. You have to drill or cut the rivets somehow to get the old unit out of the car. I used small bolts to install the replacement. Another tip, use a short piece of bent coat hanger to hold the window fully up while you replace the unit.
B00BH0KJGW|5|They look so good!  The secret is to put the locking pin in a twist BEFORE you try to put the cap on. Otherwise you're going to be frustrated.  They're great though and they are definitely not going anywhere!
B003VAYRNM|5|This is the exact part I needed for my RV and it is an exact replacement.  I'm big on going back with the right part, no subs.
B00CUREA5C|5|This product is as great as advertised! I bought it for my real long, thick hair after I get out of the shower and after 5 minutes my hair is almost dry,  with all other towels I have tried they leave my hair dripping wet and this one my hair does not tangle when I twist the towel to keep it wrapped around my hair, the size of this towel also make it easy to wrap my hair in, it leaves my hair easy to comb  and I don't have to use a blow dryer! I would recommend this towel to anyone, it truly does what it says!
B000CO9U3C|5|This is the best thing I've done to my truck yet. Improved throttle response and even a sounds better.
B0089LSP2M|5|prefect fix  no problems at all,
B0000AYEWJ|5|So far so good - was looking for something to get the thieves to move on the next boat and stay away from mine - I don't know what type of tool it would take to get this off without the lock but it would not be easy.  Also bought the MCGard 74036 Outboard Motor Lock Set to go with it also.  So far so good - don't know how a thief would ever get the prop off my boat without the key.
B001P2A0QQ|4|bought these for my dad 04 pathfinder and they fit just right, the only thing we had issue with was no splash guard like the stock ones, his were replaced due to the fact his stock ones rusted through.
B00B0Z16O8|5|This fits perfect for 2005 Dodge Durango Limited. My vehicle has a tan/beige interior and this is a gray/dark grey part. But, I don't care about stuff like that. I couldn't find the tan one anywhere online and I didn't want to order through the dealer. This part came from dealer stock, however.<br /><br />For anyone that attempts to replace this part on their own, leave the white plastic clip that connects the metal rod to the lever in place and connect the rod to the lever with the clip attached to the lever. Do not put the clip on the rod, then try to shove it through the hole on the lever.<br /><br />As far as the screws go, they mount the bracket directly into the metal supporting the dash. Using a #2 phillips head could, and mostly will strip the screw heads. Use a 9/32 socket for a less frustrating experience.
B008X12VIM|4|It fits the cbr 250, but it does not extend further out than the handle bars.  It will save your frame and crank case but handlebars will be damaged in a spill.
B000C9Y14A|4|Works as well as my motorcraft filter did....No real difference noted in engine response/performance.  Descent for price.  Works like it should
B00BEB3KX8|5|Great quality and look. Highly recommended!
B00E3SUULO|5|Looks awesome and was a breeze to install
B009DK6CD2|5|I ordered this for my Eclipse because it didn't have one installed when I bought it.. I then<br />Ordered the part from This Seller and It came Quickly, and I was surprised to see that it<br />included everything .. even the light.. I literally just walked out to my car and plugged in<br />the little quick disconnect &#34;Plug&#34; and it just snapped into place and worked perfect !!<br />anyone this is a very simple DIY job for yourself.  I recommend this item.
B00BFE1O6Y|5|Cost was half of what the dealer wanted.  Took five minutes to swap out.  Worked great.
B004GDIIBA|3|The material flexes a bit more than I'd prefer, but it fit right and is still holding out just fine.
B002BU36JE|5|good deal
B004SJUFH2|5|Perfect fit!! Not too flashy
B002FOO8HU|5|These worked great as an OEM replacement in our 2011 Nissan Altima with the 2.5L engine. Make sure you get a thin wall socket to go with these such as (SP1412 14mm, 12-Point Thin Walled Spark Plug socket.) Factory manual states no gap adjustment required, just install them. Also, don't forget some anti-seize compound as well so you can easily service them again down the road.
B001CEG90I|3|I bought this cabin air filter because my car was starting to have a musty smell with air conditioning on. The filter was easy to replace on my 2012 corolla, but at first i didn't notice a change in the musty smell after the filter was installed. I soon realized that the problem was due to my own fault of turning the car off while the air conditioning was on and in re-circulating mode. Now the car doesn't have that musty smell. Overall, I feel ok with my purchase but next time I will buy a regular filter since there is not a big noticeable difference in air quality.
B000BZG5YE|5|I kept getting a check engine light on my 2003 Toyota Land Cruiser. Diagnostics revealed I had a couple of bad oxygen sensors. I decided to go ahead and replaced all four oxygen sensors. It was a huge pain in the ass to get the old sensors out, but I saved close to $1000 by purchasing the new sensors through Amazon and doing the job myself. No more check engine lights.
B005IDVL5M|5|Luckily I did not have a flat tire, but this works real well when you need to get under your trailer!! It will give you enough clearance to change a flat tire for sure!!
B004DLV4U2|5|Perfect fit for my 4 cylinder Toyota Camry 2000. For twenty bucks it was a bargain.
B006GB4JGI|1|Pros:  Powder coat is good<br /><br />Cons:  Horrible design, no mounting hardware, instructions are difficult to read, after install the guards can easily be pulled from the body of the vehicle, I know because that's how I took them off to return them.<br /><br />Mounting these guards involves bending three metal tabs around your tail light housing, the tabs have a sticky tape on them (which rubs off the second the tailight shifts position) and then replacing the whole unit on the vehicle.  No hardware, no mounting of any type, just bend three tabs around the tail light and you're done.  After install the guards shifted position easily and I was afraid they would come off in traffic, so I removed them.  To do so I simply gave them a tug and they came right off.  I didn't have to pull hard, and for an accessory aimed at protecting your vehicle from off road damage,,,,,this one sucks.<br /><br />Oh, and good luck getting yours to look like the picture to, no way!  I messed with my set for 2 hours trying to get them to be even close to symmetric, and centered around the tailight, maybe that's the reason they only have 1 tail light guard shown, with only 1 picture in the listing!<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend buying this product, I have sent my set back to the manufacturer.
B005DXNKU6|5|I looked at other more expensive front baskets, but the Guide Gear basket has them all beat on price and quality.  It was easy to install on my Honda Rancher, but as other reviews mentioned, it is faster it you have help from a person with small hands.  I've used the basket to carry tools and my chainsaw into the woods and everything rides fine.  I really like how handy it is to put tools in without having to strap them down.  Great product at a great price.
B003LF30CG|5|These glove were purchased for a model who I was featuring on my book cover for my novel Cindy's Revenge. They looked absolutely great on my model and the book cover turned out awesome
B0073DTM0Q|5|Works as avwrtised
B009SQZEUI|5|T-bolt clamps are the preferred way to connect the pipes and coupling hoses for air intake systems. They work much better than worm screw type hose clamps because they don't loosen up and do not cut into the coupling hoses.  T-bolt clamp can be rather pricey so I took a chance on these budget clamps and was pleasantly surprised.  The seller sent them out promptly.
B00GA9WR3I|5|Secured my trailer extremely well.  This unit is much better and more secure than any other ball hitch lock I have ever owned.  Exceptionally satisfied with the purchase.
B000C5HM6I|5|Nothing fancy, just your standard good quality Motorcraft part.<br />The original one was still good, but I replaced it just in case.<br />Replacement is easy if you've done it a few times before.<br />Overall a good part for half the cost of the dealer.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|They work great and are a lot brighter than the oem bulbs that are on the car from the manufacture!
B0050VH4SA|5|Great color , very nice on your eyes when you get into your car at night . and still bright enough to see what you need to .
B002N4MB6W|5|I put on these wipers as a replacement for Bosch Evolution. Bosch started streaking in a week and smearing in 3-4 weeks.  I have Valeo for 4+ months and they are still good. They are also much narrower (better) than Bosch.
B00EZWCFAM|5|I've only been using it for two months, but so far, so good. It works well, so now just need to see how it lasts. The paint seemed very thin, so I added a couple coats of Imron to the bottom, so it doesn't rust out like my last sled stand.
B003LDROGG|5|Was so happy to find these after failing to find on Toyota website.  They fit our 2011 Toyota Yaris perfectly and were super easy to put on.<br />Other websites had SINGLE hubcap for over $100.  Thank you very much
B000MWW2SO|5|This is much more comfortable than the stock seat. This was the top rated seat on the XLForum, so I took a chance, and do not regret it at all. The quality, fit and finish is top notch. It is also a very stylish seat, and flows with the lines of the bike very well. They also have a seperate pillion seat available separately for a passenger.
B005R84EQG|1|Had to return only available in a small and my boyfriend didn't like the fit.
B0057Y5EFK|5|This is a great socket does what it says to get the Job done in liitle time than you again
B00FMUYTJQ|5|Fast Shipping, No issues. Awesome.
B0024ECDL4|2|Bought two of these to replace less expensive poorly made ones.  One is OK, but I just installed the second for use, and one of the valve handles is broken out of the package.  The brass lever inside the plastic cover is broken off and cannot function.  I removed it and actuate the valve with a pair of needle nose pliers.<br /><br />I cannot find a brand of these on the market that is worth a damn.  I am reduced to fabricating a monster version with pipe fittings and big ball valves for too much money.
B00BCRMBGQ|1|this really sucks didn't fit my car correctly and I doubt it was anybody's car correctly
B0002STSOE|5|[[ASIN:B0002STSOE Lisle 31500 Exhaust and Tail Pipe Cutoff Tool]]    This is a must have tool for the do it yourself guy or gal!

B001TANEOO|5|Works like the original equipment easy to install
B000GKEXWA|4|Ive had this dmm for over a year now and it gets used quite often for checking voltage, continuity, and esp ohms(for car audio installs). Its accurate, and has held up fine.<br />What more is there to say. Cant beat it for the price.
B00II5YD4S|5|good product timely delivery
B002UC1AYQ|4|Works well. Fast delivery!
B006YGRRJ6|5|I had installed a magnaflow 2.75&#34; catback exhaust on my 2011 Ford Fiesta and thought that I wouldn't have to do anything else to it.  Just set it and forget it.  Well, this exhaust was a bit heavier than stock was, so the rubber hangers started to sag quite a bit.  Whenever the engine was idling the exhaust would rattle against the cross member halfway down the chassis.<br /><br />To keep it simple, these hangers are rigid enough to hold the pipe up off that cross member.  You'll only need these.  Once you fight with the rubber ones to get them off the hooks, put some lubricant (WD-40 or PB Blaster) on the hook to make these slide on easier.  Nothing else needed after that.
B009WAAN7E|5|I like these better than the ones that came with the Garmin! The curly cable for car charging I like better than the straight cord.
B00CZG1ZRY|5|Holder worked great.  Actually stays stuck to windshield.  I like because it can be removed easily when not in use.
B001550DVU|1|Ordered this kit to install a Cobra 800w inverter under the back seat of a Jeep Cherokee.  The red wire ended up being shorter than the black wire.  I didn't notice this until after I had run the negative and ground lines.  I'm having to order a different section of red 4 gauge wiring to get this install complete.
B004J13DTQ|5|Great
B0010G5X6Y|5|Arrived as scheduled.  Well made, just like an OEM product at a fraction of the cost.  After watching a youtube video took on the task and completed the install in a couple of hours
B009JOWSGC|4|very stylish...
B002ZBRYEW|2|When I put stuff on my tires to make them shiny, I actually like them to start quite shiny. Let's face it, it is all down hill from there in the shiny department.<br />But I can not say I was happy with how the tires look from the time I first applied it, let alone days or weeks from now..<br />First, I found it impossible to avoid some over spray. I tried the narrow spray..I tried the wide and either way I got a good deal of over spray. I followed the directions, wiped off the excess and then did all four and assessed. Hmmm..darker, a bit blacker, but pretty dull. So, per the instructions, I applied a second coat with not much improvement. So now I have used twice the product and twice the time.<br /><br />Usually I use a gel product that is applied with a special sponge applicator and honestly, I am much happier with that product.
B00029WYBM|5|great product!
B00771WT8Q|5|I have a 2002 warrior, these pads replaced the stock ones so needless to say mine were old. These work great, I had to learn to hit the brakes MUCH lighter after I put them on since I was used to so little braking power on the worn brakes. Now the front brakes will launch you like superman over the bars and the rears lock the wheels down with the slightest pressure.
B00EJFH6YA|4|Bright! Great light for the price. Hopeful that it won't take on water.
B000RN4GT6|1|This nice-looking device is likely to cost you more money than you think. I used it to check my tire pressure for one year. It turns out that it is totally mis-calibrated. I inflating my tires to the recommended 33 psi using its readings, which turned out to be 36 psi in reality. As a result, my tires showed an unusual wear pattern and my service guy recommended replacement. The Accutire leaflet brags \\"Extend the life of your tires!\\". For me it did the opposite.
B000TKBLHM|5|The Powerpack has come in handy so many different times.  We take it on the road whenever we have a long car ride, just in case.  It has come in handy when the power has gone out to charge phones or provide power to the flashlight that comes with it.  I pump up car tires or air mattresses when we go camping.  It's just a solid handy thing to have.
B003NHBZPG|5|As advertised fast shipping
B000BUTD8Y|4|I used this cover to replace a damaged twin-tank (30lb) cover on my RV. Had a slight issue with assembly; this unit has a top cover that requires you to push a pair of hold-down bolts into one-half of the shell. Mine would not fit until I took a box cutter and removed some of the casting flash that had overlapped into the holes. After that, no problems. Nuts included are 9mm, kind of an odd size. Instructions suggest using pliers to hold them during assembly but I used my 9mm wrench instead.  Unit is very white. Plastic is very heavy gauge, much heavier than the original cover.
B0026I5Z22|4|The install is both a lot of work, and must be fairly precisely done. A dremel rotary tool with a flexible shaft attachment, and cutting wheel makes short work of most hood materials, and is what I'd recommend for this task. Take your time, and go slow removing material and test fitting the aerocatches.<br /><br />Once it's all installed it looks almost like a factory option, and functions great.
B000KYUP7Y|5|I've been without a keyless remote for some years now.  I wanted to purchase one but I didn't want to pay over $100.00 for it!  I didn't even know I could order this until I mentioned it to my brother, whose a mechanic.  He looked it up for me through Amazon, which is my go to for any and everything!  I found the exact remote for my truck.  I received timely, even sooner than I thought I would.  It was so easy to program, the directions were perfect! Now I'm enjoying using my keyless remote!  Thank you Amazon!
B00757KJTI|5|Let me start by saying this small antenna works great! My new 2013 Tundra Crew Max came with the regular truck antenna, which made it a pain tot run the truck through a local car wash. I had to keep removing and installing the antenna. The Stubby Antenna fixed that. I get great reception with the Stubby Antenna, no signal loss that I can tell. Its also so small that it barely peeks above the hood, and is very stylish. I'd definitely recommend for any Tundra owners!
B004M3ICVU|5|Great description on disassembling and assembling parts, and what special tools necessary to finish the job.
B0038AVEEU|3|07 f250 super duty xl. Driver side fit perfectly. Passenger side turn signal did not. Notches for plug were backwards. Had to cut out new notches so when you plug mount in and turn to right and down the housing fits and light is able to recess. Now have to get plug adapter to go from standard to led and orange bulb for turn signals.<br />They look sharp though so worth it.
B003CXRV90|5|I pondered and searched for many weeks; the cheap covers, the expensive covers, the pros the cons. Finally, I took the plunge with optimism and ordered this cover. It arrived quickly and it seemed bigger than i'd expected. Back in the day, I always bought covers for my motorcycle, and none of them looked this plush! The first time trying to put this cover on the car, it was well... I thought I needed about 4 more hands. It took a couple times, but mastering it was simple. When the AZ summer sun hits 120 degrees, my sport coup is protected. There was a giant storm the blew through with 60 mph winds and 2 minutes of rain. Every car on the block had that special post storm speckled look. Not mine though!!! I haven't poked a hole for the antenna. I keep the antenna in the front seat. for the easiest way to install it: put the logo name on your hood; stick the side mirrors in the 'ear' looking things; pull the front over your hood, then the back over the back. TADA!!! that's it. The cover is soft, strong, has tiny air hole type impressions that I think keeps damp air from being trapped on your car.
B0012C1BN0|5|I used this as an accent around the shop, easy peel nd easy application without any problems within the last 6 moths exposed to a variety of conditions.
B001O7PNNM|5|Excellent product would recommend to anyone that wants to use it.
B000R3SNJU|3|I get no response on the Innova 3140 after plugging into the OBD1 connector on my 1991 Chevrolet G30 Van.    According to the manufacturer Equus, the Innova 3140 \\"Scan Tool CanOBD2&1 Kit ... [is] Designed to retrieve OEM Enhanced and Transmission diagnostic codes in all OBD2 (1996 and newer) and some of the most popular OBD1 (1981 to 1995) vehicles\\" and \\"OBD1 Coverage:  General Motors - 1982 to 1993 and some 1994 to 1995 models\\" (see [...] )    According to Amazon.com, the Innova 3140 is \\"Designed to retrieve diagnostic codes in all OBD2 (1996 and newer) and some of the most popular OBD1 (1981 to 1995) vehicles\\" and the \\"Innova 3140 can also perform diagnostic scans for the following OBD I vehicles: General Motors: all 1982 - 1993, ...\\".  (see  http://www.amazon.com/INNOVA-3140-Diagnostic-Scanner-Vehicles/dp/B000R3SNJU/ ).    According to Walmart, the least informative site, \\"The Equus 3140 Scanner is specially designed to retrieve OEM Enhanced and Transmission diagnostic codes in all OBD2 (1996 and newer) and some of the most popular OBD1 (1981 to 1995) vehicles.\\" (see [...] ).    The manufacturer's site (Equus) and Amazon.com both clearly state that the Innova 3140 can scan ALL 1982-1993 GM vehicles, without further qualifications.    After I bought the tool and reviewed the included instructions, I tried to scan my 1991 Chevy Van. I got through several steps up to and including \\"Enter the 8th digit of VIN\\", but that was all. The tool gave an error message and went no further.    Later, I visited the Innova website page for this particular product (Innova 3140) and downloaded the manual ( [...] ). Only after reading page 97 did I come to learn that the tool would ONLY scan 1982-1993 Chevy G30 Vans with GASOLINE engines, not those with a diesel engine like mine.    I do not think it's anywhere close to fair to have to research the tool at the manufacturer's and several vendors' websites, buy the tool, follow supplied instructions to try to connect to my OBD1 van, download an expanded manual not supplied with the product, study it and then, and only then, discover that the tool cannot even do a simple read of the DTC on my van - let alone perform a scan.    I have three vehicles ('90 Honda Civic non-OBD, '91 Chevy Van G30 6.2L OBD1/ALDL, '01 Nissan Sentra 1.8L OBD2). I fully expected this tool to be as-advertised useful for two of them (Chevy Van and Nissan Sentra). Apparently, it can't even fetch vehicle ID from my one OBD2 vehicle ... so it doesn't even seem completely functional for that one. I am having to decide about returning it - a decision that is very uncomfortable for me having thought I had researched it sufficiently.

B0013V6NBA|5|Looks great on my FR-S!
B001OMLASE|3|I have a 2008 Jeep Wrangler-Sahara Unlimited HARDTOP.  I bought this for the summer, allowing me to store the hard top.  For the most part/season, I love this.  BUT please be aware of some issues.    The big issue is the rain!  There is about a 2 Inch gap between the door and the top and it costs about $300 to purchase a rail kit (surrounds that cover this 2 inch gap).   BUT a NOODLE works great for this.  Yes, a swimming noodle.  I measured the length based on the width of the front drivers window and mounted it using the excess velcro straps that are built into the soft top (3 straps for the front).  So far so good!!    2nd issue, you cannot temporarily roll this up.  It's either on or off.  I wish there was a way to roll it up towards the window and bind it.  Then unroll when you want to cover again.  You can remove the back part by unzipping. BUT you cannot have the back w/out the front.    3rd issue, does not fit snugly on the sides.  Has a tendancy to pull loose some ...and flap.  (in between front/rear doors).
B000BYB5A4|5|Work great got what we expected. Very pleased
B009F5E8O0|5|Great fit!!!  Came with all the hardware.  As this was welded and in one piece, I needed to use a come along to align one side with the bolts holding the other side. This was to be expected as the hitch is SUPER HEAVY DUTY!!  Great
B001EMFOMM|5|I bought these for my 2000 Camaro SS. They are very thing and plush. The color is slightly different than the Ebony interior, but I think it is is supposed to be that way. Added a nice touch to my plastic filled F body.

B001A3ER3C|5|Firstgear,<br /><br />This thing is amazing water proof, keeps me warm on 35 degree day with out any issues just wish I could have gotten in red and black not gray and black.
B0045L8YN0|5|Easy to apply. Would have rather a stream instead of a spray though. Kind of gets everywhere instead of right on the chain.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Easy to follow directions, great product.
B0049MVBMG|5|I was able to install the tow hitch receiver in a flash and it fits perfectly into my 2001 Toyota Tacoma.
B002SG9J6K|4|These lights are what everyone else is saying, small but bright, however they a lot more purple rather than blue... Still look great though and would recommend...
B000H0KMEC|2|Didn't last 6 months. I just replaced this a burnt out bulb with this one, and within months, a coworker asked why I hadn't gotten that burnt out bulb replaced yet. Sure enough, the headlight was out again. I had it checked to make sure it wasn't a bad connection in. Everything was fine. It was this cheap bulb. It didn't last. Not worth the money.
B005DUK90S|2|I was looking for pure white. These were a blue white or &#34;cool white&#34; and not as bright as the incandescent ones they replaced. Still looks decent so I will keep them.  6 Months later: Had to drop a star since 2 of the bulbs failed, they started blinking randomly which made things interesting. The other things I have noticed are the fact that the lights are not a bright as I would have liked. I am thinking about replacing them now with some brighter, whiter, LED's.
B00853A4TQ|5|I do limited scope home repair for a non-profit.  This has helped me more times than I can count.  I had my mechanic install it but he said it was so easy he didn't even charge me.  Flips easily.
B002P8H8V4|5|Direct fit, perfect, perfect, perfect.
B001W6LGGS|4|I have been looking for a wireless backup camera for years, so when I found this one for $100, I thought I'd try it out.  Below are my key observations, and not that I am willing to give extra forgiveness due to the relatively low cost.  I installed it in my 2006 Odyssey.  - This does NOT take 5 minutes to install, at least not in our minivan.  I would estimate 1-2 hours for installation.  I had to pull out one taillight, along with one license plate light and use a fishing cable to feed the wire through.  I broke the plate light housing not realize I was pulling it the wrong way.  Also ruined the rear light wire harness, although no fault of Peak.  My Odyssey's wiring was quite brittle and the wiring kept breaking on me.    - The kit comes with longer license plate screws to handle some extra washers used to tilt the camera down.  Problem is it's too long.  Have to go to Home Depot and get the right sized screw.  Not terrible, just adds more time to the job.  - The genius engineers thought it would make sense to have a flashing blue LED light on the monitor, all the time!  At night this is bright and distracting!  I fixed it by covering it along with the menu button below it (LED light bleeds to the button below) with electrical tape.  - The screen does light up and off on occasion due to interference. Not a big deal, but can be distracting at times.  Bottom line, it's great for the money.  I only had it a week, so no word on long term reliability.
B005CC372E|5|It fit perfect on the trailer.  At first I looked all over and couldn't find one anywhere - parts stores, big box stores even a trailer hitch company.  Actually this one seems safer and easier to lock than the old damaged one that was OEM with the trailer.
B00NHMAJ40|5|Excellent customer service. Product works great and appears to be well made
B000IG5PZQ|1|This clock worked for a few days and then started randomly cycling through various modes.  Don't waste your money.
B00AOIM2CC|5|So nice to know what's going on with my car.  I use it with the DashCommand app on my iPad and it works great.
B000CJ43LQ|5|I'm pretty happy with this floor mat, it became a cheap option to replacing ny 20 year old truck's original permanent floor mat. The only thing I have to say negative about the mat is that is smelled bad. I don't know why it smells so bad, but it smells like bad B.O. Only really noticeable on hot days with the windows left up, I'm hoping it dissapiates as time goes on. Other than that smell...I'm very happy with it.
B0015PRU34|3|The installation on my 1999 toyota tacoma was pretty easy. The headlight assembly definitely improved the appearance of my truck. I would have to agree with the other review about the beam pattern being terrible. There are dark streaks throughout. I will probably just add some driving lights because I do like the overall appearance.
B004AINV1S|5|just on time,,, thanks !!!
B0000AXDOY|5|Wisper quiet and works great..
B001CEG90I|5|fast service , works fine.
B005GHB5U6|2|this kinda mask is for people with big heads. also cant wear it with a helmet which sucks but expected.
B005WIC6KW|5|Fast delivery great price
B003M8FJ4E|3|Product is great, works as advertised. My only problem lies with the fact that the front deflectors are not packaged as securely as the rears and both sides arrived scuffed. Unfortunately I didn't realize this until a few weeks after receiving them as I needed to wait until my windows were tinted before I installed them.
B00P64H6LG|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Very bright, for as small as they are.
B0002Z9R5M|5|Best I have tried yet, great in rain good with snow
B000EAIERW|5|These worked great on my friends 2006 Wrangler...He loves them!  Although there is no buckle involved, there is plenty of hook and loop velcro to ensure their sturdiness.
B000BPLNXC|3|good for the cost.
B00ELJ9A3O|5|smaller than i expected but still cute.
B003L3IUBY|5|I needed these for one of my bike wheels. . . .worked out great after some drilling of the rim!!!!
B001PYQWKC|4|Item mostly as described, shipped quickly, good quality parts. Fitment for a 1999 k1500, bolted right on.  Be advised that these are left / right side specific, not universal fit.
B00BSN1HP0|1|i just got it today by mail and i can tell you guys this is a bad quality product, it looks so home made, my printer has way better resolution unfortunately it is a small printer, my over wall satisfaction from 01 to 10 = 01, for the price of the product and the quality is becomes to expensive. But shipping they are fast, i wish i was slow but good quality on the sticker i'm not asking for money back i will end using this poor quality product i already paid for but i advice any one in here DO NOT BUY.......
B0091YV1F4|5|Love it
B00IJ1FRNW|3|Got this along with their leather conditioner and both worked exceptionally well.  However, I’m only giving it 3 stars since the bottle leaked during shipment.  Sure wish that Amazon would have packed it better. Product was great though, just had to use it from a cracked sprayer due to the poor packaging.
B00LESMYR4|5|i looks really good on my fourwheeler
B006OQ35GU|5|Worked very well.  Easily twist on to trailer drain and hose with no tools necc.  Can now see when sewage turns clear in line.
B0035LGTLA|5|Could not have fit better on my 2006 F-350!
B005XROZVA|4|The quality is great, you do have to cut out a small 2&#34; squar hole for them to fit. The hole was a snap for a roto zip and does not effect the structure or prevent you from putting thre old lights back in. The wiring is plug and play and bolts to the  battery post with ease. The wiring to the drivers side could have been longer so I could have routed it on the firewall instead of banjoed across the air breather, The pasenger lense seems to have a wider gap on the right side grill to lense, this could be the angle but I have read it on hear before. The sun is going down and I have to go drive it to see if the lights need adjusted. I mesured from the clip guige to the nut base that rides on the base to match the old ones.I took several mesurments. Look carfully when pulling the old headlights off to see how they ride on the grove. Pull the side lamps first and put the sides on last. They look great.
B000R9NMQ8|3|I picked this thing up 8 months ago. It's okay and fits, but it's pretty chinsey. I'll continue to use it because I'm sure it's safe, but I wouldn't buy it again knowing what I know now.
B004O844DS|5|It took a little adjusting to fit on the cargo rack as the holes were not drilled in the right places but we made it work and it is the perfect size for our jeep patriot.
B0006309YS|1|The leather wrapping is very nice and well made.  The problem is the base/neck of the shift knob broke in 30 days while I was driving.  The metal part does not hold up even for 30 days.  Very disappointed.
B00KQ4ZMX0|4|Worked good on my 2014 mustang
B006BDW0G2|5|Key worked out great
B005NLQAHS|5|Initially bought the blue one for half the price and it was garbage, wouldn't connect to the cars diagnostics, this BAFX OBD though works perfect with torque on the first try, on the three cars I used it with, great product
B004O2P2CG|4|Perfect fit and well built<br />I like the extra security of the lock nut washers
B005FMU21U|5|Bought for spare parts, have not installed in vehicle, sue it will work fine.
B004O9WC18|5|Very happy with this rear cargo mat. Fit perfectly in my 2015 Grand Cherokee. Exact match to my previous purchase of the front and rear slush mats.
B003AVLC2Q|5|This worked great on my Jeep TJ. The sway bar bushings install easily and the sway bar link bushings are also not too bad to install. I did not use the poly joint boot supplied because I didn't cut my boots with a pickling fork removing them.
B000C5UFW6|5|I bought this to fix CEL code p1167/p1166  for honda accord 2002 ULEV  engine. Perfect fit. CEL has not returned for 2 days now. Don't be even attempt cheap non oem oxygen sensors for this car.I had tried denso  o2 sensor part no 234-4620 and still got code p1166 a minute later.I hope this can help someone. If your honda accord engine is ULEV , meets both California and federal emission standards, this is your oxygen sensor
B004BCCAZ6|5|These lights were wonderful and were a match for my truck.  They snapped in perfectly and I was happy with them.
B0013V6NBA|5|Great looking and very unique, good value
B000COWMUU|1|I bought this item for a 2003 Sonoma. Carpet was very poor quality and it has terrible oder to it. The holes were not marked as advertised and it is too narrow for my vehicle. The rubber/vinyl wear areas were not even close to where should be. There was no padding on half of it.<br />I am making a trip to the auto recycler and hopefully I can find something decent.<br />$152 down the tube. I just hope no one else buys this P.O.S.
B006ODSZRW|5|It is nicely constructed but was not for my C109.  Not sure why it came up in a search for the C109 but it was my fault for not paying attention
B00N48G55O|5|Put one  in the work truck, Love it.
B000C40SEM|4|These were good shocks for the price and the great service from Just Suspension. Replacements for a 2004 2WD Silverado, went on ok, the hardware is not as good as OE but for the price it restored the ride to the truck.
B000OCKHV6|5|Quality product, works great
B000C9JNDE|5|Bought these for my 1994 corvette.<br />I matched  ACDelco 18A288 Professional Durastop rotors with an ACDelco 14D413MH Advantage Semi-Metallic Rear Disc Brake Pad Set and I couldn't be happier. I thought about upgraded to drilled and slotted rotors but my car stops on the dime now.<br />I matched front and rear rotors and pads and the car stops like new. I wouldn't take chances with some discount unknown brand when these are inexpensive and work so well.
B000JZ8X32|5|Thanks
B000MU75MO|5|I have used this type bleeder screw before on a Corvette. These I used on my ford truck. This is a great way to bleed brakes by yourself. Good price, good product, quick shipping.
B00QQXK3HU|1|Poor quality. Poor packaging.
B001GDWOJA|3|I got a brand new honda fit 2010, and somehow i decided to get some covers coz i didnt like the non-leather seats.  I was going to buy the purple one, but this was more appealing for my mom whose opinions are \\"vital\\".  I got the package like 2 days later (which i would rather wait if the shipping fee can be lowered).      The covers smelled and looked super cheap when i opened the package.  THen I thought no wonder most ppl brought the black one and that was probably why no one reviewed this pink set.      Then it took like forever to install.  The covers for the headsets are way 2 big, though i was previously warned by a review (the reviewer also owns a fit), but i didnt think it would be this much awkwardly large.  The rear seats were the worse.  I almost got into a fight with my mom b/c it was my idea that we should get covers (she started complaining it was such waste of money, no one gets covers for his/her cars........)      after all the pain-in-the-ass installment, i was still a little upset with the finish look.  well, it was my choice after all.
B00H8Z3I2C|5|I love it; will purchase more for friends and family.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  I hope it never wears out; if it does, I will order another.  Happy, Happy, Happy
B00GOQFAZ4|5|Incredible look and product for the price ... look great on the bike, easy to put on and use ... Love em
B00GRHSU5C|4|Just what I wanted works perfect.  Helps out with my jeep hair when I get to work.  Only complaint is the center Velcro was off center and unusable.  Didn't really effect the rest of the cover its just annoying to look up and see.
B000FQ7GCE|5|Looked good and worked well in a 1980 CJ5. I never tested how well it worked in a crash. YMMV.
B000WJ75J8|4|needs redesign regarding velcro strap placement<br /><br />one of the velcro straps is directly in the way of the seat latch
B006LO4L6I|5|Had to take the wire harness off the old batteries and connect to these. Had to get the connectors at the store but those are cheap. Holds a charge and runs great.
B006RVQKQY|1|Just put it on my 2013 Toyota Tundra and it look fantastic. It really gives it a nice off road racing tuff look. My truck is black and my grill is chrome and black and the slight red color on this really stands out. Installation is more then simple all you will need is a small pair of pliers to tighten it at the end. But it looks great!!!
B0009JKI6I|5|Works as advertised on my 1992 Jeep Cherokee
B001C6Q8BQ|5|This was the second one i had to purchase.  The first one was from an auto parts store.  The part ordered off of Amazon was exactly the same as the Auto Parts store, just much cheaper.
B00SJWJ2Q4|5|My daughter loves it!
B005C5XS2U|5|The fit was perfect. Glad I found out about these. I will definitely buy more and hope I can get one for my car!
B009PDB0N4|4|The fob that I received wasn't brand new, but it was in great shape and it works great.  The truck release doesn't work with my car, but I wasn't counting on using that button anyway.<br /><br />For the price, you can't beat it.  This was a great deal.
B0007M43QI|4|good item worth the price only 2 problems for me. First for the outside thermometer its kind of hard to find a place to put it in without it being affected either by the heat of engine or direct sunlight or the heat of transmission or the wind when vehicle is in motion and second you can only uses the light when you connect it to the lighter its not either battery or lighter plug  which for me makes my inside of the car look cluttery with all the wires that i have
B0059XEM9I|3|I agree that it does look nice but it sticks on like poop. It doesnt stick. After applying this product onto my car, it started to peel off after a few days. Its too stiff. Can't put it on some angles
B00JL806LA|5|Fit perfectly.  Good and steady. Truck looks a whole lot better.
B00HUHA3AS|1|This was not what I expected
B003Y3066S|5|These days it's surprising to see such good quality at a reasonable price. They are exactly what I was looking for in a surface mount tie down. Good design, low profile so I won't trip on them while loading my bikes. Much better than using I-bolts.
B004885CE4|5|Fit perfect!!!!  really helps in wet weather season saving the carpet .
B006QAUIDC|5|Perfect product in perfect condition.
B00KJ17QNO|5|It is so bright will buy more
B0076N3Z60|5|Worked great.  Good price.
B000Z0HVHA|1|I needed an extension for a roof light on my truck.It would not stay in the socket,even tried to tape it. Not a good product,would not recommend to anyone.
B005C2BZLY|5|Happy with outcome of these LEDs,very bright,lights up car,after a stumble with seller,they came thru in jiffy,kudos to the Comfort Wheels team...thanx a lot
B0093RRSXS|5|Excellent Product!!!
B00G4C2PFG|5|item as described no problems.
B0064FY1VO|5|Not sure about the negative reviews, mine have been in for 6 months and great so far.  Nice yellow light, good brightness and the yellow light is really good for cutting through fog/mist as that is the optimal color to do it.  I have to assume that half the reviews where a bulb is burnt out the person installing them touched the bulb with their finger or didn't clean the bulbs off with rubbing alcohol and a lint free cloth prior to install which can cause them to burn out really fast.
B000CN74PE|5|Fit great
B00495UQT2|5|I was pleased with the pump and bottle since someone had removed the original on my 2002 Mazda Miata. This thing fit like a glove and the price was great as well. I will try to post some pictures so that other Miata owners can see where it mounted. This is a common problem when running modified.
B000OL08ES|5|This was a nice quality product. My husband loved his new hitch cover.He even bought one for his dad and grandpa.
B002OQXIS4|4|I installed this relay so I could charge my camper battery while driving, but disconnect it from the engine to avoid draining the starter batter. It has a very positive and forceful on/off snap, which I hope signifies its high current carrying capacity.
B000E7YP7I|5|The most helpful organizer for groceries.  Very stable and solid!
B00A0TE0KM|5|Cute
B0009JKGFG|5|Easy on. Easy off. ..... Does a wonderful job .....very much recommended
B001U8QS9I|5|I had bought an older version of these. After three years of constant sunshine, the black portion faded and needed to replace the old ones. I decided to buy this brand again, and I do not regret it! They were super easy to install, and look great. My 1994 Camaro sports these seat covers like no other.
B003BZWR4S|5|It's gaffer's tape and it works great.<br /><br />I've used it on tons of things already and it's held up well so far.  As with gaffer's tape in general, I love the sticky, yet low residue adhesive used (vs duct tape and many other tapes that always leave a sticky mess behind).
B0023VDKTW|5|It's good
B0024GQ0WK|5|I received this beautiful 1/2 helmet in a matter of days (free shipping, to boot)!  It is an excellent looking & fitting helmet.  Exactly what I wanted & needed, at a price that won't be beat anywhere on the internet..  Well made & constructed, even came with an embroidered cover/bag, to protect it.  I am thoroughly pleased with this product, & would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, quality, 1/2 helmet.
B00B1PNIO8|2|perfect for my Mini Cooper s , but I pay for the original brand and received a replacement brand
B009VMT8KQ|5|Just right we put it on our silver car and it looks great! wish I had ordered two.<br />I am from Lake Tahoe.
B007Q13TQI|5|These are THE gaskets to get for an LS1/LS6 with aftermarket headers. These are individual gaskets so you will need 2 of them. The ones that came with my headers were crap so used these. Have used them before with great results. Amazon has them in stock and a great price.
B00NEU5490|5|My daughter loved it
B00280BL9O|4|Simple easy to use with no problems so far. Straight forward and seems to seal tight around the valve stem.
B0023GM2KK|4|makes good seal
B00LV3M1A2|5|All good! No complaints!
B000EQ6FI6|4|Pads showed up quickly, easy to install and act just as OEM. No complaints here
B000630J8E|3|Files cast rings pretty quickly and does nicely with steel rings.  Only complaint that I have is that it is difficult to use with smaller bores (75mm/3\\")but seems like it would work great for larger bores. I had to feed the ring in from the other side to file the smaller bore rings.
B004SFKJIQ|5|i'd buy again
B000BLNTPQ|5|very bright for my reverse light up grade and modified reverse light for my tacoma, i can see better at night when i back up
B00CO85X94|3|I bought the butterfly and peace versions of this key chain and they are beautiful on one side, but the other side is just a silver-ish metal slab with black lettering reading &#34;Dan Morris,&#34; &#34;Made in China,&#34; and a copyright warning. There is nothing really wrong with the key chain, but it just feels cheaper than I thought it would.
B00CD86LXW|5|Makes my 2005 honda 250 recon look better. The seat was brand new still in plastic inside a plastics bag. It fit like a glove! Would recommend this product to others.
B005FYQQIQ|5|Looks great on my raptor 250 DOESNT WORK WITH STOCK HANDLEBARS!!! Clamps get in way your quad must have protaper handlebars or a crossbar on the stock handlebars
B000EGL6C6|4|The glasspack from Cherry Bomb came quick and was pretty difficult to install but that was not due to the part.  I ordered 2.5\\" inlet/outlet and my pipes were the same size and so I had to have a friend of mine do it but anyway the sound is great, it's got a nice rumble at the low RPMs and isn't too loud at the higher RPMs.  Definitely a head turner.
B005NYDSCU|5|ordered to complement the clear side markers on my car, product arrived on-time and has been working perfectly ever since i installed the bulbs. The orange hue is much richer, too, compared with conventional orange-colored bulbs - the latter tend to have an almost whitish glare, not so here.
B00B1M3224|5|My kids got this for me I laughed and put them in the back window of the ride. They are great
B001GMX9FO|5|How much is your time worth? I bought this because my car is leased and I did not want to modify wiring. It is really plug and play. It installed in less than a half hour.
B001BXKLNQ|5|bussman is known for high quality automotive electrical wiring components.<br /> This is a sturdy little fuse block.<br />It is not super high capacity, I would not use it on the space shuttle or a nuclear reactor<br />I am using it to build a wiring harness for my motorcycle<br /> 6 fuses.<br /> no cover so it is not weather  or dust proof.
B003RQBKLC|5|I got this so I could run a GPS and a dash cam at the same time off my lighter socket, which it does without problem.
B007RJLJ7A|5|Replaced my factory antenna which was too long for the car. I love the short antenna style of it. Looks great. Cheap price.
B000JU1F1E|5|The Lucky Line coin purse is the best, squeeze coin purse I've ever owned.  As a child, my grandfather would occasionally give me plastic, squeeze purses, and they would all wear out over time.  Nonetheless, I liked them.  As an adult, I bought three:  one to use and the other two as replacements as they wore out.  Well, it's been over 5 years and the first has yet to wear out!.  No chipping, breaks, brittleness or cracking.  No losing of suppleness or spring.  I'm so impressed that I'm leaving a review even though I didn't buy mine from Amazon.
B00QXHXZ8S|1|So called unaversal not really<br />It don't fit
B000BKJDKM|5|OK
B002GQDABM|4|It's not a Yakima Megawarrior stretch net, but for the money, this is product a great buy for casual use.
B001DHJ9WY|5|After getting a quote of $1500 from a mechanic to replace a bad compressor, tried it myself...only thing, make sure you buy new O-rings (and replace the drier, too). Comes with oil. And you have to vacuum out the system before recharging. Total cost, including buying a pump and gauges , under $400. Seriously, mechanics, are you kidding?
B00G620ZVU|5|Easy to mount and are really bright. Great purchase. Got money's worth.
B00IBOKPHK|2|Does not fit 2015 Honda Accord Sedan. When Amazon gives you the option to see if it fits your vehicle, it doesn't give you the option to select Sedan or Coupe. This is for the Accord Coupe only. Don't be fool. Also, on the box it states for 2013/2014 Honda Accord and it doesn't say whether it's for the Sedan or Coupe. I knew something was wrong for the reason that rear carpet does not fit. I actually believed that they can't all be a perfect fit so I just left it as it is.
B004P1WM7Y|3|So far the top looks good but installation wasn't so easy .... The video showed easy and to slide the clamps...the front 2 clamps did not slide with ease. I actually had to get a small hammer and tap both slides
B007580G7W|5|OEM, excellent quality, excellent fit.  Would purchase again if ever needed.
B000BQQP1Q|5|I have had it covering my winch for several months now and it works great, even stays put at interstate speeds.  I did have to use some bungee cords to help secure it, my only complaint.
B00A9X2SGM|5|I purchased a Polaris Xpress 300, very rough shape, the ignition switch was gone, this replacement was high quality, Works Great!!!!  If I had to I'd order from this sellar again, perfect, very speedy transaction.
B00E25AJFK|4|Well made,great packaging,easy install and a good price point. And the sound  makes this a very good buy
B000FV6TUE|5|Great fir, easy better than expected.
B000Q0U7Q6|5|great product,,,,but,,,don't forget to order your intake gaskets also
B000F6F99G|5|Works great and easy to install.  No more markers hanging from my garage ceiling.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I first saw this on shark tank and always said to myself that when it came out I would buy it and I did!  I bought 3 of them for myself and Christmas gifts and I have to say that I and everyone I gave to for Christmas love it!  It really works!  I recommend this to everyone with a vehicle!
B006RQ44O4|5|I went out on a limb getting this being it states it is for gas models and not diesel but it works! I adjusted my speedo using the Hypertech along side my gps to dial it in. My tires are 32.1 inches tall but entering a 32 inch tire put my speedo from being 6 miles under to being 2 miles over @ 60 mph. I was able to dial it in by entering 30.75 inches for tire height and that finally matched up my gps and speedo. I like it, it's simple to use and even gives the option to adjust gear ratio which will be helpful for me in the future. 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee CRD
B000BZEHZ8|5|These fit and worked great just like they were OEM parts. Very pleased! Be sure to soak the threads of the ones still in the vehicle with penetrating oil for 2-3 days and they will come out a lot easier so you can put these new parts in. It really was that easy.
B000WJEORY|5|Excellent works perfectly and 2/3rds the price of the one Harley charge.
B00HUAFRVK|5|I love the fact that you can control how strong of a scent that you like in your car. Some freshener are so strong as you are well aware! Highly recommend this freshener.
B000CO9NUW|5|works as expected
B00PVU8VL4|5|Perfect!
B000E3BVVA|3|You get what you pay for. Not bad for the price but I may buy a better one, I had to take it apart and adjust it before I could use it. Roll axis was way off leaning to the left. It was a simple adjustment after I opened it up.
B00AKQAD88|5|This was a unique gift and was well made, well priced and I was asked many times to divulge where I got it.
B000W0RQ8C|5|Hi All.  I have used all different Brands of Receiver Locks over the past 45 years as RV'ers.  This is well made and should hold up for a long time.  The Rubber Dust Cap is pretty nice to have on these also, to keep the dirt and dust and water out of the lock.  A good inside clean lock, is a good working lock.  We sure couldn't complain about the cost of this one.  I have paid a lot more for 2 inch Receiver Locks in the past, and they haven't been as good as this one is.  I have alwasy replace the old fashioned Hitch Pins with the Clips with 2 inch Receiver Locks.  That way no one can mess with any of your RV Hook-Ups.  And you also don't have to ever worry about a pin comming out, and having your old fashioned Hitch Pin fall out.  I use one Receiver Lock, to lock our Tow Bar to our Motorhome.  And I use two more Reveiver Locks to lock the Tow Bar to the front Basp Plate of our Toad being Towed 4 Down.  Nobody can ever mess with this set-up, and noting is ever going to come undone on its own, ever.  Happy Travels
B00MH71O7C|4|Arrived on time and packaged well. Fits as advertised. My only compliant is that some of the holes for the mounting brackets didn't square up in the center of the oem mounting holes and the clearance for the front inner bolt location is tight. Took awhile to get the threads started. That's my only compliant and gave it 4 stars. Use brake cleaner to remove the protective plastic residue from the chrome trim or heat it up with a blow dryer as you peel. Makes life easier.
B000VB87XA|5|These looms are just what I was looking for.  They're easy to install and great looking in my street rod.
B005HFQCUU|3|They are okay, I was expecting a slightly different way of strapping them on instead of two crossed elastic bands that your arm slides through. I expect them to slide down my forearm if its a rough enough ride, but maybe they will surprise me.
B000QUZ6TO|1|this cap sucks you have to lock it back with key does not auto lock like other fuel caps do
B0002JN3G2|4|Works- but not as good as a $30 wiper.  But it is not one of those.  I noticed some streaking but it is on passenger side so it does not matter to me.
B000CGFFE8|5|Exact fit for wore out mounts. Fit my 1998 Civic DX nicely. It might be cheap but they fit perfectly and work well.
B004QBNA8I|5|I broke the original drivers side door handle.  I replaced with this one and it matched perfectly.  Very easy to install, about 20 min in driveway.
B002ZBY9HW|5|Fantastic!
B00D3XUUJM|5|:)
B002E5FOR8|5|This works perfect in my 2k7 prius sitting on dubs.<br />I had no air now I got more air then a 747 jet blasting off!<br /><br />This blower is going H.A.M just like Daym Drops 5 guys song.<br /><br />Shout out to prius chat .com for the guide
B00BCH4WZE|3|this is o.k. but not as good as the original one I once had and can no longer find.  one from Walmart works just as well.
B0027XYKZO|5|Excellent gaskets been using Fel Pro for years and have always been pleased with their quality and price as well.
B004PXAUGC|5|Fast shipping and great price.
B002HXSA4Q|5|Looks great on my 03 Ford Escape.
B0017K4HI8|4|Great cover. Does the job!
B000KZ0IUM|3|WHEN I ORDERED THESE REMOTES THE INFORMATION STATED MEMORY #1, i THOUGHT THE REMOTE WOULD HAVE  THE NUMBER 1 STAMPED ON FOB JUST LIKE THE ONES TAHT CAME WITH THE CAR. THAT WAS THE REASON I ORDERED THEM, AND PAIDEDMORE MONEY FOR THE FOB'S.  NOT VERY HAPPY.
B004TRKBOK|5|Fortunately have not had to use it!
B00BI2APMW|5|Smaller than other devices, which allows it to be kept in a glovebox or other crowded area.  The cable is long enough that I can comfortably keep it in my lap when it's plugged in behind the dashboard.  The interface is simple and clean, the manual is well put together and precise.  I was able to check the engine code and reset them in less than 5 minutes.  The only downside is that I can only clear all codes at once instead of one at a time, but I understand that functionality is reserved for more expensive models.  Can't beat the quality at this price point.
B000GPB3CI|5|works great
B007772I54|5|Great to give your propane tank extra stability.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Been using this for years on cars and boats. Perfect for any plastic, vinyl, rubber, inside or out. 1000x better than other &#34;dash treatments&#34;. Every time I show it to someone else, I create another believer. There is nothing better in this category.
B002P33KVQ|5|This pump was an exact replacement of the original pump. I ordered it overnight and it was at my doorstep the following day. The price (with the overnight charge) was almost the same as other web sites I searched. Great job Amazon!
B008L17JRC|5|easy install, and turn signals and brake lights worked as needed.
B00MM1O70Y|5|Excellent addition for  the price
B006BAMV2S|3|This never worked on my expedition but it may be my fault. Its not a cheap product thats for sure.
B00O9968YA|5|it looks better than I expected and I get a lot of compliments quality product
B0032J1KAK|4|It helps on the road. We are retired and do &#34;road trips&#34;. The traffic out there is crazy. I feel it eliminated the blind spot.
B00F8GRV4E|4|Great helmet however the strap a little too short!
B00C4UPHL6|4|Its plastic but sends out message to those lost and wondered what you talking about.. I've had few people tried convience me not true but a way show them its in the bible and carried bible in my truck and showed them the verse.. can't argue with word of God... good message to share with the lost..
B00MUCHAW2|3|a+++
B003ZCB2E8|4|I thought this was funny when I saw it. My husband is mustang fan so I knew he would like it
B000MIITSU|3|This is a basic, no frills visor CD organizer that does the job. Two attached elastic straps on the back slip over the visor and a small Velcro strap holds it closed. The entire organizer hangs below the visor, so when you flip the visor down, you can still see your mirror on the back. (If you have one...)<br /><br />When it is full, it does bulge open a bit on the sides giving it more of an hourglass shape and adds about an inch of obstruction below the visor which takes a little getting used to. The weight of 20 CD's can also make the visor sag a little, but not enough to make it drop down into your line of sight. I guess you'd have to expect as much from any of this type of visor strap on.<br /><br />The overlapping pockets allow just about 1/2 inch of the edge of the CD's to be visible making it a little difficult to identify which CD is which without pulling them out. (The 2nd picture above makes it look like more of the CD's surface is visible than actually is when they are fully pushed in. I think they pulled them out for effect...) I ended up writing titles on the edge of the CD's with a Sharpie.<br /><br />On the plus side, it does hold the CD's in nice and tightly, so no worries about the CD's slipping out.
B00FT65QN6|2|Did not fit well.when on the vehicle ends are barely reaching and sides are kind of high.Not happy with this  cover
B001AMH80C|5|Fit perfect.  No issues with the product. Still working today.  Been 1 month .......good job good job good job good job
B000JZIW6U|5|I bought these for my Explorer V6 and along with the plugs cetainly made a big difference. As long as squirrels stay out they should hopefuly last a while!
B006QH56GE|4|Removed old battery, placed new one right back in. No modifications required. So far so good!! Hopefully will last a long time like the OEM battery did.
B000FPXSYU|5|For anybody with the 4x4 actuators in the Chevy ifs systems I highly recommend to purchase this works every time no matter what, an easy to install
B001GG2EU6|5|Was exactly what I expected and arrived on time. Perfect green paw prints for my new green car ♡ the colors were even the same shade as my car!
B00AETQYTI|2|Ordered two of these and they both leak at the bottom.
B000CMKG6O|5|This product has already been very thoroughly  reviewed, so I'll just add that it works very well on my 2004 PT Cruiser (base). Not to difficult to self install.
B0051XJM2I|5|Nice, transfers well.
B00DW65LQM|4|Works well.  Does not contain specific codes for Isuzu, so I used GM which I believe gave me the correct readings.  One problem I had was the software update did not work.  Bottom line is that I was able read and clear the codes.
B003UT3S6Q|3|Since my favorite wheel cleaner, Wheel Magic, is apparently discontinued, I had to try others in a search for something that works as well and is as safe for wheels as Wheel Magic was (which, BTW, was an excellent engine compartment cleaner too -- no damage to any paints or plastics).<br /><br />I've used this on some American Racing Torq Thrust Original wheels with moderate road grime and brake dust, and it worked OK.  The Sonax did not affect the shiny machine-turned lips, which was a concern.  However, it was also not too aggressive on brake dust and the only color change noticed was on the lead wheel weights (which turned purple during cleaning).<br /><br />The worst aspect of this Sonax is the smell.  If you've ever been sick to your stomach enough to have puked up bile, then the best way I can describe the way this stuff smells is that Sonax smells like bile tastes.  Yeah, I know -- gross.  It's not strong enough to put me off using the rest of it, but the smell is bad enough that I probably won't buy it again unless I can't find something that works better.
B001COYFNG|5|Great product.  Would definitely recommend.  Be patient installing, takes some time depending on tailgate and how many contours it has.
B00M229MIA|5|Installed for my Polaris 250cc Trailboss and works just fine.
B000E0RAR2|3|a little too large and very bulky. hard to find a good spot to store in the car in between uses.
B000CQBF2O|2|Walker claims in their product description and in correspondence that this muffler provides better than OE performance with regard to sound suppression.  After a cheap imported muffler gave us unsatisfactory exhaust note, which we described as approximating a hippopotamus flatulating through a tuba, we ordered and installed this muffler.  The result was scarcely any different, though our subjective testing had us thinking the Walker's note was slightly less ugly.  But only slightly.  In the effort to prove that a quiet exhaust was possible, we excavated our scrap pile and found a decades-old Midas diamond-plate shell muffler.  After shaking most of the rust out of it, we installed it and started the car.  Even after allowing 15 minutes for the mouse nests to burn away, the exhaust note was quiet, with no roaring or popping (though the burned mouse nest smell was unsatisfying).  Since the rusty old muffler wasn't aesthetically pleasing enough,we were forced to reinstall the Walker, but with a small glass-pack welded in upstream.  The result was tolerable, but still no match for an OE muffler or the tired old Midas.  We need a better option.<br /><br />The Quiet-Flow SS is also claimed to be constructed entirely of stainless steel.  That may be the case, because Walker will tell you the 21394 is not available in a Quiet-Flow SS model.  Read the title of this product, above.  What actually arrived was a Quiet-Flow III, made with a combination of what looks like galvanized and aluminized steel.<br /><br />So, in summary, this may be the best muffler available, but it's not particularly quiet nor pleasing in emitted sound quality, and it's not stainless steel.
B00335M3UE|4|fit my jeep very well, keeps the bugs off. looks good to boot. i have no complaints, i would buy again.
B00BH41C6Y|5|We purchased this as a replacement part. It arrive fairly quickly and in good condition. Item worked as described. We are happy with the purchase.
B0044M7KY4|5|Very beautiful. The colors really make the hummingbird stand out and I enjoy looking at it.  Worth spending the money.
B007USCM7E|1|2009 Subaru Legacy. Followed all of the instructions watched the videos online. It worked until the next day then I had to take it in. The sealant in the can sealed my compressor. Take your can in for a $100 diagnostic before you dump a $40 can of black death in the A/C system. I don't normally write reviews but maybe I will save someone $1000.
B002X6VXL4|1|Didn't work at all out of box. Did charge for 24 hours.  All the cables were connected correctly, but to no avail. Save your money and look somewhere else.
B00F6751L0|5|just what i needed
B000P6UNKQ|5|Mount on  my shop wall, and grease gun out of the way, but ready to use when needed. Great product.
B007CTQKVU|5|These lift supports were perfect replacements for the broken old ones and very easy to install. I would order them again. The price was right!
B0088BX0IM|4|This was a very nice addition to the bike. Will come in very handy. It is made of keep plastic, but I knew that before I bought it.  The price was right and I think it will hold out very well for what is going to be used for.
B003L2VYZ4|5|Excellent
B002ZS4QCS|5|Keeps my purse from under my feet, and the second hook keeps the dogs ( dachshunds) from getting into the garbage!
B00CZD7QOS|5|I use this on all the exterior plastic/rubber (not tires though) on my car.  It is easy to apply, just put a very small amount on (it's concentrated) and then wipe it off, without need for a lot of elbow grease!  It keeps my plastic looking great, like new.  I also use it on my windows when I want to make them look like new (both inside and outside) . . . unlike regular glass cleaner (even the special &#34;auto&#34; types) it leaves no streaking on the glass . . . leaves the glass almost invisible.
B0087ZXSV8|1|Nice mirror, but it does NOT fit a Taurus X.  Amazon did, to their credit, refunded the entire cost plus shipping.
B006P88TJ0|5|I ordered 2 for my shooting pal and I, I must say I am extremely satisfied. Shipping was fast and the patches were brand new in great shape. Going on my tactical vest.
B000JZN0NK|5|Great product! No different from OEM and same quality. Very pleased. Will definitely reorder from this vendor and company.Give them a thumbs up.
B008HZOIYO|5|Purchased for a 2004 Lincoln LS - REAR..  Excellent pads...could not be happier.
B002FWYBMO|5|Great Handlebars, pro tapers are always the best. These bars fit on any stock handlebar clamps for 7/8 (which is almost everything) they look amazing and can turn any old Piece of crap dirt bike or quad into a good looking race like one. There lightweight, they have a great design and for the price it does not get any better than this. Hear me out when i say, &#34;these handlebars are the best out there&#34; (I put these on my 1985 KX125)
B000ZAQWWU|3|They are OK for a &#34;custom fit&#34;. It is nothing like neoprene, more like a dense foam. The fit is pretty good but they will not stay in place, and could use a few more straps to help this problem. the vendor did a good job on fairly quick shipping.
B0002WRIG0|4|This is a great, professional quality gauge. The glycerin inside seems to cushion all the parts making for a more durable and more accurate gauge you can keep in your car in just about any temperature condition. Sometimes air builds up in the gauge, and you will notice that the pressure will not read as zero when you get it. This is simply fixed by momentarily unplugging the rubber plug on the back of the gauge. It would be nice if the gauge actually held the pressure after a reading is taken, but it does not.
B0063X46LW|5|I love this cream; no smell and not greasy and works great. I wish it was less expensive though. I was so happy to be able to find it.
B001TZ4I76|5|fits perfect on 91 cheyanne truck seat
B0002NYE5W|2|This does the same thing as Meguiars Ultimate Compound, but with the compound you can use a Duel action buffer and with the clay you can not and if you drop it you have to though it away,,,,I used both to see the Difference and it's about the same ,but with the clay you will spend most of your day trying to rub you cars paint by hand,,,,,so I will not recommend this CLAY,,,,use the compound with the machine to put on and you will save time and money,,,and get better results ,,,,,,,,
B00APD72G2|5|Keep in mind that this is meant to be worn over your clothes and protective gear, so go up one size if you do wear protective pants. If not, usually your motorcycle jacket size will also be your rain suit size.
B001G7CQ3U|5|Great price. Quality parts as described.
B007TY96CI|2|This window regulator worked for 1 year before it started to fail. I give it 2 stars because I do roll my window up and down at least 1 time each work day. So that's roughly 250 up down cycles on the small side and 800 (lunch, drive-throughs, various bad smells needing exhausted) on the likely side. The cable spool is where the failure occurred, not really a user repairable item. on the plus side, the plastic track slides appear to be holding up nicely.
B000CRER3C|1|You get what you paid for. Buy this media in a pack that incorporated all the engine mounts and transmission support. The result has been disappointing, the aspect is of poor quality and result worse. The car was left with a hard vibration, annoying. And after 6 months already broke the gums of the upper and lower brackets. There is no way that I can see the status of the transmission support. Don't recommend it, now I'm looking for the original brackets even though they are more expensive.
B00JGP8I1S|3|Easy to use, but has a gap which does not help
B00GLLW3AM|5|Mounted this pair of lights on my four wheeler, and I am well pleased with the light they provide.
B005ZS091M|5|This fit like a glove and it's great to be back driving safely!  I did have a concer that the double sided tape wouldn't do the job, so I doubled it up. The result was that the mirror didn't fit neatly inside the rim of the frame. However, there seems to be no real negative to this as a little water getting behind wouldn't do damage. Next time, I would just use one layer of the tape.
B000ALG0KS|5|Couldn't be happier with purchase, they were very easy to install. I did the install by myself but it would have been faster with two people, it's been two months since purchase and I've had no problems.
B003SOKEXI|5|Great product fit great fast shipping
B0034L1JXE|1|Mounting holes did not match and it would not correctly fit the bumper face!! Bad product! Thinking of getting a refund on this product
B000CRCQK8|1|Plain and simple do not buy it, was the worst product I have ever bought in AMAZON.  Poor workmanship and construction dont trust your life with these rails.
B00EKRKZB8|5|Love the way these look on my 2014 Charger R/T.  Very easy to install if you remove each wheel first.  They provide enough coverage to stop most rocks and debris kicked up by factory width tires from damaging your paint.
B0084545NG|5|Just what I was looking for and,fast service also!!!!
B00KMZI2JE|4|like it dose the job and clean the brush
B003MWJ6SA|5|Heavy duty, perfect crimp every time
B000GZJ320|5|these refills were very affordable. have used this product for years.
B001M0UQO2|5|Really  dresses up the gap between the exhaust tips. but hard to get on without jacking up the vehicle and a lot of jiggling
B006GVH61I|5|Looks great on my 2015 Siena SE. Very easy to install.
B0000AXC24|1|get the blue-point gauge off the snap on truck. it may be twice the price but it will save you so much time working with a quality product.<br /><br />This Tire inflator is of very poor quality. buyer beware
B005HTFQI0|5|Good helmet, great price and fast shipping to Canada!
B001C9IQJU|4|I bought this pair for a '96 Land Rover Discovery (SD-5sp)with 93,000 miles. The OEMs were work and leaking and the KYBs are and OEM replacement. I put a set of GR-2's in my Land Cruiser and we are very pleased (Wife's Daily Driver) The set for the Disco seem to provide more of a harsh, off-road, don't forget this is a truck sort of ride. Not bad mind you and better to have too firm than too soft when needed. The truck handles well again and is much more stable which is great. Freeway miles are fine but it is noticeable (because new?) on some local roads in need of repair...    On teh bench, they are the same extended length as OEM but feel more \\"stout\\". I'm pleaed with the purchase and the price point. It would be cheaper to have Sears order and install, and maybe the right way to go for a truck with 93k, but this guy has served us well since new and deserves a little better that Monroes...  Tom
B00BB15BK6|4|Fits perfectly but needs a cut out for trunk and gas cap release, I had to do it myself. Other than that I'm satisfied
B0082FUKEQ|5|Great product, easy intallation, slid right on my Harley and looks sharp. Very good crome for the price and would definitely buy again.
B000Q0TY4C|5|feels great, fit my 645ci great. very comforting and smooth. car looks more aggressive and stable in hard turns.no need to modify anything, it fits perfectly fine.
B00ELQQF6M|5|It put the Bling to my Machine.
B000BQSXC0|1|Piece of junk leaked and it's almost impossible to get the nozzle off without letting out all of the air it took you and hour to pump in because the thing sucks
B00DQF9BNI|5|Great sticker.
B0016SRAHQ|4|A- B+
B002IA43V2|5|I put this light on my 1995 Vulcan. The oem light was small and not very bright. I always kept it on high beam. This light is much brighter and looks kool at the same time. Install was easy. I wish I had known how easy it would be or I would have done this 3 years ago when I bought the bike. You will need to figure out the wires since there are no instructions and no bolts. The price is right and I couldn't be more happy. I couldn't imagine why anyone would \\"rip out\\" the bulb.
B00PXO85DW|5|This is the best product around.  I bought one for me and one for my daughter for both our trucks.  It is sturdy and we just love it.  Shipped fast, seller is great.  Thanks.
B004X24DUY|5|Great quality
B000CPAEJA|5|I use this exclusively on my Ferrari. I have used it on wheel bearings, CV joints, and anywhere else grease can go. I have never had any problem with it other than a bit leaking out the bottom of my grease gun which is not unusual for any grease. I would highly suggest it to any who want a high temp, high pressure grease! If I trust it on my Ferrari you can trust it on any vehicle you care about....<br /><br />Rob
B00FS1PQPU|4|THE SECONDARY (HIGH VOLTAGE) CONTACT WAS OFF CENTER BUT WAS STILL ABLE TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE DISTRIBUTOR CAP CONTACT.  OTHERWISE IT IS WORKING FINE.
B005CLP9NU|5|Delivered within the time frame. Fits perfectly.
B001656DWM|2|These brake lines worked (but almost didn't) the length is barely long enough and there is a 90 degree bend in one of the lines. Also I ordered red and black but got grey lines.
B000C5YCZ2|5|Could not beat the pricing of this OEM ox sensor and almost would say it's affordable, although I think all car manufacturers oxygen sensors are way overpriced
B002ZTGMZG|5|I have the whole set for my car and all i can say is, thank you for making this product.<br />It fits my car like a glove and easy to clean.
B007RVR3D2|2|Looks like they work, but they will NOT work on a 2005-2009 outback.  Need to write seven more wo rds.
B000CBLWDG|5|Excellent high quality plug wires.
B0042VVJGW|4|Very good alarm but it comes only with one remote no one for spare.
B000JFHMVQ|5|Showed up quick and good for large trucks and equipment.  A lid would be nice, but this is easy to pour back into other containers.
B003K0YDPU|5|ORDER THIS STARTER BECAUSE MY CAR WOULDNT START ONCE ENGINE GOT HOT.....THIS STARTER IS WAY SMALLER THEN THE FACTORY ONE I HAD AND IS WAY MORE POWER STARTS MY HIGH PERFORMANCE ENGINE WITHOUT A SINGLE PROBLEM...AND ITS VERY QUITE LIKE A 2011 CAR STARTER YOU DONT HEAR A THING WHEN YOU HIT THE KEY..THE CAR JUST STARS....    THIS IS A VERY STRONG STARTER HAD FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.....I WILL DO BUSSNESS WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN..THANK YOU
B003BZD03K|5|Convenient.
B003FKFX68|1|Came apart on first cruise. CFR Performance? More like P.O.S. performance.
B00390BS7C|5|Exactly what I wanted. Made install much easier!
B003FBV8ZW|5|Great value.  The product arrived as estimated.  This is the second set I bought.
B000BUOSGG|5|Fits perfectly in our RV sink.
B000XQM1JO|5|Love it
B002EOVDII|5|OK.  So we all know that the iPhone batteries don't last all day if you actually use the phone and any apps during the day.  That's what makes a car charger a necessity for the on-the-go professional.  This car charger was super cheap, and it has worked well so far.  I've had it for about a month now and have had no problems.  I've tried to be careful about unplugging it and not starting the car with it and the phone plugged in based on other reviews I've read.  It does feel a little cheap, but as long as it works, it's all good!<br /><br />3/14/13 - Update - I have now owned this product for 2.5 years, and it has been fabulous!  I travel frequently during the day as a salesperson, and I am using the iPhone most of the day.  The charger is indispensable and has worked like a charm!
B005H28X46|5|it is what it is and everything is sealed and ready to rock very excited about using new oil i have high hopes so far ...so good
B009IZIU8C|5|EXCELLENT
B0009YIE1O|5|Used it to attach a 17.5 old school Winnebago wheel to the back of the motorhome.  Cheaper than having one fabricated and all I need to do in order to use my hitch is get another receiver welded to the top of either bumper to relocate the spare tire.  It is sort of an odd angle but hasn't been a problem.  Angle may actually help airflow to radiation on the front.  It does not come with hardware but 15 minutes at the hardware store to get some carriage bolts (1/2&#34; x 3 I think), washers, etc. and I was all set.  There's enough play to get all 3 bolts through a old dually motorhome wheel.
B004PX4YDM|4|for the price it will work
B002D3KR4Q|5|Easy to put on yourself. Just use blue painters tape to mark where you want it then go for it.<br /><br />And way more durable than the clear film protector version which should NOT be installed by an owner. Just installed by Toyota Parts Dept. which has done before because the film is tricky
B005F7IYJ2|5|These are perfect for my 7 year old son. They seem durable, he wears them while on his dirt bike
B009E9J1Y4|5|Excellent service, great product!!
B000CIQ4VE|1|One month under sun, broken.
B001O0BJUK|5|Works perfect for my 99 F150 with 214,000 miles runs like new
B004W1L4M6|5|The sensor I paid $140 bucks for two years ago from a big-name parts house failed again.  I read numerous reviews on these, from the cheap ones to the over $100 name brands.  Decided to try this middle of the road one.  Put it in my '99 Accord myself (after a trip to Sears for the right size socket), disconnected the negative battery cable for a few minutes to clear the code and monitors and, \\"ta da\\" no more check engine light issue.  I've driven the car now for three days to reset the monitors and the light is still off.  I'm taking it to get the smog certificate tomorrow - I will update this post if there are any problems with smog or if the light comes back on in the next year or so.  Until then.... so far so good.<br /><br />Update: The car passed smog no problem.  :)
B0041PYGGO|5|This was a perfect replacement for running light on my Road King. Bulb was slightly smaller in diameter than stock but installed fine.
B00LU3C8DI|5|Works as exspected. My new toyota hzj 76 engine runs like it is already warm . O you know what i mean. Very good  additive but ceratec  is the best
B000BQYH6Q|5|Nothing heavy duty, but can't beat the price! They nest together and will work with my small RV perfectly.  asdf
B001BW8DD2|3|I purchased this for a 1998 Tracker boat, as it seemed to fit profile of the existing receptacle.  Heed the warning on other websites- just because this looks exactly like the receptacle you are trying to match it with, doesn't mean that it actually mates the same wires together.  I was going from a 4 wire setup (12/24 w/ two grounds) and supposedly the plug internally completes the 24 volt circuit by combining the two grounds and the two 12 volt wires. It even looked like the correct wires lined up when connected.  However, it seems to combine the ground with a positive internally, as I kept blowing fuses when switching to 24 volts.<br />This isn't the plug's fault, it was my existing receptacle.  Solution?  Buy a matched pair.
B0068MKONM|5|GOOD !
B002DP9W22|5|VERY EASY TO INSTALL.
B001AJH1HK|3|These DO NOT FIT my Honda Odyssey mirrors - it seems that my mirrors are aerodynamically angled and these mirrors are meant ONLY for mirrors that are square/flat on the back. The mirrors seem to be made of quality material, well manufactured and would probably last a long time. The new ratcheting system is easy to use and appears to be well designed. I would recommend these highly and would have rated them excellent if only they would fit. Buy these ONLY if you mirrors are not like mine.
B0024ECCJW|5|Great product. Easy installation. Will pay for itself in no time.
B00LXAMVOE|4|Perfect fit. Let's see how long it will last.
B000ELP6GS|5|So far it is good to go. Strong starter. Replacing what might have been the original starter on my Cherokee. 2 year warranty so I will keep this updated.
B00LF7L69Q|3|Good product but I thought it would offer better results- It is possible multiple applications to the same chip might look better over time. It is just not as quick as they advertise if so..
B004ZIWYI4|5|This was a terrific addition for my Honda CRF250L. It is steel so it should last. With this lower gearing the Honda is much more responsive, and I can go slow when needed. I didn't change the front sprocket, but could if I wanted to gear down a bit more.
B00GE9Y5ZC|5|Easy install I like the product
B008OX00Q4|5|Assuming you get the right one for your car/truck, which I read that there was one or two of you that received the wrong one, it will fit like a glove! I have a 97 Dodge 3500 diesel, with the inexplicably, broken up dash.. Shame on you Dodge, so I bought this.<br /><br />There are a lot of nuances to my dash, more than normal. This cover is made perfectly. There is also expressed frustration over lack of Velcro, I had extra waiting for this, but did not need or use it. Follow directions folks, and you will be fine.<br /> I left the cover sitting out on my dash for about 6 hours in the sun/heat to allow the form of the cover to 'rest' into place. Then I cut the strips in 3/4&#34; pieces, not the 1/2&#34; that was instructed. Then put the cover on and noted where the most important edges are and moved along. Perfect fit. It also perfectly matches my Bone Collector seat covers! Didn't expect that.<br />I waited longer than originally predicted, but it was worth the wait. Thank you Dash Designs, thank you! Blessings
B00KLZ65GM|3|Not perfect and not bad
B000BQR100|3|It works ok. It does the job. But I found it hard to figure out how to make it stay on the dashboard and in place to block the sun without falling. Takes a minute each time.<br />Closing this thing up and twisting it properly is not intuitive. I  always fumble with it and its not an easy stash away to just put it away and go.<br />I would definitely try something else next time.
B000GZL29M|5|Have this hooked up to my KLR 650.  I'm not a big fan of the connectors that are used in these types of gadgets, as they can be tough to connect and I am always afraid I am going to break off the silver prongs.  This charger is great.  Light tells you when it is charging, then switches lights to let you know it is in &#34;storage&#34; mode and trickle charging.  The chord is nice and long to get from the wall socket to my MC.  After reading horror stories about a similar charger made by Battery Tender, I can say after a year I have had no problems with this charger overheating or failing to work.  My MC always fires up right away after being on the charger.  It is essential.  I have not had to tend a car battery with it and use the big clips, so can't comment on that....
B0023W1BA6|5|Fits well and is easy to install.
B001EA0LI6|5|This product works very fast and has adheasive inside that activates when its applied.  I may need a little tape to help around sharp edges to form it properly, but it goes on very straight and with little finess.  Great product.
B00K8PEJHW|5|Wow, awesome upgrade for the 2015 Jeep Rubicon.  Clean and clear light.  Very slight flicker.  Considering purchasing the anti-flicker kits (additional $75.00 for each light = $150.00).  You must be aware of this when moving to LED.  KC headlights include the kits.  There is no way these kits should cost this much and should not be an after thought.  They should be included with the lights like KC does with their headlights.
B000EVYHOU|3|3 stars because it didn't come with any fittings<br />nice looking tho
B0002SR7TC|5|This product works well.  The instructions and the manual are poor but the product is easy to use.  Other reviews have described how to make it work.  My tiny car (4 quarts of oil in engine) required more than 8 pumps and took longer than 5 minutes.    I suggest you buy this product given these conditions 1). You can change your oil filter without climbing under the car. 2). You live in a place (a nice apartment complex) where you cannot work on your car up without getting the evil eye OR 3). You drain oil from a number of cars and don't care to jack up 6 cars every few months.    If you only have one or two cars and you have a place to change your oil I wouldn't buy it.  However, now that I have it I'm keeping it.  But if I had the chance to try it before I used it I would have just stuck to the old fashioned way of spilling oil on the garage floor, my hands, my shirt, and my head.
B009TA35L8|3|I ordered these mat for my 2004 toyota matrix XRS 6speed. One piece rear mats, isn't really one piece but two; works and fits good btw. Passenger side mat fits good and snug!! Thumbs up*  Driver side mat could have been better, here are three area I noticed;<br />1: Big gap/opening space by the gas lever(I'm sure dirt will get trapped in there).<br />2: The right rear corner of the driver mat could have been brought up more or extended a bit more.<br />3: My vehicle being a manual trans with the 6speed, my clutch and foot would hit the corner of the mat.<br /><br />But all and all for the price and what is it, I am happy with the product and it will work fine for me. :D I hope this will help you guys who is researching before buying. :D
B00068XCQU|5|I have only used it once but an electrician with 40+ years of experience recommended this to me.  It does not overcharge the battery and is as safe as it gets.  Remember do not charge batteries inside because there is a gas that is released.  Always do it outside.
B000HBNX38|4|First time using this treatment and was very happy with the results. Easy to apply per the directions. This saved the 1/4&#34; thick iron plate that had been rusting. Permatex formed a black coated surface that I could paint.
B005I3522K|2|K&N name, K&N price, but the finish quality was poor.  When the intake pipe was coated it was obviously left on one end and the result was a large build up of over spray, had to machine and refinish. In hind sight should have sent back.<br /><br />By itself, you won't see any gains with this on a Cruze ECO Turbo (or any car/truck), you'll get an unmuffled turbo sound and BOV.  If you really want some HP, this needs to be installed in combination with a proper tune.  I'd highly recommend VTTuners, they specialize in GM turbos and the process is super easy and quick.  After a proper tune with this item on 93, 170bhp is achievable.
B00DBFO35Y|5|good
B000E4PNC2|5|The price was very reasonable and the service was great. I didn't have any problems at all with the order. It also came in very quick and in perfect condition, also the packing was perfect for this particular product to say it was a mirror and that it was coming overseas. I would recommend Amazon to anybody if their looking to purcahse a mirror that not only was a good price but also a perfect fit for my car.
B001CEG90I|4|Worth getting and installation in 5 minutes. So much cheaper then having installed by service dept .........I highly recommend getting
B0024NWYZU|5|everything turned out great and look great.. had vw garage install to be sure everything was replaced correctly, especially beam<br />levels etc.,  thanks
B0076AUCKU|5|The antenna was exactly as the original one which finally has deteriorated after 13 years in use. This one fit perfectly.
B00062Z4J4|2|Once installed the product is great.  Installation is the issue.  I'm lucky enough to have a thread set, and 1/2-20 is what you need to clean up the internal threads.  They're some of the worst I've ever seen on a product.  Really let down with Hurst on this, the shifter it's installed on is amazing but this does not live up to their name.
B004GCLECG|5|Fit my 97' Toyota perfect
B007PP26RI|5|Developed a hole in the muffler of my John Deere 425.  This product solved the problem.  You cut a portion off the roll, knead it in your hands, and apply the putty like product to fill the hole in the muffler. It helps to clean and sandpaper the area you intend to repair.  The repair is subject intense heat, but it holds very well.  Highly recommended!
B00Y1HUJYK|5|These work great. I took them to the local hardware for cutting. They did not charge but warned that if they did not work, the hardware was not liable. They work perfectly!
B00HGNUG7G|5|the tank protector was well worth the money.its thick not skinny like some ive seen.the carbon fiber look and honda decal are awesome.great product !!
B00NGOSBQC|5|Excellent...
B00339NAAC|4|These spark plugs are not \\"Platinum\\" or \\"Iridium\\" or \\"Unobtainium\\".  They are spark plugs.  And they work.....good.  And they're not expensive....even better.  Many members of the Miata.net forum say these are the best spark plugs for the Miata.  They're working well for me!
B00HG2UEBA|4|It works as showed does a great job.
B002ZBPXGS|2|I have a Lexus IS250 with decent leather. Its a few years old and has real leather and not the pleather of the new body style. This is my wife's car and she wears jeans and black dress pants. The leather is tan and her pants have started staining the leather on the driver seat. I usually just try cleaning the seats with a damp rag as recommended in the owners manual. I have also tried mild detergent. While the methods used have helped they cannot get rid of the bluing on the drivers seat. I purchased this Lexol kit in hopes that it would remove the staining. This kit has produced no noticeable difference in the look of my leather. The sponge that came with it did get a little dirty after cleaning but that is about it. So it didn't work for the bluing and it didn't even really clean my seats. Also, the conditioner has a warning not to use the product on soft leather... head this warning! I used it on my seats and it made them supper soft and not in a good way. The leather was already soft. I tried it because I figured the cleaner didn't really work so the conditioner probably wouldn't do much either. The conditioner does work. My leather did regain its form after a few days but it made me nervous on the driver's seat where the seat gets the folds from getting in and out. It was so soft I thought it would tear. I also bought this kit for the UV protectant as this is the only brand that I have found. So 1 star for cleaner, 3 star for conditioner (it doesn't last very long.... thankfully) and the jury is out on the UV protectant (default 3 star) = 2.3 star rating
B005FCFE7C|5|Awesome sticker
B0031GSE1C|5|Great part.  No issues when installing.
B006LO67GA|1|I put battery in the motorcycle, double checked everything and I went for a ride.  The battery left me stranded on a highway.  Had to call for a tow truck.  Took bike to Kawasaki shop.  The battery was dead, ineffective, essentially junk.  Replaced with new Kawasaki battery ( I installed again ).  I paid $80.00 for tow truck and another $80.00 for a new Kawasaki battery.  Lost five hours of my time.  The YTX14-BS was junk.<br />Chuck Hankins
B009E9J112|5|Good
B00EBQL2SS|5|Nice, clean design. Good quality.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Great Product!
B000JFL7RG|5|Inexpensive way to check before replacing anti freeze
B00AX03E2I|5|These look cool
B003BZD03K|5|This elbow was a lifesaver.  Washer sizes have expanded over the last twenty years so our new LG washer was a tight fit in the old space.  This elbow saved two inches of depth and prevents the hose from rubbing on the wall, possibly causing a hose break and water damage.
B000XQ9MGE|5|I've only had this for about 3 weeks and have had no battery problems myself.  But with the severe cold winter we've had I figured it couldn't hurt to have something like this to avoid the hassle of finding another person and aligning cars to get jumper cables attached.  I told a friend of mine that I bought this and sure enough, two weeks after I got it, he asked me at work if I had it with me.  I did, and in about 10 degree weather I took it out, walked over to his car, hooked up the cables on the charger unit to his battery (I did put both on his battery, not the black/ground on some piece of metal) and he turned his key and his car started no problem.  Not even the slightest hesitation or engine turnover, started better than it probably does off his own battery when good.<br /><br />So my first use of this was a great success.  Some other nice things: It has a button you can press to see the charge level (1, 2, or 3 green lights) and when I got it all 3 lights would light up so it apparently came fully, or nearly fully, charged.  I plugged in the power cord for a couple hours just to be safe.  By the time I used it with my friend's car it had been in my car (very cold weather) for a couple weeks.<br /><br />All in all I'd have to say this did exactly what I wanted and was very reasonably priced (I got it for $64 at Amazon...it had been marked down to about $54 for a couple weeks while I kept my eye on it...should have bought it then!).<br /><br />FYI, it comes with a 1-time repair/replace card that I guess you could use to send in the product if it fails (within a year? can't remember time frame) for a repair or replace but it will cost you $60!!  I think this includes the shipping that they will pay, but either way you could simply buy another unit for around $60 and avoid the hassle of mailing the thing.  So this repair/replace &#34;benefit&#34; seems pretty useless though that's hardly why I bought it.
B002EX98KY|2|This vaporizer does not work well at altitudes above 1600m (1 mile) because the butane and piezoelectrics don't work well at these altitudes. I live in Colorado and it will not work all the time in Fort Collins. It definitely doesn't work if I want to go skiing in the mountains. If you're at high altitudes reconsider buying this product. Otherwise it seems like a really solid device, just use the recommended fuels - not cheap butane!
B000KITSMI|5|Worked exactly as described.  Replaced a leaking valve core on my 2001 Honda Accord LX with no problem.  Very easy to use.
B003AHEPU6|5|I got this for my son because he loves Snoopy. It was easy to put on the window. It is easy to find his SUV in a parking lot, how many people have Snoopy on their back window.
B001MOVJJE|4|I initially ordered the wrong power window switch.  Switch Doctor was very good about exchanging the switch and making sure that I got the right one.  The installation for fairly straight forward, even though it was something I have never done before.  Very pleased with the product and the customer service.
B00J3ZNBQI|5|GREAT - VERY STURDY!!
B000SW4J16|5|Ha sido una muy buena compra, recomiendo el uso de las luces HID, sobre todo en los faros auxiliares que muestran mejor el camino, estoy muy contento con mis luces HID y esta marca es muy buena.
B00AX47FLA|3|When it works, this device is great. But, this device cuts out frequently. It's not clear whether the weak point is with the plugs, headsets, or switches, but fussing with the volume switch seems to help. Nonetheless, it should not be this way from the very first time I used it.<br /><br />Other than being intermittent, the volume is great.
B00R3LYF7S|5|This was given as a gift to friends, as I was looking for something useful to fill with homemade goodies.  This worked perfectly, and my friends were very pleased with the organizer.  It was of very good quality, folds flat and is easily opened for use. Shipping was fast and it came when promised.
B0048EDHTK|1|The DashMat was nice but it would have been much better if it was made for my vehicle. They got it wrong!! And didn't even come close, Then there was the problem of returning it because none of the questions included being sent the wrong item and every other answer ment paying for return shiping. I ended up putting down that it didn't match there description. I was going to order another one but was afraid they would send me the wrong one again. The number on the package was right with the wrong item inside.
B000WK6V8I|5|I have a Can-Am Spyder so it has LOTS of surface to clean including &#34;tupperware&#34;, the windshield, chrome and my helmet visor.  This spray is safe on all of those and polishes quickly and easily to streak free shines with out an dull spots or overspray.  The bugs may need a little extra elbow grease but that's understandable.  This ammonia free cleaner is safe to use on windshields and visors.<br /><br />This is the same stuff as the honda detailer and harley detailer.
B00N0HQXHO|5|Great replacement for my 2014 Jeep Wrangler JKU. I've been using FRAM for as long as I've been driving and changing my oil. Never an issue.<br /><br />This includes the filter and sealing o-ring for the filter cap.
B008535CTS|5|This think is perfect.  It works and installs with no problem.  Looks fantastic for the price.  Can not be beat!
B000GTTYU2|1|Looking at the picture that is supplied, I thought I was ordering a bracket to hold a 2.5 gal. gas can.  The part I received is a little flat piece of metal that holds the gas can bracket. The picture does not represent what is being sold.
B0052FRXNA|5|Fits great
B0089EMIM2|5|The brakes came quick and fit perfectly and so far they are doing great! I've been out riding through the mountains and feel very comfortable with these pads
B004D5Q3F4|5|It fits right and does what it is supposed to do.  Good price.
B00K85FI3G|1|Very poor quality
B0045GULCM|1|&#34;2011 Jeep wrangler&#34; Had them for a few months or so by now. As the description says, they have a break in coating on them to help set in the pads. Light braking for the first 250 miles & the a few hard braking from there & you're set. Just be on a safe road area where you could do the hard braking. Pads are an exact fitment and they are for the rear.  I didn't replace my rotors cause they are still good, but I do have brake squeal often. But it's nothing to worry about. It's not the pads fault. Pads are a nice yellow colour that pops out if you want that eye catching look.  They do produce allot of bake dust, unfortunately. My rear rims are cover in it. Pads are still thick though. Not sure how long they'll last. It all depends on how the person drives. But I'm hoping for more than 40k.  UPDATE: November 14,2015 I rechecked my brakes to see how well these are doing.  And at just over 9k on them they are down to 3mm. Now that is to much pad being wormed out in a short time. Rims are nice and coated from the pads dust.  Was really hopeful these would last longer and perform a lot better than stock. Been wanting to try them for many years and when I finally do, they under performed.   Star rating dropped from 3 to 1
B00ASBYYHQ|5|HAVE NOT INSTALLED THEM YET, WAITING FOR IT TO WARM UP A BIT BEFORE I TACKLE THIS PROJECT. I WILL UPDATE LATER.
B005OZNRVK|4|Had the key cut and then programmed it and voila - a new working key. You can see the where the chip is installed - not a problem - just not like originals.
B00F8KP9SA|4|Does the trick, but still didn't have the exact adapter for my Volvo's rear brakes. I got it to work anyways with some improvising.
B004SIBQJO|5|Looks and performs as a great manufacturer replacement. Install took less then ten minutes.
B002PQW4SI|5|yes there perfect,just like originals
B00FPW848S|5|As a major MJ fan, this was a must for me and my keys and the price was right. Not only did it arrive in the blink of an eye, but it looks even better in person than the picture. I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my daughter and we both just love them. So glad I found these. Awesome addiction to my huge collection of MJ items. You won't regret this purchase, I promise. Also makes a great gift for any MJ lover of all ages!!
B000EQR990|5|This is a great product. Has special coating on filter to prevent mold from developing on it. Keeps in car air clean and prevents it from smelling bad.
B000CPCBWS|3|I cannot rate this hitch.  It was sent to me by mistake as I needed model 44546 for my vehicle.  It appears to be well built and should bolt on to the correct vehicle with only four bolts.
B008INWF0O|5|I have gone through a can of this stuff so far and I don't think I'll ever use anything else for cleaning my bike.  Cleans paint,chrome, and headlight glass easily.  I don't have a windshield on my bike so I can't say how it handles that but I use it on just about every other surface of my bike except for my seat and tires.  Spray it on, wipe it off.  Easy as that.  A lot easier than chrome polish and easier to work with in an aerosol can.  I would definitely recommend this to others.
B0050SYD28|5|Super easy to install only 2000 tundra. I recommend taking the 2 bottom screws out of the glove box and taking the glove box off so that it's easier to take the top screw out of the resistor. From start to finish the job took less than 5 min. Works perfect and now I can use other a/c settings other than Hi and Off. In the pics I showed where the resistor is located and what the old one looks like and what the new one looks like.
B007NIYA4Y|5|A++++
B00162EKFM|4|I wasn't paying attention and didn't realize cars have more than 1 air filter.  I thought this was what I refer to as the air filter of a car, but it's the air filter for the cabin air (as stated in the name), not the engine.  At first I thought this was the wrong size since it was too short and wide to fit into my air filter box.  I looked at the directions and it fit into that spot just fine.  The website on the box doesn't go anywhere so if you lose your instructions you can't just follow the box to find more.  Because of the dead link I take off 1 star.    My own fault and I needed to replace this filter as well.
B008U1MOM8|2|I guess I'm the other 50%.  I bought another generic one for $17 a few weeks ago and it works great.<br /><br />This one came in the same electrostatic protective sleeve and not the nice box in the video review.<br /><br />I got this one from BrainyDeals and it can pair but doesn't work.  Had to return it.  I guess I'll buy another one from the other dealer I purchased a few weeks ago.<br /><br />I gave it 2 starts because it is Prime and Amazon didn't argue about returning it...otherwise it would be 1 star.
B000AM8BN6|5|Installed this on my 2009 Suzuki Boulevard C50 and it fits and works great. After I installed this bulb, my riding partners decided to put me in front because the light was so bright. You may have to adjust your headlight height a little after install to optimize all of this new light.
B00JGJH8QU|5|Cheaper than the full surge protectors, and seems adequate for our travel trailer needs.  Used it on our first trip and it showed that our hookup was properly wired.
B00HSW777M|4|A lot smaller than I realized ..
B009DJSRV8|4|part arrived as described. and it arrived at the time it was said to be delivered. the part is as described have not installed but repair guy said it was right part.
B000ETXX2O|5|Penzoil is rated one of the best Synthetic motor oils.<br />I got the 6pack for subscribe and save for every 4 months so I can remember to change my oil.<br /><br />Good price!
B002VRU352|2|I have a touch pro and this product wasn't compatible. I emailed the seller to inform them of the problem. They assured me that they have sold a dozen of these for the Touch Pro and no one has ever reported a problem but they were willing to exchange it for a universal at no additional cost. I thought this was great so I replied accepting their offer but I have yet to hear anything back from them. If the cradle would have worked I would have given a higher review if they would have made contact with me sooner to finalize the replacement I would have given a higher review. At this point I am still waiting for them to follow up with me.
B00KVWQJM0|5|Very nice upgrade to regular bulbs. Would purchase again
B00UK5HL0M|3|nice product
B005KQUMHK|2|The material is high quality, and it is quite easy to install.  However unless you are a very small person this will not deflect wind appropriately.  This sends the wind right into my face and shoulders and it is much to small to do any good on my motorcycle.  What is even worse is the seller &#34;Phat Performance Parts&#34; will not accept the windshield back because it was &#34;already installed&#34;.  Give me a break.  Don't waste your time, get a larger windshield unless you sit very low on your bike.
B002RSIK4G|5|Love this stuff!!
B00INYPPD2|5|Bought this for my sons Polaris 800s Razor. Fits real good and wasn't really that hard to put on. There weren't any illustrated instructions that came with it, but if you're just half-way knowledgeable with the Razor type roof,  you should be able to figure it out pretty well. Looks great on the ride and adds some bling as well protection from the elements.
B0066SMJL8|5|Worked perfect:)
B00SC9629Y|5|I'm really happy with this product the quality is good also fits perfect and has good value. I'm highly recomended this product to everyone ☺
B00COOSF98|5|I had purchased 2 kits prior to yours and had to return one for being defective. I received yours in the mail today and was blown away! The instruction for one thing are a great help since I didn't get that with my other brand and the various install harness options included. The mounting brackets are fantastic and made my install look professional and to also mention how beautiful the ballast modules look. I did need to utilize the extension wires for the H11 bulb, thanks for including... The install was a complete success. My wife can't wait for it to get dark, she wants to go for a spin..
B0060N7TQO|5|Just what I needed.
B002P8QSAG|5|Worked exactly as it should, easiest car damage fix I've ever done.
B001ATBEK0|5|Best all purpose cleaner I have ever used and have been using it for over 20 years.  We use it on almost everything from laundry to car engines.
B00BJGVU4O|4|I purchased these for all of the reasons that this device will perform. All of the below comments are with me wearing an Arai full face helmet, and my buddy, and wife both have modular Nolan helmets. My bike: 2013 KLR650 with stock exhaust.<br />  When I have used this for bike to bike communications it was nearly flawless. When riding with a pal it rarely ever went out of range.  The range is completely dependent upon the terrain.  While in the twisty roads in the mountains it will disconnect at about 0.2-0.4 miles when you round a mountain pass, but it reconnects when you get closer to each other automatically. However on straight, flat roads it worked decent at nearly a mile apart.  The overall sound quality is better than expected as a whole, however at higher speeds with the right winds it can be challenging to understand each other.  Typically it was fine below 60 MPH, but frequently had difficulties once around 70 MPH or higher with cross winds.  Not enough that it is unusable, just a noticeable big difference from how clear the headsets are under 60 MPH. The quality of the helmet plays into how good this system works.<br /> My wife, and I use these when riding two up. For this purpose I am less impressed. Even with two full face helmets you tend to get feedback from the sets.  I suspect this is because both headsets are \\"listening\\" to the same sounds of the bike you are on.  When no one is speaking the headsets self-mute until you start speaking again. When riding two up the acceleration from a stop and louder engine noise causes the headsets to pick up the bike noises until back at a steady lower RPM. Again not terrible, just not as good as bike to bike use.<br /> Cell phone use is about the same as bike to bike quality both as the rider, and the person on the other end of the phone. For music purposes this works very well.  No issues at all.<br /> When I used this as bike to bike communications we have had 10 hour days with heavy communication, and music use and have yet to deplete the batteries.  So far exceeding what they advertised.<br /> Overall very please with the headsets, and now my buddy is going to buy one for his use after borrowing mine.se and have yet to deplete the batteries.  So far exceeding what they advertised.<br /> Overall very please with the headsets, and now my buddy is going to buy one for his use after borrowing mine.
B004XE5L58|5|What is there to say?! I love it, looks great on my car, glad I bought it. YAY lol wee
B000K8GKS8|5|This plate is lovely and  durable at the same time. The colors are rich, and so far has held up perfectly to the elements. Nice addition to personalize your vehicle.
B00KTJ7IGQ|1|No! It said it came with free program instructions. When I got it the instructions were to call a dealership or locksmith. I did and was $75 a fob.
B00CASDZKC|5|These were worth every penny. I have a new 2010 Explorer with leather seats which were falling pray to two sets of little feet in the back. I bought these and they fit great, look great and protect my leather!! :)
B001N1E9Y8|5|Tcp gets 5 stars. This set gets 2. Theses are decent guns especially for the price. Only  problem is  behind the  air diffuser inside the  body of the gun is anodizing color. When you  clean the gun this will bleed into  the solvent. If you  use white or clear it can cause  a issue. If you  clean the color off it should be fine. If you  use white and clear alot I would get the ones that are chrome.
B00080QHMM|5|Very accurate and easy to use tire pressure gauge. Works in all temperatures too. I would highly recommend this tire pressure gauge .
B000UNLVKU|5|You don't need to move your car, once I learnt how to install, it only took me 3 minutes to get both done, you better wear clean glove though, it's a dirty job
B004VR08IW|5|great product all ok looks great
B00ESVR16S|5|Makes the car look cool!
B00I8OG35G|5|Arrived quickly fit perfectly priced competitively
B000H0RDB2|5|Great product, surpassed what I thought they would be like. AAAA+++. fast response by seller. very happy dealing with this seller and this product.
B000GTUCZS|5|works like a charm!
B006LGKGX8|2|Garbage! dont waste your money.The only good thing about this product is that it came fast.The &#34;2 Left sided mirrors&#34; they call &#34;a set&#34; are made of plastic & you will have to reverse one mirror on the stem & it wont fit right so you'll have to &#34;rigg&#34;it & forget about actually useing it to see behind you because its still the leftsidded shape & wont adjust properly on the right side.(INVEST IN LOCKTIGHT! you're gonna need it to keep these things from spinning around on ya when you're rideing The stems are made of cheap chrome(ish) metal that will split on you soon as you tighten em up on your handlebar mounts.Heres the kicker.Not only are they 2 left sided,cheap plastic & tin mirrors.THEY DIDNT EVEN SEND THE STYLE I ORDERED! (They sent me the ones with the flame stems) I needed mirrors on my bike so i put em on so i dont get pulled over but as soon as i can,I'll get better ones on there & throw these where they belong
B00KTIMIFS|1|Item worked great for about two months and then stopped working, now I have to go through the dealer to purchase another one.
B0012TUREC|4|Handy lil tool,used it to tune the carbs on 95cbr900,fit really good in the cramped, awkward location of pilot screw
B00AB2IHNO|4|Fitment was fine and it does the job.  The only thing about it that I don't like is that the handle itself seems to be shaped SLIGHTLY different than the original one that came on the van.  The original handle has more of a &#34;lip&#34; on the back edge where your fingers go.  So, when you grab the handle and pull on it to open the door, your fingers slip off as the handle pivots towards you, which snaps the handle back to its original position.  The door still unlatches, it just makes me wonder how much of this that the handle will be able to tolerate over time before it breaks.<br /><br />It's a shame this was designed that you have to replace this ENTIRE license plate holder just because the handle broke, but it is what it is.
B007SQUQFS|5|we have 2 pitbulls. this sticker is sweet. it will go nice on our highlander rear window. we love it.
B000IG5PZQ|3|I wanted to write a review here simply because neither Amazon nor the manufacturer listed the dimensions of this clock, and I wasn't able to determine how big the clock was before I purchased it.  It turned out to be a bit smaller than I was hoping, and I wanted others to be able to find this information without having to make the purchase.<br /><br />The clock is nearly 3-1/2 inches wide, 1-7/8 inches high, and about 3/8th of an inch thick.  The numbers themselves are just over 3/4th of an inch high by 3/8th of an inch wide.<br /><br />With that out of the way, the only other comments are these:<br /><br />- The clock has no back lighting, so cannot be read in the dark, or easily read in low light.  (This is just what I wanted, since it was going next to a flat screen TV, and a bright clock would be distracting while we are watching movies).<br /><br />- It has a plastic, fold-out stand, but of course the clock must be angled somewhat upward if this is used.  Since I was placing it on a shelf above eye-level, I extended the length of the stand by taping a piece of black plastic to it.  This allowed me to place the clock on the shelf, while keeping the face of it vertical, making it easily seen from the sofa.<br /><br />- It also comes with two double-sided adhesive pads so it could be adhered to a wall or car dashboard.  I opted not to use this.<br /><br />- It is easy to set both the time and date, but the date is only displayed if the Mode button is pressed.  It has no alarm or timer features.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's fine for what it is, and at a reasonable price (if it holds up for a while).
B006P5IV0K|5|Shift knob is really nice, and hold up to wear and tear really well, which is nice, because if the paint on the gear indicators wore off t would look like garbage. If you don't want to spend a lot, but want a nice know, go with this.
B000C59M98|5|Gave my car such a better ride
B00J5AAX5S|5|Nice heavy excellent  quality  for the can't go wrong with these. I will order again
B006XYBFKQ|5|Works to expectations and very satisfied.<br />Product is made well and fit according to description.<br />I will order another for a different car.
B008J20R1S|5|I actually couldn't find this color anywhere local, so I purchased it online. I really liked the gun metal color from the plastidip, and it's easy to put on with very little prep work.
B004YEIRAI|5|Don't know if it will scare away any Zombies but it looks authentic.
B003977OZK|5|this is a great product not only can you spray at any angle but you get more even coverage and they are cheap.
B007CDYWSE|2|Average quality
B000KK0DNY|1|When received, the box was severely damaged and taped as if it had been previously shipped several times elsewhere. The FedEx driver, a next door business owner, and the body shop owner saw the box and drew the same conclusion I had. The shipping box utilized was below the minimum crash standards for UPS and probably for FedEx. The vendor listing on Amazon had a pop up window to confirm the fit. I checked it and confirmed it would fit a 1999 GMC 1500 Sierra Classic 3 door contrary to the vendors allegations; however, according to the body shop I employed to install it stated it was 2 \\" too long and had wrong mounting brackets. This cost me $40.00 for them to determine it would not work without drilling new holes in the bracket and frame. Amazon was contacted to return. After several days the vendor finally sent a FedEx Ground label to return. Although the purchase price was $165.00 for apparently falsely advertised product and/or failing to ship the correct item and failing to appropriately package for shipping.  If it was damaged, as he contends, it occurred in shipping for it was returned in the same condition as received and same packaging initially used. The body shop put them back in the box and sealed it. I never saw these bars.
B0027U3X5A|4|LE QUEDARON MUY BIEN A MI TOYOTA CAMRY 1992, LE PUSE CUATRO ESTRELLAS PORQUE NO BENIAN EN LA CAJA ORIGUINAL Y NO PUDE RECLAMAR UN DESCUENTO DE PROVEEDOR.
B00EB7OY5A|5|Comfortable and very breathable.  Just be careful to keep away from any velcrow (kidney belt or gloves).  Great jersey.  I bought a size larger than usual for my son, and it was a good choice.  Bought with the matching gloves, and he loves the set.
B00SBZRKEU|5|Filled tank on my Husqvarna 54&#34; zero turn rider in less than a minute. The included fuel can adapters fit both sizes of gas cans I use. One is a 6 gallon and the other is a 5 gallon. According to the documentation that came with the pump, I should be able to empty 50 5 gallon cans before having to replace the 4 AA batteries. We'll see how that works out.
B0049AYZG2|5|I have a 2000 Civic EX and a while back it got to where it was running terribly.  In fact, it got so bad it would barely start.  I did some troubleshooting and decided that maybe my catalytic converter was stopped up.  This was confirmed when I removed the upstream O2 sensor and gave the exhaust an exit path through the sensor hole.  The car started and ran fine without the O2 sensor in there.  So I went to a local muffler place and told the knucklehead there that my converter was stopped up.  He began to argue/debate me and basically said that those things almost never go bad and my problem was elsewhere.  I told him I was damn sure it was the culprit and to put a new one on there for me.  He did, and afterward said I was right - it was stopped up nearly solid.  So I left and a day later my \\"check engine\\" light came on.  I had a mechanic I know pull the code and it was \\"emissions inefficiency\\" i.e the converter that the guy put on there wasn't getting the emissions numbers that the ECM wanted to see.  I looked under there and the size alone should have been an indication that it didn't have much catalyst compared to the OEM.  It was considerably smaller - plus it only cost about $160.  So I talked to a guy who works on imports exclusively and he basically said that was an inadequate converter.  He went on to say that the muffler shop guy was a moron and anybody who did that kind of work for a living should know better.  So I looked at getting a new OEM model from Honda and it was like $1100!  Needless to say, I started looking elsewhere.  I came across a converter made by Bosal but didn't know much about them.  I googled a few things and found a magazine interview with a gentleman by the name of Jeff Berman who is Bosal's Managing Director here in the US.  I thought it was worth a try to contact him directly and see if he could forward me to someone in Bosal tech support.  So I fired off an email and to my surprise, he replied himself shortly afterward with a lengthy and very detailed email answering all my questions and offering some great info about the Bosal converters and why he thought it would work for me.  After that I was sold and ordered it that evening.  Total price was cheap enough - about $260 and it arrived quickly.  I had it installed, lifted the battery ground to reset the ECM and clear the \\"check engine\\" light and it didn't come back on.  It's been three weeks and all's well.  The car is running great and NO \\"check engine\\" light.  I think this is a great product, period.  But the support of Mr. Berman made it all worthwhile.  I've never had anyone from a company in this day and age go out of their way to address an issue like he did for me.  If you need a catalytic converter, get a Bosal. It's reasonable and will get the emissions numbers your car's ECM wants to see.hy and very detailed email answering all my questions and offering some great info about the Bosal converters and why he thought it would work for me.

B006DJNCN4|5|The extra time waiting for the Episcopalian bumper stickers was made worth it when the package came with German postal markings ! The stickers are flawless and I really enjoyed them even more having been sent from Germany !
B00LEZEFNS|5|A+++
B009CLIRPS|1|I bought this product a couple of weeks ago after my previous 3 year old turn light starting failing, I have a suzuki XL7, the shape of the mirrors are similar to any SUV mirrors, first problem I encounter, the adhesive that the product has is a joke, so I changed it for outdoor 3M product, well I just discovered today that the panel that is inside of the plastic which holds the led lights started to break due to the shape of the mirror, it was not that I break it but I just install it the same way I installed the previous product I bought that lasted 3+ years, I guess this cheap product could not handle the shape of mi mirror plus receiving some sun. This is supposed to have a 6 month guarantee but I am not wasting more of my time and effort, this is not even worth a replacement. This is not the first time I buy stuff from China, but this product left me with a really bad experience. I guess you better buy something more expensive, they look good and bright but  I was able to use them for less than a week after they just broke, I do not think the plastic or the way they were constructed will last years due to sun and rain (they are not sealed and basically  they are exposed to water due to the way they are constructed. Please listen to me, stay away!!!! It is really I shame I cannot provide less than a star!
B004WQJOBY|5|Worked on 2003 Mercedes SL500.
B003E3O650|5|Fit great!
B00ELDVAW4|5|This product works great. I used them on my Volks Racing TE37. If your wheels have stickers do not use this product. It will remove them. Lucky I wanted to remove the stickers. In my case it all worked out.
B001GEN5MO|4|The car cover fits perfectly, a little difficult to get on and off, but what car cover does not
B000H6P55W|4|Spacious, easy to install and pack--did it myself in no time.  Straps were easy to fasten and tighten.  I was confident in the tightness of the straps, but the ends of the straps flap around noisily--I had to stop and kind of tie up the ends(there should be some kind of built in mechanism to account for this). I didn't notice much effect on miliage. All in all, very good product for the money.
B00CWD9XD8|5|Excellent quality!  Real nice product!<br /><br />And the comments and my responses make it a fun wear like, &#34;Do you own one?&#34; and my responce &#34;Yep, a 328GTS which I use on weekends when I work as a detective in Hawaii&#34;...  And there are more...  It's fun and brings a laugh which is a good thing.
B00HH3UY5O|5|Possible price $ 550  2pic
B00DMMU5QM|5|Shiny, great looking product that won't fade or rust because it's not made of metal! I really enjoy the look.
B00O7XYRQO|2|It came damaged...
B008G2B2H4|5|Perfect
B00NWF5JPG|5|works as advertised
B001LHVOVK|5|Worked perfectly and it's cheap cheap cheap.  Not sure what you'd gain from spending more.  Reads and resets OBDII codes.
B00AX29Q64|5|Will use again, very good people to work with.
B004TRYBZU|5|Good charger - however doesn't resume trickle charging after a AC power failure.<br />The easily changeable cable ends are a nice touch if you want to change out for different battery terminals or quick connect / disconnect.
B000K01IZ6|5|Belt fit perfectly on both 2004 and 2007 Saturn VUE's with 3.5L V6 engine.
B00L2YUR7E|1|They were not the  that sharp edges all over it
B003FBV8ZW|4|Great shades for riding and eye protection. They will fog up if your not moving and if wind is not flowing past the frames. The lens is strong and the sides do there job protecting your eyes. The frame fits my face and I have a 55-56 cm fit.
B006G92OC6|5|A+++++
B0031BI23W|5|was an easy part to find.  bolted right on to where the identical one came off.  Works great and the company was great
B004306VTC|5|Nice product good price bought to use with RV had searched everywhere before purchase very pleased ordered 2 would recommend
B000EVYGV4|5|Very good and  good  price
B00479PVQ8|3|I wasn't expecting much after reading other reviews.  However I would say they didn't write for my understanding.  If you are expecting the quality of the free ones you can get (I was) you will be disappointed. Very flimsy not hard plastic and practically 2 dimensional.  Yes I know you can't hold or ship two dimensional, but it is VERY thin, does not hug, or encase the license plate simply lays on the front of the plate under the screws.  The colors aren't as bright as I was expecting.  It is easy to install.  It's okay.  I do not think it is worth the price I paid, a little under $7.00.  But also not worth my time or money to return.  It is on my car.
B0049DVR1U|5|I don't want to jinx myself, but the switch works perfect.  I recommend it!  It works just like the old one.  I just hope it last as long.
B00KTIURMO|5|Awesome
B0090B7M2O|5|I own a 2007 BMW 328xi Coupe. The Autel Elite MD802 set up quickly and read my car's codes without hesitation. I cleared the codes afterwards and only have the lamps to replace before I reset those alerts. The machine is easy to read and navigate through its menus. The short manual was precise and to the point. I like that it can do American, European and Asian vehicles, thereby making the tool useful in the future as my family owns vehicles from all three points of manufacture. I am very happy with my purchase.
B003OSIHXW|1|I bought a pair from Costco, 26\\" & 20\\", I installed them in minutes. They didn't seem to be very secure, I was right, after a few passes with and without fluid on all speeds the drivers side popped off. I re-installed it, after another few passes it popped off again. The passenger side stayed on just fine. I can't trust these wipers.
B002P9974E|5|**Contrary to the review from 2010-this is the correct mirror. It is convex and has the warning label on it. Think he was sent the left mirror and he didn't realize it.**    The plastic of the frame is somewhat lighter weight than the original, but acceptable. It is built to the same design specifications as the original \\"sport\\" mirror and assembly.    There are no instructions in the box, but the entire project took about 7 minutes from opening the Amazon package to making the final adjustments. The only problem I encountered was caused by watching YouTube videos on mirror installation--DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!! They all start by telling you to remove the interior door panel--DON'T DO IT--everything is accessible from the outside. To remove the old mirror assembly, find the seam running horizontally on the base of the holder, jam a flatbladed screwdriver in this seam and force the bottom section down and outward. Everything else is pretty obvious.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Stop Drop worked just as advertised. It is not noticed but stops items from disappearing into that no mans land.
B000CAZ5ZI|5|Fit my 1991 Honda Accord lx. Good price. Cant expect much more then that. Thanks Amazon
B00CC4LX2G|1|My purchase was a scam to pay for 9 lights and only came 2 and not complain to me before that it is not worth sending a report
B00473W5V8|5|Quick Shipper, Thanks!! Great price.
B000F0Z81G|5|Easy to place, stays put, saves the dash from horrid sun damage. But the most important reason I got it is because the gray original vinyl casts a reflective glare on the inside of the windshield. You need a flat surface, black, to kill this reflection. This does the trick.
B001QL00IY|5|i bought one of these from my chiropractor years ago and use it in my office chair.  i have to tell you that my back used to be so bad i couldn't work for more than a couple of hours without pain in the mid back and upper shoulders.  since installing this in my chair, i have absolutly no back pain at all. and it never moves the straps are perfect.  I recently bought the seat cushion from Amazon to go with it as my butt was getting numb from all the hours i pound a computer.  amazing how darn comfortable it is.  i have had many collegues try it out and they all say the same thing... \\"WOW - MAN DOES THIS FEEL GOOD\\" and 'where can i get one'?  it is so worth the $$, i can't begin to tell you!
B00126A1G4|4|Great wringer. My hands can't take it when I try to do it by hand.
B007ROUBYC|4|These batteries came faster than the expected delivery date. I put them on my changer and in under an hour they were both at full charge. Installed them in my back unit and they are working good.
B000C5UFG2|4|This was-the exact part # that toyota had but they wanted way more from the dealership. Great buy, it was exactly like the old sensor
B00FFAXUAM|5|As Advertized
B0012TWSLC|5|Product arrived immediately and was the quality advertised! Thank you!!!
B001GJ3FIS|5|Goooooood
B0092P19T0|2|this says it fits a 2013 escape but the way the window seals run it will not work. the upper strips are connected to the vertical ones and will not allow it to fit under it.
B00CHDE194|5|fits great
B005M1AVFQ|2|The device doesn't read over half of the vehicle's I have tried... I have tried all communication settings as well as multiple receiving devices and still no luck except with vehicles newer than 2011
B0006IX7Y2|4|It works fine, but seems real flimsy.  It it survives more than a season I'd be surprised.  For now it works fine.
B000GU5IH4|4|I have to park my bike outside and this has saved me A LOT of headache. Keeps my bike clean and dry. I would have given it 5 stars except the sizing system was off. It did not calculate in the fact that my bike has a windshield from factory and is a little short. Either way, it covers everything except my front wheel(not a big deal).
B004I8ZWAS|5|Looks as said it would they make my car look cool. I enjoy them! I was looking for tire caps and I found then it made my guys brother a rid bit jealous I just encourage amazon to have them in different color skulls, and more varieties of these caps. Hope it helped!
B003RE1QO0|5|Very nice seat covers. Fit Toyota Tachoma.
B001DRHMPK|5|not much to say, it is what it is
B00FRJH2V4|5|Great Product! Great customer service! Thank you!
B00797NJHS|5|Product was exactly as advertised. It's been on my car for a couple months now and I see no signs of fading, chipping, or peeling.
B007P74A2U|5|It arrived on time and it worked perfect
B0049TUI6E|2|Not exedy brand will work but not as advertised
B0083SL82A|1|Came in damaged and the box was fine.
B000A3I9XW|5|i could replace 2009 macbook pro battery with this one
B007Y90Z00|3|Bike still in the shop, dont know how it will handle high speeds yet, we will see.  Hopefully soon. Okay
B004EIAADG|5|This little guy works great.  It charged up faster than I expected and runs great.  We have used the inverter for several small items with no problems.  I really like how you always know the state of charge.
B002YCE5V2|5|This is a GREAT product and a Great price ! I also received it quick. I had putting off this repair for a long time because of a high dealer price. I finally decided to look for it online and found the Dorman 4X4 switch at Amazon.com. It was easy to install and works great.
B002TMYVXE|5|This was the perfect width and length.. its nice and bold.. even got a few c9mplements. I would recc9mmend this to anybody
B00CF0OZQS|5|Nice ashtray for my back screened in patio. These are hard to find
B007JCSQ6W|5|Easy to cut the loop off if you don't need that part. Quantity of 3 is perfect for my car.
B004OA2Z2S|5|This is a great look for your mopar, it looks great when you open the door and look down. A little difficult to put in, but well worth the end result.
B00H7HSWWM|5|Just what I wanted to Brand my front windshield. So Friends know its me coming at them in my generic little blue car.
B003TKI4VU|4|I purchased this bulb to replace 1156 bulbs in my RV's interior lights. They're okay, but not as bright as the incandescents. I used them to replace the back up lights instead.
B00E3BSI10|5|Works very well. Looks great. And it does not hit my garage door when backing out.
B00FYDAP6M|5|Works just like it says.
B0022Y2BOU|5|This item was received promptly. The product is as described and fits our 2002 HD Electra Glide as replacement speakers.
B001GRTDJU|5|Good fit and this brand is best. I do not have negatives for this product.<br />Fast delivery service.  Stays in place.
B0067WVRPM|4|excelent quality, but can be better, in fact all is good, the helme is eautiful and look like very powerfull, is excelent confort and easy to clean, is really like the description, is very good helmet
B00141A4ZK|5|Super easy to take off old ones, clean it out a bit, then put the new ones on. You can feel the better quality compared to the stock wipers.
B00BG5A2ZQ|3|Little disappointed. Thought they'd be better quality for the price. But still not that bad, can't complain too much as they still look good and do the job. Don't think they gnna last too long tho.
B002MQ2SHS|4|Fits well. Easy to put on and off.  Not breathable, though, so when it stops raining and the sun comes out, I'm sweating. Good visibility and reflective strips. Easy to adjust and fairly easy to get on over boots (velcro at feet and hands). I'm happy.
B00DDV2NL2|3|Works ok. Only get it if you need abs or airbag codes. By a cheap obd2 for better live info. I use my $20 obd2 reader more.
B00IYGAMR8|5|Worked great
B006EGAIII|5|Very durable.
B009G4Y9RG|4|Fit's as expected and no noises. would reorder again from here if needed.. Delivered when promised.
B000LG00OO|5|my father got his car keys stolen from him, and from then on had problems with the car alarm and security...  and  since is a GMC from 2002 I thought it was going to be difficult to find a new remote, but this place had it and it arrived 3 days in advance, I surprised him with it... thank you!!... might buy another one soon, so he can have a spare one
B0002XRB0M|5|Excellent product - does what it says which is it coats the rubber insulation, makes it look new and keeps it looking good for a long time.  Be careful about getting on glass, however, it can be very difficult to remove.
B000CF3XIO|5|This product fit perfectly in my 2002 saturn L300 V6. No modification needed. Turned of engine light never came back. I used free shipping, it was here in 5 work days. I changed this part in 10 min. I unplugged it and used a 7/8 open wrench to change it.
B000CIQ4VE|3|I recognize the material that this cover is composed of... which means I expect it to last up to a year.  I bumped a car door against it and it left a hole in the material.  In case you are wondering, it was a very light tap.
B00E7VEWZ2|5|Don't listen to the cry baby whiners on here. There is zero reason for any complaints about these products. My 14 JKU is a beast on the outside. But the inside I wanted a more subtle, yet noticeable accents. Let me tell you, these were just the ticket. Purchased the entire black/red kit. Very well made. Very thick and sturdy. They don't stick out like a sore thumb. Makes the inside look just right. Love  them. Excellent product. Fast shipping. Will def buy from this seller again if they made anything else that catches my eye for my jeep.
B000AAMY86|5|At last, a gadget with a manual that was actually written by a native-english-speaking, professional tech writer! Manual is excellent although I wish the format were slightly larger for my aging eyes. :-) Haven't used it extensively yet but it is very easy to set up. I don't have any problem seeing the display during the daytime with the default color. The designers thoughtfully included a port for the cable on both the side and the back so you have more mounting flexibility. I'm going to have to get another one of these for my truck, which has a fuel gauge that is notoriously inaccurate. Way cheaper than getting the fuel gauge repaired I'm sure!
B00NIVU3OQ|5|Good choice for my canyon.
B003G9IYQY|5|Worked like a champ and we're heating water with gas again!
B0059XCVVO|2|There are much better quality vinyl wrap out there, this is not one of them. But for the price it's quantity over quality and it would be good for practicing...although it doesn't have the bubble reducing qualities like some of the others, you will get some air pockets with this brand moreso than the ones with &#34;vents.&#34; I would never use this for my customer, because on a closer inspection it's obvious that there are some flaws to the design. I've attached pictures for one from eBay and the SimCarbon.
B00CPGQ2DG|5|Your getting exactly what u pay for great product
B001O0BJUK|5|They are GREAT!
B001CF3ND8|5|works on my 1988 chevy Blazer K5, Had to make it work on the bottom seat part, replaced the bugee with para cord worked fine.
B002ONDN9Q|5|Harley owner loved it so much he already had one I didn't know about. Needed to be returned.
B00B1TNQCS|5|Fits perfectly in my 2014 Offroad bed. Doesn't slide out the back with gate down driving down the road and sheds water and keeps everything from sliding around like a pinball machine. Very happy with purchase!
B00030DLEE|4|Works as advertised, I have used it several time on trips and it is great to have a hot homemade meal when I stop for a break.
B00873J0YY|5|Excellent product!  My only complaint is that I wish the instructions had been clearer regarding sinking the bolts to lock them in place.  Took forever to get them tight.  Other than that, they are sturdy, secure, and work just as desired.  Thank you!
B0001CMUV4|4|Works great to eliminate rattle from loose ball mounts.  I'd give it five stars except the price is a bit high for what it is.
B0012X23MW|5|Installed them myself and they are worth the money. Fast delivery and great service.
B004AJBRUY|3|welds look like my 9 year old could have done better. but for the price cant complain too much.
B000GZTB0E|5|Yuasa quality, and has held up far longer than some of the cheaper brands in my '83 XT550. Arrived in good shape, too. The only downside for some might be that you have to fill with acid, but that's easily found. Good battery
B001N79J2O|3|I have a black GTR black series so I thought it would be great to have a black license plate frame to match it. however, when I received it, it was chrome instead of black. the quality is good and it fits on my GTR, but it's just not black.
B0084O11YI|5|nice sticker smaller than it looks
B001E221A0|5|High quality, easy to install and excellent warranty.  I have had Extang products before and have been completely satisfied with them.
B004OJX7QW|5|Installed on a 2013 RZR 570<br /><br />When shopping for a soft top, I wanted a mesh top, and the hubby wanted solid fabric. His concern was protection from the rain, and when I asked him &#34;When have we EVER opted to go 4 wheeling when rain was in the forecast?&#34; he sheepishly agreed to try the mesh.<br /><br />This top is wonderful. While the mesh is more course than I expected, (see images) it is also a heavier grade than I thought it would be. It provides incredible shade, yet I still get that open air feeling that I didn't want to lose in my quest for some relief from the sun. I don't imagine it would provide much protection from rain, but if that is what you're looking for, you should probably stick to a fabric or hard top.<br /><br />I installed the top myself (I'm a middle aged female) with no tools, and while the instructions featured photos of some other UTV (not any species of RZR), I was easily able to figure it out, and it looks great (see photos).<br /><br />Installation advice: Simply flop it on (the &#34;front&#34; label is well marked), attach the main straps lengthwise (my instructions had them running crosswise on the mystery UTV) snugly, then work the four corner straps slowly around and down, adjusting them as you go to achieve a symmetrical installation. Another plus: If you let your UTV roast in the sun for awhile to warm the mesh up, it is more pliable, the fold marks come out easier, and the velcro tape (provided) sticks very well indeed (I cleaned off the spots where I would be applying the tape with rubbing alcohol first).<br /><br />All in all, this was an excellent purchase, and I'll do it again when we wear this one out!
B005LDKZ2Y|5|As someone who works for a large iPhone repair company, I use these on a regular bases. I can tell a difference in the adhesive when I use these as to when I didn't.
B000H0ZP4E|5|Fits perfect, nice quality.
B00BJNNNQU|5|Excellent product, worried at first that it would be bad, since sanding the headlights is involved, but followed instructions step by step and it worked. Awesome product. Headlights look brand new!
B0009IK84Q|4|Installation is easy.  No true wiping test yet for the blades as we've had no rain here since the installation and I've not yet driven during a snow fall.  However, when I commence a \\"window wash\\" cycle on my wiper blades, they swipe smoothly and clean.
B00BD5GVVI|5|Thanks! Soo perfect
B0009H51MG|1|Purchased the Fram CA4309 Extra Guard Rigid Panel Air Filter for my 2003 Subaru Forester XS. Amazon claimed that this filter would fit my Subaru, well it does not, and now I can not even return it. Shame on them!
B000C5YCRA|5|Same as Toyota factory part.  Wanna waste hundreds more at dealer? Then you are silly.
B00EEDOWU8|1|This splitter ended up causing an ECU trouble code for missing cluster with my Veloster Turbo.
B00CFCI9AY|5|Very good quality item. Heavy duty.
B00C1YI2XA|5|This is an great product this light is super bright and i am planning to order more in the near future
B0024NWYZU|5|They look great on my car
B001G646W0|5|Great item. Arrived quickly. Works as it should. Would buy from again. Quality was very good. No complaints. No problems installing.
B000N3DHZY|4|exact fit
B00S7UQOPA|5|Worked great
B004N1NLOE|5|came on time and exact match thanks
B0016GRTVU|3|Looked good & sturdy enough, but broke during first use; maybe just bad luck?
B000PSMVTA|1|This item does not work at all. There is no way you can match the color. and the heating system is a piece of metal that is suppose to get hot but it does not. please save your money or buy a cover for you couch!
B008LPEZ6Q|4|I wanted to try this in conjunction with other Chemical Guys products, and I thought it worked out well with one side note. You  REALLY HAVE to LIKE what they consider Pineapple. For me, this was a negative when I used the product, but others really liked the smell. That pointed out something I want to stress, because personally I do not like much of a scent period  and do not recall Pineapples smelling like Pi&ntilde;a Colada, but that is wholly subjective and something to keep in mind  when thinking about the overall definition of &#34;clean.&#34;<br /><br />As far as the actual cleaning part, this did a good job, giving the areas I cleaned a luster without the slimy shine or greasy afterward other products sometimes offer. I always hated ArmorAll because of exactly that; using it is like pouring baby oil on your car and I want it clean, not to enter it in an off-the-books wrestling exhibition. I like the idea of UV protection as well; as soon as some sun shines through the December-March mire we seem to be stuck in, I can see it paying off.<br /><br />Were it not for the abhorrent smell, I would have given it five stars and thought it was unfair to dock it too much for that alone. Like I said, others really liked it. Were I only so sensory-deprived.
B00817YH8U|5|Fork seal kit as described and received in good time. Would recommend!
B00B86B58Q|5|highly praised by others.  Fits perfectly
B000OAG2DK|5|I use it in the house bath tub shower.  On-off switch conserves water but still emits a nice stream.
B0087FSA70|5|Amazing  results
B002GQFF7O|5|Excelent product!!!
B0040D2QVE|1|These clips need to be modified to fit correctly on my 1999 Jeep GC
B00O83N0WA|1|Did not fit my Chevy truck as advertised.<br />Exceptionally difficult to install without the guidance of a professional installer.
B0082N40IK|5|material received in good condition it is ok
B0002STSNU|4|I bought this to help me re-use a muffler I had purchased months ago and it was still in very good shape. The tool worked just fine. I had to re-insert and spin it a few times to get my muffler pipe to except the new tailpipe and it held up to my having to use a long handle wrench to stretch out the pipe. This tool having two sizes should help me another day too. My only gripe would be that this smaller sized area could hamper anyone that is working on a pipe a 2-1/4\\" or greater pipe with a bend near the end and won't be able to insert it far enough in thier pipe. It gave me just enough clearence to do my job so I'm happy with it. Made in IOWA, USA?  No real markings though....
B004AE0MUU|5|I gave this product a rating of 5 stars because it was shipped on time, it was priced reasonably, it fit perfectly, and saved me $$$$ from not taking to the dealership to replace.  The video link totaly described the steps and tools required to include wife to replace the broken tail light. Perfect directions and part!!!
B004AHB2HE|4|It cane in on perfect timing. I still put a trickle charge on it after the installations.  So far, so good
B001SSVVZ6|4|A good value -- decal looks as bright and tight as in the photograph.<br /><br />The backing piece of paper peels off, one then places the decal face down on surface and rubs with credit card, lets it sit for about 10 minutes, then slowly peels off. The letters are then  placed on the surface.<br /><br />Note that this is NOT a clear \\"cling\\" decal.  In other words, if you applied the decal to the inside window of say, your car, it would read \\"thgiliwt\\" to anyone looking at it from the outside.
B000C83VWY|5|Fit my 2001 Camry 2.2l engine perfectly. Fixed a bouncing throttle and restored some engine performance. Easy to install as well.
B00BLX6NYM|5|Good addition when changing logos.
B00N3RM186|4|I like it but unfortunately they are not compatible with Chromebooks or Ipads and I can not upload any upgrades.
B0089KNGNQ|5|I can now see the lights come on as I approach the car, and open the door without using a metal key or fob button. The magic is back!<br /><br />Part A was completed after after my 4th (or so) attempt, so I could at least use the car. The B part took probably 2 dozen attempts. (once I even triggered the alarm!)<br />There are many web pages that describe the process and usually have small differences that make the process not work.<br />After reading here: http://priuschat.com/threads/how-to-program-a-new-key-fob-for-full-sks-functionality.133877/<br />I discovered that the old fob is absolutely necessary to program the new one. One must enter the &#34;add&#34; mode (steps 1 - 8), and in my case, press both lock and unlock on the old fob, then both buttons on the new one. Then quickly press the new lock button. The car takes a few seconds to process the data and then cycles the locks just once.<br /><br />I realize that this makes no sense. It will after you have performed the procedure a few times. So, buy this thing and get going!
B002IVEITS|3|Good fit but unsure of the micron it has
B0050CUDHS|5|These are adorable - a must have for any true ferret lover.
B008SF5QHG|5|Nice helmet for a good price
B000KFP2X0|4|Only reason I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars is because it did not come with the grommet as promised.
B0077QFLYA|4|Solid
B005PNO1P2|1|Too small, does not open bottles, key chain broke first day. Junk/Useless
B000EPT7H8|1|i ordered this thinking that they sent all three knobs but they only send one. I tried to go ahead and use it but the cut out for the knob to fit onto my truck didn't even closely match. I would not recommend this to anyone
B0006IX87S|5|We use this water filter for filling our RV and for filling up the dog's water bucket.  It works great as the water doesn't have the horrible chlorine flavor.
B0047RKS72|4|they're bright and they make the car look better, however they don't last as long as oem lights, they're cheap and they make the car look better so I guess it was worth it.
B000GTULAE|5|Everything about this purchase went perfectly smooth.  The Book arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition. The price was about 1/2 that of others that were used while this was new.   Not much else to say as this is a Manual and it IS a Haynes Manual which pretty much assures that it is the detail and quality that one might want for such a manual.
B000BFR6TM|5|This item is very sturdy.  It fit like a glove and feels like it should last a long time.  Mach 3 TSR RV AC
B00AYXM4DY|5|lasted over a year on Avalanche
B000GVBVCY|5|Works great
B000VKTUO6|5|Last week I was at the dealership and they wanted $65 to change this cabin filter in my 2008 Civic!  Instead, I ordered this filter from Amazon for $9.  It fit perfectly and took all of 2 minutes to change the filter.  Easy way to save myself $56!  Thanks Amazon!
3293390102|3|I was very pleased with this LED.  I used it as a reverse light on my 2003 Explorer.  It has very bright light output and easy to install.  I give 3 stars because the product only lasted about 13 months before malfunctioning.  I was under the impression that LEDs outlasted incandescent bulbs by years.
B00C80HSU0|4|this is a pretty good dash light. for the price, you get a descent dash light that produces a good amount of light during the day, and performs perfectly at night. overall, a good buy
B007TY5FDW|4|Worked and fitted perfect no complaints at all
B00CT6WTQQ|5|Fits perfectly!!!!
B000WJIJNO|4|good item
B001NYGAW4|5|Thank u perfect fit!!!!very satisfied...
B005EJGSQ2|2|While it works, it works very well. But the wires eventually broke in the deep freeze. I soldered them back together but it didn't work. It happened with two of these items (got one as a gift, bought the second one when the first one stopped working). Both died the same season.
B00IKSN0CE|4|Good for the price. They just sit a little bit low than the stock ones.
B00FWOKKGI|4|Wish it came with wiring kit but light is super bright and mounted great on rzr
B000QIJKJI|5|THE FIT WAS GREAT.
B000GKJKGE|3|Delivery time ok, wrong part.
B000CSINYK|5|I couldn't help but notice as I browsed through several of these style fuel filters that the &#34;frequently bought together&#34; items include a number of adapters that go from 1/2-28 to 3/4-16 or something similar. Anyone who has a reason to attach a 3/4-16 thread adapter to the end of something threaded 1/2-28 or 5/8-24 (whatever those reasons may be) should know that these fuel filters are all tapped for 3/4 NPT and are not necessarily compatible with 3/4-16 threads. Sure, you can screw a 3/4-16 threaded end into a 3/4 NPT female and it will seem to be quite snug, but understand that the 3/4 NPT end is designed to accept a tapered 3/4 NPT thread end and NOT a 3/4-16 straight thread. The result is that you only have one or two wyths of thread mated up with the fuel filter and that union may not adequately seal, which could be really bad. Also, don't screw them together too tightly or the steel threads on the 3/4 - 16 end will gall the aluminum 3/4 NPT threads and when you finally get it out you will need a new fuel filter. Be careful out there and observe all of the laws of this land at all times.
B004HXGT4C|5|I have have no fit issue with my Patagonia 11.5 Drifter a/c boots.  Hiked in them today - the approach took us over glare ice with water on it.  We walked through those conditions like it was a summer day.  I have tried other products that have come apart, come off, provided inadequate traction, and broken.  I am delighted to have these at a fraction of the price of similar products. They are a great value in my opinion.
B000SBCHCA|5|Great Buy!!
B0002SQXRO|3|After receiving these feeler gauges and opening them to inspect, about 75% of them had surface rust on them. Very little oil was on them. My only other complaint is i wish there were more thicknesses.
B004TRKBOK|4|Have not needed to use it.  (great) looks like it will work just fine.  Would recommend.
B003AONJPQ|5|I bought several different bags for my Jeep from Rugged Ridge.<br />The quality is very good and the price is fair.
B000IY7RWM|5|Arrived quickly and fit my 2004 Pontiac Vibe with no issues.  It eliminated the noise I was having at start-up which was due to the original leaking shock/spring part of the assembly.
B004ZVXFZ2|5|Arrived very quickly less then four days better and brighter than factory.<br />Does not feel cheap,really bright.size came different but doe sent matter it fits great.
B003UM7B98|5|Sturdy design, smooth operation, up quick, and can go down slow and smooth, easily controllable decent, light enough for me to carry and move around by myself, convenient handles, car protective sleeve on handle.
B0002JN2EU|3|it was more of a preventative maintenance precaution but, I added 1 bottle to my oil and fuel and am getting ready to change it now at least a month later, I check it regularly and it isn't dirty yet which could be precision Swedish craftsmanship or, I wasted some money on a product I didn't really need. My car is running great and am hopeful about the other two bottles I have as one is going in my fathers truck he left me and the other I'm saving for when/if it's really needed. I have ran STP cleaner through it previously pretty regular which might be the reason it isn't really cleaning much else out.
B007MHKP4A|5|It is a beautiful color pink and very easy to apply! I put one on each of my girls windows and they love it!!!
B0052B4T2C|4|I love this steering wheel cover.  It is soft and cushioned.  It makes holding the wheel a lot easier and no your hand does not slip at all on it.  Th only reason that I rated this a 4 is that I usually tow a trailer and when I back up with one hand and I slid it around the wheel, it seems that it tweaks the cover and I always have to readjust it when I am done. Yet, during normal use that doesn't happen.  Other then that I love it and I have one in each of my trucks.  I do recommend the one with pink for the girls.  I have that one in my personal truck as I find it way cutier.
B0096IKV7E|4|It is a good pair of seat belt pads, well made product, and if you have a Toyota-will make a nice addition!
B000NCOKZQ|5|This does exactly what I needed it to do. I used it to hook up a battery to my solar panel.
B00K85PLJM|5|Installed this system on a factory 2014 LT2 Corvette.The difference in sound and performance is amazing!!! Would recommend this to all corvette owners, you will drive the wheels off your car after hearing it
B0000AXNMO|5|My husband drives Semi tractor trailers and rain x is a must as it really does allow the water to bead off the windshield you could get away with out using your wipers even in a hard down pour but common sense says use the wipers any way. This is one of the neatest products on the market today
B000BRMXTS|5|[[A great wish i had it long ago    SIN:B000BRMXTS Highland 31460 Bull Ring Anchor Point - Set of 2]]
