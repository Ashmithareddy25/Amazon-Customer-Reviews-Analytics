B000002UAX|4.0|This record was never one of my favorites despite many good songs, and I know why:  The lack of collaboration.  It like each song is a solo effort, and it turns out they pretty much were. I think John and Paul needed each other to be consistantly great. I also think the lack of great Solo albums by the two bears this out.
B000001E18|5.0|Not too many people seem to like this album, calling it pretentious experimentations into trashy dance rhythms, but &quot;Zooropa&quot; is so much more. While &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; took a turn for the dark, groovy, yet eery and sensual side of commercialism and debauchery, &quot;Zooropa&quot; takes those themes and literally makes fun of them (a strange approach when considering &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was making fun of materialism and televised oddity...&quot;Zooropa&quot; takes it further). The songs flow well together, and yet they don't sound alike at all, there seems to be no solid continuity or aspect that ties them all into a cohesive package. However, this is partially the point. The album makes fun of televised commercialism, and what better way to do so than to make an album that is so disjointed it actually sounds like someone flipping channels?<br />&quot;Zooropa&quot;- begins with the twisted barrage of advertisements and catch slogans until Edge's sonic guitar licks bring us into Bono's words of warning about technology's grip on society. A great song, though it seems more like three songs.<br />&quot;Babyface&quot;- a sweet little ditty with a beautiful lullaby-like chime loop that could bring tears to the eyes. Quite a departure from where we thought the first song was leading.<br />&quot;Numb&quot;- probably the best experiment on the album. Edge's monotone words of &quot;do&quot;'s and &quot;don't&quot;'s just blatantly make fun of the notion of subliminal messages in television and advertisements. Bono's hook, &quot;Gimme some more&quot; brings the point across even more, showing society's penchant for wanting more and more to the point of numbness to the dangers of their own indulgence. Definitely the best song on the album.<br />&quot;Lemon&quot;- like a lemon, this song is very sour, but oh so sweet. This has to be the song most influenced by Brian Eno, for if it weren't for Bono's high-pitched gospel-like voice, it probably would not be out of place on a Brian Eno solo album.<br />&quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close)&quot;- a bittersweet love song, something no U2 album is without. Like &quot;Until the End of the World,&quot; from &quot;Achtung Baby,&quot; this song is a title track to a Wim Wenders film, but &quot;Stay...&quot; seems closer to &quot;One&quot; from &quot;Achtung...&quot;, at least thematically, but almost in the opposite direction, making &quot;Stay...&quot; almost a lament of love, while &quot;One&quot; was an outright love song.<br />&quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car&quot;- my favorite song on the album, next to &quot;Numb.&quot; The rhythms are groovy and downright danceable. A surefire hit in dance clubs, with a great bassline and some excellent guitar textures.<br />&quot;Some Days are Better than Others&quot;- a lounge-like catchy groove with some of the funniest lyrics I've ever heard, yet it is still a very serious song, with a serious message. &quot;Some Days are Better than Others.&quot;<br />&quot;The First Time&quot;- the same guitar riff from &quot;All I Want is You,&quot; from &quot;Rattle &amp; Hum.&quot; But this song seems sadder, probably because it's more subdued, but it's one of the clearest indications of U2's penchant for formula and repeating themselves. That aside, it's a great song, and was very well placed in Wim Wenders' &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; (Bono wrote the script for that movie).<br />&quot;Dirty Day&quot;- I'm still not sure what I think of this song, so...don't ask me.<br />&quot;The Wanderer&quot;- I'm not a fan of Johnny Cash, but for some reason his vocals on this song helped bring a closing sense to the album, like the elder prophet answering the question that beckoned to the last. In a sense, we are all wanderers trapped in this desert of sonic desolation and televised decadence. I don't think this song would have been done justice by Bono or Edge. Great little hidden portion of broadcast static to finally turn the noise off.<br/>I think this is the closest U2 ever got to a concept album, and while it may not seem cohesive or solid in a sense of continuity, the album is more about themes and messages, the pleasant and humorous dangers of advertisements and television, yet it still panders to a society's need for self-indulgence. The album won a Grammy in '93 for &quot;Best Alternative Album,&quot; and it was well-deserved! This is a brilliant album! Give it a chance. It's trashy for a reason...try to understand the joke instead of dimissing it just because you don't get it.
B000001DQI|5.0|I thought this was the best album (CD) I've ever heard! There are of course the popular hit &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;, &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;. Then there's the soulful &quot;I've Seen That Movie Too&quot; and sweet &quot;Harmony&quot;. And last, but not least, the surprisingly cheerful &quot;Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)&quot; and memorable &quot;Dirty Little Girl&quot;. Even if you're not an Elton John fan you'll love this CD.
B0000028VT|5.0|What can I say? This is still the best cd Mariah has made to date. This cd has it all. Hero, which is a very inspirational song, is one of the best. I've been thinking about you is one of my favorites on this cd, because (and let me know if I am wrong) we have always had those moments when we just want to break out of our shell and tell the one we love what we think of them. Eventhough this cd had generated only 2 #1 singles (dreamlover, hero), I think that this cd is truly a spiritual, inspiring, romantic work of art; which would turn the head of any hopeless romantic.
B000002BBY|5.0|I believe that this the most important Brit rock album in the last 20 years and it still sounds as good today as it did the day it came out. Sure Oasis arent quite as popular these days, but this album should be in everyones collection.  From the opening cords to last chords of Champagne SuperNova this album is something special. In 20 years from now this Album will be the album of this era, not the overly downing Ok computer (which is a masterpiece in its own right)this music has something special and elegant, but has that Gallagher edge. If you dont have it get, someday your kids will want to listen to it
B00004TH83|5.0|Like many others, I bought this cd for the sole reason of &quot;I will love again&quot;. I was so glad I did. This cd has amazing vocals mixed with emotions and incredible musical accompaniment to follow. I love this cd. It has a little bit of everything for everyone. For all those falling in love, falling out of love, and those even looking for love. It even has a song in italian which is great considering this cd has all the lyrics included. Thank God she decided to sing in english. Get this cd, you wont be sorry.
B0000508U6|1.0|Someone wanna tell these guys that they are 10 years late with their sound? This type of music didn't catch on in the early 90s, what makes Coldplay think it's gonna work now?
0345441184|5.0|Somehow, in all of my reading, I missed this wonderful book!  What a shame that I have missed this book until now!  This is the Arthurian legends written from the womens' point of view.  Morgaine is the woman you hear from the most, but all of their thoughts are in here to expand the story as it has never been done before.  I confess, I am halfway through this book and can barely put it down!  I feel that any one interested in Arthurian legends, fantasy novels, or Paganism should read this book!  It is one that you will treasure forever!
B00003CXBK|4.0|Damn I love this anime. It's different from other fantasy anime, mostly because its a strane time. No ninjas, no dwarfes and no sorcerers, just a fantastic medievel feeling, a time where iron and gunpowder start to rule the struggle for power. The theme, man vs. nature, is very well don and the relation between the hero and the girl adopted by nature is tense all the way. Defenitly the best fantasy I seen, but I cant be compared to more tolkien-inspired animes like 'record of lodoss war'. I liked the subbed version though, the expressions in the japanese language is very hard to convert. Anyway, a great buy!
6303212379|5.0|Okay, I'm 19 and most every other 19 y/o I know has seen this film, I mean it's like everyone around my age range has viewed this film and loved it. It's a great film and I just wish I was going on the adventure with them. I didn't want it to end. Hey Steven, do us a favor and put this on DVD! We need this! I've been watching this film on television for years and the nostalgia just kills me! I love it!
B000051VWW|3.0|I have collected every one of Sade's previous CDs. I love her style and vocal grace. Her alto has depth and passion and I was hoping for something similar to previous releases with depth and insight and pure imagination. This CD seems like it was put together with the same &quot;sound&quot; over and over again on each track. I was truly disappointed after waiting for so long. This is not worth buying.
B000001DU5|5.0|This album is just beautiful from beginning to end. No wonder they were incredible hitmakers during the 80's. I mean it's just beautiful music endlessly. Don't deprive yourself of this treat any longer. Get it now!
B000000WCA|1.0|This album is an album that belongs in the garbage. First of all their first single off the album Wannabe, what a joke! The lyrics in it are so childish and do not make any sense whatsoever, I mean come on &quot;if you wannabe my lover you gotta get with my friends&quot; Please! The song Naked, I have no freaking idea even what the point of that song is, it talks about some girl who is naked,but what else does it explain, nothing. The only promising song on this album is Say You'll Be There. Although the Spice Girls show there soft side in the song Mama, they have songs that glorify having promiscuous sex and those songs should not be the type of songs displayed in their album especially since it is targeted at such a young audience. Spice Girls have no musical talent whatsoever and should drop out of the music business, because their material isn't music at all and is and should be an embarassment to pop artists everywhere.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Released at the front end of what might be Lilith Fair's last hurrah, Mirrorball is a take-home sampler of the live performances that have catapulted McLachlan into the modern rock stratosphere. Over half of the album's 14 songs are radio hits (including four of the first five), proving McLachlan's worth as a pop songstress bar none, but also hinting at an underlying stagnation in her recent musical output. Though fans of McLachlan and folks who missed her Lilith performances will likely enjoy Mirrorball, it's a little too by-the-book to win any converts or please critical listeners. There is few dialogue between songs, for example, and the sound quality is so pristine that if it weren't for the occasional hoot and holler from the audience one would never know it's a live album.
B000000WFF|1.0|When I was about 14 or 15 years old I used to think that the Spice Girls were a cool girl group, but now almost of the age of 21 I realize just how unoriginal and untalented the girls of this group are, well except for Melanie Chisolm. Although I enjoyed one or two of the songs on this album that are the sultry and slow song Too Much and the funky and upbeat song Saturday Night Divas the rest of the songs on the album don't make up for it. The only reason I believe that the Spice Girls are popular is because they are in phenomenal shape and are beautiful. They cannot sing if their lives depended on it. Personally I think that Melanie C could do so much better on her own without these untalented women.I don't know what is so special about the Spice Girls. I wouldn't be surprised that in 2 or 3 years from now the Spice Girls will be no more and I think that would do the music world a lot of good.
B00004T9UF|5.0|It's hard to know what to make of Eminem, even if you know that half of what he says is sincere and half is a put-on; the trick is realizing that there's truth in the joke, and vice versa. Many dismissed his considerable skills as a rapper and social satirist because the vulgarity and gross-out humor on The Slim Shady LP were too detailed for some to believe that it was anything but real. To Eminem's credit, he decided to exploit that confusion on his masterful second record, The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem is all about blurring the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary, so it makes perfect sense that The Marshall Mathers LP is no more or no less &quot;real&quot; than The Slim Shady LP. It is, however, a fairly brilliant expansion of his debut, turning his spare, menacing hip-hop into a hyper-surreal, wittily disturbing thrill ride. It's both funnier and darker than his debut, and Eminem's writing is so sharp and clever that the jokes cut as deeply as the explorations of his ruptured psyche. The production is nearly as evocative as the raps, with liquid bass lines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes. There may not be overpowering hooks on every track, but the album works as a whole, always drawing the listener in. But, once you're in, Eminem doesn't care if you understand exactly where he's at, and he doesn't offer any apologies if you can't sort the fact from the fiction. As an artist, he's supposed to create his own world, and with this terrific second effort, he certainly has. It may be a world that is as infuriating as it is intriguing, but it is without question his own, which is far more than most of his peers are able to accomplish at the dawn of a new millennium.
B000002HH2|5.0|As always, when it comes to Bjrk, I was quite taken with this album. Every song creates a whole unique world for the imagination to roam.  One can hear instantly that this album is not a &quot;product&quot; created only for money making, but there are a bunch of really creative people behind it. As it is typical of Bjrk, the use of all kinds of different instruments and rhytms bring a feeling of newness to this album. When I first heard this album I thought to myself, &quot;Finally something that I haven't heard a thousand times already&quot; I think the best on this album is (in addition to Bjrk's incredible voice, of course) the huge variety between the songs and the little intriguing stories told by every song. To like this album one must have an open mind and to be ready to hear something incredible. An awesome album!
B0000021RG|2.0|Review Update: I just finished sampling the Rhino remastered set of this. Now that's what I wanted!! I sampled this, the original recordings. I still find it murky, but the remastered set [[ASIN:B00006FM77 At Carnegie Hall, Vol. 1-4 (Chicago IV)]] KICKS [...]!! That's why I loved this band. Here's my original review:<br />I saw Chicago Transit Authority once, and until '78, saw Chicago more than any other band. When this incredibly packaged set was originally released, I bought it immediately. The packaging was wonderful, but what did great drawings of Carnegie Hall have to do with the content? Absolutely nothing, nada, zip, bupkis! The packaging is why I've rocketed up to 2 stars on this review  This is generally considered to be the worst live album of all time, narrowly edging out everyone's fave cover band Three Dog Night's \\"Live At The Forum\\", and the Grateful Dead's \\"Steal Your Face\\".  Perhaps a compressed edition of this canine might be in order. The big problem is the basic recording job. From a cheapo Philco stereo down to my buddy's all-Dynaco & Klipsch setup, this sounds like somebody's bootleg, taped on a condensor mike from inside a brushed suede shoulder bag!  I don't know who the engineers were on this, but I suspect they may have been French telephone enigineers fired for incompetence! Ignore this P.O.S, & invest in audiophile copies of CTA up to Chicago 7. I recently ran into this set on LP, in great shape, used, for two bucks. It was overpriced.
014028009X|4.0|I guess I'm late on the bandwagon as I just picked this book up the other day.  It's a very quicky and easy read.  I didn't necessarily think it was &quot;hysterical&quot;, but it had it's moments where I was highly amused.<br />I think this book comically conveys that society as a whole expect that women, once in their thirties, to get married and start having children.  And if they don't, then they are unhappy.  And then there's the other side of the coin - the married thirty-somethings, although somewhat content in their married lives, sometimes wish they were single again as they crave that freedom of singledom.  A double-edged sword.  I believe it portrays a very realistic view of those expectations as well as  the flaws in both of those generalizations.<br />Some people may see this book as a stereotypical view of women.  A thirty-something women is obsessed about her weight, men, smoking, being alone.  But haven't all women, at one time or another, experienced those same apprehensions?  I know that I have.  While I've never gone to the extreme that Bridget has, I can relate.  And so, I relished with great interest, what would happen to Bridget next.  I also liked the group of people around Bridget, it was good to see that see had such good friends.<br />I definitely recommend this book.  It may help you realize that maybe you shouldn't take things so seriously.  No doubt about it - it's a fun book!
B00000K3G8|5.0|ALLAN HARRISON mentioned the overdubs, he's right, though some people mistake that with offstage singing from Edna and Lynn.. during &quot;Heaven&quot;. It doesnt bother me a bit if they wanted to sweetening it up a bit.. I dont have the audio cd yet, but i watch the dvd about once every 2 weeks..The first cd was missing songs that prevented me from wanting to buy it. this time I'm seriously considering getting a cd player in my car
B0000019PA|5.0|On the first listen to this masterpiece you may go...humm...or yuck...or maybe...wow.  You'll go to bed and wake up with each and every song etched into your conscious and then it will slowly become your favorite lp of the year.  Its a clash of discordant blasts, off-key vocals, sonic booms layered on beautiful acoustic melodies that keeps you coming back for more.
1558216847|5.0|Unbelievably real.  Totally engrossing.  You won't believe it's true, but it is!!!  I can truly say that I have never been so glued to a story.
0767817478|4.0|Many obviously agree that this film sucked, but were they expecting too much out of it? Of course they were. Before this movie was released, people were still going through the notorious &quot;Titanic&quot; hype and comparisons which scarely crept up in nearly every review &quot;Post-Titanic&quot; in 1998. Not only were people expecting a better movie but at this time, many were still into the ID4 craze which of course was also directed by Roland Emmerich. Okay, ID4 created a very small cult following it's likely people were expecting the intelligent fun once again from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin in &quot;Godzilla&quot;.<br />I have to say that I myself, being an original &quot;Godzilla&quot; fan and an ID4 fan thought it was a blessing that our favourite duo would take the helm of directing and producing &quot;Godzilla&quot;, but I was well prepared since that I know that film makers never make their next film any similar to the last, which is where my disapointment for this film was at a minimum. Yet I just cannot get over how badly this film was handled, Sony really must have underestimated their missed audience (the original Godzilla fans) who were the ones REALLY waiting for the film. Their target audience was surprisingly teens and young kids, the overhype and badly put together Promotional Compilation Soundtrack CD were one of numerous examples of failed expectations from those who thought they were seeing a re-hash of ID4. This film could have been promoted and put together much better than it actually was.<br />And finally the film itself, unfortunately it plays like an MTV rock video at various times in the film, and the advertisments throughout the film promoting Sony products just makes one want to bawl over how much money is spent desperately to sell products. Sony obviously thought this'd be bigger than &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;Titanic&quot; but they had no REAL target audience to actually understand it. Okay, enough of the promotion blabber, onto the plot. It has a simple plot but somehow predictable during viewing for the first time. I'm not much on giving away plot details or spoilers. However this film has a weaker meaning and feel than the original, American film makers seem to believe that if it's not American, it has to be remade (or something like that). The original theme of the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; was about man's rape of the natural world and nature biting back with it's and man's ultimate unstoppable hybrid revenge and so on from the original Nueclear Bomb dropped on Japan (Americans, anyone?). These overtones are sadly missing from this version, Devlin claimed they were there but I saw no sign of it at all.<br />Of course this film seems to just ultimately represent how low Hollywood film making can get, even from a good film maker but it did have the potential to actually be a great film but all of that was sadly lost due to the studio's bad taste.<br />Hopefully another film maker can achieve with &quot;Godzilla&quot; what Emmerich and Devlin had failed to do.
B00002E285|5.0|Thank you very much for the opportunity to express my oppinion about such a masterpiece, created first, by Pink Floyd (one of the finests Bands in the world), and by Alan Parker (a geniuos  movie Directior).  To understand the deepness of the story, about the Histtory  itself, is very complicated.  To put it in images (with the great music made by the Pink Floyd), requires of of great talent, and I think Mr. Parker is the ownwer of one greateast . The movie is not (I do understand why), what Hollywood film makers, should consider a &quot;best seller&quot; one.  In stead, it is smart act of creativitity created by a communion of talents.  WATCH -do not 'SEE'- the film.  LISTEN - do not 'EAR'- to the marvelous music composed by these very fine musicians, and OPEN your mind... THINK!...<br />MAKE A REFLECTION about LOVE, betrayal,frustration, FRIENDSHIP, fascism, and, the nowadays so called GLOBALITATION (?).  Remember WW II, and do your own desition about the future... where would you like your family and you to live in the future?  Outside or inside The Wall...?  Thank you very much again.<br />P. D. Sorry about my english.
0553106635|5.0|I have read many reviews of fantasy fiction and wondered at the enthusiasm granted some books/authors. It seems that many reviewers are too ready to elevate very average fiction to that of truly great writing. I enjoy authors such as Goodkind, Modesitt and even better Donaldson. When you compare their books to this series however, the former works are generally inferior. This is the first time I have granted a 5 star rating for a book. I believe such praise should be reserved for those titles that are superior in measure to other GOOD books. Martin has succeeded in creating a gritty, dark and unpredictable story that will leave the most experienced reader wondering. Is it perfect? No. On occasion some characters seem a somewhat thinly drawn and too predictable. Most however are rich and hard to classify. They are coloured in shades of grey rather than black/white. This alone, for example, puts Martin's work above the easy predictablility of Goodkind's. This is adult fantasy with adult situations. Fantasy can rightly be described as literary escapism much like McDonald's serves &quot;junk food.&quot; Tastes good but doesn't offer a lot for you. Martin's work is not the kind of fiction for those looking for the quick payoff. Storm of Swords is a finer example of the genre. It is literary fantasy worthy of being placed on the short list of the best of the type. Can't wait for #4
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I own loads of Beatles stuff and wondered if there was a point in buying this collection. There definately is.  First, although I've listened to all of these songs over and over, it is awe inspiring to hear their entire career slotted into 70 or so minutes. They did it all and you hear it in this disk.  The remastering of the tracks is another reason to get it.  They obviously did a rush job on some of the songs, but overall the sonics are markedly improved. (Not as good as the remixed Yellow Submarine though!-don't expect that) The booklet is nice but could have had far more goodies. Still it's nice to see most of  the single covers collected in one spot.  Finally, we get some songs in stereo on Cd that we haven't had yet! I Want to Hold Your Hand, She Loves You, and other early tracks like AHDN have been released in mono only and appear here in a legit release for the first time.
B00003CXSP|4.0|I read the book in the spring of 00 and could not wait till the movie was released in theaters. I went to watch it with my friends and although hannibal was in no way better than the silence of the lambs, it was - at least - a good way to get your funny bone tickled. this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. even the ending was a good laugh - hannibal giving paul krendler his on brains to eat. Jokes put aside, the movie is very good. it'll scares the hell outta you - most of all of the girls. it's is a gripping, very brutal movie, very true to the book (except the ending), very true to the characters.  In six words: very rich, very scary, very disappointing. Ridley Scott knows what he's doing.  In certain aspects I prefered the film to the book. For exemple the perverse sister of mason verger was left out - a good decision. she was a complete exaggeration, too much considered the other ill-minded characters of the story. My favorite part in the movie is when Hannibal kills the cop Pazzi who wanted to sell him to verger. Very cool scene - comparable to the one in silence of the lambs, when the swat team enters the room in which hannibal's cage is. the camera first shows us the cops securing the room, then it swerves, putting our eyes on the jesus-like figure suspended from the bars of the cage, arms spread to a perfect t, body ripped, guts hanging out. I think I will never forget this scene. I certainely will buy Hannibal on dvd and you guys reading this review should do exactly the same. and if you're a real hannibal &quot;the cannibal&quot; fan you'll read the book to.
B000002MUW|5.0|Many people have said they don't like this CD because Madonna changed her style to a more R&amp;B type mix.  Madonna is always changing her style.  If you put this, Madonna, Like A Prayer and Music together you couldn't tell it was the same artist.  This CD draws you in with quality songs.  The first track Survival is one of my favorites.  Secret is my absolute favorite on the CD.  Take A Bow is a nice ballad, and Bedtime Stories is a innovative track with a unique video.  So many of the songs are highlights it's hard to name them all.  If you are a Madonna fan, your collection is not complete until you purchase this.  It's worth it.
B000059POY|5.0|YOU KNOW, WITH THE TALENTS OF MARLON BRANDO, RICHARD BURTON, WALTER MATTHAU, SUGAR RAY ROBINSON, RINGO STARR, JAMES COBURN, JOHN ASTIN, JOHN HUSTON, IN THIS MOVIE. THERE IS NO WAY, ANYONE CAN WATCH THIS MOVIE AND NOT ASK THE QUESTION, &quot;WHAT WAS THESE MAJOR STARS THINKING, WHEN THEY MADE THIS MOVIE?&quot; SO, DESPITE THE FACT, THAT THIS MOVIE WILL NEVER BE CONFUSED WITH AN OSCAR-WINNER FOR BEST PICTURE. NONETHELESS, THANKS TO THE BEAUTIFULLY DELICIOUS-LOOKING, EWA AULIN, SHE IS THE REASON WHY THAT, BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT, BEYOND ALL DOUBTS...THIS IS A VERY SEXY MOVIE!!!
B00004SCX6|3.0|I personally don't think this album is anything exceptional.  I bought it after hearing clips of What U See and Can't Make You Love Me on the radio.  Those two songs are great, and Lucky is another good track.  But the rest are either bad or mediocre.  Oops I Did It Again and Stronger were overplayed.  Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is on the boring side.  Dear Diary is a song I'm having a hard time taking seriously.  Another bad side of the album is that Britney's voice isn't exceptional.  It's unique, but it doesn't sound good on many of the tracks.  While Jessica and Christina can really sing, they seem to be overshadowed by Britney which in my opinion isn't very fair.  So in conclusion, it's worth buying if you've liked the singles from the album already.  However the radio has overplayed a good majority of the songs on the album.
B00000J6AG|2.0|Hello Readers-<br />Now I know why I was hypnotized by the sound of Moby's &quot;Everloving&quot;.  If you're a Cure devotee like me, you'll notice that if you sing &quot;Apart&quot; to the beat of &quot;Everloving&quot; it fits perfectly.  Now I don't know if Moby had &quot;Apart&quot; in mind when he composed &quot;Everloving&quot;, but it sure sounds like it.  Either way it's a great instrumental w/ a tinge of new wave/gothic-just like The Cure!
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is one of the best! I must rate it way up there with Star Trek: First Contact and Star Wars: Episode I Surprisingly it's not a great movie because of the SFX but because of a storyline that makes you think, too many movies lately have been without story (MI:2?!?!, not to say it was a bad movie though!)
0316779237|1.0|A friend recommended this book to me, said it was a pleasant departure from standard sweet holiday writing.  It was a departure, for sure - but NOT AT ALL pleasant.  I actually enjoyed Sedaris' writing style, even the sarcasm, but much of the  content was disturbing at best.  I gave up after a section that ended in a particularly horrific death.  Only one nice thing I can say for it - it made me appreciate the high-calorie sweet holiday stories once again.
B00003CX8J|3.0|This time I had my hopes up for an extraordinary movie with my favourite comic heroes. But nooo.<br />Yes, the sound, picture and effects are all very good. But that is all. I'm extremely dissapointed about the characters and the story. Some fightingscenes are laughable. Characters are made almost as if they came from the comic, but some features was put aside. A lot of characters was also missing. They Show Xaviers School, and they show the time when Wolverine entered the Xavier World. Where are all the other characters from that particular time? And when was ever Wolverine And Rogue friends? What a bad adaptation *sigh*.... I still ask myself if the director actually read the comic? And if he did, why did he do such a bad job of the adaptation? Did he only read a single comic or what?<br />The Phoenix-story is without a doubt the greates of them all. I'm hoping to see that one for the next film. <br />But, as far as adaptation for this film it is a lot better than Batman, Blade, The Mask, the very bad Judge Dredd and other bad attempts out there.<br />If you are NOT, as I am, a bigtime fan of the x-men comic, then this is a great film to watch. It has it all. Sci-Fi, action, comedy,story and excitement you could expect.<br />If you have read x-men for a while (iv'e been so far back I can remember), you will be dissapointed, I'm sure.<br />My rating is for the 'attempt' of making an adaptation of a comic. I was almost about to give it a 1, but changed my mind because some of the characters actualy are pretty good.<br />The quality(sound/picture) of this film is 5 / 5. Topnotch.<br />Next time it will be good *hoping*<br />Note to directors - LISTEN to the fans....
B00000J7S8|5.0|Diana Krall is a modern day diva of sexy jazzy soul. And this album once again proves it. I have been enjoying it for awhile, but recently rediscovered something special. I just finished watching a movie called &quot;True Crime.&quot; It features and down and out recovering alcoholic played by none other than Clint Eastwood. In addition to acting, Eastwood also wrote and directed the film. And, as you may know, Eastwood is also a jazz fan. So, after meeting the charming and soulful Diana Krall - what did he do? He asked Diana Krall to sing a couple of songs that he had written - including one very beautiful tune called WHY SHOULD I CARE? After seeing the movie - and hearing the song written by Krall - I went to look for Diana's recorded version. But strange - it wasn't listed anywhere. Surely she had recorded. Well, it turns out that she did record it - but as a bit of a mystery, surprise - and honor to her friend Clint Eastwood, she simply recorded it on this album - and left it as a surprise at the end of the album. So - buy the album, listen in to the song writing of Clint Eastwood - and the beauty of Diana's voice. Listen and sing along...<br />Why Should I Care? (Written by Eastwood, voice by Krall) - the final mystery track.<br />Was there something more I could have done?  Or was I not meant to be the one?  Where's the life I thought we would share?  And should I care? <br />And will someone else get more of you?  Will she go to sleep more sure of you?  Will she wake up knowing you're still there?  And why should I care? <br />There's always one to turn and walk away  And one who just wants to stay  But who said that love is always fair?  And why should I care? <br />Should I leave you alone here in the dark?  Holding my broken heart  While a promise still hangs in the air  Why should I care? <br />Enjoy the surprise music lovers!
B000003TAW|5.0|I first heard this album when I lived in New Zealand, I was 13, it was brilliant then and it still is now! Timeless. One of my favorite albums of all time! Perhaps its not as sophisticated as the music I'm *supposed* to like as a chorus teacher, but... Those infectious melodies, delicious harmonies, distorted guitars, and words to which I can connect! You won't find any duds on this album.
B000002WYT|5.0|As a poet, the beautiful lyrics of this CD inspired me tremendously. As a romantic, I fell in love with many of these songs. As someone who loves music to death and gets restless without hearing quality music- this fullfilled me and made me fall in love with this band that I barely knew about, but loved the radio single &quot;Crash Into Me.&quot; As someone who has to ease into change slowly, I could not help but keep hitting back and listening to some of these amazing songs over and over again, until going on to the next song. Over the summer, I found myself coming out of a touch of writer's block and completely branching into poetry writing something like 3 a day just from listening to &quot;Crash Into Me&quot;- a song I adore... And when waiting in the airport for our plane, I found myself once again perusing the CD booklet of lyrics. As someone who can be pretty emotional, I found out that there are songs on this CD for every mood, because each song is so introspective and soulful.  It justs hit you at every level of human emotion. As someone who is listening to &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; for the thousandth time and still being incredibly touched by Dave's lyrics of apartheid in South Africa, I could not recommend this CD more. If you like great music, this CD is a complete keeper.  You'll find yourself delving deeper and deeper into this beautiful music.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Hollywood--In the Spring of 1989, Madonna released her then most ambitious and creative album of her career. It is now 10 years later and Like A Prayer (Sire) still shines among the best pop records of the last two decades. Every song from the frank &quot;Express Yourself&quot; to the bittersweet &quot;Promise To Try&quot; to the hountingly beautiful &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; remains as fresh and inventive. This album stands out majestically when all the other other divas at the time, were carelessly churning out disposable, producer driven dance duds. It's pretty obvious why Madonna outlasted them all. And we are lucky to still have the poetically reigning queen of pop among us.
B000056PWV|5.0|&quot;Rear Window&quot;  was the first Hitchcock film I ever saw.   Fabulous!
B000002HB4|4.0|Chuck Berry meets the Ramones. The Rolling Stones on fast-forward. The Faces with a southern-rock twist. You get the idea. These guys didn't last too long, but they churned out some of the best guitar-driven rock'n'roll in a long time. Dan Baird delivers his quirky lyrics with a heavy twang, while Baird &amp; fellow guitarist Rick Richards show they can play good old-fashioned heavy rock'n'roll with the best of them. True, the songs began to sound the same after a while, but what a sound it was. Their repertoire was limited, but tracks like &quot;Keep Your Hands to Yourself&quot;, &quot;Battleship Chains&quot;, &amp; &quot;Mon Cheri&quot; are worth the price of the CD in themselves.
6304119046|5.0|This is the movie that you must see!  The drama and intrigue of this classic centers around a man - and his single dying word.  Charles Foster Kane is an incredible character of power and ultimate misery.  If you are a fan of movies at all - you have to experience Citizen Kane.  It simply is the Godfather of all dramas to come.
B00000099Y|1.0|If you're reading this, I FOOLED YOU!! I only put down one star so you'd stop at it. I give this album 10 stars. It's designed for deep thinkers or people that don't mind researching stuff. The songs have VERY deep meaning, and are very artistic.<br />Song 46+2 has such deep definition that you may end up pondering it for weeks. When I figured it out, I ended up looking through 4 biology books. I mean face it-the song got me curious. I ended up learning a lot about molecular biology in the process, which ALSO had a position in the song's meaning. But explaining this one would take pages. I for one have seen reports on 46+2 that stretch beyond 10 pages.<br />This particular Tool album has some strange essence to it- it kinda throws you into a strange 'world' so to speak. When you listen to the songs, your mind voids and wanders in sequence to the songs and the way they're presented. It's like the album brings out your unconscious mind. One of the songs (for me) was a stimulus on a certain memory that hadn't popped up in about 8 years. Specifically, it was Cesaro Summability.<br />My personal favorite was Stinkfist. And after I saw the video, I just loved it even more. Everything about Stinkfist is just awesome. It's my favorite Tool song and video, with Prison Sex coming in 2nd.<br />I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes music with REAL meaning, rather than music that has such surfaced lyrics you could decipher the meaning by looking at the title. Undertow and AEnima (I wish I knew how to type that Greek AE letter. Maybe someone can tell me??) have opened up my mind and given me a new outlook on the world.<br />Well I've been rambling on for quite a while. I don't count on many people reading this review, as there are already hundreds of them here. I just wanted to share my thoughts...<br />Oh yeah, I thought that 1-star review by the 8-year old dork was HILARIOUS! Even if he is 8, what kind of idiot compares Tool to Christina and BRITNEY SPEARS for crying out loud??<br />Man, sumb peepol arr so stoopid, eh? >:- 
B000056K04|4.0|YES..its different..but its a great album!!!..no clue why so many people seem to hate it..definitely worth buying!! i love it...
B0000026KQ|4.0|Don't get me wrong, Guitar Shop has some great stuff on it. &quot;Where Were You&quot; is worth the four stars alone. However, it also has some not-so-great stuff. The voice on some of the songs can get fairly annoying, and I must say it is a bit overproduced. And it has practically no bass at all-in fact, the bass player isn't even part of the band (if there IS a bass player.) <br />Guitar Shop has some great stuff on it, but for Jeff's best work get &quot;You Had It Coming&quot; &quot;Blow By Blow&quot; or &quot;Wired.&quot;
B00004Y62T|1.0|If you like a movie which has no story line and drags on for ages then this is the film for you. Honestly I have to say it was the longest 2 and half hours i have spent watching a film. All it is about is a young boy who wants to be something he's not. He will willingly kill to get what he wants and thats about it. Exciting? no way!
B000058T5E|5.0|You Had It Coming has melodies as good as Blow by Blow, funk as good as Wired, and techno even better then Who Else. <br />Take the song Dirty Mind. It brings back the funk we all love from Wired. Then there's Nadia, which has a to-die-for melody. Suspension has Jeff doing one of the things he does best-slow, ballad type songs. Roy's Toy has a great beat to it, and Earthquake rocks. Left Hook proves Jeff hasn't gone out to pasture yet. Listen to the fade out-who says he can't do that anymore? Rosebud is great funk, like &quot;Thelonius&quot; from Blow by Blow, or &quot;Hip-Notcha&quot; from Who Else. Great stuff!
B000000WA4|5.0|Bigger,better,faster,more--&quot;Mellon Collie&quot; is every significant musical and stylistic innovation of nineties rock times ten.Coming on the heels of thier global smash&quot;Siamese Dream&quot;,and following much public sniping over who's playing what and who's in charge,the Smashing Pumpkins retrenched into the studio,mustered unprecedented levels of creativity and stamina,bolstered thier team with production wizes Flood and Alan Moulder,and set forth to steam-roll all opposition.What blasted forth is quite possibly the grandest epic-double-disc blow-out in rock history.Clocking in at at around eleven-and-a-half-hours,and with one-hundred and thirty-nine tracks(not really),the album sprawls all over the map,from churning,grinding,industrial-age monstrosities(&quot;Jellybelly&quot;,&quot;Tales Of A Scorched Earth&quot;,&quot;Bodies&quot;),sweeping,elaborate operettas(&quot;Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans&quot;,&quot;Thru The Eyes Of Ruby&quot;),haunting,minor-key laments(&quot;Thirty-Three&quot;,&quot;To Forgive&quot;,&quot;Stumbeline&quot;),and jaunty new-wave pop oddities(&quot;1979&quot;,&quot;Lily[My One And Only]&quot;),to flat-out rockers(&quot;Zero&quot;,&quot;X.Y.U.).That doesn't even mention &quot;Tonight,Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot;,two classic singles that garnered the Pumpkins a slew of awards in '96.This album's length may seem a bit daunting to the uninitiated at first,but trust me,give it a chance.Wait until you have about two hours of free time,go in your room,turn out the lights,strap on your headphones and dive in feet first.I guarentee you within moments this'll be on your top ten.
B000006UNG|5.0|Its predecessor IT'S MY LIFE was fairly commercial, with little trace of the departure from the New Romantic mould that Talk Talk's label had intended for them.  Its successor SPIRIT OF EDEN was firmly in experimental/progressive territory; the band's label viewed it as commercial suicide.<br />In between we have this beautifully recorded crossover album, crammed with guest musicians of the highest quality: Steve Winwood's organ intrudes in several tracks.  Danny Thompson's superb string bass guides the opening track through its graceful course.  And former Brand X percussionist Morris Pert bangs around on several tracks.<br />It was the band's most successful album, and Mark Hollis's welcome return from a two-year absence, some of it spent in heroin addiction.  The piano-driven riff of the preceding single, 'Life's What You Make It', (also on this album), was one of 1986's summer highlights.  The drum beat may be a little too ponderous, but that's the 80s for you.<br />I was unaware of Talk Talk until after they had broken up.  Personally, I believe that this album and both its successors, SPIRIT OF EDEN and LAUGHING STOCK, are must-haves.  I cannot recall another band which so deliberately spat in the face of commercial success and went headlong in the direction of committed, serious and obscure music.
0790731452|5.0|I am a huge Tim Burton fan.He is my favorite film-maker,and I treasure every inch of celluloid that his fertile,wonderful imagination has produced.Several of his films have provided defining moments in my life(I don't think I could've made it through middle school without &quot;Pee-Wee's Big Adventure&quot;,and I distinctly remember actually winning a job after showing up at the interview profoundly inspired by Ed Wood's can-do brovado).I felt I had to qualify this review by first stating that,as &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; is probably a bad place to start for those who don't feel the connection to Burton's work that I do.Looking at the film from an objective,critical standpoint(nearly impossible for me),it's easy to see why some might find it a bit,uh,well,underwhelming.It's based on a rather obscure soarce,a series of trading cards from,I think,the fifties or something and it plays out like one huge,massively produced in-joke.It's one that will rigidly polarize it's viewers:you'll either think it's the best thing sinse &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;,or you'll angrily demand your money back from the video store.I am,of coarse,in the former category.I think this film is hysterically funny,and a spot-on satire of over-blown sci-fi epics to boot.All of it's all-star cast,including Pierce Brosnan as a condescending scientist,Sara Jessica Parker as a vacuous fashion reporter,Micheal J. Fox  as a long-suffering cable news correspondant(and Parker's husband),and Annette Bening as a ditzy but well-meaning new-age crystal-gazer,are all great,but the stand-outs are Jack Nicholson,in two roles(as the President and Bening's sleazy Vegas philanthroper husband),and Natalie Portman as the shrewd First Daughter(she has the second-best line of the film:&quot;I guess it wasn't the dove!&quot;).But who really steals the show is the priceless Sylvia Syndney,who plays Lukas Haas'  grandmother,she runs away with the film every time she delivers a flawlessly timed line-&quot;They blew up congress!&quot;,&quot;I think it's my music...&quot;,among other gems.But,really the entire film is full of classic moments for those particularly receptive to them,and this is highly recommended for you.All others,well,like I say,I understand if you don't get it.
B00000IAU3|5.0|While her voice sounds slightly like Sarah's, and her song themes are along the same lines as Alanis's, Dido's album, No Angel, has a unique style--one that Dido should be proud and happy to have her name attached to.<br />This album offers the listener a variety of songs, making it one that is consistently getting slipped into my CD player for a long drive or a long day of work.  Her songs are captivating--her music is moving and her lyrics are interesting.  I appreciate an artist who keeps my interest.<br />Boring, redundant and uncreative sounds and words do not sit well with me.  Dido's No Angel provides refuge from all those negatives that are so frequently found in &quot;pop&quot; music.  <br />Excellent job, Dido!
0553573403|5.0|For those who relish complex stories and who do not complain whenever they have to make the excruciating effort of reading more and more books as a story advances, &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; will simply delight them.<br />In this first installment of A Song of Fire and Ice series, George R.R. Martin demonstrates that he masters a sense of organization and complexity that not many authors can boast of. Indeed, Martin's is one very complex story, which could probably compare only with Jordan's Wheel of Time on that level. Yet, Martin's fine skills at organizing the story are such that it is but impossible to get lost in the story.<br />For those who might be fed up with far-fetched ideas of wizardry and magic, the story will not disappoint you on that level. So far, only a small spec of magic is introduced in the story. Instead, what makes the story so interesting is the development of many interesting characters and their various houses, some forming alliances and others plotting against each other.<br />Yet, what strikes me the most of this first installment is how Martin will constantly go against what most readers will think or at least hope. I mean, and please don't hate me for that, but even in this first installment some major characters that readers will quickly get to like will die. And I almost forgot, don't expect Martin to pull some impossible unlogical trick to save your dear character; it just won't happen, and I for one am thankful for that. Too many authors will use some &quot;Deux Ex Machina&quot; tricks to save some favorite characters who had been placed in an uncomfortable yet unreasonable spot in the first place. Well, it just won't do for Martin.<br />So, for those who liked series such as The Wheel of Time or The Sword of Truth, this first installment of this new series will not disappoint you. A Song of Fire and Ice promises to be the next big series we will cherish and so eargerly every next book to come.
B000002OMN|5.0|Yes, this is the best. Bat out of hell two is certainly the one album I've spent most time listening to. Ever since it came out (I was ten years then by the way) I've been going around singing along to Rock and Roll Dreams, Objects in the Riew Wiew Mirror or Out of the Frying Pan. Back then I really didn't understand what the guy was singing about, but I didn't really matter. As I learned to understand the english language, the songs just got more and more amazing. I'ts a shame so few people in Sweden have learned to appreciate the greatness of Jim Steinman!
0880389052|5.0|I bought Homeland two days ago and finished it this morning. It kept me glued to my seat. The main character, Drizzit Do'Urden is the coolest elf ever. Great book!
B000001FI7|5.0|The scenario: It's 1994 and I'm stationed overseas in the military and a friend of mine says to me &quot;Yo man, listen to this group from England called Portishead.&quot; &quot;Since you're a hip hop fan, you'll probably like this stuff.&quot; He pops it into the stereo  and plays &quot;Strangers&quot;. Instantly the sampled breakbeat and lingering bassline overwelms me. It was the first time I heard of such a thing as &quot;Trip Hop&quot;. Since I was already a fan of rap music and breakbeats, I became infatuated with Portishead from that point forward. This is perfect head noddin' music while your're driving down the road on a summer evening, winding down after a hard day's work, having candlelight dinner with your girlfriend, or just coming home from a club/rave. Beth Gibbons's vocals compliment the beats with perfection. This music isn't meant to get you worked up and ready for battle like a Mobb Deep or DMX album. It's downtempo/chillout music with a blend of hip hop beats, vocals, and dark sometimes eerie melodies. Would I recommend it? Of course I would.
0064407667|1.0|The author has tried, unsecessfully tried to emulate the writers like J.K. Rowling and Enid Blyton. They constantly use words which are dificult for kids to understand, and then feel that they need to explain it. (not very well.) The plot and characters aren't bad, but the author is patronising to younger childeren in the way he structures and writes the book. I do not recommend it too anybody of any age. A bad read
B00004Z459|5.0|I heard this cd just days after breaking up with my girlfriend.  I could truly relate to many of these songs and they have helped me deal with this because they are so true.  I would have to say that &quot;In the end&quot; is my favorite song because it is actually what i went through.  Every song on this cd has real emotion.  A must buy!
0385335482|4.0|I finished this book last week and I absolutely love it. I could easily identify with Rebecca just from the ways she rationalized the enormous amount that she spent on sales (who can resist sales, really?). I like Rebecca's character because the only flaw in her character is she just doesn't have control when it comes to shopping; otherwise, she's a really good person (from the outrageous reasons that she gave to delay paying her bills ... for god sake, she can't even lie! she has to be a good person). Also I think the storyline is pretty good except for one thing: what're the chances of a SINGLE girl who's making entry-level salary and in debts (a few thousand pounds) has 2 of Britain's most avilable bachelors (with multimillions assets) have eyes on her at the same time?
B00003CXE6|3.0|I am really really surprised at all these amazing reviews that this movie is getting, and am just baffled that the academy would nominate this for best movie.  It's basically Braveheart with no plot, no interesting characters or plot twists, and even MORE historically inaccurate.  The action scenes weren't as impressive either.  I mean... this movie was GOOD, but nothing more.  This movie had no dramatic effect, and I predicted the entire movie during the first ten minutes.  The ending was boring, the scene where his wife and son died was stupid because you never even saw the characters before this took place, therefore how is it supposed to move you?  And why the hell were there so many damn british accents in ancient Rome?  The main character Maximus is not a great actor either, why he was nominated for best actor is just beyond me.  Basically, there were only two good points about this movie -- The direction WAS good and impressive, but Ridley Scott just tries to make a movie good with needless violence which is why Hannibal was no good.  The second good point was the action, there was a lot of it, but there just was no real EMOTION behind it like in Saving Private Ryan or Braveheart, so this movie really did nothing for me.  To me it was just two or three hours of somewhat entertaining violent action sequences.  If you want to see the movie that SHOULD win best picture this year, go out and see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
B0000062GE|5.0|It is obvious that Stabbing Westward's music has greatly grown and matured ever since their original CD; &quot;Ungod&quot;. &quot;Wither Blister Burn &amp; Peel&quot; was a great follow-up, but this album is the band's best work. I was actually very surprised to read many fan's reviews, saying that this album wasn't as carefully put together and didn't have the same energy or power behind it.<br />If you listen closely to the lyric's of the songs, the general flow of the music, and the way the songs are structured, you will notice that the album is essentially written in four parts. Similar to the rest of Stabbing Westward's work, the CD focuses on relationships and where they go wrong. The other theme present is how we mess up in life and how to get back on the right track. A very depressing album.<br />The first four songs focus on how we mess up in life and the terrible, threatening mistakes we make. &quot;Darkest Days&quot; is a great opening song, makes great use of the band's percussion and Chris Hall's emotional lyrics. Second is &quot;Everything I Touch&quot;, a powerful song discussing how he ruins everything he gets involved with. Afterwards are (in my opinion) the two best songs on the album. &quot;How Can I Hold On? (Dog Attack)&quot; is a fast-paced gothic/industrial tune that gets the adrenaline going. The follow-up is &quot;Drugstore&quot;, the most emotionally-charged song on the CD, talking about drug abuse and the influence that people have on each other.<br />The second portion of the album deals with relationships, specifically the ones that are torn apart by lies, disagreements, etc. &quot;You Complete Me&quot; is really the only upbeat song in this section, and pretty much on the album as well. &quot;Save Yourself&quot;, &quot;Haunting Me&quot;, and &quot;Torn Apart&quot; are more adrenaline-pumping songs, all strong and fast-paced.<br />Then, sitting right in the middle is the portion to listen to when you're feeling down, when you've reachedthat low point in life that's hard to get out of. &quot;Drowning&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot; are slow-moving, but no less emotional than anything else on here. But the real standout's in this section are &quot;Sometimes It Hurts&quot; and &quot;Desperate Now&quot;.<br />Wrapping the album up is the most emotion-filled, most powerful portion of the entire album. The theme behind it is standing behind your beliefs in life. The pure anger and violence in &quot;When I'm Dead&quot; and &quot;The Thing I Hate&quot; makes them some of the best industrial tunes out there. &quot;On Your Way Down&quot; uses skillful guitar playing and lyrics, which refer to how celebrities screw people over in life to get to the top. The closing track on the album, &quot;Waking Up Beside You&quot; is enough to bring a lot of people to tears. This song rises above the majority of the rest of the band's work.<br />Although the album is split into four general themes and sections, it also has the capability to flow through as one theme, a strange talent that is rare to find in a CD and a band itself. I strongly recommend this, and anything else by Stabbing Westward, to anyone who likes hard rock and industrial.
B0000025ZF|4.0|I expect that everyone who's listened to this album, or is a fan of Roger Waters, is at least somewhat familiar with the music of Pink Floyd.  Therefore, most of them compare &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; to Waters masterworks like &quot;Final Cut&quot; and &quot;The Wall.&quot;  I won't.  I'm just going to write this for the music lover who's been directed to this page by a &quot;best of&quot; list of friend's recommendation.<br />Most importantly, &quot;Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; is a concept album in the ultimate sense.  This means that it is not actually twelve different tracks that go together -- it means that the entire album is really one long track, telling one story.  It includes a multitude of sound effects and imbedded dialogue to enhance the narrative.  Many musical chords are used repeatedly in various parts of the album to reinforce the cohesiveness.  It is virtually impossible to appreciate &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; without sitting down and listening to it all the way through at least a dozen times.  Like all of Roger Waters' work, he requires his listener to put as much thought into the album as he did.<br />Minor problems do crop up.  For instance, it's a godsend that the lyrics are included with the album, as well as the dialogue, because some of it is quite difficult to understand with no outside reference.  Then there's the usual problem with Waters work: if you don't pay full attention, you WILL NOT &quot;GET IT.&quot;  I can't put it any more clearly.  Waters demands your full participation.  Also, some portions of the music don't run quite as deep as the lyrics.  This makes the album as a whole seem shallower than it really is....  And sometimes, if you're not in a patient mood, some parts seems to drag on. This may be due to Roger not having the safety net of collaborators during the composition process.  (This was his first solo album, after all. So he's allowed to be a little shaky.)<br />The execution of the music is flawless, though!Mr. Waters is an accomplished bassist.  The Legendary Eric Clapton is lead guitarist (and if you don't know Floyd, I have to assume that you must know at least SOMETHING by Clapton...) Michael Kamen plays the piano and conducts the London Philharmonic Orchestra.  So despite showing signs of lacking in musical composition, the performance of the material gives it an operatic quality.  Roger Waters himself gives a go-for-broke vocal performance that quickens the strain of the protagonist's conflict.<br />I think the main reason that this album is a bit obscure (except among true Floyd and Waters fans) is that there really are no tracks that could be marketed as radio singles.  As I've mentioned before, the entire album is the only track on the disc.  But for posterity's sake, I'll say that there are a few cuts that might have made excellent singles.  &quot;Sexual Revolution,&quot; &quot;Every Stranger's Eyes,&quot; and the title track may have made it... But stripped of the album's context, they do in fact lose some of their power.<br />What really kills me is that I can't think of a single other artist to whom I can compare this album.  It has a quite different sound from classic Pink Floyd, and Roger Waters' later work is even a little more audience-accessible than &quot;Pros and Cons.&quot;  I'd say that it could possibly be just summed up as a &quot;country rock opera.&quot;  I do think that you would not enjoy this album quite as much unless you first go back and investigate some of Pink Floyd's earlier work.  &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Final Cut&quot; are absolute essentials in Roger Waters ouevre, and listening to them would help considerably in appreciating this.  If you like those, then you'll probably appreciate this album a bit more.  Definitely don't make this your first Roger Waters purchase. &quot;Amused to Death&quot; is a much more polished work.  If you want a good overview of his work, try his &quot;In the Flesh&quot; live album.  Then move onto &quot;Pros and Cons.&quot;<br />Now, if you do happen to be a Pink Floyd fan, and you're reading this review, you already know what a brilliant lyricist Mr. Waters is.  Since this was his first solo album, it's easy to see his attempts to make his own musical mark, and that's probably what detracts a bit from this.  But I can say that it is a very satisfying work, and anyone with a deeper sense of sophistication would certainly give &quot;Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; a thumbs up.
B00003CXBK|2.0|When I first heard about this movie I was very interested in seeing it. Namely because everyone was telling me how epic it was. Well I consider myself a huge anime fan so I wanted to check it out. What I found was however was a movie riddled with enladen old messages like &quot;women's rights&quot; and &quot;peace making skills&quot;. This DVD might have been made in Japan, but its messages are fully American-which makes it absolutely boring.
B000002UAF|5.0|This album is by far the best from the first era of the Beatles. Formed by thirteen Lennon/McCartney compositions, it's full with joyful songs that can remove you with their musical perfection and accomplishment. But again, just like in the two first Beatle albums, you can be amazed by finding a great variety of musical styles, and the sparkling brilliancy of two composers and four musicians that were simply &quot;meant to play with each other&quot;.<br />The highest point of the Beatles' creativity on their first era is inside this LP, and it was suprisingly coincident with the highest point of their popularity in the whole world. &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; was not only the title of a song and this album, but also of a major success movie, a very creative Richard Lester comedy based in the true lives of the members of the band.<br />So the success and the quality of the movie, where The Beatles began to show their critical side against certain society rules and their particular sense of humour, showed the world that they were not only meant to be a simple rock'n'roll band like some others might have thought. They were about to change the world with their part of the work: the music. This movie, and its respective LP (released on CD in its British version, not the American soundtrack which only contained seven Beatle numbers) was the definitive prove of that fact, setting fire to an already burning massive success that change every single part of people's lives.<br />Musically, the album is a repertory of pop perfection. John Lennon dominates it as the major composer and lead singer, driving it mainly into fast numbers, always energetic, making you think that the only way The Beatles were happy was to dance. The opening track &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; begins by struggling you with its impressive opening electric guitar chord, and later summes you into the deepest musical trance full of speed, with its up-tempo structure and piano solo. Life is fast, so thetruth can be said in a few minutes; &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; is an acoustic masterpiece, with a John playing harmonica and singing pretty well. His other compositions are also worth noting: &quot;If I Fell&quot; is an emotional ballad with great harmonies by Paul; &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; is another cheerful filler; and the second side is a great collection of John's early songwriting: &quot;Anytime At All&quot;, the perfect B-side to &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;; &quot;I'll  Cry Instead&quot; (my own favourite), a short but amazing love lament about a love that's lost, but with an important quote of resignation and irony; &quot;When I Get Home&quot;, interesting because of the harmonies and the guitar work; &quot;You Can't Do That&quot;, showing the lead guitarist John singing another love story and playing an amazing solo, and &quot;I'll Be Back&quot;, a tender acoustic ballad sung in two and three-part harmonies. Paul also shines: &quot;And I Love Her&quot; is an all-time acoustic classic, a ballad that has aged very well; &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; was already a big hit before the album came out, counting with a terrific lead vocal by Paul and a great George guitar solo; and &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; is lirically the best song on the LP, an interesting point of view of the ending of a relationship, looking at it behind, as it now was the future. John said it was a good song.<br />George doesn't write any songs here, but his voice can be heard on &quot;I'm Happy Just To Dance With You&quot;, the song that resumes the spirit of the LP. He shines as a lead guitarist on &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, and his backing vocals are always welcomed. Ringo drummed perfectly joining the almost-always cheering songs, and his work with the bongos on &quot;And I Love Her&quot; was great. <br />Here you will find the happy face of The Beatles. There were happy to be dancing and to be the biggest band in the world. Hereyou can hear them enjoying it, and be removed by that sparkling energy. If you like that teen spirit and charming sense of humour that The Beatles had on their first era, buy and hear this.You won't regret it.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Moking Bird is a work of art utterly exceptional; a timeless classic, and one of the most beautiful books ever written.
6305971099|2.0|Set one year after \\"Halloween 4\\", Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is in a children's psychiatric hospital, and she seems to have a psychic connection to her uncle Michael Myers. On hand is Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), who wants Jamie to reveal where Michael is. But for some reason Jamie can't speak, and Loomis wants to use her as bait to trap Myers. That sets the tone for the rest of the film, which isn't saying much: Myer's mask looks too different, routine unimaginative murders, no real scares, and the introduction of a subplot involving a mysterious man dressed in black that goes nowhere. The Myers house here (as in \\"Halloween 4\\") is completely different than in the first two films. Points taken off for the death of plucky Rachel (Ellie Cornell) early in the film. The ending is unsatisfactory, and doesn't really take us anywhere. Thank God this series was rescued nine years later with \\"Halloween H20\\".

0425107469|5.0|Einstein the dog.  What can I say?  He's absolutey The coolest dog.  Koontz has some kind of magic when it comes to animating animals . . . dogs in particular.  That skill was in it's highest form when he wrote about Einstein, the golden retriever.  This story would have been thoroughly entertaining if it was just about the dog.  However, it Is a Koontz novel so there is a *little* mojo going on.  Not interested yet?  What if I told you that a Disney character makes a cameo appearance?  Hmmmmmm.  Do I have your attention now?!  Wondering what on Earth could Possibly make Koontz write in a Disney character?  Lol, get the book.  You Won't be disappointed.  It's the book I got my husband hooked on Koontz with (and he didn't care much for reading before 'Watchers' and 'Dark Rivers of the Heart') and he's just about gone through my entire collection of Koontz novels from 'The Vision' to 'Whispers' to 'Lightning' to 'Twilight Eyes' to 'Dark Rivers of the Heart' to his current read, 'False Memories,' and everything inbetween.  Now that you know I am an avid fan of Mr. Koontz you can rest assured that I tell no lies when I say this is his best book (although 'Dark Rivers of the Heart' runs a Very close second).<br />NOTE:  If you saw the movie please do Not compare it to the book.  The movie is an Awful telling of this story and the main characters are grossly misrepresented (i.e. the movie has the main characters as a mother and a son which Totally goes against the book!).
B00001NFCY|5.0|Before listening to Creed I'm a great fan of Deep Purple and Metallica. After listening to Creed it is now my favourite rock band. Trust me this is one awesome band. All the songs are just great. You won't regret buying this one. It is highly recommended. It's a must buy.
B000005RQT|5.0|I bought my first Purple album which was MACHINE HEAD back in 72 at the age of 9. That was my first Purple experience. I instantly fell in love an began searching out other albums.When I came across In Rock I thought how was Machine Head their biggest seller. This was not only their best recording ever but nobody has ever produced vocals on a hard rock album like Ian Gillan did on this one. He is truley one of the best vocalist in all of music. Just listen to Child In Time an I say no more point proven.Now having this disc totally remastered is something to enjoy. Like the writing on the back of the Purple Mark III album Made IN Europe. Savor these tracks at maximum volume for now is the chance to finally come taste the band.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|&quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, shot by a woman way ahead of her time- Reifenstahl- is actual footage of Adolf Hitler and his masses of orderly followers as they put on displays of power. There is also footage of Hitler giving speeches, in which we ascertain the immediacy and contagiousness of his leadership, as well as his slight femininity (watch how he pushes his hair away from his forehead). More than a historical relic of invaluable worth, this film also captures the pure propaganda tools Hitler employed- massive banners, uniforms, swastikas, huge lines of orderly troops (most of them just out of their teens), great processions and the stern face of the demagogue himself. If you pay close attention you will notice than in a few scenes Hitler's army are marching with shovels instead of rifles. This is because Germany was still abiding by an allied ban enforced against them carrying tools of war- but how interesting that even without them, they carried forth in full formation. Of course when they did again obtain real weapons, they marched on to many victories before their ultimate military defeats. This film is truly an eye-opener of the power and charisma of Hitler and of the early reign of his Nazi forces. You don't have to like the man to see the genious and art in his propaganda and in Reifenstahls' film style.
6304466498|5.0|Spaceballs is perhaps the best Sci-fi spoof of all time. It has already been mentioned that it spoofs Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, but it really spoofs nearly every big Sci-fi movie ever. Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey (&quot;...they've gone to plaid!&quot;) and many more. Some of the best sequences are the &quot;ludicruous speed&quot; scene, the &quot;instant video&quot; scene, and the whole Yogurt part. Mel Brooks plays the spoof of Star Wars' Yoda who is the guardian of the Schwartz and is also heavily into Spaceballs Merchandising, including the Spaceballs flamethrower. (&quot;The kids love this one.&quot;) Rick Moranis, of course, is the Darth Vader spoof, and I have to congradulate the casting department, because Rick Moranis and Darth Vader have to be as close to being polar opposites as you can come. Although I have heard it called unfunny and lame by others, I think it is a very funny movie and deserves to be watched not only by Sci-fi fans, but by anybody looking for a good laugh.
1558908374|3.0|As with the 1961 original, this was a good film only for Cruella.  I am no fan of Glenn Close, but she was perfect in the part.  Disappointed it did not have extras but glad to get it letter box.
B000002UTH|5.0|This CD is excellent.  I was a diehard chili peppers fan since I got Californication, and I gradually bought the older CDs.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, I was afraid it might have a sort of garage-band sound.  But Freaky Styley is crazily funky.  My personal favorites are If You Want Me to Stay (Sly &amp; the Family Stone cover), Jungle Man, American Ghost Dance, and Catholic School Girls Rule.  Anthony's rapping vocal talent is highlighted here, as is Flea's excellent bass work.  But you have to like the whole chili pepper sound, not just their new rock songs, because it is a totally different sound.  If you like funk rock at all, buy this CD!
0345350499|5.0|I'm a big fan of Arthurian legends and so, perhaps, a little prejudiced.  I loved this book because it focused on the women and on the lives of the people.  First Igraine, who in most stories seems nothing more than an object of Uther's obsessive lust.  In this book, she has a character that makes her part of the story even more meaningful.  And I love the perspective of the Lady of the Lake, not a mystical faery creature, but a woman running out of options and trying to preserve her religion against the onslaught of Christianity.  And I loved Morgaine's character.  She suddenly came alive for me when I read this.  No other book (i.e. of T.H. White, Mary Stewart, Stephen R. Lawhead...) was ever the same after I got Marion Zimmer Bradley's Morgaine into my head.  And Guinevere(I won't try to recreate the Welsh spelling Bradley uses from memory!) was a wonderful character as well, thoroughly detestable.  There was a part near the middle of The Mists of Avalon, having to do with a banner, where I had to close the book because I was so mad at her.  Lancelet was well done and his relationships with Arthur, Guinevere and Morgaine give him new dimensions previously unthought of by me.  This is, overall, a fabulous book, with so many wonderful characters.  I hesitate to try and do them justice.  It affected me very much, especially the end.  It weaves so many threads of so many legends together to make a unique tapestry that I know I will never forget.  I would recommend it to anyone.  In fact, I do.
B0000029GA|5.0|this album is definetly a classic.  the production and the lyrics are tight.  the only beef i have is with those haters who say nas fell off on  i am. i am is just as good as this album because the lyrics are better.  just because i am got a little commercial everyone hates on it.  it still is real concious hiphop(it aint the jiggy s!@t).  so stop hatin' on i am.  i bet you if nas was talking about murder all you sellouts would still like him--------------your hearing this from a true underground hiphop head.   YOU DUN KNOW! <br />the bottom line is nas was amazin' on illmatic and he still is amazin'!
630416923X|4.0|I'd recommend this video set without hesitation both to fans or anyone interested in popular culture, music, or just an interesting story.<br />The flow of the entire documentary is much better on the video version than the truncated episodes shown on television.  In this respect, &quot;Anthology&quot; succeeds where the Ken Burns PBS epics fail.  Unlike &quot;Jazz&quot;, where the music is merely a backdrop for the director to comment on the issue of race in America, the focus is squarely on the subject at hand.  Through the story of the Beatles, one gets a good sense of the times -- popular music, politics, the music business, media.<br />The editing is a bit overdone at times and some segments go on a little long to set a mood or to allow a rare track or film clip to play through, but these are fairly minor quibbles.  Fans will rejoice in actually seeing or hearing the material; the uninitiated will be amazed at some of the footage and gain a new, fuller understanding of why the group was a worldwide hit.  The Beatles performances in Washington, DC and on Swedish television, for example, delight with the sheer raw energy the group shows; the wit and candor displayed in the interviews and other assorted appearances are refreshing.  The members of the group come off as interesting, complex individuals -- not exactly the type of thing you would have expected to see in a television documentary.<br />Many hardcore fans may be upset with the exclusion of some subjects from the documentary -- the 'butcher' cover, etc. -- but any project of this type, by necessity, has to eliminate something.  The fundamental question dealt with in the piece deals with how the group developed and evolved.  And this epic video answers the question quite well.
B00000612P|5.0|This was the phrase used by former bandmate Ron Wood in describing both this effort and &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; in the recent &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode featuring Rod Stewart. Given the excesses that plauged Stewart's later career, there's a certain sad irony to that statement. Nonetheless, there's much to admire and celebrate about &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story.&quot; Like Dylan's &quot;Highway 61&quot;, John Mellencamp's &quot;The Lonesome Jubillee&quot;, and The Band's self titled second album, this was a convergence of outstanding material, daring instrumentation, and a sense of purpose among the musicians involved to produce the best music they possibly could. Stewart's ragged but right delivery is irresistable throughout, whether it's applied to his own material (the title track, the country-tinged &quot;Mandolin Wind&quot;, and &quot;Maggie May&quot;, one of the greatest singles ever) or any of the cover stuff (Dylan's &quot;Tommorow is a Long Time, Tim Hardin's &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, and the rollicking &quot;That's All Right, Mama&quot;). Dick Powell's violin, Wood's bass and guitar work, Micky Waller's Charlie Watts-like drumming, and the mandolin work of the mysterious mandolinist from the obscure British folk-rock band Lindisfarne (&quot;His name escapes me at the moment,&quot; claims Stewart in the liner notes) combined to make a a wonderfully unique, folky sound that rocked.  And that's the pity. Stewart's career had a number of highlights and metamorphuses - the shy blues shouter with the Jeff Beck Group, rockin' front man with the Faces, foppish solo artist - but at this stage of his career, Rod the Mod had both popular and critical acclaim. And he basically threw it all away after this.
B0000041DF|5.0|Every time I listen to Martha Argerich's Rach 3, I am dumb founded in dis-belief! This kind of a playing is in-human! No record has ever given me greater pleasure!!
0425107469|5.0|I'm not embarrased to say that &quot;something was in my eye&quot; at the end of the book.  If you are familiar with Koontz' writing style, you'll note that he has a strong affinity for Golden Retrievers and black Labradors.  His main characters are typically strong-willed, silent heroes who choose to live a low-key life, yet are drawn into dilemnas that test their fortitudes. This is the case with Watchers.  This book single-handedly grew my love for Golden Retrievers.  By the end of the novel, you'll honestly wish that there would be a sequel.  I finished the novel for the 10th time, and wistfully closed the book...wishing silently the best for Travis, Nora and Einstein.
B000003CMB|5.0|When I first heard this double album I could not believe a person could actually take the slide guitar to somewhere were it had never been before. I spent years trying to copy Duane's style with very minimal success. He is the Jimi hendrix of slide guitar! It wasn't until years later that I discovered how magnificent he was at playing regular guitar! A truly once in a lifetime talent. I get very emotional listening to this record because of the promise of where Duane was going with his playing. I don't think there would have been another guitar player in the world who could have touched him. I believe this year is also the anniversary of his death in a motorcyle crash. The rest of the band is also a perfect compliment to his playing. How many rock bands had two drummers? How many rock bands had a black drummer in the South during the 60's. What a powerhouse duo with Berry on bass. His playing follows Duane's very closely. He's literaly playing another lead! How much better would Dickey Bett's have become if Duane had lived. Dickey's music is so tight that's it's hard to tell between them at times. Gregg's singing is the perfect match for the band driving rythums and slow ballads. If you've never heard the CD just look at all the  5 star reviews. Also check out the book Midnight Riders. It really gets into what the Allmans were all about, especially who was playing what on this CD. I don't feel this way about any other music that I've ever listened too. It's the only CD that I can play over and over and not get bored with. I'm sure you will feel the same! Skydog lives on!

B00003CXE7|2.0|Having heard so many wonderful things about this film, I expected a lot. I was quite disappointed - great cast but not great acting. I was bored through most of it and not even Russell Crowe was worth watching. He is most brilliant in ROMPER STOMPER! <br />GLADIATOR certainly does not measure up to the great SPARTACUS!!!
B000002VRZ|5.0|Outlaws music is a way of life. It transcends time. If you consider yourself a music listener, and who doesn't, then you owe it to yourself to own at least one Outlaws CD. A greatest hits is a good start. It won't be your last. These Gentlemen can rock, lyricise, harmonize,better than the rest,  and make &quot;Freebird&quot; sound like a guitar excercise. I thank God for the Outlaws! Truly an inspiration every day. Pete Alberts
B000056K04|4.0|DMB's fourth release, &quot;Everyday&quot;, sounds more like a Matthews/Ballard solo record than a DMB release. Missing are the Tinsley violin solos, the Reynolds guitarwork, and most of all the improvisations and jams. However, &quot;Everyday&quot; is still able to shine in its own way. Many of the songs hit a groove and ride it through the whole song (&quot;When The World Ends&quot;, &quot;So Right&quot;, &quot;Everyday&quot;), while others are riff-heavy with tricky time signatures (&quot;I Did It&quot;, &quot;Dreams Of Our Fathers&quot;, &quot;Fool To Think&quot;), reminiscent of the old DMB. &quot;What You Are&quot; is an awful song, stuck in between two gems (&quot;If I Had It All&quot;, the CD's best track, and &quot;Angel&quot;, a slow, bluesy groove song). DMB has changed their sound without selling out- there's still some acoustic guitar and &quot;Everyday&quot; will work well with the old DMB crowds. This will be the CD that puts DMB over the top, while still being able to captivate their core fan base.
B00000JCB2|3.0|I guess I'm only moderately a LB fan. I loved this when it first came out, but then I got tired of it. It's not bad, there's still tracks I love on this album. It has No Sex (I mainly like Aaron Lewis of Staind's part]), and many others like Nookie. Show Me What You Got could have been much better. It's nothing more than him rapping and a redundant beat. I WOULD give it 3.5 if I could, but there's the problem. But I'd say it's closer to a 3. I like it better than Disturbed I'll tell you. I can't say anything about their other albums because I don't own them. There's this really cool part before No Sex, just after an annoying song (Trust?) with the best record scratching DJ Lethal's ever done. I really don't have anything else to say.
6305546789|5.0|I just wanted to inform the public(who probably picked up on it anyway)that there are no refrences to other horror movie's in halloween.Dr.Sam loomis is just as the name hint's at. He is the shape's doctor(not a cop).I Read ........ review and just wanted to set the record strait. All in all the best suspense/slasher movie ever to grace innocent eye's.
B00003CX7L|5.0|Andy's toys striked again!!! <br />This time Woody was toynapped by a toy collector. At the toynapper's hideout, Woody met Jessie the cowgirl, Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete the prospector, all of which the toy collector planned to sell as a set to a museum in Tokyo. <br />At home, the other toys came out with a rescue plan for Woody. The rescue mission will certainly made everyone roar with laughter with all the hilarious things the toys do. <br />A wonderful sequel to Toy Story.
B00000ILDF|4.0|I saw this movie when it first came out on video, and  i have to say that it's actually a pretty good movie. Yes it has holes in it such as the magically appearing egg on the sulaco or the facehugger laying two eggs, when it was made clear in the previous two chapters that it dies after the first egg, or all the holes in script, blame it on the editor or the company because they forced the production crew to hurry it to the screen, thats all there is to it. I liked the mood of the film because it gave the whole film a sort of gothic look and i like that it's what gives the whole entire movie emotion i think. People are stuck in hole of a planet, and so what, they should be happy? i don't think so. The FX's were alright not great, but don't blame production blame the company. If they didn't rush maybe Alien3 might have been better. I'm hoping in the future they release a speceil edition because i heard of lots of deleted, and alternate scenes in this movie so for now ill wait.
B00000J7JO|5.0|One Hot Minute WAS cool but depressing. But it seems that it made me happier to know John was back. And there's not one bad song on this album. There's slow songs like Porcelain.<br />The only flaw is similar sounding songs. Californication and Scar Tissue are close to identical. But it doesn't mean it's bad. They can still be original.<br />And this time there's harder songs like Easily and Parralel Universe. <br />Come on and get the essential stuff.
B0000046KX|5.0|I have all of PB's albums and this is my favorite with Cafe Blue a close second. This album was released in 1992 and is often overlooked, Cafe Blue and Modern Cool are usually mentioned when you think of Patricia Barber albums. This album is very smooth sounding and has a late night jazz club easiness that is very relaxing to listen to. My favorite track is &quot;You Stepped Out Of A Dream&quot;. I also like &quot;Summertime&quot; and &quot;My Girl&quot; which showcase PB's talent of taking someones elses song and putting a new spin on it. If you are a Patricia Barber fan and like Cafe Blue get this album you will not be sorry.
B0000047EC|5.0|I just received &quot;Missouri Sky&quot; yesterday and it is already one of my favorite of Pat's works.  It wiil be one of your favorite too, if you're a fan of Metheny's soft and melodic side.  It's the perfect accompaniment to a romantic dinner or to simply kick back with and de-stress after a long day.
B00004X01U|5.0|Whoever said things get worse with age has obviously not ever heard of Madonna.  After 1998's &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; I didn't think she could get any better, but was I wrong.  From the amazing title track, &quot;Music&quot; to the folk-style &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, Madonna has hit a chord that will set the stage for acts to come for the next decade.  My personal favorite on the album is &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; which will be a favorite to any dance club fanatics out there.  It has dance floor written all over it.  Even the formulaic &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; has a certain edge that could only be found on a Madonna album.  I wasn't a fan of her older music, but her last two albums have made me a fan in an &quot;Impressive Instant.&quot;
630529142X|5.0|'The Waterboy' is chock full of fart jokes, sex jokes, and a hilarious plot. In a way, it is the perfect comedy. Sandler is great, but it is Kathy Bates who really steals the show. Definately recommended to any Adam Sandler fan.
0684853523|4.0|I really liked this book, since I've been writing science fiction and horror for the last ten years and Stephen King is my favorite horror writer.  It didn't blow me away with any writing tips, however.  The autobiography portion of the book, I felt, was much better, only because it featired some anecdotes on how he got some of his ideas as well as his early days as a writer.  <br />So, from a writer's standpoint, I can see why this book is popular, but from the casual reader's standpoint, I'm puzzled.  Over 200 reviews here on Amazon and I'd be willing to bet 175 were from readers, not writers.  That statistic, if it's true (and like I said, I'd be willing to bet it is), says a lot about King.  He can write a book that is basically writing tips and sell it to READERS!  Anyone else would have been laughed at by his publisher.  King is like no other writer on planet Earth.
6305627347|1.0|I can't honestly give any of the episodes on TV five stars except the Hunting episode,  &quot;BIRD!&quot;,   and this movie certainly isn't going to get 5 either.   In my own opinion this movie is nowhere near Blazing Saddles, AIRPLANE!, or The Blues Brothers. I am somewhat in awe it has the high ratings it does.  Have you people seen Blazing Saddles, AIRPLANE! or The Blues Brothers?  How can you put it in the same category?     Anyway, to dissect it.  The intro song is good, I will give it that.  Cartman has a few good lines throughout as usual.  Saddam and Satan are funny.  But for the most part .... for the most part the vulgarity is simply another aspect of a degenerate culture.   You guys can do better and you know it.  Remember the script for AIRPLANE! was written and rewritten for years before it was made into a full fledged B movie.  Please take your time on the next one.  I assume you have enough cash now that you will do it for artistic license and not simply to cash in
B000056H24|3.0|This is a good movie and certainly worth seeing. It may not be as good a rendition as \\"Jesus of Nazereth\\" but you should see it at least. I was a bit disappointed with the wide width of the wide screen version making it sometimes hard to make things out and impossible to read the credits in the beginning of the movie. The length of it makes it difficult to sit through it all in one sitting, and some obvious cameos for the sake of adding a long list of stars to its credit takes away from it a little. The acting and scenery are great and the music is well done. The story holds our interests as it follows the life of Jesus and his trials and tribulations.
B000002GYR|5.0|And it was worth the trip.  It was 1975, I was 24 and on the skids of my first big breakup.  I had this on 8-Track and was listening to it as I drove through the desert in the rain at two in the morning.  When &quot;Martha&quot; came on, I started crying, so much so that I ran off the road and rolled my truck.  I played it for the Trooper who sat with me til the tow truck came, and that big old redneck cop remarked &quot; now that's one sad song&quot;.  The songs distill and preserve the essence of youth: longing, exhileration, the heartbreak that wrenches your soul...  Twenty five years later, it still does it for me.  This is for everyone young and crazy, and for all the rest of us who remember what it was like. Those were days of roses.
B000056K04|5.0|I am a huge DMB fan, and despite all the crap the guys have been getting for their fresh new sound, I found this album to be equal to the bands other work.  Dave's bone-chilling voice is present in the songs &quot;Dreams of Our Father&quot; and &quot;The Space Between&quot; and his lirics are moving.  At first I was disappointed like so many others, but now I can't stop listening to it.  The entire CD is awsome!  Yes, it does lack the band's signature violin and sax, but that does not make it a bad album.  DMB fan or not, get it!
B000056K04|3.0|What happened to songs like Typical Situation, #41 and Two Step? Those songs are so incredibly sexy and complicated that they invoke a sort of altered state. Listening to them is a powerful emotional experience. Listening to the songs on &quot;Everyday&quot; is like listening to any old chartbusting rock band.  I want more.  I expect more.  I want the old DMB back... <br />What I like most about DMB is that they've always seemed to laugh in the face of establishment and simply play music - without caring whether or not they were at the top of the charts.  While this album sounds good, I'm sure, to people who previously didn't like DMB, it lacks the powerful emotion and musical skill present in previous albums.<br />I'll still be there June 9th, at RFK... and I'll continue to wear out all my old DMB albums. And yes, I will even renew my WAREHOUSE membership...  but I really do hope that the band returns to their old style.  If they were having a difficult time becoming inspired, they should have just waited until the magic returned - however long it took.

0380973464|5.0|I've only read a handful of novels in the last ten years that I would give five stars, but I'm not hesitating for an instant here.  Cryptonomicon is absolutely amazing.  It sucked me in and kept me absorbed from start to finish (and at 900+ pages, that's saying something).  Having said that, though, I will proceed to complain about it.  You could start with the women characters, who are entirely flat.  Besides Amy, none of them are interested in anything except collecting furniture and using sex (or the lack of it) for emotional blackmail.  And even Amy is completely incomprehensible.  One could, I suppose, forgive him for making her a cipher--that is after all, the theme of the novel.  But she comes off more like a 90's techno-geek's version of Mae West, a fantasy, takes on whatever shape Stephenson needed her to for the mood he was in.  I never could understand why Randy was so in love with her.  Since I'm one of the (probably)(relatively) small number of women interested in this novel, I'd guess that's not a problem to most readers.  And Stephenson's women are no worse with 90% of the male characters created by women authors.  It's just disappointing--the male characters are SO well-written.<br />But my main gripe, far more irritating than the women, is Stephenson's inability to leave anything out.  I swung between awe at his verbal prowess and irritation at his editor's lack of guts on nearly every page, sometimes within the same paragraph.  Stephenson's ability to turn a phrase, spin an image, see ordinary objects in some entirely new, bizarre way, is simply astonishing.  But sometimes it's also just plain old tedious.  There are multi-page asides on everything from pipe organs to dust devils, interesting ideas that are carried to rococo extremes lasting for pages.  If he (Stephenson) had been anywhere within range when I tried to read Randy's 18-page monotype trip report while supervising my 3-year-old and his 4-year-old best friend at a Burger King playland,I would have strangled him.  (and if you thought that sentence was convoluted, trust me, you will hate this book.)  The lengthy asides are fun at the beginning of the book, but by the time you've read 700+ pages, you're ready to find out what happens.<br />But still I'd say to almost anyone:  read it.  It sucks you in, it makes you think (and laugh!), it's heaven on earth if what you want is an intelligent, interesting (make that fascinating) read.  If the mere heft of it doesn't turn you off and its central theme (untangling cryptic information of every conceivable type, from military intelligence to the strange ways of the human heart) interests you at all, dig in, you won't be sorry.  But if you want a quick, easy read that you can squeeze in between diaper changes, fair warning:  this one will send you right round the bend.
B00001ZWTS|4.0|This film is about a sharp shooting cowboy (Will Smith)and his scientist partner. The work as a team to try to save the world. This film is full of action, suspense and fall over laughter.
B000056K04|2.0|Very disappointing.  Starts out spunky, but fades quickly into mediocrity.  Perhaps new fans may enjoy it, but those of us familiar with everything before Crash should probably avoid this.  Also, I was VERY disappointed that Grey Street didn't make the cut.  Shame on you Dave!
B00004TJJZ|3.0|It was funny at parts and exciting at parts but it really doesn't keep you attention that well, I have seen better movie but than again I have seen worse. If you enjoy Science-Fiction/Alien movies you would enjoy it because the story line is quite far out. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones did do a good acting job though.
B00000HZFH|5.0|I am upset that I only discovered Built To Spill a couple of years ago. They (along with King Crimson) are my current favorite band, and I don't see anyone taking their place in my heart in the near future... &quot;Keep It Like A Secret&quot; is simply one of the most amazing albums I have ever heard. It grows (and grows and grows) on you. &quot;Time Trap&quot; is unbelieveable. On second thought, I'm not going to single out songs. The whole album is a mind-blower. Buy it, or remain lame.
B00000IB4D|5.0|It seemed as though Sanana tested the waters with his self-titled debut, offering a radio ready hit in Evil Ways and gaining international attention from their firey Woodstock performance in '69. With affirmation that this direction was eagerly accepted by the listening masses, Santana relentlessly opened full fire with Abraxas and the aptly titled 3rd album Santana 3. These first 3 albums represent the first wave of a tour de force musical entity that had much more passion and ingenuity than had been fully disclosed up to this point and there becomes an enormous leap in scope, scale and depth from Santana 3 to Welcome (his 5th). The catalyst lies in the splendid 4th album called Caravanserai. This launched the second wave of musically mature compositions that were now more than just songs. These new pieces became alive and dimensional, truly pushing the envelope from where they had been before. Caravanserai showed a more instrumental Santana with their latin-rock flavors merging shades of jazz in a way that is exclusive to Santana. No sound-alikes here. Truly musical pioneers in a genre all their own. Then the Welcome album arrived. Almost as if Santana had found his musical sanctuary and was ready to invite us to the house-warming. This is the finest piece of work Santana has ever produced. His paradigm, representing the crest of their second wave of musical offerings. This was followed by a beautiful album entitled Borboletta. A must have to complete the &quot;second wave&quot; period of Santana although other great works including artists John McLaughlin and Alice Coltrane continued to contribute to this most expressive period. Subsequent waves continue to leave us excellent quality work in its' wake to enjoy. The direction shifted mainstream, but Santana is so individual that one cannot use sell-out in association with his work. &quot;Commercially more appealing&quot; perhaps. Welcome is not commercially appealing and that is sad in itself. I am glad its' creation and the release  of this gem were of a time when music was an artform, not a commodity. A sign of the pathetic times we live in. If you have Abraxas, Santana 3, Caravanserai, Welcome and Borboletta you have the 5 finest and most important pieces of work not only from this master musical icon, but in the history of recorded popular music.
B00004Z459|5.0|I heard this album right after i broke up with my girlfriend.  The song &quot;In the end&quot; was exactly how i was feeling.  The rest of the album is great and i could really relate to this cuz it most of the songs seemed to deal with the feelings i was dealing with.
6304510861|2.0|I wonder when I'll ever understand any other David Lynch film than 'The Straight Story'. 'Lost Highway' is a very typical Lynch film: lots of alternative filming and effects, lots of interesting music - it's often like one long music video, really - and lots of beautiful Patricia Arquette. But the story, hmmm... is as usual not for people with normal IQs.
B000002UAU|3.0|This Beatles recording was no doubt groundbreaking. The record itself brought albums to the forefront in the rock music world. The creativity of the music was very high for its time. The different textures that each song brings is fairly stupendous. Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite and A Day In A Life are perfect examples with the surreal organ effects. Even George Harrison's song Within Without You is a pretty good composition with all the sitars and special effects.<br />However, some of the songs are just a bit too giddy or in the case of She's Leaving Home too depressing. Is this last song really what Rock N Roll is all about? Where Paul McCartney could compose a well structured song, the style is just sooooo bland. The Ringo sung, With A Little Help From My Friends does fit the drummers easy going personality. However, the tone is so mamby pamby that my impression is.... how pathetic is this? Joe Cocker's version adds some badly needed oomph and emotion which greatly improves upon the original version. Getting Better is not exactly that much better especially with the overly simple instrumental support.<br />If you love the Beatles, you are probably best off ignoring my comments and just buying this CD. It did start an album revolution and I will admit its creativity deserves some merit. More open minded fans and those who are non or casual fans may want to take an open perspective and not just love everything because everyone else declares this record as so reverred. I greatly prefer the White Album, Abbey Road, Yesterday And Today, and a few other records of the Fab Gang to this as the songs on these releases have a more consistent instrumental support and a more captivating style from song to song. Keeping that in mind, you make the call.
B00002E285|5.0|'Pink Floyd The Wall' succeeds in putting three different artforms together in a symbiotically beautiful way. Pink Floyd's spectacular music, Alan Paker's film, and Gerald Scarfe's animated drawing.<br />There are so many details and possible interpretations in this film that it is not enough to just watch it once. After ten times, you will still discover new aspects of this historical piece of art. And every single time you watch it, you will still be amazed.<br />It is simply unique. See it!
0446677450|5.0|Coffee in the morning, cold water thrown on your face, bright lights in your eyes, and this book are some of the greatest things to wake you up.

One of the most informative books I have ever picked up.
6302293553|4.0|'The Holy Grail' is less consistent and more slapstick than 'Life Of Brian'. It's more like a series of sketches linked together by facts'n'fun from British history.<br />Highly entertaining as always, far out, sometimes provoking, and certainly politically incorrect. But that's exactly what makes 'The Holy Grail' a very funny, respectless film!
0375501851|5.0|I must confess that I wasn't sure what to expect. There had been so much hype about this debut novel. I picked it up more out of curiosity than anything. By page two I was hooked. <br />ZS has gathered together a fascinating array of diverse characters. We have the sad figure of Archibald Jones who opens the novel trying to escape from life and does the same for much of the novel. He marries the younger and beautiful Clara Bowden who is escaping from her past. Her considerable front teeth have been lost following an unforunate encounter with a tree and a motor scooter. <br />Archie's lifelong friend is Samad Ick-Ball whose marital decisions are made by way of wrestling matches. These four produce the three children whose lives take up much of the rest of the novel. The developing issues of racism, sexism and an experimental mouse (c) keep the novel moving at a fast pace full of wit, pathos and dental similies. But above all it is the characters. Not a pretty bunch. Not a pretty novel. But a definite must read.<br />She had also created a new nown for the English language. Chalfenism. If you want to discover its meaning then you will need to read the book.
B000058983|5.0|this is an essential purchase for any collection. it is one of my  very favorite albums. this reissue comes with some bonus tracks. the single of your mind and we belong together and laughing stock, which appeared after the album's release , is simply essential, eerie, and very underrated. johnny echols' guitar solo that concludes the former is one of the great moments, instrumentally speaking, in the history of this classic american band. the lyrics of both tracks are superb as usual. i do wonder is a bouncy , breezy number that shows listeners more of the supper club, lounge jazz side of the group. the studio banter offers us glimpses of one reason why the band never became as huge as they should have, theres some grouching done by  arthur lee- and the voices seem kind of spaced out.as for the regular album, every track is amazing. every song is of extremely high quality, and they flow into each other superbly. theres no need to make a detailed track by track analysis as you have probably read about it elsewhere and theres just so much you can say about this wonderful record.this album comes with informative liner notes, and the sound quality is excellent . definitely a must, and try their other records as well- particularly the box set called love story , which isn't perfect, but has most of their gems. da capo is another brilliant release, and i think that four sail is underrated, false start is certainly the worst one-however, all love records from 66-70 are at least worthy of investigation.
0767805712|5.0|Finally someone perfects the extremely tedious task of creating a high-quality science fiction movie. Flops in this genre are widespread, but Gattaca is supreme. Thought-provoking and infinitely profound this movie takes a look at a world run by genetecists, people bred to top quality to hone their talents (such as a six-fingered pianist). And always remember, &quot;Right-handed men don't hold it with their left.&quot;

0811826848|5.0|This book is great-remaining interesting from cover to cover.  Quite a bit more detailed than the video series-although naturally a bit repetitive  My only complaint is that the book is quite cumbersome--making normal reading a little difficult-and on some pages the type is hard to read because of the colored background (probably only about ten pages in the whole book)  The book is put together in such a way-that one almost forgets that John is no longer with us (at least in the flesh) I would recommend this book to anyone who has more than a casual interest in the Beatles.
0783225482|5.0|Is there anything director Robert Zemeckis can't do? He has made a ton of films that are worth a view, and Death Becomes Her is absolutely no exception. With an extremely talented cast, stunning visual effects, and hilarious moments, Death Becomes Her is worth a viewing.  Bruce Willis comes out of his action movie front to play a hilarious nerdy plastic surgeon. But it's Meryl Streep and especially Goldie Hawn who steal show. The best lines in the whole film are Goldie: &quot;There's A Hole In My Stomach!!!!!&quot; Bruce: &quot;It's another miracle!&quot; Another great line is Meryl: &quot;Forever Young. Ha! And eternally fat.&quot; Death Becomes Her has a little something for everybody. <br />         Helen (Goldie Hawn) has just lost her fiance Ernest (Bruce Willis) to Broadway bimbo Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep). 7 years later, Helen is fat, and has been evicted from her apartment. Another 7 years later, Madeline &amp; Ernest have been invited to Helen's booksigning party. Helen is MUCH thinner, and Madeline gets suspicious. She goes to see a woman (Isabella Rosellini) who gives Madeline a potion that guarentees eternal youth &amp; beauty. But, Madeline winds up dead, and has a very head turning experience. Helen &amp; Ernest meanwhile have been plotting a way to kill Madeline. When Helen comes by to make sure that Ernest has buried Madeline, she winds up getting shot in the stomach by Madeline. Now both dead, they must get Ernest to drink the potion, so he can keep on repairing their dead bodies. Or they may have to spend eternity together.<br />Overall Grade A+ (10+++)
630416923X|5.0|This is an excellent overview of the phenomena known as Beatlemania.  For those who just &quot;like&quot; the Beatles-it may be too much of a good thing-but for those of us who reached puberty and beyond with the Beatles as our mystical, magical gurus-it's still not enough!The more recent interviews are sparse and Ringo comes across as much more intelligent than the stereotype of him that prevailed during the glory days-an intelligent man without an education.  Nothing shocking-but the skeletons aren't hidden either-as all the Beatles are quite candid.  It would have been nice if Pete Best had been included-at least in the portions that pertained to him--All in all-great entertainment and a nice walk down memory lane.  Although this set is out of print on VHS-it is still available on laser disc if you search--although a laser disc player may be harder to find! (Luckily I already have one)
6305165912|5.0|I love reading all of the highbrow reviews of this movie....  Shut up!!!  Okay, I feel better now.  This movie reminded me of Austin Powers.  The first time I watched it I didn't think much of it.  There are not laugh-out-loud-right-away parts.  But after the movie is over you can't help replaying it in your head and you find yourself quoting the movie.  Then you find yourself watching it again and again and again.  This movie rules.
0767805712|4.0|Science Fiction is often sneered at by the pretentious amongst us. They claim it is mindless escapism and uses fantasy to disguise a lack of quality. &quot;Gattaca&quot; proves these sentiments to be false, once and for all. It is frighteningly believable in its technological and social predictions but still manages to tell an interesting story.<br />The film takes a firm stance on the issue of discrimination. The audience is left in no doubt as to  whether there is any form of &quot;fair&quot; discrimination, although, those of us who look a little more deeply will find a curious crutch in the logic. These days, the rallying cry against discrimination could be, &quot;The best person for the job.&quot; It's hard to argue with that rule but Gattaca paints it in a new light. What if the &quot;best person&quot;, was selected at birth, genetically engineered to perfection.<br />The central character in the film is a natural birth, a love child, an Invalid, named Vincent Freeman. The tone is set at the start of the film when he is born. After naively committing to a natural fertilisation, the Freemans are shocked to learn, from a post-natal genetic test, that their baby boy has a high probability of heart disease and an estimated life expectancy of 32 years. Learning of this imperfection the father decides to name him Vincent, reserving his own name, Anton, for their next child; a strapping boy designed to be strong, fast and smart. A son to be proud of.<br />In a fast vignette we see the consequences of this unequal birth on the older son. Vincent is smaller than his younger brother, weaker, near sighted and, most tellingly, is treated as if he is always sick  or too fragile to tackle any of life's ordinary adventures. His parents may have been indoctrinated to see him as a lesser human but the audience is not fooled. Vincent has passion, he has dreams and we don't need the swelling music to know that he is going to overcome his genetic handicap. Although the method he uses is surprising.<br />We've seen a lot of films about heroic figures fighting the injustices of race or sex discrimination but few heros simply cheat. I am sure their must have been Jews high up in the Nazi bureaucracy, who had to lie and hide in order to maintain their position, but I don't remember any stories about them. This is their story. Vincent takes on the identity of Jerome Morrow, one of the genetic elite, played superbly by Jude Law. Jerome, is perfect in every way, except for being crippled. His is an interesting character, just one of many in the film.<br />So Vincent, now Jerome, using borrowed blood and urine, follows his dream to become an astronaut. Employed by the space program after a very brief interview, consisting of one blood sample, he burrows into his new role and bides his time. He is meticulous in protecting his alias; going to the extent of vacuuming his dandruff off the keyboard and leaving false lint and hair around his workstation.<br />One week before he is due to launch there is a murder. One of the mission directors is beaten to death  and this brings the full weight of the law down onto the Centre. Sure enough, traces of an Invalid are found and Vincent becomes the focus of a massive manhunt. Luckily, everyone thinks Vincent is Jerome, even Irene his beautiful colleague, Uma Thurman, who is asked to assist the police with their investigation. As love interests go, Uma is always a good choice but her character is made especially interesting when we discover she hides a great shame; she has a small genetic flaw which makes her less than perfect.<br />There are many subtle tensions in Gattaca but overall the story is presented in broad strokes. The tag line for the film reads, &quot;There is no gene for the human spirit.&quot; We believe this and can't help pulling for Vincent but the sad conclusion we are left with, is that perfection may be the ultimate prison. How can one find pride in life when everyone expects you to be perfect? As Director Josef says, &quot;No-one exceeds their potential.&quot;e perfect? As Director Josef says, &quot;No-one exceeds their potential.&quot;
B000059Z8J|5.0|i think mr. reeves performance of the superman/clark kent character is a just example of acting genius. he plays both ends of the spectrum with such convincing feeling, its almost incredible. on one hand, he is a bumbling nerd who is constantly stumbling over his own two feet or his tounge. on the other hand, he plays a strong, courageous yet humanly humble man who makes you believe not only in him, but believing in yourself, as well. i also think this movie is priceless because of the mechanics of the movie itself. the other reviewers are right.. any cartoon/comic hero is judged solely on the critera set forth by superman the movie. i look at movies like the batman movies, where the movie is set almost as a living comic book, and where you cant see any way at all that this movie could take place in real life. to be honest, it makes me ill. this is by far the best comicbook based movie i have ever seen, because everytime i see it, i look up in the sky, hoping to see that blue, red and yellow costume swoop by, letting me know that everything is right with the world. warner bros is coming out with a show this fall of 2001 called &quot;smallville&quot;, which will be a dawsons creek type teen show dealing with the problems and feelings of a 15 year old freshman in high school, who 1) feels alone in the world because he is 15, and 2) has to deal with all these new and strange powers that are developing. this series, upon success, is supposed to be a springboard for a new superman movie. i just hope and pray that its not a &quot;living comicbook&quot; type program like lois and clark, or any batman movie not starring micheal keaton. i hope clark/superman is protrayed in the same awesomely inspiring yet humbling light as he is protrayed by christopher reeve. this movie is highly recommended.
080017948X|4.0|A very cute movie.  Many of my friends do NOT like this movie... it's definitely an &quot;either you love it or you hate it&quot; kinda movie.  Personally, I could watch it over and over again and never get bored with it, there's always something new to catch that you missed before.  You won't rent it for mental stimulation...in fact, it could quite give you a headache... it's dizzying storyline is very much pre-&quot;Run Lola Run&quot;.  Nonetheless, its humor - both slapstick and morbid - is very entertaining.  I'd say:  Try it first (i.e., rent it from the video store).
6303407188|4.0|I have been a fan of Bela Lugosi's for some time, but have never seen any of his Ed Wood pictures. This is the first film I have seen even pertaining to Ed Wood. It was quite good. A very loving recreation and recollection of a young mans vision to produce, direct, and star in movies. Martin Landau was excellent as the aged Bela Lugosi whom Wood befriends. A very heartbreaking picture in which Landau shows how Lugosi becomes a shadow of his former self. Highly recommended to Wood and Lugosi fans.

B000056K04|5.0|DMB's &quot;Everyday&quot; is a great album individual to DMB's others. The first song and single off &quot;Everyday&quot; is an upbeat foot-tapper with excellent vocal harmonies and bass. &quot;Space Between&quot; is a slower paced, probable crowd favorite. For all you latin music fans, &quot;Mother Father&quot; stars Carlos Santana on guitar. &quot;So Right&quot; and title track &quot;Everyday&quot;, quite possibly the best songs on &quot;Everyday&quot;, sound like DMB to the core. To sum up &quot;Everyday&quot;, it's very good, catchy, and begs for touring.
B000002J03|1.0|I must say that I don't understand how you reviewers can describe this album as &quot;thunderous&quot;.When I first heard Whole Lotta Love I thought to myself &quot; it sounds like he's playing a toy guitar, a plastic guitar&quot;. I honestly thought it was a quiet intro before the real ,hard song began.The reviewer who said that no albums rocks quite as hard as this one must have a very small record collection. However before you Led Zeppelin fans damn my soul to the fiery pits of hell, I have to say that I do quite like this album because the toy guitar sound and cute songs like Thank you and What Is And what Should Never Be bring back some lovely childhood memories of being taken to Santa's Magic Grotto and seeing the elfs,the first time I saw Bambi in the theatre with my parents , and the nice birthday cake I got for my fourth birhday( it had a lovely little pink sugar mouse on it)

B000002J09|2.0|I find it strange that reviews along the lines of &quot;Led Zeppelin are overrated&quot; get marks like &quot;2 out of 12 people found this review helpful&quot; , while a review which claims that &quot;Led Zeppelin are pop , not rock&quot; has hordes of people ( mainly fanatical Zeppelin worshippers) angrily pressing the &quot;no&quot; button here generating marks like &quot;11 out of 61 people found this review helpful&quot;. In other words, people are more concerned about people thinking that their band are rock rather than pop than they are concerned about people thinking that they're overrated.This is proof to me that part of Led Zeppelins appeal comes from their image- their image of &quot;rock gods&quot; who made &quot;serious&quot; music&quot;. Led Zeppelin are mainly an American high school phenomenon. Part of their appeal comes from their &quot;coolness&quot;. If a high school kid wants to get credibility, which band will he say he's into? That's right -&quot;Zeppelin&quot;. But really ,Led Zeppelin ARE one of the most overrated bands of all time. Led Zeppelin 2 was a major step forward for the developmeant of hard rock, but by the time of this album, as one reviewer pointed out, their usefulness was exhausted. Black Dog is the most overrated song I've ever heard in my life, matched only by Kashmir. And it DOES sound exactly like Four Sticks. Stairway To Heaven is a good, maybe even great song, but it doesn't make Led Zeppelin into the best band ever. I'm not saying that they were a bad band, but the best band of all time? No. And the reason why the &quot;other side&quot; has strong feelings about Led Zeppelin is that we are disgusted that Led Zeppelin are almost literally worshipped like Gods when in fact they were merely a moderately talented rock/blues/folk band who were also not as innovative as people think they were.
B000002JSP|4.0|One nice thing about owning this CD is I finally get to see what was under the brown paper wrapper this record album came in (I was doing cassettes at the time).  Of course, no one knew in 1979 that this was going to be Led Zeppelin's last album because of the death of John Bonham, which certainly tends to distort perceptions of &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot; now.  What stands out in retrospect are the diverse musical styles covered in these seven tracks: from the thundering rock 'n' roll of &quot;In the Evening&quot; to the blues in &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl,&quot; as well as reggae in &quot;Fool in the Rain,&quot; and even something in the area of country &amp; western with &quot;Hot Dog.&quot;  You have to wonder how much of this diversity is due to John Paul Jones, who gets writing credit on six of the tracks and contributes notable keyboard work on several of the tracks, including the driving force on both &quot;South Bound Saurez&quot; and &quot;Carouselambra&quot; as well as a nice Beatleseque synthesizer horn interlude on &quot;All My Love.&quot;  The first two tracks on each &quot;side&quot; of this album are the best and the rest is pleasant enough.  It is certainly possible to look at the Page's soundtracks for the second and third &quot;Death Wish&quot; movies and Plant's solo albums to get a feel for where Led Zep wanted to go next.  But this album has to be the group's swan song simply because we do not have anything else.
0783225881|5.0|As the title implies, this is a 'magic' film.  Not that the movie is about sword &amp; sorcery -- it's not. It's about the magic of believing in a dream and following through.<br />Touching without forced sentimentality is how I guess you might best describe the story. It's about an Iowa farmer (Kevin Cosner), estranged from his father (now deceased) from the age of 17, who mananges a second chance to make amends by building a very special baseball diamond on his farm.<br />I won't go over the story line. I'm sure one of the 67 previous reviews has already done that. Instead, let me assure you that this is a film you will not soon forget, nor regret having bought. And while you might not be willing to accept that this story could actually happen, the sheer humanity of it will overwhelm you -- possibly to even shedding a tear during the ending scenes.<br />The action flows smoothly with little or no wasted footage. The movie's message comes through loud and clear, the acting is suberb and the directing is unmatched. Yes, Hollywood can still make 'em.<br />The DVD itself is bright and clear for both picture and sound. I don't know why they are rated so low in those two categories above. The disc comes with an added bonus &quot;scrapebook&quot; with the story behind the story. Yes, it's pricy at almost $30, but I think you'll find that the DVD is worth it. Definately a film you'll watch more than once.<br />Bottom line? Great (and I do mean great) movie at a somewhat high price -- but worth the admission. Definitely a 'keeper'.<br />*** Highly Recommended ***<br />~ P ~
6305538018|3.0|David Cronenberg is a very sick man. Everytime I tape another one of his movies &amp; sit down to watch it, I wonder about an industry that would continue to give this man money with which to record his personal obsessions. Of course, the fact that I find it necessary to tape &amp; watch the films provides the answer!<br />&quot;eXistenZ&quot; is, in a nutshell, Cronenberg's return to the themes of his first film &quot;Videodrome&quot;. Since &quot;Videodrome&quot; was produced at the dawn of the cable era, it used the video aspect of modern society to make its' points. Now that computer gaming is so much a part of modern society, Cronenberg has found an even more potent tool for his surgical dissections of mass media.<br />To viewers who haven't seen this earlier work, Cronenberg's repeated use of &quot;bioports&quot;, &quot;gamepods&quot; &amp; other artifacts of mutant genentech may seem ripped out of William Gibson's later works. However, &quot;Videodrome&quot; presented us with repellent representations of man merging with plastic way back in the late 70's (well before Gibson was a household name). The vision however has grown much darker. We've watched the progression thru the intermediate works of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, &quot;the Krays&quot; &amp; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; but &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is so dark as to be almost unwatchable at times.<br />I realize I am completely ignoring any plot synopses, but you can read other reviews for that. I will mention that Jennifer Jason Leigh does excellent work as the &quot;demoness Allegra Geller&quot; &amp; Jude Law does an excellent &quot;PR nerd&quot; keeping an American accent credibly thruout. <br />Will you enjoy &quot;eXistenZ&quot;? That depends on your gross-out factor. If you enjoy watching amorphous pulsating blobs slithering into apertures in people's spinal columns, the answer is a resounding YES. For the rest of us, the answer is a little more ambivalent. The issues dealt with are important &amp; thought- provoking. It is the manner in which Cronenberg chooses to present them that makes me state he is a very sick man!
B000056K04|5.0|Why is it that there are many many negative reviews about this album???  I personally think it's Dave Matthews best yet!  There is no song on this album that does not have the potential to be a hit in my personally opinion.  The electric guitar works and you still hear Boyd Tinsley and Leroi Moore quite nicely, they still add a very nice touch to the music.
B00004U2G1|5.0|Simply put, this album will never be topped, not even by Boston themselves!  Nearly 25 years after it's release, it is still the biggest selling debut album ever at 16 million and counting; and to think it was recorded by Tom Scholz in his basement!  I have listened to this album a thousand times, and it's the closest I've ever come to having a &quot;religious experience&quot;.  Like Robert Johnson did with the Blues 40 years earlier, Boston took rock music soaring to such a high level that no one has even dared to attempt since. I feel this Super Audio CD would be worth the price of the hardware alone.  If I could hear this just once in 24-bit quality, I could die and say my life was complete! :-)
B000002J0N|4.0|Not my favorite Crosby, Stills and Nash cd, but I still like it.  Their harmonies are marvelous as usual.  I personally like Cold rain and Cathedral the best.  Of course one of their most radio friendly hits is on this album--Just a song before I go.  It was rumored that Graham Nash wrote the song waiting on his plane at the airport.  One of the guys said, &quot;Hey Graham, while we're waiting why don't you write a song&quot; And what an incredible song it turned out to be.  If you like albums where the group actually writes the words to their own songs than you will enjoy any Crosby, Stills and Nash album.
B000056K04|2.0|It pains me to say that this cd sucks. I love Dave, but this is just awful. Dave's electric guitar and the droning, manufactured sound of this cd, is enough to land ME in depression.
B000002U6E|5.0|I love this cd.  It is always in the car with me.  I really find it very inspirational.  The words in the songs really make you think.  Most people will know Return to Innocence, or Out from the deep, but my favorite is Silent Warrior.  It really tells an important story about the Europeans coming to America and taking the land away from the Native Americans in the name of God. It will really make you think.  Personally, it is my favorite Enigma album, and one of my favorite albums of all time.
630512762X|5.0|Face/Off has to be, without doubt, one of the greatest action movies ever made. It's a fact.  Anyone can cobble together a half-decent action movie when provided with sufficient budget, but Woo does it with such style and flair that it just takes your breath away.  The plot is original, though fairly superfluous, with some face swapping shennanigans. It's basically an excuse for plenty of explosions and awesome combat sequences. There's the usual Woo trademark 'leaping through the air in slow motion with a gun in each hand'. But none of the action is clunky or feels out of place (Broken Arrow). A destructive shootout with Over The Rainbow playing is a particularly memorable scene.  Then there's the actors. Charismatic John Travolta basically spends most of the film as the villian, which gives him much more time to have fun and come out with some great lines. &quot;Your son was an accident, I wanted to kill you. But you took it so personally.&quot; He has real presence on screen, which sometimes causes him to overshadow his partner, Cage. Nicolas Cage, currently flavour of the month in Hollywood and one of the most versatile actors around, does most of the work playing the good guy, which is just as well since he looks rather uncomfortable as the villain. Still, he's perfect playing an honest man trapped in the body of a criminal, he can look both vulnerable and dominant when the occasion calls for it. Overall, both actors give great performances, learning to copy each others style so that it really does look like they've swapped faces.  Basically, Face/Off is everything you could want from an action film. It's got two great main characters, explosions by the bucketload, enough guns to invade a small country, and a climax that blows away the competition (as well as a dozen people, two speedboats, a police boat...)
0195117298|4.0|The history of science has been the explanation of phenomena that were previously the domain of philosophers, and this is true of Julian Barbour's book, &quot;The end of Time&quot;.  Barbour's simple idea is that time does not exist in nature.  But since time is explicitly entwined with motion, Barbour faces a much more monumental task--banishing the very motion responsible for the abstract concept of time itself. This he does quite convincingly.  Newton believed motion was relative to absolute space;  Einstein proposed that space and time must be considered together; and Barbour calls space and time redundant.  There is nothing that lies within our physical universe, no internal change relative to the universe as a whole. Rather,  all that we &quot;see&quot; as objects in motion &quot;within&quot; the universe are in fact part of the whole universe itself.  Movement is simply different configurations of the holistic universe in total.  Therefore, there is no motion, and by defintion no time.  This is the intuitve concept that Barbour presents.  Though I believe it could have been presented in a shorter format, it is certainly worth the read.
B000056K04|3.0|The title of this album describes the style of the music very well.  It's &quot;everyday&quot; music.  It doesn't have the usual DMB flair that the past 3 studio albums have had.  All of the songs are somewhat catchy, but most sound somewhat the same.  Glen Ballard has changed DMB in this album, a complete 180 degree turn around from last album.  In the last album they really got to show their musical explorations, ranging from the minor key, nearly classical &quot;Halloween&quot; to the eastern sound of &quot;The Last Stop,&quot; and all of the various short interludes in between tracks.  Glen Ballard has changed DMB from one of the few breaths of fresh air in today's music into a somewhat cookie-cutter sounding band in this album.  All the songs are right around 4 minutes, perfect for radio play.  This might be a good move in a way because it will surely get more exposure in the mainstream, which will lead to a larger fan base.  Still this album is a bit dissapointing.  Glen Ballard is fine for some bands, just not for DMB.  Too much of their musical creativity has been limited on this album.  Nevertheless the songs are still good, so it still gets 3 stars.
6304806442|4.0|For some reason, people think this flick glorifies heroin.  It really bugs me that people think everything should be spelled out, that humanity is too stupid to stop and think for a second.  Do we really need every movie about drugs to be a more intelligent version of &quot;Reefer Madness?&quot;<br />You have to be incredibly inobservant to think this movie, which has overdoses, formerly healthy people becoming junkies and promptly dying of AIDS, babies dying of neglect, a psychotic destroying everyone in his path, and other unpleasant things glorifies heroin in any way, shape or form.  Even leaving all those things out, these guys embarass themselves and make themselves look like jackasses often enough that you'd never want to be them.  Frankly, if people want to be junkies after seeing this movie, that's just natural selection.  Just because the direction is highly stylish (and Danny Boyle, the director, does a great job of being flashy without interfereing with the movie) doesn't mean the movie is a glorification.<br />It's very well written and acted, with Ewan McGregor leading the cast.  Also of note is Robert Carlyle, virtually unrecognizable under a walrus mustache, as the frightening Begbie.<br />This is more of a comedy than &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot;, probably the  best heroin tragedy in a long time.  But it's still pretty harsh, and definitely worth seeing.
0312084986|5.0|These stories are true treasures. While the BBC series is amusing, these stories are far more personal. You get to met Dr. Herriot (a pseudonym for James Alfred Wight) who starts as a young veternarian just out of school and joins a country practice. Cows get the better of him, the local Yorkshire farmers one-up him, he gets his car inevitably stuck in the mud and yet prevails as a caring, resourceful vet who loves his quirkly rural clients as much the animals he cares for. He also writes with such laugh-outloud humor and self-deprecation you just wish the book would go on and on. Fortunately, he wrote four more of these books (each named for a line in a hymn) and a memoir of his father, in whose practice he began. They really give you the flavor of rural life in England before and after WWII.<br />I can't believe these stories are 30 years old, and Dr. Herriot has passed on. Thankfully he left this legacy behind for us to savor. These are books to re-read on dreary days with a cup of tea or just when you really need something to lift your spirits.
6304913176|1.0|Take a classic SF novel and give it to a director and scriptwriter who are both only semi-literate and who have never read any of the literature of science fiction.  Add to that the attention span of an MTV junkie and this is what you'd get.  All of the thoughtful, introspective parts are left out and there is more violence in the movie than in the original novel.  Add to that the idiot depiction of both the training camp and the enemy and you have worthless tripe.
B000050XEI|4.0|I see that others complain about the CD being short, which it is.  But if you like Enya then this is a great album.  I have not been able to stop listening to it since I got it.  It is extremely relaxing and the melodies and vocals are beautiful.
0679879269|5.0|this was a good book but its not for kiddies. i liked it but its not for staunch religous beleivers. because it discusses the idea that &quot;god&quot; which is just a strong angel created a world thats called the world of the dead (worse and i mean around the area of 20 or 30 times worse than hell) and your stuck there forever. and it also has content and idaes for much older readers than elementary students (when you go &quot;ewwwwww yuck sick&quot; at kissing)(and it goes a little farther than that)(make that alot farther) other wise its a great book.
0679879269|5.0|It is very difficult to review this book without giving out any spoilers, but I will try.  This is the third and unfortunately final part in Philip Pullman's masterful Dark Materials trilogy, in which the two heroes Will and Lyra turn thirteen and travel to the land of the dead to find the shade of Roger, the kitchen-boy whom Lyra set out to rescue from the \\"Gobblers\\" in the first book of the series.  Their plan is to use Will's Subtle Knife (hence the title of the second book) to open a gate into the land of the dead.  Meanwhile, Dr Mary Malone, a particle physicist from our own world and specialist in fundamental physics and dark matter, finds herself in another world where evolution favoured diamond-shaped skeletons instead of spinal columns.  The book leads slowly to the final confrontation between Lyra's father and the being known as Metatron (the \\"god\\" worshipped by christians).  This is a beautiful but very cruel book, with the most vivid description of true love (between Will and Lyra of course) contained in any book written in the English language.  Any christian fanatics criticising this book for portraying the love between a boy and a girl obviously know nothing about what it is to be a teenager wracked by such powerful emotions.  Unfortunately Philip Pullman decided to deny the two heroes a happy ending, leaving this 26-year old reader devastated, heart-broken and in tears.  You have been warned.
0345389409|1.0|I loved the first four books. I am stuck halfway through this one because it is so turgid, and it is holding me up from enjoying the rest of the saga. The same debates are in the Bible, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot;, and the originals are a lot more interesting than the imitation. In fact, I'm just going to jump straight to &quot;The Vampire Armand&quot; - life is too short.
B000056VIY|4.0|Jennifer Lopez has without a doubt done a cool second album and i can't believe people are hating on her and critising this C.D. First thing, Jennifer Lopez is incredibly talented: How many of y'all can write songs, sing, dance, act and be a total style queen?! I found all the songs apart from 3 of them to be excellent. Let me break it down for you: 1. Love don't cost a thing- As you know it has an R n' B feel to it and is a great song.<br />2. I'm real- Must say, the beginning is excellent. The beat is fantastic, very catchy and R n'B style. My fave track of the C.D.<br />3. Play-Very Maddona style. It's sort of like 'music' but NOT mediocre and monotonous.<br />4. Walking on sunshine- If you loved 'waiting for tonight' then you'll love this. This is a pop song overall but puff daddy has produced it and is one of my favourites. Lopez really sounds good on this song.<br />5. Ain't it funny- Sorry Jennifer, but i don't like the Spanish-type beginning but the rest of the song is excellent. Lopez even holds a high note on this one.<br />6. Carino- This is alright, its not unbearable or anything but has the corny Ricky Martin type thing going down. The same thing happens in the horrendous 'Dame'.<br />7. Come over- This is a slow song and it grew on me (when i knew the words to it!). It depends on my mood whether i give this song a listen. I think Jennifer Lopez really SHINES on the track 'too late' off 'on the 6'. A few of those type of ballads with a beat to it would be great and Jen's real fans would love it i'm sure.<br />8.We gotta talk- This song has the R n' B style without a doubt and is midtempo. The use of guitar is good.<br />9.That's not me- It starts off slow but has a VERY upbeat chorus. A very good song.<br />10.Dance with me- Produced by Puffy,so you can probably work out that it's excellent. It's a pity they split up, Puffy really knows how to bring out the talent in Jennifer.Anyways, the song starts off Ricky Martin style and then the hip-hop/R n' B beats come in. Jennifer's voice sounds super on this one.<br />11. Secretly- Have to say, didn't like this is first but i do now. Lopez sings this in a slightly unnatural manner (it's a slow song). Maybe Jennifer should steer clear of really slow songs for her next album so i can give it 5 stars.<br />12. i'm gonna be alright- A very good song, R n'B meets pop. Excellent.<br />13. That's the way- Produced By 'Dark child' a.k.a Rodney Jerkins. If you like songs produced by him generally you'll love this.<br />14. Dame- HOW TRAGIC!!!! This is an album filler for sure. The guy singing on this sounds dreadful. * ONE THINGS FOR SURE JENNIFER LOPEZ AND ALL OTHER SINGING ARTISTS SHOULD LEAVE SPANISH-SOUNDING CHEESY,CORNY MUSIC ALONE- TONI BRAXTON'S 'SPANISH GUITAR' IS AN EXCEPTION! * What was Jerkins thinking when producing and writing this track?!<br />15. Si ya se acabo- It's O.K but...er... what does it mean?!!!!! On the whole the album is very good, the 12 brilliant tracks make up for the 3 lame spanish ones despite my critisism. This is definetely a major achievement for Lopez,i mean i have stupidly bought albums in the past with about 8 good tracks in total. If you love R n'B and pop go to the record store and get yourself a copy of J.LO. P.S i hope you have found my 100% honest review helpful!! Thanks for reading.

B00004NRWH|5.0|Roll down your windows, turn up the car stereo, and be prepared to be blown away!  Nickelback's debut CD THE STATE leaves all other rock albums in the dust.  The roaring bass, clever drum lines, and the lead singer's enchanting voice and lyrics make Nickelback one of the best (little-known) bands out there.  Every song is well-writeen, complete, and worthy of a single.  I would not hesitate to call them America's answer to Bush, and they are answering this call very well.  Nickelback is music to any rock fan's ears.
B00001NFCY|1.0|I bought this c.d. on the basis that any c.d. that could last so long near the top of the U.S. charts must have some positive aspects to it.How wrong my choice was again.Here we have another U.S. rock band whose music is totally unoriginal and dull.From the very first few chords of the opening track,'Are You Ready',I knew I was in trouble and had wasted my money.It's back to the dark old days of '91,when grunge and the music of that ilk dominated the chart.It's fine maybe to have that music as an influence,but to parody it so completely without taking any new steps has to be some sort of joke.<br /> To make matters worse the lead singer believes he's the new Eddie Vedder-does the world need another Pearl Jam?I hope not,one is just about bearable enough.Lyrically it's the same old stuff of &quot;nobody knows me,cares for me,understands me,etc&quot;.Oh please why do so many of these lyricists feel so sorry for themselves.Why do so many people empathise with them is totally beyond me!They're making millions out of this,so why sympathise?These lyrics are just so dull.They lack any sense of irony and as for a sense of humour-well that's an alien concept for groups like Creed.<br /> Musically they don't seem to be exceptionally gifted either.Apart from the two singles,'With Arms Wide Open' and 'Higher'-the rest of the songs never take off,lack in even the most basic of melodies.On songs like &quot;Say I&quot; and &quot;Inside Us All&quot;,you sort of sit there listening,saying to yourself &quot;oh this song is going to take off eventually&quot;.No they just drone on and on until the end.I know this review will prove unpopular with the thousands of Creed fans who live across the Atlantic-but I just wish this sort of dull,self-important music that takes itself way too seriously would have had it's day.
B000001AKM|5.0|This Greatest Hits CD proves that Lionel Richie is truly one of America's greatest ever singer/songwriters. Although Lionel is best know for his huge ballads there are however some outstanding uptempo tracks here as well proving what a versatile songwriter he really was.<br />Featuring all his major solo hits along with some of the Commodores (he was the lead vocalist) biggest hits as well this CD is a must for any music fan as it higlights great songwriting and if you love love songs there is no way you can do without this - buy it now.<br />Lionel's vocals show emotion in almost all his songs and everyone is touching in a way and you can feel the pain at times. Prime examples of this are Still, Truly and the phenomenally huge Hello. Other higlights include the more dancey Say You Say Me and possibly his finest achievement All Night Long which is a great dance tune. My favourite however is Three Times A Lady as it has to be one of the most beautiflu songs ever. <br />This man was a genius and this CD proves it and i highly recommend it to everybody.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I'm very stingy when it comes to buying cds, because you only listen to them when the music is popular or nice but after awhile you get bored of it and it's bye bye 20 bucks.   But No Angel is a classic album and all the songs are gems! My personal fave are &quot;Here with Me&quot; the roswell theme song and &quot;Thank you!&quot; At first i thought it would be very rockish, but No Angel is angelic to your ears and the songs are great and catchy very easy listening! You can listen to them forever... no bye bye 20 bucks this time...
B00004STPT|5.0|I don't know to express how good this album is. If you are a fan of Hans Zimmer, you will own this album, it's just that simple. But to those who have yet to discover this composer, how do I express how amazing his work is, this album in particular?<br />Many fans of Hans Zimmer like him for his ability to compose energetic orchestrations that convey a sense of action. If you read reviews of his scores for other films that do not live up to this reputation, such as The Thin Red Line or Crimson Tide, you will see how many fans are dissappointed not to see this style of composition. However both those scores are good pieces (especially Crimson Tide). Myself, I fell in love with Hans Zimmer from Backdraft because of his ability to create music that really hightened the emotions the film was trying to create; especially his ability convey a heroic feel.<br />I own decent selection of Hans Zimmer's work including: Black Rain, The Point of No Return, Music Inspired by K2, Backdraft, Crimson Tide, The Rock, The Lion King, The Thin Red Line, Gladiator, More Music from Gladiator, and Mission Impossible 2. Gladiator is Hans Zimmer's most diverse work to date. Typically sticking to one theme or feeling and expounding on it, Gladiator offers us a chance to see his talents in more than just one style. Fans of his exciting action filled orchestrations will not be dissapointed, but neither does this score feel as shallow as some of his other works in the action genre.<br />You have only to watch the film to hear the music which should deservingly receive the oscar this year. Unlike many film scores, the merits of the music do not depreciate when heard on it's own. This is not only one of the best movie scores of the year (perhaps of all time), but it is also a great album on it's own merits.
0486296954|5.0|Agatha Christie's sister once boasted to her that she had never read a mystery in which she didn't know right away who the killer was. Agatha answered her by writing her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles. It was quite a start to a brilliant literary career. The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well plotted and the characters are great to read about. Hercule Poirot and Hastings are really hilarious together. Poirot has to be the greatest crime-solver in literature. The entire cast of characters in this novel is interesting. This probably isn't Christie's best work (my favorite is The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) because her characteristic clean prose hadn't quite developed yet, but this is an extremely important work and is, like all of her books, entertaining. The literary critic Edmund Crispin summed Christie's work up best when he wrote: &quot;You know, relaxing with a Christie, that for an hour or two you can forget the authentic nastiness of life and submerge yourself in a world where, no matter how many murders take place, you are essentially in nevver-never land.&quot;
B0000019PA|5.0|This album is utterly spiritual from start to finish. All the songs integrate together on what I interpret to be a vein of spirituality, death, afterlife and relationships. I have owned it for over a year and am still fairly obsessed with it. I can only hope this is not the last we ever hear from Neutral Milk Hotel. And thus, I highly recommend it to any one who will enjoy hearing a wide variety of instruments not usually played together, some not usually heard. The band seems (to me) to be a crazy hybrid of punk rock an old circus music.
B000056K04|5.0|I am astounded at the reviews so-called fans of the Dave Matthews Band have written.  Every band has the right to grow, change and explore new avenues and I as a dedicated fan am going to support them no matter what they choose to do.  It takes a lot of guts for a band to come out with something different to what their fans are used to, but DMB has faith in those of us who support their changes, and as sales have shown it is worth it. Everday has a fresh sound and that is great to hear from a band, too many bands stick with the same old sound and disappear from view way too quickly.  This isn't going to happen to DMB anytime soon if those people who really are fans keep on supporting this evolving sound.  This CD has some awesome songs on it and great potential for the live jamming sessions we have come to expect from the band. Rock on Dave.
B000056K04|2.0|Like everyone else writing in, I'm a big DMB enthusiast.  Sad to say, then, that the new one is a true stinker.  I'm not upset that he allegedly &quot;sold out&quot; - many artists have done that and still made great albums.  What it comes down to are the songs - and most of these songs suck.  Why do they suck?  They're boring.  They're redundant.  The lyrics are weak.  Listening to the album is, basically, a tedious way to spend your time.<br />As a dutiful Dave fan, I've tried the album out about six or seven times.  That's all I can stand; I tried my best.  <br />&quot;Everyday&quot; - RIP.  February 27th, 2001 - March 10, 2001.  Sorry you had such a short life span in the rotation.  Hope you're better in concert this summer!

6304765231|2.0|I remember the day this movie entered my life.  The story and visuals are paked with emotion.  The music is stand alone.  Some of the best by NIN, Thrill Kill Kult, STP, Violen Femmes, and the CURE.  This movie Changed many lives.  Even today I still see people mimicing &quot;The Crow&quot;.<br />However much like Nosferatu or brazil, its birth was amazing, original, and new.  Today the film, with the skills of the late 80's, is lacking continuity, general acting abilities, and just plain keeping attention.  The ideas are amazing, the script is not.  This movie was very important in the 90's.  Today it's locked away in the archieves of the past.  Showing us once again that nothing will last forever....
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is the second Vonnegut novel I read, the first being Slaughterhouse-Five. I was highly impressed by both of them. He has become one of my favorite authors. Once again, I am amazed at Vonnegut's ability to treat deathly serious subjects so lightheartedly without trivializing them. I laughed out loud several times during the course of this book, and yet, it is no less profound than the overtly serious 1984. How can this be, you ask? The answer is that Vonnegut has discovered what Orwell, Huxley, and countless other brilliant &quot;fair warning&quot; writers failed to realize: humor is the one universal element. Many people disdain such so-called universal elements as love, religion, politics, and the like. However, NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE, is safe from the far-reaching potential of humor. Vonnegut uses it skillfully here. I won't go into plot details here, read the book for that. What I will say is that on the surface is an entertaining and fast-paced piece of black-humored satire, and between the lines is a highly relevant novel that has, and hopefully will continue to, displace the arrogance and folly of modern Man.
1558908323|5.0|The opening credits alone of this hybrid, bio-scifi thriller are enough to breed nightmares:  Squirming beetle tendrils silhouetted over images of diseased children as the texts darts in and out of focus at off angles.  Right off the bat you know you're in for a dark ride.<br /><br />This is one of those truly outlaw mainstream films; a slick, polished production which deftly avoids formulaic Hollywood conventions.  It is the classic Frankenstein scenario, updated to 90's New York with an insectile twist:  A well-meaning lady entomologist breeds a super insect as the only means of containing a lethal epidemic carried by the common cockroach.  The plan is a success, the plague is vanquished - but a whole new horror is unknowingly unleashed upon humanity, when this lab-bred creation begins to evolve, over the following years, on its own .......<br /><br />Without giving too much more away, the pace of this dark ride accelerates rapidly, with an offbeat unpredictability that keeps the viewer riveted.  The claustrophobic setting of NYC's decaying subway infrastructure is a ruinous manmade environment turned alien, out of control, not our world anymore .... a breeding place for the oversized Mantis-Roaches, who enter and pass through our nighttime urban wastelands, undetected with the help of a cleverly evolved \\"disguise\\", to prey upon derelicts or any who would dare violate their territory (an element recalling \\"Wolfen\\").  As our ragtag ensemble confronts the big buggy baddies, sympathetic characters (the comic relief, no less) and even kids aren't safe from nasty bits of onscreen massacre, and generous quantities of, um, fluids are spilled on both sides of the food chain in the course of correcting this ecological abomination.  Like a small-scale \\"Starship Troopers\\" gone underground, lots of ooze and aahhs.<br /><br />For high energy, bleak, repugnant fun, \\"Mimic\\" is one of the better recent popcorn-level diversions, with impressive effects, immaculate sound, and just enough brain candy and class to keep the more jaded creature feature veterans interested.  One small word of caution: you will hear noises afterwards that may remind you of that ominous skittering chatter, and a small boy's voice saying, \\"Funny, funny shoes .... funny, funny shoes ....\\"lass to keep the more jaded creature feature veterans interested.  One small word of caution: you will hear noises afterwards that may remind you of that ominous skittering chatter, and a small boy's voice saying, \\"Funny, funny shoes .... funny, funny shoes ....\\"
B00005214X|5.0|In this day of reissues and remasters, and the fact that this winter has shown a poor selection of new material by any artists, this album appeared as the sun after 3 consecutive months of overcast weather.  The power and beauty of the music, the extra tracks and remastering makes it a easy decision to buy.<br />I found the extra tracks to be a fantastic addition.  The acoustic demos of Beware of Darkness and Let it Down are a great break from the heavy production of the rest of the LP.  &quot;I Live for You&quot; is a great track.  &quot;My Sweet Lord 2000&quot; is a very cool remake, an affirmation that George is still alive and well despite the recent turmoil of his life.  <br />A welcome trip back to the 70's.

0780627016|5.0|Pleasantville is beautiful to watch and also a brilliant social commmentary. <br />The Pat Robertsons of the world will tell you that control is how to stamp out &quot;evil&quot;. Yet the prohibition didn't end the use of alcohol, and countless laws haven't stopped adultery. Forced conformity will only create a situation where free will is stifled, but it will not make them into &quot;good&quot; people. Only when human beings are allowed to explore and choose freely will they grow and mature. Not surprisingly, this film gets bad reviews from conservatives and fundamentalists who despise any choice besides the right to bear arms :)<br />Pleasantville shows that the idyllic world of 1950's tv (and the righ-wing) was just a fantasy, portraying a cleansed, edited version of reality: no minorities, misfits, poor or other unwanted. The residents of Pleasantville only become true human beings after being allowed some freedom from the limits of their pretend world. Of course this freedom cuts both ways, but that is what free will allows.<br />Great special effects, excellent performances by Joan Allen, Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon and Jeff Daniels. Definitely one the the best films of the decade!
6302820448|4.0|This is without a doubt, one of Bill Murray's best films. It is both a fantasy and a comedy flick. The basic premise of the film is simple. A man is forced to relive the same twenty four hours, over, and over, and over again, ad infinitum.<br />Bill Murray is that man. An obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman, he is in Punxutawney, Pennsylvania to cover its Groundhog Day celebration, along with his beautiful and altruistic TV producer, played by Andie MacDowell, and his patient, long suffering cameraman, played by Chris Elliot. Murray, playing an uncaring, unfeeling wretch of a guy, is, for some inexplicable reason, forced to relive the same twenty four hours in Punxutawney over and over again. Why? Who knows and who cares? What follows next are some of the funniest moments in film.<br />At first, Murray is confused. No one else, however, seems to be. As Murray continues to relive the same day, confusion turns to anger. Ultimately, that anger turns to mischieviousness and indulgence. After all, what would one do, if there were no consequences to one's actions?<br />This premise provides for quite a few, very funny scenes. This puckish foray quickly denigrates into profound despair, as Murray realizes that he seems destined to relive the same day forever. Frequent, subsequent suicide attempts fail to stop the clock, and Murray rethinks his position. He concentrates , finally, on becoming the best man that he can be, with the lovely Andie MacDowell as his romantic interest.<br />Murray's transition from smarm to charm provides for many hilarious scenes that will leave the viewer howling with laughter. The ultimate impact of his transition from Neanderthal man to Renaissance man  is, needless to say, a positive one.  This redemption will ultimately prove to be be Murray's salvation.<br />Murray provides droll, comedic delivery, and he is perfect in this role. Andie MacDowell is the perfect straight man and comedic foil. Together they make this  movie one that the viewer  will want to see again and again.l want to see again and again.
0195067142|5.0|I have read all 53 reviews of this book, which I have just finished reading.  When 51 of the 53 give the book 5 stars and the other 2 give it 4 stars you know that this book is exceptional.  I especially liked the fact that Sledge conveyed the horror of war without finding it necessary to give a tape-recorder-like expletives-not-deleted account of the language of the combatants, or to describe their sex lives.  James Webb, who wrote Fields of Fire, would have benefited from reading this book. I also appreciated the fact that at the end of the book there are pictures of the author as a Marine, to remind us anew what a kid he was when he went thru the events he describes so clearly and memorably.
B000002UB3|4.0|Something about Abbey Road makes me sad.  Not only the knowledge that it was the last album the Beatles recorded, but also the sense that you can witness the band breaking up within the album itself.  Even on the cover, we see John impatiently leading the way across the street, turning a cold shoulder, his face barely visible.  And musically, though the first half is eclectic enough, the second half is mostly dominated by Paul's ambitious-yet-slightly-disappointing &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money/Carry That Weight etc.&quot; medley.<br />I have never found any one Beatles album as wholly satisfying as, say, Pink Floyd's &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; or Steely Dan's &quot;Aja.&quot;  One of the nice things about Beatles albums, though, is that there are always a few genuine classics floating around in there, and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is no exception.  &quot;Come Together&quot; is one of Lennon's best, simply one of the grooviest songs ever recorded.  George Harrison is in top form with two entries, the equally sublime &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun.&quot;  The latter is an absolute delight, bright, optimistic, gentle -- as uplifting a bit of music as the Beatles ever did.  Finally we get &quot;Because,&quot; which, as a dreamy expression of '60s psychedelia, almost ranks with &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds.&quot;<br />Then there are the second-tier songs.  &quot;Oh! Darling,&quot; a takeoff on a bluesy/doo wop number, is jolly good fun, worth listening to just for Paul's over-the-top scratchy vocals and Little Richard &quot;woos.&quot;  &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; deserves a place next to &quot;When I'm 64&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; as an utterly charming children's song.  I especially like the lyric, &quot;In an octopus's garden/near a cave.&quot;  Ringo just added that little cave in there, a final brush-stroke of narrative detail. :-)  I can do without the show-tuney &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer,&quot; though it does achieve Paul's usual standard of competence.  &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; strikes me as a missed opportunity, some great melodic/harmonic ideas, very very groovy bluesy atmosphere, and brilliant Paul bass playing -- but way too long, trying to stretch limited musical material too far.  If it were four minutes long instead of neary eight, it would have worked better.<br />Then there is the medley, mostly Paul's baby.  Certainly it's the most ambitious example of a unified, long-form experiment in the Beatles canon, and there is some great material in there -- particularly the reprise of &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; toward the end, and the rousing &quot;Carry That Weight&quot; anthem.  But if you listen to &quot;YNGMYM,&quot; you realize something chilling.  Beautiful as it is, it's not a Beatles song: it's a Wings song!  Note how its form (several unique song sections crammed together) foreshadows such Wings tunes as &quot;Band on the Run&quot; and &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey.&quot;  The production values, including that Broadway-esque piano part, also point toward the bloated '70s.  In fact, the second half of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; feels eerily like a proto-Wings album!<br />Earlier Beatles songs that were entirely composed by Paul (such as &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&quot;) were still Beatles songs in essence.  But with &quot;YNGMYM&quot; and its sequels, something has changed.  Somewhere, in that tiny space between &quot;Because&quot; and &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money,&quot; something has broken -- something that can never be put back together.  The Beatles are gone: the ghost is out of the machine.  &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is like a sad ecstatic sigh, a celebration and a mourning.
B0000560RV|5.0|If you follow music closely enough to have heard of Sigur Ros, buy this album if you can find it.  This album is one of the most beautiful soundscapes I've ever heard, sounding somewhat like shoegazing evolving to its most beautiful level possible.  Even though they use little more than a basic 4 piece rock band, with an occasional extra instrument, it sounds bigger than your local philharmonic.  Add the who-would-believe-that's-a-male siren vocals of Jon Por Birgisson, to complete the sound.  It's hard to listen to this album and not feel like you are not only listnening to something entirely new and unworldly, but also in some entirely unfamiliar awe inspiring landscape.<br />Comparisons to godspeed you black emperor! have been frequent, but while both bands are are concerned about Art with a capital A, Sigur Ros makes sure the art is obvious in the music, unlike godspeed who want you to think there is a lot going on you don't understand.  The best comparison I can think of is if the Dirty Three were determined to be the greatest, or at least grandest,  Rock band ever.  While post-rock may be the closest label to try to fit on Sigur Ros, it ignores their passion, rather easily accessible beauty, and even the vaguely anthemic quality of some of the songs.
B000001GXJ|4.0|The truth is that the best parts of this recording are the tenor, Jose Carreras and the soprano, Mirella Freni.  And it is probably not fair to say &quot;Well, it aint Gobbi/Christoff&quot;.  All that is true but the performance stands very nicely on its own qualities, thank you very much. Even if Cappuccilli does not make the character come alive as Gobbi did, the singing is quite beautiful and the text is delivered with integrity and point.  Ghiaurov has never done much for me, and he doesnt here either, but, again, there is some understanding of the text and pointed delivery.  I will always value this Simon, however, for the beauty brought to the parts by Carreras and Freni:  they have not be equalled in my experience.  Abbado, also, is a strength in this recording.
0803723865|4.0|Here is a good choice for a read-aloud. This flows off the tounge and it is as much fun for the reader as it is for the listener. <br />Trust me on this one....it's a good choice for K-3.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Teenage rock journalist William Miller has just been given the opportunity of a lifetime, follow up-and-coming band Stillwater on tour, and put together a cover story for Rolling Stone magazine.<br />William quickly makes friends with a &quot;band-aide&quot; Penny Lane (Kate Hudson in a star making, Oscar nominated role), who will introduce him to the fast paced world of rock stars.  Guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup in a perfomance that definitely deserved an Oscar nomination),  is the first to take a liking to William, and the two will form a bond that is held together by Penny.<br />While traveling with the band, city after city, William is no closer to the angle of his story, but with the help of legendary writer Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), he may come up with the story of a lifetime, and learn some important lesson's on life.<br />&quot;Almost Famous&quot; is the best movie of the year, it is PACKED with superb performances; Kate Hudson is so good that you can't take your eyes off her.  Billy Crudup is nothing less than spectacular in a role that proves he is one of the most talented actors working today.  Newcomer Patrick Fugit lights up the screen in the lead role of William (based on writer/director Cameron crowe).  Frances McDormand, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Lee, Fairuza Balk, and Anna Paquin are top-notch in supporting roles.  Look for 70's rock star Peter Frampton in a small role.<br />Cameron Crowe (director of &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;) scores a direct HIT with this coming of age comedy, set in the rock-and-roll world of the 1970's,   <br />Funny, touching, and totally entertaining, &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is a MUST see!<br />Nick Gonnella
B00000I8UJ|5.0|I bought GO a couple of months ago, listened to it, loved it. I listened to it again recently and loved it even more. It's puzzling to me when I see &quot;essential&quot; jazz recording lists, GO rarely appears. Well, it makes my essential list and has easily pushed it's way into my top 10. From the exultant opening blow of &quot;Cheese Cake&quot; to the stunning ballad &quot;I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry&quot; you realize you are hearing a musician &quot;in the zone&quot; who has complete command of his talent and is evoking it here at will. As the liner notes state, &quot;Dexter soars like a condor over the Andes, with grandeur and great staying power.&quot; This also contains my favorite recording of &quot;Love For Sale.&quot; There is not a wasted note on this album. It's like witnessing a baseball pitcher throwing a perfect game.
B000056QE5|5.0|I bought this CD when it came out around '98 and I love it!  It reminds me so much of the movie and is so upbeat; its great to sing along and clean house to! My niece will fall asleep right away listening to this cd and drinking a bottle of apple juice. If you loved the movie, you'll love this CD! Yea!!!!! Two thumbs up!!!!!!!

0679879269|3.0|This was really very dissapointing.  I waited for the stupid book for THREE YEARS, he could have writen it a little faster!  Then when I finally read it I didn't like it.  The main agenda of the story didn't bother me nor did the fact that he set God up as basicly an old senile fool who had tricked everyone into believing he was the Creator.  It didn't bother me that Lyra and Will fell in love-it felt right and it sort of seemed like they're older than they are.  I hate it when authors kill off characters that you have become attached to in this or perevious books, he did.  I could have dealt with this though, if the end had been satisfying and what I wanted.  He didn't have to end it that way, a little change in the plot/dialogue and it could have  been a happily ever after story(I love happy endings-if the end is bad so is the book.  The end is the end so if you're going to and it you have to have a nice one.)  The end was just terible I wanted them to live happily ever after.  If the ending was better I would give it four stars-it just doesn't deserve them now.  No matter what I say you HAVE to read it if you've read the other books-there is no way you couldn't, you need to know howhe finnishes it.  The first book was much better and the second was good but felt fast.  The third just can't compare to the others, it seemed rushed and a bit undeveloped.
B000058T5E|5.0|It's never been easy to pin Jeff Beck down. He's always come across intense and dark, but much of his music is meldoic and airy. He managed to turn his gentle rage into a masterpiece on 1990's Guitar Shop, and captured heat on record with Who Else!. But there's no new ground broken on You Had It Coming.
0452282152|3.0|The great strength of the novel for me was the painstaking recreation of Vemeer's household and his method of working. (I must go and look at some of his paintings again!) It's an undemanding and fairly enjoyable read, although I found the characterisation thin and the plot slow moving at times. The domestic details become tedious after a while, and there is a real lack of dramatic tension in the novel, even in the scenes between Vermeer and Griet.  I wonder if we would feel so much for Griet without Vermeer's wonderful painting on the cover of the book? Perhaps the book would appeal much more to young readers.
B000002I25|5.0|This album is probably the Doors' best, just because Jim wasn't drinking as heavily at the time.  But still, I was raised completely on this album, I love it.  It stays in my CD player all the time.  All of the tracks are completely incredible, and Jim's vocals are amazing.  Everyone should listen to this record, just because it's SO good.  I love this record so much, I have it on CD, tape AND record, just because it's my favorite.  If anyone's thinking about buying this album, they should buy it!  It's not the Beatles or the Stones, or Hendrix for that matter, but that's what's incredible about it -- it's different. :)
B000002OZY|5.0|What can i say about Tommy? it is a tour-de-force, a 20th century masterpiece! I find the album so relatable, everyone feels like Tommy at least sometimes, lost and confused in this cold, strange, uncaring world. Tommy made me realize its time to stop living for others and to Love and care about yourself. It is also a fascinating story if you listen closely, the movie is worth checking out as well. The Who have many other great albums as well, but Tommy is the most unique and is a must have for any human being!
0385335482|5.0|What a hilarious book this is!  All British literature and/or Bridget Jones fans will love Confessions of a Shopaholic--it meets every expectation.<br />Twenty-five-year-old Rebecca Bloomfield is in love ~~ with shopping!  She has maxed credit cards and an incredibly overdrafted bank account.  But, surprisingly, this does not stop her from frequenting shops and cafes during her lunch hour.  Rebecca is aware of her problem, however, and tries to do better.  Her schemes for cutting back, saving money and making more money are downright funny, inventive and quite honestly, desperate.<br />Confessions of a Shopaholic makes it's mark.  One of the Top 10 best British novels I have ever read.  Definitely a pick-me-up if not a confessional for others who suffer from Overshopping Syndrome.  Will absolutely appease those who crave lighthearted, fun comedy with a message.  Two dollar-signs up!
B000001IQH|5.0|This a good punk CD.  If you adore The Get Up Kids and Jimmy Eat World, you'll love this CD.  It has this great punkish vibes, and I just love this CD.  There not like those punk bands, and then MTV turns them into pop punk.  No.  This CD is great.  My favorite track is, &quot;She's Automatic.&quot;   Yes, I know this a radio-crazed song, but I love it.  I love this CD.   Buy it today or burn it.
B000053SPI|5.0|Arrival is a pure rock album. New vocalist Steve Augeri sounds more like Jimi Jamison(Survivor) than Steve Perry. Many candidates having Steve Perry like voice such as Hugo and Kevin Chalfant(Two Fires) were not chosen and the new vocalist choice shows and the album resulted clearly says what Journey sound should be like. It is true that Steve Perry may do better jobs in some ballads such as All The Way, With Your Love and Lifetime of Dreams. But Steve Augeri's voice shines well in rockers such as Higher Place, I Got A Reason(my #1 favorite). So with Augeri's arrival finally Journey can rock really hard. This is somewhere between Hardline's Double Eclipse and Vital Signs(Survivor)/Escape(Journey)in hardness. A must for Survivor, Hardline, Sign, Two Fires and House of Shakila fans.
B00000IPAX|3.0|Blink182 were punk, and still are, but this cd isnt all that great! I love Blink182.  I've been a fan since Buhdda.  I will always be a fan, but this isn't their greatest work.  Yeah, Dumpweed is kinda punk, but the radio-loved song, &quot;All The Small Things&quot; shows how MTV have changed this punk trio.  I was disappointed with this CD.  I was expecting more punk sounds.  MTV and all teeny teen boppers changed their sound.  I still love Blink182, but not this CD.
0515125024|3.0|I have been newly acquainted with books like Die Trying.  I read Killing Floor first and was hooked.  In Die Trying I didn't feel as sucked into the drama as in Mr. Child's first book.  I think part of the reason that this book left me feeling different was that it was not written in first person point of view as in Killing Floor.  Also, I don't think that there was as much emphasis on the character Jack Reacher as in the previous offering.  Still, as you continue to read, you find yourself anticipating what will happen next.  I will continue to read Mr. Child's books.  I think that he has brought a unique vision to suspense writing and hope that he will continue to entertain readers.
B000002W5J|5.0|I'm a big fan of The Doors and Velvet Underground, but it wasn't until recently that I discovered Jefferson Airplane. I had heard &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; on the radio, however, I just never got around to listening to the rest of their material, I dismissed them as probably being a &quot;one-hit-wonder&quot; group... and what a mistake that was. Now I truly love them! Every song is great. I especially like Today, Comin' Back To Me, and She Has Funny Cars. Overall it's a jewel.
6300216268|5.0|i thought this movie had its funny moments but i did catch myself with a tear rolling down my cheek. this movie teaches you to love life and try to be free.
B000002IWQ|5.0|This a monstrously good rock record, one of the best I've heard. It was my first experience of Rush so i was not influenced by any prog rock preconceptions. I would recommend this to any fans of hard rock, as it has quality guitar all the way through, a classic solo and some of the best riffs I've ever heard, particularly Cut to the Chase, Everyday Glory and the epic Alien Shore intro. Uncompromising guitar and bass attack from the outset, with the very catchy Animate and Stick it out. Intellectual lyrical themes add to the power of the songs. Some devout followers of Rush seem to view this as inferior to the 20 minute stuff of their early days, I guess that's fair enough but to anyone who isn't too bothered about prog rock I would urge you to check this out, a fine moment in rock history, full of classic tracks. Get it and play it at a decent volume
0679879269|5.0|I started the trilogy with misgivings: the friend who recommended it said that it was &quot;better than narnia&quot;, something i was very reluctant to believe. The first two books, however wonderful and breathtaking and exciting they were, failed to live up to the 'greater-than-narnia' fame. After finishing the Amber Spyglass, however, i have become a convert. This book really IS better than narnia! I don't want to give away too much of the plot, so i'll just say that i wasn't able to put this book down for more than 10 minutes. I sat up long into the night trying to finish it and, at the same time, dreading the time when there will be no more book to read. That last page, for me, was something to long for and to dread at the same time.  I've heard the Amber Spyglass descibed as 'too dark, lacking a happy ending.' While i am one of the countless who wishes for happy endings (i spent the last few chapters of the book bawling), the book was the better for it-the emotion was breathtaking.
B000005H4K|5.0|This one is different.  Three titans - father, son and holy ghost - meet to pay their mutual respects and throttle each others' neck.  Actually Roach mostly frames the musical D-Day between Mingus and Ellington (I guess that makes him the holy ghost...). It's Mingus who is absolutely unrelententing, challenging Duke at every turn.  Even the quiet numbers seethe.  <br />What must Duke - the unflappable master - have thought at the sound of his musical progeny pounding like gangbusters at his heel?  Well he manages beautifully; in fact the longer I live with this album, the more I think that Duke gets the better of Mingus.  Maybe it's like bullfighting:  Mingus is the bull, Duke the matador, and though he risks doom Duke negotiates the beast with mere flicks of the cape.  <br />All of that said, this album is no &quot;showdown&quot;:  it succeeds as only cooperation between masters can.  (Though I promise you've never heard cooperation like this!)
B00004ZAV3|4.0|For some strange reason, Paul's Hofner is mixed low in the mix. Perhaps this is an effort to make the CD sound like a 45 without the scratches. This is a crime in the age of 24 bit sample rates. As a result of this approach, the tracks don't jump out of the speakers as the originals and subsequent CD's did. This is the sole reason this disc is not a 5. Considering all things being equal, if you already own these tracks in former incarnations, be happy with those. If you don't own a Beatles disc by all means buy 1 now. Hopfully it will garner new fans to the group us old-timers already knew were the best. Maybe you will even buy the original 13 disc's and learn what consistantly great songwriting and recording are all about. That's my opinion and I'm standing by it.
B000058T5E|5.0|When I first listened to this CD, it seemed a bit weird to me. However, over time, the CD grew on me more and more. Now, You Had It Coming is one of my favorite Jeff Beck albums. Nadia, Rosebud, and Suspension will definatley be the next Jeff Beck classic songs. I agree with the people that say You Had It Coming is up there with Blow by Blow and Wired. You Had It Coming certainly does live up to BBB and Wired. Well done, Jeff!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary Movie is a laugh-a-minute (or even second) movie, where the jokes keep coming and coming.  It spoofs so many movies that it's even funnier!  Don't worry about the nudity, you won't remember it that much, because you'll be thinking of all the jokes as they come your way.  People complain that Scary Movie has bad acting, or no plot.  H-E-L-L-O, what planet are you from, don't you think it's supposed to be that way, I mean it IS spoofing other movies.  Scary Movie gets the highest rating for being hilarious and also for the DVD having some cool features!

0345440757|5.0|Myself and my family cannot thank you enough for your book it is so well laid out and full of such wonderful information which actually works.  I have one three year old and a two month old and I wish your book was available three years ago.  I have read almost every popular baby care book out there and have found none to be as valuable as yours.  I bought your book last Thursday and true to your work the EASY plan worked in three short days.  I found your take on breastfeeding enlightening as I find there is so much pressure to breastfeed especially with my first and for as long as possible, now I am much more relaxed and don't think of formula in such a bad way as I once did.   I just cannot thank you enough our son is so much happier and is enjoying life along with the rest of us.  I hope you come up to Canada on your tour.  It is such a relief to know there is advice out there that can work.
B000050HTO|4.0|This is deffinitly one of his best  greatest hits cd's. Unfortionately its missing a litte. It would be nice to include some good famous live tracks like the 1966 &quot;Like a rolling stone&quot; at the Royal Albert hall, and &quot;Baby, let me fallow you down&quot;. Also its missing the very famous track &quot;I want you&quot;. and &quot;Stuck inside a mobile with the memphous blues again&quot;. I can go on and on how tracks are missing, but thats just my opinion, all together this is a cd worth buying for any bob dylan fan! and any new commers

0767817648|4.0|Blue Thunder is a good film. Not great, but good. It's biggest boost comes from actors Roy Scheider (Jaws) and the late Warren Oats (The Wild Bunch, Stripes). Warren Oats gives his captain role enough witty sarcasm to make other actors in kind take note. This was his last film performance. If your a fan of either actor that of it's self is reason to own the film. The Arthur Rubinstein music score also helps give the film a pulse (note: to give the music a haunting effect, Rubinstein placed a microphone in a water cooler bottle and set it underneath a Grand Piano while recording some tracks). <br />As for the story, it tends to lose the pace of the film at a point but that pales in comparison to other, more obvious flaws. Things like a boom mic in a shot, or continuity mistakes like that found in Lymangood's death (note: watch his hands). <br />The herald of Blue Thunder coming forward with the Pinkville sunrise in the background is just as menacing now as it was for a certain nineteen year old who saw it in '82. The climactic duel between Murphy and Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell) is also one of the films best moments even if it was imposible. There are little features to be had on this DVD, this might hurt any must-have-it-all collectors like myself, but for me one reason was all I needed to purchase Blue Thunder, ...memories.
1558216847|5.0|This book captured me and I took a long, long walk in a world far from my own.  I enjoyed every leg of the journey, from Siberia through the Gobi Desert and down into India.  Written well.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This film is one of director David Finchers' best.  The screenplay is unnerving with the way the movie shoots sequences at you.  And the perverse dialogue borders with such great films as Pulp Fiction and Hannibal.  Its a true anti-society masterpiece told with marvelous suspense!
B000056K04|5.0|&quot;Everyday&quot; is a great CD.  With grooves like &quot;So Right&quot; and &quot;Mother Father&quot; to the sweetness of &quot;The Space Between&quot; this CD has it all.  People who say that Dave sold out are the people that are unable to accept change.  If you like someone, you should like them for their writings and creativenes and be able to accept change.  This is why The Dave Matthews Band and &quot;Everyday&quot; rocks.
B000002UAX|5.0|&quot;A House Of Dolls&quot; was the original title to this piece of art. Indeed it is something like that. You can't find a concept in this bunch of varied and unique songs. During and after their trip to India, The Beatles had the time to explore new sounds and to find the authenticity that was lost in more sophysticated records like &quot;Sgt.Pepper's&quot; or &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. This variety of sources and sounds is what you can find inside the album.<br />Their exploration in the wide spectrum of the musicianship led them into unexpected fields. This album is a mixture of that variated and daring search, where sweet and acoustic straight pop tracks are mixed alone and together with electronic suites and symphonic arrangements, with unexpected and perfect percussion works and even a never-before-seen in the pop scene &quot;wall of sounds&quot;, which John Lennon called &quot;Revolution 9&quot;.<br />So this album has to be checked song-by-song, because, although it has come continuity and sense of &quot;concept&quot; (it begins saying &quot;I'm back in the USSR...&quot; and ends saying &quot;now it's time to say goodnight&quot;), the variety spectrum is really wide. The three main composers of The Beatles worked separately, and even some songs were recorded only with two of three of them present. So the title can even be considered as an irony...<br />Paul and John share equal number of songs on the album. McCartney's seen in all his faces. Rocking at his best with humour and irony (&quot;Back In The USSR&quot;, where he also plays drums and lead guitar), shouting his throat out (&quot;Why Don't We Do It In The Road&quot;) and making the strongest noise ever heard as music (&quot;Helter Skelter&quot;). His acoustic ballads are overwhelming for their sweetness. Linda appears as a distant figure inspiring him on &quot;I Will&quot;, he wishes to live a simple life (&quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;) and writes the greatest acoustic pop tune ever (&quot;Blackbird&quot;). Always criticized because of his weak lyrics, he laughs at himself making up non-sense third-part stories so well arranged that you can't complain: &quot;Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da&quot; and &quot;Honey Pie&quot; (together with &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot;) have excellent production; &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; is perfectly arranged to its country content, and &quot;Martha My Dear&quot; shows classical work. He and John share the credits for writing the rocking and screaming &quot;Birthday&quot;, which sounds like The Beatles having fun in the studio rather than a finished song. Astonishing.<br />John Lennon is the master of lyrics. &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; must be one of the highest points in his work, with delightful images and sweet poetry. &quot;Glass Onion&quot; and &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot; are both ironic tracks about strange themes, but always rocking. But if we have to talk about irony, &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; is a hidden message to the Maharishi, and to all the people who believe they have the &quot;cosmical solution&quot; to life's problems. &quot;The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill&quot; follows Paul's style of writing (third-part stories), but again the strange images into it made it a wonderful track. &quot;I'm So Tired&quot; is one of the best songs of all-time for its simplicity. The acoustic side of John is also shown here, with &quot;Julia&quot; (what a great poem transformed into a ballad!) and the bluesy version of &quot;Revolution&quot;. His rocking part is exhibited in &quot;Everybody's Got Something To Hide...&quot;, and the obvious Yoko participation on &quot;Revolution 9&quot; lets us with no words. The sweetest side of John, sending his son to sleep, is heard on &quot;Good Night&quot;, a song that Ringo sings perfectly.<br />George, as always, is left to only two songs on each disc. He manages to shine, though. &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; is the masterpiece of the album, with the important participation of Eric Clapton on the screaming lead guitar solo; &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; is a rocking track with funny lyrics; &quot;Piggies&quot; is one of the most original social comments ever made, transformed almost into a medioeval track; and &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot; is a wonderful acoustic pray from a man who has found God after losing him. Even Ringo writes a song, being &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot;, a country number notable for its rhythm cadences, his first released composition.<br />Variety within unity, and quality. That's what you find inside this album. If you consider that &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot;, together with &quot;Not Guilty&quot;, &quot;Junk&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;What's The New Mary Jane&quot; and &quot;Child Of Nature&quot;, were composed or recorded around the same time, you can say 1968 was a very creative year for The Beatles. This album is only a sampler of that creativity.
B00000ILDE|5.0|This rip-roaring sequal to the original &quot;Alien&quot; somehow manages to top that austere sci-fi classic.Directed by James Cameron,the hot-shot rookie who blasted out of the gate swinging with the original &quot;Terminator&quot; in 1984,this film more than expands on the original,it completely reinvents it,taking the scientific cues from the concept of the hostile,unstoppable,slime-oozing monster and giving it many,many brothers and sisters.This time out,it's not a small crew of oil workers in space that gets attaked,it's a colonized planet,complete with families.Howerever,going up against them is a crew of well-armed &quot;colonial marines&quot;(played by Bill Paxton and fellow Cameron stand-by Micheal Biehn,among others),along with Ripley,who agrees to join the marines and smarmy company man Burke,played by Paul Riser,on a mission back to the planet when they lose contact with the colony(it's a long story,buy the DVD and try to keep up).Suffice it to say that when they get there,they find more than they bargained for.Also suffice it to say,that this is probably the most riveting,stomach-churning,thrilling action film ever made,and Sigourney Weaver deserved the Acadamy Award nomination she recieved for the film;her performance is astonishing-rich,complex,brimming over with humanity and ferocious tenacity.On all fronts,an excellent film.
0790742780|5.0|Ok, I admit... I have a sick sense of humor. But at points I found this movie down right hysterical. It features the last person you'd ever expect to snap, an everyday white-collared business man, just go on a rampage whether with a baseball bat, hand guns, a shot gun, or even a bazooka. If you get a kick outta things that are sorta sick, you'd like this.
0790733226|2.0|Having read Carl Sagen's classic original novel several times and ejoyed it thougholy,I was looking forward to this adaptation.Unfortunately,my worst fears were realized,as I saw this was going to be just another glossy,easily-digested,pop-culture overhaul of the rich thematic sorce material.Where Sagan's work was an astonishingly thrilling and inspiring story of questions and searching,and the great wonder of everything we know and have yet to learn about what's way out there and deep inside,the film is simply an over-produced acting vehicle for Jodi Foster,who in my opinion was a poor choice to play the lead character in the first place(for some reason,I always though that Janeane Garafalo would have been ideal;she seems to me to embody both Ellie Arroway's tenacious contrarianism and her genuine passion for knowledge,plus she seems to more closely resemble Sagan's physical descripition of her).And the contrived romance between Foster and Matthew MacConaughey's Palmer Joss smacks of Hollywood interference;in the book the two characters never developed more than a grudging respect for each other.My advice to anyone interested is simple:read the book.
B000026258|5.0|I remember in 1979 watching on TV the concert film that accompanied the release of this LP.  I simply had to go out and buy the record the next day.  For me it somehow seemed to be the next extrapolation in a sequence that started with Mike Oldfield's TUBULAR BELLS and continued with Tangerine Dream's RICOCHET.<br />Mind you, the girlfriend I was staying with found it intensely irritating.  My wife's reaction has always been similar.  I know professional musicians who find Reich's music both extremely demanding and frustrating to play.  My children cannot believe that anyone would listen to Steve Reich's music out of choice!<br />It's impossible to sit on the fence about Reich's music.  Me, I just love it.  My LP got terribly worn, so it was a godsend when this CD version was released.  It is the better of the two versions I own -- I also have the Nonesuch edition -- even though the sound quality is not as good and the CD consists of just a single track.  The key reason for owning this version, apart from its place in music history, is that the piano on the best section (which starts around 26:00) is much more dominant in the mix than on the Nonesuch edition.<br />As others have written here, this is fantastic driving music, and it would certainly be in my Top Ten of CDs to take to a desert island.  Wonderfully hypnotic trance music.  Everyone ought to have a copy, but Amazon has made it difficult to find, hiding it in 'Classical Music' and not even filing it under 'Steve Reich'.
0671004107|5.0|There's not really much I can say about this magnificant work other than I've read it close to fifteen times,and I read something new each time.Packed within the thrilling,brisk narrative are amazing passages in which characters argue-intelligently,insightfully-about all the philisophical,theological,and scientific ramafications of actually making contact with another life-from.Protaganist Ellie Arroway is obviously an alter-ego of Carl Sagan,as she shares the same passion for exploration and knowledge as he did.He was one of history's great thinkers,and his influence and boundless enthusiasm for the very fabric of our existance will be sorely missed.Anyway,like I said,there's not much I could say to elucidate this classic story any further,just suffice it to say that if you're a fan of a great read,and enjoy asking questions and actually THINKING about things,then this is highly recommended.
B000056HOZ|3.0|This is truth in advertising to its extreme. The DVD has all of Bruce Springsteen's music videos. And that's it. No extras (ok, a discography, big whoop), no interviews, no commentary, not even some lousy titles at the beginning of the videos to introduce them. So if you like Bruuuuuce and want a collection of his videos on DVD, this is perfect. If you're expecting more from a DVD--and you should--it'll be a bit disappointing.
B000056K04|4.0|man was i shocked when an electric guitar came through my speakers.  initially i wasnt sure what to think, but as soon as i heard The Space Between and When the world ends i knew everything was going to be just fine.  it has now been about two weeks since the release and it hasnt moved from my cars cd player yet. the more i hear it the more i like it.  and for all you cry babies talking about dave selling out, i suggest you take a look at the rolling stone interview and shut the hell up!
B000056K04|2.0|this is like a Dave Matthews solo album his &quot;band&quot; is mostly wasted as just backup studio musicians. the album is very hit (&quot;fool to think&quot;, &quot;if i had it all&quot;, &quot;the space between&quot;, and &quot;when the world ends&quot;)or miss (&quot;I Did It&quot;, &quot;What You Are&quot;, &quot;Sleep to Dream Her&quot;). &quot;I Did It&quot; is probably the WORST song on the album and I really can't believe it is getting so much radio play!  If Dave had let his band play a little more it might have been a better album but instead we get him dominating the songs with his new found electric guitar and a desire to keep the songs short. new comers to the band get Under the Table and Dreaming or Crash 1st. oh and skip Before These Crowded Streets its utter crap this is at least a step up from that pile of dung.
0064471837|5.0|This book is amazing. I read this when I was 11, and although it took me a while, it was worth it. Don't let its size scare you off if you're not a big reader (or if you've never read a book that's about 500 pages), the pages turn quite quickly. I read the first 200 over a good block of time, but the remainder was read in a day.  If you're a fan of fantasy stories that deal with necromancy, demons, and magic, this book is for you. If you've played games like the Final Fantasies or Diablo, you may like this tale, too.  This book is probably suitable to those 10+, although at 10 it might be a little hard (not that the writing was difficult to understand).  One final note. This story mixes necromancy and magic with guns and 20th century warfare. Plot(super-condensed): Sabriel, an Abhorsen (necromancer), is on a journey to find her father (the previous Abhorsen- its inherited) and to fulfill her destiny by saving the world from a demon. By her side is the mysterious cat-figure, Mogget, and Touchstone, a man who...well I don't want to ruin the story...
6304639457|5.0|To many people, Fleetwood Mac is synonymous with one name: Stevie Nicks. And while her talent as a singer, songwriter, and performer are undeniable.. there is another name that comes to my mind... Lindsey Buckingham. This video is a spectacular showcase of his prowess as a vocalist and musician.. and proves that he only gets better with age. His voice, once high pitched and at times almost feminine, has gained a deepness to it that does far greater justice to his songs than ever before. Those people who only bought the CD are missing out on the best song of the set: &quot;Go Insane&quot; (one of five songs not included on the CD). Originally a dance track from his 1984 solo album of the same name, here it is stripped down to expose the heartache that was once hidden behind catchy beats. It is just him and his guitar and it will leave you breathless. Other stand out performances are &quot;The Chain&quot;, &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot;, &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot;, &quot;Big Love&quot;, and &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;.  It is easy to see why Buckingham's fans, and even many people who dismiss Fleetwood Mac as pure pop, consider him to be one of the greatest and most underrated guitarists alive today. And here you see him at his best.
B00000JCB2|4.0|It's good to know that there is still a little bit of talent left to hold onto from the shattered remains of their most recent, disappointing album; &quot;Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;. I still consider Significant Other to be the best of the band's three albums and to be a contemporary classic in the world of rapcore, no matter how many fans accuse this album of being the results of &quot;sellouts&quot; and that it sucked compared to 3 Dollar Bill Y'all$. If you compare this album to the first CD, which is 3DBY$, the music here is much more organized and thought-through. Fortunately this CD also has the gift of variety, so we're not stuck hearing the same chords over and over. Both hard rock and rap make this album what it is.<br />Both the &quot;Intro&quot; and &quot;Outro&quot;, though short and pretty much meaningless, provide some good bass for fans who really crave that in their music. As far as hard rock is concerned, &quot;Nookie&quot;, &quot;Don't Go Off Wandering&quot;, and &quot;Nobody Like You&quot; will do more than satisfy the fans tastes. The guitars and instrumental talent/effort put forth in all three pay off well. If you're into metal or even harder rock, this album has that as well. &quot;I'm Broke&quot;, &quot;Trust?&quot;, and the single &quot;Break Stuff&quot; are energetic, and while most likely not satisfying to the tastes of Pantera or Slayer fans, still give a good run for a hard rock fans money. As for &quot;9 Teen 90 Nine&quot;, that rides the fence between rock and rap, and does a good job of it.<br />For anyone craving quick beats and rap lyrics, &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; with Method Man is a nice addition, and &quot;Just Like This&quot; has some obvious rap influence. With all of the above said, some people may think that Limp Bizkit has no artistic or melodic side. Not true. The guitars are perfectly tuned, and the slower-paced and more melody-based songs such as &quot;No Sex&quot;, &quot;Re-Arranged&quot;,and &quot;A Lesson Learned&quot; are truly impressive. The last actual song on the album; &quot;Show Me What You Got&quot;, makes a good pseudo-ending track, and should have been a single itself.<br />Overall, this album has just about everything in the rapcore world covered, all the way down to the cover art on the CD case. Not to mention the guest appearances of Jonathan Davis from KoRn, Scott Weiland from the Stone Temple Pilots, Aaron Lewis of Staind, Method Man, Matt Pinfield, Les Claypool, and even Fred Durst's mother just before N 2 Gether Now. If you like rapcore, this is a must-have, and although it's a good album, it's not going to be one of those that will live on forever, which is the reason for it's lacking of 5 stars.

0553266306|5.0|I feel sorry for Freddy Forsyth. Never again did he (or anyone else for that matter) ever reach the heights set in this book. You KNOW that Charles de Gaulle died in his bed in his home village sortly after leaving office in 1969, so the book can have only one ending, but Forsyth keeps you turning the pages as the cunning Jackal and the tenacious policeman in pursuit match wits. I keep rereading the thing and the skill with which it is put together and worked out never ceases to amaze me.
B000004286|3.0|James Horner might have scored big with &quot;Braveheart&quot;, but I think that this music is one of the most repetetive ever.  It certainly has beautiful and heroic themes throughout this CD, but cues such as 'Revenge', and 'The Battle Of Stirling' reminded me of some of the tracks from &quot;Patriot Games&quot;: repetitive and tiresome.  It's kind of difficult to find out what to expect from Horner.
0385335482|3.0|For the first quarter of this book, I kept thinking, &quot;uh oh, I sure wasted my money on this&quot;. As one reviewer on Amazon.uk(giddily) put it - &quot;it's all about the shopping&quot;. Well, it sure is. And I got sick of it really, really quickly. It's not that I couldn't relate - I was like Rebecca once, making ends just barely meet from credit card bill to credit card bill. The story of a chronic shopper, who needs some direction and purpose (and self-control) is not a bad premise for this type of light romantic comedy. But I found it very hard to have any kind of sympathy or empathy for Rebecca at first. The story did start to move along and become more interesting about half way. Luke is prime romantic lead material and Rebecca actually DOES something besides shop. The supporting characters are amusing and just right for this kind of book... In other words - the story had the makings of a good one, but falls a bit short. Perhaps this is the editor's fault, not the author's. At the end of the book, I wasn't totally disappointed, but I didn't love it. If you are interested in British &quot;Chick Lit&quot;, you can do better. There's Jenny Colgan (Amanda's Wedding, Talking to Addison), Catherine Alliot, Christina Jones, Melissa Nathan,Robyn Sisman, and Fiona Walker. Having said all this - I think Ms Kinsella shows promise and I'd probably risk her next book.
B000056K04|3.0|One of the qualities of Dave Matthews Band that originally inducted me into their enormously devoted fanbase was their unique talent as a group of musicians.  Here was a band of five, who together created a unique sound of Rock, Jazz, Pop, Folk....DMB could really play any genre of music.  But what made their sound special was that they mixed these different styles into each song, they didn't just play one style per track.  If you listen to any of their previous albums, (including the live Listener Supported and Red Rocks), there are many layers.  On EVERYDAY, gone are the layers, gone is that unique sound.  Instead, DMB is offering a more mainstream generic style that is undoubtedly more pleasing to the masses (evidenced by the #1 Album ranking as of this writing) and much more radio friendly--all of the tracks under 4:44.  Though Dave was never the cleverest lyricist, on Everyday they're mostly superficial love songs.  There was a great spiritualness (not to be mistaken with religiousness) in his message which is now replaced with &quot;But will I hold you again? / These fickle, fuddled words confuse me / Like 'Will it rain today?' / Waste the hours with talking, talking / These twisted game we play,&quot; as opposed to the terrific &quot;Two Step&quot;: &quot;My love you came to me like wine comes to these lips / Grown tired of water all the time you quench my heart and oh, you quence my mind / ...Celebrate we will, life is short but sweet for certain.&quot;<br />Originally, the band had recorded an album in their traditional fashion--each member jamming in the studio to find their parts--but there was a sense of disillusionment with the final product.  So Steve Lillywhite was replaced with Glen Ballard, Dave packed up for a long vacation in LA and cowrote many of the songs with Ballard.  When the band returned to the studio everyone's parts were written out, which was apparently a relief and a pleasant surprise to all of the musicians.  No impromptu jamming, and it shows.<br />EVERYDAY is not a bad CD, it's just not what DMB fans have come to expect--it's different.  Definitely more commercial.  After listening to the album three times and wincing, I thought about it a little more and realized that if you listen back to all of the albums in in order, EVERYDAY is actually the natural progression that DMB would take, especially coming off of CROWDED STREETS.  I had hoped that perhaps the band would have gone in a slightly different direction, but there is still a familiar DMB sound in some of the tracks.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is definitely the most familiar sounding song, even still retaining some uplifting lyrics.  A few of the songs have grown on me, but the album is still a disappointment to me.  Carlos Santa is wasted on &quot;Mother, Father,&quot; and the narrator asks, &quot;Mother, father please explain to me / How this world has come to be so / Twisted between time and dreams / Oh, mother, father please explain to me.&quot;  A far cry from the terrific imagery and driving political statement of &quot;Don't Drink the Water,&quot; &quot;You say your father's spirit still lives in this place / Well, I will bury you. / Don't drink the water / There's blood in the water.&quot;<br /> To anyone who wants to know DMB more, I would recommend listening to their earlier albums, or getting the LISTENER SUPPORTED CD--one of the best live albums.  I suspect that serious DMB fans (like myself) will come to appreciate the EVERYDAY songs when we hear them performed live, where Dave Matthews Band really shines....if we can get tickets!it shows.<br />EVERYDAY is not a bad CD, it's just not what DMB fans have come to expect--it's different.

0385474547|5.0|Things Fall Apart tells the story of Okonkwo's life. The book gives an excellent feel for the life of an Ibo tribesman in the Nigerian bush. The reader learns of customs and taboos; how families relate and power is wielded; and how society deals with taboo violations. The impact of British Colonial rule also makes an appearance in this tale--leading to a conclusion which gasps with intensity. <br />But if this were all the book had to recommend it, one could easily ignore it as a mere window into the bygone lifestyle of a culture most of us can safely pay no attention to. Few of us will ever travel to occupied Biafra to eat yams and see the colorful clothing. The closest most of us will ever come to this environment is the Nigerian taxi driver who whisks us to the airport or hotel.<br />Okonkwo begins his life in shame. His father fails to provide well for the family. For the rest of his life, Okonkwo sets out to demonstrate to the world that he can do better. He works tirelessly, he accumulates degrees and initiation. He affords wives and children. <br />But, he finds little pleasure in this life. Angry, violent, he distances himself from the family who might have succored him. Still, driven by shame, he keeps working hard, trying to show the world that he is a force to be reckoned with. More yams! More wealth! Lead the village to battle! Stand firm &amp; strong.<br />Although his compatriots admire him, he fails to connect with them. Rather than allowing friendships to deepen, to find support and connection, Okonkwo continues to achieve, to compete, trying to surpass those who would have loved to be his allies.<br />This isolation, born out shame, leads to Okonkwo's demise. Achievement never leads to the community, to the connections and sharing, which allows shame to heal. Okonkwo was never able to feel a part of his community, and it cost him his life.<br />Isolation and shame are rampant in twentieth century western culture. The message we experience repeatedlytells us that our achievement will lead us to power and to happiness. The reality, as disclosed in Okonkwo's story, is that achievement does not create connection. Only the willingness to be vulnerable, to let another see into one's private spaces, will build the community and connection which can heal shame.
630027120X|5.0|I was surprised that a movie such as this ever made it through the Hollywood formula-driven system. The story it tells deals with extremes of human nature - the will to help others at great personal risk on one hand, and the common selfishness and short-sightedness (that ultimately results in disaster) on the other. I think the somewhat overt Christian themes turned off a lot of reviewers at the time it was originally released, but it's ultimately a story about humanity more than anything else. To give you an idea of its power, my wife and I left the theater without saying a word, got in the car, and proceeded to cry uncontrollably for about 20 minutes after viewing it (that had never happened before and hasn't since). One of the best movies I have ever seen, and it's haunted me for the last dozen years or so. ...

0316286850|5.0|Sure, the pictures are gorgeous and ofcourse no matter how hard I try at home, I'll never transform myself into Marilyn Monroe without a professional cameraman and hours of airbrushing, but thats not what I loved about the book in the first place. What I did love was Kevyn's easy going style and his loving personality that really came accross and touched me. He never once in the book made any reference to his immense talent... instead, he kept emphasising on the beauty of his subjects. A very refreshing approach by a very unique man. I'd love to meet him even if he wasn't half as succesful and famous as he is today. Dont get me wrong though, the pictures ARE stunning and you'll get a whole load of useful make-up tips. I guarentee though you'll finish loving the man more than his talent!
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica proved they could give variety in this album. Most of the songs are truly excellent, with incredibly impressive layers of music, especially in the classic instrumental 'The Call of Ktulu'. The songs 'For Whom the Bell Tolls','Escape', and 'Creeping Death' are some of the best metal classics to hit the 80s. 'Fade to Black' is one of my favorite songs. It's different stylistic approach could actually fall under the category of &quot;melodious ballad&quot;, which is something Metallica didn't have until now. The other songs are O.K. to good, but I don't have to push the &quot;skip&quot; button like some other Metallica albums. This album and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; are Metallica's most pounding pieces of work, and I highly recommend both to any die hard metal fan.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is great overall. You don't have to skip a stupid song because they are all good. It comines the heading-banging and sound of rock with rap. Not terribly hard screaming metal rock... the perfect mix. The band members of Linkin Park are extremely talented... they can sing unlike some other rock groups, could be the next backstreet boys if they wanted but they chose rock. This CD is worth the buy. And.. for the parents out there whose kids like rock and you don't like content this is a rock CD you can let your kids listen to without guilt. The subject matter is clean and you may have noticed that the cover doesn't say explict lyrics on the cover... thats because there are no explict lyrics maybe a couple not so friendly words but you can't really hear them. In conlusion- great quality cd and kid &quot;safe&quot;!!!
B000053GTE|4.0|Bonjour Celine fans. This VHS will be kept at close range on my shelf! I reviewed the CD, but I feel that the VHS has it made! Celine Dion's videos are touching, and her chameleonic style has followed her down the well travelled road of success. The duet &quot;To love you more&quot; is and will always be my fave. Celine sings this song with her famous on-key wailing, showing her lung power and talent.<br />The material from the CD of &quot;All the way&quot; shows Celine's softer vocals, weaving from throaty to angelic. I almost forgot it was Celine. Now I wish there'd be a new video, for her Collector's series CD. I am fortunate enough to credit celine for a wonderful video collection, even though I felt less about the Cd. Get this VHS while it's hot! Where can you get so many songs on cd or vhs/dvd for the money than from Celine? The VHS has more songs than the cd too, so there's more Celine to see until something new arrives!<br />I hope this review helps you, as I would normally mention all the songs on a review, but all Celine's videos are great. Even the fact that her lip-syncing is right on sync! I think that she's the most dramatic performer &quot;expression wise&quot;. After that, there's Whitney!<br />Go get the VHS. It's worth the dough! Did my review help you?
0385335482|5.0|Then again, maybe not. The heroine of this book , Rebecca, reminded me, oddly enough, of Winnie the Pooh, if Pooh had been set loose in a store - and if Pooh had found shopping as delightful as consuming a large pot of honey. Rebecca approaches stores the way Pooh approached a tree full of honey, ignoring the &quot;buzzing bees&quot; of guilt in her mind and the financial pitfalls and consequences of buying the most expensive, luxurious items. She has a sheer delight, even an innocent, naive delight in the sounds and sensations of shopping malls and unique little stores and can rationalize her way through even the most frivolous purchases, managing to ignore the creditors and bank managers who hound her for payments and (literally) show up on her doorstep.  The real irony in this tale is that Rebecca is a financial writer who actually understands much of the world she writes about. But, just like the perpetual dieter who gains weight while being able to recite the calorie count for every food out there, Rebecca has a hard time applying the financial wisdom she writes about. One of the funniest parts of this book is when she puts herself on a strict budget - and immediately buys the nicest notebook and other items to keep track of her(decreasing) finances.  The book is far from predictable, although I found it to be a quick read, a very enjoyable one. I'm sure many a reader will recognize himself/herself in this book, especially those of us who do like to shop.

B000002U82|5.0|Pink FLoyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is one of the albums that proves over and over again that the boundaries of music are limitless.  The album holds a special unique place in the universe of art.  Every sound, rhythm, and lyric furthers the albums story of life, loss, and death.  The whole album melts together to a heartbeat rhythm, with musical highs and lows.  From the swirling electronic soundscape of &quot;on the run&quot;, to the biting sarcasm and anger of &quot;money&quot;, to the final climax of sound where the message of the album comes full circle, &quot;dark side of the moon&quot; takes us on a aural and mental journey that is rarely found in Pop Music.  Pink Floyd were truly innovative and creative, pushing back boundaries and redefining the idea of music.  <br />For best results, listen with a good pair of headphones in the dark.
068484267X|4.0|Although I felt like things were bogging down about half way thru, I did finish the book. A friedn who reads tons of novels couldn't finish it, which surprised me.   McCourt tells a tale of deprivation and sadness, but not in a maudlin fashion. He manages to salvage some humor from whatever situation he recounts.
B000002VCE|5.0|Although recorded just after the departure of Henry Paul, which was a huge disapointment for me at the time. (I was awaiting a live album with H.P.)This is still a must have. From the opening, which is an electronic score (with Henry, they used the William Tell Overture)the build up to the guitar plug ins is apparent. The treasure here is Billy Jones last great live performance. His rendition of &quot;Prisoner&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot; are worth the price. Of course Hughie always shines. Together, they are rocks greatest guitar line up of all time. Also get the new album, So-Low. Pete.
B000002H33|5.0|&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is a must have for Metallica fans. This is the album where everything came together. It could very well be Metallica's strongest album, along with the &quot;black album&quot;. 'Master of Puppets' and 'The Thing That Should Not Be' are classic Metal anthems. 'Sanitarium' is an impressive &quot;ballad&quot; that is just as good as 'Fade to Black' from &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;. 'Orion' is one of the best instrumentals of the 80s. Every other song on this album is also good. There isn't a dull moment in &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. I also highly recommend the previous album, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, which also contains some of Metallica's best, most powerful songs.
B000021XS0|5.0|If you like this kind of music and you ever heard Dream Theater or any of this musicians, this album will take you to a Dream where you can find things that could ever happen in your own life. Try to live the experience of a regression and you will find out the sense and the meaning of this great production. I Think its the best album ever recorded about life. If I could give more star I will never have enough to give.
6304711905|5.0|This is my all time favorite western.Kurt Russell is superb in his portrayal of real life Lawman, Wyatt Earp,he looks very much like the real Earp and plays his role very sincere.Val Kilmer,what else can i say,he has one of the most famous lines in movie history,&quot;I'm Your Huckleberry.&quot;,his portrayal of the dying gambler Doc Holliday cannot be eqauled by the numerous Actors that played him before.The tension and hatred between Holliday and Johnny Ringo is a definate highlight and will keep you on your seat untill the final standoff.I won't give anything else away,but this movie gets better with every watch,Watch it,and relive the days of your childhood when you journey back into the old west.
078322687X|5.0|Too bad the transfer of such a great movie was so poor.  It looked like the studio mastered the DVD from a VHS tape that had been at the bottom of The Great Salt Lake for a decade.  Yeah, I love the movie.  It is a classic.  It just didn't seem like it was worth my money to buy the DVD; I already have a worn out VHS tape of it. The studio should be ashamed of such poor DVD quality!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is a very good, and clean rock-rap band. The songs are well writen and make since. Only problem is, they don't have a bass player, what is up with that?
B000002BQK|5.0|Every Mariah Carey fan should own this album, but so should every music lover...  This album could be Mariah's best (your opinion will differ from mine)... Butterfly has beautiful ballads, like &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;My All.&quot; It has dance songs, like &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Breakdown.&quot; It has hip hop songs, like &quot;The Roof.&quot; It has deep lyrical songs, like &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Outside.&quot;<br />as a Mariah fan I find this album the greatest ever, but as a music lover I find this album essential... It's kinda like 7 years in the making... Everysong tells about Mariah's musical journey, she keeps balads that she started out and moves around to upbeat songs she became famous for (&quot;Dreamlover&quot; and &quot;Fantasy&quot;)... But this is better, it's all of them put to together.  It's the most r&amp;b/hip-hop album Mariah has ever done, but it's deep and beautiful that any music lover will enjoy...
0782008372|5.0|I first saw this movie when i was 11 on tv and i loved it.i am now 14 and i saw it at least 7 times and i still love it.Mabye a mixed up plot still great.Like one minute your in new york next scotland.The best ending ever, classic music on the final sword fight cool flashing lights.Great movie.WATCH IT
B000002V0Q|5.0|In all respects. A very solid album, by one of (if not THE) greatest bands in metal. <br />This is a must have for all metal fans. <br />BUY IT! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
6305603847|5.0|The Wall itself rates 5 stars but the DVD adds dimension and depth after years of viewing it on an old VHS.  The only down side is the navigation tools are a tad slow to load but that is a minor gripe.  The commentary is well done and not overly obtrusive to the film.  It was very interesting to see both an old documentary and the new interviews done specifically for this dvd.  Excellent work.
B000002AVF|5.0|A lot of people may be scared to purchase Daydream... It's starts to show more of Mariah's r&amp;b/hip-hop side, but don't let that scare you... If you do, you will be missing out some great music... Daydream starts off with &quot;Fantasy.&quot; which was probably a huge step for Mariah's career, it is one of her biggest songs, and who doesn't love the sampling of &quot;Genius of Love&quot; by The Tom Tom Club, it's good for a bad day... Then the album moves into a beautiful love ballad, &quot;Underneath The Stars.&quot; It then continues into &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; which is a great song if you ever lost a love one, you will finally understand that life and death happens, but one day we will all be happy and together... Next is &quot;Open Arms&quot; a cover of the Joureny, which some people might not like, but Mariah fans love the cover songs she does... It really is a beautiful version of the song... The next song on Daydream is Mariah's biggest radio hit, &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; which is an uptempo ballad, it really is beautiful! next is &quot;I Am Free,&quot; which is a stirring ballad, I wanna cry already... moving on to the next track &quot;When I Saw You,&quot; another beautiful love ballad. &quot;Long Ago&quot; is a more urban ballad of love that once was, and never will be. &quot;Melt Away&quot; is a very r&amp;b love ballad, but you do notice this album is full of love, so why be scared to buy it? &quot;Forever&quot; is another love ballad, about love that will last forever. &quot;Daydream Interlude&quot; is the fist &quot;remix&quot; on a Mariah album, so those of you that don't like remixes might want to skip over this song. and the final song &quot;Looking In&quot; is a beautiful lyrical ballad of not fitting in, and who actually fits in?<br />the only way to really get the full message of the album is to buy it and listen for your self, but remember don't be scared, or you will miss something!
0783113943|5.0|I believe this to be a classic portrayal of &quot;Borderline Personality Disorder&quot;   It should be a lesson to parents that you can never love your children enough, or forgive them enough.  Money really doesnt make a person happy.  We all want mainly to be loved and accepted.  Excellent, sad movie.
B000056K04|3.0|OK, obviously there is very little common ground on this album.  People either hate it or love it.  I have very mixed emotions on this album.  As a loyal DMB fan I am dissapointed.  I love the acustic, and Boyd's violin and LeRoi's sax, and those are all missing on Everyday.  In addition, Ballard has over produced this album in my opinion.  DMB is at their best when the music just flows.  I really think that if Ballard had just run the tape a little more on each song this would be a better album.  However, the fact remains that this CD is much better then most of the music being produced today.  Yes, by Dave standards this is subpar, but when you think of it in comparison to the other music out there today, this is not a bad CD.  So I give it a 3, and will wait to see the songs played live, when DMB is at their best.
B000002ITM|5.0|This is the last album before Chuck Billy began singing with his new death metal style. You can truly enjoy the depth and power of his vocals. The songwriting is strong and the instramentals are pure Testament. This album's ballad, Return To Serenity, is haunting. I would recommend this album to anyone who wishes to sample this band at its best. Excellent from start to finish!
0440234743|1.0|How could a dead man write? John (Mr. Grisham), your first two chapters of the old billionair's autobiograhy has a flaw. When did he write this? I assume he must have written it after his death then because he wrote his last sentence &quot;Without looking below, I lunge over the rail.&quot; from a 14th floor. And he was obviously dead. And so, how could a dead man write? John, you must check with your editor on this. It seems no else on the Amazon review list so far notice it.
B00000099Y|5.0|TOOL is one of the few bands that havent gone commercial unlike korn,limp bizkit.etc,etc.this is an album thats hardcore gripping you by the balls.they define heavy heavymetal...there are many vocalists that try to scream...maynard screams with pure emotion which can be felt throughout this album.....pure emotion and anger thats heard in this album.i bought aenima in 96 and i still listen to it almost everyday without boredom ....its like listening to it for the very first time....he blends his vocals from whispers to screaming with pure emotion....im sure all tool fans can identify the intensity that i feel when i hear tool.
B000002GLE|5.0|For years now, this set has been among my favorites.  I love the group, I love the songs, I just love it all.  On my list as one I'd just have to have on a desert island.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is, quite possibly, the best collection of music ever assembled. It starts with the fast paced Blackened and then goes to the extraordinary ...And Justice For All, and then to the punch in the face that is the Eye of the Beholder. Next is my favorite song of all time, One, starting off quiet and slow but closing with lightning fast riffs that define all that makes Metallica great. The Shortest Straw and Harvester of Sorrow are both medium paced and heavy, but don't really stand out on this album. The Frayed Ends of Sanity captures the feel of insanity extremely well by using a series of quickly executed but spread out chords (not to mention the &quot;flying monkey&quot; song from Wizard of Oz). To Live is to Die is a ten minute tribute to late Metallica bass player Cliff Burton who died in a bus accident (Rest in peace, Cliff). The album closes with the fast paced Dyers Eve.<br />This is by far one of the best albums ever created and definitely Metallica's best. If you like metal at all (and maybe even if you don't) buy this CD immediately.
B000002G23|5.0|Depth in the explanation huh, detail is what is needed here, yes? Well, this music is fantasic, half in the bag (which I am) or straight as an arrow.  I have the box set (copied of course).  What an excellent, excellent, most quality  band.  Just something special is what this contribution to music ended up being...............
0375703764|4.0|When I first saw this book on the shelf, the cover struck me.  When I picked it up and flipped through the pages, the layout of the text indicated that something different was going on within House of Leaves.  To find out what, I plopped down the money (actually, I plopped down the magic plastic) and bought the thing.  <br />I found the book while browsing the horror section.  Even though there are adequate moments of the grotesque and arabesqe, the book is not bound within the genre.  Perhaps if Mr. Danielewski conceives another novel that transcends the genre, or if he produces a work outside the genre, House of Leaves will find itself in the more general literature section where we find other novels that can't be classified within a genre.  And the more famous and literate you are, the more likely that the literati will stop defining you.<br />This is not a novel for people who want to work while they read.  My wife tells me that Mr. Vonnegut would not approve of making a reader work like Mr. Danielewski makes a reader work.  (Mr. Vonnegut was not available to comment himself.)  However, Mr. Danielewski does provide some guidance and teaches the reader how to read the novel.  I won't go to the extent of comparing Mr. Danielewski to Joyce or Woolfe, but like writers before him who experimented with the way novels are written, he takes the time to ensure that the work is understandable.<br />House of Leaves shows both what is good and what is bad with &quot;academic&quot; fiction.  We know that Mr. Danielewski has stayed awake during his fiction workshops by evidence of all the nifty little tricks he employs.  But underlying those nifty tricks is good writing.  Without a solid base for writing, all the tricks would be lost and the end product would just be an exercise in overindulgence.  If I didn't have to turn the book around so many times to follow the text or read a footnote, I would have given House of Leaves five stars.<br />To get to the point: if you're willing to provide a little effort or if you're looking for something a little bit different, pick up House of Leaves.
0452282152|4.0|This book was as beautiful and as realistic as Vermeer's paintings.  I not only pictured Griet and her daily life, I felt her emotions, especially the longing she had for her employer.  Although I think Griet's ultimate destiny was predictable early in the story, I still felt the book conveyed a sense of what it was like to be a young woman in those times.  I could not help but believe that Vermeer's desire for Griet was the reason his wife kept getting pregnant!  The unfulfilled passion between Griet and Vermeer was so much more effective a means than having them yield to what both felt.  Tracy Chevalier has written a brilliant account of love that eventually is requited, but not in the way a reader might assume it would be.

B00000J2KT|5.0|Comming from a US MARINES view who has been throught the 3 months of hell, I would say of all the movies I have seen this is the closest you will ever get to seeing what it is like to be a Marine. Unless, you join and go through the actual bootcamp! Gysgt Hartman is a great actor, and knows his part, I guess after all, he was a actuall Marine Drill Instructor!!! If you are thinking about joining the Marines or you want to see what we had to do to earn the title Marine. Then, watch this film. It is a great classic movie.
B00004U45G|4.0|If you're a Led Zeppelin fan, you'll jump at any chance to hear Jimmy Page perform these classic tracks even if it is with another band, but as other bands go the Black Crowes do a very good job of backing page up. The arrangements stick pretty close to the original Zep songs so it all sounds familiar yet fresh since this is a pro recording and not some scratchy bootleg. I only wish more Zeppelin tracks had been included in the track selection, hence the four stars instead of five.
B00003CXSP|3.0|I think that this movie, is no a movie you want to watch, with your little kids. This movie, has some very gross pictures in it! There is a scene that he opens a guys head and eats his brain!!! That is the worst one of all!! I like scary movies, but this is a SICK movie!! The begining of the movie is ok and i actually liked it for the most part until the end!!!!!

0441172717|4.0|I have now decided only to do book reviews. I have now 50 reviews, and I don't like at least 30 of them. Now, I will only do book reviews.<br />Anyway, I finished Dune in about 6 days. Wow, this book is a astounishing story about Paul Mua'dib Atriedies, who brings down the Harkonennes and becomes the greatest Duke of Atriedies of all time.<br />Good job keeping the story together. It got a little confusing near the end of book 2, but I managed to know what was happening. I saw the Mini-series before the book, so I'm not that fond with it. I think the Mini-series made up some parts to keep the viewer intrested. Just a little warning before you see the mini-series.<br />The book is just great, and the 1984 movie is just terrible. I can't believe I watched it! My favorite charecter in the book were Stilgar and the Fremen. Good book.<br />Rating:11+ has viloence, language, and sexual conduct.
6303269826|2.0|All of the attempts to expose the rest of Wyatt Earp's life are diminished if not ruined by the blatantly false portrayal of the Earp's and Holliday as &quot;lawmen.&quot;<br />The famous &quot;gunfight&quot; was little more than cold-blooded murder carried out by the Earps, and the attempt to somehow portray the Earp's as heroes is an embarassment. The Clanton/McLaury gang were cattle rustlers, but did that justify their being gunned down in cold blood? Tom McLaury was unarmed but still shot and killed by the Earps. Ike Clanton and Billy Clairborne were both unarmed and ran away, but still the cowardly Earps took shots at them.<br />There were no &quot;good guys&quot; in the &quot;gunfight&quot; but there were players who were more in the wrong than the other, and those were the Earps. It's too bad that this movie didn't accurately portray this.
B000001EAQ|1.0|I am a HUGE U2 fan.  I just wanted to state that before i start the bashing of this cd.  This cd is truely just a mixture of sound effects.  It has no rythmn!  I don't understand how U2 could have put out a cd like this even if it was experimental, this is just trash.  Please do not waste your money on this.  Go out and buy Joshua tree, Achtung Baby, or All that you can't leave behind. Almost any other u2 cd is better than this!
B000002G7G|4.0|this is the last great velvet underground album (i really didn't care for, 'loaded'), and i think it is also their strangest, which is odd since most of the songs are just mid-tempo rock songs.<br />candy says - this is a song where doug yule (john cales replacement) sings. it's damn gorgeous, but drags a bit.<br />what goes on - this funky little rocker is a lot of fun, and it is one of the strongest songs on the album.<br />some kina love - once again, a very languid, pretty song. <br />pale blue eyes - the best song on the album!!!! it's a very soft, sweet, genuine lullabye, and it's unquestionably on of lou reeds most brilliant songs ever.<br />jesus - this song isn't very memorable<br />beginning to see the light - this song is one of the few rockers on the album, and, needless to say, it is one of the most consistent.<br />i'm set free - more languid beauty<br />that's the story of my life - again, a not very memorable song.<br />the murder mystery - this is a great song, and it is also the oddest on the album. every member of the band sings on this one, and the peculiar keyboard parts compliment their voices.<br />after hours - i never realized just how pretty mo tuckers voice was, and i compliment both her and lou reed for giving her such a great song. this also was the song that introduced me to tuckers solo career.<br />even though this is a really good album, i would sooner reccomend their other two, 'white light/white heat,' and especially, 'the velver underground and nico.'

This one is not quite as good as ACoK, IMO, but is still worthy of five stars. <br />I'm sure by now you've read most of the reviews so I'll summarise quickly:Amazing writing; better character development than the previous two; Jaime Lannister and Samwell Tarly(yay!) get viewpoints;bad and good guys alike, die. The book all around wasn't as good as the first two, but had some of the best individual chapters in the whole series. Mostly with Davos, Arya, Jon and especially(!) Tyrion; trust me on this one. <br />A definite read, some questions are answered from the previous books also. If you haven't started this series, pick up AGoT now! Can't wait for A Dance with Dragons!
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is definitely one of my top 5 all time favorites, definitely one I would take to a desert island. Though it's not quite as heavy as the Chili Peppers from the Blood Sugar Sex Magic era, it's still awesome from start to finish- Dont have to skip a track! There's the 4 great singles Scar Tissue, Otherside, Around the World, &amp; Californication, plus Paralell Universe, Road Trippin, I Like Dirt, Get on Top, and well, just stop listenin to me babble and BUY THIS CD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000214F2|3.0|Robin Williams looks absolutely nothing like Patch Adams.  That's one downside.<br />However, I question that every bit of this movie is true.  Most of it is probably over-dramatized.  In other words, it probably stretches the truth a little.<br />It wasn't a bad movie, altogether.  It was somewhat inspiring...except for one thing.  Where does this guy come off blaming God for all of his problems?  I was sickened to see him stand on the edge of a cliff and shake his fist towards heaven, a look of hatred on his face, defiantly growling to God, &quot;Why didn't you create compassion on the seventh day?&quot;  This is pure blasphemy.  It would have been more entertaining if, having completed this statement, he was struck by a lightening bolt.
B00003W8NM|3.0|**sigh** This movie depresses me, not because it's sad or mean-spirited, though it certainly is the latter for much of the film, but because many people just don't get it.  &quot;It was fascist!&quot;  &quot;It was chauvanist!&quot;  &quot;It was misleading!&quot;  Most of these comments boil down to, &quot;It made fun of me!&quot;, in which case one may certainly be right.  The film is thoughtful and violent on a much deeper level than quasi-philsophical fare like The Matrix, but it's ultimately optimistic.  There's a lot of parody to the movie, but there's also a lot of serious social commentary.  Fight Club is dangerous.  That much, everyone can agree on.  Much whining takes place concerning the film's apparent lack of social responsibility, but all Fincher does is address the obvious.  Yes, there are disenfranchised American men everywhere, and they need more than they have.  Fight Club is the other side of the American Beauty coin - sex is one issue that is coming to a head, aggression is another.  An eerie similarity in the 'resignation' scenes in both of these movies proves that point.  Jack may not like women, but Marla is more than he bargains for and surprises him to the point that he risks everything he has for her, pitting himself against his role model, Tyler.  The violence here is painful, that's true, but I much prefer the honesty of Fight Club's non-lethal beatings to the kinetic, casual cruelty of The Matrix's now-infamous Lobby Scene, in which at least thirty people are brutally killed.  This is, again, the perfect companion peice to American Beauty.  Watch Fight Club, and think.
B00000099Y|5.0|There really isn't much more to say ... there are almost 500 reviews about how this is one of the greatest if not the greatest musical performance of all time. It is lyrically genious, deep, moving and mind-blowing. From drums to bass to guitar it is musically perfect and unbeleivable. Maynard is the greatest singer. He captures you with his barely intellgible whispers and his beautiful soft singing, and he makes your blood run cold with his screams. This CD is perfect when your in any mood, it will open you up and free you from any problems or worries. But the most important thing about this beyond the fact that it is like no other music you will have ever heard before, is that it never EVER gets old or stale. Anyone who owns this album and all other Tool albums can testify to that. The more you listen to it the better it gets until you are so absorbed by it that you can't remember a time when it wasn't part of you. There are so many bands that are great but they fade away sooner or later. TOOL will not fade away but will grow forever. They are not mainstream, they do not release an album every year to keep up their image, repeating the same old formulas. The write organically and with every effort they push themselves farther than anyone has ever attempted and if you own their three albums you can see this. Their next album LATERALUS will be so different yet so perfect. For those who have been patient for the five years since this album TOOL will reward you with a masterpeice of music that although hard to believe will leap as far beyond AENIMA as AENIMA from OPIATE. Listen to it or not, but if you do listen to it and see it for what it is, you will be changed significantly.
079073382X|4.0|&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; is a small film but a charming and rewarding one. Celine, a young Frenchwoman, and Jesse, a young American, meet on the train from Budapest to Vienna. Jesse has 14 hours before he must board his plane back to America; he persuades Celine to spend that time with him wandering around Vienna; they spend the time talking, meeting various eccentric Viennese, and falling in love. In the morning they part, probably never to see each other again, although they vow that they will. That's all there is to it, but it's delightful, thanks to Richard Linklater's savvy writing and direction and the sweet performances of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. The dialogue captures perfectly the thoughts and personalities of two intelligent, thoughtful but not-quite-mature young people, and Linklater's camera takes us on a panoramic tour of Vienna (including several sites immortalized by an earlier, much darker film set in Vienna, &quot;The Third Man&quot;). What is most affecting about Before Sunrise, however, is the poignancy and urgency it gains as Celine and Jesse's time together comes to its inevitable end. Jesse's quotation from W.H. Auden--&quot;O let not time deceive you,/You cannot conquer time&quot;--is most appropriate, and as touching an endorsement of the philosophy of &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; as has ever been put on screen.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Seems as if so that people hearing this album would expect some more stuff affiliated with Jagged, especially lyrically, and there are some elements, but this album seems more mature...and come on, let's face it...Alanis is around 27 now.  She is maturing right along with her music, which makes it a good thing and very hard to see in music.  Like Everclear...those guys are in their thirties with high schoolyard settings in the background of their videos, pretty much saying, &quot;I relate to your pain and insecurity...while I'm at it, please buy this record because I understand you&quot;  Alanis did not do that with this album and she's moving on well, which the lyrics display.  Also with her mouth showing on the cover is pretty tongue in cheek humor, b/c a lot of people have pigeonholed Alanis as a bigmouth, which maybe she was making fun of it...then again, what do I know?  I just thought it fit the album well. From a sales perspective, it took guts to make and write something like this.  Anyway, I highly suggest this album very much.  Artistically, lyrically and maturely, this album blows the doors off of Jagged.
B000002GC2|5.0|I have many cd's by Quincy Jones, but this is my favorite!  Sounds ranks at a close second, but when you get right down to it, this is the one.
B00000099Y|5.0|i didn't always like tool. in fact, i can clearly remember the first song i heard - it was aenema, and i was sitting in the car outside a liqour store waiting for my friend. before that night, i listened to mainstream pop stations - mostly mindless bull s**t that is incapeable of stimulating your mind in anyway.  since that night, i haven't gone back.  This album, and this band are absolutely unbelievable.  The growth, both musical and lyrical, from opiate to undertow finally to aenima &lt;and their new release this april &gt; are unsurpassed by any other band, ever.  Their sound is so distinct that it would be impossible to compare them to Zepplin or Floyd, great bands though they are, as so many critics have tried to do. Their lyrics provoke thought, but the guitar riffs and heavy bass can totally carry you away. A relatively small but faithful following knows this first-hand.  Pity for the rest of the ignorant, oblivious population.
B0000542D2|5.0|It's amazing how many people at my high school like the Beatles.  I think there are more Beatles fans at my school than there are Backstreet Boys or N Sync fans.  The Beatles even made more money last year (mostly due to the &quot;1&quot; CD) than either of those bands!  They're the hottest band again; something that I never thought I'd see happen, ever since I first heard them about 10 years ago when I was 5 years old.  Plus I don't think most people realize The Beatles and director Richard Lester were pioneers of what would eventually become music videos, with this movie and &quot;Help!&quot;<br />But anyway, about &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; it's funny looking back and remembering that I didn't even like the movie when I first saw it.  I guess I just didn't get it.  I was young; I guess I thought that The Beatles would be in a serious movie or something.  And I didn't get the humor either.  But now, a few years later, it's one of my favorite movies in the world.  I absolutely love it!!!<br />The Beatles are surprisingly good as actors.  In my opinion, Paul was really trying to be a good actor the most.  Look at the scene early in the film where they're in the hotel room and the grandfather has the line about &quot;invites to gambling clubs!!&quot; Paul is also in the shot; look at his face; he's trying so hard to look real in the situation (sort of a &quot;reaction shot&quot; or something) while the grandfather is speaking.<br />Also, Ringo has some of the best lines.  I love when he says &quot;There ya' go! Hiding behind a smokescreen of bourgeois cliches!&quot;  It's so funny, because the script has so many exaggerated parodies of what they really say!<br />I've been waiting for an exceptional DVD transfer for a few years now.  I hope this is it.  It should have the original mono soundtrack on it.  One reason I say that is, the stereo version of some slight differences in the songs.  For example, in the stereo mix of &quot;If I Fell&quot; Paul's voice audibly cracks.  Also, is it me or are a lot of the songs slowed down? I guess when they filmed The Beatles lip-synching to the songs, the tape was at the wrong speed or something.  Anyway, I also hope to see better DVD's of &quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; really soon!!!
B000056K04|5.0|WOW!!! The first thing which pops to mind. One of the most dedicated Dave fans in the world I anxiously dreaded the release of this album. So much negativity about how different it was. After hearing the CD, the difference is what makes this ablbum ROCK! What Dave does the same. He tangles the lyrics of all his songs on this album with beautiful one liners that one has always been able to pull out of any Dave song and carry it with them forever. The content within the music is still caracteristically Dave... the only thing different... they just plugged him in. For a Dave fan... it is one of the best ablums he has ever released... my suggestion is to understand that as an artist, he has only shown us another side to his mind. Why should we hate the opportunity to see something so wonderful. For non Dave fans. This is the album that will change your mind!
0812589041|3.0|I read this book in three days.  It was an easy read, and the story was involving.  The major complaint people seem to have is that they find the circumstances of young child geniuses acting this way unbelievable.  If you're going to read this book, you ought to be able to enjoy the book and accept what the author gives you suspending your disbelief.<br />Many people, including myself, will identify with the characters.  Ender is a young genius, isolated, manipulated, and burdened with a destiny to save the human race.  His discovery and management of his dark side, a major theme, I found to be less involving, and I think that is the fault more of the author.  Overall, I would say the major flaws are that the book does get a little repetitive (ok, now he's playing a different game after game after game), Ender's &quot;genius&quot; strategies don't seem so spectacular, and the psychological development of the major characters is a little lacking.  However, there are enough of the classic archetypal qualities - the mentor, the destiny, good vs evil, the rite of passage, the quest - that I can recommend it, especially to teenagers and children who want an involving science fiction story and who may not care so much or know so much about the good quality of the literary craft and manipulation of words.  This book is long on plot, but short on heart or poetry.
B000000WZ4|5.0|Most of the Depeche Mode cds I had prior to this one were from their time in the 80's, so I was a little weary of whether or not this album would live up to the rest.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  If Depeche Mode has changed any throughout the years, its only for the better! Each and every song on the cd has that classic Depeche Mode tinge to it, but with an underlying new flare.  I very much enjoyed this entire album and urge any Depeche Mode fan...whether just getting introduced to thier music or being a long-time fan...to buy Ultra.  Some of my favorite songs on it are Home, Useless, and Freestate.  Go buy it!  You won't be disappointed.
B000002UAX|5.0|Paul often explains the Sgt. Pepper concept as an attempt by the Beatles to retreat from their old identities to don musical disguises.  This amazing album, the true follow-up to Pepper, found the Beatles redefining who each of them was.  <br />A few other points:  1) First off, Lennon and McCartney largely abandoned the traditional songcraft they were so good at after the &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot;/&quot;Penny Lane&quot; single.  John hit his peak on Rubber Soul; Paul on Revolver, and of course each on the sides of that single.  Hereafter, they would generally approach songwriting (and record-making) in terms of innovation, whimsical novelty, and in John's case, wrenching self-expression.  The songs would not succeed on their intrinsic merits qua songs, but upon those new, &quot;rock&quot; criteria.  Pretty much EVERY song on the White Album with the specific exceptions of &quot;Dear Prudence,&quot; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; and &quot;Julia,&quot; are NOVELTY SONGS in some sense or another (e.g., &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; and &quot;I Will&quot; because of their elliptically ironic whimsy and somewhat off-handed mood - and yes, &quot;I Will&quot; is beautiful, but not in the same way &quot;Here There and Everywhere&quot; or &quot;For No One&quot; is -, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; because it is a genre experiment).  That their material remained so good in spite of that is a testament to Lennon and McCartney's colossal talent and chemistry. Novelty songs, yes, but this stuff still conveys an amazing emotional range, infinitely moreso than some of the cutesier dreck on Pepper (&quot;Fixing a Hole,&quot; &quot;Mr. Kite,&quot; &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot;).  Unlike the previous three albums, which were only hurt by the omission of their singles, it is a good thing &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was left off, because it does not fit this overarcing novelty/scrapbook kind of approach.  It would have overwhelmed the other tracks.<br />2) Many look upon this album as a preview of the Beatles' solo careers.  It is only such because of the new post-Pepper mindset I discussed above.  Each songwriter was generally doing his own thing as far back as Beatles for Sale, with several notable exceptions (&quot;We Can Work It Out,&quot; most of the better songs on Pepper).  <br />3) While John asserted something of a greater artistic stature than Paul here, it was Paul turning so much of this album to gold with his spectacular bass playing, harmonic innovation, and surprisingly frequent drumming and piano-playing, not to mention his generally more cheerful outlook and appreciation for spritely pop tradition.  On this album perhaps more than any other, there is some resonance to the bogus cliche that &quot;John was the lyrics, Paul was the music.&quot;  John's passionate self-expression (which certainly wasn't all about lyrics) and Paul's musical genius complemented each other perfectly here.<br />The White Album embraces a unique production/performance ethos that combines a kind of rough-hewn, clunky, brash instrumental style (meaty bass, bashing drums, rudely squawking electric guitars contrasted with acoustic strumming) with burnished studio gloss and frequent usage of horns and other non-rock approaches.  It is VERY much a 1968 album in its &quot;return-to-roots&quot; attitude (like Music from Big Pink, John Wesley Harding, Beggars Banquet, Sweetheart of the Rodeo, and the first stirrings of CCR), but remains timeless in its emotional impact.   It's hard to imagine an album that crams more genres into one space - Zeppelinesque heavy metal (&quot;Helter Skelter&quot;), Gatsbyesque '20s pop (&quot;Honey Pie&quot;), album-oriented classic-rock (&quot;While Eric Clapton's Guitar Gently Weeps Because He's a Lot Better Than I Am&quot;), celebratory party-rock (&quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.,&quot; &quot;Birthday,&quot; &quot;Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey&quot;), avant-garde doo-wop (?!?! &quot;Happinessis a Warm Gun&quot;), acoustic folk (&quot;Blackbird&quot;), confessional singer-songwriter testimony (&quot;Julia&quot;), proto-grunge angst-rock (&quot;Yer Blues&quot;), a sound collage (&quot;Revolution 9&quot;), a schmaltzy follow-up to &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; for Judy Garland to sing (&quot;Good Night,&quot; by John of all people), etc. etc.  Everyone has their faves; mine, in order of their appearance on the album, are &quot;Dear Prudence,&quot; &quot;Martha My Dear(great, typically McCartneyesque pop arrangement),&quot; &quot;I Will,&quot; &quot;Julia,&quot; &quot;Yer Blues,&quot; &quot;Mother Nature's Son,&quot; &quot;...Monkey,&quot; &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; &quot;Savoy Truffle (George borrows John's wall-o-saxes from &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; to cool effect),&quot; &quot;Cry Baby Cry,&quot; and &quot;Good Night.&quot;  On the other hand, it's such a joy to track through the whole thing.  This is the Beatles second best studio album after Revolver.  Purchase and enjoy a great work of art.

B000002UAI|4.0|&quot;Eight Days a Week.&quot;  Paul is usually credited or blamed as the Beatles' popster, but it was JOHN who confected this tasty piece of ear candy.  One of the Beatles' absolute-best pre-Rubber Soul pop gems.  You must have it.  If you intend to do so by legal means, you must either purchase this disc, or the rip-off Red album.  Regardless of what you think of the rest of the material on this album, you're going to have to get Hard Day's Night, Help!, Rubber Soul, and Revolver anyway, so you might as well spring for this.  And &quot;No Reply&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing&quot; are certainly worth having anyway.
B000002GQK|5.0|From a '60s &amp; '70s hippie artist chick... Nice To Be Here was the &quot;wabi&quot; (from Japanese aesthetics)-- the irregularity in the pristine work which makes it beautiful and emotionally accessible.  It still brings us to a silly and magickal mirth!<br />Nice To Be Here, although seemingly naive, was widely understood by ancient couch surfers to be a wink-and-a-nod to psychotropic atonement sessions with the Greater Nature... the Inner Child before Self-Help movements... Mescalito amusement states.  And it does have that fae b/w early cartoon thing concerning teacups dancing, spoons in a conga line and mice playing daffodils! <br />How could the Moodies be flawed in their artfulness? Coming, as it were, straight from the soul.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I like all kinds of music, from hardcore to rock to ska to jazz to basically anything out there, but I've never liked rap.  That is, until I heard this CD for the first time.  After hearing it in my friend's car, I went out and bought it, and it quickly became one of my favorite albums.  Sure, it's crude and often offensive, but so what?  I've listened to this CD dozens of times, and I never once got the feeling that Eminem takes himself seriously.  So I don't think his fans should take him seriously either, and for the most part they don't.  <br />On his last LP, Eminem created the persona of &quot;Slim Shady&quot;, an offensive jerk that represents all of the problems in society (homophobia, hatred towards women, etc.).  But the American public, being incredibly ignorant as it is, took this the wrong way and thought that Eminem himself was a wife-beating homophobe.  On the &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, Eminem shows us that he is a real person, not to be confused with fiction.  Of course, people still don't get it.  All I can say to these people is; your loss.  You're missing out on one of the greatest artists of our time.<br />This is similar to the controversy over James Joyce's classic novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;.  It was viewed as obscene and even pornographic when first published, but it is now considered one of the greatest books ever written.<br />One more thing... No matter what anyone tells you, the edited version is not better.  While the edited version does have &quot;The Kids&quot; (which is a great song), it's not worth the compromise.  &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; is a work of art.  If you can't stomach it, then don't listen to it.  A watered down version is not better.
6305127689|5.0|I have read quite a few poor reviews from this movie from people who are unable to occasionally shut off their brains and just enjoy an exciting action/adventure with some element of love story.  &quot;Top Gun&quot; is one of my favorite 80's films.  Director Tony Scott is a genius, and it appears to run in the family (his brother is Ridley Scott of Blade Runner fame).  Stunning aerial sequences, amazing cinematography, a rocking musical score and good acting combine to make this a fun, exciting film -- as long as you don't try to analyze it.  Yes, the plot is simple and predictable, yes there are numerous goofs and continuity errors in the film (you won't notice if you're not looking for these).  Huge at the box office in the 80's (I was there!), this is the film that made Tom Cruise's career.  If you see this, I recommend seeing it on DVD with a large screen and good sound system, as it will blow your socks off.  On a regular TV screen with poor speakers, this film loses alot of impact.  Bring a date :-).
B00005214X|5.0|Although I am a great beatles fan I must confess that I never really gave George the credit he deserved. Sure we all remember songs like &quot;something&quot; but for some reason his immediate &quot;post beatles&quot; works never really stayed in my mind. This collection has certainly changed my view and I owe George an apology for neglecting him. This album oozes with George's talent and musical expertise. I remember most of them as if they were recent releases. Sure there are a few tracks that seem a little overindulgent but overall this is a first class work, well reproduced. Worth a try
6304981635|4.0|Considered a classic by many, it's an entertaining American-made martial arts movie (esp. as a martial arts movie, as U.S. standards go at the time), if only because Bruce Lee's moves are so quick, and has great screen charisma.   Sure, plotwise, there's not much here, but that's not the driving force of the movie, for that matter.  Although watching it nowadays, there's an entertaining campiness fun with the now cookie-cutter characters, the lingo, and the styles that are fun to watch in that 70's sort of way.  Everybody now like to say the famous &quot;Man..you come right out of a comic book&quot; line.  The downside is that Bruce Lee doesn't really get to fight as much as in his other works (eg.&quot;Chinese Connection&quot;) due to plot and semi-interesting characters.  DVD has some interesting extras and a little bit of documentary.  For a DVD, I found the extras to be well-done.
0811826848|5.0|If you are a music fan then you must own this book. It provides an encylopaedic history of what was arguably the most innovative and creative group of all time While some of the &quot;meat&quot; contained in individual biographies of the band's members is missing it is still a great work with a lot of valuable narrative/interview material. It flows very well for such a complex subject and the quality of the writting is first class.  The book itself is beautifully produced on high quality materials and the pictures are extremely well produced and include a lot of items I have never seen before, ( and I have quite a collection of Beatles material in my library) I was thrilled to receive this as a gift buy it!...
B000002ORU|3.0|For a band to obtain such a high status as the Who have, they sure had some crummy treatment from their record companies with numerous substandard compilations. 30 Years Of Maximum R&amp;B was an honest attempt to try to set the record straight but there are some problems with it. There are 79 songs on the box set but at least five of them are edited down from full length. They are: Jaguar, Shaken All Over, Bargain, Dreaming From The Waist, and Who Are You (which is NOT the single version it proclaims to be; I know because I have the single). Furthermore, A Quick One, While He's Away and See Me, Feel Me both alternate between live and studio versions in the same songs. Happy Jack also is not the single version but an alternate version with a different drum track. And for those who are looking for the studio version of Substitute you won't find it here. On the plus side there are a number of unreleased live tracks where the Who really shines, among them Naked Eye, Dreaming From The Waist, and My Wife. There are also unreleased studio tracks, studio banter, and live verbal diatribes with the audience (there's even the assault, both verbal and physical, between Pete Townshend and Abbie Hoffman at Woodstock!!). And there's the awesome full length version of The Kids Are Alright which is finally available in the U.S. Personally, I would drop a couple of unreleased tracks to get the full length version of the above mentioned songs. Still, I suspect it will appeal to completists who have everything else and will want the unreleased stuff. But for those who want the hits I suggest picking up My Generation-The Very Best Of The Who which delivers the hits, and then explore other cds (Tommy, Who's Next, Live At Leeds) to get better examples of what this great band has accomplished.
B000056VIY|4.0|J. Lo is a great album. There are many styles on it, with RnB being the focus. The cd features many single worthy songs, including Love Dont cost a Thing, Play, Dance with Me, and my fave, That's not me. Each song has a completely different, cool beat to it. You can dance, relax, sing, and do just about anything with Jennifer's music. I consider this cd one of my Top 10's.

Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most complex and intreaging fictional characters of all time.  If you like this book you will definetly like the movie You've got mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
B000001DTM|5.0|In a word: staggering.  I don't know if I've ever heard an album which can even come close to capturing the kaleidoscope of sheer emotion that floods from these twelve songs.  Just as Alice in Chains dragged us to the pitch black depths of heroin-addiction with &quot;Dirt&quot;, U2 does the same, only with lost love and heartbreak as the backdrop.<br />Amidst the gloomy themes of the album, rays of hope still shine through in the form of The Edge's signature effect-soaked licks and some serious head-bobbing rhythm from Clayton and Mullen. The great thing about this album is its accessibility:  it literally has it all. Techno/hip-hop/rockers like &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; and &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot;, and the arena-friendly chorus of &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; will bring a smile to the face of mainstream (and hardcore) U2 fans, while deeper, more experimental fare such as the industrial-tinged &quot;Zoo Station&quot; and the indescribable guitar orgasm of &quot;The Fly&quot; will challenge the listener on their inaugural spins but eventually yield rich rewards.  The heart and soul of the album, however, lies in three songs...&quot;One&quot;, &quot;Acrobat&quot;, and &quot;Love is Blindness&quot;.  Listening to these in this order under the right circumstances could change a life, rekindle a forgotten passion, or simply reduce the listener to a sobbing heap.  They are THAT powerful.<br />  The range of feeling captured in Bono's wailing vocals on &quot;One&quot; is absolutely incredible, especially in the surreal crys that end the song.  &quot;Acrobat&quot; dabbles in electronic influences and uses thick sonic brushstrokes to paint a cavernous musical environment that is completely encompassing (and this is before Bono even utters a syllable).  The album ends with one of the most bittersweetly-beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard in &quot;Love is Blindness&quot;.  From the almost gothically-eerie organ intro to the penetrating echoes of Adam Clayton's bassline, the song literally stabs at your soul.  And the lyrics are poetic - for example: &quot;Love is clockworks, and cold steel, fingers too numb too feel...squeeze the handle, blow out the candle, love is blindness.&quot;  Words simply can't describe how perfectly this song captures the agony of loss.  You have to hear it for yourself...and that goes for this entire album.  Easily U2's best, if not the best of the entire 1990's.
B00003CWPR|1.0|I can't believe this was Kubrick!The visual style is true Kubrick, but this is a garbage piece of film from the mastermind that gave us Dr. Strangeglove, 2001, Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket(ALL OF THESE FILMS ARE 5 STAR!!!) DO NOT WASTER YOU'RE TIME ON THIS GARBAGE!!Rent the other Kubrick gems I have mentioned instead!!!
B000056K04|3.0|Unfortunately, I have to agree with the general analysis, replete with the deep sighs and head shaking with which all DaveHeads will meet this new album.  With each new album release since Under the Table, I have held my breath, thinking they couldn't possibly outdo themselves, but they did, each time taking us to new heights and new realms with that enigmatic mix of jazz, rock, blues, something like country Celtic, and Dave's own special sauce.  But if you're looking for the original Dave, forego Everyday.  The album is sans sauce, sans all that we've come to know and love in DMB.  The six tracks in the middle are almost impossible to differentiate from one another; they all sound so much the same.  The emotional highs and lows and blood thrumming thrill of the past has been replaced by a 2/4 humdrum beat that reeks of, well... pop music.  There are two somewhat redeeming songs on Everyday, What You Are and Mother Father, the only two in which you almost believe in Dave's sincerity, a characteristic of his that we once took for granted.  I have bought it in the hopes that it will &quot;grow on me,&quot; but I am dubious.  My fingers are crossed that Dave has experimented once, and having inhaled, didn't much like it.  Dave's muse has left the building.  Let's hope he has the sense to run after her.
078322804X|5.0|This is a gem. This is one of the few musicals(besides the Marx Brothers) that I will watch. It is, however, more than just a musical. This is a film that has everything. There is comedy, music, classic Belushi, and one of the most elaborate car chases ever filmed.This is one that ranks right up there with Stripes, Caddyshack, Meatballs, and Animal House.Watch for Steven Spielberg cameo towards the end.(His only lines:&quot;May I help you?&quot; &quot;and here is you're receipt.&quot;)
0811826848|5.0|First of all, I am only 22 years old, and I am a huge Beatles fan, as is my mother still, since she saw them in concert in 1965 when she was 13. We frequently trade CD's and info with each other, and we are great fans. Her favorite was always George, and my favorites are Paul &amp; Ringo. I got this book for Christmas, and it is amazing. It reveals everything that you wanted to know of what was going on behind the scenes of the greatest rock and roll band EVER. No one will ever compare, and no one will ever come close to being what they were. I think it's great that they wrote this book, and it is a treat for any true Beatles fan like me and my mother. Any band that can span generations from parent to child is top rate in my book. If you are a true Beatlemaniac, get this book, you won't be able to put it down. A treat for all. I wish I could give it ten stars.
0385493622|2.0|I may have to apologize for not as raving as other reviewers on this book by Simon Singh. To be fair to the book and thus the author, I do find a fairly fluent narration on the mathematicians who attempted or contributed to solve the Fermat's Last Theorem. Meanwhile, I personally don't find the writing style and the organization of the materials to be particularly appealing.<br />We never hold any slightest hope that a 285-page book (the paperback edition) would offer us a clear understanding on how the proof, that incorporates so much of the techniques in the modern number theory, is devised.  The book basically steers itself all clear from the mathematics.<br />These below are what significantly push my rating of this book to a low range:<br />1. Too much on who the mathematicians were rather what they did to the proof.  Approximately two-thirds of the book is on stories behind those mathematicians who one way or the other got involved in the Last Theorem. Those may be interesting from a historical perspective but are simply irrelevant to how we came to the proof.<br />2. The author starts quite early in the book to tout mathematical proof as an \\"absolute proof\\" that \\"[m]athematical theorems rely on this logical process and once proven are true until the end of time.  Mathematical proofs are absolute.\\" By contrast, \\"... the scientific theory can never be proved to the same absolute level of a mathematical theorem ... So-called scientific proof relies on observation and perception.\\"  An account on the differences between the two is beyond the scope here.  Apparently, the author either doesn't know those are apples and oranges or, worse, attempts to elevate mathematical proof to an \\"absolute\\" level it might not need at all.<br />3. Throughout the book, the author has mentioned more than once how important logical proof is in a mathematical proof.  At least he cites the two events with the first in Wolfskehl's finding of \\"a gap in the logic\\" by Kummer then the secondin Katz's checking of Wiles' proof.  Unfortunately, the author allows such a gap of logic in the proof of Pythagoras's Theorem shown in Appendix I: \\"... four identical right-angled triangles are combined with one tilted square to build a large square.\\"  The author only states so but fails to provide any proof that the inside four-sided shape formed by the four hypotenuses IS a square.  (Certainly we do know it is and can plug the proof. Otherwise Pythagoras's Theorem won't hold.)
0789723107|5.0|I have my business online, and have researched and read a numerous amount of books dealing with online businesses, creating easy web pages, etc.  I have not found one decent, informative book written for non-technical people like me, who need to read things in plain English, until I came across DON'T MAKE ME THINK.  I can't tell you how much this book has helped me.  It's taught me everything about how to make web page usability WORK! It taught me how to understand the web from a &quot;users&quot; point of view. I now know how people really use and see the web. It took my hand, and guided me through the most &quot;common-sense&quot; approach to create and write web pages for every person to understand and use.  Most importantly, it taught me how to make the ultimately best web page and web site ever: Easy to use, Easy to navigate and Easy to understand. Krug's insight, knowledge, advice, suggestions and overall intelligence on this subject is that of a GENIUS!  My favorite quote and chapter in Steve Krug's book, is:  &quot;OMIT NEEDLESS WORDS.&quot; Did you know that you can cut out half of the words on your website without losing any value?  Neither did I.  This is an excellent source of information, that is a MUST HAVE for everyone in this business, whether you're a web designer, own a web based business, etc.  I have read Krug's book about 7 times so far, and it is the main object on my desk, besides the computer, scanner and printer.  The title speaks for itself.  &quot;DON'T MAKE ME THINK.&quot;  You should think, and make this book a &quot;staple&quot; in your home, office, pool, boat, car, garden, etc.  Without this book, my business would have never been able to survive, because I was able to understand what the problems were, and how to fix them so that they aren't hard to use.  The harder something is for me to use, I just don't use it.  Same goes for everyone else.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is the appex of Zep's career, at the height of their power before the long spiral downard as well as being  beset by personal tragedies including the loss of John Bonham. Every track is nearly solid, including the much maligned second side which includes Ten Years Gone, the best ballad Jimmy Page ever wrote.
B000056V73|5.0|When I was fifteen years old, I had a subscription to Rolling Stone magazine, and every notebook and backpack I owned bore the logo of Led Zeppelin and The Who.  Which is probably why \\"Almost Famous\\" didn't resonant completely with me the first time I saw it.  I wanted to fall in love with fictional band Stillwater just as I had Zep.  But I didn't.  On seeing the film a second time, it's not that surprising.  By the its own admission, Stillwater is an average band making good on charisma and hard work and a touch of luck.  But the music is merely a canvas.  The passions of the individuals involved are the paint that makes this movie a great piece of art.  The boys in the band are passionate about the music.  The groupies (excuse me, \\"Band-Aids\\") are passionate about the music, and the bands who make it.  The 15-year old rock journalist (and Cameron Crowe double) is passionate about the music and what it takes to write about it.  His mom is passionate about her beliefs and instilling them in her kids.  And everyone is passionate about finding something real to latch on to, to make them, in the end, \\"people of substance\\".<br />And director Crowe is passionate about telling this autobiographical tale with energy and sincerity and dignity, but also about keeping it true, exposing the warts and all.  He does so.  Magnificently.  It lives up its pedigree, being superbly written, honestly acted, and insightful to such a degree that it exposes bone.<br />\\"The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you're uncool,\\" says Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) at one point.  It is my favourite line in a script that, even though it lacks a \\"Show me the money\\" moment (\\"I am a golden god,\\" pales in comparison), speaks deeply on a lot of personal issues in a pristine and economical way.  A story that on first glance I found meandering and pointless, I appreciate now precisely because it is meandering and pointless.  We follow a rock bandon tour.  What could be more meandering and pointless than that?  On the other hand, when one sheds the veneer of cynicism that adulthood saddles us with, we have to realize that there is nothing more beautiful.  To the people living it, it is Bohemia and Valhalla rolled into one.  Beautiful life and beautiful death.  Crowe's script lets these weighty concepts hang in the air, available for the passionate viewer to latch on to, and come along for the ride.<br />The acting ensemble is led by four (and a half) wonderful performances.  Patrick Fugit, in his first major role, is asked to carry the bulk of the film's innocence.  And he does so with aplomb.  It is an assured and strong performance.  Kate Hudson deserves all the accolades she has received.  However, on my first viewing, I had a tough time appreciating her work, because I was busy falling in love with her.  But now I see that she gets things right most of the time, showing she is able to simultaneously play the spirited sprite and the broken old soul.  I also suspect that she must have given the cinematographer fits, because she seems to be composed solely of a warm, bright light.  She glows.  Frances McDormand, on the other hand, plays the dowdy and domineering mom.  The revelation here is that she manages to enliven her with an odd kind of cool.  I adore everything she does here (and in her other movies), and whatever capacity for crushes I had leftover after my run-in with Ms. Hudson, I gave wholeheartedly to Miss McDormand.  Billy Crudup, as Stillwater's mysterious guitarist, didn't have me convinced the first time around.  But on the second pass, I realize that his is the best performance in the movie.  There's a moment near the end that clinched this realization for me.  He realizes he's been duped, and shows his appreciation for the person who got the better of him with a sheepish grin.  It's the capper in a series of subtle suggestive glances that line his flawless performance.  (N.B. The \\"half\\" performance noted above belongs to Phil Hoffman, who, in what amounts to an extended cameo, proves once again that he is incapalbe of giving an unrealistic performance)<br />As for the film's insight, well, I'll leave that for you to discover.  Needless to say it will be more beautiful that way.  I know, I know, this all sounds like mindless hippie drivel, but when I encounter a Cameron Crowe film, I find it very easy to wear my heart on my sleeve.  With pride.  And passion.
B000056K04|5.0|All of you out there who didn't like this CD because you think Dave sold out or because the instruments are electric don't have a clue what good music is.  I read this review by some guy who thinks he knows that Dave Matthews and the rest of the band are trying to appeal to select age groups with this CD.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is for anyone who likes good music, because that is exactly what is on the CD.  This CD is great and is definitely a must have for any DMB fan.  I am a big Dave Matthews Band and I followed them around on their 2000 summer tour from Boston to Connecticut to the Carolinas and they were unbelievable.  If you like their other studio releases (Crash, Under The Table and Dreaming, Before These Crowded Streets) then you will love this one, GUARANTEED!  GET THIS CD!

6303014100|4.0|This is an excellent movie for anyone interested even remotely in history and is a must for Civil War buffs!  Although, it is a long movie, I feel that it is truly worth the viewing.<br />The first half of the movie seems to move more smoothly and quickly than the second half (which is why I only gave it four stars).  The main reason for this, I feel, is the superb acting by Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain and Sam Elliott as General Buford.  Both of their performances are truly masterful.  <br />The second half moves more slowly but is still worth watching. The battle scenes are extremely well done and I particularly appreciated the fact that the movie was actually filmed in and around Gettysburg and in the park itself.  <br />I felt that the weakest characterization was that of Robert E. Lee, for while Martin Sheen's acting performance was technically well done, I did not feel he captured the essence of Lee's personality.<br />Well worth watching more than once.
B00000IAU3|5.0|The first time i heard the first single Hear With Me, i fell in love. i knew i had to buy this wonderful c.d. I listened to all the songs right away and i loved them all. My favorite song off No Angel is All You Want. I love this song and i cant get enough of it! My Lover's Gone is another great song that makes everyone get a little misty eyed. I will STRONGLY  recommend making Dido's No Angel apart of your collection asap. Dont delay Buy Today!
B0000062GK|4.0|this cd isn't only joe's best,but its perfect.joe actually has improved,his playing every song,is great.every aspect of his playing is featured on this cd,and even better john cnuniberti's loud banging isn't there to ruine the artwork,like on not of this earth etc.....the sound of crystal planet is also(crystal clear) on this cd everything came together perfectly.i think satrianijohnson/vai,woke joe up on this cd he has relly surpassed his students.however,i can only give it 4 stars because the track i was most impressed with,TRUMBALIND wasn't joe at all but dweezil zappa.
B00003CXSP|5.0|This movie was great. Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore both did a fantastic job. I thought Julianne was a good replacement. I liked the gore (im wierd like that). Umm.. Oh this movie did not really scare me. A few times, it was a bit scary because It was one of those suprising scenes where something or someone pops out and freaks you out.       One thing I thought was unfortunate was a scene that they did not add that was from the book that would have been interesting. I would suggest you read the book before you see the movie because then you might get everything better. Overall though, I thought it was really good!
B0000029LG|5.0|Where do I begin.  First I'm not going to compare Michael's recording to Thriller or Bad, yet I can understand why some do.  History was not an album I intended on buying, in part because of the price.  But eventually that changed.   I had an opportunity to hear this fantastic double cd.  It really blew me away.  I still said that I couldn't see myself paying 32.99 for this album, even after being out for 6 years now.  But one listen to Stranger in Moscow, and Money, I knew I had to get it.  This album is just as good as anything Michael has put out.  Some may disagree because of his earlier achievements with Thriller.  Yet anyone who listens to Michael's music has to admit that even with the material that may not be groundbreaking, it is still a heck of alot better than what is being done today.  Lyrically his music is always strong, yet his message has changed.  While I don't want to make comparisons, I have to admit that the reason that I really liked History is because of the sound of Stranger in Moscow and Money.  Those two songs especially Money remind me of Off the wall days.  Primarily because of the chorus that he sings.   Its the way he sings it that reminds me so much of his early days.  But honestly the whole album is fantastic.  Michael has never put out anything that was bad.  Everything he touches is good if not great.  The only thing that I hope in the future for Michael is that he can put the anger behind him.  Although I must admit, it probably isn't easy, but after two albums(dangerous and history) I think we all can understand and feel the pain that the tabloids has brought to him.  We hear you loud and clear Michael.  <br />Unfortunately the media may never let up on Michael, in that case its time for him to move on beyond the media and continue to make great music and live his life.
B00003CX6P|1.0|I cannot express how horrible this movie was!  Not only do you have to stare at Matt Damon's face for over two hours, but it also burns in your mind as you are knodding off while watching this bore.  The movie was dragged out, with every cheap attempt to throw twists and turns that were completely not needed.  The only bright spot was the acting of Jude Law, who is absent in almost the whole last 1/4 of the movie.  Matt Damon and Gweneth Paltrow both over-act unbearingly.  If I wanted to torture my worst enemy, I would tie them up, and force them to watch this unbelievable trash!
0767020308|3.0|Although the A&amp;E version does develop the characters more than the Hollywood version with Gwenyth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam I don't think it's better.  My main problem with this version is the two main characters, Emma and Mr. Knightly.  They don't look &quot;right&quot; together and there doesn't seem to be any chemistry.  In fact, they don't even seem to like each other much at all.  <br />I think the Paltrow-Northam version shows much better a relationship between two people who care about each other and then fall in love.  This version makes it seem like two bickering psuedo-siblings suddenly decide they love each other.  It just never felt right to me.  <br />That said, I think the A&amp;E version is better at portraying every other character.  The Hollywood version made the other characters so extreme they were more laughable than realistic.
B000000WZ4|3.0|Ultra is not a bad album; in fact it does contain some good songs. But as a Depeche album is a bit weak; except for 2 songs, the rest are all ballads; most of them are ok, some are excellent (Sister of Night, Home), but they are too many for the same album; The sounds used in this work reveal Wilder's absence, as they are much too simple; I don't abhor guitars as many fans do, but some guitars are out of place, such as the country guitar on 'Freestate'. The album stmes fall in a lack of ideas which make it a good album, but not one of Depeche's best ones. What I've already listened from the new 'Exciter' album makes me hope for more diversion and inspiration. I think 'Ultra' lacked creativity; too many ballads, and the real hits weren't comparable to older hits such as 'Behind the Wheel' or 'Walking in my Shoes'; Best songs: 'Sister of Night', 'Home'; furthermore, there're some fillers, instrumental songs which add absolutely nothing relevant to the album and only make it longer and worse.
6305907145|5.0|From the moment this movie started I was in awe.  It was acted superbly.  The setting was amazing.  The story is timeless.  <br />The most amazing thing about this movie is that the director added Jane Austen's adolescent stories into the film!  The story about the woman who &quot;lived beyond her means and was imprisoned and partially eaten by her two young sons&quot; is my favorite!<br />This is a must see!
B00000DCHD|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums. Big Shot and My life are great hits but my favorites have to be Stiletto and Zanzibar. Dont waste another minute, buy this cd now!
6305291489|5.0|I'm an adult guy, just like one of the previous reviewer, and I love this movie. I have always liked Disney's magical films; it always brings out the child from me. And that's a wonderful feeling. <br />I also watched the original movie: what can I say? The 1998 version is light years ahead not for the more advanced computer technology, but the script is simply fantastic. I have read it several times. The acting is so much better that it's hard to describe. Lindsay Lohan is wonderful, enchanting, adorable. Dennis Quaid and the rest of the cast outshine everybody combined in the original release. <br />It is touching, uplifting. Every time I watch this film, soon I realize, or someone else in my family, that I have a smile on my face. I can't help it. Often it is very deeply emotional, touching our inner most souls, evoking tears in our eyes. The 1960 release never affected me this way, no matter how many times I have seen it. <br />All in all, I recomend this movie to everybody: young and old, who still can appreciate clean style, good dialogues, action, suspens. Even if the story is predictable, it is immensly enjoyable.<br />I also agree with one of the reviewer that Disney should release a special edition DVD with director commentary and behind the scene featurette. I'd love to see more of this kind of beautiful movies from Hollywood. I gave five stars to this but only because that was the highest. Ten thumbs up!!!

0140135154|4.0|I will begin this review by mentioning that I have not seen the television mini-series that WAYS OF SEEING is based on.  However, that did not appear to detract from the text in any way, as this was both a very interesting and a highly informative read.  The book covers a lot of territory from the mind to sex to capitalism.  It's unfortunate that the book is as short as it is, as not every section gets the detailed attention that it deserves.  This book would have greatly benefited from being at least a hundred pages longer and reproducing the pictures in colour.<br />However, for what the book does have to offer it is quite good.  The book is divided into seven sections, four of which are text and three of which are pictorial essays.  The essays are all focused upon the central theme, yet can be read separately.  Each section deals with its own topic and there is very little overlap.  John Berger does a very good job at describing the effect that images have upon the mind and the mood of the viewer.  A lot of care is taken to explain these passages clearly and the examples that he uses are very effective at demonstrating his case.
0767849493|1.0|I was very excited to see this movie.  I liked Clerks and Chasing Amy a lot.  I think people just like this movie because it is from this hip new director but if you took Kevin Smith's name off of the box I don't think this movie would have very many fans.  This movie didn't strike me as controversial or thought provoking.  It also wasn't funny or entertaining.  I was bored.  Kevin Smith's characters are constantly explaining the plot to you through the whole movie.  My english teacher always told me to show, not tell.  Apparantly Kevin Smith never learned this rule.  And on a side note, I know Chris Rock seems like a really funny guy, but is he ever funny in anything?
6302256704|5.0|I have to say this is probably my favorite comedy of all time. This HAS to be one of the funniest movies ever made. What truly amazes me about this movie, is that i've seen it over 100 times and every single time i find something NEW about it. there's always something happening in the background, that you might not notice at first, most of which are very subtle. This movie is a classic and i think everyone should watch it again and again. I love this movie far more than the sequel. I've never watched this movie without laughing. some of the most hilarious characters besides Admiral Benson, are \\"washout\\" and \\"deadmeat\\" !!!!  I love this movie ! One of the best movies ever made. get your dvd copy now.
0440416027|5.0|I just read this book in an afternoon. Not because it is short(it is fairly compact), but because it was so compelling. I couldn't put it down. Almond's imagery is breathtaking and his ability to take you into the moment with Michael and his not altogether acknowledged or undertood anxiety about his life, the recent move and the ill-health of his infant sister is instantly alluring and involved. Almond manages to beautifully capture moments in adolescence with a rare maturity that gives life to the characters and reminds us how children are more receptive and adaptive to change and the unknown than adults give them credit for. Wonderful, wonderful story. An instant favorite.
B00003CXP1|1.0|the Run Lola Run style montage sequences were cool, the Bugs Bunny schtick was effective, and Kronos did a nice job with the sound track.  but the Calvin Klien stylized drug melodrama central to the film was so amazingly bad it ruined the experience.<br />I hated this film so much I walked out of the theater after 45 minutes.  it was that bad.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|This CD is probably a best buy for those who want one CD with most of Lenny's hits on it. If you spend your money on all the other CDs, you might be disappointed to say the least. As a rule here, his other CDs contain only a couple of good songs per CD, and the rest is either boring or aweful. Typical rock album formula, you know what I mean. But this CD is good, because most of the songs are excellent, minus only two. Oh how I miss the good old days of the Beatles and Pink Floyd, when EVERY album was excellent, there were NO bad songs on the albums, and they were NOT attempting to mimick someone elses musical styles... BUT, as it is, I have to commend Lenny on his obvious talent and the many very enjoyable tunes he has created. It's still all surface clutter though really; fun to listen to, but it's not very deep at all. But that's how pop music is you know. Worth a few listens, but it eventually gets old...
6304493681|5.0|The animation and sound staff worked for reality in this show and it's been one of the best, if not the best, works to date.  The extra features of this DVD reveal more than you could ever find on the net of how this movie was made.<br />The artwork is very sharp even down to the bullet-hole details.  Above average special effects.  The 5.1 surround sound is awesome with a subwoofer.  Machine guns and the background music set it off nicely!<br />The story is of course, excellent.  If you're thinking about choosing VHS over DVD, think again.  There are plenty of improvements in sound and the extra features that make the DVD a better choice....END
B000056K04|2.0|If you have been following DMB for the The 'DMB sound' don't bother with 'Everyday'. The album lacks the honesty, detail, and the tight arrangements associated with their earlier albums. The overall sound is more electric ( thanx to Carlos Santanas contributions to the Album ) and lack the raw 'jammy' feel. The band has clearly departed from its endearing blend of  balanced instrument solos and intrusive vocals normally resulting in a tight sound. If not for Daves voice one would be hard pushed to recognize the band. This one belongs to the bottom of the CD rack......
B0000508U6|4.0|As I told my best friend while &quot;Parachutes&quot; was playing in the car tonight, this music makes me feel all contemplative and mysterious.  Perhaps not the most eloquent rendering, but it's honest.  Certainly this album will not change the world or even your outlook on life (unless you're really really malleable), but it's nice to have on hand when you just want to be mellow.  Bonus: it's great make-out music...
B00004X01U|4.0|This is Madonna's first release since her critically acclaimed &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;. The opening beats of &quot;Music&quot; lets you know that this is not the same CD. The song is very complex yet simple. It makes you want to move. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is an unusual song with voice distortions and crazy sounds, but I challenge you not to want to dance to this song. &quot;I Deserve It&quot; is a haunting song with its acoutsic guitar and strange siren. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is a great track. It starts off like its skipping then the acoustic guitar and beat kick in, and the song takes off! &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; is a beautiful song about the difficulties of being a woman in the world. This song is up there with her best. The final track &quot;Gone&quot; is very simple by featuring her strong vocals and an acoustic guitar. This CD has been accused of being shallow on the lyric side, but one listen to it, and you will see that some of the songs on this CD are her best written to date!

B00004X01U|4.0|This is Madonna's first release since her critically acclaimed &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;. The opening beats of &quot;Music&quot; lets you know that this is not the same CD. The song is very complex yet simple. It makes you want to move. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is an unusual song with voice distortions and crazy sounds, but I challenge you not to want to dance to this song. &quot;I Deserve It&quot; is a haunting song with its acoutsic guitar and strange siren. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is a great track. It starts off like its skipping then the acoustic guitar and beat kick in, and the song takes off! &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; is a beautiful song about the difficulties of being a woman in the world. This song is up there with her best. The final track &quot;Gone&quot; is very simple by featuring her strong vocals and an acoustic guitar. This CD has been accused of being shallow on the lyric side, but one listen to it, and you will see that some of the songs on this CD are her best written to date!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Ridley Scott silenced naysayers with his fantastic Roman Epic, Gladiator.  I absolutely love some of earlier Ridley Scott's films, and any Ridley Scott fan would absolutely love gladiator.  It is a very visually slick film, the cinemetography is top notch.  The look and feel is amazing.  The action is supurb. Part of the popularity of this movie has to deal with the amazing fight scenes that are portrayed in this movie.  Yes, the fight scenes are incredibly directed and are very intense.  <br />Even with all its technical prowess and action spectacles, Gladiator is not great because of this.  These aspects just greatly enhance what underlies it all: A fantastic story about a man and his longing for home.  The story and interaction between the characters is fantastic.  The general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator that defied an empire..... it is often an epic and ever engrossing film.   <br />My only complaint with the film (and keeping it from being a modern classic) is some problems with the script....  I would have liked to see more of the senate and the political dabblings of these corrupt individuals.  Oh well, can't ask too much. Gladiator should and deserves the oscar award. This is one of Ridley Scott's finest films.
B00003CX97|5.0|I have to say, I have just read a review of the film by Geoff Puterbaugh.  There is no word to describe it but insulting!  This film is the perfect example of the British 'stiff upper lip' and the integrity of one commanding officer who would risk his own life in order to save the lives and spirit of his battallion, even under the brutality of the Japanese high command in Burma.  The Geneva Convention didn't only ban officers from manual labour, it also dismissed any form of slave labour.  This film gives insight into the harshness of the Japanese labour camps and the force a Japanese commanding officer is willing to use on Allied soldiers to save his own endangered life.    This film is a stark reminder of the lengths a truly noble man will go to in order to save his men from becoming slaves to the Imperial forces.  Guinness was superbly cast, and truly deserved the Oscar he won. (MAGGY SAID HE'S SOUND)!<br /> This picture is a credit to anyone who served in the Allied forces in the Far East during WWII, and it is a credit to (the master) David Lean's brilliant filmography....<br />this film is a must buy.
B00000DFMM|4.0|I hate techno-pop, as a rule. I love this album, though. I bought it fifteen years ago and I still get the urge to put it on the turntable and give it a complete listen-through once in awhile. Too bad the b-side of the single of &quot;Duel&quot; isn't on the album. It's like &quot;Jewel&quot; only with the lyrics of &quot;Duel&quot; shouted in accompaniment. Oh, well, maybe they'll re-release this someday with that as a bonus track.
0195067142|5.0|&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; works on two very different levels.  One is an outstanding first-hand account of the campaigns for Peleliu and Okinawa from the perspective of the United States Marines.  The second, which is what makes this book so special, is the tale of the of fear and abject horror that those young Marines had to deal with.<br />&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; isn't just about two military campaigns in the Pacific, it's about the emotional &quot;campaign&quot; that each soldier had to fight just to keep going.  With an unflinching pen, Sledge takes the reader on a descent into the maelstrom of lead and blood that was these campaigns.  The reader feels the terror, the cold and heat, the filth, the sorrow...and is also offered a glimpse of the extraordinary courage those young men showed.<br />&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; is a superb, moving account of men in combat.  It is a must read for anyone who knows the operational history, but not the personal history, of WWII.
0517122707|5.0|John Kennedy Toole suffered and died from Bipolar disorder which is also called Manic Depressive Illness. His main character, Ignatius Reilly is the personification of the disorder of which the author suffers. Ignatius exhibits, in all his hilarity almost all of the symptoms of this dreaded disorder and the author even gives several cries for help through the Ignatius character. Ignatius exhibits constant agitation, fitful sleep, religious psychosis, punning and rhyhming, a constant pressure to keep on talking, severe grandiosity, critisim of others, a ridiculously dated worldview based on his grandiose ideas of how to turn the world in to a place of &quot;taste and decency&quot; through theology and geometry. Ignatius also, in his journals exhibits a type of writing through &quot;clang association&quot; that only people that suffer from mania can accomplish. The book is undoubtedly written so floridly,(another symptom of mania) that I will boldly state that if Toole was not manic, he could have not possibly written such a touching masterpiece.      Ignatius, cries for help, I think in the author's behalf. The words manic and depressed are used several times throughout the book. Ignatius cries,&quot;Is my paranoia getting totally out of hand!&quot; The Psyciatric Ward at Charity Hospital is mentioned several times. The description of Ignatius' dreams where he appears on a New York Subway platform as the re-incarnation of Saint James the Less and declares,&quot;Jesus will come to the fore, skins or not!&quot; certainly describes religious psychosis along with the aforementioned clang association.      Toole, during his short life, was an instructor at several Universities and Ignatius was even allowed to teach a course in the book although it ended in disater.      There are two version of Toole's end. One is that he committed suicide, a symptom of manic depression. In fact, most suicides are caused by people with untreated Bipolar illness. The other story is that they found him dead, long after the fact, in his car in a desolate backwater down south and that he possibly died of manic exhaustion.      As a sufferer of Manic Depression, &quot;Dunces&quot; is my Bible. All of my symtoms, including hypersexuality, are exhibited in Ignatius. Unfortunately Ignatius did not re-unite with his beloved Myrna until the very end and he had to resort, sadly to the mastabatory arts. So such a bittersweet book as a reflection of such a bittersweet illness, in all its florid hilarity cannot be missed. I have read this book a dozen times over the years and still find myself breaking out into horselaughter at some of the things stated by the beloved Ignatius Reilly.
B000002JSP|2.0|This one is the lowest rate of Zeppelin, I personally do not understand why this band was becoming huge in the States and Canada? To me, this band never made me a real fascination, though some their songs are nice too... I think Deep Purple is more quite nice and powerfull,...ok it is part of major taste! The early ZEP albums were much better, because their original style was more oriented in blues rock music, in fact Led Zep was not a typical pure Hard Rock band... This album is really a bit tedious!
6303430570|5.0|There is no denying it: &quot;Clerks&quot; is one of the funniest movies ever made, from the tiny snicker that escapes everyone's throat when Dante falls out of his closet to answer the phone to its very satisfying ending. It is almost nonstop funny, even when it decides to take little pitstops for moments of philosophy. It is very well acted, with more memorable quotes than a Shakespeare play, and it marks the beginning of one of the best and funniest comic directors ever to march onto a film set. Kevin Smith is a comic genius, sharply drawing all of his characters and giving each of them just the right edge for the actors to play on. Each character is an interesting individual, they aren't just play-offs of each other. Dante and Randal could've just been like any ordinary Abbott and Costello clones, and Jay and Silent Bob could've been exact duplicates of Cheech and Chong, but that would've been taking the easy/cliched way out. Smith is much smarter than that, and it shows in his hilarious and, at times, brilliant dialogue.<br />The plot of the film is fairly easy to explain. Dante and Randal are employees of the Quick Stop Convenience Store and RST Video Store. Dante gets called in on his day off because one of his co-workers falls ill, and because of Dante's hockey game at 2, the boss promises to be in the store to take over at noon. Dante accepts the deal and goes into work only to find gum jammed in the locks (&quot;Buncha savages in this town&quot;) to the steel shutters, the Asbury Press didn't arrive that morning, and in order to not lose business, he uses shoe polish to make a sign that he masking tapes to the side of the store that proudly proclaims, &quot;I ASSURE YOU WE'RE OPEN!&quot; That's just the first fifteen minutes of his day. Randal shows up late after an unruly costumer talks a mob into throwing cigarettes at Dante, and one costumer attempts to belittle Dante's existence but forgets something rather important to him (&quot;No time for love, Dr. Jones&quot;). This is a quite a start for a day off, but it only becomes more complicated when we find out about Dante having a girlfriend named Veronica who was a lot more busy in high school than he thought (&quot;THIRTY-SEVEN!&quot;), and he still carries a torch for the girl he dated for five years who cheated on him 8 1/2 times and is allegedly engaged to an Asian design major. WOW! Then we have the brief interludes of a pornoholic old man, a short-lived hockey game, and a funeral for &quot;one of the illustrious twelve&quot; women Dante has been with. All of this goes on while Jay and Silent Bob are dealing drugs and singing Russian metal songs, and &quot;Clerks&quot; never gets confused, it never steps off the point, and it never stops being funny. This is a monumental achievement for a director to make such extraordinary entertainment on his first try. As an aspiring filmmaker and video store clerk, myself, my hat is off to Kevin Smith, and I can't wait for the lightsaber fight between Jay, Silent Bob, and Mark Hamill. But until then, we have four great movies from this director who snuck in under the radar six years ago and delivered one of the truly great comedy films of all time.Jones&quot;).

0783228457|5.0|A cult favorite since its release in '83, VIDEODROME is in some ways a &quot;great flawed film.&quot;  The characters are far from sympathetic, the plot is often confusing and contradictory, and some of the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious.  Yet on the level of images and ideas, VIDEODROME is a rich, compelling experience which will take root in your brain long after the film is over.  James Woods turns in a terrific performance as Max Renn, sleazoid co-owner of a quickie TV station.  For reasons which never become clear, Renn is chosen as the gateway for public transmission of the &quot;Videodrome&quot; TV signal, which hypnotizes its viewers and causes mind-altering hallucinations.  Renn, always on the lookout for the ultimate trash with which to hook his slavish, sensation-seeking audience, is introduced to &quot;Videodrome,&quot; a charming bit of snuff TV where men in masks torture women and a black man for no real reason at all, except for cheap thrills.  Renn, correctly assuming that sex and violence sell to the masses, tries to discover the human face behind Videodrome.  Along the way, he stumbles onto what seems to be a conspiracy to control the mind of the North American audience through TV (hmmm...hasn't this happened by now?), seemingly to create an audience of docile, consumeristic sheep.  After a rather shocking sequence of events, Renn becomes one of the &quot;New Flesh,&quot; apparently a race of humans who have evolved away from the body to exist entirely in the electronic realm (hmmm...isn't this happening right now?) and are trying to destroy Videodrome.  His companion in this journey is masochistic Nicki Brand, played by Deborah Harry at her most glamorous.  Nicki, turned onto Videodrome by Max, abandons her life as a &quot;radio personality&quot; and seems to become an entirely image-based being, first used by Videodrome to seduce Max, then somehow escaping and joining the &quot;New Flesh.&quot;  I know none of this makes much sense, but VIDEODROME has to be seen to be believed.  Cronenberg's imagery, realized by FX genius Rick Baker, is incredibly sensual and powerful, using all the resources of the cinema to suggest multiple levels of reality and hallucination.  I won't spoil the surprises for you by describing the effects here; let's just say that Cronenberg combines sex, violence, electronics and body/machine anxieties in a new and compelling way.  Harry's incredible charisma and style lend the role of Nicki just the right touch of simultaneous allure and wierdness (she is first introduced as an image on a TV screen, and actually spends most of her time in the film in scenes where she is clearly a hyperreal hallucination instead of a person.  She and Woods have a very believable chemistry and should have had more scenes together - the script for this film needed a few more drafts.  I first saw this movie as a teen-ager, back before the Internet, virtual reality or cybersex existed, and developments in audio-visual technologies since then have only underscored the seriousness and ambition of Cronenberg's vision.  Where do we end and our electronic prostheses begin?  Is electronic experience more real than real?  Is the television screen now truly &quot;the retina of the mind's eye?&quot;  I think so.  VIDEODROME will make you think of your own environment in a new way.  Great late-night viewing!
6305095566|5.0|Ever since its release back in 1979, Sam Raimi's &quot;ferciously original horror film (Stephen King)&quot; has stood in a class all its own simply because no movie has ever been able to truly succeed it. The film's only true superior is its immediate sequel &quot;Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn,&quot; but most of us already knew that, so we won't count that one in the grand scheme of things.<br />When &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; was released, it was so totally gory, repulsive, funny, and scary that people couldn't decide whether this was visionary-ahead-of-its-time-filmmaking or a total waste of brain cells. The more intelligent among us recognize it as art in a genre during which time was just being rebirthed, thanks to the success of John Carpenter's masterful &quot;Halloween,&quot; which paved the way for pretty much every horror film that came after it. But Raimi didn't do what most of the filmmakers of the eighties tried to do, which was to basically copy the &quot;Halloween&quot; formula down on paper and make a new script with it. No, he had something much darker in mind; something that dwelt within the woods and could be reawakened by the incantations of an ancient book: Nocturum de Morto - The Book of the Dead, later renamed Necronomicon Ex Mortis, which was later abused by producer Brian Yuzna for the awful H.P. Lovecraft film called &quot;Necronomicon.&quot; The book, which served as a passage way to the evil worlds of the beyond was translated and studied by Professor Raymond Knowby, who used a tape recorder to record the phonetic pronounciations of the book's passages, not fully knowing exactly what he was doing with it. The professor ended up dead (we assume) after his wife attempted to kill him while possessed. But the professor reveals one vital clue as to how to destroy the demons in human form: Bodily dismemberment. Do we actually see this? Yes we do, and it actually looks realistic enough to churn a stomach or two. Yet, despite all of this seriousness, the acting of the film is so purposely bad that we realize that we're seeing more than a horror film: This is a satire. &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; was not made in bad taste, as its more hateful critics hypothesized, but on the contrast, it is about bad taste, and about making fun of bad taste in a new way. Not only do we see evidence of this in the bodily dismemberment of one inhabitant of the cursed cabin, but in the &quot;raping&quot; of another, the stabbing in the ankle of yet another, and the decapitation of the same &quot;yet another.&quot; This movie is so full of Karo syrup and latex it would've been easy for it to get lost along the way, but Sam Raimi keeps the film along the same track the entire time, lighting the path with lanterns of dark humor, and it never steps wrong. At its center is a sympathetic Bruce Campbell performance, amazing camerawork for such a low budget, and enough gore for an entire room of blood-and-guts hounds.

B000002IJO|5.0|&quot;Dance&quot; and &quot;Body Talk&quot; were the two big hits here but, as with most hard core fans, you need to dig deeper to find the REAL gems. &quot;One Good Lover&quot; and &quot;7th Avenue&quot; possess two of the best Demartini solos I've ever heard. &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot; is a great driving tune. &quot;Slip of the Lip&quot; is a heavy slow groove. But listening to these tunes out of the context of the CD is not the same. It is best to listen to this CD straight through to really appreciate it, but I guess that could be said for any Ratt CD. As a complete package, this Ratt album wins hands down.
B00004U2A2|5.0|I busted out laughing so many times during &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot; that I was surprised to be scared at certain parts. If the Three Stooges decided to put on hockey masks and make a horror film, this would've been the movie they made. Sam Raimi's spectacular sequel to the infinitely popular cult series that was spawned by his visionary &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (originally titled &quot;Book of the Dead,&quot; but the producers thought that a literary reference in the title would send prospective viewers astray) is so endlessly funny, violent and action-packed with uncanny sound effects and manic cinematography from Peter Deming (who worked with Wes Craven on &quot;Screams 2 and 3&quot;). It's a never-ending exercise in dark humor and all-out original thinking, and right at its center, a marvelously ordinary hero, Ashley J. Williams, played with amazing physical comic talent by Bruce Campbell, who is apparently the master of flipping himself over.<br />The film starts off as a sort of recap of the events that left Ash alone in the woods during the first &quot;Evil Dead,&quot; with some different adaptations (his other friends in the original were never there, only his girlfriend Linda). Then we're launched headfirst into this hair-raising carnival ride that takes plunges into all-out comedy and then rockets us back up into loops of hellacious scares. The very first brand new scene of the movie is something of a masterpiece as the Evil being in the woods sweeps Ash off his feet and carries him through the treetops. I didn't know whether to think &quot;cool&quot; or start laughing so hard I'd puke, so I did both (didn't puke, though). The new characters are introduced, some are turned into demons, some aren't. All of them reach a grisly demise either at the hands of the demonic forces of the woods, or by the ax of Ash himself, who is always in imminent danger of converting into a member of the Evil Dead fan club himself. As is the usual of films of the horror genre back in the eighties, the acting can be laughably bad at times. Bruce isn't exactly impressive, but he has his moments of believability, and he wears them proudly. But bad acting or not, &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot; is one of the best times a horror film has ever given me. I attribute this to a terrific comic performance from Campbell, the experimental camerawork from Peter Deming, and the kinetic direction from Sam Raimi. This is a movie that will be offering a good time to generations of dedicated film buffs in the years to come.k in the eighties, the acting can be laughably bad at times.

B000001FSR|3.0|Franks Wild Years is a good album, but I'm really surprised to hear people citing it as their favorite Tom Waits album.<br />Waits' 70's melding of jazz, folk, and beat poetry influences into something unique and genius is one of the best things that's ever happened to the music world.  Even better, mainstream radio overlooked him, sparing us the overkill that has made a lot of people sick of some of their former favorites from the 60's and 70's. Like a lot of Waits fans, I much prefer his barrage of incredible albums before the Rain Dogs / Swordfish Trombones / FWY trilogy.  I haven't heard Trombones, but although both Rain Dogs and FWY would qualify as many artists' &quot;masterpiece&quot;, in light of his previous work, they're simultaneously good and disappointing.  FWY has great lyrics, as all Tom Waits albums do.  It gets points for originality, too, but after a while accordians, pump organ, and optigon can get old.  If you're looking for somewhere to start with Tom Waits, try any of his 70's albums, and I'm sure you'll eventually want all of them.  If you wanna go with the 80's sound, I think Rain Dogs would be a better call.  <br />Of course, everyone has their own taste and judging from the reviews already posted, I'm in the minority on this one.  Don't get me wrong, I like FWY.  But of the 9 Waits albums I have, it's definitely my least favorite, and I'd guess that there are a lot of other people out there who have a similar opinion but haven't taken the time to send in a review.
006019250X|5.0|<BR>I checked this book out from the library, but I'm going to buy a copy and re-read it at regular intervals.<BR><BR> I read it over the course of one day, thought &quot;nice fable&quot; &amp; began reading another book as soon as I finished this one.  But I found that the lessons contained in this simple story of a shepherd boy seeking treasure, won't be dismissed so easily.  They must have taken up residence in my subconscious and kicked up some dust, because my mind keeps returning to the lessons of the story to find new and more subtle insights having formed. <BR><BR> These are lessons that we all know in our hearts, but that we forget as we get wrapped up in the hustle and bustle of our material lives.  Lessons about listening to our hearts and following our dreams. Lessons about living in the moment, the transient nature of possessions and the illusion that we can even &quot;possess&quot; something to begin with.  Lessons about freeing ourselves from fear and about understanding our lives as part of the energy of the Universe and understanding that everything will work out the way it was intended to. Lessons about trusting in signs, knowing that our lives have a grand purpose and that the forces of the Universe will conspire to help us fulfill that purpose. And the lesson that all of the fortunes and misfortunes we encounter in life are part of our spiritual education, and that it's not the earthly &quot;treasure&quot; we seek that's important but the lessons learned while in pursuit of it.<BR><BR> If you like to ponder the meaning of life, then let your mind and spirit mull over the lessons in this book.  It's a quick and enjoyable read that will provide some new insights, or remind you of some old one's that you've forgotten.<BR><BR>

B00000634J|5.0|If, like me, you're not the biggest Lennon fan in the world - yet you still thoroughly enjoy a lot of his records - then this is for you! &quot;Whatching the wheels&quot;, &quot;Woman&quot;, &quot;Imagine&quot;, &quot;Mind Games&quot;, &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Power to the People&quot; - all total classics. I've never been too keen on &quot;Mother&quot; or &quot;Happy Xmas (war is over)&quot;, but I find it hard for any music lover not to like this record. &quot;Working class Hero&quot; is FANTASTIC - although not to be played when your grandmother comes round for Sunday dinner!!<br />THE best track though is &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; - probably one of my favourite solo Beatles songs ever.. It amazes me when people harp on about &quot;Imagine&quot; (the song) all the time and fail to realise that off &quot;Imagine&quot; (the album) - &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; was by far the best track! <br />Great music - great compilation.
B0000508U6|2.0|Oh joy, another bunch of blokes holding guitars, with a lead singer who sounds like a lot of other lead singers, who also holds the odd acoustic guitar when he sings in his swooping falsetto. Coldplay come to us at an interesting time. Their single, Yellow, is a lovely little ditty sung by the singer while he walks across a rain drenched beach, imploring the females of the species to &quot;look at the stars.&quot; Because if you looked at the actual singer, you'd only see acne. <br />Coldplay are all in their early twenties, and by all means, they can write a heartfelt song. Lovely, lovely songs, including Spies and Trouble, which really are gorgeous, and I'm not just saying that to prove I'm giving a fair review. They are genuinely nice. But oh... where's the bit where you punch the air? Where's the bit where you turn up the stereo and tell your girlfriend to &quot;listen to this guitar bit...&quot;? Where's the snap? Where's the kickin' squealin' Gucci little piggy? This album, as testified to by countless critics, has a very warm feeling permeating beneath its skin. It's just that sometimes you want the warmth to turn to heat, and explode...like a watermelon going splat in the microwave, or perhaps Muse, or the Manics. I'm not even going to mention Radiohead. Sorry. I just did.<br />But it's trueeee. Chris Martin has Thom Yorke's high pitched angel-voice, but Martin's voice doesn't change mood or tone nearly as much as Yorke's. Nor are his lyrics anywhere near or approaching Yorke's. Where Radiohead go &quot;Couldn't look you in the eye...&quot; Coldplay go: &quot;For you I'd bleed myself dry.&quot; The lyric fom 'Creep' is dead set honest. Who can properly look beauty in the eye and not feel inadequete? But compare that realism to the notion of bleeding oneself dry. What's the point of that? It's a metaphor, obviously... for undying devotion. But how real is that? Of course, he's not going to slit his wrists for the girl his lyric is directed at, nor will he love her forever. He's just trying to get laid. It's just a huge, open statement that you can't answer back or think about too much. But my oh my, isn't it just beautiful?<br />Where's the edge? Where's the X Factor? Coldplay sell a lot of records. But only because Yellow and Shiver, the two best songs on the album, are great singles. The whole album has no peaks, no crescendo, no part where you feel the tingling in your spine. I've listened to it plenty of times, and everytime I've come near that feeling, I've brushed it aside because the way it's induced is wholly unoriginal, heard-it-all-before, soft, plaintive and embarrassingly boring. Coldplay's music has bleakness, understatement and a chronic lack of colour or flair. They seem to think that a few minor keys and the odd phased guitar will impress. Umm, no, sorry. All I hear is grey. Oh, and yellow. But that's all.<br />Go back to high school and take some drugs, for God's sake.
B000002ULO|4.0|Everyone on the planet went crazy about this album on its release - they hailed it Pauls best solo work EVER. But maybe that opinion was clouded by the euphoria of the Beatles anthology... and a NEED for everyone to connect once more with an old musical friend.. Maybe? Maybe not...?!<br />This album is still top class though - the only poor track being &quot;Really love you&quot; which has Ringo on drums; as does the climatic ballad &quot;Beautiful Night&quot;. &quot;Somedays&quot; is a return to the old Beatles ballads that Paul used to churn out at alarming regularity - and it's really comfortable.. Almost like the return of an old pair of shoes that you thought had been stolen!<br />&quot;Calico Skies&quot; is a favourite cause it's clearly written for Linda and the words are excellent and touching.. Infact most of the songs on this record are acoustic - &quot;Little Willow&quot;, &quot;Great Day&quot;, &quot;Heaven on Sunday&quot;, etc.. I like them all, but none of them really STUN me - none are absolute classics; although &quot;Young Boy&quot; and &quot;Souvenir&quot; come close....<br />I believe that &quot;Off the Ground&quot; was slightly better than this one - that was a real 90's rock album which stirred your imagination and provided TONS of melody. However &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; is a well written, relaxing semi-acoustic little gem - if you're a Paul fan you have to buy it... It's almost like &quot;Unplugged 2&quot;!<br />The words are the best quality with &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;; because they're clearly written with the sad demise of Linda in mind..
B0000027G6|5.0|I have loved this album since seeing the movie's original release.  The music is moving.  The entirely instrumental album can invoke emotion and make your stereo sound great with the tremendous fullness of sounds presented.  This is a must buy!
B000056N8X|5.0|I will review 2 things, first the DVD itself, then the movie.<br />1. the DVD<br />Well. If you (or the publishers) want to know why someone from Germany (a.k.a. me) pays nearly 15$ more for a region 1 DVD, this one shows you why: Its packed nad crammed with goodies and stuff and it has a complete second movie in it that shows how a cut can alter the movie (i cannot tell you which one i prefer, really). Sound and picture are top notch. So this goes to the companies: Until we do not get the same here in region 2 countries, you won't stop us from buying region 1 DVDs. Really, i would love not having to spend so much money on shipping (money that i rather would spend on another DVD!). But since you seem to believe that its ok to treat i.e. Germany second class its _your_ problem. Safe your money for easy-crackable encodings, just give us the same DVDs: problems solved. ;)<br />2. The movie<br />Everybody should know by now that the first movie has no sequel and ends with its credits (Connor has the prize). So Endgame is not a sequel to the first movie. Engame is the movie-sequel of the tv Highlander-series which took the idea of the Highlander-universe into the nineties: So there is the same myth that there are immortal people killing each other following rules and rituals and not even they know why they exist and how this all works. The main character is Duncan McLeod and only him Then there are very strong supporting characters like Methos and Joe Dawson - and of course Connor - but since this is kind of another parallel universe the prize has not been handed out yet since in the series you can see lot of people &quot;becoming&quot; immortal and thus equaling the number of dead ones (here is the main difference: The movie speaks of the final gathering - the last immortals meet in New York and fight it out). During the series the overall ambience grows very dark, sad and tragic (and follows the desillusionated mood that was attempted to put on Connor in the first movie). I really loved this and the main reason i liked Endgame is, that this darkness remains in the movie - and gives it a great disturbing undertone that helps the movie to clearly differ from the first movies mood: Far from the heroism of the eighties the immortals are troubled with fear, sorrow and self-pity. The &quot;Game&quot; is no more challenge for the good of the world but an unnerving fateful curse to the most of the immortals with wich they just try to cope (and survive as long as possible). The story is allright, you could see it as a tv double-feature with higher budget. The historical parts are, as in the first movie, the best, i think they are the reason for the success of Highlander in the first place. Funny sidenote: I have no clue, what additional 12 minutes there should be in de DVD: Perhaps we had this version in the movies here in Germany (Like with the first movie - the directors cut was the normal movie version over here)? Or did they cut the bedroom-scene in the US (i heard that a naked breast can be a big problem over there)?
0451457994|5.0|I'm 21 and haven't seen the movie. Yeah yeah, I know, I know. Am I the only one? So I've heard all this hype about the movie, and I always see the book at local bookstores, so one day I just picked it up.<br />This is an awesome book. It reminds me of Carl Sagan's &quot;Contact&quot; in a way. Actually, it reminds me of so many other science-fiction books...which is probably because so much of our outer space culture is based off of the ideas in this book.<br />This book is a classic. It really is. It talks about issues that Man probably thought of a while ago, but never had the technology to actually think of doing it. Like cloning...the book mentions cloning organs, so people with heart/lung/tissue damage can live. Then it goes further, saying: Is that all we can do to help ourselves live? What about bionic skin? What about instead of putting one artificial organ into us, why not put one of our organs into something artificial -- like our brain into a machine? Then we'd live (or our thoughts would live -- what else are we?) for a much longer time.<br />But this is just one of the MANY concepts the books goes into. I can't say enough about this book, except that I can't believe I still haven't seen the movie yet. I doubt, even though all I've ever heard was wonderful things, that the movie can even halfway compare with the book.<br />*reminds himself to add Clarke to the new favorite author list.*
B000059TPN|5.0|If your a fan of The Rock then this is the ultimate DVD collection to own.  I own the original DVD release as well and that version just can't compare!  The lack of true 16x9 enchancements really show through. The Criterion version contains a complete digital transfered widescreen enchanced for 16x9 edition!  The quality is outstanding, really looking 100% better in 16x9 mode on a WEGA tv.<br />The new version also includes a DTS soundtrack (also has DD 5.1) something that was missed in the original release.  I feel DTS is superior to DD 5.1 and when I always purchase the DTS versions for my collection. There is also a 2nd DVD full of extras including outtakes, documentaries, interviews, storyboards, and more.  There is also audio commentary by Bay, Bruckheimer, Cage and Ed Harris on the first DVD.<br />If your a fan of The Rock or other movies by Michael Bay/Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer you owe it to yourself to pick this version up!
B00000I8BX|5.0|This CD deserves more than 5 stars. It is just mindlessly heavy and even more seamlessly put together than Demanufacture. It is another concept album with a distinct storyline. In it, machines have taken over the earth, and mankind has become &quot;Obsolete&quot;, a useless organic waste of space. Humankind has started an underground rebellion, and it comes to a head with the escape of &quot;The Edgecrusher&quot; a criminal.<br />Like I said, it is very heavy and catchy. Burton C. Bell seamlessly switches his vocals from screams to melodic singing in a heartbeat, and the instuments are very well played. I especially love the way they go from hard and relentlessly heavy, as in Shock, Edgecrusher, and Securitron, to more melodic, emotional songs, such a Descent, Timelessness, and the extraordinary Ressurrection.<br />This is a great buy for any fan of Industrial or Metal Music. These guys are one of the most consistently good groups in a long time. Even though they constantly evolve, they still keep their core great qualities.
B00005AR3G|5.0|Of course the kids loved it, but so did the adults.  I took one of my good friends on a date to see this movie.  Both being almost 18 years old, I felt like I'd fall asleep during a Disney movie.  But I didn't.  I loved it.  I started laughing from the very beginning.  The Emporer, played by David Spade, is just great.  Spade uses that sarcasim that is well-known from his SNL days, and Tommy Boy.  Even the dim-witted body guard was great.  He had me laughing all the time.  Getting beyond the sentimental value of that night, this is a really good movie, and that is why I gave it the 5 star.
B000000H5J|5.0|In their earlier works, Fear Factory seemed a little lost, unsure of where they belonged in the world of music. In this CD, they found their niche, killer guitars, growling vocals, and seamlessly blended samples.<br />This CD is a concept album, based loosely on the story of a rebel who is raging against the government. He becomes a hunted criminal and finally matures enough to deal with authority.<br />This is overall a great Industrail/Metal album, heavier than a ton of bricks. It has so many good tracks, its hard to pick a top five, but definitely New Breed, Pisschrist, Flashpoint, H-K (Hunter-Killer), and Self Bias Resistor are my favorites. The bonus tracks are also very good. They use these to explore different sides of music than the ones that they use in the album. The remixes, espcially the New Breed mix, are also very good and worthy of honorable mention.<br />Overall, a breakthrough album that set a standard for the rest of Fear Factory's work.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I HAD MY PS2 FOR 2 WEEKS NOW AND ITS WORTH THE MONEY I ONLY HAVE 2 GAMES BUT ILL GET MORE SOMETIMES I DONT EVEN WONNA GO TO WORK   AND THE DVD PLAYER IS GREAT THE PICTURE AND SOUND IF YOU HAVE A SONY SURROUND SYSTEM WILL KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR FEET TRUST ME I SOLD MY 5 DISC DVD PLAYER BECAUSE THE DVD ON THE PS2 HAS FUNCTIONS A REGULAR PLAYER DOSENT LIKE DNR/DVD VOLUME/AND MORE SO  IF DONT FEED INTO THE RUMORS IT PLAYS ALL DVD MOVIES ANDPS1/2  GAMES AND ITS WORTH THE MONEY.

B000022TSF|5.0|One of the greatest film mysteries of all time is CHINATOWN, and this DVD finally presents a video version worthy of the film. In sparkling clear and colorful film noir, we see Robert Towne's masterful story acted by a stupendous cast of performers, none of whom has ever been better.<br />No need to go into the specifics of the mystery. Ace detective Jake Gittes is on the trail of a murdered water commissioner whose wife has her own series of mysteries she's covering. In true mystery-fashion, the plot is labyrinthine on first viewing, but it all flows together beautifully once the resolution is presented and one has a chance to review all the twists and turns.<br />The DVD features the movie's first anamorphic widescreen presentation, and it's a joy to behold. Seriously saturated colors and a sharp picture make the previous laserdisc incarnation (up until the DVD release the only widescreen version available) insupportable. Sound is clear and balanced with a newly mixed Dolby Digital 5.1 track replacing the original mono of the laserdisc. All the better to hear Jerry Goldsmith's mournfully brilliant score.<br />Lovers of mysteries won't need my recommendation to snap up a copy of this one pronto!
0679879269|5.0|Well, this book is almost perfect. I personally think that there should be another book, after all Pullman is still alive. Why didn't he continue? I mean, I'd love to know what happens to the daemons and about if they actually meet again and about this Republic of Heaven. I'd also like to know if Will and Lyra grow up and meet each other again, not knowing who is who and then reveal their past figuring out that this is Will and Lyra! I wonder if they will marry...This book was a little confusing, I hated the Mulefa part, too boring. The saddest part was when Lyra had to split up with her daemon, I almost cried my heart out. Note: I'm not the real Lyra!! I just love this series so much, I had to use the name Lyra Silvertongue! Oh, yeah, and I think the second book was a lot better. My main question is, &quot;Why couldn't Pullman continue, like J.K. Rowling did?!?!&quot;
B000002J1F|5.0|Needless to say this is one of the best prog rocks albums aver released. I will not insist on that. I want particularly to remark the astonishingly Squire performance along the four strings in every track. Just pay attention to its amazing tempo and clearness. Please, you Yes fans, next time you listen to this album, put yours ears on The Fish and mainly on Long Distance Runaround . Youll discover heart and soul of a bass player. Enjoy it!
0553573403|4.0|This book is unrelenting.  And that is both its strongest point as well as its biggest drawback.  The writing is very powerful, the characters finely drawn, and the historical context and background quite complex and a nice parallel to the War of the Roses.  However, this book will hit you like a sledgehammer. It is depressing.  Very little &quot;good&quot; happens, which of course, is largely what makes it interesting.  I had to take a break from it halfway through, because, frankly, I just needed a little breather from all of the doom, double-crossing, and anticipated deaths by battle.  Moreover, as you get further into the book and start to figure out where some of the storylines are going (and start to figure out who is not going to make it much further in the series) you will also be a little disheartened.  Again, in large part this is why this book is interesting.  Martin is seemingly unparalleled at gradually revealing his characters' thoughts, political mistakes, and wrong assumptions in a way that makes you wince when you suddenly realize what repercussions will ensue from the characters' frailties.  Martin has mastered the art of letting you in on the secrets without actually revealing them outright.  Most of the secrets though lead down the path to gloom and doom. And while I haven't yet read the following two books in this series, I suspect there will be more of the same and I look forward to it.  This is indeed something different than the usual fantasy pot-boiler in which it is presumed that good will win out over evil with a minimum of tension, muss and fuss.<br />Martin has crafted an original and heartless universe and storyline that has definitely lived up to its billing.  This is for the thinking fantasy reader (sometimes I wonder how many of us are really out there).  While you are reading this book, just remember to step outside every so often to clear your head and blow away some of the bleakness that will rub off on you.
B000056K04|5.0|For all of you who say &quot;this is not the Dave Matthews I had grown to love&quot;...get some depth.  Sure the 'classic' Dave is great, but album after album started to sound the same...Jazzy and easily liked. A year ago they ALMOST released an album similar to every one in the past, but they scrapped it. Dave...well done, my friend. He wasn't afraid to venture out and rock out with a few Sunny Day Real Estate-ish vibes (&quot;What You Are&quot;) and some beautiful, beautiful rock. I'm glad they released this... hopefully the 'white-baseball hat wearing Jocks' will turn off from Matthews and let the real fans tune in. Bravo. The drumming is incredible as usual, and Dave sings magnificently... the middle section of &quot;Dreams Of Our fathers&quot; gives me chills, similar to those I got from Radiohead when I first heard &quot;Let Down&quot; from OK Computer. I almost didn't buy this in fear of just another &quot;Dave Album&quot;, but I'm relieved that I did. What an amazing record..and especially for writing the material in 10 days. Little Ants...march home now, so Dave can see his real fans clearly.
0767811070|5.0|This is one of about 5 movies that can bring me to tears.  This is the first movie I ever saw Cuba Gooding Jr. in, and his performance was spectacular.  Everything else I watch him in is judged against this movie.  Some of Singleton's imagery is a bit over the top and cliche, but all in all, he captures the experience of his characters near perfectly.   The movie felt real.  All the characters had real concerns, real problems, and reacted in very legit ways.  It didn't glorify gangs or violence, quite the contrary in fact.  The movie isn't about gang life, it's about three kids' life and their coming of age amidst tragedy.     See this movie, and then I hope you realize that all this Columbine and suburb school shootings isn't anything new.  This has been going on for quite sometime in neighborhoods you don't hear much about.
B000002BUY|5.0|SCIENCE is a work of genius. It's definitely more playful and experimental than Make Yourself, and it tends to veer off the funk sound they had down pat with Fungus Amongus and Enjoy Incubus. Since Im what you'd call a new Incubus fan, after listening to the laidback Make Yourself, and the funny-light hearted moments in FA, this sci-fi sounding album was a change of pace. This is true music-when you buy it, you don't listen to it, you revel in its brilliance. Here's a track by track review:<br />Redefine-This is a good song, but I think Vitamin would've made a better opener. It doesn't have a steady beat, and the vocals are sort of funky, but you'll learn to adjust. I love it when they go KAPOW! Vitamin-This is ripped from a sci-fi film, I tell ya. I could just picture &quot;Im born-Im alive&quot; being whispered as the title credits of a badass sci-fi film scrolled. It's so good, and it's addictive chorus rules. New Skin-Perhaps the biggest hit on the CD, it's too basic to be their best. I love the lyrics, and the sample in the middle is pretty weird. The beat is too rough, but the chorus is great. Idiot Box-I love how it starts off, really funky, then it goes into a fullout rock song with Brandon going, &quot;kapow!&quot; (he seems to do that a lot) Then it settles back into a funky melody. The lyrics are almost jazz-like, and his lyrics on TV are pretty cool. (at first I thought I'd hate it because he doesn't like the greatest invention ever made-but the lyrics are surprisingly clever) I love the middle of the song, how it gets funky again, then switches back into a rock song.  Glass-When I first went through the CD, it was my favorite track. It's easy to see why. It's guitar riff and drum beat is infectious-and the sample that keeps going &quot;Why?&quot; is cool. The lyrics are the most easiest to remember, as I found myself humming the beat and lyrics at school. The chorus is totally different, but the lyrics are just as infectious as the music.  Magic Medicine-The drum beat is obviously not the work of Jose, and although it has some cool moments, it good for maybe a listen or two. It's not as good as &quot;Battlestar&quot; or even the song at the end of the SCIENCE. (however, I like it when the sample goes: &quot;isnt that hippo fat?&quot;) A Certain Shade of Green-This is easily the BEST song on here, miles ahead anything on FA and EI, and better than some of the tracks on MY. The guitar riff is similar to &quot;Glass&quot;, so is the drum beat, but it doesn't repeat as much as &quot;Glass&quot;, and it changes a lot. The verse-chorus switch-off is good, and the lyrics rock. The middle of the song is the best, when Brandon says &quot;Green/What are you waiting for?/A written invitation?&quot; it gets really funky, then switches back to its infectious beat it has down so great. I love this song. Favorite Things-Probably my least favorite real song on here, at least FT has its moments. The guitars and effects during the verse are really cool, and the chorus is cool, with the drums going full speed. Summer Romance-Although the lyrics in the booklet don't really suggest anything x-rated, Brandon's, uh, panting vocals, and it's hollowed sound make it sound so porno-ish. The chorus gets really Ben Folds Five-ish, it's easily the best part of the song. It's a good song, but really, you gotta wonder what they were thinking when they wrote it. Nebula-This is my second favorite song. It starts with an incoherent sample, then the drums kick in full speed, like in &quot;Nowhere Fast.&quot; Then, just when you think it couldn't get any faster-Brandon starts yelling, and then the guitars and drums rock full blast. The beat calms down a bit, but Brandon sings his heart, singing about an Orgasmatron(!). Then it slows down, giving it a very epic feel. Then, similar to the beginning, the drums go full speed, but Brandon sings slowly. It all rocks so much, it sounds so cool. Then it rocks full blast, and some guy talks about &quot;such as found in...nebula&quot;. Is that Brandon laughing in the middle of the track? It sounds so evil. Deep Inside-This is the funkiest track on SCIENCE, sounding like a polished FA track. Brandon even sings with the accent that is used most in FA. It sounds really laid back, then it gets to the chorus where it rocks so hard. Then it slows down a bit. Although not my favorite track, it's so cool because I love the funky parts. (and when they go-&quot;where the f*** are we?)  Calgone-I love this song so much. It plays out like a movie. It starts out slow, with a story of a police car pulling over Brandon. It's about one bad day. Then, just like a movie, it picks up, and then Brandon goes on a full-blast rant about triple-A, and aliens. It's so funny when he goes, &quot;butt butt butt&quot;. Then it slows down, and the drums get really band-like. &quot;The day sucked the hardest ever&quot; are so funny. Then it sounds like your average rock song, when he sings the chorus. Then it's back to soiled sheets, and flying aboard a space ship. The drums get back in a band-like melody, and the chorus plays again. There's about four types of song in this one kickass five minute track. The lyrics are the funniest on here, and it climaxes so great. Then the band talks about almost erasing the song, which is funny at first, because it's such a stop in the aciton. A good song. Hidden track-It's ok, like MM, has weird samples.It sounds like a teacher or something. SCIENCE rules. BUY IT NOW!
B000000LZV|5.0|Unfortunately, when people talk about Double Nickels these days, they try and put it into some sort of Rock timeline. Like how it compares to God Save The Queen. Who cares. This is different. Don't compare this album to dinosaur rock. It is still completely relevant. <br />Truly one of the better albums ever made. So much going on. Listen to Jesus and Tequilla. You'll love it. You'll love it very much.
0618002251|5.0|The Lord of the Rings is a great Fantasy tale!  No other Fantasy story can even compare to compete with J.R.R Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings.  This story is about A Hobbit named Frodo, he bears a Magical ring that the Lord Sauron Desires above all mortal things.  With this &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; goes Aragorn, Gandalf, Merry, Pippin, Legolas, Gimli and Sam.  There Journey begins in the all to familiar land of the Shire.  Gandalf sets the stage for Frodo to take the ring into a Dreaded place on Middle-Earth called Mordor.  This is conciderded a Trilogy by some, but others it is a Novel of Great leangth, but whatever Tolkien intened it to be it turned out a Great book! If you havent read this book it is a must read for all ages.
0380788624|5.0|I unhesitatingly award this fabulous book 5 stars. The compelling story of game theory in WWII intertwined with the acitivies of modern day cryptologists is fascinating and has you turning the pages. Cryptonomicon, however, is much more than this. It stretches your mind, challenges your ideas, provokes your imagination and above all demonstrates the power of information. <br />The book can be read from several angles; on the personal level of the story of the Waterhouses and Shaftoes; as a book about the devastating atrocitites of the second world war, which gets across the horror of the war in the East; a demonstration of the calculating mentality of the power brokers responsible for the flow of gold and information aound the world and the unscrupulous uses which these can be put to; as a remarkable history of cryptology; I could go on! <br />The strands of this complicated web weave into one of the best books I have ever read. Anyone who enjoys this book is among the most discerning, tasteful and intelligent people on the planet. Anyone who doesn't like it - try harder. It's worth it.
B000056N8X|2.0|Being a faithful Highlander viewer i felt that this movie had no relavence to previous Highlander films. Being that Connor MacLeod is the one that recieves the prize in all previous  movies i found it ludacress that in Endgames he would die at the hands of Duncan Macleod an immortal with less experience.
0345404475|4.0|What an excellent example of the oft-stated principle that &quot;reading the book is better.&quot;  Blade Runner is a good movie, in my opinion, but Dick's story on which it was based is a lot more cerebral, offers many extras that would have been difficult to pull off in film, yet is no less entertaining.  There is a pervasive animal component to the story that is not fleshed out in the film, which is not only interesting but a neat commentary-slash-prediction on the possible future implications of Earth's growing list of endangered and extinct species.  Also, there is a much different dynamic to the Deckard- Rachael Rosen relationship than was presented in Blade Runner, and another, colder bounty hunter is introduced who causes Deckard to rethink his personal philosophy.  The descriptions of the futuristic setting were intriguing, yet not over the top (that was predictably better handled on film), and there are clever technologies presented such as mood organs and empathy boxes.<br />Do Androids Dream... has a fascinating story line and unique perspective that is a refreshing change from the more apocalyptic tones of science fiction.  Instead of trying to save the earth per se, Deckard is charged with keeping the peace, albeit in a sense not (yet) faced by today's law enforcement officers or vigilantes.  &quot;Retiring&quot; androids might seem to be amoral on the surface, yet the equation gets complicated the more human the androids are built.<br />The only aspect I wasn't crazy about was the presentation of the religion/philosophy of Mercerism.  I appreciated the commentary made by Dick about people's cultish devotion to a belief system, and the system's eventual expose, but I thought that aspect of the story needed more developing.  The Mercer passages were largely symbolic, and described in vague terms of imagery- a sharp contrast to the rest of the book's style.  [As an aside, the copy I had of this mixed up the words &quot;emphatic&quot; and &quot;empathic&quot; often, which was kind of an odd editing oversight, especially as the ability of humans to empathize was a central theme of the work.]&quot; often, which was kind of an odd editing oversight, especially as the ability of humans to empathize was a central theme of the work.]
B000000OF6|3.0|This slick, force-fed corporate-rock interpretation of the group's &quot;best&quot; perfectly illustrates Queen's maddening dichotomy: a 50/50 mix of superior,dynamic hard rock (&quot;Doin' Alright&quot;, &quot;Ogre Battle&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;--NONE of which appear on this collection) and smirking Top 40 embarrassments (&quot;Fat-Bottomed Girls&quot;, &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot;, &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;--ALL included here, unfortunately). This would have made more sense titled as &quot;Freddie Mercury's Greatest Hits&quot;, as it virtually ignores contributions by other band members (Roger Taylor's sporadic yet excellent contributions, for instance). Any track showcasing Brian May's brilliant and innovative guitar work also seems to have been an automatic disqualifier for inclusion here. To catch Queen at thier artistic, hard-rocking peak, pick up the first three albums as a more meaty alternative.
0783229364|4.0|I really was smitten with this comedy, and it is now marked as one of my all-time favorite films! Helen and Michael have really good chemistry together as Chrissy Wells and Brantly Foster(a.k.a. Carlton Whitfield)! First Michael is definately smitten by her when he first meets her at the water fountain, and then he grows fond of her more as they go out together! If I had to pick a favorite scene, it would be when they share their first kiss on the boat! True magic right there! It's too bad they didn't make a sequal to this, it would have been great to see the both of them again!
B00003XB8K|5.0|I have all the Enigma Cd's.  I think all of them are great but in this one the crew went a little farther.  They put in a little more beat and made more of the songs energetic.  Of course there is still the beutiful and relaxing touch in they're music.
B000056K04|5.0|After having read, listened too, and watched various DMB &quot;True Fans&quot; rip at this album, I reached the conclusion that any attempt by an artist to move beyond his norm would be seen as selling out. What exactly is selling out? Is it not the purpose of a disc sold on the open market, to sell? Yes, this disc is different than the bands previous offerings. Yes, the acoustic sound has been muted. However, almost all the songs are strong, with the exception of the Carlos Santana collabaration, &quot;Father&quot;.   This collection is by no means a marketing gimmick. The music still contains an irreverent sense of fun, of love, and of life. The sax is still used, but in sparse offerings, making it all the more poignant. The violins, as well, are in abeyance, yet when used still lift the listeners spirits. Many of the bands key elements remain, such as disjointed riffs, that seem pieced together, yet make a wonderful harmonic whole. The lyrics, which &quot;serious&quot; critics disdain, retain their quasi-political digs, thin veiled sexual innuendo, and above all the sense that this band is having fun playing together.   The first single &quot;I Did It&quot; is a fun romp, that is a great vehicle for Matthews non-traditional lyrical stylings, at times you can almost hear, and feel him smiling as he sings. &quot;When the world Ends&quot; is a very mellow, low key, summertime grove. The title track, &quot;Everyday&quot;, is, in my opinion, the discs best. Jazzed up, fun, and full of verve, it is what music should be: Mood lifting, merry making, dance inspiring, pure melodious joy.  The Band has branched out, not sold out. If you are looking for a disc with vast replay appeal, then do not be dissauded by the self proclaimed &quot;real&quot; DMB fans, who with rancor not unlike a toddler with a wet diaper, complain of changes. If that toddler had a voice he would tell those supposed &quot;Die hard, with them from the beginning, remember them from their club days&quot;fans to relax, because changes are sometimes very good, as this one is.
B000003TA4|5.0|This CD is just amazing. If you have not gotten it yet, order it RIGHT NOW. it just makes me go wow whenever i hear it. the music is amazing. Nirvana is a great band, and this is definetly a GREAT CD.
0783211856|5.0|Simply said this is probably the best motion picture made to date. At least in my humble opinion. While driving away from the theater, after the first time I saw it, I began to cry uncontrollably. No movie has ever challenged me in this way or brought me to such heights and depths. It should be required viewing for every High School student in the world. Those who pass on this movie because of it's dark side (including my wife) will miss out on a true human story. It will be painful, but in the end it will make you both stronger and enriched. Enough said.
0783243499|1.0|This was quite possibly one of the most horrifying and disgusting movies that I have ever seen in my life.  I know that many people loved not only this film, but also Christian Bale's portrayal of the coolly sadistic Wall Street killer Patrick Bateman. I have to say that I am not one of those people.  (There are many other movies that accurately show Bale's fine physique and acting skills besides this one!)  While Bale was certainly able to get into the role of Bateman, and in my opinion gave an accurate picture of this man's terrible thoughts, actions and egoism, I was still greatly offended by this movie.  While I do not consider myself a prude, this movie beat anything that I have ever seen.  I thought the scenes in which Bale's character brutalizes women after forcing them to perform various lewd and embarrassing sex acts on both him and each other were horrifying and degrading.  The movie just seemed like one long, neverending ride whose only purpose was to display Bateman's control over handfuls of helpless women through violent sex and murder. While I won't ruin the plot for those of you who wish to see the movie, I will say that there was one scene which made me almost lose it.  It was one in which Bateman brutalizes a woman while a frightened prostitute he has hired is forced to watch. When the prostitute tries to escape from his apartment, he runs after her and cuts her in half with a chainsaw.  This scene was made particularly outrageous by the fact that Bale's character is completely naked while he is murdering this woman.  Many people in the audience thought this scene was one of the funniest parts of the movie, but I felt that it was shocking and offensive. While I am not easily frightened and believe I have a good sense of humor, this movie disturbed me so deeply and was not funny to me at all.  It gave me a nightmarish feeling that lingered for hours after I saw it.  I do not know how anyone could even have felt this movie was worthy to be classifiedas a &quot;black comedy&quot;.  I felt that even the humor that the Bateman character used in everyday society was patronizing, rude and offensive.   The movie also contained scenes of animal abuse and showed the murders of several defenseless people, including a homeless man and an elderly woman.  All of this terrible violence made me sick, and if you are faint of heart or are squeamish in general, I would not recommend this movie at all.  &quot;American Psycho&quot; may be considered by some to be director Mary Harron's crowning achievement, since it covers the challenging territory of a killer's mind - or, some argue, simply the sick fantasies of an &quot;ordinary&quot; man.  Whatever the case may be, I feel that this movie is one of the worst examples of filmmaking that I have seen in years. For me, a movie about torture and murder is not entertainment.  I am not trying to take the high moral ground, but as a young woman &quot;American Psycho&quot; was grossly offensive to my sensibilities. To me, it displayed women as objects that were simply used and discarded by Bale's character, either for meaningless sex (as in several scenes) or for torture and murder, as in others.   I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and that my views are not similar to many of the reviews written on this website.  However, I would encourage anyone interested in seeing this movie to rent it before buying it, and then decide if they would like to add it to their video collection.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Firstly, don't expect it to be like Dookie because it is nothing like it. Yet, I like the way that Green Day have matured over the past 3 years. Since everyone else is marking it song by song I may aswell copy : 1. Warning : You all know this one. If not it RULES! 2. Blood, sex and booze : This takes some listening to for you to like it ALOT but at a first listen it is OK. 3. Church on Sunday : Just magnicent.Period. 4. Fashion Victim : Hmmm not sure. 5. Castaway : A ok! 6. Misery : Very VERY weird. 7. Deadbeat Holiday : Feel good laughing kinda song. 8. Hold on : not that good. 9. Jackass : The lyrics make me laugh . it is good. 10. Waiting : This is one of those songs which make you feel all gooey inside. Lovely. 11. Minority: Fabulous. 12. Macy's Day Parade: Another gooey yet depressing song.Good in its own creepy way. 13.86: OK. Not FAB but OK.<br /> Anyway, just buy the damn record.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles are the greatest artists of all time. And what better way to show this by taking all of their number one hits and cramming them into one great CD! All of the 27 tracks are classic songs that no one should be without. The Beatles' best, all on one CD. Who could ask for more? (I know I can't.) So if you're thinking of buying this album, DO NOT HESITATE! It's worth the price. It's a must-have for every music collection.
B0000508U6|4.0|I really like this album , I think it is something that you listen to after a hard days work to chill out a bit. After the seventh song you may lose interest because from here all the songs aren't very fetching. However, I suggest that you buy it since it is extremely good from songs 1 to 7 and you will enjoy mellowing out to it. Just don't expect a dance around your room or a head-banging affair.
6300274195|5.0|Aside from Dumbo being a classic Disney movie, it carries one of the better messages that we find in Disney's movies.  Many of these ratings are saying that Dumbo is inappropriate for children.  I can understand saying that 2 year olds may be disturbed by some of the darker images, but this message is a message that children really do need to grasp at a fairly young age.  We see Dumbo totally shunned by his own kind because of a slight difference of his.  At first he doesn't understand what is going on, but he grows to shy away from the other elephants and he even suspects that all laughing is directed towards him.  Children can be cruel to one another, even at a surprisingly early age.  Dumbo is giving the children an insight to how such hurtful comments can truly effect a person.  Giving a child a glimpse at what is wrong and what is right is the most we can hope for out of a movie, and Dumbo delivers, in full force.
6304806434|5.0|Great Movie! Great Action! Great Characters! This movie tickled us pink! We love everyone!
0767824571|5.0|I think that &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; is one of the best comedy movies ever.  The characters are awesome and it's a very enjoyable movie.  Now, there are those that don't find Python comedy funny, but if you do, this movie will tickle you silly.  Ahh - it's wonderful - I never get tired of it!

B000056K04|5.0|I'm not one to listen to music with my brow furrowed as I run through a mental checklist of expectations I have for the album I'm listening to. I don't listen carefully to see if they repeat lyrics, nor do I count how many times they do. When I listen to music, I ask myself one thing, &quot;Do I enjoy listening to this song?&quot; And I judge the album based on how many tracks there are against how many of those tracks I enjoy. And I love every track on this album.<br />It all comes down to whether or not you enjoy the music. Everything else is inconsequential. For many fans of DMB, apparently, change is heresy and an album full of music that is nice to listen to is something bad. After more than 10 years of great music, I think I can find it in my heart to allow DMB a little latitude with the direction their music is going. And when I don't enjoy it, I won't listen to it.<br />This album has more songs like &quot;Crash Into Me&quot; than it has songs like &quot;Ants Marching&quot;. And therein lies the debate. In my opinion, it's all good.

080017948X|5.0|Great comedies are rare these days.  Not that there isn't always some good or cute stuff still getting released on a regular basis, but you don't often stumble onto a film that is consistently outrageous, and thought provoking at the same time (at least not since Preston Sturges).  This is great stuff, the best work from both Harold Ramis and Bill Murray.
B0000508U6|5.0|I really like their music and it's something really new and different for me! I found their cd as one of my reccommendations and thought i'd check it out and i really liked it. It's soothing music and i love the lyrics and the lead singers voice is really beautiful the way he can hit those high notes!i bought the cd mostly because it had the song &quot;Yellow&quot; on it, but i discovered that there are alot of other good songs on the disc. My favorite songs are &quot;Yellow&quot;,&quot;spies&quot;,and &quot;Sparks&quot;,and&quot;Shiver&quot;. they are all really great songs with a simialr style to the Dave Matthews band. they have a great vcalist and a really great guitar player! this is one of my favorite cds now. I highly reccommend it!

0780628551|2.0|I was really disappointed by this movie. I thought this was going to be somewhat of a sci-fi movie, but about the only action in the film occurs near the very end. I guess I shouldn't have been too disappointed; the title pretty much says it all.<br /><br />The film revolves around the astronaut's wife (played by Charlize Theron). I was so bored by the opening half of the movie, that I never learned the characters names, I didn't care anything about them. Her husband (played by Johnny Depp) is in an accident in space, but after a brief hospital visit he makes a full recovery. Nevertheless, his wife notices some subtle changes in his behavior. Things aren't exactly what they appear to be.<br /><br />This movie portrays itself as being a type of sci-fi movie (and it was labeled as such in the store I rented it), but it is really more of a thriller along the lines of WHAT LIES BENEATH (a far superior piece of cinematic magic). However, there isn't anything thrilling in this thriller.
B00000K2SC|2.0|According to the commercials and previews before this movie came out, it look real cool with a lot of action. But when I saw the movie finally it didn't have a lot of action as in the commercial. Not till the end is where there's action, but the battles don't last long enough in the movie and there isn't enough. The plot wasn't that interesting either.<br />The only thing I thought was cool was the special effects and action scenes. If you really like computer art, weird, and sci-fi movies, The Matrix is for you.
B00004XQ83|5.0|It is all so great,and it makes you want to tap your feet, Now I want the viedo. Is it available yet?

B000002JR8|5.0|Two years had passed since the release of this band's second major full length record, Vulgar Display of Power. A totally amazing, mindblowingly heavy cd is the only way to describe that release. So what does Pantera do? They create a cd that smashed all the feats the prior cd had done, something I didnt think possible.<br />Far Beyond Driven finds Phil Anselmo and Co. experimenting with their sound to some degree, i.e. the death metal intro to Slaughtered, the industrial tinge to Good Friends. Nevertheless, they manage to keep their own sound without ruining themselves or their music. Strength Beyond Strength is one of their heaviest songs to date, combining Dime's amazing guitar work with powerful drumming from his brother Vinnie Paul. Also noteworthy are 5 Minutes Alone, Im Broken, Hard Lines, and Use My Third Arm. The real force behind these songs are Phil's vocals and totally crazy lyrics, which are pure agression. Song topics continue to be very human as opposed to gore and murder from death metal lots at this time.<br />Easily the heaviest band unleashed unto the world. Buy this f**kin record!!!!
B0000508U6|5.0|This cd is perfection. Every single song is beautifully written and performed, and I can't seem to take it out of my cd player. I would reccomend this to EVERYONE!
B000055ZDT|1.0|If they could bottle this stuff, it would taste like bong water. A close friend of mine, who knows that I'm into early Celtic Frost, Venom, and Black Sabbath, gave me Dopethrone and said I'd LOVE it. He couldn't have been more wrong!<br />I hate giving bad reviews because I understand that for every album out there; there's a following of people who get alot of enjoyment out of whatever it is they're into. I respect the other reviewers of this CD for finding some quality in this music, my friend gives the same reasons why he finds it so groundbreaking, but I just can't agree.<br />It's like Electric Wizard, Orange Goblin, Goatsnake, and the rest of these stoner-metal bands got the idea that because Sabbath's &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; and &quot;The Wizard&quot; are such great songs, let's do more songs just like them, but have an ultra-raw sound via no production whatsoever. <br />IMO these bands are for people who keep a tray under their couch, and like to spend all of their free time in a coma.
6305263248|5.0|Intelligent well-crafted espionage adventure about several ex-cold-war operatives hired as mercenaries to steal a mysterious package for an unidentified terrorist faction.  The international cast is top-notch with Robert DeNiro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Sean Bean and Jonathan Pryce.  The story takes place in France and provides a nice departure from most action movies that are dominated by American locations.  <br />The mercenary team is DeNiro, Reno, Skarsgard and Bean, ex-military or government employees who have been assembled though secret contacts to acquire the package for an organization with ties to the IRA.  The job is dangerous in that they must take the item from an organized crime element.  They are successful, but in the midst of the ambush operation, Skarsguard as the ex-KGB agent, suddenly makes off with the prize.    Several double-dealing events unfold and DeNiro and Reno soon find themselves alone as the only trusting partners in the ordeal, and begin digging up old government contacts to find their betrayers.  It's high adventure with plenty of fireworks and car chases, particularly the chase in Paris that's a white-knuckle ride when the pursuit goes against traffic on one of the major expressways.  <br />An excellent action thriller that doesn't insult your intelligence.
B0000019HU|5.0|Too many people here seem to have missed the first and only important fact about spiderland--that it is astonishingly beautiful.  Forget words like &quot;seminal&quot; and &quot;revolutionary,&quot; for they are only verbal playthings which obscure the fact that when the bomb drops, most of us will be listening to this album.  This is the new classic--Mahler doesn't make me cry anymore, &quot;washer&quot; does. bombastic?  of course.  true and neccessary?  right.

0553573403|5.0|After searching through epic fantasy, I must say this is the one.  Totally unpredictable, real non-virtuous characters, sex and violence.  This has it all.  After getting partway through other &quot;famous&quot; fantasy epics (wheel of time, sword of truth come to mind) which left me thinking &quot;why do I keep reading this stuff???&quot;  this book provides the answer.  It is possible to write interesting, unpredictable, imaginable fantasy.<br />Thanks, Mr. Martin, I look forward to the rest of your series, and I hope at some point in my life to find other fantasy again that it this compelling.  (why is it sci-fi can so easily break the mold of storytelling and plot, but fantasy is always forumlaic: super-virtuous nobody becomes most powerful person in world fighting most evil entity imaginable???)<br />Let me know if anyone has the answer...
B000000OTU|4.0|Throughout their career, Aerosmith has been known for signing contracts with new labels before fulfilling the obligations of their old ones. As a result, they are constantly releasing greatest hits albums as well as live recordings. Here is yet another one. This covers all the singles from &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; through &quot;Get A Grip.&quot; Singles like &quot;Janie's got a Gun&quot; and &quot;Cryin&quot; are bound to require multiple plays if you haven't heard them already. The downside of this album though is the blandness of the two new tracks, &quot;Blind Man&quot; and &quot;Walk on Water.&quot; These uninspired tracks left fans in an oblivion after this release, wondering where the future of the band's songs would lie. Thankfully, they rebounded nicely with &quot;Nine Lives.&quot; However, if you are interested in the greatest moments during Aerosmith's rise to rock/pop kings, here is the release for you.
0385335482|5.0|I have never felt the need to review a book until now. I want to get ahold of Sophie Kinsella and beg her to write more. I found &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; to be absolutely hysterical. I found myself laughing aloud on the stairmaster at the gym and in a doctor's waiting room, oblivious to all the people around me. <br />I can relate to Becky's creative way of thinking so much, although I know when to stop spending before I get in trouble! I just thought she seemed like someone I would be friends with, so fun and carefree,yet sensitive and vulnerable. <br />I am recommending this book to all my girlfriends; it was one of the most entertaining novels I've read.
B0000029AL|4.0|If you're looking to begin your quest through the Aerosmith oeuvre, this may not be the best album for you. However, once you check out their mid-70s landmark recordings, you should make your way back to this record. No one can deny the greatness of &quot;Dream On&quot; or &quot;Mama Kin.&quot; There are also plenty of other great songs that show the band in a different light than all others that followed. Steven's voice sounded different plus Joe had yet to become an integral member of the songrwriting team. Because of that, this is a unique album that shows the roots of the band's sound.
630417893X|5.0|So says the stuffy, but tough, Professor Henry Higgins (Best Actor Oscar-winner Rex Harrison) as the tired, but enchanting, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) manages to speak proper English. Winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, MY FAIR LADY proves that there is still plenty of life in musicals. Created by British playwright George Bernard Shaw under the original title, &quot;Pygmalion,&quot; we look into the lives of a phonetics teacher as his quest of turning a Cockney flower girl into a beautiful woman of Edwardian England. Distributed by Warner Bros., produced by studio head Jack L. Warner, directed by &quot;woman's director&quot; George Cukor (Best Director), this film was a winner from the start! With a cast of British players including Stanley Holloway (Best Supporting Actor nominee) as Eliza's sneaky father Alfred P. Doolittle, Gladys Cooper (Best Supporting Actress nominee) as Higgins's snooty society mother Mrs. Higgins, Wilfrid Hyde-White as the kind Colonel Hugh Pickering, Mona Washbourne as the gentle Mrs. Pearce, Theodore Bikel as the bothersome Zoltan Karpathy, and the handsome Jeremy Brett as the lovelorn Freddy Eynsford-Hill. <br />The musical numbers are, of course, fantastic! From &quot;Wouldn't It Be Lovely&quot; to &quot;With A Little Bit O' Luck&quot; to &quot;Just You Wait&quot; to &quot;I Could've Danced All Night,&quot; you find yourself singing and dancing along with the characters. The numbers rival those of other Oscar-winning musicals such as AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, THE KING AND I, GIGI, and WEST SIDE STORY. Though, Hepburn was dubbed by &quot;Hollywood's favorite dubbed&quot; Marni Nixon (who also dubbed Deborah Kerr in THE KING AND I, Leslie Caron in GIGI, and Natalie Wood in WEST SIDE STORY) ,  you still feel the passion given by those being dubbed. The serene look on Hepburn's face when she sings &quot;I Could've Danced All Night,&quot; for instance, is a wonderful example of forgetting the dubber and concentrating on the person on screen, namely Hepburn. The other dubbed actor is Jeremy Brett (Freddy), dubbed by Bill Shirley. Whoever Bill Shirley is, he is wonderful (with a rippling Butterscotch voice to boot). Rumor had it that Audrey Hepburn was an excellent singer, though Jack Warner must not have had enough confidence in her to pull it off.<br />That is very much like the casting of Eliza herself. Played on Broadway by incomparable Julie Andrews (who won an Oscar that same year for MARY POPPINS, her revenge in a way), people were against Hepburn playing Eliza. According to Warner himself, he didn't want an unknown actress playing a film role. I think that was dumb on Warner's part, especially since Andrews won an Oscar and, of course, starring in next year's Best Picture winner THE SOUND OF MUSIC!  But, Hepburn did a great job -- though the accent was a bit shaky in the beginning.<br />In conclusion, with 13 nominations and 8 wins, MY FAIR LADY brought out a classical film that inspired and touched people everywhere. And don't forget the film's competition: Stanley Kubrick's DR STRANGLOVE, Walt Disney's MARY POPPINS, Michael Cacoyannis's ZORBA THE GREEK, and Peter Glenville's BECKET. A major boost for Warner Bros. sagging weight at the box office and a major stepping stone for the Hollywood musical!<br />Awards: BEST PICTURE (Jack L. Warner), BEST DIRECTOR (George Cukor), BEST ACTOR (Rex Harrison), BEST COLOR ART DIRECTION/SET DECORATION (Gene Allen, George James Hopkins, and Cecil Beaton) and BEST COLOR COSTUME DESIGN (Cecil Beaton, creating a first in film history by winning both categories in one night), BEST COLOR CINEMATOGRAPHY (Harry Stradling), BEST MUSICAL ADAPTATION (Andre Previn), and BEST SOUND (George R. Groves).
B000002UB3|4.0|Although Abbey Road may not be the best album, or the most popular as regards the masses, it represents a generation.  It was the end of an era, the Beatles would go their seperate ways, and music was forever to be changed.  The songs on this album, in my opinion, are a collective best for them; reflecting the Beatles musical maturity on the whole and as individuals.  &quot;Come Together&quot; is a great start for the album, possibly even an allusion to the fact the the Beatles had to cooperate and put their differences aside in order to finish.  The song's lyrics are a reflection of the psychedelia that was sweeping the sixties, they are fun and, although make no sense put together, make a truly memorable song.  Harrison shines with his songs, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; showing that the &quot;quiet one&quot; could vocalize his feelings as well as Lennon or McCartney.  Starr's &quot;Octopus' Garden&quot; although a catchy tune, is corny and reminiscent of a kid's song.  However, no Beatles fan, or anyone who enjoys rock n' roll, should be without this piece of rock n' roll nostalgia.

0789723107|5.0|&quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; is incredibly clear, concise, and helpful - as well as surprisingly enjoyable. Every web designer or developer should read it and take its message to heart. I'm a busy person working at an ebusiness solutions provider, and these are the kind of issues I tackle every day. I am reading three industry-related books and ten industry-related magazines on any given day, and I managed to make it through this one in lightning speed. Kudos to author and editors for creating such an easy-to-swallow dose of usability advice, and for adding excellent sprinkles on top in the form of good-natured humor throughout and a resource section at the end.<br />I highly recommend it to any web designer out there. Since the industry is still relatively new, many people who become web designers have no formal training - or if they do, their training is in graphic design (print) or technology. But essential to any web design arsenal is more than just a good design sensibility or a good programming ability - you have to understand usability issues. You have to know your audience, and make it very easy for them to interact with your site - ESPECIALLY if you want them to purchase something on your site. <br />This book clearly and thoughtfully outlines the topic of usability, and all of its contents should be taken into consideration by anyone creating a site to be used by the general public. <br />To the reviewer who's been working in GUI design for 8 years, of course you're already familiar with these topics. Please, write another book! There aren't enough out there for those of us who don't have the benefit of experience like yours.
0312263511|5.0|I loved this book!   I just happened to be at the Kennedy Space Center when Gene Cernan was signing his book back in '99, and I bought a copy right then and there!  <br />This is one heck of a plain-spoken, mince-no-words look at the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of an ordinary person who was thrust into a historically extraordinary role.  What's different about this one is that Astronaut Cernan speaks from the heart; recounting all the emotions he experienced during his space adventures and all the stages of preparation that led to them.<br />The book does well in covering all the aspects of the space program, and does it from an intimate, insider point of view.  Towards the end, the tenor of the book changes to a more philosophically-inclined one, as Cernan looks at his accomplishments (and shortcomings) from the perspective of an &quot;ordinary&quot; grandfather...   All in all, a strong booster for the space program - and for humanity's role in future exploration.  All true space aficionados will love this book!
0789723107|5.0|&quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; is incredibly clear, concise, and helpful - as well as surprisingly enjoyable. Every web designer or developer should read it and take its message to heart. I develop web sites at an e-business solutions provider, and these are the kind of issues I tackle every day. I am reading three industry-related books and ten industry-related magazines on any given day, and I managed to make it through this book in lightning speed. Kudos to author and editors for creating such an easy-to-swallow dose of usability advice, and for adding excellent sprinkles on top in the form of good-natured humor throughout and a resource section at the end.<br />Web design is a young field, and because of that, many people who design web sites today have no formal training in web or interface design. A background in print design or technology is a great start, but not sufficient when it comes to creating a usable web site. It is crucial to take usability into account when creating a site that you want people to interact with - ESPECIALLY when you want people to buy something from your site.<br />This book provides a terrific outline of usability issues, as well as a look into usability testing, in a very accessible and encouraging manner. Anyone involved in designing or developing web sites can benefit from it. Especially if you have never conducted a usability test and don't realize how average people (ie, non-web-savvies) interact with a web site - this book will open your eyes to some vital information which will help you create better, more usable sites.
B0000214F0|4.0|I don't know why anyone would buy the cut version of this film. The real reason to buy this film is to watch your friend's faces when you show them this and they see famous actors doing disgusting and vile things. The most famous and vile of these is Malcolm MacDowell's part in &quot;The Wedding Scene&quot;.  (I won't describe it, but lets just say he won't be doing any endorsements for Crisco any time soon.)<br />I have heard varying claims for the historical (or lack thereof) accuracy of this film. I am not certain just how close they could come to describe just how whacked Caligula really was. I don't think it could be done correctly without violating a huge number of taboos. How to do it and not have it turn into exploitation is the big problem.  This movie avoided all that by becoming exploitation.<br />As for the rest of the film...  There is some hardcore sex, most of it quite uninteresting.  There are big name actors that must have owed some big favors or caught doing something quite embarasing to show up in this film. (How on earth did they get John Gelguld in this film?) There are lavish sets that look far too polished for Rome.  (Almost like a Penthouse photo shoot.)<br />On a side note: The soundtrack is actually quite nice. Mostly classical. (With the exception of the &quot;feature song&quot;.)  There was a double album of the sound track produced. Not certain how many copies were produced. Why it was a double album, I am not certain.  It could have fit on one. The first disc has the &quot;featured song&quot; on each side. One normal and the other side is a disco version. (Which has to be heard to be believed.)   Worth getting if you have friends and/or acquantences that need to be scarred emotionally.
B000006NUW|5.0|Having not grown up during the time these songs were popular, and only hearing them sparingly on the radio, this collection is a great investment.  Although I was not familiar with all of these songs before purchase, I knew I would love them all, and that turned out to be true.  This collection is for the generations that grew up listening to this music, and for those generations that were not so lucky.
B000056K04|2.0|I got this cd, expecting another masterpiece. I mean, &quot;I Did It&quot; is at least a *fun* song. But when I listened to the cd instead of just &quot;I Did It&quot; on the radio, I was *very* disappointed. The most fun you get out of the cd is seeing how many rhymes you count that don't have ANYTHING to do with the song, but are just rhymes. It was sickening. Put down the electric guitar, Dave, it's just not your thing.
B000002KOQ|5.0|I thought this album was so great. My favorite songs on the album are The Arrangement and Woodstock, but I think the whole album is great. It's just one of those albums that you never get tired of, you can listen to it from start to finish. In my eyes, I see Joni Mitchell as a real poet and a great political speaker for the negative things in our world, and for that she needs to be recognized. Great album
B000050XEI|5.0|I have shopped amazon for many cd's now.  I always consider reviewing what I have or have bought but never bother.  I usually look to the worst reviews to be the most honest and picky (as I am).  In this case however, the reviews are off and so I write my first CD Review on amazon.<br />Enya I love and this CD I love as well.  It carries a slightly different style to her previous recordings. (all of which I own and love (except celts))  It is made up of Enya's wonderful voice and a very summer's day feel.  The bottom line is that this CD is great.<br />Don't listen to the other reviews, If you like Enya (or similar) and you pass this CD up...well, it'll be your loss.
6305907145|1.0|- It is understood that a screenwriter must be allowed some lattitude in adapting an author's work, in order to accomodate the necessary differences between film and the printed page.  However, it is to be hoped that the rendition of a great classic will bear some resemblance to the original.  For Patricia Rozema, it would appear that it was sufficient to borrow some of the names of Austen's characters, and very little else.  <br />Young student's hoping to utilize this film as an easy substitute for a book report will be quickly discovered, for Rozema has significantly altered the unfolding of events, and has omitted several important characters as well.<br />While Rozema's Miss Price is very appealing to modern tastes, she certainly does not suffer the painful shyness which pervades the very being of Austen's heroine, and thus we are denied the full impact of Fanny's eventual triumph. <br />Rozema has concocted her own version of the story which adds a social message about the evils of slavery.  What she has created is not without merit.  For those who have never read Austen, it makes for a very satisfying film, but Rozema should take full credit for it's authorship and thank Jane Austen only for her inspiration.<br />For those who wish to see something more closely in harmony with Austen's novel, the 1986 BBC version (currently available only in VHS) will prove far more satisfactory.  It is interesting that the more authentic version claims to be &quot;Based on the Novel by Jane Austen, Dramatized by Ken Taylor&quot; while the jacket of Rozema's DVD loudly proclaims that this is &quot;The Story Jane Austen Loved Best.&quot;  <br />Were this film to be judged solely on its own merit it should probably rate four stars, but for its pretense to claim Austen's authorship, I cannot give it more than one.
0800177177|4.0|The only thing needing a change in this movie is the title. The problem is you have purist that read the book and then slam the movie. I have seen over a thousand movies and guess what, not a one of them followed the book completely. I do agree it isn't wise to say you're doing a true portrayal of the original story and then not deliver. It is a romantic and sexy vampire movie, period. Most men and women will enjoy it. It is definitely not for the kids. Sure sometimes it is almost as funny as &quot;Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; with Keenu's almost excellent adventure in talking English, but I don't think it takes itself so seriously to be all that bad. Catch it if you haven't. Personally my wife and I are getting it on DVD. How many excellent vampire movies are really out there? Three maybe, and none of them are true to the book by Stoker.
B000002R48|4.0|This album is a must-buy for any avid Dream Theater fan that can appreciate complex music.  One of the biggest complaints that I hear about this album concerns the vocalist, Charlie Dominici, and while I personally prefer James LaBrie as the lead, Charlie is still a fair vocalist and sings rather well in 'The Killing Hand' and 'Afterlife'.  Also, the production admittedly is terrible, but if you can get past it the music itself is very much worth listening to.  'Fortune in Lies' is a fantastic opener with a great Petrucci guitar solo near the end.  'YTSE Jam' is my personal favorite; it is an extremely catchy instrumental that shows just how well in sync these guys can play at their best.  'The Killing Hand' is another classic song that is often underestimated.  The rest of the album is good as well, but these three songs are the highlights.  Hearing a young John Petrucci is very entertaining, and his riffs are a good indication of what is to come in future albums.  Mike Portnoy's drums are okay but not that prevalent.  John Myung's bass is great and is quite heavy during some songs.  Kevin Moore, my favorite Dream Theater keyboardist, is incredible on this album, not for playing anything very difficult, but for rather using his keys to create a progressive feel to each song.  Overall, a great album that I rate higher than Falling Into Infinity, and plus, it's always cool to look back and see how far the band has come.  A very good buy for patient listeners who aren't too quick to criticize.
0152023984|4.0|This is a wonderful children's story that is enjoyed by children and adults alike. It is the story of a little being that visited the author, while he was forced to land in the Sahara alone, due to mechanical failure.  He needed to repair the motor in the number of days his water supply would last. It is there that he is awakened by the voice of the Little Prince, who shares his history with him in the days that followed.<br />Antoine reveals to us bit by bit the story of the Little Prince, his home, his love, his travels, and what finally brings him to Earth, where he learns the greatest lesson of them all: the secret of what is really important in life. <br />This story brings us to a point of reflection where we ask ourselves if our daily labouring does not result in \\"chasing after the wind\\", as many of us come to realise too late. Also, it highlights the \\"folly\\" we put up with in our society, to keep it as is. Yet the Little Prince shows us aspects often forgotten and overlooked as we strive to survive in this world. Antoine treats us with a memorable story that should be read by children and adults who have forgotten the dynamics of what it is like to be a child.
0767802659|1.0|Let me start by saying that I am one of those folks who read (and loved) Heinlein's book, and believe that there should be truth in advertising. Other than the title and the names of the characters, any relation to the book is purely accidental.  I have read the reviews which praise this dreck as high satire and a dark look at a fascist future. The book, which this stole the title from, is a completely different story which deals with honor, civic responsibility, and maturity.  The best comparison I can make is that this reminds me of Woody Allen's &quot;What's Up Tiger Lily?&quot; when he took a Japanese spy movie and dubbed it in English with no connection to the original plot. Entertaining - but no one walked away feeling they had been given a high-tech bait and switch.
0553573403|5.0|I came across George RR Martin by browsing the Fiction Fantasy section of my favourite bookstore. Since the book received some good reviews, even by Raymond Feist, I decided to give it a try.<br />Was I surprised! After the first two chapters I was totally hooked. George writes with such compelling conviction and style that it was very hard to put the book down. He introduces us to a world that is imaginative, where the characters are richly described and developed that they almost seem tangible. It is in the characters many individual facets of development that I find myself astonished as to the extent that George is prepared to take them. He thus masterfully sets the scene for a haunting and intriguing saga that will stay with you long after you read the book.<br />A GAME OF THRONES introduces us to four main families: The Starks, the Baratheons, the Lannisters and the Targaryens. Even though these are the main ones, there are others as well weaved within the above families, and plenty of smaller independent families. These pave the way later for some great plots and sub-plots.<br />Lord Eddard Stark, the Warden of the north, is instructed to be the Hand of the King in the south. Since Lord Eddard is a man of honour, he finds himself torn between his friendship for the king and the treachery that is evident at court. He finds it difficult to choose in that the choices are not as simple as right or wrong, but rather it becomes a choice between the lesser of two evils. It is here that Eddard learns of the rumoured murder of his predecessor, the imminent danger to his family, and the vile secrets that threaten to destroy the kingdom.<br />I read with wonder as evil defeated the innocent, yet it was heartening to see the innocent grow strong in the midst of their defeat. The one drawback I found in this story was the introduction of too many characters. This, at times, made it difficult to follow the development of these characters.<br />A GAME OF THRONES is well written and the characters are memorable. George RR Martin has become one of my favourite authors in the Fiction Fantasy genre. I proudly display his work next to LORD OF THE RINGS and THE MAGICIAN. It is a masterpiece of epic proportions that sets a new standard in Fiction Fantasy writing. I look forward to more.ten and the characters are memorable.

6305524866|4.0|Finally a film that gets me to laugh out loud several times. It's witty, it's typical Hugh Grant, it's British, and it's sometimes unrealistically ridiculous. So I laugh. And you'll laugh.<br />Why the main character Charles (Hugh Grant) falls for the sensual nymphomaniac USAmerican Carrie (Andie Mac Dowell) remains a mystery, but at least they finally found a part for Andie Mac Dowell in which she makes SOME kind of sense.<br />A funny British film which you have to have seen.
B000056K04|5.0|It seems that a lot of people think that the album &quot;Everyday&quot; by The Dave Matthews Band is a pitiful attempt to &quot;sell out&quot; and to lure the wide eyed masses into the record stores. Well then i must pose this question: If you were one of the top 5 grossing concert acts for the last several years running...why would you do something drasticly different than you had ever done previously?.....certanly not to get more fans or more money...that would be insane...no! you would keep producing the exact same songs over and over again on 50,000 live albums (ala the Greatful Dead). <br />The reason the new album is different is because thats the way they wanted to put it out. The whole band is very different people than they were 10 years ago (who isint?) they wanted to head in a different direction and really could you respect them had they put out another album full of &quot;Dancing Nancies&quot; (which is a great song but) they have been there before, they might return there again one day but for now they gave us a tight funky new album and i for one am just glad that they had the courage to do so.if you want to listen to music that is a little more raw check out: devon (a folkstress whose bass player just happens to be Stefan!) and the fantastic soundtrack to &quot;oh brother where art thou?&quot; and then come back and give this album another try.  Standout tracks include &quot;Mother, Father&quot; and  &quot;If I Had It All&quot; there are still enough thinly disguised come on lines to make any sorority sister melt. and enough testosterone for all my the manliest frat brother.
B00000064G|4.0|yes, this is a sad and eerie record . i must admit that i prefer the first two nick drake albums, but this is a fine album in its own right. my favorite songs are things behind the sun and parasite. know is also excellent, a weird  little blues cut with ominous and powerful strumming by drake and  a few deceptively simple words. a majestic and rather creepy release from perhaps the greatest of the late 60's early 70s singer songwriters. and as always, his voice, arrangements and words are eerie,haunting ,and touching. highly recommended.
6302516919|5.0|I actually read the book first which made me expect more out of the movie, oh well. The movie, however, is still worth the 5 stars I've given it because John Carpenter directed the movie and it turned out excellent, the special effects are awesome, AND that the story itself is by Stephen King. Now anybody who has read the book knows what the movie is basically about, but for those who haven't ventured this way, let me elaborate. The key characters are Christine herself (keep in mind she's a car), Arnie Cunningham, who falls in love with Christine, and Dennis Guilder, who is a friend of Arnie but an enemy of Christine. Arnie falls in love with Christine and buys her from George LeBay (Roland LeBay in the book, George is the brother), who is an eccentric old man. Arnie fixes her up to almost brand new, but all the other characters (Dennis, Arnie's parents, Leah Cabot) have this disturbing sense that Christine is more than what she appears to be. Turns out they're right when Christine slowly changes Arnie's personality from nerd to suave psycho. There's more to tell, but I don't want to give the movie away! The special effects where Christine rebuilds herself after each bashing is astounding! I'm still trying to figure out HOW did they do that. After seeing this you might think about the car you have. There is a lot of explicit language so this wouldn't be for those who are under age. An excellent car movie, but don't read the book first!
B00000064F|5.0|i think this could be his best album- i think the best tracks on the first album might be better than the best ones here- but overall bryter layter is probably the better of the two. i defy anyone, and i mean anyone, in rock n' roll today to write something as perfect and as beautiful as, say, fly or at the chime of a city clock. drake's voice and guitar work, as well as the beautiful orchestrations of robert kirby and guest appearances by john cale and fairport convention members, among others make this a lush and truly incredible album, nearly every track is a classic. this timeless album is like all of drake's catalogue-essential. he just may be the best post dylan singer songwriter , and certainly until recently an underrated and unsung figure .

B000000QG8|5.0|The late Rory Gallagher's studio albums are solid, interesting and extremely expressive.  Rory came alive when he stood before a live audience.  Recorded at what could be argued to be the peak of his prowess, Irish Tour '74 captures what those of us privileged to have seen him live had raved about for decades.  The material presented, for the obvious reasons, only represents material from his first few solo albums.  Even so, the full range of styles he embraced are evident.  From traditionally flavored acoustic blues to in-your-face electric slide, he had it all. A Million Miles Away is probably the quintesential Gallagher song, this live rendition has the fire and pathos to convince the new listener that this is one serious guitarist/songwriter.  This is a must-own album for anyone born in the last fifty years and does not sound dated, even after almost three decades.  How many albums can that be said for?
B000004286|5.0|O.k. I'm not going to write a long review and pretend like I'm some professional &quot;on-line soundtrack review author&quot; or anything like that, all I can say is BEAUTIFUL MUSIC.  This is some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard.  Tracks 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, and 17 are just totally amazing.  I also love the Scot bagpipe music in 8 and 15.     This is in my opinion one of the best soundtracks ever made, and the music in it is so moving that it will make you feel it way deep in your soul.

I took my brother's copy of the cassette and it has since succumbed to being played endlessly. So very glad am I to see this disk once again available, I am buying it immediately. <br />But to the matter of the content of the album. Exceedingly clever lyrics. GREAT beats, social commentary and responsible messages.<br />Unlike anything else you have in your CD collection. Even subsequent De La Soul albums.<br />I say simply.... buy it Buy It BUY IT!<br />You will be thankful.
B00004XONN|5.0|well kids, not much left to say about this one after the 12050 other reviews. radiohead has created a whole new sound, a whole new universe with this one. its dark and alienated like OK Computer, but with a lot less guitars and simpler lyrics. its miles away from the bends, and certainly NOTHING like pablo honey. thom and the boys have for the most part sacked the alt-rock yesteryears and dipped into some electronica sounds, lush synths and strings, ambient noise, odd beats and a little free jazz too. a quick hose-down of the songs:  everything in its right place: wonderfully dark electric piano number, with some creepy synths, cut-up vocals and softly ticking drum machines. reaches a near orgasmic buildup during the &quot;tried to say&quot; part.  kid a: possibly the best song on the album, or in recent memory. i agree with the reviewer who said this song is like seeing the world through the eyes of an infant; weird images, indecipherable sounds, millions of colors. the vocals are almost liquid, bumpy synths, stop-and-go beats and a groovy bassline. total winner. the national anthem: amazing piece of music. freaked-out horns, throbbing, plodding bassline, alert drums, disturbing synth noises, and vocals that sound like they were recorded in a metal tank. the whole thing just gets more and more chaotic, then just kinda collapses on itself. makes you want to freak out and roll around on the floor, eyes bulging and tongue wagging. great stuff! how to disappear completely: finally, some guitars! blissfully depressing opus about being &quot;not here, this isn't happening&quot;. wounded, passionate vocals. reverb-drenched descending guitar line cutting through a mist of strings, brush drums and some interesting basswork. this is one of radiohead's dreamiest songs (almost as dreamy as subterranean homesick alien, now THAT'S dreamy!). treefingers: a few minutes of ambient drones. all guitars. nice &quot;intermission&quot; kinda piece.  optimistic: the lone &quot;rocker&quot;, dark, biting. the intro kinda gives you the feeling of being on a rolling ship deck during a rainstorm at sea. slithering guitars, great tom-pounding from phil. near-disturbing banshee vocals. a grating rock 'n roll outro segues into a brief hip-hop interlude. trippy! in limbo: this song is extremely hard to get into at first, definitely the most obscure track on the album. impossible to describe. an odd time signature, weird drumbeat, slightly distorted vocals. lazy, twisting, country-ish guitars wrapping around jazzy synths and who-knows-what else. love it! idioteque: interesting drum 'n bass experiment. cryptic lyrics about &quot;laughing till my head comes off&quot;, &quot;women and children first&quot; and &quot;swallowing till i burst&quot;. metallic beats, odd samples. you can dance to it! morning bell: a dreamier, poppier song about a ghost in thom's house. good drumming, more electric piano. motion picture soundtrack/hidden track: pure beauty. a simple organ accompanies thom's heartbreaking falsetto delivery, then blossoms into an ornate tapestry of harps, strings and synths. very pleasant, like floating up to heaven. after a few minutes of silence, the harps and other instruments make a brief return. a nice low-key close to an album that's all over the map. this album takes a few listens to get into, but man once you get into it you never wanna leave. wonderful soundscapes, and eye-popping booklet artwork. also look for their next album, amnesiac, coming june 5th. can't wait for that one!
B000000OF6|5.0|I was not alive when most of these songs were originally recorded, however, I am a huge fan of all genres of music, including classic rock. When I first heard this two disc set, I was enchanted by the melodies, the vocals, and the instrumentation. Such moving ballads as the little known, &quot;Save Me&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; are among my many favorites. You have the golden age of Queen in such hits as &quot;We Are The Champions&quot; and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, as well as their later fare such as &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; and &quot;Breakthru&quot;. It's all fresh, captivating, emotional, yet lighthearted, witty, brilliant, stirring...it's well...Queen!!!!
6302969352|5.0|A stunning, profound, magnificent masterpiece, surely one of the few greatest films ever made.  Based on a relatively simple plot -- a local village tired of being preyed upon by bandits hires seven samurai to protect them -- Akira Kurosawa's film will leave you totally enthralled and you will never forget it, largely because of the incredible development of character and the universal human themes portrayed.  Toshiro Mifune, who plays the seventh and final samurai recruited, gives one of the great performances of all time in a mixture of comic and serious acting that will leave you marvelling at his range and his facial and body language -- you don't even need the subtitles to appreciate his greatness.  Takashi Shimoru, as the lead samurai, is masterful, conveying wisdom, judgment, leadership and dignity, with wonderful subtelty.  The rest of the cast are fabulous as well, with each of the samurai playing a role in the group dynamic.  Particularly fine are the young hero worshipper who looks on Shimoru as if he were a god and the serious, emotionless samurai who only wants to perfect his art.  The battle scenes are among the greatest ever filmed, and despite the epic length, you will be absolutely enthralled.
0553571338|4.0|Making you feel what you are reading is the sign of a great book (or movie).  I would love to give it 5 stars, but the ending is too weak.  Don't let that stop you from getting it...it's a great book.
0790731509|5.0|Even if you never saw Paul Newman in another role, you would conclude from his magnificent portrayal of the enigmatic title character (arrested and imprisoned for a minor act of property destruction in the deep South of the early 60's, who defies authority and eventually, like Christ, dies for his sins) that he is one of the great actors of our age.  From the arrest scene, where Newman denies knowing why he committed his crime, to the famous scene where he devours countless eggs in a prison contest, to the poignant scene with his apparently alcoholic and degenerate mother, to the amazing understated scene where he strums his guitar and sings the underground classic &quot;Plastic Jesus,&quot; and so on, Newman displays an astonishing range and is a compelling, captivating, anti-hero.  George Kennedy is similarly wonderful as the de facto head of the jailhouse gang who at first exclude but then come to embrace Newman.  Strother Martin is the personification of redneck evil, delivering the famous line, &quot;What we have here is failure to communicate.&quot;  (Contrary to popular belief, it is not &quot;a failure to communicate.&quot; ) Get it, watch it, appreciate it.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|It's about frickin' time we had something different that has mainstream appeal. ATDI is the first band I've come across in a long time where I honestly can't place them in a particular category. They're not quite punk, they're not quite art-rock (a la Deftones, etc.), they're not quite heavy metal. It almost sounds like The Beastie Boys meet The Pixies in some cases. At first, I was a little skeptical of purchasing this because One Armed Scissor didn't really appeal to me at first. I decided to check this out mainly because of all the critical appeal, and it's the first album that critics have raved about that I actually like. One Armed Scissor is a great, energetic song, but if it doesn't appeal to you at first, you should at least give it a couple of listens, first. The other songs worth mentioning are Non-Zero Possibility, One Armed Scissor, Pattern Against User, and Invalid Litter Dept. The one thing you will have to get past while listening to this album is the singer's monotonus voice. Other than that, this CD kicks a$$, and ATDI is going to be huge. This is one band that'll definately get some attention in the near future. I'm going to check these guys out when they come to my town. This is a good CD for alternative fans.
0553106635|3.0|It is interesting to note that most reviews for this series give 4 to 5 stars.  Mr. Martin has embarked on an ambitious project to bring us, the readers of fantasy, a new &quot;epic&quot;. However, he does seem to overdo it at times in regard to gratuitous gore.  This book is not as well written as the previous two.  As you will find many of the characters disappear at a somewhat alarming rate.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  We have come to know that anyone is expendable to this writer.  Hopefully the deaths serve some purpose as did the deaths of Ned Stark and Robert the King.  I enjoy these books but am not ready, as I have witnessed some reviewers do, to proclaim this series the best fantasy ever written.  In fact while Mr. Martin does not over indulge in the use of sorcery, dragons and talking trees...he does not even come in as a close second to the greatest fantasy series ever written, but then no one comes in close to Tolkiens' Lord of the Rings.
0375704027|4.0|Toru is a student who cannot come to grips with his life. He loves Naoko, who is even more unbalanced than Toru. Naoko winds up in some obscure institution. Toru is ready to fall apart, but is rescued at the last moment by a real-life woman.<br />No doubt the story is written beautifully and, standing on its own, should be recommended. But: If you ever read any of Mr. Murakami's other books, then you know the contents of this book without reading it. After a while, it gets to be monotonous.
B00005214X|5.0|All Things Must Pass is timeless. Now that it has been digitally remastered, it is even better. George's new version of My Sweet Lord is really warm and down to earth. A pleasure to listen to. I strongly recommend it to any Beatles fan.
158234082X|3.0|Are you interested in this book because you read an excerpt about sanitary practices in the kitchen (the &quot;no fish on Monday&quot; rule)?  Don't bother reading the rest of the book, then--only one chapter deals with that area.<br />For all of Bourdain's waxing lyrical about how he got turned on to fine food during a family trip to France, we hear remarkably little about what he himself cooks now, or what he likes eating.   <br />I much much much preferred Michael Ruhlman's insider view of the culinary world; &quot;The Making of a Chef&quot; and &quot;The Soul of a Chef&quot; did far more to impress me with all of the hard work that goes on in a professional kitchen, and with how people work their way up to chefdom.  Ruhlman made me want to try the food of just about every chef he described; Bourdain's writing did nothing for my taste buds.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This is truly a fantastic and mind boggling album, chronicling each part of young Jimi Hendrix's blossoming career up until his untimely 1970 death.  Every single track is a gem, with fantastic guitar ax work and mind boggling lyrics, sometimes sad, sometimes chilling, and always descriptive and truthful.<br />In my opinion, the blossoming Hendrix fan cannot go wrong with this album.  Each of the twenty tracks was well selected, and each represent different parts of his career.  It is truly great, but it doesn't do Jimi complete justice.  Live was where Jimi was at his best, as shown by the albums &quot;Live At Woodstock&quot; and &quot;Live at the Fillmore East.&quot;  I'd recommend picking up both this and a live album.<br />The finest songs on the collection are Jimi classics &quot;Purple Haze,&quot; &quot;Voodoo Child,&quot; and &quot;Wind Cries Mary,&quot; in addition to not so well known tracks like &quot;Angel&quot;, and &quot;Night Bird Flying.&quot;<br />If you are new to the world of Jimi and don't know which album to pick up, I advise you to get this record, and get a good overview of the man's entire career.
B000002UDB|5.0|Brilliance and greatness. Even &quot;throw-away&quot; tunes like &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man&quot; (which I love) are great. &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; is the weakest track on the album (other than &quot;Flying&quot;)
0380977281|5.0|Neil Gaiman, who first made his name in the realm of comics (The &quot;Sandman&quot; series), brings his sharp visual sense and encyclopedic grasp of mythology to the writing of an adult fairy tale.  The (literally) stellar result combines the quirky black humor of Tim Burton with the illustrious literary heritage of Lewis Carroll, George MacDonald, James Stephens, Lord Dunsany, and Mervyn Peake.  Fascinating, witty, and compelling, this one belongs on the shelves of any fantasy reader.
0780631684|4.0|This movie takes a revolutionary approach to the teen slasher flick - remove the slasher.  Instead of a dude in a mask, our photogenic heroes are up against Death himself.  Death doesn't need a butcher knife or a fisherman's hook to kill - the instruments of death are everywhere, from the slippery tiles in the bathroom to the can of turpentine in the garage.<br />The filmmakers make the most of style and atmospherics, loading the beginning of the film with almost subliminal foreshadowing, using subtle tricks of light, set, and sound design to enhance the feeling of foreboding.  The result is a film with a unique, look and feel to it, not another run-of-the-mill horror flick.<br />There's also a welcome sense of morbid humor at work here.  It's not precisely the satiric post-modernism of Scream. Rather, it's the blackest kind of comedy: we have to laugh at death, because we can't do anything about it.  <br />I can't say I cared enough about the characters to have an emotional stake in what happened to them, which is the film's only flaw.  Though they're more 3-dimensional than your typical cliched teens, they weren't real enough to elicit my sympathy.<br />Nevertheless, it's a finely crafted thriller, with genuinely disturbing scenes and grim humor amiably rubbing shoulders.  Some said this makes an inconsistent tone, I disagree.  Life itself is tragic one minute, comedic the next.  You just have to roll with it.  The comedic scenes don't diminish the horror, or vice versa.  <br />The DVD is a five-star treatment, with several deleted scenes leading up to an alternate ending that fell victim to audience testing.  It's a more philosophical ending, but almost ridiculous in its earnestness and not quite true to the spirit of the film; still, it's interesting to see.  There are also two commentary tracks, one with the filmmakers and one with the actors.  Add to that assorted documentaries and games, and you've got hours of fun.<br />Definitely a cut above your average teen-in-peril flick.  If you're a horror fan, you'll enjoy this.
B000059PRW|3.0|This Movie Had some very Remeberable parts in it! It's not as good as the first one but it is entertaining. This Video has several different stories in one. There's this one story about a woman who picks up a hitchhiker unwillingly and can't get rid of him. Even after Death! Heh! THANKS FOR THE RIDE LADY! To understand you must SEE! You won't regret this purchase!
B0000508U6|5.0|Breakups, letdowns, and hangups, all familiar characteristics of a ruined or unrealistic relationship. Yet, Coldplay decides to reiterate these popular song traits in every song (11 total) on their debut album.  BORING...no.  It's actually refreshing.  It's like this guy is actually grovelling in each song to some girl from the past or present, to forgive him, let him be, or take him back.  He does it with a humbleness that could only come from a debut album (especially of one of this calibur).  Coldplay's music somehow picks you up and makes you smile and somehow brainwashes you into a Coldplay song humming machine.
B000002MG1|5.0|After the meandering, experimental Out of Time (1990), REM released this masterpiece.  Automatic for the People features lush orchestral arrangements that compliment emotive, transcendent songwriting.  REM's ambitions are always realized on a personal level that feels natural and Automatic for the People is best work from a band responsible for some of the best music of the last twenty years.<br />REM dabbled with Wilson-esque arrangements on their previous release, but their approach seemed insubstantial and often imitative.  On Automatic for the People, their ambitions are focused and self-assured.  The musical arrangements (by John Paul Jones) are among the most gorgeous in the history of popular music.  The music recalls seminal work of artists such as Wilson and Led Zeppelin without digressing to imitation.  Automatic for the People contains some of the most trenchant, beautiful orchestrations in the history of popular music.<br />The lush, sophisticated music perfectly compliments Stipe's ruminations on a variety of human experiences.  Such lofty ambitions usually lead to tedious pontifications, but Stipe always manages to put a human face on the most universal themes.  The opening track, &quot;Drive&quot;, perfectly captures the simultaneous excitement/anxiety of late adolescent freedom.  &quot;Try not to Breathe&quot; can be interpreted as pro-euthanasia treatise told throught the perspective of an elderly, terminally-ill patient (&quot;I will try not to breathe, This decision is mine, I have lived a full life, These are the eyes that I want you to remember&quot;).  &quot;Star Me Kitten&quot;, borrows it's musical arrangement from the Beach Boys, &quot;Don't Talk (Put your Head on my Shoulder&quot;).  It's one of the funniest, most honest songs about relationships ever written as Stipe croons, &quot;I'm in your possession, Nothing's free, So f**k me kitten&quot;.  The penultimate track, &quot;Nightswimming&quot;, features an indescribably beautiful orchestration that augments Stipe's melancholic lyrics describing the idealistic, fleeting nature of adolescent romance.  The closer, &quot;Find the River&quot;, is the perfect conclusion; self-determinism has seldom been expressed with such personal assurance.  &quot;Find the River&quot;, is somber, but also offers a glimpse of hope.<br />Automatic for the People does contain one minor, but definite flaw.  The jarring, nondescript, anti-Republican diatribe, &quot;Ignoreland&quot;, is perfunctory; both musically and thematically.  In the face the other sublime, timeless songs, &quot;Ignoreland&quot;, is like unexpectedly hitting a pothole while driving along a picturesque road.  I suspect the track was only included as a show of support for the Democratics (Automatic for the People was released during an election year and REM were ardent supporters of the Clinton-Gore ticket).  Whether you agree with their politics or not, such an overtly political song just doesn't mesh with the other material.  However, if you program your CD player to skip that track, the album is flawless.<br />Automatic of the People is a timeless masterpiece that will probably stand as REM's best work.  Like most great music, it's sounds somewhat familiar, but is also unique in it's greatness.  Rarely, if ever, have such ambitions (both lyrical and musical) been realized on such an intimate personal level.  The deep, sustained emotional resonance of Automatic for the People is remarkable.  Despite it's largely somber tone, REM never neglect their musical sensibilities; Automatic for the People is entirely listenable and never seems artificial.  REM's ability to transcend thematic, musical, and temporal boundaries has resulted in the best album of the 1990s, and one of the best in the history of popular music.tion that augments Stipe's melancholic lyrics describing the idealistic, fleeting nature of adolescent romance.

0789723107|5.0|As a web designer of just over 3 years, I was skeptical at what this book would offer me.  Needless to say, I was quite impressed by what I read. The sections on usability testing didn't do much for me, although they were well written and practical. The real benefit of this book for me, and other designers as well, was the approach to usability. Too often designers get caught up in design and fail to think about the practicality and usability of that design. Krug sheds light on some basic principals (including home page design and the amount of text many of us tend to cram onto web pages) and shows how to make more usable web sites. Whether your a new designer or an old hand at this field, this book is an enjoyable, informative read. Written very informally, it feels like a conversation and not a lecture. My only complaint? It's too short. I breezed through this in one day. Still, the principals covered and the impact they're had on my work since then make this title worth the price.
B000002G7G|5.0|For their third album that avante-garage heavy metal folk pop band produce their prettiest and most reflective album. Late sixties folk with two great rockers and one eight minute bizarre sonic experimentation (perhaps obligatory, `tis the Velvets). The sound quality is unusual, as the late Sterling Morrison once remarked, &quot;...the sound is flat, two-dimensional, like we recorded it in a closet. I like it.&quot; but more importantly are the wonderful lyrics. The band claimed &quot;Candy Says&quot; was inspired by Warhol transvestite Candy Darling, but my sister swears it's really about a teenage girl. Next you hear some guy wondering &quot;What Goes On&quot;; scratching his head, `cause he just don't understand his woman. Two lovers (Tom and Marguerita) have a smart and funny talk about sex and love and all that good stuff, narrated with a great sly vocal by non-singer Lou Reed. Then what follows is a recollection of a messy affair with a married woman (perhaps it was meant to be about Tom, but I once heard it was about Lou). The first half of the album ends with a lovely little Christian ditty, which is rather amusing considering Reed is Jewish. In &quot;Beginning To See The Light&quot; the protagonist falls in love, but sadly alas, no go. Perhaps in the next song he is flailing about searching for spiritual comfort only to be &quot;... set free, to find a new illusion&quot;. The next short number verges on a country shuffle; what's the song about? Got me, but the words sound good. The strange onslaught &quot;The Murder Mystery&quot;, includes some amusing nonsense and puerile lines (only if you're quick to catch `em) probably to ward of any air of &quot;high art&quot;(smart guys and gal), is an experiment in word and phrase rhythm. To drive the point home the last line alludes to Dylan's (Thomas) most famous line. The show closer is another great non-singing vocal by drummer Mo Tucker. Her frail child-like vocal tells the sad tale of being left alone at the bar, with drink in hand, as the closing time lights come up.
B00003BDXG|4.0|The directors cut of NBK does alot of justice to the film and Oliver Stones commentary (the best feature of the dvd in my opinion)really sheds light onto the &quot;darker&quot; areas film.<br />Although somewhat different to original version it still retains enough of the backbone but with quite a few extra shots/sequences previously removed for duration or censorship purposes.<br />Other notable features on the DVD is the documentary &quot;Chaos rising&quot; (look closely at Robert Downey Junior's heroin inflicted physical condition) as well as the deleted scenes such as the alternate ending (which didn't really work for various reasons) are also worth a look. <br />Its definately a tough film to review because on a first sitting typically a viewer would have a knee jerk reaction and condemn the film as overacted murderous trash (which at times it can be.) Ideally I think several screenings are really necessary to properly &quot;read&quot; the film.<br />To be honest i'm not the hugest fan of the film as entertainment but i do enjoy the surreal camera work and semiotic/subliminal driven visuals.  Basically its a film you watch but don't take at face value.  <br />It seems to have a structure where one has to try and disconnect themself with what is being presented on the screen and what the underlying purpose of the visual.  But on the other hand you have to distance yourself and not take it too seriously NBK is a sort of satire that makes parody of Hollywood conventions and contemporary values in society.<br />I don't quite agree with what the film represents in the way of the &quot;purity in murder&quot; (which seems sort of contradictory) but one would be foolish to ignore the themes of a monsterous media based society.  <br />I think NBK is definately a step forward in modern film making and is in the same category as FIGHT CLUB as both are not your typical major studio &quot;good guy/bad guy/happy ending&quot; conventional sort of films. <br />I think it willbe at least another generation before people accept and truly understand what this film symbolises.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The Fight Club DVD was probably one of the best movie purchases I have ever made.  This film easily keeps up to par with such movies as The Matrix or The Usual Suspects.  An explanation of the message the movie conveys, however, would probably take up more than the alotted space- it is NOT JUST ABOUT FIGHTING.  I will, however, say this: Fight Club attacks the most basic norms of our society and brings out truths we just don't want to accept.  Once you fully understand the movie, you will question some of the most basic things you do in daily life.  Fight Club is a MUST-SEE for any movie fanatic with an open mind and enough time to watch it more than twice. (You'll need to if you want to understand it!)  Buy it today- it's well worth your &quot;money&quot;!
B00003CX95|5.0|I'm a big fan of Mel's work for one, so naturally I had to see Braveheart when it first debuted. Its an excellent movie, one of my all time favorites actually. The people that write about how it historically inaccurate I two things to say to them : (1) Did you pay any attention to Mel's interview regarding that very topic? The movie was never INTENDED to be an historical remake for the academic community! (2) Finally, any scholar on earth who &quot;knit picks&quot; too much about the history, they need to loosen up and just enjoy a movie for entertainment value (its not like it was ABSURDLY inaccurate anyway - the main plot WAS true as were the epic battles). Besides there is very VERY little known about the TRUE history of William Wallace, so even if your a huge historical scholar much of the REALITY of the &quot;braveheart story&quot; can only be made on educated guesses at best and blind opinions at worse.<br />For the rest of you just wanting a great movie, with some of the best battle scenes that has ever graced the silver screen as long as top rate acting (there's even a small dash of humor in the film from time to time to balance the otherwise VERY serious nature of the film - this &quot;balancing&quot; use of humor is excellently done in this film!). Its 3 hours long, but its so well made, interesting and there are not that many slow parts that it makes the time tick away fast.
0783229526|5.0|When I first saw this movie I couldn't stop laughing. It is hilarious. It gives such a humorous approach to drug use. Plus Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro give excellent performances. This is definitely one movie you have got to see!!!!!!!!!!!
B000056K04|1.0|I don't know why DMB has traded gold for glitter. The fire and sense of passion are compleatly missing from this album. The sound is generic with a modern pop ring. It makes me want to throw in crash and remember when DMB was one of the most orginal bands around.
0345440757|5.0|I put tips from this book to use the first day I read it and there was a major change in my son right then.  He was calmer, happier, and I was SLEEPING MORE!! whoo hoo!  Tracy Hogg isnt into letting your baby cry and I think thats great.  I didnt use every tip she suggested but the ones I did use saved y sanity. Also, I thought I was identifying what my son's cries meant and with her help, I learned that I was not correct all the time.  Once I started responding to his cries correctly, he fussed alot less.  I resisted some of her suggestions at first, then later tried some of them.  Turns out she was right.  hehe.  A definate must-read.
B0000507R0|5.0|How do I even admit to actually loving this, after spending 15 years in the alternative trenches with Husker Du, Sonic Youth and Nirvana. Yet there is something really majestic about this album, particularly when heard in this DVD-Audio format. Before they got rich, fat and old, Emerson Lake and Palmer, especially with this album, made quite a compelling case for symphonic rock, a trajectory in rock history that really never amounted to much (probably because actual mastery of instruments fell out of fashion). The aural definition in this issue is just stunning and I highly recommend it to those who want to give DVD-Audio a try and to those who want to discover or rediscover ELP and why they were such a monster act in the 70s.
B000003CMB|5.0|Right up there with the great live albums. This is one band i wish i could have heard live, sadly duane and berry died. They do the short songs really well and the long songs never get dull. There is mighty soloing from both guitar players. Duane allman has this little trademark climactic guitar thing he does on 3 of the songs-hot lanta, elizabeth reed and whipping post. He really gets intense. Dickie is awesome too. Th erhythm section are great as are the vocals. This is surely the best allman brothers album out there. If you like blues and /or rock you should dig this. Thank you.
1878424319|5.0|For all the countless Self Help books that abound on the shelves of bookstores both brick and mortar and e-commerce I usually pass on reading them because there seems to be a sameness to the message, a glib tone of enlightenment, that seems like some moments of introspection, if honestly applied, could save the cost of yet another &quot;pathway&quot; map out of despair.  This is most assuredly not the case for don Miguel Ruiz' THE FOUR AGREEMENTS.  With a gifted economy of words, a grateful sparing of self examples, and a firm grounding in historical data that these ideas come from the ancients, Ruiz moves us comfortably toward a realm of changing our lives so that we take charge of our pursuit of happiness.  This is so solidly written, so apparently simple, that only the coldest heart would toss this sacred treasure aside.  Be Impeccable With Your Word, Don't Take Anything Personally, Don't Make Assumptions, and Always Do Your Best: there they are - guideposts for not only survival in our chaotic time but waking up to joy every day and taking that joy to the pillow at night.  This is not a Power Manual: this is an empowerment book.  Read it and begin to live!
0425107469|5.0|&quot;Watchers&quot; is a horror story written by DeanR. Koontz....<br />This book in my opinion is the greatest book Koontz had written yet.  It has everything a book would want to be.  Each character has his or her own plot and when that person meets another important character in the story, their plots combine into like it was one single story.  He always goes into detail with each character explaining their background and where they fit in the story.  If you're a horror story fanatic, this is just the right book for you.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Bjork considers this album to be her best work ever. I agree. As a person who has tirelessly followed her career since her Sugarcubes days, I am stunned at how Bj&ouml;rk has managed to lift her music another notch and become truly other-wordly. Its albums like this that make me wonder why I ever thought Tori Amos was a demi Goddess, or that Fiona Apple was as good as they come. 'Selmasongs' is a revelation, and also a showstopper - I doubt anything on Bj&ouml;rk's new album 'Vespertine' could rival the musical genius of this CD.<br />That said, this is meant to be a review of the CD and not a critical analysis of the artist's musical growth, so lets move on. I must emphasize that this album is best appreciated only if you've actually seen the movie. If you haven't, don't go here. And while its true that Selmasongs is NOT a soundtrack in the real sense of the term (all the songs are studio-sung and barely resemble the songs on the screen), it is also not an EP or a regular album. Once again, our Icelandic diva has managed to triumph over genre and typecasting to create something so new and revolutionary, that it takes your breath away.<br />1. Overture : The theme to the film is also the tune to 'New World' and 'The Next to last Song'. It opens the movie, in a long drawn sequence that is meant to evoke the sentiment that life is one big open canvas.<br />2. Cvalda : The equivalent to 'Its Oh so Quiet' but more musically creative. 'Zing boom' becomes 'Clatter Crash', and when Catherine Deneuve steps in to give Bjork a hand with the vocals, you know that this is an instant masterpiece. Using electronica, machinery, and industrial harmonies, Bjork has managed to do what Tricky and Goldie could not - to create the ultimate example of factory-blend alterna. 'Cvalda' is the perfect song to kick off the soundtrack, and is also the first musical number in the movie.<br />3. I've seen it all - Despite being sung by a different male voice (Thom Yorke, in this case), the track retains its freshness, and while it is certainly novel, it seems rather contrived and formulated - guess they had to have one track on here that stuck with convention and modern rhythm. Lars Von Trier is said to have monitored the making of this song keenly and all the over-interest has not managed to kill it off totally. Its a wonderful orchestral and vocal piece, and the lyrics are beautiful.<br />4. Scatterheart : While this is the most chilling songs on the screen, Bjork insisted on rewriting it for the soundtrack. The result is a hacked, lyrically different version from the one on film. The haunting child vocal ('You just did what you had to do') is replaced by the more pensive 'You just have to find out for yourself' sung by Bjork. This is not bad, but I did miss the original version. The new song also doesn't reveal as much of the storyline as the movie version's does. But of course.<br />5. In the Musicals : This has become one of my favorite Bjork tracks. It is unique and breathtaking, and I have played it over, imagining how Bjork must have constructed such a multi-layered song from scratch. One on hand, the song serves as a fantasy for Selma as she sits in the courtroom while people decide her fate. On another, its a 50s style musical number, the likes of which have not been seen ever. On yet another, its a spiritual hymn thats both uplifting and devastating in its' simplicity. I was awestruck the first time I saw this on screen, and the faithful reproduction on CD is wonderful. Look out for the Gene Kelly-style dance interlude.<br />6. 107 Steps : If you've seen the film, you'll know what happens during this sequence. I can't help skip this track, although beautifully rendered as it brings back too many memories of the film and I am afraid I do not have the strength to sit through those emotions a second time. 'Dancer in the Dark' is the most powerful movie I have ever seen.<br />7. New World : The best song Bj&ouml;rk has ever recorded. Period. Listeners have noticed that this song is actually 'The Next to last song' with instrumentation and a different meter and placing. Its a soaring ballad, sung from the point of view of a blind woman. Her imagery and sense of perception are so touching and heartbreaking. When the chorus soars as Bjork wraps up the second verse, you know that this is what music is all about. Its not about Madonna, or Eminem or Rolling Stone. Its about being able to breathe and live yourself through your music, and Bjork has done that with this CD. Brilliant and a masterpiece.<br />I initially agreed that this CD was overpriced, but I have come to realize that it is well worth the full price of the album. A small price to pay for such a divine gift. Stunning, a work of art.ced that this song is actually 'The Next to last song' with instrumentation and a different meter and placing.

B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck has proven yet again that in an industry seemingly obsessed with youth, truely talented artists will continue to florish regardless of age.  &quot;You Asked For It&quot; is simply outstanding!  Just when I thought Jeff Beck produced some of his best work ever in &quot;Jeff Beck, Who Else!&quot; the &quot;You Asked For It&quot; album comes along and just completely amazes me.<br />Anyone that loves really great guitar work has to admit that Jeff is definitely a Master's Master.  He has taken his technique to an all-time high to achieve an even greater pinnacle of Masterpiece work.<br />Just as with &quot;Who Else,&quot; Jeff continues to explore new horizons and push the boundaries of contemporary music.  His music is like a breath of fresh air in an era where the recording industry is pushing out nothing but really bad, over-processed, uninspiring noise they insist on calling music.<br />Jeff Beck is the real deal, and he proves it yet again with another great albun!
6304806442|4.0|The effect of heroin addiction on a young man and his closest friends is explored in the hard-hitting drama, \\"Trainspotting,\\" directed by Danny Boyle.  Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a \\"way of\\" life, they have \\"become\\" his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him:  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to \\"Rents\\" the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can:  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to.  The film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the \\"filthiest toilet in Scotland.\\"  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go \\"cold turkey.\\"  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.   McGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself:  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not.  The supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, \\"Trainspotting\\" will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable.  A great companion feature to the more recent \\"Traffic,\\" this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.  Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.
B000009QPE|5.0|People call Slayer death metal, but I disagree totally.  To me, death metal is inaudible drums with loud guitars strumming three notes and the singer screaming and talking.  But Slayer has actual riffs and they play their guitars, something a ton of bands don't do today.  This album is not for the faint of heart or ear.  Fast and furious, this CD will make you wanna break everything.  I started liking Slayer when I saw the live video for Raining Blood.  So naturally, I got this CD.  Angel of Death, Postmortem, all great songs as well.  If you call yourself a metalhead, get this.  And for all of you Korn loving people who think that that music is rebellious, get THIS and see how horrible Korn, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, and Crazy Town really are.  Slayer are the kings of thrash.
B000002UJQ|5.0|&quot;Whoa, is this the same band that gave us Pablo Honey?&quot; The first time I heard OK Computer my jaw dropped at that thought. You have to give them credit, Radiohead has just come soo far. I have all their albums and in my opinion, this is their best work. Kid A is also great, but there seems to be just a little too much contrast between the songs. It's dramatically different from their other albums. (We seem to say that every time, don't we?) Don't let that stop you from getting it though. Get OK computer first, if this would be your first Radiohead CD. The songs on this album are incredibly beautiful, emotional, and hauntingly sincere. My favorite has to be Paranoid Android, which is one of the best songs I have EVER heard. The music video for this song is animated and I suggest watching it, if you ever get the chance. Buy this album, and if you have any money left over, get The Bends.
0140177396|4.0|I read the novel Of Mice and Men, which was recommended to me by my cousin.  He told me the book wasn't that long and the story was really nice.  So I went to the library and checked it out.  When I first started to read the book it seemed kind of boring because the two main characters where just talking back and forth, but after the first two chapters I couldn't put the book down.  It was a wonderful book and I had a great time reading it.  While I was reading this book it made me think about me and my friends and what friendship really is.  <br />Of Mice and Men is a story about a relationship between two friends who travel around California, working on farms.  Lennie is a big, giant, strong man with the mind of a small child traveling with George, a short, smart guy who not only looks after himself but also has to look after his job and take care of his mentally retarded friend, Lennie.  George is like Lennie's older brother who watches out for him all the time.  Lennie does unintelligent things like carry around dead mouse in this pocket and George always yells at Lennie and gets mad at him yet, George can't go on with his life without Lennie.  They travel together working hard on farms and saving up money so their dream can come true.  All they want is a place of their own with chicken, rabbits, horses, and other farm animals.  On their way to their dream they stop at a farm to make some money where things go wrong because Lennie likes to touch, pet, and hold on to soft things.  Their dream is ruined because of Lennie's habit.  Lennie likes to touch all things that are soft, and I mean all things that are soft, even a woman's soft pretty dress, or her soft silky hair, which gets Lennie killed by his best friend.  George decides that he can no longer protect Lennie from the horrible things that he hadn't intended to do.  This was a really hard decision for George but he knew the outcome was going to be the best for both him and Lennie.  <br />Of Mice and Men takes you through life changing events, problems, and dreams of two poor laborers who just want a place of their own, which is just like many people in the world.  Many families and friends work together so their dreams can come true.  This book also made think of friendship and how we treat our friends and others in the world who are different, and less intelligent then us.  People treat others bad, and put them down just because they are different.  Even though the ending of this novel seems sad, and heart breaking, I think George did the right thing; he didn't want his friend to live the hard harsh life, in this unkind world.  After reading this book, it made me realize that John Steinbeck is a wonderful author and I loved his writing style.  It simple, easy to understand, relates to life, teaches you something and leaves you with something to think about.  I am a person who doesn't like to read much but when I am assigned to read for a class I tend to find books that interest me.  In the future I plan to read this book again and I also want read more of John Steinbeck's novels.
B000051VWW|4.0|Although this album is not Sade's best work, it is however very good. You'll reminisce of previous recordings like \\"Smooth Operator\\" and \\"Ordinary Love\\" when you hear \\"By Your Side\\" and the CD's title track, \\"Lover's Rock.\\" I strongly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys soft, soothing music and most obviously to any Sade fan.
B000056K04|5.0|Even before this came out, people were up in arms over the &quot;new&quot; sound on this album.  Then how come, with the notable omission of the lengthy jams, this album finally captures the energy DMB has live?<br />The chorus of &quot;When the World Ends&quot; blasts like the band only ever has done in concert, for instance.  Same goes for &quot;The Space Between.&quot;<br />&quot;Sleep to Dream Her&quot;, with its instrumental chorus that makes you yearn for summer, is stellar.  &quot;Angel&quot; is one of those songs where Dave is going to make all the ladies (and maybe some of the men) melt when they hear it.  It's another &quot;Crash Into You&quot; except it starts with a Hendrix-style electric riff instead of acoustic strumming.  The title track, opening with a bone shaking Gospel-type chorus, is a great way to close out this strong album.<br />If there is any song that isn't as good as the others, it might be opener &quot;I Did It&quot;--the song that has so many writing off this disc before they listen a little further into the album.  I think that's unfortunate.    Bottom line here is that the songs are tight.  To say this is not a good effort by the band ignores what's actually on here.  If you want to listen to &quot;Jimi Thing&quot; and &quot;Lie In Our Graves&quot; over and over, then put their respective CDs in.  But don't, by any means, be afraid to let a band tinker with your perceptions of what they do.  You might LIKE the results more than you thought.<br />In 1996, Pearl Jam released No Code to similar moans and groans of fans wanting to hear another &quot;Evenflow.&quot;  Yet, on their 2000 tour, songs from that disc got some of the heaviest applause from sold out crowds.  The same thing will apply here.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|The plot is the plot from any Scream Movie,when a killer calls women and then kills them.I saw this movie on Pay-Pre-View along with Scream 3 and Coyote Ugly.It was an cool movie but the only thing was it was not like Screams were!Casey from the opening of Scream 1 did not have a tit made out of ice but still...It's Kewl!
B00004YW6I|4.0|I loved P.J. Harvey's c.d. To Bring You My Love and I think it confirmed her as one of the most innovative artists around.So I was really looking forward to this c.d. after her long sebatical.Thankfully it doesn't dissappoint,even though I don't think it's quite as good as the c.d. mentioned at the start.<br /> Firstly it's quite different.She seems to have gone back to a much rawer sort of sound.There's far less vocal distortion and use of production room trickery.It brings her now very close to the sound of Patti Smith an artist she seems to clearly admire.The songs were written as the title of the c.d. suggests partly in the city-New York and partly in England-somwhere quiet by the sea.The songs are as strong as anything she has done before.My only criticism is that she seems to have left behing some of her previous experimentation.Many of the songs do sound very similar.The first three songs are strong and quite commercial rock songs-with a very standard guitar,bass,drums combo.Vocally she's as good as ever on these songs.<br /> One Line sees the first of the songs which sees her collaborating with Thom Yorke.It's a moodier affair and his backing vocals definitely take a back seat but add plenty of atmosphere.She sings,while he croons away in the background.This song really builds up in tension all the way and when you expect it to have a pulsating ending it teases you and goes all quiet and moody.The next has Yorke singing in full duet here.What a song it is-P.J. Harvey on vocals and guitar and just Thom Yorke on vocals are neede on this song-a magnificent performance by all concerned.<br /> Song 6 with it's very long and clever title leave the &quot;sea&quot; and reflect the hustle and noise of the &quot;city&quot;.And here you now realise why this title is so apt.The songs like this one and the first two especially are full on rock and reflect her time in New York.The quieter mooodier affairs like the songs with Yorke reflect her time by the sea.The contrastis perfect and she mixes the songs so you never get bored with a similar sound and feel.I think the song &quot;This Mess We're In&quot; is the best of her collaborations with Yorke.It sounds more Radiohead then &quot;Kid A&quot;.In fact Yorke dominates this song more then Polly Jane.Song 8 comes as a bit of a surprise as it's got a folky more upbeat and light-hearted attitude and sound.Lyrically it's so good-describing living in New York and looking out on the skyline but reflecting where she came from.It's hard to big a dud track on this one-but if I had to pick one it would certainly be the next song.It's basically just a standard rock rant!<br /> Song 10 is great.It sounds closest to the songs from To Bring You My Love-the buitar sound is totally grinding and has a very deep,bass feel to it.It's also P.J. sounding at her most angry-even though the lyrics are very up-beat.Horses In My Dreams is one of the longer songs on the c.d.It's a very reflective,slow-moving moody song and is the most instrumental of the songs.The final song is an 6 minute epic.It's also one of this c.d.'s best songs.From a simple beginning of three piano keys backing vocals-it builds into the full band coming in.Lyrically it puts the whole c.d. into some perspective as P.J. sings on the chorus &quot;But now we float,take life as it comes&quot;.<br /> A very welcome come back for a great solo artist!
B000050XEI|5.0|Even though I'm a hard-core Parrot Head, the first time I heard this, I had to have it! Can't stop listening to it!
B000002ADT|4.0|This is the greatest jazz CD ever! Period.<br />At least, that's what everyone seems to say. I disagree - the album is a true masterpiece; but SO ARE OTHERS. That seems to be constantly discounted. Giant Steps by Coltrane is equally impressive, and some of Sonny Rollins stuff i prefer over this. <br />HOWEVER<br />This CD is actually a sort of milestone - true improvisation. Just for that reason, you ought to check it out. I mean, there are plenty of great jazz CDs - was this one mixed, remixed, redone, and completed after 15 sessions? NO!!! <br />this amazing album is amazing BECAUSE it is so spontaneous. You can almost feel the artists think up the notes as they play, with only Miles' sketches to work with it. Especially with Coltrane's sax solos. AMAZING.<br />SO - to sum it up: An AMAZING JAZZ ALBUM. the greatest jazz album of all time? perhaps. My favorite? Not really...<br />BUT - so many people like it - go buy it. This CD is one of those u can have and brag about how much u love it - its a classic. In the true sense of the word.
B00000DM5P|5.0|This is simply one of the quintessential albums in modern music history. If you don't own it, you should. Oh...and clear out a space in the top drawer of your CD cabinet for this one. It's going to be there for a while.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This cd is AWESOME!  I first heard her voice in the Eminem song, &quot;Stan&quot;, loved her voice, and bought the album.  I am so glad I did!  She takes her songs straight from the heart.  The lyrics are so real, you can just feel every emotion that she sings about.  I swear, at the point in my life that I got the cd, it could have been written about me!  Thats how deep this music is!  This is a MUST HAVE!!!
0195073401|3.0|Currently we are suffering through the endless notation and mind-blowing exercises in &quot;elementary math&quot; (yeah, right!)that comprise the chapters of MWG. To be fair, MWG does indeed give a complete overview of microeconomic theory. However, if you had an insufficient background in math (aka less than a Master's degree) it  can be difficult (more truthfully: impossible) to pull out the intuitive concepts from the overwhelmingly mathy definitions. You will definately need a (more than) competent instructor to  lead you through the quagmire that is MWG.
B00000INEX|4.0|I've had this video and some of the other ones in the series for a couple years now, and my two-and-a-half-year-old son still enjoys it occasionally. When he was very young he was extremely colicky, and sometimes I couldn't do anything to make him stop crying. I discovered that the soothing music and images in this video would very often calm him down. Also, when he was older and would awaken from a nightmare this video was useful in helping him to calm down, more than just sitting with him quietly, because it provided a calming distraction.<br />Besides that, my son really enjoyed watching the video, from before he could sit up until the present, when he can talk about what he is seeing. It shows a fun variety of toys and shapes, which can also serve as a preview of the toys so you can find out which ones you think your child might like to play with.<br />From a parent's perspective, the segments with the kids in it  are sort of annoying, and didn't hold my son's interest as much as the other parts of the video, which is why I only gave this 4 stars.
B00000IQCA|1.0|My patience with films and filmmakers is high, regardless of length or pacing.  I watched the five-hour version of &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; in one afternoon with considerable pleasure.  Conversely, I've sat through incredible stinkers to the last frame, hoping for some worthwhile glimmer that never came.  With a director as demonstrably talented as Robert Altman, it seems impossible that he could create a film sufficiently awful to send me running from the theater in mid-movie.<br />But he did.<br />&quot;Ready to Wear&quot; is unbearable.  Painful.  Unspeakable.  There's nothing here except a colossal waste of talent.  It's not bad in the right way to be unintentionally funny, and God knows the intentional &quot;comedy&quot; isn't funny.  Stay far away from this cinematic torture.
B00003CXFV|5.0|If not necessarily Best Picture.  <br />First I have to state that there is probably no one who is less of a Julia Roberts fan than I.  Her acting talents to me have always seemed pretty run of the mill.  And she can occasionally appear to be stunningly beautiful at most times she appears remarkably average.  So i've never understood the hype<br />We are treated here to an extraordinary performance.  She brings genuine honesty to the role.  I would highly recommend that you read the review of 'RESOLUTE' which I found to be particularly poignant and accurate.  To RESOLUTE: I wish that you would include your email and that you would write more reviews because you really seem to know your stuff ie: Independence Day<br />What I enjoyed most about this film is that the story and the performances carried the day rather than production tricks and hype.  In short the movie is very low key.  It's understated in it's visuals and drama.  The viewer is not forced to like or dislike (the character) Erin Brockavich although she is certainly a sympathetic presence as are Albert Finney and the victims of the dumping.<br />In short I did not expect to like this film and viewed it with reluctance but was treated to a real gem of a film and all involved are to be commended.  It's got all of the elements a great story, well acted, enough laughs and plenty of drama plus ultimately vindication.<br />Bravo!
B000059T5O|4.0|Hammond hits Tom Waits songs from a different angle on this excellent CD.  It is hard to argue that Waits is not the finest songwriter/lyricist of today, but for some, his voice can be difficult to take.  On this album Hammond takes some fine Waits songs and gives them a blues take.  Tom produces and chimes in hear and there- similar to last year's Chuck E. Weiss album &quot;Extremely Cool&quot;.  All in all, this is a fine effort- a good way for Tom's fans to get more material and a good way for non-Tom fans to gain an appreciation for his music.  Nice job John Hammond, I hope this album sells.
0875845851|5.0|Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma is an incredible book about the dangers of focusing on current high margin activities at the cost of future opportunities.  I highly recommend this book.
B000056K04|4.0|I'm a great fan of the DMB and I really enjoyed this cd.  All you die-hard DMB fans should just relax and give this recording a chance.  The songs are much shorter than in the past, most of them coming in  at a radio-friendly four minutes, but the quality of the content is what sets this album apart. I believe Dave has reached into his soul and pulled out some beautiful songs, the kind that aren't possible without some suffering in life.  So buy this CD, put it in the stereo and crank it up, and most importantly, enjoy. Thanks DMB.
0843175648|5.0|If I were to make a list of some of my favorite books from my childhood, Mr. Silly would no doubt be on it! I'm lucky enough to own a hard cover copy of this (that colored in the back of when I was 3). I have also enjoyed reading this to kids now that I'm older--opportunity for interaction and critical thinking skills--What is &quot;normal&quot;? Not a work wearing a monacle and a bright necktie! What sound does a duck really make?  One Sentence Summary: Mr. Silly's backward town is holding its annual competition for the silliest idea of the year. (But how can you really sum up a book in one sentence?)  I'm really pleased to see Mr. Men and Little Miss books available on Amazon. They may not be fancy or award winners, but that's not really what makes a book great! Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with ALL of the stories of this series, but I CAN recommend Mr. Bump, Mr. Messy, Mr. Tickle and Little Miss Plump.
B000059RL3|5.0|I think this is my fourth or fifth version of this album, but by far the best. Great alternate versions of all tunes, live versions and a fantastic booklet.<br />Does anybody know how to get a copy of Ben Edmonds' INNER CITY BLUES: MARVIN GAYE AND THE LAST DAYS OF THE MOTOWN SOUND? Apparently this is a book by the same guy who wrote the notes in the book. If you know where to find a copy, please write me at Lbiondolillo@breakstoneruth.com
0811826848|4.0|I rated this book a 4 because as far as books go it is not a 5 but as far as this kind of book,it is a 10. If you grew up with the Fab Four as I did, anxiously waiting for each and every single, than I think you will enjoy the book immensely. The book is very detailed and interesting but what is most fun is the humour. If you know the then personalities of the Beatles you will burst out laughing at many parts. It also puts the Beatles on a very human level, lets say down to earth. If you are new to the Beatles it is worth the money to have and to find out what the buzz is all about. The book is written as though there is an interviewer asking the questions and you get the responses. what is most interesting is that not everyone has the same perspective or recollection of certain events which makes it seem all the more truthful. I received the book as a gift and am enjoying each and every page.
B000059MEK|5.0|Let me start by saying this CD is really great!     Its definitely Daft Punk's most 80's sounding release, but has a lot more to it than something like \\"Darkdancer\\" by Les Rhythm Digitales. Where that CD was very one sided, \\"Discovery\\" is a kaleidoscope of sound, with so much to hear on so many levels.     The beats are still there - it's like nothing has changed since '97 - but what Daft Punk seem to have done on \\"Discovery\\" for the most part is incorporate all the sounds from their childhoods (the 80's) into these tracks. That means vocoders, heavy metal guitar soloing, FM Rock keyboard sounds, computer game sounds, all stuck together with huge disco beats.     Starting with the single and opening track \\"One More Time\\", you get 14 pieces of funk without the slightly annoying interludes featured on \\"Homework\\". In fact, the only slightly interlude-ish song here is \\"Nightvision\\", and even that sounds like an 10cc / Chicago / Supertramp crossover.     Best songs here are \\"Digital Love\\" (which sounds a bit like Buggles(!)), \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\" (the best use of vocoder I've ever heard) and probably \\"Something About Us\\", only because it's so different from anything they've done before: It sounds like an 80's funk ballad! Hello, Level 42?!    You may have noticed that I've used the phrase \\"80's\\" a lot here. But don't be put off - this is still a very modern sounding album. In fact, it sounds amazing; the production level is very high here.    So buy it basically. If you liked \\"Homework\\", \\"Music Sounds Better With You\\", and the whole Cassius / Air / French genre, you will love this.
B00000255F|5.0|Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited. &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; were the hit singles from either album; each ends with a long, poetic, almost apocalyptic final track (&quot;Desolation Row&quot; and &quot;Jungleland&quot;), and contains shorter up-tempo blues like &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze Out&quot; and &quot;From a Buick Six.&quot; Also, &quot;Backstreets&quot; sounds almost exactly like &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,&quot; especially the intro, which is almost identical (and in the same key). In any event, both albums are incredible.
B000056K04|5.0|If you are a fan of music, you will like this record. DMB charters new territory, tightening up their presentation, while keeping what is so wonderful about their music: the infinite skill and talent that they bring to both their performances and their songwriting.<br />&quot;Everyday&quot; is not like &quot;Crash&quot;, as &quot;Before these crowded streets&quot; was not like &quot;Crash&quot;. And I think that is a very good thing. A lot of self-certified &quot;Dave-heads&quot; have written reviews lamenting how much the band has changed. This is a strange kind of conservatism that is difficult to understand, but it has been seen before. Many were for sure the critics when Beethoven departed his earlier course and opted for commercialism by including a choir in what proved to be his last symphony. &quot;A choir!&quot; the Vienna nobles gasped, very much in the same way as some of the long-time fans of DMB these days gasp &quot;a new producer!&quot; or &quot;an electric guitar!&quot;.<br />Well, maybe some people miss their college days and the old DMB, but they must have been in pain for a long time now (unless their still in college, which means their in pain and in trouble). DMB have developed their music for each new record, and the difference between &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Before these crowded streets&quot; is not greater than the difference between &quot;Before these crowded streets&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot;. <br />So, if you loved &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Before these crowded streets&quot;, and you accept and enjoy artistic innovation, you will love &quot;Everyday&quot;. At least I did.
0783226888|4.0|The Jackal is one of my favorite movies of all time because it relates to real world situations. Everything that took place in the movie can and has already been done. I am a rare viewer who believes that this movie is much better that the original The Day of the Jackal. I believe this way because of the acting and the story line. I like the non emotional pressence in the actors especially in this movie because it puts a more serious property into the film. In the first one the acting was off because at one point the movie was more serious than the next. And the pressence of technology never happened in the first one. There were many things and ideas they could have used at that time. But I liked the story line in both of them. I just believe that the pressence of technology boosted the 1997 version story into first place. After watching the Jackal there is only one flaw that I have discovered. It was that the movie tried to put too much information in a short period of time. I believe it should have been at least thirty minuets longer, then it would be more complete. I believe that Bruce Willis was the best in the movie. I think that this film was the first of Bruce's that actually called for perfection, accuracy, unique properties of the mind, and dark and deep emotions. It was a change from his original action pack movies with terrible catch phrases. I would rank this movie the third best of Bruce Willis. The first two are Unbreakable, and the Sixth Sense. The Jackal just called for a unique style of acting that called for no emotions which was great. It showed accuracy in events in history, and strategic commands. There is almost no flaw in its relation to history other than that he got caught.
B00003CXFU|4.0|4.5 Stars.<br />I'm very glad that the REAL Erin dressed the way she did.  Julia Roberts is able to show off her &quot;stuff&quot; (trying to keep this review family-friendly); although it's a little distracting.  That's the sort of distractions I like!<br />Erin Brockovich follows a story line of &quot;small guy conquearing big guy&quot;.  This true story is reminicent of other good movies we've seen:  SILKWOOD, ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, CHINATOWN...others?  A factory (part of a billion dollar company) poisons the water of a small town and tries to use devious tactics to get out of paying for their mistake.  It has moments that will make you want to cheer for the players on screen-especially Erin as she simply says what she feels.  Roberts and Finney are an excellent NON-STEREOTYPICAL pair and both deserve Oscars.  And here in my state (where Julia is from) we are proud of our pretty &quot;Georgia Girl&quot;!
6304084145|5.0|I have been told that the French predecessor of this film is better, but I don't see how.  The compelling true story of the downfall of the Hapsburg family is recounted here with an emphasis on the personal tragedy of Prince Rudolph.  Here is a man trapped in a loveless marriage, domineered by his tyranical father, deprived of the love of a mother who tries to dazzle everyone, caught in the uprisings of democratic politics, and addicted to cocaine to dismiss his pain.  To add to his personal pain, he meets a beautiful, penniless noblewoman, whose family is basically out of favor, and falls hopeless in love.  The politics, the personal manipulation, the suffering of the lovers is beautifully presented by MGM in their grand style. Sharif may not be the optimal Rudolph, but who could be immune to Catherine Deneuve's charm.  James Mason is a perfect cold and stern Emperor, and Ava Gardner (miscast) fares adequate as the Emperess.  It is James Roberton Justice, who plays the Prince of Wales, who steals the movie.  His every scene is a joy. The European character actors who fill out the cast do a fine job, and the story unfolds as the tragic love should.  Whether you believe that Rudolph killed his mistress and himself, or that his father had the secret police remove him, you will enjoy this movie.  Good musical score too!
0788821075|5.0|Pretty Woman is Julia Roberts's (some of you may know her as the actress who demands $20 million a movie) 2nd movie and one of her best!     Roberts is Vivian Ward, an L.A. hooker who doesn't fancy the job, until she gets asked for directions by a rich guy (Richard Gere) in a silver Lotus. Edward Lewis (Gere) is asking for directions to Beverly Hills, where he will stay on business for the week. Of course, Vivian won't give him directions for FREE! She charges him some money, and she drives him to the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Soon Gere asks her to stay with him for the week for $3,000, and be at his &quot;beckin-call&quot;. Vivian falls in love quickly, and soon finds herself parading around greater Los Angeles -shopping on Rodeo Drive, going to fancy events, etc. with Edward.         The story of this charming movie is NOT just about a Hollywood Blvd. hooker, but it's about 2  very different people teaching eachother some things about life that they didn't know before.        An funny, carefree film!     FIVE STARS!
0671027344|5.0|Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower is perhaps the most wonderful story I've ever read.  And just to let you know, I read a lot, 7 books in the past nine days.  The fact is, that this book is life and more speicifically, it was me, and everything about me.  Chbosky's character development through Charlie's letters just made this wonderful humbling impression on me.<br />When I finished this book today, all I could think of was reading this book over, like Charlie does.  It was absolutely the best ever, and I strongly suggest you BUY this.  It is nearly a bible for anyone who has ever been hurt,ever been in a weird situation ever been in high school or in love.<br />This truly is a masterpiece!  Read this book on the perfect night, during the perfect drive, to feel totally infinite and nostalgic, its the best advice I can give anyone.
0385335482|5.0|As a mom (named Becky, of course) who spends all of her time with children, this book is a fun, cute, romantic and very good way to spend my quiet time, which is very little.  Becky's letters to her creditors are just hilarious, especially when she tries to use &quot;I have found the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; as the reason for not paying her VISA bill! I couldn't put this down, and looked forward to the times at night I could read it!
B00003CX6P|5.0|&quot;The Talented Mr Ripley&quot; should be Required Viewing for Film Students on How to Correctly Develop Characters, Story and Suspense without resorting to Tired Plot Twists or Cheap Thrills. This Leisurely Paced Thriller doesn't waste a second, every Shot, every Gesture, every Line of Dialogue is there to show us something. It really is a Perfect Thriller, by all standards.<br />Each Character is so well developed, I found myself Rooting for Everybody. There wasn't one character that I wanted fare to come to; even Ripley had me felling sorry for him. Matt Damon plays the part of Tom Ripley with such enthusiasm and Seasoned Skills, he proves he is the Naturally Brilliant Actor we Thought he'd be twenty years down the track. He is totally in the character at all times, and so believable it is Scary. He brings every thought and emotion to his face and he never once Over or Underplays Ripley, his Casting was Genius. <br />Gwyneth Paltrow gives the Performance of her Career as Marge, Dickie's Girlfriend. She plays her as Spirited, Happy and Full of Life for the First half, and as Bitter, Untrusting and Aged for the Finale. She Proves herself a real, wonderful actress, with all the Grace and beauty of Grace Kelly. <br />Alot of Critics and Audiences felt that Jude Law stole the show as Dickie Greenleaf, the man of Ripleys Obsession. As far as This Reviewer is Concerned, Matt Damon is the star all the way, though Jude plays a Good Second Fiddle. He Too gives the Performance of his Young Career. <br />PT Anderson favourites Philip Seymour Hoffman and Philip Baker Hall appear in the truly Magnolia... (an Intended Mistake) Magnificent Supporting Cast. They are Both Outshined by Cate Blanchett and Jack Davenport as two people caught in Ripleys Web of Deception.<br />I really fell that had Censorship been less strict in his time, Alfred Hitchcock would have made &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; more like this Modern Ripley tale. The Homosexual Undertones would have been brought out of the closet more and the characters more Honest. I can picture the Masters take on this tale. Anthony Perkins as Ripley, Cary Grant as Dickie and (of course) Grace Kelly as Marge.<br />&quot;The Talented Mr Ripley&quot; is a Perfect Thriller. It doesn't cheat the audience in any way, as many modern thrillers do. Performance, Direction, Plot, Sets, Make Up, Music... It's Faultless in Every Field. After all the acclaim I and others have given it, it is Still Underrated.
6301966562|4.0|Personal Computing was a fairly new concept in the early-eighties when this film was released,and,in it's own cute little way,&quot;Electric Dreams&quot; expresses people's fears and misunderstanding of this new idea.The story is simple:boy-meets-girl,boy-has-competition-for-girl,complications ensue.The twist here is,his competition is his computer,which,in a laughably naive plot point,has come to life after wine is spilled in the key-board.The computer(which was already programmed to control things in the apartment like the sucurity system,and turning on and off small appliances)then develops a mind of it's own,as well as an eye for it's owner's girlfriend.What ensues is a charming romance-comedy,directed with surprising flair,as this was also when music videos were first catching on.Seen from today's standpoint,when virtually everyone with access to a phone-line is computer savvy,&quot;Electeric Dreams&quot; seems amusingly dated,but it does serve as a sort of cultural time capsule of a time when the cyber-nation was in it's infancy.Removed from that context,however,this is a very enjoyable little film,and the leads,Lenny Von Dohlen and a divinely beautiful Virginia Madsen,are likable and give good performances.All in all,I have to give this a high recommendation.
B000002AVF|3.0|This is Mariah's second and last diamond (10 million copies+) album. During the time this album was released, Puffy-esque R&amp;B/Hip-pop ruled the charts and this album capitalizes upon it with the memorable Tom Tom Club remake of &quot;Fantasy&quot; (the video of the song was wonderful as well). Too bad the remix of &quot;Fantasy&quot; isn't on this album. It was extremely memorable and helped catapult this album to the top of the charts worldwide. And plus, how could we ever forget the worldwide number one smash (and #1 for 16 weeks blockbuster) &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;? No wonder this album did so well commerically. Aristically however, the album falters immensely. There's too many AC lackluster tunes and listless filler material. Not really a memorable album but its two warhorses (&quot;Fantasy&quot; &amp; &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;) far outshine the rest.

B000002UAR|5.0|Which album is the best.  Its between Radiohead's O.K. Computer and the Beatles' Revolver on every list Ive seen.  I beleive both these albums deserve consideration.  This is definately the best album by the Beatles, mostly because no other flows together as well.  This is what I thought of some of Revolvers songs. <br />Taxman :Very catchy, the lyrics provide a satirical look at taxes.  I guess at the time it was a political statement, but know its hard to take seriously, mostly because of words like &quot;you get 1 I get 19&quot;.  Reminds of the old Batman song.<br />Eleanor Rigby :Wow, this is one of my favourite Beatles songs of all time.  Its very sad and almost brings tears in my eyes with every listen.  The orchestra is perfect and so is everything else.  Musical perfection.<br />I'm Only Sleeping :Lennon is awesome.  The title says alot about this one.  Comparable to A Pillow of Winds by  Pink Floyd. Very sleepy but the Beatles are more melodic.  This one is ahead of its time.  When someone can write a great song about something like sleep thats when he becomes more than man, he becomes legend.<br />Good Day Sunshine :Lennon is great on piano here.  This is the brightest trak on revolver.  It really captures the feeling of happiness like no other song had or ever will.<br />And Your Bird Can Sing :Very catchy, a true hippy song.  The most perfect melody that Ive ever heard.<br />Tomorrow Never Knows :Way ahead of its time, every recording trick most of been used int his one at the time.  Not unlike Pink Floyd (ten years later) or Radiohead ( 20 years later).  Im very impressed with this one.  Those sonic shreaks broke new ground and extended the Beatles immortality.
B000002UAX|4.0|I became a huge Beatles-fan after buying Revolver and Rubber Soul, two albums I still regard as great, even faboulous. I many times held this album in my hands at the record-store before I finally decided that it would probobly be worth all the money it cost and so I bought it. And yes, it was, and is, a great album, a very Beatles-ish album, occasionally a strong songwriting/singing/instrumenatal-effort. My instant favourites were &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, &quot;Happiness...&quot; and of course the Lennon-classic &quot;I'm So Tired&quot;. But there are many more. Many good songs except these. But then there are the 'not-so-good' songs which makes you a bit disappointed. These are, in particular, &quot;Why don't we do it in the road?&quot;, &quot;Everybody's got something to hide...&quot; and &quot;Julia&quot;. But still it holds up, and is one of the Beatles' finest moments.
B000059T5O|5.0|The first question is why did this CD happen?  It's not possible to improve on perfection, which is how I'd summarize the Tom Waits catalogue as sampled on this release.  What's more curious is why would ol' Tom hisownself produce and play guitar on it, bringing along some of his steel-forged backing musicians.<br />The answer, I suppose, is this was gonna happen anyway, so Waits decided to control it.  That's why I love the disc.  That's why you oughta buy it.  You'll love it too.<br />13 songs, 12 by TW, spanning a career with more great songs than should be allowed by the natural laws of talent.  And not one version is disrespectful to the original.  Hammond-the-Younger is a darn-fine bluesist who has enjoyed &quot;critical acclaim&quot; with less-than-remarkable sales.  If there is a God of Deserving Artists, He (She?)will shine the light of success this time.<br />Hammond -- nobody, really! -- can faithfully replicate Waits's  whiskey-and-tobacco vocals. So what's missing in texture is made up for with lyrics that are easier to understand.  Still, neither the edge nor attitude of the songs are compromised. <br />I suspect that with repeated listenings this will wind up on my Top-10 list for Twenty-Ought-One. <br />This CD is not Tom Waits Lite for mass consumption.  Taste's great. But not less filling.
B000002UB3|5.0|Their last studio album is also their best, which makes you fantasize about what would have happened if they wouldn't have split up, if they would have made another record (I count &quot;Let It Be&quot; as more of a livealbum), could it have been even better, and how would it have sounded???<br />But, all good things come just once, and Abbey Road is a great way to end one's carrier, perhaps the greatest ever. My favourite songs are &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;, &quot;I Want You&quot; and the entire side two, the great McCartney-medley, the very intelligent mix of very intelligent songs. Whenever the intro of &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; comes out of my recordplayer I just can't believe how good it is. When the intro-riff of &quot;Sun King&quot; and the piano of &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; reach my ears, I just stop for a moment and contary to what Bono says it's a moment that I want to be stuck in.<br />If you haven't got any Beatles-albums (except maybe the #1-collection which I believe everybody has by now and doesn't contain more than 20 per cent of their greatest songs) and are thinking about giving one a try - I suggest you go for this one, or maybe &quot;Revolver&quot;, another, earlier great album. Have a nice day.
0679805273|5.0|Excellent purchase as graduation gift!  A personal note on the front wishing them a safe journey to college or trade school or in persuing a career is the perfect finishing touch.  If you always give money to the grad, consider this book as an addition to the gift. Parents, it's a great idea for your own kids. As a former high school English teacher and mom, it was the standard gift for all the kids, and we still get thanks and smiles from young adults who loved the book!
0385334206|3.0|This was my first visit with Kurt Vonnegut. I'm keen now tospend some more time with him although I'll be surprised if he sticksto this spare style in his other books. The drawings in my edition ofthe book are a bit out of place ... but the book shows that you can betremendously effective without big words and flowery prose.
0061091480|5.0|I am a Chinese and I read the Chinese version of the book when I was about 16. It changed my entire point of view to the world and myself. If I had not read this book, I would not be as happy, as confident and strong as I am now. And my world would not be as big. I guess there might be other books of this kind that are as well written, but this book came into my life just the right time, the time that I was very weak at heart, so it had a great impact to mold my personality. I wish to read original version of the book later on.
031286504X|5.0|I was apprehensive about getting this book because of all the &quot;good&quot; reviews surrounding it.  I am somewhat skeptical of what everyone else thinks is good because I like to form my own opinions.  It's not that I go out looking for things with bad reviews, (because most of the time, they're right *grin*) just that I don't like to be overly influenced by other people.  However in this case I can assure you, the hype is all that.  All the stories in this collection are worth your while.  Some are funny, some gross, all intriguing.  I am Legend is the stand alone best though.  It reminded me of The Omega Man, a movie with Charleton Heston, or perhaps it should be other way around. . .I am not sure about the dates.  The one &quot;true&quot; man against a world of monsters.  It is fantastic, people at work kept giving me strange looks because of how obivously into the book I was.  I read it very fast, then again, it goes fast once you get past I am Legend, which takes up most of the book.  The book is set up with I am Legend which is like 126 pages or so, and the others are kind of tag alongs, they don't deal with the first story at all, in fact none of the stories are related in any way, but as I said before, each have their own flavor and I loved each one and began to respect Mr. Matheson more and more as I went on.  Check it out, if you're into horror, you don't know what you're missing.  Five worthy stars!
6302610702|1.0|Long before the Sopranos, came the soap opera epic of the Spaghettis.

1572702036|5.0|Agatha Christie's &lt;Death on the Nile&gt; first appeared as a novel in 1937, later as a play by the author, and finally as a fairly successful film with Peter Ustinov as Poirot. Now it has reached its fourth incarnation, so to speak, as an audio book from Audio Partners in which the complete text is acted out (rather than simply read) by none other than David Suchet. This British actor (who once played Inspector Japp, by the way, in one of the updated Poirot films!) has become completely associated with the role through the PBS series, which is now available from Acorn Media, and is by far the most logical choice for reader.  He quite nicely manages a new voice for each character and (no surprise) his Poirot voice is the most successful.<br />  The story is a variation of the English manor house  murder novel. A manageably small group of people is on board a ship taking an Egyptian cruise and one of the party is murdered. While almost every character has excellent motive, the one with the strongest is the only one who definitely could not have done it. The rest, of course, could have--in true Christie fashion--and two other murders take place before Poirot gets his little gray cells to see the case from a completely novel but correct angle. One device I must admit annoys me is the device of having Poirot overhear a private conversation early in the story; but here it does little harm to credibility and is just part of the fun.<br />  So we have a thumping good mystery, interesting characters, a supersleuth, and Suchet's superb reading to make this Audio Partners offering a very good choice.
B00000BKE1|4.0|Fear Of The Dark is not a bad album, or the disaster many think it is.  I think this album came off as bad because the band was wiped out from the 80's, a decade where they released 9 albums and toured constantly without a break, save for a few months.  Bruce Dickinson shows the strain of this far more than any of the band members; his powerful howl has been reduced to a raspy gruff not worthy of his name.  However, many of the songs here are great.  Be quick or be dead, afraid to shoot strangers, the title cut, judas be my guide, childhoods end, and from here to eternity are great.  Fear is the key, wasting love, the fugitive, and chains of misery are so-so tracks.  they are good enough to be Maiden, but fear is the key and chains of misery should have been b-sides.  Then FOTD would have been great.  The album is mostly ruined by its worst tracks, the apparition and weekend warrior, which are truly horrid.  They are not even worthy of being b-sides, they should have been scrapped at the start.  Of course the record company wanted more tracks, and these were forced on, ruining the album.  Ok-thats enough.  The point is Maiden fans need this but newcomers to the band should get their other albums first.
B0000025RI|5.0|From the first amazing, almost heart-exploding tunes of the pop-nuclear-device &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Something&quot; to the final, extended sounds of &quot;The Lady In My Life&quot; wich, actually, leaves you numb. And it's actually a pop-ballad!<br />And between that we have three singles in a row (Thriller/Beat It/Billie Jean), so impressive that I doubt anybody really can describe them. Not enough. Between THAT there is a smooth-swinging Paul McCartney-duo, a deep-swinging 80's popsmash &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot;, a melodic masterpiece &quot;Human Nature&quot; and a incredible tensed song, that is &quot;P.Y.T&quot;. There it is. 9 songs of pure perfection.<br />&quot;Off The Wall&quot; was, in a way, Jackson's maturing from being a child popstar, but it still was quite an un-experienced album. And in &quot;Thriller&quot; everything is right. Michael is not only knowing what he is doing a lot better, he sounds and BURNS even more than in &quot;Off The Wall&quot;. The songs are more professional, simply put; everything is perfect.<br />If you like pop-music, you shouldn't hesitate buying this album. It is truly one of the greatest. And Jackson's best.
B000002572|5.0|I own all different types of music, but this disc continues to be played in the car or home most often.  Boston's music is a great example of pure rock, with a solid sound that continued up through their &quot;Walk On&quot; disc, only slighty different as the group lost a few of their original line up of musicians. I don't agree that they were a one-hit (album) wonder.  Several songs from the &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; album, as well as &quot;Third Stage&quot; are still played today.  I highly recommend this disc. And if you have the money, pick up their other discs.  Supposedly, there is a new disc in production that should be out by the end of the year!
6304240554|2.0|...where did this film take me, as a viewer? Nowhere. When I rented &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; I expected a horror masterpiece of epic proportions; one that I would be talking about for years to come, like all of the critics whose reviews I had read, which detailed a film so violent and ahead of its time that it would deeply affect anyone who actually could stomach the film's running time. The film started out interesting enough. There was a roller coaster ride of violence that began with a police raid on a building that was infilterated by zombies. Heads exploded from shotgun shells, necks were bitten, chunks of flesh torn away from limbs... All well and good. The make-up effects looked acceptable, and I was interested in the characters. But then the film lost me. The survivors in this film head for the mall, and they attempt to seek shelter from this supposedly unstoppable force of zombies. Now, I can understand why dozens of these things coming at you would be a threat, but in this movie they look like grey people and nothing more. They plod around aimlessly and rarely seem to have any objective. We see them destroyed wholesale in all sorts of ways, but yet they never seem to illustrate any threat until they have one person cornered. I wasn't scared by them at all, yet I persevered in watching this movie because I was expecting some sort of terrifying pay off that made all of this so-called sophisticated satire and gore worthwhile. I never got it. The pay off didn't come, and I turned off the TV feeling cheated. &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; could've been something magnificent if only George Romero had bumped up the pace at which the zombies attack, shortened the movie by about twenty minutes, and didn't so blatantly try and hit us over the head with the satire stick. A little subtlety would've helped too. &quot;Dawn&quot; missed so many opportunities it could've capitalized on that, to me anyway, it's nothing more than a series of misthrown darts that struck so far away from the bull's eye you'd need an RV and a ten day supply of food and water to retrieve them. Now, I know that many people who have seen this movie think of it as a masterpiece of the genre, and how dare I sully the good name of such a good director, but I just didn't see what this movie had to offer in the entertainment category. Sure, there are some laughs and some moments of genuine tension, but they don't make up for an overlong script, stretches of silence that have no point, mediocre acting, and hundreds of grey people that do nothing more than wander up the down escalator, which is why I give the film 2 stars. Seriously, if these zombies can rip open a man's abdomen and rip his intestines out like they were tearing through plastic wrap, why can't a whole group of them break through a window? I found myself asking that question one too many times during this film. It's a true masterpiece of disappointment.o far away from the bull's eye you'd need an RV and a ten day supply of food and water to retrieve them.

B000059R8Y|4.0|Finally, the new Eric Clapton album is out. Where did the journey go after the modern sound of the Curtis Mayfield-influenced 'Pilgrim', and the bluesy, Grammy-winning collaboration with B.B. King? Well, it is a different album yet again; now one gets the combined influence of both blues and soul. In my view, it is a good album precisely because it is different again. It has some blues (Come back baby, Got you on my mind), some soul (I ain't gonna stand for it, Broken down), some instrumentals (Reptile, Son &amp; Sylvia), some rockers (Superman inside, Travelin' light), and some slow songs (Broken down, Don't let me be lonely tonight). Eric Clapton's singing and guitar playing is strong but the guitar is clearly not the focal point. He has authored or co-authored half of the songs. Not all of them are very memorable but this is partially due to the fact that he has chosen great cover songs (J.J. Cale's 'Travelin light', Stevie Wonder's 'I ain't gonna stand for it', Ray Charles' 'Come back baby', etc). The production is sometimes a bit slick at times (co-produced by Simon Climie) and a number of tracks feature electronic drums and strings. Fortunately, this does not really undermine the lively atmosphere of the session.  The overall mood of the album is very much backward looking, which is intentional, as Clapton writes in the liner notes. This has been, at least partially, achieved through the musical arrangements. The dominant voices, apart from Clapton who appears to be very much in control, are The Impressions, doing great vocal work, and the sound of an organ played by either Billy Preston, Paul Carrack, Joe Sample or Tim Carmon. The other two guitarists, his regular rhythm player Andy Fairweather Low and Doyle Bramhall II, a white blues musician from Texas, are much more in the background.  This album will neither fully appeal to the fans of Clapton's guitar playing nor those who enjoyed Pilgrim very much. However, it contains something for every one, and thiswas always the major strength of Eric Clapton during his solo years. So my prediction is: Another hit album for Eric Clapton!
0446677450|2.0|There may be some reasonable if not exceptional investment advice here, but let's face it. The folks that write this mediocre stuff for the infommercial circuit got rich when the marks started buying this stuff with wild eyed dreams of enormous wealth. Never mind that structural issues in a capitalist economy make this program unavailable to many, the suckers will buy into it out of desperation. At root this is a very cynical and dangerous book.

B000059R8Y|5.0|I didn't know Clapton released a new album until I saw a large poster of the 'Reptile' cover with the subtitle &quot;A new album by the Guitar God !!!&quot; handwritten by a Claptonphile record store employee.<br />Well, he is a guitar god. He proved it a long time ago... while Clapton endures and thrives, showing no sign of fading away, but rather reinventing himself each and every time, surprising, innovating, exciting and thrilling.<br />And 'Reptile' is no exception. Starting with a melodic instrumental piece that lends its name to the album, and continuing with a masterful set of rock, rhythm-and-blues and straight-up blues tracks, including J.J. Cale's 'Travelin' Light', 'Got you on my mind' (reminds me of the great 'From the cradle' album). Billy Preston plays excellent Piano on 'Find myself', and some of the best musicians Clapton played with in the eighties and early nineties also do a beautiful job (Andy Fairwehther-Low on guitar, Nathan East on bass).<br />The album contains everything I would have asked for from a Clapton album: some great electric guitar moments, some acoustic ones. Rock, rhythm-and-blues and blues tracks that mix in naturally with one another, great songs (both covers and originals) and a good production by Clapton and Simon Climie (whose tendency to computerize and digitize Clapton does not appear to blatantly in this album - unlike in 'Pilgrim').<br />In short - Go get it. fast.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|Any attempt at a compilation of the Beatles' best tracks (unless compiled by a deaf person) is going to (a) be a non-stop barrage of unsurpassed melody and imaginative song craftsmanship and (b) cause massive contention about what tracks should have been included. This means that many of the things a reviewer might normally say about the quality of a compilation would, with regard to this album, be either self-evident or merely a matter of opinion. Nevertheless, I hope the following remarks don't (quite) succumb to these failings. My message is this: of all the inappropriate methods of choosing what should go onto a best-of, the strategy of sticking to number one singles strikes me as downright clueless, at least in the case of the Beatles. Here is some evidence: there is not a single track from what most people consider to be their best album, Sgt Pepper's, the reason being that there were no singles, and consequently no number ones, released from it. I strongly doubt whether 'A day in the life', 'She's leaving home' or 'Lucy in the sky' from that album are worse than, say, tracks 22 and 23 and a fair slab of the early stuff with its airhead lyrics. And although 'Strawberry Fields' might have been merited inclusion, it didn't even come into contention for this compilation due to a quirk of history: it was released on the other side of the 'Penny Lane' single, and thus ran into some unfairly stiff competition.  Rather than getting bitter and twisted about all this, I will make some positive suggestions for people who are interested in gaining an initial acquaintance with the Beatles' output. If you only want to buy one album, then this compilation would probably be the best choice, despite the above criticism. If you find that you like their stuff, you can always get Sgt Peppers without doubling up on any tracks.  If you have the funds, it would be better to go for the older four-disc best-of comprising 1967-1970 (The Blue Album) and 1962-1966 (The Red Album). Herethe order reflects my bias towards late Beatles, but beware that other fans dig the earlier work more -a fact which reduces my faith in humanity less than the song selections on the album under review did.
0440219078|5.0|I have just finished reading 'THE GIVER'. And I think, in general, that books with open ends are the best. When I read the first three chapters I wasn't very eager to read this book until its end. But I had to (because it was part of our English lessons). I would have missed reading a fascinating book if I didn't read it. From chapter 7 on, I think, I began to like this book because the community had a so different way of life. There is 'Sameness' allover the community, but one little Eleven has the opportunity to change it, to change his robot-life into a real life worth living. A life full of colors, feelings and nature. With his will he'll achieve his aim. He'll achieve a different life for him and the 'newchild' Gabriel, using the memories he got from The Giver. But HOW he achieves his aim is let by the reader's fantasy.  PS: I apologize for my mistakes. I'm just a 16-year-old student from Germany... ;-)

And by the way, if you think any of this alblum sounds like the beatles, keep this in mind:  this alblum was recorded at abbey road while the beatles were recording an alblum (possibly abbey road, but im not sure)

B0000584V3|5.0|I'd much rather not give this recording a star rating, being that I've only had it for half a week and I've only listened to it a few times. They really have moved away from their old style. That being the creepy yet beautiful two part lead guitar harmonies, the mid-range resonant rasp that was so &quot;Undivine&quot; and appealing, and the fluid transition between passages. Now, things are different, we have sudden jolting transitions between the delicate and the brutal, we have big heavy sprawling chords, and insane riffing that is at times dis-chordant as opposed to melodic. The death rasp has become a sort of cheesy, low-end rumble-rasp like something you'd hear on an 80's Death Metal album. Over all, their sounding more and more like In Flames with every recording. Never-the-less, this recording has so many things going for it. Firstly, Akerfeld's (did I spell his name right?) excellent clean vocals keep getting better and better, and more abundant at that. I love the use of swedish folk music as well. Despite the fact that &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; and, say, &quot;Orchid&quot; sound like they were recorded by two entirely different bands, I find myself listening to &quot;New Opeth&quot; nearly as much as I do &quot;Old&quot; or &quot;Classic Opeth&quot;. No matter how you look at it, this band is absolutely incredible. Including all genres of rock and progressive music, they really are one of the most talented bands around today. Even my mother agrees. It was pretty funny actually...I was back for the weekend from college, and I was playing the acoustic passage from &quot;The Twilight is my Robe&quot; on the guitar when my mom says &quot;Wow, that's so beautiful, did you write that?&quot;. I laughed as said &quot;I wish, it's actually by Opeth&quot;. I laugh even more when I saw the look of disgust on her face. She absolutely hates death metal and can't find any redeeming quality in it. Despite this, even she admits that Opeth is an unusually talented band.
B000059R8Y|5.0|This is incredible.  Eric Clapton seems to get better and better with every album.  He is never a disappointment.
B000059R8Y|5.0|Thank you Mr. Clapton for this beautiful album. This work of art is a perfect recording from start to finish. The entire album is a graceful composition of intricate instrumental voicings, warm background harmony vocals, and a most captivating E.C. voice. The guitar-work is ( as is to be expected from such a master) sublime to say the least. Mr. Clapton's vocals on this record are superb, especially his compelling blues voice on songs such as &quot;Come Back Baby&quot;,indeed a reflection of his deep-rooted love for the blues. The songs are diversified and the arrangements well balanced. The tonal quality of this recording is impeccable. This album is a polished shining gem and bears the signature of a  truely gifted professional. I am certain this recording will undoubtably attain the status of &quot;Album of the Year&quot;. Congratulations Mr. Clapton!!

It depicts, in Rands words, &quot;man as he could and ought to be.&quot;  Anyone who adheres to the pronciples of personal autonomy and responsibility, should read this book.  It is an encouragement, and it changed my view of the world around me.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I could write pages after pages about this masterpeace,but what I want to share is not on the materiel level, but it comes from deep inside my sole. This move gave me the best feeling I had in years. It has everythig that could possible  make me want to turn back time and become a rock star. The film made me walk in to LP stores again,looking for records of lost times. The film made me cry,smile,scream of happyness and call my best friends to make them go see the film and get the same groovy feeling I got at the time.<br />It works on so many levels,but I enjoied it mostly becouse it rocked. Like the same god feeling I got after seeng,Val Kimler portraying Jim Morrison in The Doors. It gets all my five stars because of the realety level,I almoust thougt I was there.I felt the fame,the heartace,the love...just everything.<br />I recomend this movie to everybody that has lost faith in ever succeding.
B000059MEK|5.0|It was the moment for which I had waited 2 years, and the one for which many others had waited 4. I gleefully obtained my copy of Daft Punk's &quot;Discovery&quot;, released today. And indeed, the album did give much to discover. There was no earlier European or Japanese release. Only one single from the album had been available, and I resisted the urge to purchase it. Untainted from influence and not knowing what to expect, I open the jewel case. Inside, I discover it is one of those double CD cases. I eagerly flip the tray to discover... a membership card to the Daft Club. Never announced before, there is a veritable smorgasbord of wonderful downloads to purchasers of the album, and for nobody else. I am happy and sad, because you are only allowed to install the software on one machine and I am away from my home PC right now.<br />Anyway, the music itself is incredible. It is a bit different from the simple yet perfect disco beats of &quot;Homework&quot;, and everything is a bit more energetic. Less repetitive as well, and even some digitized classical harp and soothing synth is thrown in on occasion. And now there are... vocals. In that wanky Cher/Eiffel 65 robotic voice no less. And in English mind you, by French people. So, you get Eiffel 65-ish sounding voices singing lyrics such as the following from &quot;Digital Love&quot;:<br />Ooh I don't know what to do About this dream and you I wish the dream comes true<br />Ooh I don't know what to do About this dream and you We'll make the dream come true<br />Why don't you play the game? Why don't you play the game?<br />Not so profound. The backing track would have been so much better without the mushy shit, in my opinion. It reminds me of the video game Sonic R, where the music and vocals were fabulous but the crappy English translated lyrics made the music laughable. Knowing the comic reputation of the two synthsmiths, I'd like to think that is the case.<br />All in all, an amazing album. There is no &quot;Da Funk&quot; or &quot;Around the World&quot; hit this time though. Just an album chock full of eardrum thumping goodness. Do yourself a major favor by buying this CD!
1878424319|5.0|Mystics have long asserted that we live our lives in a fog of confusion, and that great freedom lies in store for those who learn to see through the fog and differentiate between fantasy and reality.  Author Don Miguel Ruiz presents us with four simple concepts from ancient Toltec wisdom which can free us from illusion in his elegant book, THE FOUR AGREEMENTS:  be impeccable with your word, don't take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and always do your best.<br />Ruiz explains how the very beliefs we are raised with usually get in our way of being who we truly are, and helps us learn to master our emotions so we may better navigate our way through the twists and turns of our lives.  The four agreements illustrate better ways to relate to others with genuine love and compassion, while not sacrificing our integrity to ourselves and our spirit in the process.<br />Deceptively simple to read, this book has sufficient depth and power to inspire us to become the masters of our destiny, courageously living each day to the fullest, free from fear of being judged or victimized.  I agree with Ruiz that all who implement these four agreements will live a life of Heaven on Earth... and I am awed that such a small book can deliver so much.

0790743132|5.0|What is there that a reviewer can say about \\"Casablanca\\" which is new? Surely just about everyone has now seen this film and everybody knows the plot which is set during World War Two at a night club owned by American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) in Casablanca frequented by many dubious characters of all nationalities. Just to complicate matters in walks Ilsa Lund Laszlo (Ingrid Bergman), his ex lover from years before who had abandoned him. She is now married to resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) on the run from the Germans. Bogart can help by supplying them with the vital transit papers they desperately need to escape to America but is he willing to do that when his policy has always been \\"I stick my neck out for nobody\\"?<br /><br />One of the great Warner Bros. films of the forties - possibly the most productive decade in the history of Hollywood .... and how about all those \\"classic lines\\"? It is very unlikely that any other movie contained as many quotable lines as can be found in \\"Casablanca\\".<br /><br />Here are just a few of my many favourite lines from the film:<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart: \\"Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine\\".<br /><br />Ingrid Bergman: \\"Play it Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By'.\\"<br /><br />Bogart: \\"You played it for her, you can play it for me .... if she can stand it, I can. Play it\\".<br /><br />Bogart: \\"Here's looking at you, kid\\".<br /><br />Bogart: \\"The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world\\".<br /><br />Claude Rains: \\"Major Strasser has been shot. Round up all the usual suspects\\".<br /><br />Bogart: \\"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\".<br /><br />The film is worth seeing over and over again just to hear Bogart uttering those unforgettable lines in his inimitable style. And of course to enjoy that celebrated song by Dooley Wilson - \\"As Time Goes By\\". Incredibly it has been reported that Dooley Wilson was a singer but NOT a pianist so his playing was done by another musician.<br /><br />\\"Casablanca\\" featured one of those all star casts that only come along once in a lifetime - Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.Z. Sakall, and Dooley Wilson. (It has been claimed that the first choice of leading players was to have been Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan but if this proposed casting  is correct and had gone ahead I doubt if the film would have received the cult following it has today!).<br /><br />\\"Casablanca\\" won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Michael Curtiz) and Best Screenplay (Julius and Philip Epstein). It also had nominations for Best Actor (Bogart), Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Score. Humphrey Bogart didn't receive the award for Best Actor but he was recognised some years later when he won the Best Actor Award for \\"The African Queen\\".

0812548094|2.0|I continue to look for a book to rival the writing and sophistication of Tolkein and Herbert, but this book doesn't cut it. Goodkind has many similarities to Jordan, both in story line and in the ability to run on for thousands of pages. The characters are good ones, but the book has a propensity to edge towards a romance novel. What really killed it for me, however, was how Goodkind built up several story threads and then proceeded to end the novel with an abrupt godlike intervention of magic that solves all the problems. It was simply too childlike -- make your moral decisions and then your subconscious will take care of the rest. It's as if the author and editor said &quot;Oops, we've hit a thousand pages... better wrap this up quick and focus on the next one.&quot; That's all fine and good, but why kill a book that has some good moments with a simplistic deus ex machina ending? The first book, with the dark edge of the Mord Sith challenge, was more interesting for anyone over 14.

B00000K0DT|5.0|I sat on the edge of my seat, gazing at the screen.  Completely glued.  As the end came barreling in, I was shocked by the complexity of the story line.  By the ending, everything made sense.  All through the next day, I reviewed the plot over in my mind.  I went out and rented it again.  By the end of the second viewing,  a curtain opened, and I almost laughed at the simplicity.  If only this genious writer had continued in The Way Of The Gun, it would have been a blockbuster.  I highly recommend my favorite movie to anyone.

0618001905|3.0|I bought this book because I had heard its author interviewed on NPR some time ago, and the story Hochschild had to tell about the  exploitation of the Congo and its people by Europe generally and King Leopold specifically sounded facinating.  And, in fact, I'm glad that I read this book because it has informed me about a genocide of which I had known very little.  However, unlike most of the reviewers here, I thought that the book was fairly flawed in a few key respects.  First, I didn't find it to be particularly well written or edited.  More significant, however, is the fact that -- in what I assume was an effort to make the subject more accessible -- the author repeatedly attempts to psychoanalyze many of the key actors on the basis of both very little information and twenty-first century views of psychology and human behavior.  Hochschild's depiction of Stanley is one of many examples:  I would have preferred less unsupported speculation about the impact that the absence of a father had on Stanley's personality development, and more on what Stanley actually did.  Moreover, I often felt that the psychological assessments were very poorly wrought -- reading like implausible carricatures of various historical actors and, unfortuantely, minimizing the role played by the larger colonial culture in the perpetuation of racism and exploitation.  <br />As I said, though, I'm glad I read the book and know (to some degree) what happened in the Congo.
6305558167|5.0|I just adore this movie. <br />First, its beautiful to watch. The costuming and scenery are simply breathtaking.<br />Secondly, the music works so well with it. Music from Wagner's Ring Cycle, and Orff's (?) Carmina Burrana serve the story well.<br />Third, it does a pretty good job of covering the entire  Arthurian legend in just over a couple of hours. <br />There are flaws: the armor, while beautiful, is ridiculously unrealistic; no one ever wore armor like that except for modern costume parties. And there are some very gory scenes. <br />All in all, though, I give this my highest recommendation.
B000008H1U|4.0|In my opinion 5 stars are too much. I belong to those who think, that Tull was at its best in the 70s. After the failure &quot;Under Wraps&quot;, i lost my interest in the band. I was wrong, because Tull have'nt said its final words yet, but still, &quot;Crest of a knave&quot; is not one of Tull's best. Let me mark &quot;Mountain Man&quot; and &quot;The waking edge&quot;, that remind me sometimes the spirit of Peter Hammill. &quot;Farm on a freeway&quot; gives us a wonderful guitar-flute duet, while &quot;Steel monkey&quot; is a great jumpy rock song. The rest are'nt bad, but not too &quot;wowy&quot;.  The album gained the Grammy for the best hard rock album in 1987, but is it really a hard rock? Since the end of the golden years of Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin in the mid 70s, hard rock went down, and today is recognized with limited-[...]-undeveloped music. We all know, that Anderson can rock it hard, while using Barre's cold-calculated-sharp hard sound guitar (&quot;Locomotive breath&quot;, &quot;Hunting girl&quot;, &quot;Hymn 43&quot;, and many more), but it was'nt his musical direction, and their closest album to what we use to call hard rock was &quot;A&quot;, in 1981. So... is &quot;Crest of a knave&quot; a hard rock album? No. It's just a good one.
6305308659|3.0|Perhaps the joke about &quot;not remembering the 60's&quot; is true, as no one else seems to have noticed that this film is a deft and concise summary of the events of the late 50's and 60's.<br />The way that conservatives describe the 50's and 60's show that they don't really understand what happened.<br />As clearly depicted in this film, the 50's had their values straight, BUT no one knew why!  The extreme events preceding the 50's - the two world wars, the depression, and the subsequent cold war - all required conformity purely for survival.   When you are at war, anyone who is &quot;different&quot; is a potential traitor.  The cold war perpetuated this state of events, because it prevented society from returning to a normal peacetime where there could be individual freedom.<br />This meant that traditional values and ways were never explained, and reasons were not given.  The children who grew up in this militaristic peacetime (&quot;boomers&quot;) were not given reasons for any of the rules and rigid ways of doing just about everything.<br />Pleasantville clearly depicts this - the guy must give the girl a &quot;pin&quot; at a certain point in the relationship, people had to wear certain clothes and not other clothes, and on and on.  I remember all of this rigidity.<br />The result was the explosive rebellion of the late 50's and 60's.  Since no reasons were given for traditional values and ways of doing things, the result was - just as in the movie - that everything possible was tried, and relativism was born - &quot;every idea is just as good as any other idea&quot;.   Those of us who had some sense (and who actually did try everything) came to realize through experience why the traditional values were created in the first place.   Others are still out to sea about all this - as evidenced by amazing comments in the customer reviews on this site, like the one that says &quot;sometimes adultery can be just as good as fidelity&quot; - the rationalizations themind can make are incredible - can you imagine that person saying &quot;sometimes robbery can be just as good as generosity&quot; or  \\"sometimes racism can be just as good as tolerance\\"?  I don't think so.<br />So, in the 50's and 60's, the young discovered art and literature primarily outside of the traditional system, since the rigid conformity of the times did not allow any freedom of expression or thought - which are essential for art and literature.   This is depicted in the film, even the most famous of 60's rebellion novels, \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", is included. But, in the 60's and in Pleasantville, with no traditional value system, the \\"baby was thrown out with the bathwater\\" and self-destructive behaviors crept in along with the joy and freedom.   Responsibility and altruism were casualties of the rush to self-exploration.<br />The reaction of those in authority in the 60's clearly indicates that they themselves did not understand the reasons behind traditional values, as evidenced by grim condemnation being their only reaction to events.   Small wonder that they did not properly explain things to begin with, when they themselves did not understand them.  All this is depicted in Pleasantville.  Even the civil rights movement is present in miniature, complete with the reasons why it was so attractive to the \\"boomers\\" to begin with.<br />So, in the film, and in the 60's, we have a rigid and conformist society that explains nothing about its core values (in the film, only trivia is taught in class).  When the young, who are not set in their ways, explore freedom and creativity, they do so in a vacuum, because their society cannot give them any guidance and meaning.   The result is the whole string of problems mentioned in the beginning of the film - divorce, alienation, crime, and emptiness.   But since the filmmaker - like the boomers in the 60's and the young people of Pleasantville - has still never understood the reasons behind traditional values, his only possible statement is that the changes were for the best, since the only alternative for him is the rigid conformity of the original Pleasantville.<br />Note that the authorities in charge of Pleasantville cannot give any good reasons in favor of their point of view, and have no commentary about the changes other than condemnation.   This parallels the general distaste in our current society for anyone who claims to have answers - because it is assumed that those answers are simply calls for rigid conformity and unquestioning obedience.<br />So, despite the apparent existentialist purpose behind the film, nevertheless viewing the film can be very valuable to conservatives in seeing why the 60's happened the way they did, and why the participants felt they were right (and righteous) to do what they did.  And most importantly, it shows that - for the last 40-50 years, what has been most missing in our society is clear explanations of the reasons behind traditional \\"family\\" values.<br />Unfortunately, it may be too late - only because there may no longer be any venue in which this explanation can take place, as neither the media nor the educational system would allow such explanations that threaten their self-serving point of view.
B00000IPAX|4.0|All over the US, traditional punk fans have been saying that Blink 182 sold out. The truth is that,yes, they did go on MTV and wrote a couple of corny songs like all the small things. That's no way to judge music. Blink 182 is still the same rebellious punk rock band that they've always been except for the fact that they made a couple extra bucks along the way. The fact that they have a sense of humor pays off for everything. All the samll things was a stupid song but they payed off by making a halarious music video that made fun of pop. But the whole album is packed with great music and the lyrics to go with it. They don't have to act sophisticated or write songs that nobody understands or talk in pretentious poetry the way some bands like Eve 6 do. They talk about what they know and add humor to their everyday experiences.  The guitar and punk beat on this album is well put together without lots of intentional distortion or messy guitar playing the way some punk bands these days earn their respect. Both Tom Delounge and Mark Hoppus are good singers; Tom doing the harder and faster songs like dynastary gary and Mark doing the less hard core songs like what's my age again? This definatly isn't Blink 182's best album but it definately shows potential. All songs on this CD are pretty good except Wendy Clear. My favs are #1,#5,#6,#7,#9,#12. Their Anthem is probably the best song on the album. If you don't own anything of blink 182's get Dude ranch first.
B000056K04|4.0|This is a really really good record. Unfortunately it suffers from the heavy hand of producer Glen Ballard. While there is some great material on it, by focusing so much on songs, the band itself - arguably one of the greatest live ensembles peforming today - are reduced to the role of sidemen. Although Dave's lyrics and melodies are clever and bouyant as ever, without the creative input of the band (particularly drummer Carter Beauford)this album almost seems like a Dave Matthews solo album.  Interestingly Dave and the band address this issue in their Rolling Stone cover story. Apparently they approached this record like all of their past records with producer Steve Lillywhite, same studio, etc. They came up with some good music, but they were unhappy with the results. The band apparently loves this new record with Ballard and maybe for them it is more important to show their songwriting chops. But for me, I really miss the band interaction and deep grooves of the past. Just don't miss the live show!

I totally recommend this album, buy it. Then start saving up because you'll have the urge to purchase everything these guys have ever released!

0684874350|5.0|I am always leary of books showered with awards and praise. In this case, it is not just well deserved but I must add my own. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It works on every level. Interestingly, the book starts off almost with a dare. A kind of you think you had it rough growing up? Mr McCourt then uses the language of a child to describe his childhood in the slums of Limerick, Ireland among the poorest of the poor. Without a hint of self-pity he describes in crystal clear detail the sights, sounds, and smells of heartbreaking poverty. But with every sadness, there is laughter. Sometimes he seems to be revealing another layer of the human condition on every page. His compassion, his chicanery, and his remarkable use of the English language make you feel as though you are reading not just a fresh novel, but an entirely new insight on life. Missing your morning meeting, getting a flat, etc. will forever be placed in their true perspective.  This book is what literature is all about.

Most of the tracks are under 4 minutes, which means they don't drag on.  The long wait for this album ..., but you gotta pick it up.  It's easily going to be a classic right next to Homework.  ....  Go buy the album already.

For that same reason, it is a film that takes a few viewings to really appreciate. The first time I saw it I was a little overwhelmed with all the information, especially the fast-paced dialogue. I probably missed 10% of what was said.  My second viewing was sheer joy, my third....you get the idea.<br />The only negative aspect of this movie is that near the end there is an incredibly violent scene (both psychological and graphic) in Caspar's office that is too 'over-the-top'for my taste.  I've gotten over it, but friends who've seen it have also complained about this scene.  <br />...So the film is only 99.8% perfect.
0375703764|3.0|'House of Leaves' is straightahead psychological horror tricked out with a deal of postmodern gadgetry. The story is about 'the house': a reified form of personal psychology which literally enables people's fears to take physical form. This is not a new idea - Stanislav Lem's 'Solaris' got there first (and much more impressively) - and is not done in any way which either scared me silly me or gave me much pause for deep reflection. That said, the story, when you get past the everywhichway typography, endless footnotes, and faux-academic diversions (which can be skipped) does crack along nicely. The question the book really raises is, why not just drop the pretentious stuff and get on and TELL that story? In Umberto Eco's 'The Name of the Rose' (the book 'Leaves' constantly invites comparison with), there is a good reason for featuring multiperspectival takes on the same content. Using different discourses - narrative, philosophy, aesthetics, forensics - helps us get new leverage on what's going on: the shunts between these discourses serve a purpose which is not just explanatory, but also invites ways to excitingly reconceptualise what 'entertainment' can be. However, in contrast, Danielewski's various postmodern devices just do not work - either in terms of providing fresh insights, or suggesting a new form of art. The multivocality, archives of letters, parallel storylines, pictures, 'concrete writing', and so on, don't shed much new light on what is relatively straightforward content, because they don't need to. The devices (among these, see-through pages and upside down footnotes are notable) end up at best redundant and at worst plain annoying. That said, 'House of Leaves' is not as bad as some people have suggested. It's an entertaining tale with good characterisation and a nice central idea - but definitely NOT an intellectual behemoth. For my money, it's enjoyable and worth a speed-read, but for the real postmodern thriller/horror deal, go to 'The Name of the Rose'.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie was amazing.. It had some weak points in the plot and maybe some scenes that could have been cut with no effect on the movie.. I recently purchased a DVD player/ this movie on DVD. Having seen it originally on VHS, I look forward to seeing it in the cleaner, sharper picture that DVD offers. The direction was excellent, and several of the scenes were (for a lack of a better term) really COOL.  What most people don't realise is that you have to suspend belief somethimes to truely enjoy a movie. If you don't, you'll spend so much time nit picking through the movie, you'll never get to enjoy what you paid for.  After all, how many of the &quot;beloved classics&quot; have scenes in them that seem a bit far fetched? (A being picked up by a tornado and dropped on a Wicked Witch in Munchin Land?) In cocnlusion- good movie. If you have a DVD player, buy it. If not, get the VHS cuz' it's worth it.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Like all of Hitchcock's films, 'Rear Window' examines the duality of nature. To be more particular, the thrill and guilt of voyeurism. Sidelined by an accident and confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg, photographer James Stewart sits in his sweltering apartment with nothing more to do then look out his window. The simple hobby soon becomes an obsession when he grows to believe that one of his neighbors, a costume jewelry salesman played by Raymond Burr, has killed his wife. Hitchcock's amazing ability to craft suspense sequences figures in what can only be described as a nailbiting finale. This is very much a movie about moviegoing. Each of the occupants in the apartments Stewart watches has it's own story: Ms. Torso, the beautiful ballet dancer seen entertaining numerous men, Ms. Lonely Heart, who dresses up and waits for someone to come to her door, and a struggling songwriter who, right before our very eyes and ears, composes a song that ultimately becomes the very theme of the movie. We see Stewart watching these people, followed by his reaction. Thus is the essense of moviegoing. When his girlfriend (a radiant Grace Kelly) makes her way to Burr's apartment in search of evidence, Burr suddenly comes back. Stewart watches the volitile situation from his chair, unable to intervene, just watch. It's simply brilliant, made at a time when Hitchcock's powers were at their peak. Any person who enjoys film both as art and entertainment needs to see this film. The DVD edition is beautiful, the sound incredible. This is a film where the soundtrack is of utmost importance since the only sounds we hear are the sound from outside Stewart's window (whenever there is music playing on the film's soundtrack, it is coming from a neighbor's apartment, etc.). The making of documentary is fascinating viewing as is the production gallery, both giving us some rare insight into the master of suspense. This is a true classic of cinema and a must-own DVD.
B000002JB8|5.0|Very surpricing and remarcable work of Vangelis.I like this style of music  and this sounds breengs you real ocean feelings.Most of the tracks are calm and gentle but serious ode to the Oceans.I like this album very much also because it contains many sounds of waves who relaxing you any time of the day,or year
B00003W8NM|5.0|David Fincher definitely has guts. Not since 'Death Wish' have I seen a movie that celebrates it's brutality so much. But no matter. What 'Fight Club' lacks in compassion it more then makes up for in humor and style. Fincher's direction is near-perfect, shadowy and smooth-flowing camera work highlights every scene. It is a film director's dream come true. The story is a bit strange, to say the least. It's the story of two men: Edward Norton, an insomniac so disillusioned and removed from life that he has to attend support-group meeting in order to feel anything at all. And Brad Pitt, a seemingly unhinged, yet extremely charismatic soap salesman with ego and machismo to burn. The two men meet after Norton's highrise apartment... uh... explodes. They are perfect counterparts, one out of touch with his own manhood, the other a man who wallows in it. They start up an underground boxing club called 'fight club' where men come and beat each other up, apparently to release their frustration and get back in touch with what makes them men in the first place (which I guess is brutality or stupidity, I can't decide which). Everything is going fine until a woman named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter, sexy and snake-like) makes her way into their lives, sparking a bizarre chain of events that leads to terrorism and chaos. The story, from a book by Chuck Palahniuk, is twisted and convoluted, never really making sense until the end where we receive a final plot twist that is so pointless it's revolutionary. But the fine points of the plot never really matter. The only thing that matters is what we're watching on the screen before us at the time. Like a train wreck, the film is dark and repulsive, but we can't turn our eyes away. The bloody fist-fights come to startlingly vivid life on DVD, each thud of a fist hitting skin rockets through us. We squirm and we shudder, but we're fascinated. The movie might not be full of meaning but it is nonetheless remarkable. The performances are alltop-notch, especially Meat Loaf in a supporting role as Bob who, due to treatments for testicular cancer, has grown rather large breasts.  The twisted sense of humor of writer Jim Uhls and the fluid, breathtaking direction of David Fincher makes this film more like a rollercoaster then an endurence test. You're retching but laughing all the while. The DVD is AMAZING!!! Four commentary tracks from the cast and director, dozens of behind-the-scenes featurettes, trailers, photo galleries, deleted scene... literally days worth of extras are packed onto the two discs. There hasn't been a better reason to own a DVD player yet.
B000059XYL|5.0|I LOVED this movie!!  It was so sweet and sexy at the same time.  The music and the moves were great!  I especially loved Piper Perabo for this part!
B00003CX8J|4.0|Bryan Singer was not my first choice to direct this film. I thought maybe Sam Raimi or Alex Proyas, someone who was a bit more VISUAL a director. Don't get me wrong here, Singer's debut film 'The Usual Suspects' still ranks as one of my favorite films of all time, but it so much different then adapting one of the most beloved and revered comic books of all time. But in the end Singer turned out to be the perfect choice. Why? His attention to characters. The X-Men, from it's earliest days, has always been a comic driven and defined by it's attention to character development, not just explosions and chaos. What Singer does here is miraculous. He takes a group of unbelievable characters and turns them into easily identifiable people, people who you might actually believe existed. The talented group of players lucky enough to play the roles in the film are uniformly fine. Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor Xavier, Famke Janssen is touching and alluring as Jean Grey, and Hugh Jackman (in a superb out-of-nowhere performance) brings humanity and lonliness to the imposing visage of Wolverine. The film also marks a bold departure from other films of it's kind in one more crucial area: special effects. Too many times the effects ARE the film, they are what holds our interest and define our excitement. While X-Men is by no means short on effects, the effects ENHANCE the characters instead of BEING the characters. These are people with gifts, we focus on them and not their abilities. The story is common-place comic book drivel, the good guys are out to stop the bad guys, blah blah blah... but it all hold together because of the intelligent and sometimes touching script. It's actually thought-provoking at times, a fact that makes me wonder why every other comic adaptation can not muster a single brain cell half the time. It is a fabulous achievement, a film that should not have succeeded but does because of a great script, wonderful performances, and assured direction from a man who is clearly out of his game. The DVD edition of X-Men is unique in one way as well: it's deleted scene can be viewed separately or pieced back into the film via a special 'branching' version of the film. It is clever and important. Many times I have watched the deleted scenes included in DVDs and been completely unable to get any impact from them whatsoever because they were being viewed out of context. This 'branching' feature marks a new standard and precedent that i hope many other DVDs will live up to. The picture quality is crisp and the sound is vibrant. No commentary track however (bummer) but it also house a few easter-eggs that a few people will stumble upon. A great package for a great film.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|First off, in response to the guy from Garland, Texas who gave this CD a 1 star rating, you have absolutely no idea what good music is. This is one of the best CDs of the year and it has nothing but great, original songs. Rage has done it again! Well worth the money.
B000059R8Y|5.0|Look at his last five albums - You've got Riding with the King, Pilgrim, From the Cradle, Unplugged, 24 Nights and Journeyman.  Every one sounds quite different, and each contains moments of greatness, and yet they don't betray the artist.  Reptile is the same way.  It's unique in its own way, and yet it brings back images of E.C.'s music from Pilgrim back to 461 Ocean Blvd.  That's what is so cool about Eric Clapton.  He is obviously comfortable with certain types of music - even in this album there are blues standards, and slow acoustic numbers - yet he manages to not be stale and moldy, so that it doesn't sound like the same old stuff.  Although this album isn't as ambitious as Pilgrim's hip hop stylings, or as traditional as From the Cradle or Riding with the King, it's still comfortable and an easy listen.  Buy it!
B0000028UK|5.0|I dare say, this is Pearl Jam's best album.  From start to finish, there isn't a weak link... then again, are there any weak links in any of their albums?  Vs. shows the diverse side of Pearl Jam, not just the hard rocking anthems of Ten, but more in depth lyrics.  This is one of those best of both worlds albums, great lyrics and awesome guitar playing.  The album starts off with Go, a very good opener for any album, and starts it out on the right foot.  Go goes directly into Animal, one of my favorate Pearl Jam rockers.  Daughter, possibly Pearl Jam's most played song on the radio near me, has Eddie giving a great vocal performance with the rest of the band playing sublimely.  I love Dissadent, one of my favorate songs, it has great guitar riffs and passion in Ed's voice.  One thing I still don't understand is why Blood gets such bad press in these reviews.  I love that song.  It's perfect to blast when in a bad mood!  Just try it, scream with Eddie!  It's a good stress reliever!  Elderly Woman Behind The Counter in a Small Town is a great acoustic ballad.  Even my english teacher who doesn't like any band that's either from after 1970 or not folk likes that song.  It's a perfect singalong in live recordings.  Another underrated song on this CD is Leash.  Ok, enough of my rambling, if you don't believe me that this CD is incredible, then go out and buy it!  If you don't like it, then you don't like it, nothing I can say or do to change that, but Vs. is deffinatly a great rock album, and ranks amungst the top albums in my collection.
B00000JBCP|5.0|I am a fan of Mana since 1993.... Sergio Vallin...is very talented and he has the ability to blend different styles to Mana's rock calypso.  He can play any style from rock, salsa, jazz, reggae, punk, rancheras, banda and even cumbias and make them sound like an eternal experience.  I definetly give 5 Stars to this Album.  Mana is latin rock's Led Zepplin of the new millenium.

0451167716|5.0|Mario Puzo -IMO- was one of the best storytellers out there in the history of the printed word.  His stories are concise but informative and his characters are well developed.  Even the bit players in the supporting cast of this novel have a story that makes the reader care about them.  I was particularly interested in the character development of Lucy Mancini -who- if you recall -in the film version-  was a peripheral character that Sonny Corleone boffed on the side.  The book supplied Lucy with a background and another boyfriend following Sonny's untimely demise as well a rather interesting peculiarity which I won't divulge here.  <br />There is also better insight into Johnny Fontane's character.  Although well developed in the flick, the novel does a much better job of giving depth to Fontane's life &amp; career.  <br />If you enjoyed the movie by the same name then read this book. You won't be sorry.
0375703764|3.0|It was an interesting concept, I thought to myself as I started getting into &quot;House Of Leaves&quot;. The idea that sections of a house could actually alter their appearance; just to open a closet door, and have its hallways go on and on and on... It wasn't totally original, but still interesting and done well. After Karen and Navy first move in, and he notices how the inside of the house somehow mysteriously measures to be a fraction of an inch longer than the exterior,.. this was sort of priceless.  The ways in which the author would describe the happenings within the ever-growing hallways and staircases was well thought out.<br />The footnotes have a tendency to drive you nuts. It's not too often that a fictitious novel has just as many or more footnotes (that are a story in themselves) than the actual book.  Most of them can either be glanced at or skipped altogether. But, you do always have the feeling that something important was being overlooked. And, the ever-changing altered print was hilarious to say the least. I know that Danielewski did this to express and play along with the books subject matter, but it was sheer lunacy.<br />No doubt, Mark Danielewski put an awful lot of time and effort into this novel. You can't take that from him. It can be a lot of fun if you're in the mood for it. The reader can't help but feel the devastation present as Navy uses his last match used for light inside the maze; as he begins to burn the book he's reading right up to his fingers, just so he can finish seeing what he's reading. Then, as it finally burns out, leaving him lost in eternal darkness,... Well,.. read it and form your own opinion. But beware,.. it's as crazy as the house.<br />This book is insane.
B000003S0P|4.0|I was caught totally off guard here. Had never heard Crimson before, I only admired John Wetton for his work in Asia ( a cheesy band, but Wetton vocals are amazing ). So, I went to buy a CD from Crimson. After some reasearch and hearing some opinions, I was convinced that &quot;RED&quot; was one of their best. I can't say if it is or not, but it's good. Impressible good! A journey into progressive music at his best. I'll never forget the firsdt impression I felt while listening to it for the first time, 26 years after it was released.
B00003CXE6|5.0|My brother, who majored in ancient history, and I, a Latin and Greek major, saw this film last summer.  We talked about it for at least three hours afterwards, both because of its &quot;Shakespearean&quot; story and because of the extraordinary amount of correct detail in the film. We were particularly struck by the opening scene, which looked exactly as we had both pictured Tacitus's account of Germania. There are many, many excellences in the details, the story and the acting, so many, in fact, that one is left simply to say &quot;Thank God classical films can be made.&quot;
B00000BKDW|5.0|Iron Maiden is one of the best metal bands of all time - forget what VH1 says - and this is the reason why.  Every song is a killer.  The music is intellegent, the lyrics insightful.  And they were the best band at taking literature and transforming it into a Power Ballad.  'Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner' is almost as long as the actual poem and that is a feat in itself.  Don't be a metal dolt, buy this album.
B00005614M|5.0|About two years ago, Capitol Jazz released The Complete Birth of the Cool. At that time, it was the definitive version of an album that has been hailed as one of the true greats in the jazz pantheon. The sound quality was better than any previous release, and the booklet was chock full of informative essays, photos, etc. What no one knew at the time was that the original master tapes had been sitting in the vault, untouched. <br />When Rudy Van Gelder went to prepare a new edition of the album for Japanese release, he discovered the original session reels. As you can imagine, the difference in sound quality is astonishing. As producer Michael Cuscuna explains, &quot;This was the first time that Rudy had worked on these particular recordings, and he was surprised to find that every version subsequent to the original LP had used the 1957 12-inch master. But the original master tapes of each performance still existed, and they revealed significant improvements in sound.&quot;<br />Blue Note's Tom Evered added, \\"To set the record straight, we would not have issued the Birth of the Cool RVG if Rudy had not found the session tapes. We were not eager to issue a third edition of the BOTC but we felt we had to given the improved sound.\\" Anyone familiar with the album prior to this new release will notice the difference in sound immediately. It's much more vivid and full, allowing you to fully appreciate the complexity of the nonet's arrangements. It's like you're hearing the music for the first time. <br />This brings us to the all-important question: which one do you buy? The answer is simple--both. The booklets in both are excellent (with different material in each). The sound quality on The Complete Birth of the Cool isn't as good (although it's definitely not bad), but it contains all of the available live tracks from the group's performances at The Royal Roost. The RVG version doesn't have the live tracks, but it has better sound. The choice is yours. Whichever you decide, The Complete Birth of the Cool is an essential part of any jazz collection.
B0000524E5|3.0|If you're looking for a film that's smart AND sexy, this isn't it. However, if you just want to relax and fill your mind with a couple of hours of loud music, a gooey romance, and a &quot;dreams finally fulfilled&quot; kind of story, this is the right movie.  The women dance hard, the boy is cute (and one of the founders of the group Tap Dogs), and the songs Violet writes are a little too sappy to be pop.  Playing the 'new girl' Piper Perabo turns in a believable performance as the wide-eyed hopeful in the big bad city.  However, it was always a little too convenient that everytime she or those around her get in hot water, she always saves the day.  The supporting cast of women are indeed bad girls punching guys and mouthing off whenever possible.  The features on the DVD are actaully pretty inventive.  So by all means buy the movie if you're gonna need something thoughtless to get through an all nighter or a slow Friday night.  In short, it's just brainless fun.
6305784116|4.0|I first saw this movie when it was first released in 1970 when I was 9.  I loved it as did my little sister and parents.  I liked the little mouse Rochfert the best.  And it made me sad many years later when I took my grandmother to see this movie on a re-release to the theaters and saw it horribly edited and Rochfert's role almost nonexistant.  Even today when I bought the vhs of The Aristocats, his role was smaller than it was in 1970.  He was the narrator and made it a point to let us know of his fondness for the stories of Sherlock Holmes.  I do hope that some time in the future this movie can be restored to its original beauty.<br />Still the movie is fun and the music is wonderful.  Phil Harris and Eva Gabor were great in their respective roles and the kittens made me laugh. Another enjoyable moment happens when O'Mally introduces Duchess and her kittens to his music making pals and a night of music and dance occurs. <br />One point should be made to other people who missed it, there was some violence in this movie, though small in content it is still there.  It occurs in the climax when the butler tries to get Duchess and her children for the last time and ends up being  done in by all the animals.<br />This a Disney keeper and should be part of anyone's video library, even in its edited form.
B000002NE4|5.0|If one thing can be said about Nick Cave's illustrious career, it's that there has always been a shroud around Cave the man. We know Cave the artist: obsessed with Southern Gothic culture and ritual, he has painted brilliant, inspired tales of love, hate, sin, etc. But stories only serve to filter emotions, not really expose them. Although his albums have ranged from incindiary to plaintif, never have they been stripped bare of pretense like this one is. Even &quot;Let Love In&quot; was delivered from a distance, with the traditional Cave swagger.<br />Now comes &quot;The Boatman's Call&quot; and it is superb. The music is sparse (mainly piano/bass/violin/light percussion), which suits the lyrical mood. There are no rockers here -- so check out &quot;Tender Prey&quot; if you're looking for some Nick Cave that rocks. <br />The piano/melody on &quot;Into My Arms&quot; is simply heartbreaking and is the high point of the album, although &quot;Far From Me&quot; is a close second with a terrific bass/piano arrangement. &quot;Green Eyes&quot; use of the &quot;c&quot; word strays a bit from the overall tone of the album, but what else can you expect from ol' saint Nick? <br />A lot of old fans were disappointed by this effort, but I thought it took tremendous courage to do something different and genuine. This is as close as Nick Cave has let his fans come to knowing what's inside him, and as always, it is immensely intriguing.
B000002J1I|4.0|I have to take issue with the many negative reviews that &quot;Tormato&quot; has gotten from other customers.  Many of those reviewers use the word &quot;completist&quot; in describing those who would buy this particular album.  Well, I am not a completist (&quot;Tormato&quot; and &quot;Fragile&quot; are the only Yes CD's I care to own), nor am I a hard core fan of the band (I hated Tales from Topographic Oceans and 90215).  Nevertheless, I consider this to be a good collection of songs.<br />On &quot;Tormato&quot;, the band pretty much eschews its penchant for longer, FM radio oriented tracks in favor of shorter tunes.  Of particular note are &quot;Future Choice&quot;, &quot;Don't Kill the Whale&quot;, and &quot;Release Release&quot;, all of which feature superb work from all five  members.  I can't say I particularly cared for &quot;Circus of Heaven&quot;, on which vocalist Jon Anderson's son assisted the old man.  The standout tracks on &quot;Tormato&quot; are &quot;Arriving UFO&quot;, on which guitarist Steve Howe and keyboardist Rick Wakeman complement each other to a driving beat courtesy of bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White.  Anderson creates a touching, reflective setting in &quot;Onward&quot;.  The best track on the disc is &quot;On the Silent Wings of Freedom&quot;, on which Squire showcases his talent as the best rock bassist this side of Paul McCartney, vastly superior to the overrated Geddy Lee of Rush with whom he is often compared.<br />You don't have to be a completist to enjoy this CD, and I'll even admit it's not one of Yes's best.  But I still like it.  And you should listen for yourself and decide.
B00003CX95|3.0|&quot;Braveheart&quot; is an entertaining crowd-pleasing epic with wonderful battle scenes, but Mel Gibson makes Wallace too perfect. EVERYONE has flaws, so when Mel ignores Wallace's flaws it makes himself look arrogant. So William was: a great lover, a great fighter, a wise man, an intelligent man, an expert strategist, and in the end Christ (dying for his people, getting betrayed by those closest to him). If you want to see a compelling epic that actually deals with the main charcter's faults see &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, if you want to see a fun piece of Hollywood fluff watch &quot;Braveheart&quot;.
0930289331|5.0|I've been introduced to Frank Miller's 'Batman' stories namely by hype alone, and the hype is more than warranted. Miller writes 'Year One' the way Batman needs to be portrayed - gritty, dark and murky; all buzz-words that have become cliches for Millers work, and for the right reason. This is a crime story, true and simple. <br />Batman here is hardly the invincible super-hero steroetyped by our culture. Here he is just a man, one who's committed to the task of cleaning up Gotham City of the criminal element. He can be wounded, he can make mistakes, but he also gets the job done. The book also focuses on the young Jim Gordon, who would one day become Gotham's police commissioner and Batman's confidant. Here he's a young cop with all the failings and imperfections of a man striving to do whats right. Miller writes the dialogue with stark realism, and I felt like I was reading about true multi-dimensional characters.<br />With this book and his seminal 'Dark Knight Returns', Miller takes the icon of Batman out of the garish hands of the neon-lighted buffoonery of Hollywood and back into the shadowed streets where he was meant to be. Buy this book.
B000022TSV|4.0|If you'd rather not see a bullfighter kill a bleeding bull, don't buy this DVD. It's rather disgusting, and especially traumatizing to children who may not realize that bull fights require the animal to be stabbed, cut, beaten, tortured, and eventually killed with a sword through its temple. And that's just the beginning of the DVD!<br />Also rather annoying is that the opera's Overture is played over the arena's cheering crowd instead of being presented pure with just film credits showing (as on many traditional treatments of musicals in film).<br />Those points aside, I thought the movie was very well done. The picture and sound quality is excellent, especially on DVD digital! The singing is wonderful, and everyone looks great. I completely disagree with Leonard Maltin's review above.<br />Having not seen the competing DVD version conducted by Zubin Mehta, I can't tell you which one is better in my opinion. But I can say that this DVD is widescreen, gorgeous locations, very good acting, excellent singing, and great sound overall. (If the lip syncing is a little off at times, it's forgivable.)<br />There's a bit too much &quot;crowd noise&quot; for me in some scenes where I'd really rather hear just the music, but since this is a filmed version and not a purist reproduction, I shouldn't complain :)
B0000584V3|5.0|I have been looking forward to Opeths new release for a long time now.  I wondered if they could release a 5th consecutive perfect album.  I knew that they had the first time I heard this, and it blew me away. But it wasn't until the second time I listened to it that I realized that this CD is more than perfect... it is a masterpiece.  I love everything that Opeth does, but Blackwater Park will no doubt quickly become my favorite.  I had always assumed that Morningrise would remain their best cd,(or at least my favorite) but this one might give it a run for it's money. The procuction on this disc is great...very crisp.  Musicaly, it is more in the vein of their last two albums, but I truely believe that Blackwater Park has perfected that style. If you are one of the many that love Opeth, but don't think that they will ever be able to top Morningrise, you may be in for a surprise.  While this disc continues in the style of MAYH and Still Life, I suspect that many will regard Blackwater as their best.(at least out of those three) Still, everything Opeth has done is perfect in my opinion.  Can't wait to see them live.
0131103628|5.0|The first time software development ever really scared me was working through the exercises in this book on my old XT clone. I discovered that I &quot;thought&quot; in C already. The language packaged the constructs which I had been translating into FORTRAN at work.<br />I already knew Pascal, FORTRAN, BASIC, and assembler, so I wasn't a virgin programmer. But The C Programming Language turned my life around--it handed me a language which naturally mapped to the way I thought through programming problems. Working the exercises in this book not only taught me the C language, but it also tightened up my programming style.<br />The book begins in a non-threatening manner, and walks the reader through the basics of software creation in C. From the simple, classic &quot;hello world&quot; program to useful utilities, this book makes software creation seem easy. It teaches not only the C language, but also the discipline of writing quality code.
B000056K04|1.0|This just doesn't compare with any other DMB albums at all. A few reviewers are stumped as to why people are trashing this album. They are the blind majority of people who don't know real music from commercial mass market garbage if it stared them in the face. Buy any or all previous works by DMB but by all means, stay away from this disaster.
0553573403|4.0|I like the fact that a lot of the good guys do die in this book.The violence depicted is totally justified considering the period that he is trying to emulate.I do hope the other two books in the saga are as gripping as this one.<br /> The biggest problem I had with this book is the fact that the pace in the initial 500 pages is really slow compared to the other 300 pages. It would have been much better if he had kept it a little shorter especially the parts where the Daenerys appears which seem to go on and on......
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is a grat album, In my opinion is beautyfuly performed by Dido and produced with great style and perfection. It is a breath of fresh air in world full of nonsense comercial music .I just love it and love her!!!
B00004YW6I|5.0|&quot;Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea&quot; is one of the few cds by an established artist that was released in 2000 that didn't disappoint me, unlike Radiohead's &quot;Kid A&quot;. PJ Harvey totally kicks out the Jams on this cd especially with songs like &quot;Good Fortune&quot; and &quot;Big Exit&quot;. PJ's voice commands attention from the listener with it's power. I personally consider this cd PJ's best, next to her debut album &quot;Dry&quot;.
B000056VIY|5.0|Her royal booty-ness recruited her talented boyfriend, Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs, to help her make her follow-up to 1999's multiplatinum &quot;On The 6&quot; just as hot. The Result? A salsa-and-flamenco fest fused with pop &amp; R&amp;B. This album is much stronger &amp; more danceable that the last! I promise, it's muy caliente! <br />Best Song: &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot;
B00004ZD69|4.0|The band's name is Godspeed You Black Emperor, the album title is 'lift yr. skinny fists like antennas to heaven!'. No, these folks don't hide their pretentiousness. Eighty minutes of enigmatic instrumental music featuring movement titles that are even more pretentious than the album title, lift yr. skinny fists... is definitely not for everybody, but if you're a fan of new music that's daring and challenging, this cd is right up your alley.<br />The entire two-cd album consists of four twenty-minute tracks (two to a disc) containing droning, elaborate music that sounds like equal parts of Sonic Youth, Brian Eno, The Velvet Underground, and John Cage. It starts off quiet, builds to a powerful crescendo, settles down with ambient melodies, adds a few samples of various field recordings, builds up to another roaring climax, settles down again...you see where I'm going. Basically, that's the album in a nutshell. Sounds very dull, but the way GYBE goes about arranging and playing their fine music is what ultimately makes the album palatable. It's not easy to listen to, especially the first time, but after many listens, like Radiohead's Kid A, you notice it has a grandiose, unsettling beauty similar to that of Gaudi architecture, Breughel paintings, or William Burrough's poetic imagery.<br />What's even more impressive is how GYBE uses minimal electronic enhancements. Aside from some very strange samples (an am/pm public address statement encouraging patrons to ignore homeless people, a religious fanatic, an old man's recollections of Coney Island, and some Quebecois kids singing), the album consists of the band just playing the music. The sound is muddy, especially compared to something like Kid A, but it has more of a human feel to it that Radiohead's album lacked.<br />I think the album would have been greater if it had one more big, A-Day-In-The-Life climax at the end, but instead, it peters out in the last six or seven minutes. After all those sonic ups and downs, ending on a positive note might have seemed more in keeping with the uplifting album title, but the band chose to end the record on a bleaker note, and considering how alienating the music sounds at times, I suppose it's fitting.<br />Lift yr. skinny fists... comes with a handy libretto (for lack of a better word) that maps out the various movements in the music, and if you thought the album title was a bit too much, the movement titles are worse. GYBE revels in their pretentiousness, but once you get beyond that, what emerges is a very satisfying listening experience.
B0000027G6|5.0|I believe that sensitive people, will always love Barry's work as much as i do; His music brought out so many feelings that i actually don't know how to describe, it is so romantic and so melancholic at the same time...it is a must to have, not only this soundtrack, but most of his scores. It is simply wonderful to know there's someone in this world able to touch our hearts in such a wonderful,pure and lovely way.
0767802470|5.0|This is one of those movies that does not let you down.<br />It is all about German sailors in a Submarine looking for adventure in the sea but find the horrors of war instead.<br />The sound effects are so good that you can really feel your in the sub with them ( if you have a home theater system ).<br />This movie is a pshycological ride as well as a physical ride and it is not one of those hollywood rip off's.<br />this is a classic.<br />one more thing, although this is a fictional story. The REAL Captain of THE U96 visited the set when the movie was being made.<br />Jurgen Prochnow's charactor (the captain) was based on the real man. the real man's name is Heinerich (forgot his last name). That is all I know.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album finds the Beatles at their most enthusiastic and exciting time.  Revolver is one of the first truly experimental pop albums that showed what was possible in the recording studio.  The unorthodox recording style set a blueprint for all pop music to come.  Not only that but Revolver contains some of the best songs from Lennon and McCartney, and reveals George Harrison's budding talent as a song writer.  John's lush &quot;i'm only sleeping&quot; sways and glides lazily along with beautiful acoustic guitars and harmonies that are sugar sweet, to be topped off with a sublime BACKWARDS electric guitar solo.  Paul's &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; reveals the poetic possiblities in pop music, as his voice soars over an intense, thrilling orchestra.  George takes a dive into Indian raga music with his &quot;Love You Too&quot;, a song about love and spirituality, played on sitar and tabla with electric guitar feed back at the end.  John Lennon's &quot;Tommorrow Never Knows&quot; is only the beginning of the sonic experimentation to come in the 60's, a chaotic pulsing track punctuated by McCartneys tape loop experimentations.  Revolver is full of surprises and is a beautiful statement of the power music has.
B000002MJC|5.0|&quot;Songs..&quot; is a great Depeche Mode release full of religious (or one might say 'anti-religion') themes. &quot;I Feel You&quot; is a gritty, coffee-grits, nails-on-the-chalkboard song which makes you want to grit your teeth and eat sandpaper. I RatMouse get off on this sort of gritty sound. &quot;Walking In My Shoes&quot; and &quot;Higher Love&quot; are awesome! This album shows maturity in a band which would reach its full wisdom with &quot;Ultra&quot;.
B00003CXRP|3.0|I'm sure many of you saw the extended trailer at the movie theater.  If not, go watch it online.  Now that you've seen the entire movie, you don't need to buy it.  The movie is alright, not what I consider Oscar material, but it is interesting to see what Tom Hanks looks like when he starves himself for a long time.  But after watching the trailer, there's no point in seeing the movie!
B000056K04|5.0|People People, don't you all see what's happening here?  The music changes, and on this CD it has changed from past albums, but has it really changed that much?  It isn't too great a leap of faith to see the connection between Everyday and Before these Crowded Streets.  If you really listened to his music then you'd see that the more things change the more things stay the same.  This CD is my favorite CD of his so far.  If you don't agree, or you think he's &quot;sold out&quot; that's just tough ...s for you because you're missing out.  Actually on second thought, stop liking him so that more of us who are true fans will be able to get tickets, not because its the cool thing to go see Dave, but because we enjoy and know quality music when we hear it.
B00004XOWN|5.0|I love this cd. number 5 is the best.
B00004TH83|5.0|If you love Whitney, Bab's, Celine, and Mariah you will be in heaven when you hear Lara Fabian!  This CD has rapidly become one of my favorites and &quot;Adagio&quot;, &quot;Love by Grace&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; are such beautiful songs that you can listen to them over and over without ever getting bored.  The upbeat songs are catchy and you'll even find yourself tapping your foot with the beat.  They're &quot;feel good&quot; songs that give a gloomy day a little lift.  Grab a little bit of history before the rush - buy this CD!  This girl's on her way...
0743201140|3.0|In reading some of the reviews about this book people seem to go back to one reoccuring theme which embraces the initial concept of relying on your strengths for success.  That premise is the cornerstone of the book, but it gets bogged down from there with semantics.  You MUST go back to Donald Clifton's very first book...&quot;Soar With Your Strengths&quot;, written about ten years ago.  This is the book that gives the general parameters of their original concept and although broad in scope, is very effective in changing your outlook on life.  As someone who makes a living out of speaking to people, I use this book as the premise of my presentations and you'd be amazed how overwhelmed people are when they hear the principals of that first book.  Although this book has some good moments, it doesn't justify the work.  Give people the premise and let them apply it to their own lives. In the end, the authors had it right the very first time.
6305546789|5.0|&quot;Halloween&quot; is a funhouse, pure and simple.  Not much logic, rhyme, or reason, but John Carpenter made every effort to scare the hell out of his audience.  You gotta give him credit for that, because he could have made a lousy film that probably would have netted him as much money.  The film opens with a six year boy who stabs his older sister to death on Halloween night, 1963.  After fifteen years of silence in a mental hospital, he escapes and returns to his hometown where he stalks three young women.  We assume here that they spark that distant memory of his older sister.  With his long suffering psychiatrist (Donald Pleasance) on his trail, he seeks new victims on Halloween night.  Jamie Lee Curtis makes her debut as feisty Laurie Strode, for which she was paid $8,000.  Story development and logic take a back seat to all the scares, but Carpenter knows how to play his audience, and he does it very well.  Curtis and Pleasance returned in 1981 for &quot;Halloween II&quot;, a respectable but overly graphic sequel that picks up immediately after this one ends.  Pleasance returned for three more sequels after that and Curtis returned to the fold in 1998's &quot;Halloween H20&quot;.
B00003CXFV|4.0|I had seen many of the movies of Julia Roberts but this has really topped my list of must have it.  I have never seen Julia in such down to earth, beautiful and no mess around attitude like acting before.  &quot;My Best Friends Wedding&quot; was sweet but this movie will remain in people's heart and mind for a long time.  She has put all her looks aside and created a masterpiece of the chracter. I think the real Erin Brokovich will be over the tops seeing this autobiography played all over the world. Hope it nominates for an Oscar.
0743201140|5.0|I found this book to be extremely helpful, both as a tool in understanding myself and in understanding my emplotyees. After taking the Strengthfinder test, I bought each of my 11 direct reports a copy of the book so that I could better understand their strengths and our strengths as a team. <br />The book was interesting and well written, far more practical than most management books and far more insightful than self-help books.<br />I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to better understand themselves, their employees, their family or their friends!!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Whether or not you agree with their politics, you can't help but love this album! Not one dull or &quot;un-Rage-like&quot; song. In my opinion, this is one of the two best rock albums ever(the other being Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot;).  From the opening song &quot;Testify,&quot; to the closing song &quot;War Within a Breath,&quot; nothing will stop you from getting up and banging your head. In a matter of years, this album should be on any rock fans top ten list, I know it will be on mine.
B000056VIY|4.0|This is definitely a good cd to have.  O.K. So it's not Whitney or Mariah, who cares?  JLo apparently is in the Janet Jackson camp with this CD.  Actually, JLo reminds me of some of Janet's earlier CDs.  Music doesn't always have to be serious.  Sometimes you just want to have fun and sing along.<br />For the females, check out &quot;Thats'Not Me&quot;  It was written by one of the girls in the now defunct group XSCAPE.  All females can relate to this song.<br />All in all, JLo was worth the money.  Everyone else needs to lighten up!
B000000HTM|5.0|... literally. It's hard to breathe at some points of this recording for fear of pushing the band, singer and all, over the edge on which they're dancing into the abyss. I've listened to a lot of music of many different types over the years, and this recording is one of the most beautiful and frightening I've ever heard. I wonder what my life would have been like if I had bought this as a teenager rather than &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans.&quot;<br />&quot;Pawn Hearts&quot; [...] is a powerful as &quot;White Light/White Heat,&quot; and should be bought by anyone whose mind is connected to their gut via the ears.
6304258984|5.0|The Rock fires on all cylinders; it's full of action, plot, suspense, and great acting.  You'll care about the main characters, you'll actually think that you didn't waste your time for once, and you'll probably watch it again!  More movies should be like this.
B000003BF1|5.0|To start with, this is by arguably the \\"best\\" rock and roll band in terms of fan response. If there has ever been a finer audio production of any sort, it would have to be a BMI classic. Every note, every chord, every chorus, etc., etc., is pure perfection here. This disc captures the band at its absolute apex, right before their Altamont catastrophe, but on the heels of a highly successful American tour. In terms of rich, full sound, no other album can come to terms with this one, including the Martin/Beatles gems. The Stones career highpoint. And what a career it's been!
6304681496|2.0|Nicolas Cage's acting hits an all-time low in this movie with one of the worst characters he's ever played.  The film tries in numerous way to entertain, but it just didn't click with me.
B000024A70|4.0|Of course this compilation is great.  It's got most of the cream of Queen's crop (huh?) and is expanded from the version on LP/Cassette I grew up listening to.  With one exception:  What in the hell did they do with &quot;Under Pressure&quot;?  This is DEFINITELY not one you leave off!  Hell, &quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot; and &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot; should have been axed WAY before the classic Queen/Bowie collaboration.  Even &quot;Flash&quot; (which for some unknown reason, i still like) should have been left off in favor of &quot;U.P.&quot;.  That's really the only reason not to give this 5 stars...that and there are quite a few killer album tracks that no GH will have (&quot;Misfire&quot;, &quot;Who Needs You&quot;, &quot;Don't Try Suicide&quot;)so you should really pursue the original albums, which you probably will after starting out with this primer.  <br />Although Queen is not everyone's cup of tea, anyone who can appreciate good music should respond to Freddie Mercury's voice and Brian May's guitar playing is mandatory listening IMO.  And the best part of all of it is Queen's songs.  Adventurous, heavy, melodic, hilarious, pomp, and a multitude of styles.  This is totally the surface of a great band, but worth coming back to even after you own every album.
B00004Y62T|1.0|This movie never goes anywhere for about the first 90 minutes.  You get to see conversations between snooty rich white people and pasty Matt Damon about wine cellars.  Whee!  I swear, only a millionaire would know what they're talking about.  The film moves as fast as an old man in the 1984 Buick hogging both lanes of the road.  Near the end of the movie, you won't care what's going on. Oh by the way, I absolutely LOVED the predictable ending.  It really fooled me!  Don't watch unless you need a cure for Insomnia.
B000056K04|5.0|As someone who has enjoyed the unique, very musically tallented sound of the Dave Matthews Band since the release of &quot;Under The Table And Dreaming&quot;, I was anxious to het my hands on their new album &quot;Everyday&quot;.  However, when I heard about the appointment of Ballard as the new producer, I couldn't help wondering if it was a change for the better or not.  But when February 27th rolled around and I finally heard the finished product, I was pleasantly surprised.  Though the songs are shorter and a new sound has surfaced, the band retained its musical and creative integrity.  Overall, I was very satisfied with what the DMB released.  I would recomend it to loyal listeners and newcomers alike.  A well structured and extremely entertaining album.
0790737973|4.0|I don't understand why the movie got such bad reviews; it is suspenseful, has a great cast of characters, and has a nice plot.  A few part were a little lame, but I defiantly suggest this movie.
B00004RHZU|5.0|okay ya guys if u like R&amp;B and like umm ... youMUST get this CD.  I love it. The songs are all really good and have alot of meaning and a good beat so i listen to it all the time and idont get bored with it.  anyhow but yeah all the songs r great.  idont usually find a cd where i like every song but on this one i do.i highly suggest that you buy it! theres nuthin else 2 really say.pink has an amazing voice.
B00004W5UA|4.0|If your looking for something unique in a nothing-new-under-the-sun hollywood, this is the film you should get.  One of those few movies that you will enjoy watching and get you thinking at the same time.
B00000AFWW|3.0|A noise came from behind me like ewww[...]  I turn to realize that it wasn't me...it was her and that fricken CD!  I'd say if you related to this CD then you should spend your money on a Doctor of Mental Health.  The music, short of finding another word for it, is basic and lacks any creativity.  The words are mindless and without direction.  Maybe I'm wrong, but the album smells like teen waste!
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This movie is great.  The viual and audion quality has been redone very well.  Despite the outdated clothes, the movie looks like it could have been filmed yesterday.  The movie starts of slow, with lots of cheesy dialogue, but what horror movie doesn't.  After the first half hour, get ready to be scared.  There is only two movies that scare me, the Excorcist, and this Evil Dead.  The movie is disturbing, scary, and well written.  I highly recomend this DVD as well as the two sequels.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Well, I think this is one of the best greatest-hits colection ever!!! It just brings back all those memories. I think it shouldn't miss in your collection of compacts.
B000059R8Y|5.0|Again, after the excellent Pilgrum, Clapton changes his musical direction with Reptile.  This album is a strange clashing of styles, but with each one he tackles, he does so like a master.  Very good.  Very nice.
B000059MEK|5.0|Daft Punk has created an instant classic with Discovery. One More Time is already a club anthem, and with tracks like Aerodynamic and Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger this cd just skyrockets up the classic list. Only downfalls are the tracks that are obviously record company forced pop hit tracks. But otherwise, this cd is a MUST! Daft Punk is back in full force.
B00000BKDX|5.0|A live recording cannot capture the intensity of a heavy metal concert. Comparatively speaking, however, Live After Death does it better than any other live metal album. The impeccable sound quality belies the fact that this album was recorded in the mid-80s (it sounds better than 99% of all modern live recordings). Even better though, is the fact that this concert comes from a time when Iron Maiden, the quintessential metal band, was young and full of energy. I wasn't there, but I can tell that this show was a blast.<br />Song selection is perfect, encapsulating most of the band's best songs from their preceding studio albums, and each one is impeccably performed, often better than the studio counterparts. The mini-epic &quot;Powerslave&quot; definitely gains something special when the crowd screams at Bruce's stylish entry. &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name's&quot; main riff is played faster and the song gains more intensity as a result. This version of &quot;The Trooper&quot; makes the studio version seem tepid in comparison. Then there's &quot;Phantom of the Opera,&quot; which is simply incredible with Bruce's sinister intonations.<br />It's awesome. If you don't buy it, you suck.
6303212379|1.0|I gave up on it after 20 minutes.  Whatever Steven Speilburg and company were thinking on this turkey, I'll never know.  I have actually lost &quot;friends&quot; over my dislike of this film.  THe problem areas for me were the broken statue scene and the &quot;let's spook the Spanish only speaking maid&quot; scene.  The movie could easily have done without those two.  Maybe I would have made it through.
B000056K04|2.0|I am a huge fan of DMB. Who knows Dave, mabey you're reading this. I have been to numerous concerts and this band has always managed to keep the same groovy sound. After purchasing &quot;Under the Table...&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot;, and &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;, I could put in the album and listen to it all the way through. I find myself constantly skipping through songs on &quot;Everyday&quot;. The only 3 songs I would consider listening to again are &quot;I Did It&quot;, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot;. There is little (if any acoustic guitar) and no instrumental solos. I would release a live album quick just to overshadow this one. Dave, take my advise and go back to the basics with your next album......
B00003CWTI|4.0|The movie is not what you are used to. The unusual narrative, which jumps from one storyline to the other, adds a lot to make magnolia a very special movie, certainly unlike any you've seen. Another very interesting point is that it doesn't have a &quot;main story&quot; or even a &quot;main actor/actress&quot;. Innovative and far from being deceptive. The mix of the stories is very well conducted, not rendering your mind useless if you blink, like other I've seen experiences on this area. It'll stay on your mind, keeping you thinking, and soon you'll watch it again. And you'll find it even more pleasant. The DVD is great. Top video and audio, the extras are worth it, specially non included scenes of Mr. Frank T. J. Mackey Seduce and Destroy seminar. The movie is long, but will keep your mind's attention.
B0000024K1|5.0|After being bombarded with this &quot;say nothing&quot; hip hop rap of today. I took out this CD from my collection the other day and listening to it reminded me that rap music use to have something signifigant to say and the minds of the &quot;Public Enemy Era&quot; helped defined some important stages in American history.  It's revolutionary. <br />I loved this cd and still do.  It just takes a little more intellegence and prospective to understand.  <br />It has something for everyone.
B000056K04|4.0|I've seen a lot of reviews ranging from &quot;I hate it&quot; to &quot;the best ever.&quot;  These are no doubt coming from the DMB purists and the Top 40 heads that want Dave to get his radio exposure.<br />My opinion is this ... it's good, but not his best.  The best is arguably Before These Crowded Streets, but don't discount Everyday because of it's radio friendliness.  The songs are catchy, well-written, and thought/spiritually/emotionally provoking.  Dave shows his diversity by picking up an electric guitar and shows why he's one of the best guitarists around with his opening riff in &quot;I Did It.&quot;  &quot;The Space Between&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; remind us why &quot;Crash Into Me&quot; was so good.  &quot;So Right&quot; and &quot;Fool To Believe&quot; are the best songs on the CD.  Sure, Boyd and Leroi don't get their usual solos, but listen to them on &quot;Fool to Believe&quot; and they'll give you chills with 4 simple notes.<br />This CD has one thing that all the others don't ... you can play this one from start to finish.  Every song has something you'll love about it.  DMB is my favorite band, and I want to see them perform and release CDs for many years to come.  This cannot happen without the band reinventing themselves, and adjusting their sound to the times.  There IS a reason why all the Dead Heads were dressing in tye-dyed t-shirts 30 years after it went out of style.  I'll be wearing whatever is in style 30 years from now, and I hope I'll be listening to DMB's new CD then as well.  Mostly, the band needs to stay happy with their music, and with each other.  This CD reminded them why they love to make music.  <br />Keep singing, dancing, and playing for us for many years to come, Dave.  I'm going to keep listening.
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World has an interesting concept, but it is certainly not for everyone.  I have some criticism of the book, but also some praise.  First the criticism.  This is really a philosophy text pretending to be a novel.  (Which, I believe is ultimately a good thing).  The characters are not that believable and are really just devices Gaarder uses to get his point across.  The dialog is not believable either.  Another potential problem for certain readers is that the philosophy lessons contained in this book are, in the novel, aimed at a 15 year old girl.  If you have studied philosophy at some point in your life, this will probably be far too simplistic for you.<br />I still would recommend this book and here's why.  Sophie's World will be an excellent read for anyone with a curiosity about philosophy, but who finds the whole thing a bit intimidating.  I think it's a wonderful introduction to philosophy because it is aimed at that 15 year old character.  Even if you have studied philosophy, this book will be thought provoking, if only because it makes you think about what you once studied.  I think this would be a wonderful book for parents of teenage children to read with their children.  It would certainly make for some excellent discussions.  The true strength of this book is the material it covers.  Philosophy is a fascinating subject and Sophie's World is the perfect choice for anyone who would like to gently ease themselves into that subject.
B00000G3PA|5.0|ARMAGEDDON stars Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Liv Tyler, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clark Duncan and Billy Bob Thorton.<br />High octane director Michael Bay (The Rock, Pearl Harbor) rocks the screen at his best with producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Enemy of the State, Crimson Tide) in an intense action drama filled with stunning visual effects, a realistic action packed plot and a thrilling emotional bond built around all the actors.<br />        The plot may be similar to films like Deep Impact, but the story is twisted and smoothed out to an astonishing shine!  After NASA director Dan Truman (Thorton- A Simple Plan) discovers that an asteroid the size of Texas is headed for earth, there is no logical choice other than to send of a team of oil drillers led by Bruce Willis (Sixth Sense, Die Hard) and Ben Affleck (Pearl Harbor, Dogma) into the heavens.  The team must dig to the core of the asteroid and place in a nuclear warhead...  The plot is awesome even though it seems predictable now, it is a very touching, emotional action picture with stunning visual effects that is sure to keep you watching this film over and over.  This film is one of my favorites, siding with Predator, T2, The Rock and The Matrix.  I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who is looking for an awesome movie!
B000006NPY|5.0|I have never been a fan of Smashing Pumpkins until they released the single Ava Adore and i have been hooked ever since.  I bought Adore as i couldnt get the song out of my head, and i found that it was full of songs that were equal if not better in quality than Ava Adore.  With tracks like Perfect, The Tale Of Dusty And Pistol Pete and Once Upon A Time its easy to see why Billy Corgan has built up a huge fan base.
6301966562|5.0|In its time, Electric Dreams was meant as a whimsical look into what possibilities the advance of modern (80's) technology may bring. Watching it now is a fun ride down 80's memory lane. With songs from Jeff Lynne (Electric Light Orchestra), Culture Club and Georgio Moroder, even if you aren't into computers but love 80's music, this movie will be a treat for you. I remember watching this movie as a kid and wondering how I could get my Apple IIC computer to play music as cool as Edgar, the computer in the movie and one of the movie's main characters. As I write this, I am listening to MP3's of the movie's soundtrack, I guess computers have come a long way in 17 years.....
B00003CXSP|1.0|In short-gore does not equal scary. Sadism does not equal terror. This film is virtually suspense-free (in contrast to the taut-as-a-piano wire suspense of 'Silence Of The Lambs'), and instead relies on geek-show theatrics to shock you instead of terrify you. I think 'Hannibal' stinks.<br />P.S. The book isn't any better, either.
B000059MEK|5.0|As I tried to work from home,I couldn't concentrate:my ears were being bombarded with unignorable and delicious sounds.I had just put on the new Daft Punk CD.I played it three times in a row and just couldn't get enough.In trying to describe it to a friend, I could only tell him this: it's kind of a mix between funky Prince,Buggles-&quot;video killed the radio star&quot;,the zany guitar and synthed up Mozart music from &quot;Bill and Ted&quot;, pumping and swirling disco/house vibes,mellow grooves that bob along effortlessly swaying from Pet Shop Boys to E.L.O.,all with visits to the last four decades respectively,along the way .It is all of these things and so much more besides.My friend seemed understandably confused and unimpressed by my ranting description.I insisted he borrow it.It's the only real way to comprehend the magical blueprint for the dance music of today and the many tomorrows that is &quot;Daft Punk-Discovery.&quot;
B000056K04|3.0|I bought &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Listener Supported&quot; at the same time. I listen to &quot;Listener Supported&quot; everyday and have &quot;Everyday&quot; supported against my other older CDs. Everyday&quot; is a change from the DMB we all know. Unfortunately, it's much like the change U2 made when they made &quot;Zooropa&quot; or Bela Fleck with his &quot;Left Of Cool&quot;. Please bring the old DMB back!
0060920084|2.0|Bill Bryson's idea of &quot;discovering&quot; America is driving a few hundred miles to a new city each day, and stepping no more than 25 paces away from his car.  No wonder he's so bitter over everything he finds!  Everything he sees is covered with concrete, greasy spoon restaurants and annoying tacky tourists.  We don't get any useful information about any place he visits, only cynical commentary on the local fat people, or obnoxious tourist trap.  There are a few funny moments, but most of his writing here is so grouchy and listless that the book drags on and on and on.  Anyone who can turn up their nose at Yellowstone National Park, and find absolutely no flaw with Wall Drug has missed the point somewhere.
B000056K04|5.0|Whoever thinks this is a poor Dave Matthews Cd just has shallow music taste and cannot open up their minds to other styles.  This Cd is good from start to finish. The Dave Matthews band can still rock all around the world.
B000059R8Y|3.0|I listened to this album a few days ago.  After hearing many albums by Clapton that were very DULL, i was pleasently suprised at how good this album was.  The opening song is an instumental.  The first time i heard it i thought, how cheesy sounding.  But after a listen or two, it wasn't bad at all.  Reptile is a mix of funk, jazz, rock, and blues.  This whole cd is a really good mix of songs.  Although, it is nowhere near the quality of the &quot;layla years&quot;.  But that is the way most muscians are as they age.  The reason i am giving this 3 stars is because i feel that people grade too generously, giving ever GOOD cd, 5 stars.  If you give it 5 stars, what about the classic albums like Highway 61, Sgt. Peppers, ect?  Anyway, Reptile is Worth buying!
6305078564|5.0|I think it is the best movie I have ever seen.  The characters are wonderful and the costumes are right for the period.  I have read the book and it is vry true to the book.  It highly reccomend the book and movie for a rainy day or just to relax.
B000056K04|1.0|Zero star. Do not pay for this cd. This is better than the hopeless Before These Crowded Streets but that is not saying much. The only difference here is that the songs have form and dont go on forever. The songs, like the songs on Streets, are boring and directionless.  DMB has proven that they are very talented musicians and Matthews is capable of writing great songs (early work). He will not be remembered however as a great songwriter if these back to back throw-aways are any indication of what we can expect in the future.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This album is a must have. It has many brilliant songs such as: Rollin', Take a look around(Mission Impossible 2 theme), Hot Dog, My Generation, The One , My Way the list goes on. Limp Bizcit mixes Rap, Heavy Metal and Rock and his Music is Fantastic. Buy this product and you will not be dissapointed. Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog flavoured Water KICKS!!!!!!!!
0553106635|5.0|great characters, page-devouring pacing, and boot-in-the-stomach plot twists, my only critique is that I'm forced to read something worse when I'm done<br />Jordan and Goodkind take note
B000002OG8|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers that this group was totally underated in the 70's.  Although Warrior was played on the radio for awhile, you never heard much else about them.  (I especially like Leaf and Stream;  I think it is beautiful).  I have owned 2 copies of vinyl and a cassette of Argus since the 70's,and now I am thrilled to have found it on CD.  I play it until I wear it out as a rule.  Can't go wrong here!
0452282152|4.0|Wonderful read!  I would agree that being familiar with the paintings makes the story become more alive.  The relationships in the novel are wonderfully complex and sometimes heartbreaking.  They are gently woven together slowly leading up to a satisfying conclusion.  While on the surface, Griest is a simple maid, she quickly becomes the most captivating character in the novel.  She is surprisingly aware and mature, understanding things beyond her years.  A wonderful historical fiction!
0920668372|5.0|This was a gift when my son was born in Feb. '98. We have read it over and over. We even have a &quot;tune&quot; that we sing the &quot;I'll love you forever&quot; to. <br />Every time I read this book, tears flood my eyes. It makes you appreciate how valuable and prescious the time with your children is.<br />The book is about a mother that sings a song to her ever growing son, as she rocks him on her lap. It takes you from infancy right through adulthood.<br />It is a fantastic book that every mother, father and child will adore for years to come.
B000059T5O|5.0|That is exactly what this disc did to me when I first heard it. I have not stopped grinning yet. John Hammond has taken songs that most of us thought only Tom Waits could do justice to and made them songs that you cannot get out of your mind. From the first cut &quot;2:19&quot; to my favorite cut &quot;16 Shells from a Thirty-Ought 6,&quot; these songs take on the personality of Hammond. With help from some great musicians like Charlie Musselwhite, Augie Myers, and Tom Waits as well as superb production from Waits this is one of the finest recordings of Hammonds in his now 5 decade long career. If you are a fan of Hammonds, this recording will please you. If you are a fan of Waits, you will wonder what took him so long to have Hammond record his songs. If you like the blues, you will have a hard time taking this out of your cd player. If you do not know if you like the blues, this will put a &quot;Wicked Grin&quot; on your face.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie just can't be described in words, but I'll try.  Princess Mononoke may sound like a funny name but its story is far from funny.  it has to be the most amazing thing I have ever watched.  It basically had no GOOD and no EVIL because of peoples different points of view.  If you are planning on this movie being something for the kids cause the word &quot;Princess&quot; is in it think again (I mean just look at the cover, come on.)  This movie has HIGH QUALITY animation and a good story line that will keep you spellbound.  It has some swear words and quite a bit of violence. but if you love animes and are use to seeing violence in them YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ANIME.!  It shows love, greed, power, some good fight scenes, peoples different points of view on thing.
0452282152|5.0|I read this back-to-back with Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland.  I loved Vreeland's book and loved this as well, but do not confuse the two; they are very different books written in different styles.  All they have in common is a Vermeer painting.<br />Girl With a Pearl Earrings presents a fictional account of how this particular Vermeer came to be.  Griet, a young maid of little means, lives with Vermeer's ever-growing family.  A bond of sorts develops between artist and maid, and she becomes the subject of his painting, which goes against conventions, social mores and the wishes of Vermeers wife.<br />There are many surprising little incidents and twists to the story, which I hesitate to outline here.  But suffice to say I found the resolution of the story to be extremely satisifying on Griet's behalf.  Chevalier so clearly depicts Delft in her writing that I can easily envision it in my own mind.  I felt the story was well developed and had a very tight, well-rounded plot.  The majority of the characters are either likable or dislikable...particularly one child, Cornelia, Catharina Vermeer and Pieter the son.<br />I recommend this as well as Vreeland's book.  I also would not discourage reading them together...one complements the other quite well.
B00004XONN|5.0|Back in 1974, Pink Floyd entered the studio faced with the enormously daunting task of recording a follow-up album to their masterpiece &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;. Having pushed the limits of rock and roll innovation with &quot;Dark Side&quot;, their initial idea was to record an &quot;anti-rock&quot; album of songs using non-musical objects such as spoons, hammers, empty bottles, etc. The album, which was to have been entitled &quot;Household Objects&quot;, was eventually scrapped after a few unsatisfactory experiments and Pink Floyd went on to record the Progressive Rock opus &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. Fastforward 25 years. Radiohead, faced with the daunting task of following-up THEIR masterpiece, &quot;OK Computer&quot;, releases the ultimate &quot;anti-rock&quot; statement &quot;Kid A&quot;. Full of blips, bloops and walls of ambient noise, Radiohead has taken a bold artisitc step and in the process may have alienated and confused many of the listeners it gained with &quot;OK Computer&quot;. It's almost as if there's a race going on to pioneer the future of rock and Thom Yorke is determined to be the Paul McCartney of his generation. If you approach the album with an opened mind (and alot of patience initially) &quot;Kid A&quot; will reward you with a thoughtful, daring and experimental head trip like no other.
B000002IAZ|3.0|If you purchase this disc, you are going to get just the slightest nibble of the profound greatness of this influencial group of singers &amp; songwriters. You'll wind up buying at least the first and second albums too; and then the completist side of you will begin obsessing, and you'll break down and buy the third.    By buying all three of Buffalo Springfield's discs, you'll skip the agony of deciding which one to get first. They're not that expensive, anyway. And who knows when there will ever be a box set with the goodies that longtime fans are hungry for.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Pitch Black is a good Saturday night creature feature.  If you want deep science fiction see Blade Runner, Alien, or The Lathe of Heaven.  If you want thrills from wave after wave of vicious bugs, then Starship Troopers or Pitch Black fits the bill.  Neither one will make you scratch your head, but they're fun for an hour and a half.<br />Two minor complaints though.  1) They never really go into the ecology of the planet.  How can anything live in such a desolate place?  Were there large underground caverns teaming with life that could support these carnivores?  Or did the bugs subsist purely on a diet of scientists and crash-landed astronauts?  2) The eclipse was a little too convenient.  Ok, the two suns go into an extended eclipse once every 22 years.  The coincidence that our heroes (and one anti-hero) crash land right before this rare solar event was a touch distracting to me.<br />But I admit that I'm being nit-picky.  If you take it for what it is, Pitch Black is very worth the price of admission.
076790382X|5.0|Every time I picked this book up and read on it would make me laugh out loud.  Since it is a compilation of articles that Bill Bryson wrote for an English magazine or newpaper it is split into very nicely written 2-3 page chapters.  It is a great book to read if you ride the train or bus to work and can only get in 15-20 minutes of reading at a time since none of the writing is related.  Bill Bryson is what we would call 'Mr. Bitterman' because he is quite bitter at times but it is all in good fun.  Since it is written for a foreign audience it is very intersting to see how we are seen by the outside world.  He covers almost every daily topic from going to the post office to dealing with setting up a new computer and always makes as fun of as much as possible including his own ineptitudes.  If you have read his books before you will love this one and if you have not you should give it a try.  Once you read one of his books you will want to read them all because they will all make you laugh.  If you do not laugh within the first few pages then this might not be your kind of humor.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is one of the best and I repeat one of THE best cds I've ever listened to. The lyrics are superb and the voice is amazing. After the coming up the so called pop divas and boy-bands, this tone had disappeared from the world of music for a while. The songs like Spies..Trouble..Yellow..Shiver..High Speed..I could actually name the whole album in that matters..that the music is going to draw you in. Though people tend to think of the music more as depressive in the beginning but they actually portrays ecstasy at the extreme levels.People who were the fans of the band... will love this album, me being one of them!!!
B00000J7SS|5.0|The best musicians in Jazz played on Bitches Brew, but the sessions were almost cancelled Due to an argument between Miles and his longtime producer, Teo Macero, that almost came to blows. Macero: Take your trumpet and your musicians and get out of here!. So we got another masterpiece from Miles who might have provoked the incident to get a better performance from his band.
B000056K04|2.0|Ok, this CD sux. The songs are all too poppy and stadium rock like. I mean my punk friend, who loves the  Sex Pistols bought it and likes it more than I do. I'm a big fan of all their old albums. I have the DVD. I play all their songs, and even covered &quot;Granny&quot; for a school talent show. By all means, I am a fan, but not of this album. I'm very happy for Dave for getting out of his depression, but couldn't he have channeled his happiness in a different way. We all would have been happy if he had gone on a 2 year break (i.e. Phish, another great band) and came back with some great sounding stuff that actually was Dave like.  But no, he had to get rid of Lillywhite (who produced  all of their good albums) and get Ballard the Bastard who made 10 songs in 10 days. That's not a good time at all to write a good album. Under the Table was written on and worked on and perfected for at least a year, and that's a great CD. Sure this has it's good song. Not songs, song. I mean If I Had It All. Angel and Space Between are allright. But for now, this CD is in it's case. If you want good dave, don't buy this. Pop Live at Red Rocks into your CD player, and get high on the groove. It's a much better idea.
B0000524E5|2.0|I bought this movie because I love Jerry Bruckheimer movies.  I should have just rented it.  The only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes, all of which were shown in the trailer.  That about sums up the good scenes.  When I watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find Piper Perabo, I couldn't believe it!  Perabo's acting was so annoying, she ruined the whole movie for me.  Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded.  I just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling!  I'm one of those people who like all kinds of movies, even some really bad ones, but this is one that I don't think I will be watching again.
6300247120|5.0|I saw this film for the first time when I was 5 years old (because of my father's love to bicycles) and have seen it 50 more times during the last 20 years. A must-see for All !
B000002WYT|5.0|Ok, there are different kinds of Dave Matthews fans.  I personally own all his cds, including his a bit disappoiting but still fun new Everyday cd, and have several of my favorite songs of his' lyrics on my wall.  In my opinion this is his best lyrical and guitar cd, as songs like Two Step and Crash will remain classics forever.  Whether you already adore Dave or you're just trying to figure him out this is the cd to get.  Be sure to listen to not very well known songs like Lie in Our Graves, that particular song rocks by the way!   Have fun with this cd, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
6305426651|5.0|I was very moved by this movie, and I agree with another reviewer that it wasn't &quot;exploitative&quot;. The Holocaust was the background.. the setting. The characters weren't backdrops to the story of the Holocaust, but rather the situation they were in simply emphasized the beauty within the main characters.<br />The lives of the characters were terribly affected by the Holocaust, of course, but the experience of the Holocaust did not MAKE the characters. It demonstrated their wonderful integrity, particularly in the characters played by Begninni and Braschi. <br />It is a refreshing look at the horrible experience of the Holocaust -- from the viewpoint of a person who DOES maintain his integrity and refuses to be beaten down, even to the moment of death. It was a story of the spirit winning over all attempts to destroy it. <br />I think it's important to not forget what happened, but the way this movie was put together was uplifting, too. <br />I don't normally watch movies that deal with real tragic material, because it can be just too upsetting to me, especially when children are involved. (I have six kids, and somehow this has altered my &quot;sentimentality factor&quot;.) I can say that this movie is safe to watch! There is grief, but it's bearable, and I smiled at the end.<br />Definitely worth buying!
B000002JSJ|5.0|The band enters a cold basement studio in the middle of a Munich winter in which they have to get out of by three weeks to allow the Rolling Stones to record there. <br />The lead singer doesn't really know if he will ever walk again without a limp. The lead guitarist has recently developed a heroin addiction. The drummer drinks too much and uses painkillers like he was Elvis Presley. The band has spent the good part of the last year away from their homes and families in tax exile. Their previous album made them even more famous than they ever had been and there is pressure to put out another classic. And add to all that, no one is really having fun anymore.<br />What was the result of all this madness? &quot;Presence&quot;. An album that lets you hear Zeppelin fighting for their lives. It almost sounds as an invitation for the listener to be privy to their no-holds-barred jamming in the studio.<br />The first song (Achilles Last Stand) starts off with a twirling, echoing, eery guitar sound only interrupted by a tapping on the drum cymbals until it explodes full force with a thumping bass line from Jones and fine 12-string and 6-string guitar work from Page ... &quot;oh, to touch the dream that hides inside and never seen ...&quot;. This song displays Bonzo's drumming at some of its finest. It could have used maybe two minutes edited out during the &quot;mighty arms of Atlas&quot; part that gets repeated, but other than that it is a majestic rock song (that Heart would later steal for their &quot;Barracuda&quot;).<br />&quot;For Your Life&quot; is one of my favorites on the album. It is an ode to someone dying of a drug overdose recently at Page's house, as well as to the Los Angeles groupies who don't look so fresh and happy anymore, and addicted to cocaine, just living for Zep's return to their city in which Plant pleads for them to get on with their lives. Dig the snarl he does twice in this song. Great tremolo work by Page, and Bonham tries to put a hole in hisbass drum.<br />Funk-personified-at-break-neck speed for &quot;Royal Orleans&quot;, with great Bonzo drumming, (a tremendous leap in musical knowledge from their previous attempt at James Brown funk, &quot;The Crunge&quot;), about a certain band member waking up from a bed fire from a dropped marijuana cigarette and discovering the woman he was partying with now has grown whiskers!!<br />&quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; has another harrowing guitar intro, this time with Plant call-back, and unfortunately reminds me somewhat of &quot;Black Dog&quot;. But this song is saved by fantastic, spastic harmonic work by Plant and great, heavy drumming throughout by Bonham.<br />&quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; has great slap-sounding guitar work, in a loving tribute to the rockabilly music that inspired the band in the days of their youth.  Plant apes Elvis.  I hear the only acoustic guitar on the album playing rhythm in the background here.<br />&quot;Hots On For Nowhere&quot; is a Zep favorite of mine, possibly the most underrated Zep song of all time. Drummer's son, Jason Bonham, recalls being awaken by Plant's &quot;la la, la, l-la, yeah&quot; vocalizations. Funk disguised as hard rock with a riff that will stay with you for days the first time you hear it.<br />&quot;Tea For One&quot; starts off with a blazing riff that scales down to a very depressed blues about being away from loved ones. Again, could have shaved off four minutes or so for this one, but love the interplay between guitar, bass, and drums.  Precision timing by one and all.<br />Overall, a very powerful album from a band wrestling with many problems; one of those magical, beautiful things that comes out once in a great while from tragedy.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Of course, it goes without saying that a collection of 27 Beatles number one hits will contain some of the finest rock and roll music ever, and this CD gives one almost an hour and a half glimpse into the marvelous career of the Fab Four.  Rather than engage in quibbles about what should have been included or not, and given the breadth of the Beatles' material no selection on earth could possibly please everyone, I wonder why another greatest hits album is necessary, given the numerous compliations already out there including the fabulous 62-66 and 66-69 sets.  Still, I suppose this is a wonderful device to introduce the Beatles to a new generation of music lovers, and viewed that way, it is a tremendous compilation that hopefully will lead its listeners to discover some of the great music that may not have made it to number one on the charts but is just as valuable and important musically.
B000056K04|4.0|I can understand someone not liking this CD, but I don't think it's fair to expect any band to stay exactly the same in its fourth major release, musically speaking, as it was in its first.  <br />I will confess to not particularly liking &quot;Everyday&quot; the first time after I listened to it all the way through, but after my fifth go-round I got thoroughly hooked.  Is &quot;Everyday&quot; different from DMB's previous efforts?  Yes, definitely.  The jazzy freeform of the previous three albums is gone, replaced by electric guitar hooks and structured pop, a result of replacing producer Steve Lillywhite with Glen Ballard.  Fans of DMB's freeform jazz style who were expecting more of the same with this album are going to be disappointed.   <br />As a fan of DMB, I can appreciate the great risk the band took in making this album, and although the direction may be upsetting to some, if approached with an open mind, &quot;Everyday&quot; can provide great rewards.  Songs like &quot;Everyday&quot;, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;If I Had it All&quot; may not follow the standard DMB formula, but they are good songs nonetheless.  I'm not sure whether this album represents DMB's conscious effort to break into radio-friendly territory, or whether the next album will continue the trend, but if it does just that, I won't be upset.  Dave Matthews soaking up air time that used to belong to Brittney Spears, 'N Sync and others of their ilk is no great sin.<br />Put simply, &quot;Everyday&quot; is great pop, and that is something rare indeed in these times.
B000021XR5|5.0|STP still remain one of my all-time favorites, despite the fact that a few songs on this cd show that they are startin to lose their grunge sound. Don't get me wrong, Sour Girl &amp; Church on Tuesday are GREAT songs, but they're just, not typical STP. Some good Core-like songs on this cd are Down, Heaven &amp; Hot Rods, No Way Out, &amp; Pruno. Definitely a great one for anyone who likes grunge or alternative. Scott, you gotta bring your band to Philly sometime- I GOTTA see you guys in concert!
B0000041LA|5.0|I bought this as an after thought (it was listed under the &quot;Customers who bought this also bought . . .&quot; section) while buying Prokofiev's &quot;Classical&quot; symphony (which I also highly recommend).  I laid it aside for awhile and forgot about it for several weeks after it arrived, but I left it in my CD changer.  One day, as I sat doing my homework, one of my other CD's ended and I was greeted by a powerful pulsing chord on the strings, which immediately caused me to sit up and take notice.  This was my introduction to Prokofiev's First Piano Concerto.  All five are incredible works, although the First and Second, in my opinion, carry the most weight.  They are light hearted and fun, in full modern style, the one exception being the Second, which is intense beyond belief and makes you wonder how it fits with all the others.  The Fourth and Fifth are especially quirky (the Fourth is written only for the left hand), but a pleasure to listen too.  All in all I couldn't believe what a deal I'd gotten, getting all five of these magnificent works in one set.  Ashkenazy does a fabulous job bringing out the feeling and power behind these works, and, when appropriate, the playfulness.  Don't miss out!
B000002OX7|5.0|It's not my favourite Who album (that would be either Sell Out or By Numbers, depending on how I feel on the day), but Who's Next is very probably the band's best album -- their finest blend of intelligent, searching lyrics, gut-busting rock, passion and humour. It's their best-sounding record, too, and Daltrey's greatest vocal performance. I first got this album back in 1974, and I'm on my third copy now. The bonus tracks are nice to have, but really, they don't add anything (and may in fact take away some of the impact of the original record, by introducing filler where there was no filler before). Forget Pete Townshend's obsession with the Lifehouse project; you don't need to know a thing about Meher Baba or the Lost Chord to become obsessed with Who's Next.
B00003CXBK|4.0|Please do not get carried away by the \\"Star Wars\\" reference on the box. This is NO STAR WARS. To the contrary is a more passive but epic masterpiece.<br />The Japanese track was a great adition, you will notice how sub-par are the english voice-actors(even the Disney caliber ones) when compared to the original voices.<br />But with that aside, this is still one of the best english dubbing efforts of all time! Great cast for a great anime classic!<br />But the Dvd lacks a solid documentary about the process of uncovering this gem! WHy the Disney animators got interested in it? Why this movie took so long to get a theatrical release on the states? All this questions and more are left unanswered.<br />But I guess I might be asking for much! Disney is not a great fan of the DVD format as a \\"learning tool.\\" (They tend to used as a marketing ploy) In the end, the movie makes up for it and the Japanese track we fans pushed Disney to include, is a great satisfaction!
B000002P2V|3.0|Ultimately a mixed bag. There's three wonderful tracks (New Song, Music Must Change and the title track); two almost-great songs spoiled by over-production (Sister Disco, Love Is Coming Down); and one absolute travesty (Guitar And Pen). Entwistle's three songs chart his decline from charmingly black humorous songs to turgid heavy metal. The production by Glyn Johns (finished by Jon Astley) is cluttered and lifeless; the CD remastering improves matters somewhat, but it's still way below his usual standards. Ultimately these songs may have benefited from streamlining, stripping away the stacks of synths and more straightforward performance. What makes this album more than listenable are Daltrey's fantastic vocals (his best since Who's Next) and some of Townshend's most blistering guitar. Ironically, Pete's solo album Empty Glass would tackle this album's obsessions -- adolescent angst vs adult sophistication -- a lot more successfully.
B000050XEI|5.0|This music is intoxicating, hypnotic, addictive...  I've known of Enya for slightly over 10 years now, listening to her prior works with little more than amusing curiosity and novelty.  Hmmm, &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; always sounded dreadfully reminiscent of Andy Williams' &quot;Can't Get Used to Losin' You&quot;.  Nothing special here for me.  But after listening to &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; I wasn't sure if I was experiencing something new and very special or simply that I had missed it all along.  So I went back and listened to the prior work, thinking just maybe my views had changed. They didn't.  Enya has raised the bar with &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;.  Everyone I have played this disc for wants to hear it again and again...  This is the definitive, mature Enya.  A masterwork.
B000002P6R|2.0|In 1981 Pete Townshend was an alcoholic; Roger Daltrey was feuding with new drummer Kenney Jones; and Entwistle was obsessed with heavy metal. Not good signs; but what really sank this record was the recruitment of Bill Szymzyck as producer. Known for his dead-sounding, note-perfect Eagles discs, this was not the man to capture the Who at their spontaneous best, even if that had been possible. The drum sound on Face Dances for a start is unbelievably fussy and unlistenable. Matters were not helped by the choice of material (by Daltrey from Townshend's demos, I believe). There's some great songs here -- Don't Let Go The Coat is a little gem, and Another Tricky Day might have been a classic with a more sympathetic performance -- but there's also crap like Cache Cache and Daily Records. The problem is not the Who trying new styles of material -- some of their best moments (Pictures of Lily or Happy Jack) had been out and out pop -- but this was fluff. The simple fact is that by 1981 Pete was no longer interested in being in the Who. One wishes he'd have left before recording this disappointing disc (but then, one wouldn't have the generally better It's Hard). Once I put Coat and Tricky Day on a compilation tape, I don't think I've played Face Dances all the way through again. The bonus tracks are slight, too.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Warning: a new brand of punk rock....i read a few reviews here and some poeple love the cd and some like the older Green Day much better ...ive been a fan of Green Day since Dookie.  i listened to that cd every day and everywhere and i loved it.  i have all 6 of their cds and i really beleive that all 6 of their cds are different from one another, no 2 Green Day cds are alike but at the same time Green Day have their own style on every cd. Nimrod started something totally new, mostly hard hitting catchy punk songs, but also a few other songs that are different like Good Riddance, King For A Day and Last Ride In. Warning is even something a bit more different...still its the same Green Day. Warning is catchy up-beat songs that everybody loves, some differences in this album 1)billy joe sings more then usual 2)the songs are a bit slower 3)more instruments are used, you could also say the lyrics have more meaning about trust and faith...thats not a bad thing!! the songs dont have as much power and they have an acoustic sound to them, still every song rocks. if you have NOT really liked Green Day, are not a true fan or just along for the ride, then you want to stop now. die-hard fans of the band get this album. the best songs: Minority,Blood Sex and Booze,Waiting and Macy Day Parade. takes a while before u really start to like it but if u are a die-hard fan U MUST BUY!!!
B000009QPO|3.0|What to say about the Jayhawks?  One doesn't want to be cruel because you get the feeling that their intentions were always pure, but there's no getting past the fact that their songwriting skills never quite kept pace with their ambitions, or their loyalties.  The end result is pleasant music (in the same league as, say, the Kingston Trio or Donovan), but nothing more -- certainly not &quot;art&quot;: certainly not Dylan, Parsons, Lennon/McCartney. Don't get me wrong -- you could do a lot worse that the Jayhawks; but you could also do a lot worse than Thin Lizzy or Grand Funk Railroad.  Consider yourself officially warned....
B000056VIY|2.0|Gimme a break. What is this? A Brittany Spears album with extra booty flavor?  The songs on this album put me to sleep. The only song that I enjoyed was &quot;Love don't cost a thing&quot; which I doubt that Senorita Lopez wrote all by herself because to me, her love for puffy was all about putting this amateur album on the market. I lost 20 bucks to the cd store. Hopefully, when Jennifer gets some money off her behind, she can donate it to those poor folks who made the mistake of ever taking up this album off the shelf. I can't sing myself, but I surely know where to draw that line. I think Jenny should stick to acting. I'm quite spent on her lame publicity stunts.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men is an excellent book showing a true friendship between two men. George is the brains and Lenny the strength, they were an awsome duo.  I believe that this book deserves 4 stars, i read it in high school and have read it once more the now that i am older and when u read it a second time you are able to relate to the story.      This book teaches important lessons in life; it teaches the reader that there are many decisions in life you have to make and some may be harder then others.  The choices you make that might effect your life, like the relationship between Lenny and George, two opposite men but have chosen to travel and live together.  Life with a friend that is different from you can become intresting and probably effect your choices.  You look at the choices you make in a hole new view, seeing the reality of life through choices. The outcome of this story ends on a choice that George makes that will probably effect his life forever.
B00004VXF2|1.0|We all do things we later regret. that we are ashamed of, but, in most cases, we don't leave a permanent record (excuse the pun) of that transgression. Unfortunately for Lou Reed (and us), he has left ample and ugly evidence of his immaturity with &quot;Metal Machine Music,&quot; which is nothing more--NOTHING--than a spiteful kiss off to a record company Reed felt was maligning him. This CD is unlistenable, which is exactly what Reed intended when he released it. <br />I can only imagine Reed's condescending chagrin at the airheads spouting off about how great this album is. Grow a brain, people. Or at least some ears.
B000059MEK|5.0|I've had the songs from the internet for several weeks now but I thought it wouldn't be fair to write a review 'till I bought my own copy (the album's just been released worldwide this very morning).<br />I'm not a Daft Punk fan, let's get that straight. I'm not that much into techno-music, certainly not into disco-funk. And I'm NOT giving this album 5 stars because continental (and more specifically French) music became HOT all of a sudden. Don't worry, Madonna knows what she's doing... Vive L'Europe ET les Etats Unis, prenons le meilleur des deux mondes!<br />'One More Time' In Europe we all know this track by heart, young and old: Eurodance with transformed vocals by Romanthony. It's really great but the rest of the album's better. Let's move on, now shall we... 'Aerodynamic' A song that consists of two parts: aggresive breakbeats and a really fast guitar solo with some synths. This track is MASSIVE! 'Digital Love' Pure guitar pop with filtered Daft Punk-vocals, folllowed by devastating breaks. Phoenix meets Supertramp. A 100% FM-summer hit! 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' Filtered (again) disco-funk, but not to worry, their sound is ENORMOUS once again (nice 'contre-temps'). This is a clear stand-out track. Love it! 'Crescendolls' Extremely festive electro-house, a real party-track: a recurring gimmick, background voices with special effects and some filters. A Daft Punk-track like only Daft Punk can make 'em. 'Nightvision' Slow with mid-tempo rythms. It's a nice interlude. 'Superheroes' Pure Muscle Music. A mix of a hard house beat and a californian FM chorus, this is 'Star Wars' goes Disco. Easy but good. 'High Life' Real Daft Punk-voices brought up in crescendo. Simple plan but... MY GOD IT WORKS!!!!! 'Something About Us' Downtempo funk with some more delicious vocals by Thomas Bangalter. It's got a real laid back fancy edge to it. 'Voyager' Tender but firm. A very nice bassline with the usual guitar riffs and an 'ambiance mélancolique'. The Dafts show ustheir music can be subtle as well. It works for me! 'Veridis Quo' This is deep-electro with a sad vibe to it. This is not for the clubs but shows us Daft Punk have a lot up their sleeves... 'Short Circuit' Vintage Electro-funk meets modern electronics. Reminds me of Grand Master Flash (in part one) and the Aphex Twins' 'Windowlicker' (part two). First it SURPRISES, then it SEDUCES. 'Face To Face' The Perfect Daft Pop Song (with vocals by Todd Edwards). Brilliant, one of the best tracks on 'Discovery'! 'Too Long' This is a potential hit single with Romanthony on the vocals, like 'One More Time'. This track is no genious but it really works and delivers... The album ends like it begins: with a sure commercial hit.<br />All in all? PURE GENIOUS, BRILLIANT MUSIC but most of all A TON OF FUN and GROOVY DANCEFLOOR THEMES. Own this album and you (and everyone around you, for that matter) won't regret it. Discovery comes with an exclusive Daft Club membership card, where you get acces to every single new track or remix Thomas and Guy-Man want you to hear. And if that doesn't convince you I don't know what will...
0792845730|5.0|I see RoboCop as one of the truly great sci-fi films--a mix of cool technology, a dystopian future, a basic hero myth, and a thought-provoking commentary. Some people see The Terminator and RoboCop as two sides of the same coin; I'd say RoboCop is the mechanical monster movie with more of a satirical bent--and that's all to the credit of the smart script. Buried beneath Verhoeven's more-is-more filmmaking philosophy are simultaneous man vs. self and man vs. machine battles--but beneath THAT is a scathing social commentary on a future filled with media overexposure and consumerist overload. What a shame the limp sequels ditched the very premise (Man or machine? Human or product? If you take a brain out of the person, can you take the person out of the brain? Or, uh, something like that) that make RoboCop such a genre standout.
B00003CXDG|4.0|Action fans will not be disappointed by MI2. John Woo, director of the John Travolta/Nichols Cage film Face/Off, has done some visually stunning action scenes in MI2.  The plot is simple, but action is the keynote of this movie.  The only problem with the film is Tom Cruise - he is just not an action star.  Note for film buffs: the plot of this film is a techno update of Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious.  Tom Cruise &amp; Thandie Newton take on the roles played by Cary Grant &amp; Ingrid Bergman, while Dougray Scott does the Claude Rains part.  Scott's relationship with his head bodyguard is similar to James Mason &amp; Martin Landau in North By Northwest.  And the producers claim MI2 is an original screenplay!
0393317552|5.0|I found this book tremendously interesting. It tries to answer the question of why, when different cultures come into contact, one will usually take the other. For example, it asks why the Europeans defeated the Native Americans instead of the the Aztecs sailing across the ocean and colonizing Spain.<br />I think the reason that I am so excited about this book is that I actually *learned stuff*. I never knew how or why certain animals or plants were domesticated. I never knew why the &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot; is now just a big desert. I certainly never knew that Madagascar was colonized by people from Indonesia, as opposed to people from Africa. And so on. I you are at all interested in history or geography, this is a book that you will be happy you read.
0792140923|5.0|The power of this film is truly incredible.  Director Robert Zemeckis uses his time-hopping and person-changing ideals that he captured in films like Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  Spanning over 30 years of history, Forrest is literally oblilvious to the changes of America, riding them out as we take witness to his brushes with greatness (3 presidents), and his accomplishments.  Tom Hanks makes Forrest such a memorable character because we believe his character is real.  Probably not until &quot;Chuck Noland&quot; in Cast Away has Hanks been able to recently pull of a live-action role so well (Toy Story's Woody is also well orchestrated, but Woody is a computer actor). This film holds a firm place in my top 10 for a number of reasons, but mainly because it is a reminder of my mom.  I was never like Forrest, I could not run like the wind blows, or my IQ did not register a 75, but it was the type of encouragement and moterly love that Sally Field put into Momma Gump that made her so believable.  Sadly, 8 months after I saw Forrest Gump, my mom passed away due to cancer, on Tuesday April 4th.  To this day, no matter what, Forrest's final scene with his mother still gets me inside.  It is something that will stay with me always.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I viewed the film today for the first time and oh my I must say that this has to be one of the greatest films of last year and truly one of the best of all time. Cameron Crowe is really a genuis, the writing in this film is just phenomenal. I'm young and I must say I am now in awe of all music that came out of the late 60's early 70's. I plan on getting the soundtrak to this film.<br />On to the film. Patrick Fugit is an incredible actor, he has such heart in this film especially when speaking with Penny Lane about how Russell really cares about her. Then Kate Hudson's performance in this film, can be described in one word; AMAZING! I have not seen such great acting for someone as young as Kate in a long time. You really forget that you are watching Kate Hudson on the screen and you think you are watching Penny Lane, and that is what great acting is all about and very few films and actors have the ability to do that anymore. But Kate can! As well as Patrick Fugit. While I was watching this movie, I didnt like of it as a movie, you completely forget while watching it, because the acting is so top notch. Frances McDormand as William Miller's over protective Mom is so great, I love how Cameron Crowe described her &quot;You could have a whole movie just based on my Mom&quot; And really you can. Frances gives one of the best performances of the movie, behind Kate and Patrick, who just hold the whole movie together. Patrick is the innocense and Kate is the heart. If Kate Hudson is not awarded the Best Supporting Actress Oscar this year, I have lost all hope in HollyWood!<br />Billy Crudup who plays rock star Russell is also great, but he has this stigma about him, that just says JERK! Also the fact that he treats Penny Lane like a toy makes you want to hate him even more. Penny is in love with the music, she is there as a fan who is in awe of the music along with her other bandaids. And the fact that Russell and his other bandmates always say it is for the fans, Russell fails to see that Penny is their biggest fan and he treats her as though she is just a peice of trash. But then Russell also has a quality about him, saying please just like me. So I give him credit.<br />The other members are not featured much, but play a prominent role in some scenes.<br />This is really a movie about the love of music, finding your true self and just having a helluva time expeirencing and meeting new people. I encourage everyone to see this film and I promise you that will not regret it. Even if you hate Kate Hudson you will appreciate her just for giving you the pleasure of seeing her perofrmance. Also if there is nothing you find you like about this film, there will always be the music!fails to see that Penny is their biggest fan and he treats her as though she is just a peice of trash.

B00004SCX6|4.0|OK, this album is definitely better than Britney's first one. Apart from a few mistakes Britney made (namely the incredibly irritating dialouge at the start of Lucky, Satisfaction and Dear Diary) its actually good.        Oops!... I Did It Again - the title track off Britney's album is fun and upbeat although not the best on the CD. (8/10)      Stronger - This is a great song! The music is great and the lyrics are clever and sassy. On the whole Britney sings it well.(9/10)       Don't Go Knockin' On My Door - This an OK pop song. At first it sounds a little silly and it needs some getting used to. (6/10)      Satisfaction - I love this song! It's so cool and the beat is amazing. I know people feel its an insult to the Rolling Stones but when we consider it to the mess she made of her last cover(The Beat Goes On) , Mick Jagger should be pleased. Perhaps he and Britney should sing it together? :-) (10/10)<br /> Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - This is another great song, Britney sounds better than she ever has before. The lyrics are also enjoyable. (9.5/10)<br /> What U See Is What You Get - This is very good pop song. The lyrics are smart and the beat catchy. After a verse of this song you can't help humming along. It's right up there with Brit's &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, and &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; (9/10)<br /> Lucky - definitely the best song on the CD. Its one you'll press Repeat for again and again. Brit's voice sounds surprisingly impressive. (10/10)<br /> One Kiss From You - Lyrically this is the best song on the Cd. Its pretty good vocally and musically also. (8.5/10)<br /> Where Are You Now - Britney sings this very, very well. Her best ballad ever. (9.5/10)<br /> Can't Make You Love Me - an alright pop song. Not that bad not really that good. (7/10)<br /> When Your Eyes Say It - Absolutely amazing. This song is sweet, I love the lyrics and the music. (10/10)<br /> Dear Diary - Britney, darling why spoil a perfectly enjoyable CD, with this disaster? Now you know why its hidden at the end of the Cd. (4/10)<br />Generally this Cd is a good one and worth the price. Britney fans don't hesitate to buy it and if you like the released singles give it a try.
0375805613|5.0|My daughters had this book sent to them some 25 years ago by their aunt who lived in Canada at the time, they always found it a thrill to listen to and to take part in.. it was read many time with ever growing groups of children, and it fast became the most favorite book we owned. when my daughters grew up and have families of there own this was one of the first books I tryed to get hold of for my grandson, but sadly couldn't find it in the UK, so when Amazon came avaiable I quickly ordered a number of copies to give to to the family and once again it has become a firm favorite, I am sure it will stay that way for many years to come, I think there should be at least one copy of this book in everyones collection.  &quot;Happy Days&quot;
0786915749|5.0|First of all,  I am a skater and a prep at my school.  Not one you would think to read books... But I play computor games and was into fantasy games like Everquest, Ultima , Asherons Call.   When i was 12 i picked up a copy of Harry Potter and loved it.  Fascinated by (fantasy) :) I heard about dragonlance through a multiplayer game called Asherons call.  So i decided oh whatever... a book I'll pick it up just to read in spare time like after tests and stuff.  So i bought the book.   As my family and I were driving to the beach I started to read.  What I read was amazing... I had never actually wanted to sit down and read a book in my spare time before.. but this book changed all that.  Amazingly this book captivated me..  It is a great tale of friendship and of an amazing world full of Dragons and great fighters.  Even if you are an all blood shooter addict type guy like I was, you would probably enjoy this book.  IT is a great piece of writing , very well written.
6301955595|5.0|Great Show! off beat but with a solid plot. The film implies several extreemly violent acts but actually is not grarhic at all. This is not some silly slasher thing, but a strange psychological deal (If you liked &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; you probably will like this one). Wonderful color and some of the strangest characters that you will ever see out side of a &quot;spaghetti western&quot;. Influences may have come from Todd Browning's (&quot;Freaks&quot;) and &quot;The Unknown&quot; (silent, Lon Chaney/ Joan Crawford). If you haven't seen &quot;Freaks&quot; it's worth it just to see the lovely (born armless Frances O'Connor). Possible that Ms. O'Connor was an inspiration for the mother character in Santa Sangre ?
0345347951|3.0|When told that I was going to have to read a science-fiction book for my English class, I was at first very skeptical. When my teacher passed out the book &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, I started to get nervous. I had never read a science-fiction book before, and I didn't know what to expect.  When I first started reading &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, I was confused. It starts talking about one situation with one group of people, and then moves to another situation with another group of people, and the first situation and group of people are never discussed again. The further I got into the book, the more enjoyable it became. But when I got to the middle of the book, my excitement started to decline and my confusion increased at a fast pace. The last 5 or so chapters were the most confusing parts of a book that I have ever read. While I was reading, I was like &quot;What?&quot; But the very last chapter started to make more sense, but was still very disappointing. I will not give away any secrets of the book, but the ending is not the best.  It is still very hard to believe that this book was written in 1953, because there are parts of it that are so real. But then there are other parts that are very unrealistic. I guess I could say that his is a somewhat good book. I will just say, that if you are forced to read the book, it's not that bad, but unless you are a science-fiction lover, I would not recommend this book.

B00004YYDI|5.0|Whether you view the original &quot;Leon&quot; or the American version &quot;The Professional&quot;, you will be in for a rare treat.  In lesser hands, this could easily have been nothing more than a reasonably good action movie, or worse yet, an exploitation film taking advantage of a highly taboo piece of subject matter, and that being pedophilia.  In Luc Besson's hands, it becomes a small masterpiece.<br />The additional 24 minutes of footage in the original movie version changes the meaning of this film to a surprising degree.  As one reviewer put it (and I paraphrase here), the American version is more innocent, and takes into account American sensibilities (or non-sensibilities, as I like to put it).  The American version is a very good film, but the deleted footage added plot holes while lacking the depth and nuances in the original.<br />Leon (played by Jean Reno) is an odd-looking 40 something year-old man with almost a childlike mind.  He may even be close to being an idiot savant in that he can do only one thing well (actually exceptionally well), and that is killing (he is a professional hit man, and the deadliest of his kind).  Although he can speak English, he cannot read, and since coming to this country has been under the influence of a mafia boss, Tony (played by Danny Aiello) who takes full advantage of Leon's abilities and especially his disabilities.  Tony hires Leon for specialized contracts, but keeps his money as his banker and only doles out a little at a time (the audience knows full well that Leon will never see much of what he has earned).  Leon is a pathetic individual who lives a secluded and lonely life.  He sleeps in a chair fully clothed with a loaded gun within arms reach.  He is an outsider with no social skills, loves only a plant, drinks only milk, and who escapes his brutal and barren reality by involving himself in old, nostalgic movies. <br />In contrast, Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman) is a beautiful 12 year-old girl raised in a drug influenced and unloving home.  She's a young girl who is continually the brunt of her father's anger, often beaten and always neglected.  She is also a girl who, because of her environment, is streetwise well beyond her years.  She escapes her brutal reality by immersing herself into cartoons.<br />The tragic incident that brings these two lost souls together is the murder of Mathilda's entire family (but particularly her 4 year-old brother who she dearly loves) by out-of-control DEA agents led by a truly psychotic agent, Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman).<br />Once this unlikely pair are forced together, they begin to complement each others deficiencies and needs, and this is the heart and soul of this fine film.  Leon as the reluctant protector, actually becomes her guide into the world of killing, while Mathilda, needing revenge for her little brother's death, teaches Leon to read, and ultimately to care, feel, and love.  Is it any wonder that by fulfilling such basic needs, it turns into love?  But what kind of love are we talking about?  Basically, it's the love of a father and daughter, yet there is a seething undercurrent suggesting so much more.  Mathilda easily mistakes this love as being &quot;in love&quot;, and in her limited knowledge, she IS in love.  Leon, meanwhile, denies his attraction for Mathilda to himself, and to her.  Besson handles all this with utmost care and realism.<br />My hat goes off to the entire cast (even Oldman, although his performance is over-the-top, it is extremely chilling).  However, what makes or breaks this movie is the performance by Natalie Portman under Besson's wonderful direction.  Her roll is the key, and she lights up the screen every single second she is on it.  Her big, beautiful brown eyes sparkle with a child's laughter in one scene, then steams the screen seductively in the next.<br />There are so many memorable scenes that there just aren't enough words allotted to describe them all.   Suffice it to say, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat and totally captivated.  Between 1 and 10, &quot;The Professional&quot; gets a marginal 8, while &quot;Leon&quot; gets a solid 9.  Admittedly, this film is not for everyone, especially those who are easily offended either by the topic or the language.  That being said, I don't think you can possibly lose with either film version.<br />So what could make this film a 10?  To tell you the truth, the action scenes (as intense and as good as they were) often took away from the real story (I sometimes wonder what was left on the cutting room floor in lieu of some of these action scenes).  One can readily understand why this was done.  &quot;The Professional&quot; could reach a much larger audience if it highlighted the action.  Unfortunately, we live in a world where violence and death are glorified and love, especially forbidden love, is a topic that most find extremely difficult to handle, or even understand.
B00004RF9I|4.0|It's all about ratings and telling the people what they think they want to see, in Paddy Chayefsky's,\\"Network,\\" a biting satire of television and those who program the beast,  directed by Sidney Lumet and starring William Holden, Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch.  In the world of the television corporate news division of a major network, the prevailing attitude is \\"I don't care what you've done for me in the past, what have you done for me lately,\\" and so, as veteran newsman and network programmer Max Schumacher (Holden) discovers, it's out with the old and in with the new, as Diana Christensen (Dunaway) steps in with some radical ideas of how to bolster ratings, including giving a group of terrorists their own show.  But the boldest move of all comes with decision of the network hierarchy to keep anchorman Howard Beale (Finch) on the air, even after he announces (on the air) that he is going to commit suicide during the next broadcast, which of course, sends the ratings through the roof overnight.  Working form Chayefsky's intelligent, well crafted screenplay (for which he received an Oscar), Lumet presents a scything commentary on the whys and wherefores of the decision making process behind what America watches that is hilarious in it's very absurdity; so absurd at times, in fact, that it is just too close to reality.  And though the situations in the film are exaggerated, of course, it makes you stop and consider that in many cases fact is-- in truth-- stranger than fiction.  It also makes you wonder what the 6:00 newscast you watch every night is really all about:  Is it a conveyance for information, or merely entertainment?  To bring it all to life, Lumet assembled an extraordinary cast, many of whom give memorable performances that are the highlight of the film, beginning with Holden as the jaded newsman who, late in life, is trying to figure out how it all fits together and works.  He perfectly captures that sense of earnest futility and confusion into which Max's life has descended, and the stoic acquiescence with which he resolves it.  Dunaway, meanwhile, pulls out all the stops and turns in a dynamic performance-- her best next to her portrayal of Bonnie in \\"Bonnie &amp; Clyde\\"-- that earned her an Oscar for Best Actress.  She skillfully brings out all of the energy and zealousness of the character, and leaves no doubt about the direction in which Diana's career is headed (that would be up!) and woe to anyone who gets in her way.  She plays it all beautifully, and through her, Diana becomes the very personification of female prowess.  And, not to be outdone by his co-stars, Finch turns in a memorable performance as the veteran anchorman at the end of his rope who adjures his viewers to go to their windows, open them and yell the now classic line, \\"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!\\" which has such a profound effect on those watching that Beale soon becomes a so-called \\"prophet\\" of the airwaves.  It's a brilliant portrayal of a man lost in despair and struggling with a loss of faith in everything he has held sacred his whole life that deservedly won him the Oscar for Best Actor.  The supporting cast includes Beatrice Straight (Mrs. Schumacher), in the role that earned her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, Robert Duvall (Frank Hackett), Wesley Addy (Chaney), Ned Beatty (Jensen), Arthur Burghardt (Ahmed Kahn), Bill Burrows (TV Director), John Carpenter (Bosch), Jordan Charney (Hunter) and Kathy Cronkite (Mary Ann Gifford).  There is much in this film that will strike a chord of recognition with the audience, because it concerns a medium with which practically everyone living in America today is familiar.  In the final analysis, rather than condemning television and the powers-that-be behind the programs, \\"Network\\" is more of a wake-up call-- not only to those who decide what we see, but to those who watch it-- to accept responsibility for what is being served up with impunity and ingested withoutquestion every day.  It's an entertaining, albeit caustic, film with a moral, from which no one with a conscience is exempt.
0671027344|5.0|You ever feel like picking up a book and reading only a few pages here and there just to regain the feeling that you had when you read the book for the first time?  That's exactly what has happened with this book.  It has become comfort food for me.  When I feel a little down or lost I pick it up a and read just a few pages...it's amazing what happens.<br />The novel is addictive, enchanting, heart-wrenching, and beautiful all at the same time.  It is one of the best books I have ever read, and will probably stay in my top ten for the rest of my life.<br />I read this book because it was a gift from a friend.  Since then, I've passed the book around to all my friends, and they read it.  I write each of their names on the inside back cover.  The list is growing rapidly.  I'm going to run out of room for names.  <br />Please buy this book. You will be so happy you did.  It has truly impacted my life.  Amazing when that happens.<br />Love, Seth
B00005A3KS|5.0|When this movie was released in the theatres, T2 was the #1 movie. I loved T2 and when someone told me Point Break was a better movie, I thought they were crazy. Now I own both movies and I watch Point Break all the time while T2 gathers dust. Point Break is about a struggle between a rebellious surfer tribe with chief Boudy (Patrick Swazye), who lives life by their own terms, and 'the system' lead byFBI agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), who wants them to become productive members of society. You're never quite sure whom to rute for. You'll love to love these bad guys. Packed with action and even some comedy ..., this underrated movie ranks among my all-timefavorites. The beautiful beaches with powerful surf, one of the best chase scenes ever (right up there with Raising Arizona's) and high flying skydiving scenes make this movie perfect for DVD. I'm glad the producers have taken the time to create a quality DVD withwidescreen anamorphic picture and DTS sound. Pick this one up when you get the chance, it's a great movie with excellent replay value.
0062502182|5.0|<BR>I checked this book out from the library, but I'm going to buy a copy and re-read it at regular intervals.<BR><BR> I read it over the course of one day, thought &quot;nice fable&quot; &amp; began reading another book as soon as I finished this one. But I found that the lessons contained in this simple story of a shepherd boy seeking treasure, wouldn't be dismissed so easily. They must have taken up residence in my subconscious and kicked up some dust, because my mind keeps returning to the lessons of the story to find new and more subtle insights having formed.<BR><BR> These are lessons that we all know in our hearts, but that we forget as we get wrapped up in the hustle and bustle of our material lives. Lessons about listening to our hearts and following our dreams. Lessons about living in the moment, the transient nature of possessions and the illusion that we can even &quot;possess&quot; something to begin with. Lessons about freeing ourselves from fear and about understanding our lives as part of the energy of the Universe and understanding that everything will work out the way it was intended to. Lessons about trusting in signs, knowing that our lives have a grand purpose and that the forces of the Universe will conspire to help us fulfill that purpose. And the lesson that all of the fortunes and misfortunes we encounter in life are part of our spiritual education, and that it's not the earthly &quot;treasure&quot; we seek that's important but the lessons learned while in pursuit of it.<BR><BR> If you like to ponder the meaning of life, then let your mind and spirit mull over the lessons in this book. It's a quick and enjoyable read that will provide some new insights, or remind you of some old one's that you've forgotten.<BR><BR>
6305327084|5.0|Why isn't Natalie's picture on the cover instead of Rosie's? ....  Too many people refuse to see this movie because of Rosie.  For those, she's not in the movie that much and when she is she's really funny.  However, the real reason to see this movie is for the Precocious Portman.  There hasn't been a tragedy of this magnitude since Romeo and Juliet.  Lines like, 'I just want something beautiful,' are so sad, and then Moe responds, 'We all do,' but unfortunately poor Moe just doesn't get it, as is the case for many men.  Most of the reviews give good appreciation to Willie and Marty's relationship- so I won't dwell on what could have been perfection.  One addition I think most people miss is when Willie's girl friend arrives: Based on his brother bummer and daddy downer's reactions, Willie thinks he's pretty lucky.  Suddenly a solid 7.5 looks a lot better than a 0.0 that his bro and dad are stuck with.  Listen to the song as the brother and dad have excited smiles saying 'she was superb' and waving bye as Willie drives away looking at her like 'this was meant to be.'  The lyrics go 'It's so easy, to be stupid,' which perfectly describes what's going on.  Don't settle for someone who doesn't excite you!  The DVD has a great picture pretty good sound and the best reply value, so it's worth owning.  I just wish they included some extras.  On the back of the box is a picture of Natalie and Timothy sitting together talking.  That scene is not in the movie, but it must be somewhere out there.  Please include it in a special edition.
B00003CXAA|5.0|A real classic film! If u havnt seen it which is unlikly well get it now! There are some great performances by Pacino, Brando and Duvall. If you don't know the story its a tale of a sicialian family living in america and its rise to power. <br />There are some great scenes in the godfather and some very violent ones as it captures the ugly business of crime. A real winner, watch it now!
0345347951|2.0|The request by my english teacher to read &quot;Childhood's End&quot; immediately made me turn my nose up at the book.  I am an avid science-fiction hater!  I don't know that I've ever enjoyed any science-fiction books that I have read.  The thought of reading about outerspace and aliens disguisted me.  As it turns out the book was not AS bad as I thought.  Once I got past the first few explanatory chapters that outlined the plot, I began to somewhat enjoy the book.  Now, I wouldn't say that I just couldn't put it down, but it had become somewhat interesting.  The &quot;overlords&quot; or aliens, didn't seem so much like made-up creatures, they seemed somewhat like humans, aside from the spacecraft of course.  As I began to near the end of the book, I was almost anxious to see what would happen to mankind.  That is when it happened, just exactly the type of endings that made me a science-fiction hater to begin with.  Nothing happend like I expected!!  It seems as thought all this creativity that wat put into the book itself just ran out at the end of the book.  Absolutely nothing imaginative happened, things just dissappeared and the book ended.  Not meaning to give away the ending for anyone, but you aren't missing much.  While the book did keep my interests for awhile, I've fallen back into my science-fiction hater mold.  I feel that this is probably where I will remain!  There is one thing that I'm very interested by, it is how this book was written in 1953!  Aside from the aliens some of the author's predictions in the book, did really come true!  That is true ability by the author, Arthur C. Clarke.  Read the book for yourselves and find out what you think of &quot;Childhood's End&quot; and it's ending.
0375703764|4.0|This book is amazing - and apparently you either love this book or you hate it.  I enjoyed the fact that you are tossed from story line to story line.  It was like reading 4 stories at once.  I also enjoyed his visual writing style.  It was very poetic and it also gives the reader a lost feeling.  I would recomend it to people who enjoy the Griffen and Sabine books. It's written in much the same feel.
B00003CXMG|4.0|Great movie, but where exactly was the &quot;Director's Cut with 30 minutes of never before seen footage&quot; that Amazon has been advertising? My guess is that the whore studio will release that version in a few months, the same way they did with &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and a host of others. <br />My copy of &quot;Alomost Famous&quot; has the same exact movie that I saw in the theater. It contains a 30 minute &quot;making of&quot; feature that I saw on HBO. There are no outtakes or deleted scenes and certainly no extra footage. There isn't even the standard voice-over audio track yet. The buyer needs to beware that this DVD is not coming with everything promised on this site.<br />The movie itself is a classic and worthy of 5 stars, but the DVD is nothing special. I guarantee you the REAL DVD will be released in the near future.
0345347951|3.0|When my English teacher first assigned this book for us to read, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical.  I had never read science fiction before, so I had no idea of what to expect.  From the very beginning however, I found myself being drawn into the characters' lives.  Just like all the characters, I wanted to know what the Overlords looked like, what their plan was, and where they came from.  This book, although it was written in 1953, correctly predicts things that have already come true.  Arthur C. Clarke predicts correctly the pill and DNA testing.  I also thought it was humorous how he thought it outrageous that people would watch three hours of television a night!  After the frist few chapters, the pace really picks up.  I found myself becoming more and more interested the more I read.  I found the concept of New Athens incrediably intringuing as well.  By the end of the book, I was completely involved in Jean and George's lives...I found this book to be a good introduction to science fiction.  It helped get rid of many of my misconceptions on what science fiction is about.  Childhood's End, although not a book I normally would hav read, turned out to be alright.  All in all I would reccomend this book to only those people who are already science fiction lovers.
0060920432|5.0|Instead of attempting to offer the reader a condescending, simplistic recipe for success and happiness (par for the self-help course, it seems), Csikszentminalyi illuminates the processes of happiness in all their heady complexity.  The difference between the conventional style and that of Flow is as that of a shoddy set of directions and a detailed road map.   This said, the book is still very accessible, replete with relavent and engaging antecdotes, careful exposition, and a thoughtful writing style.  The best thing that can be said about Flow is that it excites the pleasurable experiences that it describes!
0375501851|5.0|I'm not sure where to start with this novel.  However, here goes.  I cannot believe that this is a first novel.  The twists and turns in the plot are actually ever shortening circles that all converge in the end.  The characters are funny, sad, ridiculous and believable all at once.  The story takes place in London, but the characters are not necessarily English, but rather third world immigrants living in England, but not really making any effort to become British.  Their stories are at once unbelievable and terribly funny and sad.  This is an incredibly well written, complex, and character driven story that sweeps you along its improbable path in a strangely acceptable way.  A great read!
B00003CXN4|1.0|This movie was horrible and very boring.  There is no plot and the stories do not interact with each other.  The first words out of my mouth when the movie was over were &quot;OH THANK GOD IT'S OVER!!!!!&quot; Do not waste your money on this movie
B000059MEK|5.0|This is quite a record! WHOO HOO I AM RIDING A ROLLAR COASTER WAVE OF EXCITEMENT! I listened to this whole record while driving up and down PCH and LET ME BE ONE TO INFORM YOU THIS IS A GREAT RECORD WITH SOUNDS TO BOOT! I am feeling like its going to be a VERY IMPORTANT record.  It sounds like a sad robot ate a lot of cheese and then sang love songs through a megaphone in a tennis court. People hear the robot and start to dance around him. Then someone accidentally spills some water on him and he is shorting out at random. This makes the bass very powerfull. Then the robot started playing with ringmod around track 12. <br />and contrary to what the reviewer for amazon says its called a VOCODER not a vocorder for gosh sakes... and cher didnt start the &quot;vocoder wars&quot;,  they always have been used and daft punk uses them very well. CRIKEY!!!!!
B000059R8Y|5.0|Clapton is back with a fantastic mix of rock and roll and blues.  The first track, Reptile, even adds a measure of jazz.  This is a CD that is a work of a mature artist, yet with out the pretension that shows in the new work of some artists in thier fifties.  It is obviously reflective of his youth and his roots.  As a result many of the songs on this album have rifts remenisant of early blues and rock classics.<br />His covers of J. J Cale, Stevie Wonder, James Taylor and Ray Charles are particular treats, but as always, his original is material is top notch.
0812505085|3.0|I liked Treasure Island.  I thought it was a good book.  It wasn't what I had expected though.  I expected more violence and characters.  Even though there was many characters in the book, it would have been better to have more.  With more, there probably would have been more trouble getting the treasure meaning a harder journey. If someone ever made a sequel that was more adventurous, I would read it.
B000055ZB8|4.0|This is still one of the best horror movies ever, but time has not been kind to the ending of this old-fashioned nightmare.  These days we expect a huge bang at the end - Nosferatu ends with a whimper.  It's still a great movie, but not quite as rewatchable as Metropolis or even Battleship Potemkin.  The special effects are, for the time, ingenious and creepy, and Max Schreck is a special effect that never ages.  He is probably the most vampiric vampire actor ever, and the best moments of the film are the shots that follow him lurching slowly out of the shadows.  All in all, this movie is not going to scare a modern horror lover, but it has great atmosphere and some classic images.  No vampire film is complete without an homage to Nosferatu, and every horror library needs a copy of this.<br />Technically, this is pretty good for a silent-movie DVD, light-years ahead of the Metropolis DVD.  The picture is mostly clean, if a little murky, and there are 2 good soundtracks on it.  The Silent Orchestra's score is great.  It's my understanding that nobody knows what the original score for Nosferatu was, so it's perfectly legitimate to choose a different score if you like.  I like to watch this one with some old Cocteau Twins playing...
B000002NIW|5.0|This is definitely the darkest album that the Deftones have released to date, just edging out Adrenaline. Really, however, it cannot be appreciated on its own. You should buy all three albums; they're all great (in my humble opinion).
6305090564|4.0|Deep Rising has the terrorists and geography of Die Hard,the boat from Titanic, a few of the characters from Star Wars, the soldiers-vs.-monsters action of Aliens, a creature that resembles a mindless Lovecraftian Old One, a horribly gory almost-dead victim stolen from Robocop, and the classic sequence where the bad guy dies a slow, horrible death because he wasted his last bullet trying to kill the good guy.  Ah, the modern morality tale.  Plus a sense of humour which is really what keeps this movie going.  As you may have gathered, this is a formula movie, but it is done gracefully and never slows down or tries to be serious.  At the same time, it never mocks the traditions of the creature feature, treating every cliche and stock scene with exactly the right respect.  (Unlike, for example, Independence Day, which couldn't decide whether it was a major family feature or a B-movie, or the Mummy, which never made its nasties seem nasty enough).  The jokes are funny, the gore is plentiful enough to turn give seasoned stomaches a jolt, the action is well-framed, the music is creepy, and the ending is FABULOUS!!  However, it's not for everyone.  I've seen this a couple of times with mixed crowds, and I've found it to be one of those movies that will make your best friends look down on you forever - unless they are horror fans.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
B000000H64|5.0|How do they do it?! They HAVE to be the only metal band that can play hard music, yet have these achingly melodic interludes which seem to reach a place other ordinary toothbrushes can not! Every song on this album is addictively good and no matter how many times I listen to this cd, I never get sick of it! (This has been going on for 3 years now.) A metal classic.
B00004YW6I|5.0|PJ Harvey has gone through more incarnations than pretty much any other artist around: vitriolic punk goddess (Dry and Rid of Me); husky, sensual chanteuse (TBYML); techno-flavored diva; and now, all-out rocker. <br />The April issue of Spin (which featured PJ, among others, on the cover) called her one of the 40 best artists working today, and I have to agree. This album showcases a more &quot;at peace&quot; PJ; there's distinctly less anger--although her wit, power, and mastery of emotion have not decreased at all. <br />The same Spin article said the Stories album was PJ's most accomplished work to date, although some fans might prefer &quot;the old, open wounds.&quot; I personally do. The early albums speak to me more than this one does, but that doesn't detract from this album's mastery. Songs like Kamikaze, Big Exit, We Float, and This Is Love transcend easy categorization. Really, there are no bad songs on this disc, although I think the energy decreases some after the first three songs until you hit Kamikaze. <br />Regardless, Stories is one of the better albums released in the last year or two (possibly since Is This Desire? *g*) and it's definitely worth a listen. It'll probably bring more people in on our &quot;dirty little secret&quot; of PJ, which can never be a bad thing.
B000056K04|2.0|Dave Matthews Band is far better than what this CD represents. This is such a let down compared to the bands 1998 studio release. If your a true fan, forget this  album exists and buy the concert DVD that was release late last year.
B000059MEK|5.0|My discovery of Daft Punk is interesting, to say the least... I discovered them for the first time just two weeks ago when I was curious to hear what popular music from Paris sounded like (other than the production work of Madonna's &quot;Music&quot;) and picked up their debut release &quot;Homework&quot; after amazon.com recommendations. So the moment I learned they had a new release coming out, I reserved it in advance, was the first customer at my local music store this morning of its release, rushed it out to the car and practically tore off the plastic with my teeth in my enthusiasm. I had been very impressed by &quot;Homework&quot; and adored the new song &quot;One More Time&quot;, so I was looking forward to what promised to be a lighthearted work of art, a genuine rarity in this current world of N'Sync and Britney Spears. What I wasn't expecting was for this to be such an INGENIOUS lighthearted work of art! Managing to better the experimentation from the first offering, these guys are really mastering this musical language they've been crafting all these years. Influences spanning some three decades as wonderful and diverse as Led Zeppelin, Michael Jackson, Dr. Dre, The Beatles, Prince, Andy Gibb, Brian Wilson and much more can all be heard here, but like all works of genius they are crafted as inspiration for a listening experience which sounds at once both familiar and unlike anything else you've ever heard before. Not a single bad track dots the disc, and personal faves include the lighthearted 70s rush of &quot;Digital Love&quot; and &quot;High Life&quot;, and the boys show us they can even switch direction with &quot;Nightvision&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;. Not since Prince and The Revolution's &quot;Parade&quot; have I heard such a unique and experimental new recording from a fresh act so filled with promise. What will Daft Punk do next as they continue to grow? Well, as long as they keep that strong artistic commitment and special lighthearted senseof beauty their work wears so well, rest assured that it won't be dull!
B000050XEI|5.0|So glad my son gave me this CD to add to my collection.  If you love Enya, this is must!  If you don't have this CD, immediately put it on your shopping list!  I can't tell you which song is my favorite.  I love the all!
B00000FZ1V|5.0|&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was great when it came out,and keeps getting better.With it's pitch-perfect blending of eye-popping visual effects,surreal,Saturday-morning cartoon atmosphere,and deadpan irony,the film really was something different,and has yet to be equalled in all those elements(though &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; come close).Starring Dan Aykroyd,Harold Ramis,and national treasure Bill Murray,the film centers on three scientists who are,er,asked nicely to leave thier positions in a college science department because of thier rather,well,unorthodox theories.Out of desperation,they go into business for themselves as &quot;Professional Paranormal Investigators and Eliminators&quot;.To finance the venture,they put a third mortgage on Ray's(Aykroyd) house--Peter(Murray):&quot;It's O.K.,Ray,lot's of people have three mortages on thier house!&quot;Ray:&quot;But at nineteen percent?You didn't even haggle with him!&quot;So begins a fabulously entertianing ride of outragous encounters and hysterically funny one-liners.This film could contian the highest number of classic quotable lines in history.Everyone has thier own favorites,and mine is when Ray confronts his client-turned-love-interest Dana Barret(Sigourney Weaver) after she becomes possessed by an evil spirit that's taken over her building--Murray knocks on the door,and the usually conservative and demure Barret answers as a demonic,sensual sex-pot--Peter:&quot;That's a different look for you isn't it?&quot; Dana:&quot;Are you the key-master?&quot; Peter:(pause)&quot;Not that I know of.&quot;Bill Murray's comic genious has never been displayed in all it's glory better than in this film,and he gets great support from Aykroyd's amiable enthusiasm and Ramis' drier-than-dry wit.Rick Moranis also gives a great performance as Dana's nerdy neighbor Louis.The duluxe DVD repackaging with all the goodies is very welcome,especially if you're accostomed to seeing the film in the dreaded &quot;pan-and-scan&quot; versions heretofore available,which caused you to miss most of the action.Now you can appreciate the impressive scope and lavishly mounted production in all it's glory.Also nice is the MST3K style running commentary by Harold Ramis and director Ivan Rietman,that is often as entertaining as the film.This edition of the film finally gives this great classic the presentation it deserves.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I have often been intrigued by this multitalented Icelander since her days with the Sugarcubes. Selmasongs is a nice package for the listener who wants a change of pace from the tiring pop music that is so often geared to specific age groups or audiences.<br />Even attempts at cultural and musical format crossovers by many have not impressed me. A country superstar who takes on an alter ego to be a rock star? Ha! Or the artists that you can't tell if they are more inclined to rap or rock-and-roll? I am not awe-inspired!<br />I cannot offer Bjork the quality of praise of those reviews already issued by my predecessors, but I can say that Selmasongs is evident that this star wants to grow as both an artist and creative individual, even possibly at the expense of sacrificing opportunities to go multi-platinum several times over.<br />Perhaps this release will one day go down as a Year 2000 classic counterpart to a masterpiece that was not commercially received at first but yet contained the kind of ingenuity of effectively mixing great harmonies and vocals with orchestrations and other sound effects in the nature of barking animals and oncoming trains to eventually earn praise as being arguably the greatest album in rock history. And I am referring to the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds.
B000056K04|5.0|K, let me start off with a little interjection, how the hell do people get off saying that they are disappointed with DMB.  They make music for your enjoyment and you are DISAPPOINTED with it!?!?!?!  You can like their music, you can dislike their music, but you have no right to be disappointed with their work.  I love this Album, its haunting melodies and masterful lyrics hit me just like every previous album put out by DMB.  DMB continues to make your bones shiver with dark jazzy tones and the incredible range and register of Dave's voice, the new Electric Guitar adds a tangy edge to the previously full bodied Accoustic Guitar, very different but very good.  Every track on this Album is worth listening to and they get better and better as the Album goes on, just like every other DMB Album.  Anyone that says that DMB has sold out needs to go find a large dull pocket-knife and stab themselves repeatedly in the eye, you and I are anything but Dave's peers, so lets have some respect for the man he makes some 'laxin' toons and if that ain't your rythmn then toss the Album, the only one who can be disappointed with Dave is Dave, and as far as I can see there's no need for even a glimmering of that. Rye.
0140366997|5.0|I'd be happy to argue the point, but it seems to me that the four greatest fictional characters of all time (excluding Don Quijote, who's in a league of his own) are : Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and Tarzan.  There are certainly no other characters who are so familiar, so often revived in plays, movies, song, television, and books, nor so often parodied and imitated as they.  Take a look at your TV Guide and there'll be a movie featuring at least one of the four on the air at some point this week.  They are all still just as popular as the day their authors introduced them.  The reason for this is, first of all that they are simply brilliant creations, but secondly that they each in their own way tap into very powerful human fears and aspirations.  Frankenstein's monster and Dracula represent victory over mortality.  Tarzan represents victory over Nature.  Sherlock Holmes represents the ultimate and inevitable triumph of reason over the mysteries of human behavior.<br />Of this quartet, it is Holmes, because he is the most realistic character and because his victory seems closest to our grasp, who resonates most deeply with us.  Realistically, none of us expect to gain eternal life nor to be plopped down in the jungle unexpectedly, but there's a sense in Holmes that, for all his genius, he is really just using the brain power that all of us share better than the rest of us do.  As he tells Watson here, after one of his those classic moments where the good Doctor is stunned by one of Holmes's analyses :<br />  The world is full of obvious things, which nobody by any chance ever observes.<br />Nobody that is except the world's greatest detective.  But the idea that things are just waiting to be observed, and the simplicity of Holmes observations, serves to foster the illusion that the mysterious will yield to our intellect should we merely apply rigorous reason.  For all his foibles and quirks, it is this that makes Sherlock Holmes an aspirational figure.<br />Holmes and Watson are so familiar to us as to need no further exposition.  Suffice it to say that this quintessential novel features many of the elements that made the series immortal : inexplicable doings at stately manor houses, chases across the moors, pea soup fogs, beautiful damsels in distress, and the like.  And if the villain is not the equal of Dr. Moriarity (then again, who is ?), surely this tantalizing intoduction to the mystery is as enticing as any ever committed to paper :<br />  &quot;On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler who made the  discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was  sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the  event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at  the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at  the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in  the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other  footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I  carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my  arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the  ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an  extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. TheFe was certainly  no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was made by  Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the  ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did -- some little  distance off, but fresh and clear.&quot;<br />  &quot;Footprints?&quot;<br />  &quot;Footprints. &quot;<br />  &quot;A man's or a woman's?&quot;<br />  Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank  almost to a whisper as he answered:<br />  &quot;Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!&quot;<br />The reader, if he exists, who doesn't yearn to discover the secret of this gigantic hound may as well give up reading.<br />GRADE : A+any.

0515123447|4.0|Ex-MP Jack Reacher has dropped out of society and is spending his days wandering the American South. All is well until he spots the town of Margrave, Georgia on a map. His brother had talked once about visiting Margrave, supposedly the town where legendary blues man Blind Blake was killed. That's when Jack makes the fateful decision to get off the bus and poke around.<br />Lee Child's books had been recommended to me on several occasions prior to my actually reading one. After months of procrastinating I finally picked this up and was pleasantly surprised to find a real winner. &quot;Killing Floor&quot; is an excellent, suspenseful example of the corrupt town novel (done so well by Ross Thomas, among others), and Jack Reacher is a terrific character. (My only complaint would be that it's a little longer than it needs to be--if it had been pared down some, it would be even more gripping.)<br />You'd never know from reading &quot;Killing Floor&quot; that the author is an Englishman. He has the flavors of America down pat. What a fine debut!  I look forward to reading more from Mr. Child.
B000002JPA|5.0|I purchased this CD based only on the fact that the band had formed at the Berkeley School of Music. I was blown away by the talent of the band, especially the drummer. The music was complex, ingenious, engaging, and improves with each listen. I look forward to listening to more of Dream Theatre. The only complaint I have - one common with many of the CDs produced these days - is that bass part is nearly completely buried in the mix. I can tell that the bass part rocks, but I would like to be able to hear it .
B000059MEK|5.0|This album is commercial, but in an almost satirical way.  Daft Punk is known for humorous music and Discovery continues the tradition.  In a tacky disco-sheik style, Daft Punk rock the dancefloors and the spirit.  Their music is deceptively simple, with raw dirty sounds at times and cheesy arppegietted synth-lyrics at others.  The great big helpin' of filter sweeps is ever-present on Discovery as it was with (the amazing) Homework, though now with a seemingly more soulful twist.  Certain songs remind me of funk-hop bass lines (ala Cameo).  All in all, Discovery is a very pleasing album.  Though Discovery has a different edge than its predecesor, it's every bit as Daft.
B000059MEK|3.0|I've never been a fan of Daft Punk and I don't have their first album, but for some reason I bought their latest &quot;discovery&quot; and I'm not dissappointed. It starts off with the smash &quot;one more time&quot; (which is the best song on the album) and ends with the much too long &quot;too long&quot; (which is about 10 mins long). Discovery is filled with disco infused beats, vocoder effects, and electronic synths. All in all it's a positive, uplifting dance album that's sure to make you get up and dance.
B00004Z4UW|1.0|First off the &quot;fight scenes&quot; are stiff and slow, if you think they are  good then you have never seen good kung-fu flicks, where wire-fu is done right.  Wire-fu is an art, but this is a joke. Also thee gun fights are dumb. Watch the JohnWoo film HardBoiled and you will know what I am talking about.     Second the story has been done a million times before, and everytime it is better than this. The Truman Show, 13th Floor, and Dark City all handle the &quot;None of this real&quot; theory better.          Third the FX are not as WOW! as you think they are, StarWars Ep.I a re better.      Finaly the bad acting, the acting alone makes me hurl
B00003XB8K|3.0|After buying and listening to this album, I must say it is a significant disappointment considering previous Enigma releases<br />I know some people who already reviewed this item may disagree with me, but its my opinion damnit, and I want to express it like this:<br />&quot;Gravity of Love&quot; - yes, this song is absolutely beautiful, and it's a shame that literally no radio stations today play it.  Getting this CD is the only way to having a copy of this tune!  Its quite interesting to listen to such beautiful music rather than today's usual mainstream garbage<br />&quot;The Gate&quot; - this is the very first song, sounds more like an intro to me.  Very much like &quot;Gravity of love&quot;, this song is very powerful<br />&quot;Push the limits&quot; - this is a song that did actually receive some mainstream attention when it was remixed by ATB.  To tell you the truth I've grown sick of this tune by now :-)<br />Now, let me get to the part I really hated about this album.  The male vocals - I mean no disrespect when I say that the guy sounds like a cat choking on a hairball.  Yes, its that bad!  Why couldn't he put those ladies in the track &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot;?  :(  Then of course there's this issue with the tracks being mixed  or overlap into one another.  What is this??  I would prefer  full-length tracks thank you very much.  As for the style of this music - its sort of a crossover between new age with insturmental and some native chantings.  Very powerful at times, but it can also get quite boring at some point<br />So my final statement:  Its a good album, no doubt, but I wasn't so excited about it.  My rating:  ahhhh...
B000056K04|1.0|I love Dylan, Hendrix, the Stones, the Beatles, both Elvises, Graham Parker, Van Morrison, and a boatload of other great artists too numerous to mention.  I have this hatred for Dave Matthews voice that I am surprised to see is not shared by more people.  One would think that anyone who can love the nasal twangs from such varied artists as Dylan and Jon Andersen (not of Yes, but the country singer) should be able to appreciate the screeching, throaty sudden note changes of Dave Matthews, but that is not the case.  Matthews sounds so much like a jackass that I flip the station every time he starts braying, er, singing.  If you like the oversinging of Joe Jackson, or the &quot;whispering as loud as I can voice&quot; of Olivia Newton John, you might like this guy.  Personally, I think a lot of people are being fooled by the Billy Joel or Barry Manilow of the Pepsi Generation.  Please, make mine a Coke and hold the braying to a minimum.
B000059R8Y|4.0|Eric Clapton's Reptile is a mix of blues r&amp;b  rock and folk the slow hand is masterful again the covers of James Taylor and Stevie Wonder songs are very good over all it is a very good cd.
0446677450|3.0|This book puts out some good concepts, and some that can actually make you money, but he really glosses over the difficulties of &quot;techniques&quot; such as incorporation (apparently to deliberately, though legally, protect your assets from lawsuits), dealing with employees (even good ones), finding a &quot;good&quot; (meaning: take care of it and don't bother me) property manager, etc. Also, real estate is not as easy to turn around and sell as he makes it. Further, incorporation does not necessarily make you lawsuit proof if you are essentially the only one in your company. And, stock always seems to be high when you DON'T need to sell it. After all, the point of making so much money is (hopefully) to spend some of it on yourself and others. <br />If he has his Rich Dad's attitude toward the value of employees (pay as little as you can get away with and treat them like dirt), I am surprised that anyone would work for him. He doesn't seem to realize that SOMEONE HAS TO DO THE WORK. Some people LIKE to tinker with cars, make handmade furniture, etc. Not everyone can or should be an investor.<br />He also, and this is important, TOTALLY IGNORES the issue of health care. What do the rich do? Pay through the corporation? In his case, he might have lifetime health insurance benefits through where he used to work. He and other get rich books never get around to this issue, which will affect us all sooner or later.<br />People like him just have a different &quot;job&quot;, which more often than not takes up more of his day than he wants to admit. It may or may not be the type of job that YOU want.  To me, truly &quot;wealthy&quot; means you have so much income that you don't have to even think about it (think trust fund babies jet-setting to the Alps whenever they want).
6304873441|5.0|This is my absolute most favorite movie EVER. The music is SO good and the story is cute. :) AND MOST OF ALL, dimitri is sooo cute. i love him. he's really the cutest cartoon character ever created. But the best part about the movie is that you can watch it over and over and NEVER get bored!! whenever i'm stressed out or upset about something, i can always watch a little anastasia and feel better!! my friends think i'm pyscho for watching a cartoon 50000 times because im 18, but i really feel that cartoons can be for anyone (like harry potter!) ok, i'm going to stop. But honestly, this is SUCH a good movie. I really highly recommend it to anyone. It's even better than Beauty and the Beast (if you can BELIEVE IT!)
B00003CXE6|4.0|I thought they did a pretty good job redoing Rome. I still prefer models, mattes, real set construction-- but these computer renditions didn't look half bad. Usually I hate the computer graphics in movies. <br />The way buildings (palaces, huts, tents, etc) looked inside was real good. I guess the &quot;property department&quot; was responsible for that. <br />Good action movie... especially the opening scenes with the barbarians. The action is the draw for this film-- it's a &quot;guy&quot; movie. Lots of hack and slash, military comraderie, etc.<br />This is Oliver Reed's last movie. He's one of my favorite character actors and does a good job as a local gladiator manager.<br />Joaquim does decent job making the evil Commodus almost sympathetic in spots. <br />Finally, I liked the fact that they presented the ancestor worship/veneration that in some ways was more important to the average Roman than the Zeus pantheon.
B000001E29|5.0|It's dark, cold, intense, scary and very very addictive. Ever since a friend gave me the CD I have a hard time not listening to it whenever I have a spare moment. (I would listen to it at work too, but it's so damn absorbing.) I don't want to duplicate the good things that have been said about the album by other reviewers--most of them I agree with. One thing that I want to point out though is the astonishing minimalism of the music. A great deal is accomplished with few brilliantly chosen instruments (\\"boots\\" are listed as an instrument in \\"Russian dance\\"!) in most songs, and in the album as a whole a great deal is accomplished by intertwining only relatively few musical themes.
068817776X|5.0|This book gave me courage to live my own life more fully. It is a vivid portrayal of breathtaking anxiety lived, day-by-day, in a nightmare world.  It wasn't easy to get into,  hard to put down once I did.  Thanks to a brave woman and author, who has made a great contribution to the &quot;never forget&quot; archives of the Holocaust.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This is a great movie, one of the best.  But this DVD does not include 30-minutes of extra footage, or any kind of directors cut.  It is the same as the theatrical version.  The extras are o.k., but nothing special (not even an audio commentary).
0789723107|5.0|This book covers the real-world issues of web development. Unlike other reference books which only pin-pointing the 'bad' side of certain websites, this one provides you some guides in bringing up a better-than-average webpages, if not the best. Even the book itself was structured nicely in presenting its prominent content - mostly in point form. Very effective for busy individuals. Get it!
6305313687|5.0|I recently bought this movie on an impulse buy, and also a friends recommendation to do so. I was moved by the superb acting and intense story. It is a movie that you will definatley enjoy if you like Ed norton.This story is a very realistic one and any one who is interested in learning more about the way hate is contagious as well as dangerous this is a great movie. I recommend it very highly!
0345347951|3.0|This was not my favorite book that I have ever read.  I am not personally a science fiction type of reader.  I generally stay away from them as much as possible, but since it was required to read I had no choice.  The book wasn't as bad as I was thinking it would be.  With aliens and life on other planets with little silver ships watching overyou all the time kind of seem a little far out there for me personally.  Since the book was written in the fifties, it had some pretty amazing predictions for the future.  Ones that came pretty close to what is actually going on today.  For example with the DNA testing and the amount of T.V. watching increasing.  The people of that time would prabably be shocked to know how much people now really watch T.V. It kind of took me awhile to even get interested in, for me, the far fetched plot.  With another race trying to help humans but yet changing them was kind of strange for me also.  Basically this would probably be a good book for someone who enjoys reading science fiction, but for me it wasn't my favortie.
B000002UB3|5.0|No matter how many new bands come out that try to add something new to rock or how many new bands churn out radio-rock that the Beatles were doing 4 decades before, this album will still shine as the watershed rock album.  <br />Many consider the White Album to be the epitome of Beatle greatness, and while it's still a great album, it still suffers the same dreaded curse of all double albums - filler.  There are no weak links on Abbey road - it's tight, ambitious and fun.  It was a landmark in both composition (&quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;) and production (&quot;Polythene Pam&quot; through &quot;The End&quot;).<br />After writing a bunch of sub-par songs about tax collectors and such, George Harrison submitted 2 of the best pop gems ever put to tape (&quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;).  Sure, there are some songs that aren't incredibly memorable (&quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; and &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;) but they're not as bad as some of the flops on the White Album (&quot;Rocky Racoon&quot; and &quot;Revolution 9&quot;).<br />The most surprising part of all is that they were even able to record this album because, judging by the lyrics to &quot;Come Together&quot;, they were obviously on more drugs than a human body can tolerate.
B000059MEK|4.0|Daft Punk's long awaited release of the new album &quot;Discovery&quot; lives up to the hype it was given.  They're back with a new amped up, hard-hitting disco-house sound.  More voice synths are used, but on full vocal tracks - there is less repitition of voice samples as there was in the album &quot;Homework.&quot;  Although the new disco sound can be sort of overwhelming at times, it is an album very worthwile buying for anyone who has been a fan of Daft Punk's past albums.
B000056K04|4.0|That Dave changes things with EVERY Release. I have been a fan of DMB for about 7 years now, which means I came onto the scene when Remember Two Thingsand the Recently EP were already released. Back then I was exicted to hear about the release of a new album (Under The Table And Dreaming). I was dissapointed when I first listened to it - the live songs were gone, the solos were shortned, etc. But, as all fans that have been around this long did, I came to love it. I think now that it is the gorups best non-live album released.<br />And that's the thing about DMB, they keep changing things up. One day, when you got nothing but spare time or a long car drive, listen to his studio albums in order. You will notice that there are some drastic differences from one album to the next, and yet there are some tracks between them all that are undoubtably DMB (I think I Did It and Mother/Father are the ones from this new album). Keep listening and enjoy the fact that the band changes things up each time.<br />Also, DMB will live and die as a live band. Always has been, always will be. That's where they pick up the majority of their rock hard fan base... so you guys..keep listenig to Listner Supported or Luther College...<br />My two cents, either Crash or Crowded Streets is the worst album. I would give them both 3 stars. Re-listen to some of those songs and I think you hear commercialism there also...<br />If you like Dave, you need this album.
B000059PQQ|4.0|When I first viewed this movie in 1968 I was spellbound.  I watched it again 33 years later on video and I was dumbfounded.  If you liked the Magic Christian or Myra Breckenridge, you'll love Candy.  'Nuff said.
B00004Z459|5.0|Well , what can I say? This CD is truly worth buying. I admit that when I first got it , I didn't bother listening to it because their hit song &quot;One Step Closer&quot; was getting played out fast. About a week later , I listened to a few of the other songs. I loved them all. This is only 1 of 3 CDs in the world i can listen to from start to finish , and might I add , every song now has a Vegas memory inbedded into my mind. &gt;:D
0152023984|5.0|I have cherished this book for many many years. Simply a wonderful read when you need to be reminded of the lessons of inoccence, purity, and love. Perhaps not for the hardened cynic, but if you're still in touch with the child in your heart, Saint-Exupery's style and the sheer beauty of the story can't fail to touch you every time.
B000059R8Y|3.0|Fans who love Clapton for his rock and blues won't find much to like on this release. It's more likely to appeal to an easy listening crowd than to anyone else. True, he does touch on the blues on &quot;Got You on My Mind&quot;, the slow, gospelly &quot;Come Back Baby&quot; (with some nice piano &amp; organ), the old-time piano blues &quot;Find Myself&quot;, &amp; the brisk blues-rocker with a funky edge, &quot;Traveling Light&quot;. The latter is my personal favorite, &amp; sounds like something Mark Knoffler would do. As for the rest of the album, it's dominated by acoustic soft-rock &amp; pop, along with a poor attempt to appeal to the dance crowd with &quot;I Ain't Gonna Stand For It&quot;. Several tracks include annoying background vocals and strings. The album is book-ended by a pair of instrumentals; The title track a Spanish-flavored jazzy tune, and the closer a soft acoustic track. For an artist who's been considered a rock guitar legend for decades, your more likely to hear these tunes in an elevator than on rock radio.
B000059T5O|5.0|I'm not that familiar with Wait's or Hammond's previous work, but this album is outstanding. The songs have a dark, smoky, (even spooky) late-night feeling. Hammond's delivery wisely doesn't try to imitate Waits' distinctive vocal style, and he makes these songs his own. This is the kind of performance you rarely find with cover material - Hammond not only plays these songs, he inhabits them. There are no weak tracks, although I have my favorites: 'Heart Attack and Vine', with those wonderful guitars lurking in the dark; '16 Shells...', where Hammond's vocals somehow conjure up a slow hip-hop groove (to my ear, at least); the gritty gospel-blues of 'I Know I've Been Changed'.  This is highly recommended stuff.
0446677450|5.0|I find this book to be empowering.  It wakes up your senses, your abilities, how you view YOU!  It makes you think ahead and now.  What can I do to change, to be the best?  How can I expand my knowledge on what I really think of money?  YES, money can work for me and not me for it!!!  Trust in the wisdom you've been given and grow!! I am!!!  Expand, Grow, INCREASE in every area of your life, why not start here!!!!

0790729385|5.0|I first saw this film in 1998. In fact that's when I first became aware of it! Being born in 1983, and living in the UK (where this film has been kept hushed for many years) puts me at a slight disadvantage. Anyway, having seen this film is like nothing else that I've experienced before. Everything little thing, every tiny detail and attention in the film is miraculous - just like the storyline itself. I am not religious in any way whatsoever. However, the use of religion within this film is more a symbolic representation of good versus evil.  In all honesty nothing really spectacular happens in the first hour of this film. It is the exorcism scene that is a mini-movie within itself. This is the part of the film which is outstanding. The use of sound, special effects, and the acting is beyond brilliance. The true power of film is revealed within 'The Exorcist'. The whole idea of film and cinema is a mixture of escapism and entertainment. Yet, this film will take you to places you've never been to before - the hellish nightmare of what possession by Mr Satan would be like. The sound effects in the film are wonderful. At one point we hear young Regan's bed shaking like thunder, the demonic voices, the background music and the priest's voices all at the same time - at the same volume (pure genius). Brilliant acting, superb realism and wonderful sound. This is not a film, this is a virtuosic masterpiece of cinema. If you ask me they should make 'The Exorcist' compulsory night-time viewing in jails and prisons everywhere - now that would stop crime! lol.
B000059MEK|5.0|I am extremely surprised with everything you GET with this CD!  The album, first of all, is mastery.  It has that great Daft Punk sound you have grown to love from their debut 'HOMEWORK', while taking it up a few notches in complexity and pure head bobbin / arse shakin power.  You will not be left unsatisfied with this recording.  I am mostly into more underground music than this, but I just have to give mad respect.  Now above and beyond the CD, this thing comes with the Daft Card, witch can be used to gain admission to the Daft Club, an online club where you can download and listen to exclusive Daft Punk tracks, and whatever else they have in store for us.  The quality of presentation I observed while going through the registry process was amazing.  Kudos to whatever team was responsible for putting the Daft Club together, gaining access went smoother than most every other thing I have done online that is like this.  Now I don't like the idea of the software monitoring how many times I play tracks, but whatever, It's still fun.  Brainless consumerism at it's filthy best, this buy will keep you happy and pre-occupied for days.  Have fun, vote Nader, and see you in the Daft Club.
B000059R8Y|5.0|I logged in to write a review, but Steven Stolder's review (see the Amazon.com review above) said it perfectly.  If you love Clapton's other recent work, you'll love this album too.  Predictability is a good thing if you're outstanding, and Clapton is.
B00003CXMG|4.0|It's almost unfair when Cameron Crowe simply shoots album covers from thirty years ago, and you suddenly are reminded how important the music was, and how much fun those days were.  In other words, a nostalgia flick, but a very charming one.  I know there's been much criticism of the lack of horror displayed dealing with drugs and free sex/groupies, but let that be somebody else's movie.  This is a warm, fuzzy memory to dream on.
0792839749|1.0|Well, I'm commenting on the DVD, not the movie.  It's a WIDESCREEN FILM, and with the technology being what it is, what a shame they couldn't have issued the Pan and Scan on one side, and the REAL movie on the other (WIDESCREEN).  Blowing the film up to fill the frame, and then panning and scanning it dillutes the overall image, but worse, reveals the film grain to an extent that it creates a muddy image.  DEFINETLY DO NOT BUY!  Wait for the Widescreen version.
0440178002|5.0|I don't read a lot of historical fiction, but from what I have read, I can't deny that Shogun is easily one of the best. To be brief, let me say that this book is a real page-turner and has lots of very moving scenes. However, the story does have its inaccuracies. Toranaga is the REAL, HISTORICAL Tokugawa Ieyasu. There really was a battle of Sekigahara. There really was a Blackthorne, but I don't know what his name is. Overall, this book is fairly close to history and James Clavell just took the liberty of changing some of the names and some of the way things are. As for the authenticity of the language in the book, I'm not sure, 'cause I don't speak Japanese. I did feel, though, that the Japanese came across as dumb. Where the English came across as superior. Well, sorta. The Japanese certainly had better hygiene and swords. One final thing, if I were you, I would read TAIKO by Eiji Yoshikawa. Yoshikawa is a Japanese author. Anyway, Taiko tells of the events before Shogun. Then read Shogun. Shogun ENDS with the battle of Sekigahara. What's really neat is that MUSASHI by Yoshikawa STARTS with the battle of Sekigahara. So, if you read these three books, you will have a pretty good view of Japanese history. Yoshikawa, by the way, uses the real Japanese names.
0618002251|5.0|In the book &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a Hobbit named Frodo sets out on a quest of extreme imprtance.  He is to destroy the master ring, the ring that could give one man all the power of Middle-Earth.  He leaves with his Friends (Merry,Pippin, Samwise and meets his friend Gandalf along the way)  No other Writer could have put more detail into this book than J.R.R. Tolkien.  He makes the Characters come alive!  This book is the First book i have ever been Sad to be over.  When you finish reading the Lord of the Rings you will be wishing that J.R.R.

B000002LND|5.0|I love this album. For some reason when I am having a rotten day listening to Madonna makes me feel better.I used to have it but my Walkman ate my tape so I am going to buy another copy. I LOVE THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION ALBUM
B00003CXE7|5.0|Wonderful action, great characters, perfect musical score, what else do we need?  The DVD only adds to the movie's greatness, with the addition of commentary, behind-the-scenes video, and more.  Sure, this isn't exactly the most historically accurate movie ever made, but it IS a wonderful bit of fiction, sure to satisfy the most hardened action lover, with enough intrigue and romance to fill the needs of others, too.<br />As an avid &quot;Romanophile,&quot; I have some issues with the portrayal of Rome as merely a blood-thirsty population of savages, plus numerous inaccuracies in staging (I even found myself trying to see how they solved the problem of canopies in the Colosseum). Still, the movie, as a whole, sucks you in, and suspends even the most scholarly disbelief (even knowing that the armor is injection-molded resin ...  This is what epic Roman stories SHOULD be like.  Of course, what more do I really need to say? See the list of awards it won? 'Nuff said.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Like many, I read the book before the movie came out. Despite the bad reviews for the book, I think it is better than &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; Harris' writing is so eloquent and beautiful that it is quite easy to get past the lack of plot-development (i.e. the last 30 pages: Beautifully written but the story was lost). The movie, however, was disappointing. What was captured in the book was lost in the movie. The performances in the movie were good, but it seemed to move much slower than the book. I'd recommend to everyone to read the book, at the very least, then maybe, see the movie.
0345347951|2.0|I do not particularly enjoy science fiction, so I wasn't very trilled about reading this book for class.  This book, written about the future, had several prophesies that I can see happening, but overall, I found it very far-fetched.  Already the world watches more than three hours of TV each day, but I cannot see aliens coming to Earth in the foreseeable future.  I do not believe that there is live on other planets, and I certainly don't think that another race would come to help the human race reach the next step in evolution (especially because I do not believe in evolution.)  I don't think that we shall ever as a race reach a Utopia, because so much violence, hatred, and evil goes on in the world.  I found the ending to be quite pessimistic.  It sounded like an ending of humans, even if Clark meant for it to be a beginning of a new stage.  Clark made it sound like it was a coveted stage to reach, but it sounded dismal to me.  Overall, I disliked the storyline, but I must give credit to Clark because he made it kind of interesting.  He kept baiting the line with some new information that made you want to know what the Overlords would look like, or what their purpose was.  I wanted to keep reading simply to find out how it ended, although I found the end depressing.  It is not a boring book, but I just didn't agree with Clark's point-of-view.
B000002URV|5.0|Incredible harmony, sucking you into their fantastic world of music... turn down the lights, lie with someone special in your arms or just by yourself... flow away with the music to the Enigma's world...<br />For those who liked the harmony and melody of Enigma, I would also recommend Manu Dibango's album &quot;Gone Clear&quot;... [...] if you do a search you should be able to find it...
B00004XQ83|5.0|Well, I'd felt a bit strange playing the same album over and over, enjoying each piece as much as the next. After seeing the other reviews, I'm surprised we don't heard a bluegrass chorus whenever we open our windows.  It is outstanding!  I would like to mention the Soggy Mountain Boys, too, I think they've done a super job with 'A Man of Constant Sorrow'.  I enjoyed hearing the three different versions of the same song, too!  Great, Great, Great!! Also enjoy, 'I'm in the Jailhouse Now' and 'O Death' is definitely haunting.
B000059R8Y|2.0|Poor Eric. The man has made so much money that he seems to think that he can afford to sacrifice his artistic integrity and still maintain credibility with the fans who have admired his rock and blues efforts for 30 years. Who knows, maybe he can. He sure suckered me into buying this album. The meandering cocktail jazz of the opening track &quot;Reptile,&quot; the &quot;lite rock&quot; of the cover songs--this all adds up to little substance. Is this the same guy who played in Derek &amp; the Dominos? He seems to be more in tune with Jackson Browne, Elton John, James Taylor, and Leo Sayer than Muddy Waters or Buddy Guy. <br />This is appropriate material if you don't feel like being challenged as a listener. In fact, I hope this isn't an example of Eric challenging himself as a player. If so, he has lost it completely. If you are new to Clapton, forgo &quot;Reptile&quot; and point your browser to the recordings he made in the 60s.
0764005685|4.0|You can call Phenomina all the words in the book in the 1st hour and 30 minutes.  Silly, baddly acted, dumb, unscarry and has a  paper thin plot but the last 1/2 hour is like a knockout punch. For those familiar with his work it is like he takes the last 1/2 hour of Suspiria and crunches all the tension down to 15 minutes.  The only bad thing is getting past the 1st hour and 1/2, but don't worry, the ending is killer(like in most Argento movies).

Overall, I disliked the storyline, but I must give credit to Clark because he made it kind of interesting.  He kept baiting the line with some new information that made you want to know what the Overlords would look like, or what their purpose was.  I wanted to keep reading simply to find out how it ended, although I found the end depressing.  It is not a boring book, but I just didn't agree with Clark's point-of-view.
080017948X|5.0|Bill Murray just might be the finest comedic actor out there.  He is exceptional is this comedy about a day that repeats itself over and over and over again.  <br />The real beauty of this movie is the soft touch it is given toward the end.  Too often comedies try to just rest on laughs without much notice given to the story.  Not so with Groundhog Day.  This is a must-have DVD.
0684853523|5.0|I have to admit something up front:  my favorite part of Stephen King's books is the &quot;Author Note&quot; section.  I've always enjoyed getting a little picture into his mind, or where the story came from, or how this idea blossomed into a full-fledged novel.<br />Well, ON WRITING is one long &quot;Author Note&quot; section, and I loved it!<br />He starts out with his life, and he tells his story with his trademark humor and candor.  It wasn't always pretty for little Stevie, growing up with a single, less-than-fully-employed mom.  This book shows how those experiences shaped him and his fiction.<br />King's candor is shined on everything in his life, including drug and alcohol abuse and his recent encounter with a speeding mini-van and the recovery battle.<br />It also gives us a window into the King marriage.  Tabitha doesn't get as much publicity as her husband, but this book makes it clear that they are indeed partners in life.  She obviously captured his heart as a college boy, and owns it to this day. <br />After telling his personal story, King shares some insights for writers.  This is not a college text book, though. King is up front that he is sharing ideas that work for him, but they won't work for everyone.<br />I love his analogy of story as dinosaur bones...it's already there in your mind, you just have to dig for it and uncover it.<br />Reading this book, you sense that King doesn't take himself to seriously.  You sense that he'd be a fun guy to sit down and have a cup of coffee with, to chat about baseball.  You also sense his intense dedication to his craft, his passion for telling you a story.<br />This is an outstanding resource for writers, but perhaps even more meaningful and valuable to King fans.  It's an &quot;Authors Note&quot; that you won't want to put down, and you don't want to miss.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Talk about hip! Talk about fresh!! Talk about your biting social commentary!!! It doesn't get any better than this!!!! I mean, when have you ever before seen surburbia protrayed as a hotbed of hypocrisy and neurosis? Military men as homophobic repressed gays? Drug-dealing and -using adolescents who're really, deep down, pretty cool guys, if a little eccentric? Middle-aged men drooling over ripe young honeys? A homosexual couple who're the only well-adjusted people around?<br />After my second viewing, I've concluded that AB is a brilliant parody of PC values made by sly social conservatives. Viewed thus, I give it a gazillion stars.
B00004YW6I|4.0|This album is about love, where Is This Desire was more about confusion and loneliness and To Bring You My Love about utter despair. I miss the more experimental programming on this album, but it has a sonic diversity that is very seldomly seen these days on a pop-album. She seems to emulate her style every time she releases a new album, and maybe in that sense her style is growing up. A very atmospheric and beautiful album. It makes me want to go to New York!
B00004XQ83|5.0|See this movie. Now. Turn off your com and go. It was a pleasant viewing from start to finish. I am one of the ten poeple on the planet that could not stand all the attention Fargo got. It was OK, but jeezus, calm down  everyone. When we walked out of this movie we went to the music store in the mall to get the soundtrack, but it was either sold out(not likely at that point) or the sleeve was there with no cd's 'cause the shipment was expected but not there. 3 more stores in Santa Monica. same thing. I began to panic. We drove out to westwood and double parked in front of some student run bohen=mian record shop. My girl went in and came out after a few minutes with a cassette of the prized joy. She said the cd's were out and this was the last tape. We put it in immediately and will never be the same. P.S. why'd they snub Clooney at the Oscars?
0553573403|5.0|Just when I thought there were no more great Epic Fantasy's out there, I came across George R. R. Martin's wonderful novel.  This has to be the best series I've come across since the original DragonLance Saga.<br />Martin's strength is his ability to develop a wide range of characters.  Unlike the characters of most fantasy novels, the inhabitants of Martin's world are varied and numerous.  There is the incestuous and powerful Lannisters, the Noble and Courageous Starks, the rebellious Greyjoys, and the exiled Targaryans (just to name a few).  However, just when you think you have someone figured out, you find out something new about that character, some twist to his or her personality which shows just how ingenious Martin is.  In this, the first novel of the series, he establishes a precedent of killing off characters YOU thought would make it to the end, which adds a bit of danger to this series (something not found in most novels).<br />The plot itself is an intricate one, and I will not give it away.  Suffice it to say that civil war is looming and the only question is when will it happen, not if.  Just as in his talent for creating 3-dimensional intricate characters, Martin is a master at weaving a plot of such depth and intricacy that the reader is left breathless.<br />If you like epic fantasy and GREAT writing, along with numerous twists and turns in the plot, then this is the series for you!
B000059MEK|5.0|Daft Punk &quot;Discovery&quot; is a very good album! It's mixed DISCO, 80's, and FUNK music together! All the songs are great! Especially ONE MORE TIME, HARDER BETTER FASTER STONGER, and SHORT CIRCUIT!!!!!!!! If you really like this album I recomend EIFFEL 65 and MINIMAL FUNK and DEPECHE MODE!
B00000273P|5.0|I won't repeat what others have already said, more eloquently than I could. What I will say is that I've owned this CD since it came out in 1990 and I just purchased the new Prefab Sprout Collection on-line, but while I was at it I purchased a second copy of Jordan: The Comeback because I realized I couldn't bear to ever be without it. Yes, I know that CDs aren't supposed to wear out, but what if it did? What if I lost it? What if my dog ate it? How could I live without this gorgeous, lush music? Now I will have a copy in reserve, oh joy!
B00000AFFF|5.0|In the thousands of recordings I own, I never looked for much out of the music.  Music was merely for music's sake, lyrics were there to tie the instrumental passages together.  Then, I bought this album.  I have never been moved so much, emotionally tugged until I heard this record.  Burt provides the arrangement, and EC provides the voice.  Right from the get go, &quot;In The Darkest Place&quot; pulls you in with its sad, yet hopeful lyrics.  The vocals, almost dry of reverb, are present in the mix, so every vocal nuance is picked out, unwashed.  If you love &quot;So Like Candy&quot; from EC's &quot;Mighty Like A Rose,&quot; this is your album.  The softer, touching side of EC.  Don't miss it.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Terrific adaptation of Peter Benchley's novel has a great white shark picking off swimmers off Martha's Vineyard. After a young lady is attacked by a shark late one night, the mayor (Murray Hamilton) and the city fathers want new police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to keep quiet because \\"we need summer dollars\\". Brody reluctantly goes along until the shark attacks swimmers in broad daylight, ending the cover-up. Enter young oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), who hopes to at least study the shark before killing it. But the shark situation soon turns desperate and they page professional shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw). Quint was a U.S.S Indianapolis survivior who hates sharks on a personal level. Quint readies his boat to hunt the shark accompanied by Hooper and Brody, who fears the water but goes along out of a sense of responsibility. Spielberg delivers some terrific suspense scenes but wisely never goes over the edge. Never has a movie made people fear the water like this, and twenty six years later this movie hasn't lost any potency. The 25th Anniversary edition includes a well done documentary with interviews with Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary, and producers and crew members. Outtakes, deleted scenes, and theatrical trailers are included. Great bang for your buck here. Highly recommended.
B000002I99|5.0|With the Alice Cooper group on permanent hiatus,Alice gathered together a top notch group of musicians(many of whom had worked on Lou Reed's opus,BERLIN).In a Canadian studio with regular producer Bob Erzin and new songwriting sidekick Dick Wagner, Alice set about creating a horror concept album.What resulted was the tale of Steven,who is being driven mad by his nightmares that just may turn out to be reality .Here is a rundown of the tracks:<br />WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE : Superb opener.A creepy mixture of a Broadway show tune and straight ahead rock.The horns on this track enhance the atmosphere.Dick Wagner's descending guitar at the climax of the song sounds like a crawly thing scuttling down a wall towards you.<br />DEVIL'S FOOD - Anyone who still says that Alice had lost his hard rock edge after listening to this song should have his/her head examined.I wish I could get my hands on a copy of the longer version of this song.<br />BLACK WIDOW - Vincent Price lends his gloriously evil intonations to the proceedings;seven years before a certain megastar ripped off the concept for THRILLER.Song attains the sound that Alice would later use on the RAISE YOUR FIST AND YELL. You can imagine a giant black widow spider sitting on a throne.<br />SOME FOLKS - A soft shoe shuffle for the demented.This is the Coop in white tie and tails;turning into a werewolf in the choruses.I've loved this album since 1975 and I still don't get what this song is about.It is cool,though.<br />ONLY WOMEN BLEED - A whole new side to the Coop;a song decrying domestic violence and neglect.Perhaps Alice's best ballad,and a song for which he should be remembered.It surprised a lot of critics when they first heard it.<br />DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH - Another anthem of rebellion,in the vein of SCHOOL'S OUT or ELECTED.Alice also takes a pot shot at teen idols ;notably,Donny Osmond(to this day,Donny wears it like a badge of honour!).This should have been a bigger chart hit than it was.<br />COLD ETHYL - A combination of I LOVE THE DEAD and REFRIGERATOR HEAVEN.A cheerful romp about about Alice's love affair with a Girl who doesn't say(or do)much(of anything . .hint hint).<br />YEARS AGO - Steven  has a conversation with himself.A eerie, demented fairground feel to this track.There are also people talking in the background in a language I don't know.Perhaps it is backwards taping?<br />STEVEN - Steven fights his nightmares.NIGHTMARE has a gothic horror feel to it;STEVEN is a prime example.Lumbering,hard rock backing with piano.<br />THE AWAKENING - Steven realises he has done something wrong.Drums,strings and keyboards dominate the song's mix.<br />ESCAPE - Steven now knows he has got to escape his nightmares,but realises that it may be all to late.Staight ahead rocker,with lyrics that mirrored Alice's situation at the tme(the endless touring,the alcohoism).Classic ending: Alice babbling,&quot;I gotta get outta here,I gotta get outta here!&quot;(a reference to BALLAD OF DWIGHT FRYE)<br />NIGHTMARE is the all time Solo Cooper classic;the yardstick that all other Alice Cooper albums had to measure up to.It proved that Alice could make it on his own without the other members of the Alice Cooper Group.It also proved Alice right in increasing the theatrics (not reducing them,as the remaining ACG members wanted).To all novice alice fans,I say that nightmare is the first solo Cooper classic to get your hands on.There is not one duff track on this album.put on this album,close your eyes  . . .and experience the nightmare.REMEMBER THE COOP!
B000005RT8|1.0|Paul producing such crap is beyond anyone's imagination. Except for Waterfalls this album should never have been recorded. But there was worse to come. Try to listen to Macca's Firemen album. Paul, with and without Wings, has produced quite a number of very good albums so I think we must consider those two albums as the mistakes made by a great musician.
B000059MEK|5.0|Most Cds but today are bought for the 2 or 3 &quot;good&quot; songs on an album.  This CD, however, contains more than 7 extremely good songs!! Thats more than half of the songs! If you liked Daft's origional album &quot;Homework&quot; you should love this.  I recommend it to all.<br />---Check out: Aerodynamic, One More Time, Cresendolls, and Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger---
0345347951|3.0|All I have to say is that I am not a huge sci-fi fan, so this book did not appeal to me in any particular way. For the genre of literature that is is, I suppose that it is worth while to read if this is what you like.  The beginning of the book reminds me of the movie Indepedence Day but after the intial opening that is all the resemblence that it had to the film. The idea that the Overlords remained at a distance from the human race until they were sure that they would be safe from persecution was a good idea. They have the appearance of what we consider in our everday life to be the symbol of the devil. In other terms they look like what we as a people consider to be the root of all evil. This book aslo adresses the evolution of man, and the idea that we will later evolve into something other than what we now know we are. This is an idea that commonly conflicts with the ideas of everyday religion in today's society, and may offend some people to the point of disgust. I am not one of these people but if you are i would not recommend this book to you. This is just my own personal opinion!
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is the BEST CD i have heard in a long time.  The guitaring is simply amazing with excellent drumming to back it up.  Billy Corgan's unique voice goes perfectly with the varying moods of the songs.  I love how they worked in the string instruments in &quot;Disarm&quot; to create a beautifully sad and anguished sound.  There are some incredible guitar solos that I can rewind and listen to over and over.  There are no bad songs on this CD and they are not all the same.  I highly reccomend this CD to anyone who has even slightly liked and Pumpkins song.
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austin is the first author that I have ever read all of her books and this is the first one that I read. I fell in love with this book and I have never found another one that quite compares with it's imapact. Maybe I am a hopeless romantic but i believe that things like this could have happened, and might still happen now! I mean you really never can tell. For example, in the beginning the main character meets the person that is to be her husband later in the book, and their intial meeting is not one of desriable happenings. Elizabeth sees Mr. Darcy as a arrogant and rude. He in turn sees her in the beginning as plain, except for her eyes, but he later developes feelings for her which mature throughout the novel. On her side the feelings mature as well....
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Pay no attention to the preceding review.  &quot;Making Movies&quot; is, in fact, the best slab o'wax that DS ever produced, with apologies to their first effort.  &quot;Les Boys&quot; is just about the only throwaway track on the disc (I question its placement as the final song on the album), but at least it's a song with a sense of humor.  Every other song on this album is excellent, from the now-classic &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; to the slamming &quot;Solid Rock,&quot; to the writhing &quot;Skateaway.&quot;  No emotion??!!  How about &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; or &quot;Hand in Hand,&quot; which was apparently written by Mark Knopfler with his then recently-departed brother, David, in mind?  Roy Bittan's piano is the perfect counterpoint to Knopfler's guitar, and Withers and Illsley hold it all together in the rhythm section.  If you select only one DS album, this is the one to buy.
B000059RL3|5.0|The title says it all. First of all, this is the best ever issue of &quot;The Best Soul Record ever made!&quot; The deluxe packaging is so beautiful, the great photos, notes, lyrics; the previoulsly unreleased version of the album is phenomenal in its vibe and feel. Some say they do not see the difference (VIBE magazine), well they are insane. Close your eyes, compare and tell me there is no difference! I was shocked by that review. <br />Fans will really enjoy reading the notes while they listen to it. The live show on Disc 2 has Marvin-obviously uncomfortable with performing live-yet so marvelously in control of the mood, the songs and the crowd. <br />The extra outtakes and single versions really complete the album. You can see how Marvin played with Motown (especially with the early fade on the single version of the title track).<br />You will love the digipak/slipcase packaging, which could not be any nicer. See the other related release: Peter Frampton's, Frampton Comes Alive, Blind Faith's self titled debut album and The Wailers' &quot;Catch A Fire,&quot; which is due out this month. They are all (well, I didn't get The Wailers yet) impecable. I cannot wait to see what the next batch of Deluxe Editions will be.<br />Universal/Motown seem to have taken a step away from the &quot;let's just make money&quot; philosophy, to &quot;Let's please the fans (and still make money)&quot; !!!!
6304711905|2.0|This is a standard Hollywood action movie, but it has to be respected for what it is. It doesn't try to be anything more than this, and if you don't ask it to be, you probably won't be disappointed. It has some good action, good acting and makes everyone feel great about the legendary western hero Wyatt Earp. But to call it the greatest western of all time? I don't think so; not when compared to films such as Clint Eastwood's &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;, or John Ford's &quot;The Searchers&quot;. Sure the cast is well put together, and the acting is relatively good for the performers involved (Come on Kurt Rusell stars and who doesn't love him in &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;? Although it can equally be said who doesn't loathe him for deciding to make &quot;Breakdown&quot; or &quot;Tango and Cash&quot; *shudder*). Even Val Kilmer does a respectable job, which is saying a lot for the guy. The time period looks authentic enough, except maybe everyone looks a little too clean and glossy for the old west, as if they just stepped out of make-up and wardrobe (which they did). Although I'm still trying to figure out if the moustaches everyone wears are so obscenely fake that they are utterly brilliant, or if they are just so fake that you just have to laugh and accept it.<br />The one liners in this movie have to be praised and are really the most entertaining part of this movie. The scriptwriter must have had a blast coming up with the lines for this flic. If you don't find yourself smiling deep down inside when Kurt Russell utters the most contrived words in the whole movie, &quot;Tell 'em I'm comin' and hell's comin' with me&quot;, then I think you've lost your ability to realize the effect that these words are supposed to have on you. I dare you not to laugh during the slow motion shot of Russell wading through water as gunmen are firing at him while he screams out &quot;Noooo!&quot;  <br />If you are looking for a fun action flic to make it thrugh a boring Sunday afternoon, then you've found a great one right here. Invite some friends over, make some popcorn and have a great time watching Kurt posture, pose and recite.
B000059R8Y|5.0|i was not thrilled with my last clapton purchase[from the cradle].i don't like it when eric or any englishmen try to sound like they are from mississippi.but this new &quot;reptile&quot; is crawling king clapton!!except for a few lapses,he sings like eric clapton,a great compliment.his guitar tone is the best i've heard him get since the 1970's.some critics have called this too easy l. or commercial.they know not.this is a just hatched classic,pick one up,crack it open,put it in your pan...it won't sizzle or burn it'll just sort of smolder all over ya...lookin' up at ya with a bittersweet smile....i think eric has found a little piece of mind ands this is his way of sharing it.thanks..you reptile you!![p.s. billy preston's the cherry on top!!]
B000002HAF|5.0|If there is one album in the world that will drive ANYONE crazy it would be this one.  The Pixies may sound like just a bunch of disorganized noise but there is actually something incredible to their sound.  Their mix of wailing and sometimes eerie guitars make their music sound like an impromptu jam that just happens to be very well polished.  Kim Deal does a great job on the female vocals in an almost sedated sounding way while Black Francis (or Frank Black)intermittently screams and howls out lyrics in spanish.  Their sound gives the listener the feel that the music is just plain raw in a good way.  Their sound is artistically and creatively unique.  The Pixies are like that local band you like to go hear play at your favorite bar down the street.  All of the Pixies albums are incredible in their own way.  I was hooked years ago after hearing one song.<br />I love the howling lyrics in &quot;where is my mind?&quot;  and the drums escalate to a point you think you are sitting right next to them in the studio then drop to a brilliant calmness.  There aren't many ways to explain this group...at least that I can think of right now!  I am truly amazed by all the music they have put out for their fans over the years.  There isn't a single song I don't like.  This group teeters on an experimental sound but with a rock/punk attitude.  If you haven't added it to your collection you should now!
B000056K04|4.0|The problem with most DMB fans is that they think they are something special, like they have discovered something that nobody else knows about.  Get with it, 10 years ago you may have been a member of that fraternity, but Dave and his band have solidified themselves as mainstream musicians, like it or not.   I just bought the CD today, (I live in Brazil and we get stuff here a little later than the US) listened to the whole CD twice, and thouroughly enjoyed nearly every track.  I especially liked &quot;Fool to Think&quot;.  As far as I am concerned, Dave left his smoky bar days behind with Crash, which I feel still remains his best work, and probably one of the best compilations ever released.   While the sound is different, less accoustic, less dreamy than some of his earlier work, it is better than 99% of the garbage you hear on the radio nowdays (see Britny Spears, NSync, Aerosmith, etc. ad nauseum).  I also own literally everything he has ever done, and will place this CD alongside his other discs without the least bit of hesitation.   Unfortunately guys, DMB was &quot;discovered&quot; a while back by hoi polloi, the secret is out, and we have to share him with everyone.  But I don't think he &quot;sold out&quot; as one reviewer claims.  I think he tweaked his sound a little, maybe succumbed to his producers requests, and voila, &quot;Everyday&quot; emerged.   All in all, I like it....
B00003CXMG|3.0|I didn't get a chance to see Almost Famous in the theaters, so when it came out on DVD, I immediately rented it.  The story is fun and there are some fine performances by Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Jason Lee and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  However, I thought the characters played by Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand were extremely annoying and definitely not worthy of the Oscar nominations they have received for their performances.  I think Cameron Crowe must be friends with Goldie Hawn and agreed to get closeup after closeup of her little girl Kate so that she can become a star based on her beauty.  But she doesn't do much for the film in my opinion (the same goes for former Oscar winner Anna Paquin, who plays one of Kate's fellow &quot;band-aids&quot;).<br />I also thought that since the character played by Fugit (Billy Miller) is essentially Cameron Crowe himself, he pretty much has portrayed himself as a perfect child with few faults.  I find it a little hard to believe.<br />Overall, it was a good movie, especially if you enjoy the great music that is part of the soundtrack.  But, it isn't &quot;classic&quot; material.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona came back with avengence on this album.  With more upbeat songs then &quot;Tidal&quot; and still wonderful ballad type songs like &quot;love ridden&quot;.  I think she lets herself be a little more free on this album by expressing her anger in songs like &quot;Fast as you can&quot; and &quot;Get gone&quot;, but never goes out of the realm of tastefulness.  She's proven herself once again to be an incredible wordsmith with a beautiful voice and a amazing musical ability.  This album was best of 1999 as far as I'm concerned!
0380799006|4.0|Contrary to what one reviewer wrote, this is not the *only* book on parenting you should read. I'd recommend Faber and Maslish's other books, How to Talk so Kids will Listen..., and How to Talk so Kids Can Learn... I give this book four stars, simply because I've given the others five stars each, and I wanted to show that you should perhaps read these books first.<br />I found this one in the library, somewhat desperate at a time when my two-year old was regularly trying to pinch and scratch my newborn baby. What to do? It felt awful. I clutched Siblings Without Rivalry to me like a lifebuoy.<br />Did it help? Emphatically, yes! There is tons of helpful material here, especially the stuff about helping children to express their feelings appropriately, and the advice to treat children uniquely rather than equally. I was worried that the authors might just rehash what they said in How to Talk so Kids Will Listen..., but they don't. The format is familiar - case studies, cartoons etc, as is the general approach to life, but the content is a real development.<br />I have to admit that some of the book is less relevant when one of the siblings in question is still a young baby. But I'm glad I read it when I did. I'll be coming back to it in the future.
B000002AH7|5.0|I learned about this recording while watching the Ken Burns series on \\"Jazz\\" on DVD. I've got it now and have been listening to it continuously.  It reminds me of many things.  It is spare and Minimal like much of modern art (Miles Davis was also quite a good modern painter).  Yet the Latin musical elements are definitely there as well with the modern art, right there making this album a very unique combination.  The Burns' film said women are huge buyers of this album and I can see why.  It is a very emotional recording, very romantic yet the potential for melancholy and sadness is there too. The cover image of Miles is of him being the matador to a charging bull but it is quite clear that he is the universal idealized lover as well. It is hard to believe this album was recorded over 30 years ago because it sounds so fresh and new.  OTOH, have I been hearing music like this made recently?  Of course not.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0061020710|5.0|Adventure. Fantasy. Humor. Those are the key words that come to mind when thinking of _The Color of Magic_ by Terry Pratchett. This book starts off with the meeting of Rincewind and Twoflower. Rincewind is a failed wizard who lives in the big city of Ankh-Morpork, he is scruffy, skinny, and pessimistic. Twoflower is a tourist, the Discworld's first and only. He has glasses, is rich,an insurance salesman, and incredibly naive. He also has a camera and magical luggage, which are extremely rare in this fantasy world. They meet up and through a series blunders they end up burning most of Ankh-Morpork down, but that happens a lot. Through their travels they ecounter such characters as Hrun the Barbarian and his talking sword. They find dragons, that only exist if you believe in them, they are held hostage in a mountain palace, they fight tree people, they fight ancient beasts in ancient temples, they go to the edge of the Disc (and fall off), encounter some seriously crackpot scientists, and more. All of this is seriously intriguing adventure, mixed with an equal amount of humor. Think Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but funnier and with  more action. This is the first book of about two dozen set in Discworld. Discworld is a Disc of land, hundreds of miles across, that rides on the backs of four giant elephants which stand atop a giant space turtle that's bigger than the Disc, Great A'tuin (sex unkown, that stumpls Disc philosophers everywhere). They also don't know where the Turtle is leading. The second book in the series is _The Light Fantastic_, which continues where TCOM left off. Here we are back with Rincewind and Twoflower and the Luggage, and back at hilarious adventures. The Light Fantastic is funnier than TCOM because you've already been introduced to the characters and to Discworld, so there's more focus on adventure and humor. These books are cheap and joyfully read, enjoy!
B00000G3PA|4.0|I like some comedy thrown in with my action. I like some reality in there too. I think this film accomplishes both. From the beginning Willis' character is identifiable and worth watching. Affleck adds in his own charm and who doesn't love Billy Bob?<br />The action from this film is excellent, filled with explosions, suspense filled dialogue, and even some gun shooting fun. There is plenty of comedy to keep it light, and enough of that sappy stuff that my wife cried... twice. It's a fun move, well worth watching and well worth owning.
B000002UQJ|5.0|Paul McCartney's Off the Ground is a melodic masterpiece with well thought out lyrics, with the possible excpetion of Biker like an Icon.  McCartney runs the gammet in this one.  He calls on the excellent licks of former Pretenders guitarist Robbie McIntosh, who himself has some excellent solo work.  He also relies heavily on the production and recording help of master keyboardist Paul 'Wix' Wikens.  Hamish Stuart is wonderful in his blatant cloning of McCartney's voice.  Newcomer Blair Cunningham on Drums is steady and hard hitting.  Linda does her usual best to create that atmosphere that can best be heard in Band on the Run.  This album is unique because it is the first album since the breakup of Wings to incorporate a complete band.  McCartney has picked some of the best and it can be heard.  Much of his other solo work is almost too McCartney.  We here the influence of McIntosh and Stuart but we are not overwhelmed by them.  The title track is uplifting and well-layered.  Looking For Changes is a great raucous rocks song that takes us back to the middle of the 70's.  You can almost here the Laurence Juber, Denny Laine guitars.  I like this albm because it is not overproduced and it is not underproduced it is just right.  McCartney does a good job of making the tunes flow. It seems that there is a natural progression from such well played and masterful songs like I owe it all to you to the somewhat pessimistic Elvis Costello co-written numbers like The Lovers that Never Were.  McCartney gives us a much-welcomed rocks surprise with Get out of My Way.  I can hear Chuck Berry.  He also ends us off with what will turn out to be a classic in C'mon People.  McCartney rouses us to our feet in this piano orchestra laced anthem.  I can definetely hear John Lennon.  Just when you think that it is all done McCartney goes back and gives us a snipet of an experimental tune Cosmically concious.  It is like the Beatles all over again.  Paul again gives his best.  I just wish that the critics would take a closer look and see the beauty and maturity in this album.
B00004RFFI|3.0|This is an ok movie.  We all know people went to see the special effects, not the lack of acting or a good story about the characters.  It is a good DVD with extras on it.  Good to hear Van Halen music in the film.
B00003CXMG|3.0|Don't get me wrong; I love this movie.  I thought it was the best film of 2000.  ...  The cut seems identical to what I saw in the theater, and there are no deleted scenes included.  The only important extras are a music video, a behind-the-scenes making-of special, and Crowe's original RS articles.  Also, this is a 1.85:1 transer, not a 2.35:1 transfer as some sources claim.  So there you go.
0553579908|5.0|George R.R. Martin is a wonderful author. I would have to say that his work ranks right up there on my list with Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind.  I will say up front that if you are easily offended then do not read this book.  As with any good book, there are evil characters.  Martin goes in depth into all of his characters personalities, including their flaws.  Murder, incest, and treason play no small part in this series. <br />The plot is intricately entwined.  There are six different factions fighting over the control of the Seven Kingdoms.  It's a free-for-all, with brother fighting against brother, princesses in disguise, knights plotting treason against their lords, and every man declaring himself king over this or that bit of land. I have to admit that Tyrion Lannister, AKA The Imp, is one of my favorite characters in the book.  He's small and malformed, but he's got a caustic wit and genuinely cares for the people that are close to his heart.  My only problem with this book was that it was so long.  Which I do not mean in a bad sense, but in the sense that I wanted to know what happens to everyone at the end of the book that was still hundreds of pages away! You really need to have the time to sit down and get into this book or you will not enjoy it too the fullest.
B00003CXMG|5.0|The Academy Awards will be for not. The best Picture of the year was not nominated. I saw all the films with the exception of Chocolate. This film was beautiful. Its was done to perfection, and is one of those rare films that allow you to escape to another time. I rate movies on a simple scale....Bad, okay, Good, and never want it to end. This I never wanted to end. Excellent film to own and watch over and over again. The sound track is one for the ages.
B00004U5SC|5.0|My family and I were in Jackson Hole, Wyoming the year that this movie was filmed.  We drove down into the valley from Victor, Idaho and later shared the opening scene with &quot;Shane&quot; as he entered the valley.  I have seen this movie many, many times and have most of the dialogue memorized.  I am 62 and have shared it with my kids and grandkids to the point that they refuse to watch it with me again.  (They secretly love it but not two to three times a month.)  It is magnificent and probably means more to me personally because I was a kid who walked and rode all over Grand Teton National Park and the Jackson Hole area for years during the early 1950s.  Watch for a white truck which moves from left to right in the very distant background as Shane approaches the ranch and the boy.  It is very near the time when the boy is looking through the deer antlers.  I never saw this vehicle until I watched the video on a 50&quot; TV.  Just an interesting thing that George Stevens ignored or didn't see.
0140186409|3.0|The first book on my summer AP English reading list came highly recommended, and I was excited about reading it. However, as I read more and more, I grew tired of fate's relentless assault on the Joad family.<br /><br />  The book contains oodles of sex imagery, to the point I worry about Steinbeck's sanity while he wrote the book. An example of imagery run wild is given in chapter 5, where tractors and farm equipment are described as &quot;raping the ground methodically&quot; and many other sexual references. It's a TRACTOR for God's sake!!!! Continually Steinbeck dwells on sex whenever he can draw a metaphor.<br /><br />  Another problem I have with the book is the constant bad luck of the Joad family. Murphy's law is proved countless times as every possiblility of good fortune is systematically destroyed. I believe if the book were three chapters longer, there would be no surviving Joads to write about.<br /><br />  In short, while I agree the plot is rather solid, the book is a depressing saga of a family's misfortune in a time when countless other families were experiencing hardships. I recognize the historical importance and the statement this novel makes, but if I had had the choice I would not have read this book. It took me a week to get over the depression and disgust of the human race that The Grapes Of Wrath instilled in me.
B0000029AP|4.0|Most people will buy this album solely because of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; but there is truly more to this album. Besides the title track, classics like &quot;Adam's Apple&quot; and &quot;You See Me Crying&quot; show the band progressing as a rock powerhouse of the 70s. While not as good as the album before it(Get Your Wings) or their masterpiece after it(Rocks), this is a work certainly not worth missing. It's an essential part of any rock collection. It shows the band jsut before they reached their mid 70s peak. Plus, everybody loves &quot;Walk This Way.&quot;
B000059R8Y|3.0|This is EC at his reflective best, but does not reveal the guitar virtuoso that made him legend. It's Clapton Light. It's an enjoyable listen, very accessible, but does not venture into new territory.
B000000OSO|3.0|I love Aerosmith as much as the next guy, but to give this album anything more than a fair review would simply be wrong. True, &quot;Livin on the Edge&quot; and &quot;Cryin&quot; are amazing songs that capture the band at their peak. Even &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; and &quot;Amazing&quot; have their redeeming qualities. &quot;Flesh&quot; is also an interesting experiment. However, they can't carry the load for the rest of the album. Although those songs are wonderful, there are 14 tracks on this album and 10 of them range from fair to borderline suck. <br />This is simply what happens when a band overproduces an album. They spent too much time recording, stretching their experimenting so far that they lost that spark of energy that comes with the early excitement of playing a song. <br />It's an interesting period in the band's life so it's worth purchasing. But in the end, it's hard to say it's not the worst album they've released since they jumped on the wagon for the pop-inclined(&quot;Permanent Vacation-present).
B00001U0GQ|3.0|I saw this movie about six months before buying it on dvd and man was I ready to sit down at watch it again. Upon trying to show this movie to my girlfriend for the first time we both noticed that we could barely here anything. What is the problem here? You would think that with surround sound that you could here it. But no. No matter what the movie is outstanding. A real guys movie. Full of adventure. So if you can get by the sound, or lack of, then i suggest getting it. If not, then i guess you need to wait for a better dvd to hit the market.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin park rocks so much.there cd &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is by far the best cd I own.The best songs are number 1 &quot;papercut&quot;,obviously number2 &quot;One Step Closer&quot;,number 4,5,6,7,8,and 9.4.&quot;points of authority&quot;,5.&quot;crawling,6.&quot;runaway&quot;,7.&quot;By myself&quot;,8.&quot;In the end&quot;,and number 9.&quot;A place for my head.I totally suggest you go out and buy this cd.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I'm disappointed to see that both of the posted &quot;Reviews of the Day&quot; happen to ignore the music on this CD and instead focus on criticizing the opinions of other reviewers.<br />There is no doubt that the Beatles were an above-average pop band. They released some great work (Abbey Road) as well as some sub-standard work (Mystery Tour).<br />Now for the review of this CD: It's a quasi-representative sampler of their catalog, falling short because there are no tracks here that weren't released as singles. Oh yeah, I'm old enough that I saw all of this happen.  Athough now it's legendary, back then it wasn't that great. 3-stars.
0790729628|1.0|Directors Cut is NOT a cut above!<br />I always love to get the directors cut of a movie because you get all the scenes put back in that the studio cuts out.  Mostly because they only want a movie to run two hrs. and they can turn the audiences over quicker or they want to be \\"politically correct!\\"  I look forward to the scenes that are missing and detract from what the story is all about.<br />Alas, this is one time the studio was right.  The theatrical release is so superior to the Directors cut that it is an embarrassment.  With the voice over you get the feeling of what is on the mind of Deckard, sort of like a Bogart movie.  You feel like it is a Sam Spade character and helps with a more in depth view of the character and what he is thinking.  I have no idea what the director was thinking, but it was not about telling a story.<br />I have seen the theatrical release many times, well over 300 times and I can still watch it with the freshness of the very first time.  I have seen the directors cut three times and on the third time I feel asleep it was so boring.  I was shocked that one of the best science fiction movies ever made was so bad; I could no long watch it.  The directors' cut is one of the best examples of a director gone wrong.  Thanks to the studio for realizing the potential of this science fiction classic and making Mr. Scott add the voice over.  Bravo!<br />I am sad to say that for once, the studio got it right and the director got it wrong!
B00003CXMG|4.0|Don't get me wrong, &quot;Almost Famous&quot; was hands down one of the best movies of the year.  However, the film's director, Cameron Crowe, is planning to do a Special/Collector's Edition DVD as soon as he finishes filming &quot;Vanilla Sky.&quot;
B000059MEK|5.0|This cd is just plain awe-inspiring. It is some of the best techno/electonica/dance that I have heard in a long time. The beats are great, and the voice loops are equally as great.   Among the best of the songs on this cd are, of course, the hit single &quot;One more time&quot;, &quot;Superheroes&quot;, and &quot;Face to Face&quot; I personally did not enjoy Daft Punk's homework album (with a couple exceptions) but I would whole-heartedly reccomend this album to to anyone that enjoys the genre.
0807014265|5.0|My copy of Viktor E. Frankl's book is dog-eared through constant re-reading. Never has such a short book had such a long-reaching effect on my life. The story of his survival against formidable odds in Nazi concentration camps may be compared with other great survival stories and stories of people with extraordnary handicaps who make their lives a resounding success. I never understood how they did it. And now I know and I feel inspired because I know. They gave their lives meaning, and worked on that every waking moment. Some aspects of logotherapy do, as one reviewer notes, sound a bit like reverse psychology. But if it works, who cares about the label? I'm cynical about self-help books and self-styled gurus but Dr Frankl and his book don't even belong in that genre. The Los Angles Times is right: &quot;If you read but one book this year, Dr Frankl's book should be that one&quot;.
B00000K19E|5.0|WHAT IS REALITY? IF YOU ARE A STUDENT OF EASTERN RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY, THIS MOVIE IS QUITE A HELP TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS &quot;MAYA&quot; OR &quot;MARA&quot;. I HAVE BEEN SEEING THIS MOVIE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND EVERY TIME I FIND THE ANSWER TO MISSING LINKS IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF REALITY. THE BEST SCENE IS WHEN NEO VISITS THE ORACLE AND SHE ACTUALLY TELLS THE TRUTH IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY WHICH LATER MORPHIUS CLARIFIES WITH NEO THAT YOU LISTEN TO WHAT YOU WANT TO LISTEN... AND EXACTLY IN THE SAME WAY YOU SEE AND UNDERSTAND IN THIS MOVIE WHAT YOU WANT TO.<br />WHENEVER I AM RELAXED I PUT THIS MOVIE ON AND EVERYTIME I GET SOME INSIGHT.
B000005ALN|5.0|Older has got to be the best album that George has ever produced to date.  Since i was bought it for my birthday many years ago its still one of the most played albums on my stereo.  Older contains the Uk singles Jesus To a Child, Fastlove, Older, Spinning The Wheel, Star People and You Have Been Loved.  George is a leader in the music world and many people have copied him and so will many more, so i hope that his next album he will be as individual as he was on this album
0486408434|5.0|This was one of the first magic books given to me.  This (along with Expert Card Technique, the four Dai Vernon booklets, Greater Magic and the Vernon Revelations book) was the basis for my study of Card Magic.  Unfortunately, card magic is not a skill that can be learned by reading alone and these books only show you the basic structure.  Find someone who understands card technique and take some lessons.  Then find a rehersal audience (bar magic is good for this) until the timing, patter, control etc. are complete.  This book is a great companion for learning.
031286504X|5.0|When most of us imagine vampire lore, we often connect the word immediatly to novels such as Dracula, by Bram Stoker, or The Vampire Chronicles (Interview With the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, The Body Thief, The Vampire Aramand, etc.), by Anne Rice. Novels of the vampire have entirely based upon the lore originally set by Bram Stoker. Matheson offers to us a new view of the vampire and how they came to be.  The year is 1974, Robert Neville is the last surviving man on Earth after a plague had swept over the world obliterating the entire human population and reforming it in to a planet where the vampire is the dominant race on Earth, the human an endagered species. Every passing day, Robert Neville battles against the creatures that stalk the night growing garlic or creating stakes. Every night he is forced to drown out the calls of the vampire's from the comfort of his home fighting his very sanity as he loses himself in his drinking.  One must admire Matheson for the development of the vampire. As most authors attribute it to some form of ancient evil, Matheson places it upon a biological mishappening. Anyone who shares interests in vampire literature most purchase this novel. It is perhaps one of the greatest vampire novels of the 20th century. It is a pity that the novel is roughly only 200 pages.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have not read very much science fiction.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  For details, see all of the reviews below...
B000059R8Y|5.0|If &quot;Pilgram&quot; showcased Eric Clapton's voice maturing, and we know the last 30 years featured his guitar, on &quot;Reptile&quot; both come together impeccably. It's the culmination of the best of &quot;Unplugged,&quot; &quot;Riding With the King,&quot; and all the years of great music he's given us.<br />Now it's not the hard-driving guitar of Layla; he plays acoustic more than (or at least &quot;as much as&quot;) his electric guitar, but there's still blues and rock in here. What's great is that there's so much more. An almost Brazilian samba! Stevie Wonder. James Taylor. I don't know what radio station will play this: easy listening? classic rock? jazz? But I can't stop listetning to it.<br />The ensemble cast of musicians are perfect: Billy Preston, Curtis Mayfield's Impressions.<br />I'd be surprised if this isn't nominated for a Grammy.
B000002OX5|5.0|&quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; is one of the Who's most daring and melodic albums, yet it also showcases everything that was great about the band. Pete Townshend is one of Rock's greatest lyricists and his tongue-in-cheek humor is splashed all over this disc. The album plays like a 60's British pirate radio station broadcast, right down to it's hilarious public service announcements scattered between songs. The songs here are criminally underrated, from the tender &quot;Our Love Was&quot; to the harder-rocking &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot; and &quot;Armenia City In The Sky&quot;. &quot;Mary Ann With The Shaky Hands&quot; is a typically great Townshend song rife with sexual innuendos and &quot;Odorono&quot; is a fabulously funny ditty about body odor. This album ranks second only to &quot;Tommy&quot; in my book. An essential disc!
B000000W5P|5.0|It was summer 1978 and I was a ninth grader who only spent his allowance money on Kiss, my rock gods, But then came this incredible album by a group I had ignored for years. Yes I was into the Stones, via some hand me down scratchy copies of their mid-sixties classics (still favorites). I peddled my yellow banana bike to the local department store and returned with Some Girls, an album constantly played on radio at the time. I listened to it every day for weeks and all the tracks grew on me, even &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot; (which eventually became my favorite track) which at first I thought was the only dog, with a weak vocal from Keith. Great albums are like that, the part you originally least appreciated, just hits you one day.&quot;Miss You&quot; is great funky dance rock that ranks with Blondie's &quot;Heart Of Glass&quot; Rod Stewarts &quot;Do Ya Think I'm Sexy&quot;, and Kiss' &quot;I Was Made For Lovin' You&quot; as the greatest rock/disco crossover records of the period.&quot;Beast Of Burden&quot; ranks as one of the greatest anthems in their entire catalogue. &quot;Shattered&quot;, &quot;When The Whip Comes Down&quot;, and &quot;Lies&quot; offer a snarly punk twist. &quot;Faraway Eyes&quot; is a great country flavored ballad. This record has it all including great cover art that is better appreciated on vinyl than CD. Some Girls is actually, in my opinion the last truly great album the Stones recorded.
B000006TRV|5.0|&quot;We came in&quot; are the first words you hear on the epic double album. They're spoken over some quiet music that suddenly turns into the first loud chords of In The Flesh? that introduces to Pink Floyd, both the band and the fictional rock star that goes insane over the course of the record, building an imaginary wall that shuts him off from the rest of the world. The relaxed rocker is one of the Real Songs found on the album, not just short snippets of filler used to illustrate the point of the story. As the chords of Flesh? fade away, in comes the short piano ballad The Thin Ice which flows into the clasic Another Brick In The Wall, Part One (the radio one is part two) after a bizarre guitar solo. These three tracks represent The Wall: no pauses in between songs and blending loud rock with soft ballads seemlessly. Rather than describe all 26 songs, I'll just mention some of the highlights. Of the real songs, All Another Brick In The Wall Parts,  Mother, a woonded accoustic, Goodbye Blue Sky, a dark ballad with a cheery melody for the title line, Young Lust, a rocker, Hey You, a slow accoustic song, Comfortably Numb, an amazing ballad, In The Flesh, Run Like Hell, a song you'll swear you've heard before with it's jangly guitars and rock beat, and The Trial, a Crepy song where Pink prosocutes himself within his distured mind while chanting eerily &quot;Crazy... I am Crazy....&quot; Another thing about this album is it seems like one (well, two) long songs. Proof of that is a guitar riff that constantly appears out of nowhere, especially on Disc Two. Buy this album, ignore the high price and enjoy.
B000000W5B|4.0|Many Stones fans are quick to dismiss this record saying it totally stinks or is a lightweight item in the Stones catalogue. I totally disagree. This is an album that brought me back to the Stones in the early seventies(although I didn't have a lot of interest again until Some Girls);I was then and always will be more of a fan of the Brian Jones era band. Of course there are the obvious known radio hits &quot;Angie&quot;, and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, but I like the darker, more obscure, introspective tracks on this one better. &quot;100 Years Ago&quot; and Keith's &quot;Comin Down Again&quot; are actually my favorites. &quot;Sivertrain&quot;(originally penned for Johnny Winter, who recorded a version) is good rockin' blues, and &quot;Star Star&quot; is the Stones at their bad boy best.
014028009X|5.0|This book was an absolute joy to read.  Bridget Jones is a character that is so easy to relate to. This book is the type that is interesting from the beginning and stays that way through the end. I deeply recommend this one to anyone in their 20's or 30's!
B00003CXMG|3.0|First off, Almost Famous looks and sounds just as good it as it does in my memory of seeing it way back in August. It still holds up really well and stands out as being one of the best films to be released this unsteady year. Also, the inclusion of several Rolling Stones articles written by Cameron Crowe are available for reading or browsing in full, which provides some nice background and kinda lets you piece together what bands are being cobbled together in the story of the fictional &quot;Stillwater.&quot;<br />The problem is, the DVD is advertised to have 30 minutes of deleted scenes, while the DVD itself doesn't mention the 30 minutes and doesn't have any additional footage, unless behind the scenes footage and clips from the trailer count. <br />Crowe has been interviewed about the disc and says that he will be putting together the original 4 hour cut of the film, entitled &quot;Untitled.&quot; So, if you're getting the disc for the deleted scenes, which is my main motivation, hold on, because there will be a monster definitive cut that will far exceed anyone's expectations. <br />but, if you can't wait, there's enough greatness in the film to merit buying it and enough interesting tidbits in the supplemental stuff to warrant it. But if you're a completist and have to have the Criterionesque bells and whistles version, this will only let you down.
B000059MEK|5.0|I Just bought the record today and I can't stop listening. After their excellent/classic album HOMEWORK, they again delivered a master piece! The timeframe moved a bit from late 70's to the early 80's, but don't worry it's all still funky!! 14 instant classics!!...We'll be hearing most songs in the clubs soon, when the DJ's get their hands on it.<br />Personal favs: 'High Life', 'Crescendolls'...the rest will soon be favs too, just have to hear them a few more times!!<br />Great extra is the 'credit card' you get with the album..to enter the [...] site...To bad only PC download software for now.....but Daft-'we-love-Mac-'Punk will soon fix that....<br />Already best record of the year for me!!
B000059TEP|5.0|I doubt very much if very many people have not heard of this movie. If you haven't, welcome back from the Moon and boy are you in for a treat! One of the greatest Date Flicks of all time, this movie is MANDATORY SEEING as a couple, especially DVD with surround, the lights low, the scented candles on, and plenty of Kleenex! Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore play roles you have never seen before, as does Whoopi Goldberg. The range of emotions displayed are breathtaking, and many scenes will make you have tears in your eyes.<br />Yes, it is a moving story, one that will make you cheer and will make you cry, but in the end, it will leave something behind in you. The story is original, fast paced and well crafted. You not will not get lost in this movie, and the timing is perfect.<br />This is the movie that re-made the Righteous Brothers &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; hit for them a second time. This song is perfect for this movie, and delivers the added puch to the scene it is in.<br />If you have not seen this move - SEE IT! If you have a DVD, this is mandatory for any collection. Is this for children? It is in my opinion too intense for under 14. This is a modern love story, and should be seen with the one you love or intend to.<br />In DVD Format, the soundtrack surrounds you and adds something that you can't get from network TV - and un-interrupted. It is a vital part of this movie<br />A &quot;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED&quot;
0783235666|5.0|Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren along with Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette in a very scary, Hitchcock thriller.  (Jaws makes you avoid splashing happily in the ocean; this film makes me look at the &quot;large gatherings of birds&quot; on phone lines differently, I like a hat) When nature runs &quot;afowl&quot; of everything we know about our favorite pets and their cousins.  Once they attack you, they just don't stop and your house won't even keep you safe..excellent special effects; some real birds, some fake and at times, it's hard to tell. Poor Tippi wasn't too happy playing Melanie Daniels, most of her shots were real birds.  People trapped in a familiar environment, with unfamiliar terror, just what you need for an afternoon on the couch, feeling safe and cozy; just cover your parrot.
B000056K04|2.0|For Some Reason, dave matthews now thinks that his traditional 15 minute jam songs, extensive solos and sounds are &quot;boring&quot;.  As a result of this atitude (most likely provided by the new hollywood producer, Glen Ballard) Dave has changed the whole sound of the record.  Daves lyrics and voice help keep this album from beiong blow-torched by traditional DMB fans.  The first thing that a lot of people noticed about the album is that Dave is playing an elecric guitar.  Also, the music is mixed in short, 3-4 minute songs, the drums, bass, woodwinds and violi are mashed together to create a wall of sound that is different from the classic individualality of the instruments.  This is by far, the most mainstream pop sounding album that weve ever seen.  I personally think that the band shouldve released the Lillywhite cd which was composed with all the songs that the band successfully toured with in the summer of 2000.  Hopefully the guys will realize that they have a huge fan base to play to and that they dont really need to change sound for more audience.  If youve never heard the band, this cd is NOT an accurate depiction of the group, if you are a fan, youll be surprised.  I should also say that as i review this cd, i am comparing it to the other 8 or 9 DMB albums that have been released, not to pop music today.
0553579908|5.0|In A Game of Thrones we were first introduced to the Seven Kingdoms. We met Joffrey, Robb and Robert. This time around we get a look at the other contendors as well as the old ones. That's right, we get to see Balon, Renly and Stannis, in what seems the neverending quest for the Iron Throne. But in this case, never ending is a good thing.<br />We also get two new viewpoints on top of the seven remaining from AGoT. Davos Seaworth is a once smuggler and Theon Greyjoy, the funny, miserable and other things son of Balon. Both of these new characters are wonderful additions and both have some of the finest, funniest and original chapters.<br />Trust me, if you thought AGoT was great, then read this one. It is by far the strongest of the series.<br />For those who haven't read AGoT, get it now, or may the Other's take you.
B000051VWW|3.0|OK let's get one thing straight,I am glad Sade is back. However,as I checked out each track,I kept waiting for something more than I was getting to happen; it never did. The songs,for the most part,are well conceived;the production is above par and the arrangements tend to be bland overall. The redemption here is the voice of Sade.Lovers Rock did not deliver variety in instrumention and the fingers of the bassist sliding over his strings was distrubingly noticeable.Sade has more to give, I'm waiting.
B0000542DJ|5.0|great DVD, best I've seen. Deleted/extended scenes are pretty long, and also have director commentary. Check out the exclusive Gary Oldman &quot;Oswald speaks from the grave&quot; scene. Alternate ending, Colorado businessman scene, and more. If you like the Fletcher Prouty stuff, look for his website and CD-ROM.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie is about the relationship between rock journalist and the world of rock and roll.  If you like rock and roll and a coming of age story this one is for you. Almost Famous is a solid movie through and through.  I have had the opportunity to write reviews for rock shows and hang out with &quot;rock stars&quot;.  Cameron Crowe and I are one in the same.  The first time I saw this movie, I had chills for its duration.  If you are infactuated with rock and roll, and want a glimpse of the magical relationship between music and journalism, please buy this movie.  Although I only write for a small town paper, and not Rolling Stone, I completely identify with Crowe, being star struck, not getting interviews, not having things turn out the way they are supposed to.  I owe my life to rock and roll.  Everything I want to aspire to and be is in this movie, everything I want to say to rock and roll as a fan and a journalist is in this movie.  Crowe has said that Almost Famous was his love letter to rock and roll.  Mr. Crowe, thank you for writing it for the both of us.
0312932081|5.0|Ender's Game is my favorite book in the world. It is perfect. I've read it four times. Each time I read it, I was so engrossed that I couldn't put it down! I'm even reading it again right now. The storyline is so well thought out and developed. It's not a surprise that Card has written several more books on the plot. If you enjoyed Space Cadet by Heinlein, then you will love this.
0679745653|4.0|I think everyone will find something in this Capote masterpiece that they can reflect on their own lives. She is a brilliantly described character that you feel like she lives downstairs from you. Everyone that comes in contact with her, indeed falls in love. Capote and Joe Bell are no different. She realizes this but is so hard to get close too. She is like the cat, set out alone in the world. She didn't even want to be personal with the cat by not naming him, no attachments. I think everyone would like to be carefree like Holly but just can't. Capote loved her but just being around her was like oxygen, he didn't want to push the relationship and not have her around. I could go on and on.......must read!
0345347951|2.0|Childhood's End, a science fiction book written by Arthur Clarke, describes his feelings of how the end of Earth will be.  I have never liked science fiction because I believe in the Bible, and most science fiction contradicts what God, the Creator of mankind, has said.  Clarke writes about mankind's last generation.  The book suggests that children will suddenly begin to show signs of being a different species, and soon, mankind will have all evolved into this species.  This is then the end of Earth and life as we know it.  The Supervisor is Karellen, a being from a different planet, who &quot;supervises&quot; man during the ending years of the human race.  However, the Supervisor is not the ruler of all.  He has a superior, the Overmind, from whom he receives instruction.  I believe that God is the highest power there has ever been and there will ever be.  Books such as Childhood's End, that contradict my beliefs, have always seemed silly and unrealistic, because I don't believe in anything that is being proposed.  Some things that were very unrealistic were the aliens in the book.  Also, some of the technology, such as flying cars, seemed too abstract to be believable, even though they may some day come to pass.  Although I disagreed with the overall ideas of the book, it did keep my attention.  This book was not dull and boring, just unbelievable and contradictory to my beliefs.
6300214435|4.0|Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom is not a bad film.  Unforutunatly it lacks the brilliance of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade.<br />The plot is quite interesting at points but is ruined by several corney scenes.  I had not problem with the more extreme violence but parts were people are eating monkey brains and so on are just stupid and make the film seem more tung and cheek. <br />Also the Shorty and Willie are both cliched and boring.  There only purpose is to annoy and really hurt the film in the character department.<br />Still, The Temple of Doom is exciting and well done.  Several scenes(the heart removal for example) are excellent and it's a shame that the films minor flaws drag it down.

080726203X|5.0|Although Ron Rifkin's voice seems monotonal at first, as you listen further, it becomes apparent that the sound fits the text. The society in which the main character, Jonas, resides is also lacking variation. The society in Lois Lowry's, The Giver, is one which frowns upon those things we honor so greatly-- love, compassion, emotional attachment, freedom, creativity,etc. When Jonas turns twelve, he is assigned the task of receiver of memories. Thus begins his transformation and, in the end, Jonas learns too much for his own good. Or maybe not! You have to read it to find out. The writing is superb. I couldn't wait, each day, to listen to this audio book.
6304711875|5.0|This is an amazing horror movie very different from classics like Halloween &amp; Friday the 13th. This modern horror movie still has all the gore but has a fresh cleverness never before used in horror movies. This is the first movie that has really changed the horror genre. <br />Nearly all of the cast is really great. Neve Campbell did an amazing job. You gotta love Gale Weather's style and Deputy Dewey is almost funny! <br />Overall a good movie but the killer/killers aren't much of a surprise.
B00001ODHF|5.0|I myself am a BIG horror movie fan I must have seen hundreds both good and bad,but I must say this would almost definitely put this on nmy top 10 favorite horror movies even though it isn't scary.But sometimes I need a break from the typical horror movie and so when I do need the break this is what I watch.I musdt have seen this movie about 9 times.At first you may not like the plot because it doesn't along with the other two really because it is a change from the past two it has more skelaton type things instead of zombies.But if you liked the past two there is almost a 100% chance you will have no problem getting into this one.But one last warning do not expect to get scared watching this one it is basiclly a dark comedy.
B000002JB3|5.0|&quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; is one of Phil Collins' most overlooked albums. It was released in 1996, during a time when Phil wasn't as popular as he was all throughout the 80's, and still three years off from his comeback with the &quot;Tarzan&quot; movie soundtrack. It's really too bad that not too many people checked out this disc upon it's release, because &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; is one of Phil's best albums, and his finest solo work since 1981's &quot;Face Value.&quot; Highlights include &quot;Lorenzo,&quot; a brilliant tune with lyrics from a poem by Michaela Odone, the young boy who inspired the film &quot;Lorenzo's Oil.&quot; Phil supplies a powerful music bed for this piece, complete with slammin' African drum beats &amp; instrumentation, and heartful vocal delivery. &quot;Just Another Story&quot; is another work of genius, with it's atmospheric, late night stroll-down-the-street vibe, as Phil tells a gripping tale about some people's lives in the big city. It's a very memorable song. &quot;Oughta Know By Now&quot; SHOULD have been this album's secret weapon. With a great guitar hook, tight brass arrangement and powerful drumming and singing from Phil, this song has all the makings of a smash hit, and could've been the song that saved the album from commercial disappointment. And &quot;No Matter Who&quot; is a wonderfully light, breezy number that also could've been a surefire hit.   &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; is a terrific hidden gem from one of the hardest working men in the music biz, Phil Collins. Check it out!
630460291X|2.0|What an unfortunate error on the part of Warner Bros to have put this great movie out in a single-layered format!  They missed EVERY opportunity to make this the incredible movie-experience that it is!  There is no DTS or 5.1 soundtrack, and you have to flip the DVD over at the half-way mark.  <br />If you have read through the other reviews posted here, please ignore the idiotic anti-American sentiments some obviously disturbed individuals put here for you to read - they missed the point of trying of help you decide if you should buy this DVD or not!  My advice - dont.  Not until they fix this particular release.  Get the VHS version and &quot;rough it&quot; until then....END

B000002JSJ|5.0|The lead singer did not know if he would ever walk properly again.  The drummer is heavily addicted to painkillers.  The guitarist has developed a heroin habit.  The band is trying to follow-up their hugely successful (and which made them more famous than they had ever been previously) \\"Physical Graffiti\\".  Plus, the band members have spent most of the past year away from their homes and families due to tax reasons.  <br />It was among this chaos that Led Zeppelin entered a basement studio during the cold Munich winter to record \\"Presence\\";  they only had three weeks to record it to get out in time for the Rolling Stones to record their \\"Black and Blue\\" album (why they put this pressure upon themselves is beyond me--didn't matter anyway ... Page ran out of time and Mick Jagger gave him an additional two days.  Page took one of the days to lay down the guitar overdubs for \\"Achilles Last Stand\\", the next day for all the other songs' solos!<br />\\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is a Zeppelin classic.  The title pokes fun at Plant's leg condition.  The song starts out with a swirling, tightly-strung, echoing guitar as a prelude to the eruption of the band coming in full strength, a chugging, funky bass line from John Paul Jones, great guitar work from Page, and one of Bonham's greatest drumming songs (the others possibly being \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" and \\"In My Time of Dying\\").  <br />\\"For Your Life\\" chronicles drug use amongst the band's acquaintances, be it house guests (one death from overdose at Page's house) or Los Angeles groupies (who, Plant noticed, did not look so well from their cocaine addictions as he'd seen them last, and that they seemed to live their lives just waiting for Zep's return).  Plant snarls.  Bonham tries to put a hole in his bass drum, Jimmy plays some great tremolo work on a Stratocaster which he hardly used in Zep recordings.  One of my favorites on the album.  <br />\\"Royal Orleans\\" is rumored to be about a bed fire in New Orleans Jonesy had after he passed out with a lit joint and upon waking up saw whiskers growing from the \\"woman\\" he thought he was partying with.  Plant jokes that one should not be with a woman that talks like Barry White.  This is break-neck speed-funk which has progressed leaps and bounds from when the band first tried their hand at James Brown funk with \\"The Crunge\\".   Bonzo has a nice little drum thing going on two-thirds through the song.  A fun tune.<br />\\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" highlights some blistering, almost-spastic harmonica work from Plant.  Also some very hard-hitting drumming from John Bonham.  Reminds me a little of \\"Black Dog\\" with the vocalization, but a good tune nonetheless.<br />\\"Candy Store Rock\\" pays homage to the band's love of rockabilly music which they all grew up on.  Plant does his best Elvis impersonation.  I hear the only acoustic guitar on the entire album playing some rhythm here.  A decent song.<br />\\"Hots On For Nowhere\\" is one of the most underrated Zep songs of all-time.  You'll be hearing the \\"la la, la, luh-la, yeah\\" part in your head for days.  My favorite tune on the album.<br />\\"Tea For One\\" starts out with a fast intro, but suddenly halts to one of the most depressed blues you'll ever hear.  A band in pain.  If they had cut maybe four minutes or so out of this one it would have gotten a lot more airplay and more recognition.  Still, when you're in  a dark, dark mood, this one covers you.<br />This album is not easy to digest for the casual Zep listener--it is not the hippy-dippy stuff the band usually put out.  On \\"Presence\\" the band gives no quarter.
B000059T5O|5.0|If you have tried to turn someone on to Tom Waits and they can't get past the vocals(or are too short sighted to)then this is the one.Waits art has always astounded me and John's execution is brilliant. I've waited a long time for this one. John announced at a show last year that this one was coming. I got it on release day. You can tell Waits produced it, however none of the songs sound like the originals and that shows you how varied of artists both of these gentlemen are. This is the best release by far so far this year.( The Catfish 3 CD Charley Patton is next) In other words...GET IT!!!You won't be disappointed.
B000001DQI|1.0|First here is what gives the star to this album (and it is a big star, sorry there aren't more): the epic synthesizer odyessy &quot;Funeral for a Friend.&quot;  I think without this song the time I spent alone in this world would be so much harder than it was.  as it is this song will move you.  I was so touched the first time I heard the full album-length version (they play a short one on the radio--don't listen to it!).  It is a true synthesizer symphony for the 1970's, a heart-wrenching string of emotions and feelings.  This is truly the music of the soul.  Search yours and you will find pain here, but also something uplifting.  Now the problem is the rest of this record: it is too much of a brainless party anthem record.  After such a deep beginning, songs like &quot;Saturday Night Fighting&quot; seem pointless and make me angry.  &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; would be more meaningful if I could understand the lyrics (what does &quot;lend me dairy case&quot; mean?) and if he had made up his mind if the song was about Marilyn Monroe or Princess Diana.  Were they both really like candles in the wind?  Did Princess Di never know who to cling to when the rain came in?  I know he changed the words but it still confuses me.  &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; is a horrible screeching car-wreck that hurts my ears after the sublime beauty of &quot;Funeral for a Friend.&quot;  Several songs are morally distressing to me, as in &quot;Jamaica J-Off&quot; and &quot;All The Girls Love Alice.&quot;  I know that people were different in that decade but in the case of a pop record that is obviously geared toward children I think it is a bad thing.  I guess maybe I'm being harsh but this is how I feel and I wanted to share that with you all.
6304493681|3.0|Ghost in the Shell was good, but weird as well. I had trouble following some parts that weren't explained until well after they had happened. Fortunately, my fiancée had seen Ghost in the Shell before and was able to explain it to me.<br />The animation of Ghost in the Shell is fantastic. In a few places the scenery looks more like it has been filmed rather than drawn, and even the characters have movements that are fluid and graceful, instead of jerky and robotic, like some animated movies can have.<br />The storyline of Ghost in the Shell is pretty straightforward, although the last 15 minutes or so was quite a surprise.  There's a lot of philosophy involved in the movie, mostly about what makes a person truly human, is it the ghost (a soul), or is it the fact we feel human.<br />Ghost in the Shell was well done, and even though I'm not a huge fan of anime I enjoyed it quite a bit.
B000059R8Y|2.0|I hesitate to say anything critical of Eric Clapton, since I am such a tremendous fan and usually *love* everything he does.  Maybe that is why I was so disappointed with this album.  Maybe it is just me, but this album doesn't sound like Eric Clapton at all to me.  The first instrumental reminds me of elevator music, some of the other tracks sound jazzy to me, and a Stevie Wonder song? The rest of the songs have too much piano and not enough guitar playing, which is why I love Eric Clapton so much.  His talent is astounding!  He should show it off! The two redeeming songs on this album are Superman Inside, which almost sounds like the E.C. I know and love, and Come Back Baby.  On Come Back Baby, Eric puts his whole heart and soul into the singing and as a result, it is AWESOME!  This is what E.C. does best: sing the blues! I just wish I loved the rest of the album as much.
0486650677|5.0|Lanzcos has his name attached to many area of mathematical physics. Besides that, he is an excellent writer. This book on  variationnal principle of mechanics is the most beautifull and profound one I've read on the subject. This book is well suited for undergrad or grad students, but even for reasearcher who uses the tools of analytical mechanics, it's worth reading it.
B00000255F|5.0|Back in 1975 I had never heard of Bruce Springsteen. But my brother had, and one day he asked me to tape a concert off the radio of Bruce playing at the Roxy. That concert started out with &quot;Thunder Road&quot; (The actual cut released on his live box set) and I was hooked. I went out the next day and bought Born to Run, and have listen to the record (and later purchased CD) consistantly for the past 21 years.<br />Quite simply, there is not a bad cut on this CD. Each and every song tells a humanistic story that anyone could relate to. My favorites here are the aformentioned &quot;Thunder Road&quot; and the epic &quot;Jungleland&quot; (also played that night at the roxy but not included in the box set).<br />I would strongly recommend this to ANY rock &amp; roll fan. This rates as one of the all-time best albums.
B00004RF98|5.0|Take one of the greatest songs ever, a host of other superb songs, one of the two most charasmatic singer-actor-dancers ever (Gene Kelly), a gorgeous and superbly talented singer-actress (Debbie Reynolds), one of the great supporting actors and most athletic dancers ever to light up the silver screen (Donald O'Connor), and a humorous and uplifting love story with a hysterical subplot, and what have you got?  You guessed it, Singin in the Rain.  Yes, the Broadway Melody sequence may drag on just a little too long, but everything else here is sheer perfection, a masterpiece for the ages that will never be dated.  Along with Easter Parade, this one gets my vote for the Great American Musical.
0451191153|5.0|I read this book in art school and loved it.  15 years later, I am still very much indebted to this book for changing the way I look at things.  I understand that because Alan Greenspan recently mentioned Ayn Rand, everyone is going out to purchase this book.  All I can say is, this book is not for everyone.  If you are going to take the characters in the book at face value, you will hate this book.  If you are a working architect, you might laugh at this book.  If you are a &quot;team-player&quot; you will not want to pick up this book.<br />Lighten up people!  Howard Roark is an idea, not a person.  He is an idea that lives in all of us.  A desire to be individuals in whatever we do.  I may not agree with Objectivism all the way through, but this book definitely made me look at what makes up an individual.  Then and now, I respect and admire Ayn Rand for writing it.
6304078145|5.0|I like many kinds of movies, also silly comedies like `Dumb &amp; Dumber'. `Four Rooms' is about as serious and about as funny as that one (except that it has less dirty jokes). It is very fun, I think. Obviously, some people don't like it, but if you don't mind silly comedies that are made only to be fun, with no deeper meaning, I think you will laugh a lot while you watch this movie. I laughed almost every minute. Tim Roth is overacting in a funny way and makes it without getting too annoying. The cast is impressing, but don't expect to see very much of the stars. Most of them have very small parts and quite few lines. <br />If you don't expect this movie to be serious at all, I think you will be very entertained. But if you know you don't like that kind of movies, I guess you should avoid it. But if you don't mind watching a silly movie now and then, give it a try!
0394800389|5.0|Dr. Seuss has created another entertaining children's classic with &quot;Fox in Socks.&quot; The plot is simple: the clever title character dazzles his friend Knox with a series of increasingly complex tongue twisters. Along the way, Seuss reveals a number of fantastic images: a marching band in which all the musicians are pigs, a crow in a top hat, and more.<br />The book even has a touch of science fiction when the Fox introduces Knox to a weird lake of chewing gum-like blue goo. But it's the tongue twisting rhymes that are the central attraction of this book. By the time you get to the &quot;muddle puddle tweetle poodle beetle noodle bottle paddle battle,&quot; you will certainly appreciate Seuss's writerly virtuosity. This is a fun book, and the Fox earns his place alongside Seuss's most memorable characters.
B000004CYT|4.0|I still remember the first time I heard the Symphonies 1&2 from this set. At the time I was used to the Bohm, VPO set on DGG, A friend gave me a copy of the album that featured Christopher Hogwood and the AAM on the L'Oiuseau-Lyre label and said that I must listen to this recording. What a revelation Maestro Hogwood and the AAM had managed to make Beethoven sound \\"new\\" again. I used to own the first four symphonies with Hogwood and the AAM on L.P's and had the rest of the symphonies with the Hanover Band on Nimbus. Both groups were in competition to get their sets out, as I recall I ended up with the Hanover Band recordings, but will get the Hogwood set. It will be interesting to compare it to the Gardiner, ORR set on Archiv, to see which performances sound better. It might also be interesting to compare it to the Zinman set on Arte Nova, or the Abbado, BPO set on DG. I suspect that the Hogwood set can hold its own against them all, and at a very good price to boot.
B000059R8Y|4.0|One of the first things I check when artists like Eric Clapton or BB King release a new album is whether it contains NEW material or if its mostly recycled old tunes.<br />This album has NEW stuff! They're not all EC songs, but many are.  This album may not CHANGE THE WORLD or cause TEARS IN HEAVEN, but if you're a fan, you won't be disappointed.<br />There's a little bit from all of the different Clapton styles over the years.
B000056MOD|1.0|Please, for everything that is right and good in this world, do not see this movie. EVER. It promises to be detrimental to your psyche.<br />I had every intention of liking this movie. I swear! I enjoy the Highlander series (save for #2, naturally, I am not a complete idiot :), and Christopher Lambert is among my favorite screen presences.<br />HOWEVER (sorry for the spoiler, but this needs to be said)Connor McLeod gets killed in this movie. By none other than Duncan McLeod (think Highlander the series). And if THAT is not assenine enough for you, the plot is twisty like a bad pretzel, and not in the usual interesting way. This is simply thrown together, and seems to be directed by the folks that put together the TV show. Adrian Paul is mostly pretty to look at, but he really comes off as a big ol' weenie - yes, that is a technical term - in this one. Whining his way through this film is definitely NOT becoming of him. The scripting is bad, the acting by most of the supporting cast is not much better, and the musical score....well, I won't go there.<br />Please trust me in that this is a horrible horrible piece of tripe.  You would be better off with 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'. Then again, wouldn't we all?

This is what a &quot;deluxe edition&quot; should be.<br />I am amazed at what can be done today with such old, analog source material.  I only wish digital had been around to capture some of the best music in history.<br />My first exposure to Blind Faith came on EC's Crossroads 1.  I am glad to finally have the definitive version from which that material came.<br />If you like the D&amp;D Layla boxed set, then this edition will be to your liking.
B000056K04|4.0|Like most everybody else, I have been eagerly awaiting the new Dave Matthews Band's album ever since it was first announced way back when, claiming it would be released in November of 2000.  It was delayed, supposedly until January of the new year.  February rolls around, and finally, after going to a special party at a local music store (they were releasing the CD at midnight of the 26th, the album would be released to the public the next day), I finally had my little piece of heaven.<br />Or so I thought.  Before the release of the EVERYDAY, I purchased the issue of Rolling Stone with the DMB on the cover, no doubt also purchased by some of you.  In the article, it said that Dave was trying to work on a new album during the middle of last year, only to sink into depression and a touch of alcoholism.  He eventually meet with producer Glenn Ballard, and a new CD spawned from a newly enlightened Dave Matthews.  However, the album no doubt has Glenn Ballard written all over it.  He wanted to take DMB in a new direction, saying, for instance, that a normal DMB song is six minutes, so let's try and put that same amount of music in half that time.  <br />They succeeded and failed at the same time.  Like a previous reviewer said, all the Tinsley and Beauford solos are gone, and those are one of the main reasons why many of us loved DMB songs. This is one of my main complaints about the album.  It also sounds more commercialized, something I can't stand in music.  <br />But I also understand what Dave was going through.  If this album drove away some demons inside him, I will gladly accept any music he cares to produce.  Perhaps he'll return to his roots come the next LP.  <br />But all in all, the CD isn't that bad.  Yes, they are short, rarely going over four minutes, but now Dave's voice and lyrics drive the music, and that's not a bad thing.  &quot;I Did It&quot; is catchy, and despite what others say, is a fairly decent song.  Other favorites of mine are &quot;When the World Ends&quot; (supposedly Dave's favorite lyrics wise), &quot;Dreams of Our Fathers&quot;, &quot;What You Are&quot;, and &quot;Mother Father&quot;.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is a perfect example of how to end an album.  <br />All and all, it's a decent piece of musical composition.  I do have issues with it, geared more towards Ballard's concept, but I'm a large enough Dave fan not to care.  I'm just glad it's Dave, and a happy Dave.
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay are huge in England and look to be cracking the American market now. Their gentle swooping guitars, infectious basslines and lightly resounding drums come together to create a sound experience quite like no other.<br />Other bands in England of their genre, Brit-Indie, include Radiohead (exclduing thier most recent album), Doves etc, but Coldplay have become current favorites in the UK.<br />Although the albums is not too varied, there are many wonderful songs, perfectly complemented by the voice of Chris Martin. Yellow is a complete classic with a beautiful melody; Shiver is more of a rocker but still has the same touchingly precarious sound. Coldplay do use some heavier guitars in their songs: the opening riffs in both Yellow and Shiver are pleasingly low-fi.<br />Other songs are great driving music (Sparks) Soaring beauty (Don't Panic) Painstaking Melodies (Trouble), Excellent falsetto (Spies) and acoustic gems (We Never Change).<br />Definately worth buying.
039472903X|5.0|I've owned the same doggeared, underlined, highlighted and notated copy of Ogilvy on Advertising for 15 years and it never ceases to amaze me that while I continue to buy and read advertising and marketing books at a steady clip I keep coming back to the most pleasurable and sensible book on the subject I've ever read.<br />I could break the book down and give my opinion on this or that but the book is such a delightful read you should just dive in.<br />Granted, some may say that the book is out of date but I counter that (oops, with my opinion) Ogilvy understood people and tapped into the fact that regardless of the passage of time and all of our new mellinnium brilliance, we're all basically the same under the surface and basically the same as people 100 years ago.<br />Enjoy it.
0425152251|4.0|Being a college freshman, and not yet enrolled in a introductory philosophy class, I find Sophie's World to be a nice overview of the main points of major philosophers in history.  I was disappointed that none of the American or Eastern philosophers were included in the novel.  The story was interesting enough to help me to continue reading when some of the theories got difficult to understand.  I do not think that the majority of American 15 year olds will be able to comprehend all of the theories (there were students in my class aged 18-22 who did not fully understand all aspects of the novel), but they will obviously be able to understand the story line. I enjoyed reading it, even though it was for a class, and recommend it to others at least 17 years old.

B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I may not be a movie guru, but I know this movie is the funniest parody I've seen in a while.  You do have to watch some movies to get most the jokes (Matrix, 6th sense, Scream, etc) but all in all it's a good show.  There's quite a bit of sexual content, but if you're comfortable with yourself- all the more laughs for you!   I definitely recommend this movie for a rainy day or a night with mature friends.

It takes a while to get into it, but once you have all the characters straight, it's hilarious. I found myself picturing my own coworkers in each of the characters' roles.  We all know people like this - the humor that comes with recognition is the greatest humor of all.  Hope to see a sequel!

However, if you want to learn and understand Price Theory, this book will probably just frustrate you. All the math and models are there, but none of the verbal discussion one needs to really learn a subject. In my admittidely small sample, professors like the book because it's mathematically rigorous and complete, but students hate it because they really want to learn, and this book doesn't help.
B000056VIY|4.0|What a difference a day, I mean year, makes.  After a hit debut album containing a couple of good songs and marred by hollow and soulless vocal work, Jennifer Lopez shows marked improvement on her sophomore disc.  For one, the overall song quality is far more consistent, and the variety of the songs manages to flow more seamlessly than the first album, which came off as a patchwork of bad songs culled from varying genres.  Among the standouts are the funky 'Play', the quasi-techno 'Walking on Sunshine', and first track 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'.  On the down side, 'I'm Real' sounds like a Janet Jackson cast-off waaaay back from her CONTROL days, and 'Ain't It Funny', though appealing sounds like Madonna's &quot;La Isla Bonita' without any vocal personality.  Which brings us to Lopez's voice, a truly weak instrument that doesn't have alot of character and lucky for her seems to be technically enhanced throughout most of the disc.  With that said, she wisely, for the most part, avoids ballads in favor of uptempo numbers in which her voiced can be further enhanced.  Overall, the songs manage to compensate for whatever vocal skill Lopez lacks.
B000059MEK|5.0|Everybody else here has written up a little blurb on all the tracks on the CD.  I don't own the CD.  I don't even own the single.  I've only heard one song on the album.  But I bought a nintendo 64 for Goldeneye: 007.  I bought the Eagles - Hell Freezes Over for Desperado(and hotel california).  I bought the Wild Things DVD for the sex scene.  I bought a PS2 for tekken tag tournament.  My friend sent me track 4 off of Daft Punk's new CD: Harder Better Faster Stronger.  I listened to it, I listened to it again, listened to it for a third time to make sure it was as good as I thought it was, then ordered the CD.  He says that all the songs are good, and I hope they are, but if they aren't, that's okay.  That song blew me away.  You know where you hear a song and you say to yourself, &quot;This is a hit&quot;.  It's one thing when you hear it on MTV, but it's another thing when you find it the day the CD is released.  I knew I liked Daft Punk, I played Homework 'till the CD player scratched the table of contents on the CD (I swear, it was the CD player!), but I didn't know HOW MUCH I liked these guys until I heard this song.  The &quot;vocorder&quot; they use in &quot;Harder Better Faster Stronger&quot; was always a favorite of mine (started when I heard &quot;do you feel like we do&quot; on an oldies radio station, wavered a little with &quot;believe&quot;, and is now back in full force), and these guys blow me away with what they did.  Listen to the song, understand what I mean.  It is art.
0451160916|5.0|The Shining definitely is one of the most bone-chilling books you will ever read.  It is about a family that decides to take care of The Overlook Hotel during the winter.  Hoping to solve their family problems, they set aside their lives and abandon themselves into the hotel.  Despite the fact of the brutal murders that took place just the previous winter.  As time goes on, they soon realize their dreams of some nice family time is out of the picture.  Strange things begin happening and Jack, the father, begins to go insane and Danny, the son, begins to see the hotels gruesome history through his mind.  This book was very well written and extremely bizzare.  If you like strange and weird stories, you are guaranteed to like this.
6305470464|5.0|If you love movies with witty and stellar dialogue this is for you! I have always loved Ryan Phillipe for his looks, but in this he actually shows true talent! And Angelina Jolie........well nothing less than fabulous can ever be said about her! She is hilarious and terrific as Joan and completely perfect for the role. Her talent and flair radiate off the screen like you would not believe!Equally awe-inspiring is Gillian Anderson and John Stewart. What a better way to meet a guy than having his bookself fall on you!The only part I was not satisfied with was between the minister and gracie. I was not thrilled, although Hugh(Dennis Quaid) was pretty good. I found the storyline of a woman cheating on her husband with a minister a little too creapy. The title should have been dancing about architecture! Oh and by the way........The soundtrack is pretty cool too.
0425170349|5.0|I could not put this book down. Rainbow Six had everything that I could wish for; action, suspence, gory details, terrorism, counter terrorism, EVERYTHING.
B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty was a very clever motion picture, but there were a few parts of the movie that lagged a little bit.  Namely, the parts where Kevin Spacey and Mena Suvari were absent.  I think too much of the middle of the movie focused heavily on the two teenage kids, and those parts were kind of slow.  I really wished that the movie had a bit more of the entertaining Kevin Spacey, and the drop-dead gorgeous Mena Suvari.  (The scene between Spacey and Suvari toward the end was awesome!)  Overall, the movie was entertaining, and I would beable to see it again, mainly because of Mena Suvari.  She's a babe!  I highly recomend this movie for a quiet night at home!
B000007T1M|4.0|SOAD is a very solid band. Most of their songs are good, if not great, and they have a creative vocalist. In other words, they differ from the other so called &quot;new metal&quot; bands today. Their music is hard, but only relative to most other of the bands. They have a political purpose to their music, but unlike Rage they have yet to go completely mainstream. Anything you hear on the radio is mainstream, but there are different levels. System Of A Down certainly is not the most extreme mainstream band, but they most certainly are not underground. SOAD put on a great show when I saw them last summer on the &quot;Sanitarium&quot; tour. I would categorize them as thrashy new metal. Really there only a few other bands that show as much intellect as SOAD, in new metal atleast. I would like to believe that System will not end up like Rage, Korn, etc, but selling out seems to be the trend for new metal bands. Some other good new metal bands are Chevelle, Deftones, Sevendust, Soulfly, and Fear Factory. The best tracks on the album are &quot;Suite Pee&quot;, &quot;Cubert&quot; and &quot;Know&quot;.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I watched this movie not knowing what to expect, although since i had seen Pi before, i was expecting something heavy. <br />Something about it made me feel emotions, but I didn't cry because something about it didn't seem right. It's more like something where I just have to sit and think for a while, but even that may not help. <br />The idea of following a druggie with their addiction may be old, but the way it is done is wonderful. The intertwining of the stories only adds to the experience. Also it follows not only those who brought the addiction upon themselves, but it also incorporates those who became addicted innocently.<br />This is definatly a movie you can't watch when down because you can't just walk away without being affected, but i suppose that is a sign of a good movie, isn't it?
6305073341|4.0|Saw it in theatre twice. Watch in on LD countless times and now watching the DVD. The standard issue DVD is OK but the sound can't even match the old Image Entertainment LD. What a shame. If you can, get the Critterion collection DVD instead with lots of extras. This standard DVD is currently out of print and since most Orion titles have been reissued by MGM, I bet this one and its 2 sequels will appear soon on DVD. But judging from the recent DVD releases from MGM of older titles (Escape from NY, Platoon), I really doubt anything special will accompany the releases. But anyway this is such a great movie, any DVD format you can get, get it now. Well worth it, you can watch it over and over again.
0553278223|5.0|This boook is amazing. It is completely packed full of insights into the darkness of the human nature. Different stories tell of different expeditions sent to mars, on which beautiful ancient civilizations of martians live. Unfortunatly, when the humans reach mars, the perfect images of a green, earthlike mars are shattered. <br />Ray Bradbury effectivly expresses under a series of stories the grim reality of the human race. A reality that has been supressed, yet always reappears periodically.<br />If you enjoy reading about science fiction, and about the greediness and evilness of the human race, this book will be your best treat! Just remember. Don't read this late at night, or your head will be bursting with so many thoughts that you won't be able to go to sleep.
B0000508U6|5.0|When I was in London Coldplay was #1 on the charts and I made the mistake of only buying the trouble single while there.  When I returned home I realized I had to have Parachutes but to my surprise it was nowhere.  Finally the band seems to have made a name for itself over here and this is truly on of the most promising bands I have ever heard of.  It's not only for people who love Radiohead or Travis...but for fans of music in general.  The best track on the cd is &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot;.  &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Spies&quot; are also incredible songs.  Not only does Coldplay's debut cd move anyone who gives it a chance, it also provides hope that people with real musical ability will end in up in the spotlight instead of these tired boy bands and teen idols.
0385486804|1.0|When I was asked to read Into the Wild for a class, I tried to approach it with an even perspective.  Though I have never been a fan of biographies, this one blew me away.  No, not because it was good, because it belonged in the fantasy section.  John Krakauer has held up a half-witted coward as a symbol of Alaska, and frankly, Alaska is dissapointed.  Krakauer claims he is the ideal adventurer, then let me ask, why did he DIE!?  Right from the beginning, I could find mistake that McCandless made, big ones!  I have never been out in the wilderness of Alaksa by myself, but the knowledge I have from spending my life in Alaska gives me more smarts than that junkie.  Another thing that irked me was the way McCandless was held up as so smart.  Those of you in the other 49 states have absolutely no idea how many crazy mountain men or avante garde californians come up here and try to live of the wild.  It's disgraceful to us.  Just a few years ago, a man like McCandless decided to live on the hill that I live on.  Now mind you, this is a nice neighborhood outside of town, not a bunch of cabins.  This man proceeded to set up a tent on the edge of our neighbor's back lawn.  He didn't think that someone might own the land that he was on, and that just because this Alaska, it doesn't been you can just go wherever you want!  Many people have come up and asked the government to give them large land grants on prime property for free.  Some don't even ask the government, they just move in.  Nowhere else in America is this tolerated, so why should you think it doesn't apply up here?!  McCandless was a fool, and a fool does not deserve to be glorified.
0345440757|5.0|I have to tell you how much I learned from this book and thank Tracy  for writing it. We have a wonderful 4 year old who didn't sleep through the night until he was 18 months. Now, we have a beautiful, easy (textbook-Tracy's term!), 6 month old  named Carl and I thankfully heard about your book before I totally ruined his sleep habits too. <br />gratefully,  Ruth
B00004T37H|5.0|WOW! This movie left me speachless when I saw it. I never knew a cartoon could have so much depth and feeling. Set in Midevil Japan, A boy named Ashitaka is the last prince of an almost completeley wiped out tribe. When killing a demon god from harming his vilage, he is cursed. He himself will turn into a demon. So he is forced to leave his village and seek out the spirit of the forest. One thing you should know is that all the animals have the power to talk. But if the spirit of the forest is killed, the animals become stupid, as they are today. Ashitaka journeys through a forest and finds two wounded men. He safely transports them to their village of iron town, where he finds the leader to be a woman. Lady Iboshi. The town is always at war with the animals because there is iron in the forest and they are after it. The only way to get it is to cut down the forest and this makes the animals mad. On top of this, the wolves have a human daughter. Princess of the wolves. She enters the village to attack Lady Iboshi, but Ashitaka stops her. He flees with the Princess, but he was shot. Realizing that he is on her side, she takes him to the enchanted part of the forest where the spirit lives. The spirit heals his flesh wound, but does not lift the curse. When the big battle happens against the boars and the humans, the boars loose. One of the boar gods begins to turn into a demon. Princess Mononoke tries to stop it and it begins to change her too. Whats worse is that Lady Iboshi is on her way to kill the spirit of the forest. Ashitaka has to stop it in time and save himself and Mononoke from the curse. The soundtrack is also great. I recomend both. Buy them today.
0790729989|4.0|Awesome movie, but do not buy this version.  I bought this edition and regret it because 3 months later they released the New Line Platinum Series.  It has many more special features for about the same price.
B000002GVO|5.0|While many so-called critics slammed The Eagles for producing great songs but overall so-so albums, I personally feel that most of those critics can no more identify with what it takes to produce an album than I can with performing brain sugery.  Simply put The Eagles are one of the greatest bands of the past 30 YEARS, and 'Hotel California' ranks as one of the best albums produced by ANYONE within that time.  I could go into the depth of the lyrics versus the musical harmonies but honestly, what is the point?  You either like the music or you don't.  Simple.  I LIKE the music, VERY MUCH.  Face it, could ANYONE making music in the 70's compete with the songs The Eagles produced when they were on a roll?  No WAY!<br />If the public is any measuring stick, The Eagles are one of the most popular bands in HISTORY.  I've been in radio for the better part of my adult life and in all that time the popularity of The Eagles has NEVER ceased.  Another wonder that they have been able to pull off is crossing the generation gap by being loved by people of all ages and backgrounds (similar to Pink Floyd). I don't pretend to understand it at all, but I have to admit, it IS interesting to hear a teenager request 'Hotel California' and no they are NOT a casual Eagles fan.  This album is one to savor over and over and one of the truly rare examples of classic rock music that actually IMPROVES over time rather than become stale like so much that was recorded in the 70's and viewed as 'timeless' music.  Not just good, but GREAT music from a band that proved with the release of 'Get Over It' on their fantastic 'Hell Freezes Over' CD that they can still produce seriously fantastic stuff.  Buy this CD.  Open up.  Listen.  Repeat.  Extremely Recommended.
B000000H6D|5.0|My first exposure to TON was October Rust. I absolutely loved that CD and I knew I had to get the entire TON catalog. I had heard that TON had generated a lot of controversy from their previous albums. But nothing would prepare me for what I was going to hear for the first minute of this album. The sounds of a ... Wow now that is a beginning. Bloody Kisses has got all the elements that make it a Goth classic. Slow long songs, distorted guitars, ethereal keyboards and vocals deeper than a grave. Although the music is dark and moody the lyrics are amusing in most cases. This album also contains two of the greatest Goth songs Christian Woman and Black No 1. These two songs are alone worth the price of the disc. But there are other gems too. The title song, an 11 minute dirge could only be attempted by a band like TON. Other songs worth mentioning are Summer Breeze that make a happy carefree song sound like a graveyard dirge. Too Late: Frozen and Blood and Fire are good standard Goth rock songs. The fillers are entertaining without getting too irritating. We hate everyone and Kill All the White People are reminiscent of their early work. Cant Lose You is another good song but suffers due to its length as it becomes too repetitious.  My final verdict buy this disc blindly. If you are a fan of TON you must get this or die! If you are new to them or Goth rock/metal in general I would suggest you first try out October Rust and then their other work.<br />This album is a masterpiece. Finis.
B000000Y59|5.0|If you are having any doubts about buying this cd, put your mind to rest and just buy it.  It is the best trio cd in the world.  Incredibly swinging, lyrical, innovative, and adventurous.  There is no way you will regret buying this cd.  It is definetly on my desert island list. Just buy it. Go ahead, your life will be better as a result.
B000059MEK|1.0|I'm sorry, but after reading the posted reviews claiming that anyone who liked &quot;Homework&quot; will like this one I felt obligated to state my opinion: This album is awful. I am a house DJ who absolutly LOVED Daft Punk's &quot;Homework&quot;. I believe it to be some of the best house music ever writen, with phat beats, awesome basslines, and very original composition. All that is gone in &quot;Discovery&quot;. Instead, it's plagued with whimpy beats, cheesy synths, and lyrics so trite they literally make me cringe. I can barely believe this album came from the same two guys that hooked it up so well in 1997. If you loved &quot;Homework&quot; for any of the reasons I mentioned above, be warned: this is not even close to the same.
0679746048|4.0|Susanna Kaysen at age 18 was sent to a mental hospital to 'rest' and stayed there for almost 2 years.  In short chapters she describes other patients, doctors and strange oddities of living in a mental institution (Like ice cream trips).  One of the more interesting facts of this particular institution are the famous patients who stayed there before her. This is a very quick read.. couple of hours is all you need.  The movie is also very good and very much like the book.

B00000GAIW|5.0|This album is completely perfect.  To me, it ranks up there with Pink Floyd's DSOTM and The Wall.  Tull sure did know a lot about music.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's voice has a relaxing yet strong quality that lets the songs come out unstrained and easy to listen to.<br />I have been listening to this disc for a few weeks and still enjoy the songs just as much as the first time, even after listening to the whole disk multiple times in succession.<br />This is a def must buy.
B000056K04|4.0|This is an awesome CD.  It includes the smash hit, &quot;I Did It&quot;, which, alone, would make the CD well worth buying.

B000058T5E|5.0|You Had It Coming is one of Jeff's best, and as I stated above certainly lives up to BBB and Wired. YHIC is packed with the most excellent melodies and funky, dance-able beats. I was glad to see Jeff co-wrote some of the tunes on YHIC, and he writes and plays in fine fashion. He is the best damn guitarist on the planet. <br />Earthquake certainly sounds like its title, and it's obvious that this is a Jennifer Batten composition. Roy's Toy, a tribute to Roy Brizio, a guy who builds cars for Jeff, is a great, great tune. Dirty Mind is great rock, and Rollin and Tumblin is some excellent blues. Nadia is the standout tune of the ablum, it is truly great, and it is just as good as 'Cause We've Ended as Lovers and Where Were You. Rosebud is great funk. Clapton and Page, eat your heart out.
B00004WG4G|5.0|Unlike some other films of the recent past.  And to me it was a miracle that a film such as this could garner enough appeal both with the academy and the public alike.  Because much of what the film portrays is not necessarily so flattering about the society in which we live.  <br />This film touched on many taboo subjects which I don't want to get into so as not to ruin the film for first time viewers.  And most importantly it attacks those subject areas head on with a take no prisoners attitude.<br />In my mind the real question is just what is true American Beauty.  Well the one thing that I came away with is that real beauty is not what the majority of our society thinks it is.  Meaning that outward beauty and strength are not necessarily synonomous with inner (true) beauty.  And as George Costanza found out that sometimes the opposite of what you think... is often true.<br />What is ultimately expressed by the film is the notion that appearances, respect, and adulation from friends, spouses, relatives or society at large is meaningless without self respect and self direction.  A radical concept for our predominately superficial mindset.<br />Kevin Spacey is phenomenal.<br />An absolute Classic!
B000058T5E|5.0|And don't take my word for it, just listen to his new album, You Had It Coming. Words cannot explain this masterpiece.
0767830555|4.0|Taxi Driver dramatizes the all too human condition of loneliness, a human being who moves through maddening crowd, jostled, brushed, ignored, abused, hassle, provoked but who is somehow utterly untouched by any of it because of his secret world of fantasy and his inability to communicate with his fellow humans. In short a lonely man, aching to be noticed, recognized and loved, but unable to attain it.
B00000I924|4.0|Who Else is great, however not Jeff's best. <br />Ten years of waiting for this...and it was worth the wait. Brush With the Blues is worth the four stars alone, Jeff makes his guitar scream and howl. What Mamma Said is great rock, and Psycho Sam will appeal to any young person. Declan proves Jeff's tone is still awesome, and Even Odds is great (especially because it's a Jan Hammer tune.)<br />While I enjoy this CD a lot, there were some flaws. Steve Alexander's drumming is a bit choppy and clumpy, thank goodness for some of the digital drums. Space for the Papa, while is has a good solo, gets a little boring after a while. Overall the songs lack a bit.<br />While Who Else is great, this is not Jeff's best. I would recommend &quot;You Had It Coming&quot; or &quot;Wired&quot; instead of this. Don't get me wrong, this is still a great buy.
B00004YKSD|5.0|About two years ago I wrote a review of this movie (VHS) so I won't go into that here (you can find it in the list of reviews). This time I'm focusing on the DVD-specific features which make this release a must-have. Oliver Stone's running commentary (which does not mute the movie audio but plays over it) is fascinating and provides real insights into his creative processes. A cool feature: in addition to the scene index you can also jump directly to a particular Doors song in the film. Disc Two holds the real gems. Included here are 43 minutes of deleted scenes, some of which deserved deletion, others which could have been interesting in the final film. Either way a lot of the odd cuts and edits in the final product now make a lot more sense. The &quot;Road of Excess&quot; documentary features interviews with some of the cast but of particular interest here are the comments from Patricia Keneally and her take on Stone's &quot;vision&quot; and portrayal/malignment of Morrison. A definate recommendation for any Doors fan.
B000059MEK|5.0|This music is addictive.  If you 'get' it, you'll be trapped by its spell--unable to remove the CD from your player, looping it endlessly.<br />Just listen.<br />Some highlights:<br />One More Time -- ubercatchy and fun.  Just a plain feel good track.<br />Harder, Faster, Better Stronger -- crazy use of the vocoder on this one; take that Cher!<br />Superheroes -- Tweak a Barry Manilow sample to ultimate effect.  Great closer for a long night of dancing.<br />High Life -- Disco.  Period.<br />Veritas Quo -- Addictive in its simplicity, with a sad tinge.<br />Too Long -- A grower.  Seems to simple, but after a few listens, you're hooked to the vibe and want to play this track again and again.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay is an outstanding group!  <br />I was initially attracted to this CD because of the song, &quot;Yellow&quot; but have since discovered that I like many of Coldplay's other songs and their overall style.  <br />Yellow is one of the few songs out there that I could never get tired of, regardless of my mood the song has something in it for me.  <br />When I realized this album actually came out in November of 2000 I couldn't believe I had been missing it all this time.  Even now the local radio stations don't play songs like &quot;Yellow&quot; often enough.  <br />This group and CD is highly reccommended!
B00003CXA2|5.0|I have to laugh at the self-important, self-appointed, hyper-critical critics who not only lambast this movie, but also those who dare enjoy it. Such cynicism comes from a heart hardened by this often hostile world.  I have a great deal of pity for those who would call Forrest Gump a &quot;vile pile&quot;.  Oh, if only the masses could call upon the infinite wisdom of such people.  I'm sure that we, too, could learn the deepest depths of cynicism and disdain for beauty and goodness.<br />Gump is a triumph.  Deal with it.
B000056K04|2.0|DMB is back.  First they sold out, I don't care what Dave Matthews says, he sold out.<br />The video is very hi-tech to grab anyone with ADD, attention deficit disorder, the album cover....what can I say it is the most polished album cover yet, for DMB, they hired the best graphic design artist.<br />But inside its just another bore.  Dave Matthews peaked with &quot;Crash&quot;, and has fallen ever since.<br />This CD just shows that this is just the same ole DMB, but not as good.  The songs sound rushed, the album over produced, Matthews vocals hidden in the production.<br />DMB has reached where every other band like REM, Aerosmith, and  Spandau Ballet....commercial land, where their egos got bigger and their albums got smaller.<br />It shows with the first single  &quot;I Did It&quot; already faltering on the Billboard singles chart not even reaching the Top 50 of the Top 100, and 2nd week sales drop a whopping 62% from 732,000 units the week before still holding its No.1 position for the week of March 24, 2001, but it just shows, everybody jumps and gets on the bandwagon buys the album sight and sound unheard, but in 2 weeks the word is getting out.  B- O - M - B.<br />DMB is on the way of Hootie and the Blowfish, Alanis Morrisette, The Spin Doctors, etc....to where are they now?<br />This album confirms that DMB is on the way out.<br />Dave Matthews I don't care if you said you didn't sold out, you DID.

B000059R8Y|5.0|Eric Clapton a singer with class.<br />The vocals, the production, the songwriting on this album are absolutely first rate.<br />I bet this will be up for album of the year at the Grammies in 2002.<br />All the songs are first rate, my faves are &quot;Modern Girl&quot;, &quot;Son &amp; Sylvia&quot; and &quot;Reptile&quot;, but they are all great.<br />Clapton always delivers to his fans and to the American public and with &quot;Reptile&quot; he has one more classic to add to his collection.<br />A defitinite add for your CD library.
B00003CXE7|3.0|Gladiator is a good movie.  Got that?  A good movie, not a great movie.  Not even an excellent movie.  Just a good movie.  I saw it in the theatre and was disappointed because I was hoping for greatness and something special.  Instead, I got an opening battle that was shot so murkily it was hard to follow the action (it IS much better &amp; clearer on the DVD), and then a story that was by turns interesting (Crowe's journey) and boring (Phoenix's machinations and lust for his sister etc.).  It shifted from good action sequences (although they were over edited to almost incomprehensibility on the big screen....again better on the DVD) to lifeless passages outside the arena.   Russel Crowe, as usual, was very good.  Joaquin Phoenix was a joke (and I don't give a damn if he was nominated for an Oscar).  The story became more ridiculous as it went along...that an emperor of Rome would allow a man sworn to kill him to live for 10 minutes past discovering his identity was laughable.  And wound up with this Hollywood clap-trap ending where all the Romans are going to join hands and march into the sunset and restore &quot;The Republic&quot;.  This is junk writing and popular hooey. So, I give it the good rating for action &amp; production values and a good cast giving okay performances.  But if this lightweight piece of nonsense wins a bunch of Academy Awards it will only be further proof that that august body of voters wouldn't know a real film with depth and integrity from a hole in the wall.
0451169514|5.0|One of the best king novels he's written in my opinion
6305546789|5.0|This movie has all the best elements of a good scare . A simple but unforgetable soundtrack that grab the veiwer's attention and won't let go . A memorable villian in Micheal Myers whose faceless mask is scrarier than an elaborate one , it gives a feeling of blank mindless horror . A heroine that may not get the upper hand over Micheal . And then there is the voice of doom and gloom , Dr. Loomis . Ultimately Laurie's saviour but is he ? That's for the sequels to answer .<br />The DVD itself is top notch . Anchor Bay is fast becoming my DVD company of choice . From the vast array of extras to the execellent cover work this is one that is worth owning .I look forward to more from Anchor Bay .

B000002UJQ|5.0|This is quite possibly the greatest album from the last 10 years!!!!Kid A is probably like one of the worst cd's ever tho, likethere are only 2 decent songs in it, idioteque, and optimistic. But ok computer is excellent!tracks such as carma police and paranoid android tells u why this album rocks! BUY IT NOW!!!!
B000056K04|5.0|New Fan of DMB.  Heard &quot;Everyday&quot; CD while in a music store.  &quot;Who is that voice?...and who is that great band?&quot; I thought!  Have heard the name DMB...but guess didn't know his &quot;sound&quot;.  I became an instant Fan.  I LOVE EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM AND WAKE UP EVERY MORNING TO IT!  Read a review by someone who said this CD was for 40-year olds still trying to act like they know good music.  I'm a 40 year old and a late-comer to DMB, too bad I wasn't introduced earlier by a 20-year old.  I surely, would have listened...
0380729407|2.0|Two boys, a small town and an evil carnival.  Sounds campy, but it's actually a good story, problem is, this is not a good book.  Bradbury can invoke your childhood wonder of life and the brashness of youth and in that way it's a very good book.  You can feel the fear of the boys of Mr. Dark, but you also feel thier wonder of him and his show, makes you really feel for the characters.  The problem with this book is the semi-philosophical ranting, it was just irating to read, and he keeps doing it all though the novel.  I can take it if it happens once or twice, but the thing is just littered with it.  It breaks the momentum of the book, something happens, something else is about to, but first you have to push though three pages of these conjectures.  That's the other problem with this book, the building of suspense is just that he talks about something else for awhile.  Something is about to happen, and then he'll flash to a childhood memory, or moralize about society, or whatever...arghhhhh.  I don't recommend this book.
0553106635|5.0|I left of reading Robert Jordan's Wheel of time series to reread Martin's &quot;a Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. The differences were all in the favour of aSoIaF (pardon me, but I won't keep writing the full title). Robert Jordan writes myths and legends, the characters are set in roles, and it seemed to me that they stayed true to those roles. Giving the series the same feel as the lord of the rings.  aSoIaF is more real and is written in a style I have never before come across in any fantasy books before. aSoIaF was (apparently) written to emulate the War of the Roses with a fantasy element there, but not obstructing reality. Therefore when someone picks up any of the books one finds oneself in a world harsher than today, a world more akin to middle ages england than today. <br />There are roles laid out for characters in aSoIaF, but whether a character is playing a good or bad role isn't certain and some roles seem most neutral. Often one will find oneself disliking a character only to have them change roles while remain in character, and from that point you find yourself liking him, or her.  If there is one fualt, the books are not published nearly fast enough for my satisfaction, Once the series has finished I'll still wish for more.
B00003CXMG|2.0|Cameron Crowe's affectionate autobiography will make anyone who grew up in the 70's feel a tug at their heartstrings as they remember their first Rock Concert. Beyond that this movie never really goes beyond its feel good veneer settling for contrived situations, cliches and familiar manufactured endings - except for its cant miss soundtrack, Cameron's good times dont quite translate to film.
B0000399WI|5.0|However, I honestly cant say if Ive seen a better acted movie in my life. Even the secondary and tertiary characters are perfect. The passage of time is crucial to this film and thats why its long, and I dont mind a bit. It is a beautiful movie(saying a lot, since its about a prison)and the ending is amazing. I cannot believe that anyone who loves movies would call this movie 'overlong'. It is just about the best made movie that Ive see. Period.
0783240287|5.0|This edition of Joseph achieves exactly what it sets out to do.  It was designed as a musical with broad appeal, with something for everyone.  Lloyd Webber and Rice succeeded at several different styles of music in this musical (country, pop, disco, 60's rock, calypso).  I challenge you to name another musical with the same attributes.<br />However, for me, the real sell in this video comes in the performances of Donny Osmond and Maria Friedman.  In relating a story, Friedman is a most convincing narrator because of her remarkable facial expressions.  She makes the story seem new and fresh with each viewing.  Granted, she may not be the most gifted vocalist in the musical market, but I would rather be moved by the authenticity of the storytelling.  Donny Osmond is perfectly cast as the youthful, naive and honest Joseph.  <br />This video is taking a beating from some, and getting raves from others.  I belong to the latter group and would recommend this to anyone.
B000002NJS|5.0|I believe this is her best album to date. This album is a burst fresh air and a definate soul search on Madonna's part. She seems to have this amazing ability to put into words the transormation from Pop Queen to lyrical genius. Madonna has an un-selfish approach to these lyrics and has shown a side to her that has not been expressed by her before. Maybe it is motherhood, but she has really put her heart and soul into this album and has shown a different side to her. I think it is the more &quot;human&quot; less Pop Goddess side. This is truly a masterpiece and an amazing addition to my CD collection.
B00004X01U|1.0|Where are gone the days when Madonna used to make great pop classics such as 'Material Girl','Vogue' or 'Deeper &amp; Deeper'.... Definitly one of her worst attempts at reinventing herself,Madonna has made a tuneless boring album with 10 (11 if you count American Pie) middle-of-the-road tracks that really aren't anywhere as good as her previous stuff....Apart from 'Music' which is really not bad, the album doesn't offer much, 'Nobody's Perfect' and 'What it feels like...' are monotone electonica-orientated songs, 'Impressive instant' and 'Runaway lover' sound like 'Ray of light'rejects , and the rest is just really bad.....Madonna has gone too far, maybe it is time for her to just go back to basics, to her tuneful pop songs days.... Or she should start considering making Bee Gees or Abba covers.....
076790382X|5.0|What a delightful collection of insightful essays!<br />Prepare to recognize yourself, fears and joys alike, skewered in this delightful anthology of  concise essays. Bryson examines his own baffling and sometimes terrifying encounters with computer technicians, plumbers, salesman, and public relations experts who overwhelm with attitude and jargon. This collection would make an excellent house-warming - and apt warning - for any new homeowner. The essays \\"Help\\" \\"Design Flaws\\" \\"How to Have Fun at Home\\" \\"Deck the Halls\\" and \\"A Slight Inconvenience\\" illuminate some of the less pleasant aspects of contemporary daily life.<br />Yet Bryson also summons his dark wit on odd, yet potent, social absurdities. In \\"The Risk Factor\\", Bryson compares the perils of living in the United States with some other advanced countries with some surprising insights (there is almost no danger to secondhand smoking) and predictable rants (guns usually kill people the owner knows... and often loves). Perhaps the man loves statistics because he also wrote another witty  essay on weird ways people injure themselves in \\"Well, Doctor, I Was Just Trying to Lie Down.\\" His inspiration? Scanning the Statistical Abstract of the United States.<br />Along the way, Bryson celebrates Thanksgiving (The Best American Holiday), offers utopian suggestions for a better world (Rules for Living), puzzles over the growing perception that America is over crowded (Wide Open Spaces) and worries about sedentary habits of his fellow citizens (Why No One Walks.)<br />While some may one to linger over each essay, I read almost the entire book in a single, very satisfying afternoon on the beach. Either way, this book's a winner.<br />So indulge yourself, buy this book, and prepare to smile and laugh.
B00000I07R|5.0|With 1988's NEW JERSEY, Bon Jovi showed that selling 10 million copies of their 1986 blockbuster SLIPPERY WHEN WET didn't make them a one-trick pony. In fact, as many of their '80s metal brethren were falling by the wayside as the 1990s began, Bon Jovi was still riding high, touring in support of NEW JERSEY well into the opening months of 1990. But as that tour ended, tensions were beginning to run high in the band, and Bon Jovi temporarily separated to do their own things. Jon Bon Jovi helped create the soundtrack to the movie YOUNG GUNS II, and had a solo #1 hit with the Oscar-nominated &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;. Guitarist Richie Sambora proved he was not just Jon's second fiddle with his highly-underrated album STRANGER IN THIS TOWN. By 1992, the party line on Bon Jovi was that they had quitely broken up. But when KEEP THE FAITH finally appeared later in the year, Bon Jovi proved they weren't dead, just in hibernation. 1992 was the year that alternative changed popular music forever, and simply put, the nothin'-but-a-good-time attitude of '80s metal was made obsolete almost immediately. Even so, Bon Jovi was a few notches above, say, Motley Crue, so the transition into the '90s was to be quite an easy one for Bon Jovi, and KEEP THE FAITH showed them move from hard-rock to heartland-rock. The latter was shown perfectly on the 10-minute epic &quot;Dry County&quot;. Written solely by Jon, his tendency for Springsteen-like working class anthems came to its fruition here with that rare 10-minute song that doesn't outstay its welcome. Like any of Bob Dylan's famous story-length songs, it's all about lyrics and storytelling, without a mammoth solo to be found. Of course, the songwriting was the first thing to be matured in the band's 1990's transition, and KEEP THE FAITH is by far Bon Jovi's most adult record to date. Even the hits were above the old hard-rock standard of sexist rockers and sappy love ballads. The top 10 &quot;Bed Of Roses&quot; was indeed a love song, but Jon's lyricism is what shines here, with words that no average self-respecting '80s hard rock band could have possibly made work. &quot;In These Arms&quot; was not as lyrically beautiful as &quot;Bed Of Roses&quot;, but it was still romantic enough to win over Bon Jovi's numerous female fans. It was the title track that showed their old fans that they could write more than just another love song or good-time rocker. Like &quot;Dry County&quot;, &quot;Keep The Faith&quot; was a Springsteen-inspired number that demonstrated Bon Jovi's working-class identity in spite of their worldwide success. Other songs on KEEP THE FAITH that broke their just-for-the-teenage-girls status include &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;I'll Sleep When I'm Dead&quot;, &quot;Blame It On The Love Of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, and the wonderfully-titled &quot;If I Was Your Mother&quot;. While KEEP THE FAITH may have been called by some people as too self-assured and pretentious when it was released, it proved that Bon Jovi may have been the only band from the fad-laden '80s that seriously wanted to move forward with their music, for better or worse. Strangely, though the 1990s would be the least productive for Bon Jovi, as the bad vibes from the NEW JERSEY era continued to persist, and would lead to one band member leaving the group, and the band yet again separating to go solo. Eventually, Bon Jovi worked out their differences and they're now back on each other's good sides, but KEEP THE FAITH shows that Bon Jovi had every intention of staying in for the long haul.but Jon's lyricism is what shines here, with words that no average self-respecting '80s hard rock band could have possibly made work. &quot;In These Arms&quot; was not as lyrically beautiful as &quot;Bed Of Roses&quot;, but it was still romantic enough to win over Bon Jovi's numerous female fans.

B000002MZ6|4.0|I was introduced to this title through a friend and has be- come one of my most used cd`s.  The term &quot;tone poem&quot; most fits here as their is a recurring theme through-out.  It is easy on the ears and the many changes in the background keeps me interested.  The video that was released with the&quot; Let their be light&quot; segment is a neat piece of animation.
B000053V9F|4.0|This movie was very good.  The movie expressed theorys of JFKs assassination, but not all truth.  The movie had a TON of bad language, sex, and violence, but it was fun to watch and very interesting, too!
B000002UAO|5.0|This was the first Beatles album I ever bought so it has a very special place in my heart.  It is what got me into them and I do not believe there is a single bad song on this album!<br />Among my favourites there is I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOU,  THINK FOR YOURSELF, THE WORD, GIRL, and NORWEGIAN WOOD.  Of course all the song are awesome but mainly focus on rock 'n roll.<br />Personally I suggest you GET THIS ALBUM!!!  You will not be disappointed believe me!  This is one of the Beatles finest works and remains one of my favourite albums.
B00003CXMG|4.0|Myself, like many others, counted down the days until March 13th arrived.  Cameron Crowes &quot;Almost Famous&quot; has reassured me that this talanted director creates films unlike all others.  There is always SOMETHING unique about every movie this man has been a part of.  With Almost Famous, I had a constant 2-hour smile on my face, at the same time remembering a bunch of adolescent memories like my first girlfriend, my first kiss, the first time I got to experience real freedom away from home.  And I am sure I'm not alone here, because what made this film so wonderful is that it has provoked similar memories in those that saw this wonderful film.  OK, let's talk about this DVD.  As soon as I received mine, I immediately looked on the back for the 'extra features.'  Let me make this clear before I start my review, there is NO COMMENTARY and there is NO 30 MINUTES OF EXTRA FOOTAGE.  From what I hear, Cameron Crowe was too busy working on his next film to spend time on this DVD release.  So, I'm expecting a FUTURE release of this film with all those extras many of us were hoping for.  However, I DO recommend getting this DVD in its current state, because simply, it's just a GREAT film!  OK...NOW back to the DVD.  I opened the case up and was introduced to an attractive looking DVD with a picture of the cast on the DVD.  The pamphlet inside is nothing special.  It has 3 behind-the-scenes photos and a little background on the making of the film.  It also has chapter listings.  I popped the DVD into my player and was pleasantly surprised by the menu design, very easy navigation with eye popping moving menus and colors, all displayed with the background music of Stillwater.  The 'main menu' has a choice of 'special features', 'scene index',  'audio options' and 'subtitles'.  Under 'special features', you have the choice of watching an HBO special on the making of Almost Famous, the theatrical trailer and the &quot;Fever Dog&quot; music video.  You can also view production notes, cast and crew biographies and Rolling Stone articles written by the director.  The &quot;Making Of&quot; special is a nice look into the film, with interviews by many cast members.  Nothing we haven't seen before, but still nice to have.  The &quot;Fever Dog&quot; video is pretty bad.  Yes, it contains a few cuts not seen in the film, but 3/4 of it seems out of sync.  (I'm an editor, I notice stuff like this).  The whole video resembled an old 'Godzilla' TV show after a while....oh well.  The 'scene index' is wonderful.  It has a title for each scene and moving menus which create a very attractive screen.  You have 3 'audio options'.  DTS Digital Surround, 5.1 Dolby Digital and 2.0 Dolby Digital.  You also have a choice of having English 'subtitles' on or off.  My favorite 'special feature' were the articles written by Cameron Crowe.  Reading these articles makes you realize what a terrific writer Cameron Crowe is, and how much of a pleasure it must be to read his scripts.  OK....now to the technical stuff about the movie. I was very VERY impressed with this beautiful anamorphic widescreen transfer.  The cinematography in this film is wonderful.  Colors are beautifully rendered, blacks are rich and the concert footage is gorgeous.  No complaints about picture quality, it is excellent.  The audio is also wonderful.  Although the dialogue is pretty much center channeled, the movie sounds far from monaural.  Ambience sounds are surrounding and the music is outstanding.  If you watch this on a surround system, the concert footage will envelope your ears and bring you right into the show.  I was even impressed with the audio on a 2 speaker system.  Your subwoofer will kick in during the concert footage, other then that, this film is not one to test your system out.  Having the dialogue strictly centered makes the concert footage EXPLODE!  The sound design is terrific, clean, clear and beautifully recorded.  (Yes, I found myself singing Tiny Dancer.....again!)In conclusion, Almost Famous is one of my favorite films from the past few years.  It's full of emotion and PERFECTLY casted with wonderful performance from all involved.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD.  I give the film 5 stars, but the DVD loses a star for lacking the footage we were all hoping for.  Go get this DVD if you want to smile  for 2 hours straight.  You'll find that you can't help but relive those early-teen memories while watching this film.  If you ARE a teen, trust me, you'll still enjoy this movie.  If you are of the older generation, who knows......I think you may love this film!  You'll laugh, cry and go through all the emotions a Cameron Crowe movie brings out of us.  Enjoy Almost Famous....and oh yeah....&quot;Don't do drugs!&quot;
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I bought this collection on vinyl, a 2 Lp set from England.  Included is a large poster and four photos of each Beatles by Richard Avedon.  Opening the album reminded me of opening my first copy of THE BEATLES/THE BEATLES(WHITE ALBUM).  The sound quality is excellent, digitally remastered and remixed.  Listening to this collection on vinyl is different than listening to the collection on compact disc.  True, both are digitally remastered but the sound of vinyl creates a sound truer to the original recordings.  If you are going to buy this collection, spend a little extra and buy The Beatles on vinyl.
B00003CXE6|3.0|I just finished watching Gladiator.  It's all right, but certainly not the great cinematic work it's being touted as.  It was remarkably like Ben Hur.  All it needed was Charlton Heston, a chariot race, and a few lepers.  The background music was less than subtle.  The music in itself was very nice, but the viewer gets beat over the head with the &quot;choir of angels&quot; bit.  I heard a great deal about Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the evil Commodus as well.  There were a few moments when he was very much like the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood:  Prince of Thieves.  Instead of saying &quot;I am vexed!&quot;, I was waiting for him to say, &quot;That's it!  Christmas is cancelled!&quot; (at least Alan Rickman was comical and enteratining as well as menacing).  I'm all about Russell Crowe in a skirt, but this just wasn't that great.  Those of us who have just sat through all two and a half hours of this ho-hum yawn-fest salute you......
B00004U45G|5.0|Crowes are tighter live band than zep ever was, anyone who has seen them can certainly attest to this, and jimmy page seems well surrounded here. The sound is loud and aggressive. The rythym section pounds out the songs effectively, chris robinson is oh-so perfect filling in for the leathery Robert Plant, and this sounds like an album any led-zeploid would dream of hearing at Led's peak. Only problem is that Jimmy has trouble keepin' up with all the energy, but that can be forgiven... after all he's jimmy! Don't listen to anyone who bashes this album; they're complete morons who never understood zep to begin with.
0345440757|5.0|I bought ordered this book a few days ago and I cannot believe what a difference it has made in our lives already.  I was totally missing my baby's cues for sleep and she was always cranky.  After applying E.A.S.Y. for just two days, I know when she wants to nap and now she eats(breastfeeds) every 3 to 3 1/2 hours, whereas before I always thought she was hungry.  It's like having a new baby!  times a day.  I would reccomend this book to every new or expecting mother!<br />P.S.  I wish I had this book 6 months ago!
B000002UDB|4.0|This is one of the Beatles most phycadelic albums ever produced.  Each song is very bizarre but still very good. Lennon says it was the finest album they ever made but I do not think so. However it is still awesome!!!<br />My favourites songs are THE FOOL ON THE HILL, BLUEJAY WAY, YOUR MOTHER SHOULD KNOW,I AM THE WALRUS, and I feel ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE delivers a beautiful message.<br />The only beef I have with this album is the lack of tracks only 11! Come on! Still now it is a fine album and worth the bucks!  Highly reccommended!!!
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie could almost have been my story. Like William Miller, the 15 year old lead character in Almost Famous, I too found myself immersed in the backstage world of the 70's concert scene. Unlike young Miller or Cameron Crowe (who the character was pretty much based on), I wasn't a writer, I sold vintage guitars to all the touring bands that hit Houston starting in 1974 but I too was only 15 and was basically the same wide-eyed kid. I remember `your name's not on the list' and being in love with a `band-aid' or two that only had eyes for the band members. This movie captures exactly the way it felt back then: the musicians, the road crews, the music, the girls, everything. I ended up being a guitar tech, then a road manager and finally a manager before I left the business a couple of years ago at age 40. Ironically for me, (you'll understand why after you've seen the movie) I was the tour manager for Steve Marriott's, Humble Pie from 1982 to 1985 but I don't think I ever won a girl in a poker game like Reg.<br />There were a lot of little details that made it very real for me. There's a shot of the band's tour manager when he introduces the band. After he finishes, the camera lingers on him for a bit and you get a feel for the amount of pressure this guy is under. This particular character wasn't really fleshed out that much in the movie so I was surprised to see this particular shot but I'm glad it didn't get cut.<br />The DVD quality is excellent on this one and bonuses include a `Making of' feature, original trailer, production notes and cast and crew details. The DVD also includes several full-length Rolling Stone articles written by Cameron Crowe in the `70's. About the only thing missing was a deleted scenes section.<br />Comedies like Still Crazy and Spinal Tap do a great job of lampooning this eras rock bands while still paying a sort of tribute and both are excellent movies but this movie falls into a category of its own. It took me back to what it was like in the very beginning when I first fell in love with rock and roll. Thanks for the trip down memory lane, Cameron.like in the very beginning when I first fell in love with rock and roll. Thanks for the trip down memory lane, Cameron.
0345440757|5.0|After getting the feeling that I may be creating bad sleep habits I ordered this book. I stayed up all night to read it while my husband was on baby duty. I now realize that I was not teaching my daughter how to fall asleep on her own. The book realyy breaks things down and I'm now able to read her cues and understand what her needs are. It's like having a new child! According to the chart in the book and I must agree, my little girl is a &quot;Spirited&quot; baby. Now instead of getting frustrated, I appreciate her so much more and can see her personality developing so clearly and she makes me laugh more than anything. This book gives me the confidence to be a great mother and I would reccomend it to every one! It makes a great shower gift and is easy to wrap/swaddle!
B00004XONN|5.0|Its a great CD.  I have to admit that the songs on OK computer grabbed my attention a lot more but I think they built on top of the OK Coomputer foundation and just went a little more into the electronic realm.  I like it though.
1889895032|4.0|Marlin fishing on the wall is presented well and keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat waiting for that next strike. The film shows you many things you can use when chasing Marlin, including knots, rigs, line, rods and reels. Theres also the first hit of the marlin and the giant leeping out of the water to free himself and that is what this film captures and makes anglers all over the world to try and chase these monsters of the deep. I wish the fim never ended.
B000002UZ1|4.0|This one is slightly better than the Red album but is basically just as good.  The tracks from this album concentrate on 1967-1970.  Their physicadelic era and the 1969-1970 Abbey Road era.  Some of the tracks on this album are just pure genius and should have been #1 hits.  HERE COMES THE SUN remains one of my favourites Beatles songs.<br />In conclusion this and the Red album are 2 great ways to get a good impression and feel of the Beatles for a music fan who wants to become a fan of them.  This still remains one of my favourites and is worth ever penny.
B000002NHN|4.0|I also strongly encourage listeners to check out albums by Caroline Lavelle and Emer Kenny which I've recently discovered. Loreena Mckennitt seems to have improved her sound from album to album and while it took sometime to grow on me, &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot; is indeed a very nice album filled with Celtic, folk and mid-eastern styles. <br />However, if you like Loreena you'll LOVE Emer Kenny. Her self-titled album features a bundle of harp melodies, ambient rhythms and an angelic voice that I think is even more beautiful than Loreena's. Caroline Lavelle is also superb. She even sings back-up on Mckennitt's live in Paris and Toronto album and has toured with her. Her album &quot;Spirit&quot; is so beautiful and enchanting, similar to this but with a more deep and romantic sound. <br />I realize Loreena Mckennitt became very well-known with her hit &quot;Mummer's Dance&quot;, but there are so many other artist which are just as good or better waiting to be discovered.
6305603847|5.0|If you're here, you know about the movie.  I bought it for the good trasnfer of the film (and it IS VERY GOOD).  What makes this film superior is all the additional material on it.  A couple good documentaries, new 5.1 audio, previously unreleased film footage, running commentary, couple different subtitles (one for regular subtitles and one for the lyrics to the songs!!!).  There's even audio stuff and diagrams to set your audio system up.  ALL DVD's SHOULD BE PRODUCED LIKE THIS.  CRITERION COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER!!!
0618001905|5.0|I agree with so many of the reviewers previous who praised this book.  It's a monumental piece of writing, besides being a fervent indictment of the colonialist mind.  The indictment is made without reserve, its scaffolding always present, and there's genuine intellect around the pages.  I remain astonished at the efficiency of the prose; Hochschild leads a heady charge to the middle of what these things mean, his own humanity in full array. It really is masterful.  I would only add-- make no mistake, the key to this book lies in the way Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' is brought to heel, by subtle and instructive means, especially in the chapter 'Meet Mr. Kurtz.'  It is from THAT place of intense truth, as from a hot central core, that this book spins out its dreadful tale.  Page after page, one is stung anew at learning the exactly dissected layers of these creatures-- Leopold, Stanley, these monsters feeding from a decadent culture, one already in decline, though none but soothsayer knew it then.  The prose is as clean and free as the story it reveals is filthy and made of oppression;  I think that clash has a great deal to do with how affording an experience reading this book is.  It's a book of sorrow, nothing really has prepared one for it; but Hochschild works a kind of love over this book, and the rewards are immense.  Recommendation, no reservation.
B000002UAR|5.0|Every song on this album seems to have it's own story.  This remains one of the Beatles finest albums ever!  So many different types songs and an awesome album cover  art!<br />Although I like all the songs there are a few that stand out including TAXMAN(an awesome rock song!), ELEANOR RIGBY and I'M ONLY SLEEPING(two beautiful songs) as well as the physcadelic LOVE YOU TO and the country-like ballad FOR NO ONE these remain my favourites.<br />This album is worth a lot in my mind and if you want diverse Beatles music get this cd!!!  It remains one of their finest pieces of musical work...ever! So get it if you know what is good for you!
B000002H97|5.0|When I bought this album several years ago, I didn't know I was getting one of the best albums of all time.  This album has EVERYTHING, from heavy and loud (&quot;Enter Sandman&quot;), all the way to soft, quiet, and melodic (&quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;).  Personally, I like Nothing Else Matters (I can even play the whole song on my guitar!); This song has such a great melody, that when I listen to it, I get chills down my spine (good chills!). It is a song that really makes you relax and enjoy the amazing melody.  I could fall asleep to that song (not because it's boring, but because the melody is so intriguing and relaxing). I just wonder how long it took the members to make that song, being so (dare I say?) perfect.  Believe me, you will not regret it.  I know what it's like to buy crappy, worthless CDs, and I also know what it's like to be amazed at how well your money was spent whenever you buy an extraordinary CD.  This CD is the latter.  If you don't have this CD, do yourself a favor and buy this CD!
B000002GKT|3.0|The good news: Humble Pie could outplay Grand Funk Railroad - opening for whom the Pie made their rep, after two early and badly underappreciated albums melding quiet rock (without forgetting the \\"rock\\" side of it) with crunchy rock - on their (the Pie's, that is) worst night. The bad news: Just how much better than Grand Funk did you have to be to outplay them?    According to \\"Rockin' The Fillmore,\\" about all you really needed was a lead guitarist with a little less self-consciousness, which in Peter Frampton the Pie had to spare. His sleek, jazzy solos and fills stood out brightly from the rest of the burgeoning run of boogie-till-you-plotzers as the 60s crossed into the 70s. He didn't have a half bad rhythm section to play over and through, either, in bassist Greg Ridley and drummer Jerry Shirley. What he didD have, though, was Steve Marriott for a frontman, who didn't know the meaning of the word subtlety anymore (compare his Pie work to his earlier work fronting the Small Faces) and who substituted bombast for genuine soul, not to mention delivering, arguably, the most insufferably chauvinistic rambleogue in the history of British rock by way of the superfluous (and unlistenable) version of \\"Rollin' Stone\\" which appears here.    That, on the original LP, took up side three; a hard rock jam version of Dr. John's hoodoo psychedelic soul classic, \\"I Walk On Guilded Splinters,\\" took up side two, and probably told people that this kind of thing was probably best left (reference \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" or \\"The Green Mandalishi\\") to Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac. I had often said in years past that sides one and four would have made one hell of a fun album. That opinion holds even now, since you'd have to go through an awful lot of contortion to deny that \\"Four Day Creep,\\" \\"Stone Cold Fever,\\" and \\"Hallelujah, I Love Her So\\" are good harmless fun, and they actually crank it up a legitimate notch (Marriott sounds like he's beating his rhythm guitar into submission; bassist Greg Ridley and drummer Jerry Shirley sound like they're handing him the whips gleefully) and rock the living hell out of \\"I Don't Need No Doctor.\\" Do yourself a favour, though - when it comes to \\"I'm Ready,\\" just skip Marriott's opening hectoring and cut right to the chase, unless, of course, mouthy pipsqueaks who think they were gospel shouters in their previous lives are a staple in your diet.
B0000062S0|4.0|When I first heard Jimmy and Robert were producing original material together for the first time since the break-up of the mighty Led Zeppelin, I winced.  After all, we've seen the old-rockers-try-again formula before, and it usually doesn't work.  But Plant and Page avoid that pitfall with a meticulously crafted album that shows they still care.  Radio hit &quot;Most High&quot; takes the long-standing interest in Middle Eastern sounds to new heights, while &quot;Please Read the Letter&quot; and the title track experiment with very cool arrangements and innovative structures.  &quot;When the World Was Young&quot; is one of the more vibrant and complete tracks.  &quot;Upon a Golden Horse&quot; and &quot;Burning Up&quot; rock, though Robert's voice shows a little wear here and there.  Most Zeppelin moment: The first touch of the guitar shortly into &quot;Blue Train&quot; - my favorite track -- is unmistakable Page, and the ensuing effort could be &quot;Tea for One&quot; Part II.  Second Zep moment:  &quot;Shine in the Light&quot; sounds like a cross between &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Poor Tom,&quot; yet stands beautifully on its own.  Overall this is not Led Zeppelin, but of course it could never be.  The whole is greater than the sum of its parts though, and like Plant's own first solo effort, &quot;Pictures at Eleven,&quot; this CD is not a classic but it's quite solid.  I'd put &quot;Clarksdale&quot; above anything Page has done post-Zep, and right up their with Robert's best solo jaunts.
B000002UYZ|4.0|This is a great compilation of Beatles tracks from 1962-1966.  It mainly concentrates on the 1964 Beatlemania era but also has a wide collection of  songs from Rubber Soul however it lacks enough tracks from 1966 (which had some great Beatles songs recorded at the time!)<br />I would reccommend this album to a fan who wants to get into the Beatles.  It covers quite a bit but lacks any 1966 tracks.  Still definetly worth it! Remains one of my favourites!
B00000JCOV|4.0|Before Slipknot, the only metal i had ever listened to was bits of Static-X and Rammstein. Although i thought it was pretty cool i didn't think it was for me. Then i picked up this CD on a recommendation from a friend. Wow. This CD literally took me by the hair and yanked me around as soon as Track 2 hit. I can not get enough of it. I listen to it while I do my homework, while i'm walking home from school, eating, or just relaxing. This CD is that good. I don't really care about anyone who says that 'oh this isn't real metal' screw that good music is good music. I advise all of you to pick this CD up at once- unless you really really hate rock (in which case i'd have to question your sanity or identify you as a teeny-bopper) this CD will convert you. It sure as hell converted me, and i love this stuff now.<br />It got a 4 because i felt that the CD, while very good, wasn't up to a five-star standard. Some songs got kind of boring, but the majority rocked. In the end, this is more like a 4.5, but it's not perfect so i'll give it a four.
0446310786|5.0|This novel is one of the greatest modern American novels.  It deals with one of the most pressing modern issues which is race.  The story is told by an adult Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, who is looking back on the period on her childhood from age 6-9.  Harper Lee first introduces us to all the eccentric souls that inhabit Maycomb County in order to give us an idea of how this town operates.  At the beginning of the novel everyone seems like pretty decent people, but we see who are the truly noble people in town when Tom Robinson, a black man is accused of raping a poor white woman.  Scout's father defends Tom in a trial scene that has probably inspired numerous people to become lawyers. Scout is an excellent and winning narrator as the tomboy who refuses to grow up and who is considerable smarter than her peers and clear eyed than the adults around her (with the exceptions of her father and Miss Maudie).  Lee wraps you up in southern small town warmth and childhood misadventures that ring universal until dropping her bombshell of a trial.  How that trial affects Scout and her older brother Jem and their perceptions of the world and of their town is a focal point of the novel.  By the end of the novel, you know that regardless of their ages that their childhoods have virtually ended and they have experienced evil and have seen the evils that people can visit on one another.

0684853523|4.0|Even if you don't like to read Stephen King novels, you can read this book and get helpful tips for your writing.  I've read a few of his books including Needfull Things and The Bachman Books and didn't care for the length or the gore.  However, I can respect his writing in addition to his readership that spans the world.  I was curious about this book, and wondered if it would help me to write that great american novel.  I skimmed the book more for writing information rather than his personal accounts, some of which i found interesting.  I did pick up helpful tips for my writing.  Changing the gender of a character is an important tip and will definatly help my writing block.  This is just one of a few tips in this book.  Mr. King is a facinating character himself and reading how he made Misery or Carrie will definately help me with my own character sketches.  And, after reading this book, I think I am going to try reading one of his novels again and be able to use a more critical eye to the style.  So, even if you don't care for his books at all, reading or skimming this book can give you a new appreciation for his creativity and authorship.  Thank you Mr. King!
B00004TLMC|5.0|Fans of Tom Cruise who are expecting an action movie will be sorely disappointed by Kubrick's burning, slow-paced, expressionistic look into sexual repression and desire.  On the other hand, fans of art-house movies should be enthralled by the lush sets, exquisite costumes, and psychosexual drama.  Sections of the film seem to hint at the &quot;one desperate man outwits the evil organization&quot; role that Cruise plays in &quot;The Firm&quot;, but Kubrick is interested in ideas and feelings, not action and violence, so the lack of a clear-cut resolution is really quite understandable; real life problems seldom offer easy answers.  At an opulent party, a handsome young doctor's beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman) dances flirtatiously with a distinguished gentleman while her husband deals with a medical emergency.  Afterwards, they have an argument that reveals their mutual frustrations.  Bill claims that he is never jealous because he knows that women desire the comfort and security that comes with commitment.  At the same time he tells his wife that he would never have sex with other women because doing so would hurt her.  This infuriates her, because it makes her feel that she is being held responsible for his sexual repression, (a condition we are unaware of at the time, but which becomes very clear during the next hour of the film, as Bill finds himself faced with a series of sexual opportunities), and so she rather spitefully apprises him of her own carnal desire for a young naval officer.  Obsessed and threatened by the idea that his wife has the same kind of sexual desires that men have, Bill sets off on the sometimes bizarre psychological journey that comprises the central section of the film.  As we follow Bill through the next couple of days, we see a number of attractive women come on to him, in a series of more and more exciting scenarios, but in every case, he not only remains in control, but in the long run, decides to do nothing.  It does seem, however, that he becomes more active as the element of risk increases; Kubrick is trying to show us how danger and unfamiliarity are intertwined with sexuality.  Of course the downside of danger is that one sometimes gets burned, as we see demonstrated repeatedly.  Bill's problem is that he craves the adventure of risk-taking, but is ultimately too responsible and has too much to lose. The paralysis this conflict causes is brilliantly dramatized - realistically in the scene with the prostitute (and its chilling sequel), and expressionistically in the orgy scene, where Bill never really does anything except get warned, threatened, exposed, and ostracized.  Meanwhile, his wife has had a dream in which she has sex with other men in front of her husband, and laughs at him to show her disdain.  Although she finds the dream upsetting, it shows that she is also torn between her love for her husband, and a need for more sexual freedom.  The climax, when Bill finds her sleeping with the mask, can be taken on two levels, but psychologically, this scene shows Bill's realization that she's been sleeping with the mask all along; he hasn't let her in to his innermost thoughts and desires, but has always worn this mask of confident professional detachment and disinterest, and he finally understands how much this has hurt her.  The flickering back and forth between realism and expressionism will displease many, and it is certainly the film's greatest flaw as well as its strength, but to those who are willing to delve past the literal world to the subtle ideas beneath, Kubrick provides an unforgettable window into some of the deepest recesses of the human soul.at he becomes more active as the element of risk increases; Kubrick is trying to show us how danger and unfamiliarity are intertwined with sexuality.

On this one,  Trent gives a full-throttle, pedal to the metal, rage fest that grabs you by the throat and slams you to the floor.

0783243499|3.0|Watching American Psycho was one of the most unnerving cinematic experiences I've ever been through (the 1997 German-made film Funny Games (subtitled) being the most tramatic for me). A satire of the materialism and the &quot;me-ism&quot; of the 80's? OK. A dark comedy?? I hardly think so, at least not in the way dark comedy is supposed to work. The movie tries to be too many things to the point that ultimately, it failed for me. It tries satire, horror, psychological &quot;probing&quot; for answers, (although this is understated) unanswered questions, surprise; in short, everything seems thrown into the mix. And even with all of the film's ability to transfix viewers by the sheer audacity of the plot and its execution (seriously, no pun intended), however horrific, I just felt sick to my stomach and VERY depressed when it ended. NOTHING is funny about torture and murder, whatever the context, unless it's explicitly clear FROM THE START AND WITHOUT A DOUBT that dark comedy is the goal (i.e. the late Paul Bartel's 1982 flick Eating Raoul comes to mind).<br />As a male I found the film repugnant and offensive, especially by the cavalier way that sex, brutality, and murder are depicted. Without ignoring the fact that Bale's character is quite sick, whether the acts were actually committed or just in his diseased mind, the film disturbes on a more basic level because it reinforces the notion that men get pleasure from violent sex, from wielding power over women, and just that men can't be trusted, period. Not one male character in the film is depicted in a positive way. Women have plenty enough images of these sick, sadistic men; women are already terrified enough of these men and of the horrifying chances of encountering them. At times I felt the film bordered on an indictment of all male behavior when it comes to sex and power over others. OK, maybe I'm overstating my case here, but that's just how unpleasant the film came off to me (obviously, not that it was supposed to be pleasant), and as such, I just can't buy the notion of dark comedy. Watch with a critical mind--this film plays with viewers in a most unsettling way.

B000002AH7|5.0|Sketches of Spain is Miles Davis follow up to the brilliant Kind Of Blue. While Kind Of Blue may be the greatest jazz album ever made, Sketches of Spain is really close. It is at least a worthy follow up to Kind Of Blue. While Kind Of Blue had a very private sound with only a few musicians, Sketches Of Spain is a huge album, with many musicians. The effect you get from listening to this is the same as listening to a full orchestra. <br />As the title suggests, the songs on here are spanish or spanish influenced songs. However, it is not too Latin sounding and not too jazz sounding. It is very in between, which makes the album even more brilliant and different. I think that the highlight of the album is the stunning 16 minute Concierto De Aranjuez. It is like a jazz symphony, but with Latin influences. Albums like this proove that Miles Davis is just as important to jazz as Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington.

B00004TA41|5.0|Instellar space is another brilliant album by one of the most important figures in jazz and music history. The influence of John Coltrane cannot be overstated. There is something very different about Interstellar Space then any other of Coltrane's albums. This album was his last album. It was recorded in 1967, but not released right away. There are only two musicians on the entire album. Rashied Ali, the brilliant drummer and a perfect counterpart to John Coltrane's incredible saxophone playing. The album is a very avant garde album and may not be understood by everyone. The original album has four songs, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. Each song is like a jazz suite to the planet. Mars is adventurous and often quiet. venus is warm and beautiful. Jupiter is explosive and intense. Saturn is rhythmic and soft. This CD also hads the great Leo and another take of Jupiter called Jupiter variation. It is really hard to pick which of these songs is the best, but I think that Mars may be my personal favorite. Overall, this is a brilliant album by a brilliant person.

B000003TAW|5.0|weezer is the best band of the 1990's. this might sound like pure blasphemy to fans of nirvana, pearl jam (which i also am) or other bands; one thing that makes them so brilliant is they cannot simply be categorized; they are punk rock, alternative, emo, grunge, and pop all rolled into one awesome musical outfit.<br />this disc, though not the musical masterpiece that indie rockers see in pinkerton, is great from the first riff of 'my name is jonas', to the powerful conclusion of 'only in dreams'; it is poppy, powerful, and incredibly addictive; it is almost impossible to remove it from your cd player; every song is good; 'say it ain't so' is maybe the greatest ballad for teen angst ever, and 'in the garage' a gateway to the nerd in all of us; hey, lets not lie here, we all played dungeons and dragons; in my opinion, 'buddy holly' is the worst track (they've ever written) on the cd, despite being a very good pop song. 'the world has turned' is beautiful, and 'no one else' sounds cheery, but is very deep and emotional as well, and 'my name is jonas' is  almost punk, just pure rock energy; <br />thinking back to my teenage years (i got this CD when i was 11) and loved it, but got somewhat burnt out by it; then i lost it for a little while (isnt it an odd coincidence that so many reviewers have phsically lost this cd and then found it again, anyways...), but when i found it again in tenth grade, it kinda clicked and made me listen to it over and over again; there aren't many cd's like this, rivers cuomo is a musical genius, and if you don't think so, listen to the song 'jamie' by weezer; <br />the musically more mature pinkerton is my personal favorite, but weezer is not far behind; and oh yes, they are coming back! new cd coming out by end of 2001; please see them live, they're amazing and its an experience when every person in the crowd knows and sings along with every lyric, =w= forever.

B000056K04|2.0|I was immediately wary when the name Glen Ballard was dropped into the equaiton. It is not that he is a bad producer, his work with Alanis Morrisette should answer that, but what he has done with the Dave Matthews Band, is a little sad. I seems that Ballard has completely overshadowed this album, and has managed to blunt that edge that made DMB, one of the most original and musically exciting bands of the last decade. I think the idea of Dave using an electric guitar is not a bad one, but some how something here has gone amiss. There is no longer the distinctiveness of the Lillywhite Albums, instead a more glossy hollywoody wall of music.<br />From the follow up to Before These Crowed Streets, I eagerly anticipated the genius tunes that I thought were coming. It is a very big leap of faith to jump to Everyday, which to be honest from the timescale also seems to have been rather too hasitly put together. Having not heard the tunes from the recent tours, living in europe doesn't offer much of , I would like, as I'm sure many others would, like to hear the Lillywhite sessions that were scrapped.<br />If this was not DMB this album wouldn't be too bad, there are some good tunes such as Sleep to Dream Her... and of course it is Dave and the boyz.<br />I was expecting great things from this album but just as the title suggests it is just everyday not some thing special.
0790733897|5.0|This classic cop thriller starring Steve McQueen helped define the \\"cool cop\\" genre, along with the Dirty Harry movies and a few others such as the original \\"Shaft\\". It is amazing just how well this epic tale has aged, for watching it one is not really very aware of the decades that have passed other than by the dress and car styles apparent in the movie.  Here the cop anti-hero character is well honed into being a dark, moody, but very personable loner who also happens to have one of the loveliest screen paramours ever in a very young and desirable Jacqueline Bisset. This was before her turn in &quot;Summer of '42&quot;, and she was a literal unknown at the time. She certainly caught a few eyes with her turn here as the girlfreind caught in the middle of Bullitt's violence.<br />Of course, for those us of struggling through our undergraduate school years at the time, the real star of the film was McQueen's throaty high-performance British racing green Ford Cobra Mustang. In what many consider the finest car chase sequence ever filmed, McQueen relentlessly and recklessly pursues the super-charged Dodge Charger in a drive to the death (ah, back when cars really rattled the pavement with their sheer horsepower and all that testosterone rumbled down the street!). Can we all say muscle car perfection? One recalls the terrific sounds of all those upshifts and downshifts as McQueen, who insisted on doing his own stunt-driving here, careened dangerously at high speeds through the streets of San Francisco in pursuit of the bad guys.<br />The film unrolls with a tight, interestingly written, and well-directed story, one that interweaves money, crime, politics, and suspense in a script that could as easily fall from today's headlines as from those populating the newspapers of thirty years ago when \\"Bullitt\\" was filmed. Detective Frank Bullitt (McQueen) is assigned for the weekend to protect a witness for a local hearing by one of California's senators (Robert Vaughn) the next Monday. When mob hit men fatefully interrupt such well-laid plans, the plot spins into overdrive, and a masterful cat and mouse game ensues. The supporting cast is terrific, and the hit men are well played with deadpan bad guy grimaces and suitable grunts and groans. These guys really seem both evil and professional. And yet the duel between McQueen and the hit men serves only to introduce us into the nuances and undercurrents in the plot, which Bullitt must somehow unravel to solve the crime and rescue himself from the aftermath. This is a terrific movie, and one you must see in DVD and a large screen to truly appreciate. Enjoy!t Monday.

I've loved all of Dave Matthew's previous albums, but I was getting a little worn out since like 3 releases had a bunch of the same songs, but done in different venues.  Great stuff, though.  <br />I thought Everyday was very plain.  There wasn't much that I wanted to sing or groove to.  They've had so much time to come up with new material and what they came up with just didn't do it for me.  Excellent background music, but that's about it.

B000002GWJ|5.0|It's almost impossible for anyone to ever write a bad review of Tom Waits and be taken seriously. To even attempt it is foolish. There's a good reason for that. The stuff is the work of genius. They can't make songs better. From the opening cover song to the last note this album has weight. It conjures up images of rain soaked streets and ancient battleship cars with stained vinyl interiors. It feels like common hope. There isn't the usual pompous angels of characters. These are not cookie cutter barbie doll pop iconography. These are exotic dancers, mean little kids, common thugs, every rotten thing you've ever done or thought and all of the hope and longing that pulls us up at the end of every day. I'm in love with the tune Kentucky Avenue. There's the classic Christmas Card from a Hooker... This isn't an album. It doesn't play like a movie. It's a mighty powerful force, an old photo album, the first car you remember your dad driving. It's great and Tom has no equal.
B000001GXJ|4.0|Piero Cappucilli has a beautiful voice, but his expression hasalways been a bit wooden. As a result, although his Simon soundsgreat, he gives us little insight into Verdi's most complex baritonecharacter. For that you have to go to Tito Gobbi and his incomparableinterpretation on the recently rereleased EMI recording. Freni hasreceived a lot of praise for her performance here; although she's ingood voice, I find her character a bit too frantic. I prefer..., whichfor me has the right balance of calm and urgency. Nicolai Ghiaurov isvery good here as Fiesco, but Boris Christoff, again in the EMIrecording, is magnificent. Still, this recording has considerablestrengths. Carreras is outstanding as Gabriele, Claudio Abbado's tautcontrol of the score is superb, and the sound is wonderful. The dramaat the end of the Prologue and in the Council Chamber scene have neverbeen better conveyed. Here the EMI recording falls flat; Santini isinsufficiently urgent, and the sound is mediocre, with the orchestraset a bit too far backward. If you want great direction and sound, getthis version; if you want great singing/acting in the lead roles, getthe EMI.  Better yet, get both.
0679879269|5.0|If by some chance of fate, I knew beforehand I would be stranded on a desert island, i would be sure to bring along this stunning trilogy. Not only is it beautifly written, Philip pulman makes us search within our self to question our beliefs. I found myself inquiring whether there is or ever was a god. I found myself inquiring what my deamon would be. I found myself inquiring what i would have done if i were Lyra. I think everyone should read this book to inquire about themeselves.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The first time I saw this film I was at a very difficult time in my life, but this film helped me look at the world in a completely different manner.  Of course there are several different themes woven into the story, the one that stood out to me was the idea of beauty in the world.  This film taught me that I shouldn't focus all my attention into just one thing because there is so much beauty in the world that to lock onto just one thing means you block everything else out.  This frame of mind allows you to live life to the fullest by not missing out on the glorious world that surrounds us.  From the moment the film ended the first time, I was in love with the script, cinematography, direction, and acting.  However, it wasn't until I bought American Beauty on DVD did I realize how much of an artist Sam Mendes really is.  Through his commentary and storyboard review with cinematographer Conrad Hall you begin to understand the technique he took in handling this story.  I'm looking forward to his next project, whatever it will be.
B000059R8Y|3.0|Eric Clapton's new album, &quot;Reptile&quot; represents a trip down memory lane for the artist, but unfortunately, not his audience. The music is easy on the ear, very accessible, and over all a good listen, but there is little evidence of the guitar virtuoso that made his legend. No new ground is broken here.  Two cuts do stand above the rest: &quot;I Ain't Gonna Stand For It&quot; and &quot;Superman Inside&quot;.  Otherwise, it's mostly ear candy.  Sweet to listen to, but not very filling.
0345440757|5.0|I saw an add in the NY Times that read Buy this book and Sleep tonight! I jumped online and ordered it and consumed it the minute I received it.  I have read many books in preparing for my first baby but none have the common sense and really practical advice for new parents than this book. The &quot;SLOW&quot; helped me a fix it on the minute person to take the time to see what my baby girl was wanting before I simply stuck my finger in her diaper then put a bottle in her mouth. I can now read her cues and cries and know what my little angel is telling me. It takes the guess work out and makes this mom very confident that her baby's needs are being met and she and I are much happier. I look forward to the toddler book coming out next year just in time for my princess and me.  I have bought this book for everyone I know who is expecting or having problems with understanding their baby.   It is a true gift!
B000002UA9|5.0|This is my favorite Beatles CD.  It has two of my favorite songs, &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;.  As the reviewer says, this is the real deal, raw and alive.  If you want to hear what the Beatles were all about in 1963 and why they changed music forever, buy this CD.
0440219078|4.0|I thought that &quot;the Giver&quot; was a very good book. It really makes you feel for the people who are involved in the story. I was kind of upset because of hoe the people lived. It was very disturbing and is kind of a wakeup call for the plunge that society today is taking. I hope that their society isn't like a foreshadow about what ours might become. The lead character was a very heroic boy who was only 12 years old and by how the society was, had to start his working life right away. I really did think that the giver was a really good book.
B000002UAU|5.0|It may have a lot of critics, but I love Sgt. Pepper. It's an album that I can put on and just sit back and sing along with and enjoy from start to finish. It's an album that requires more than one listen to fully grasp. You may listen to it once and come to the conclusion that it's a rather odd pop album, but upon further listening you will begin to absorb its deeper meaning. It's a very complex album with layers upon layers of sound, so the best way to experience Sgt. Pepper is with a good pair of headphones and no distractions. You can pay special attention to the many subtleties of the album that way. It may not jump out at you as the greatest album ever made on your first listen, but in time you will grow to understand it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|While most groups would be happy to hit no 1 just once, these guys pulled it off 27 TIMES IN 7 YEARS!!! My goodness, these guys were talented, and everyone on the planet NEEDS THIS CD!!!!
B000002UDB|5.0|I do not consider Magical Mystery Tour an official Beatles album, as it was just an EP soundtrack to the film, which the record company stuck several singles and B-sides on. However, it's still essential Beatles listening. I generally consider it to be a continuation of the Sgt. Pepper style. It was created in much the same way as Sgt. Pepper, and is arguably even more psychedelic. Magical Mystery Tour (the song) is rather similar to the title track of Sgt. Pepper and serves the same purpose, as introduction to the album. Other songs such as &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, and &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; continue the elaborate, complex production techniques that were begun on Sgt. Pepper. Thankfully, the Beatles were never ones to keep doing the same thing over and over, so for their next album, &quot;The Beatles (aka the White Album)&quot;, they abandoned this style and returned to straight-forward guitar rock. Their brief dabblings in psychedelia (Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour) are definitely wonderful listening though.
B000002UAR|5.0|This review is specifically targeted to those of you who talk about the 'hype' generated by VH1 placing this at the top of their stack. It is my understanding that when VH1 compiled their Greatest Albums of Rock n' Roll list, they were not looking for albums that have the maximum number of good songs on them. Instead they were looking for diversity, intelligent lyrics, great musical content and measuring (for lack of a better word) the influence that each album has (or had) on musical posterity -an album that would guide the direction that rock music would take. Revolver is just such an album. The beauty of the Beatles was not only the simplicity of their lyrics but the profundity of their meaning and the opulence of their music.<br />If one compares song by song, there are better albums (in my opinion) out there. Who's Next and Dark Side of the Moon are prospectives. Now to counter one review in particular, one of the reviewers wrote (loosely quoted): &quot;She Said and Taxman are good but are countered by bad songs like Yellow Submarine and Tomorrow Never Knows...&quot;. What can I say? Yellow Submraine - brilliant. Tomorrow Never Knows - seminal.<br />I guess such a statement really does make one wonder whether freedom of speech is a good thing.
1559408898|5.0|This movie is so good, it's about a cop that was murdered by a gang and takes revenge on them after getting turned into ROBOCOP. The Criterion Collection has the Director's Cut which shows a few more violent bits, as when Murhphy's arm gets shot off and a few more shots of him getting blown away and the director's cut shows two different camera shots in two scenes ,1)The scene where Murphy shoots bobby in the leg, the camera is zoomed in and 2)The scene where Clarence gets stabbed in the neck, the camera is zoomed in to his face for a few seconds. The most violent bit is probably the scene where Kenny gets blown away by ED-209 in the beginning. The Criterion Collection also has two trailers, the theatrical trailer has &quot;The Terminator&quot; theme in the background for some odd reason and Robocop 2's theatrical trailer has the original Robocop theme in the background(Robocop 2 trailer is not on Criterion Collection). The Criterion Collection has 3 storyboards, one is a film-storyboard of Kenny getting blown away and the other two are unshot sequences(one is a cemetary scene and other is chase scene). It also features an illustrated essay on making of Robocop and great Audio Commentary by some of the makers of Robocop including the director. I'll give Robocop the director's cut a NC-17 rating but I'm 15 and it probably wouldn't qualify for an X rating. This movie is the best Sci-Fi movie ever made. It has a good plot and a violent theme about revenge which makes this movie so good and makes it even better than &quot;The Terminator&quot;. The Criterion Collection of Robocop is a great DVD to buy if you're a Robocop fan or a Sci-Fi fan. 10 out of 10.
B000056VIY|5.0|Despite the horrible title, the CD is great!  I enjoyed On the 6, and was afraid that this second album would not be as good.  In many ways it is actually better!  It is very danceable (if you don't want to move when you hear &quot;Play&quot; then you are probably dead) and has a lot of great beats.  It's an impressive mix of Latin soul, R &amp; B, hip hop, and just plain pop.  I brought the CD to the gym, and it's perfect for working out.  Over the past few years, Jennifer has really developed her voice, both literally and figuratively, and it shows.  She seems a lot more confident and less tentative on this CD than the last.  And strangely enough, I feel that the tracks produced by Puffy are the weakest on the disk.  Go figure. Overall, fun music that is great for dancing!
B000002NJS|5.0|It seems almost sacrilegious to compare Madonna to The Beatles, but, then,  religious dogma has never been Madonna's strong suit.  Fact is, RAY OF LIGHT will probably ultimately be seen as Madonna's REVOLVER.  This is where she leaps from making music for others to mixing something for herself.  Her sound, here, takes on a spirit of genuine innovation, moving far away from the simple shockpop of her past.   Clearly she's on a mission to move trance into the light of the mainstream, almost in the same way George Harrison was eager to make the sitar standard equipment for garage bands.  The difference is that Madonna's experiments take place in her familiar dance laboratory, so that even if you don't quite get where she's going musically or lyrically, you can still groove to it from the first listen.   Take the album's perhaps unintentional nod to REVOLVER's South Asian chic, \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\".   Where Harrison and company most often used the sitar to bring fairly traditional Indian music on western ears, Madonna instead is making a musical masala.   She has no compunction whatever about throwing sitars in with a techno beat.   In the end, the brew she's concocting may not be palatable to cultural purists, but it's a potion which is more intoxicating than anything she's done to date.
B00000HZFH|5.0|Another great albumn from an incredible band. If you like rock music please give this record a chance.
0553106635|5.0|...this is hands down...the best book I've ever read! G RR Martin has firmly secured his place as my favorite fantasy author to date! I never thought he'd top Game of Thrones, let alone *this* dramatically. Even though it was 920 pages long, it wasn't nearly enough. I am in agony waiting for the next installment... Nothing I have read since has been able to ease the pain!<br />Who will survive the Storm of Swords? Don't bother trying to guess, because Martin's tale of too-many-kings NEVER leads where you expect it to, and his pen may kill even main characters at any moment. Time and time again he builds up the suspense until you want to scream. And just then... when he has you in the palm of his hand waiting to see what happens next- he does nothing short of blow you away!<br />Hurry up DANCE WITH DRAGONS!  For the love of God- PLEASE HURRY UP!
B000006045|5.0|Massive Attack is one of the most impressive groups since the Beatles. Its articulation between good taste and mathematical precision can not be rivaled. It is a delight to the senses, something to be listened in a calm place, among the mountains, surrounded by snow. Cool and gentle.

B000002U82|5.0|Lub dub. Lub dub. Hear that? Very quietly, the sound of a beating heart opens Pink Floyd's masterpiece, Dark Side Of The Moon. Like Floyd's other masterpiece, The Wall, the songs flow into one another making it difficult to tell when a song starts and stops. But unlike the Wall, which used 26 mostly short songs of filler to tell a story, Moon uses 9 lengthy, often instrumental songs. The album starts with the Speak/ Breathe medly, a pyshodelic, laid back song. Next comes On The Run, an instrumental tune with a fast, technoish beat and a whole lotta synth noises. Time, a song that clocks in at over seven minutes, is faster than the opening track, but sounds similar. Time opens with the sound of clocks and chimes and halfway through, switches to the Breathe Reprise, providing closure to the short, second half of the opening track. The Great Gig In The Sky is an instrumental with pianos, the usual Floyd psychodelic backing, and a choir singer scat-singing nonsense. After the albums only in between song pause (for when the record was flipped over) comes the sounds of cash registers and things. In comes a groovy bass line and soon Roger Waters is complaining about money, or something over a fast Floydian beat. Us and Them slows things down, but the tempo gradually builds up through Any Colour You Like (an instrumental) and peaks at the awesome closers, Brain Damage/Eclipse. The songs feature a similar jangly guitar, as well as assorted noises such as people laughing (&quot;The Lunatic is In My Head&quot; generates a good sampled chuckle) and assorted talking (&quot;You Know, there is no dark side of the moon; it's all just dark.&quot;) No record collection is complete without this album although it does take a few listens to get used to, especially the instrumentals. But after a few listens, you'll see why this album stayed on the Billboard charts for over 17 years (a record by far). Lub Dub. Lub Dub. After 40 minutes of genuis, the same heartbeat sound, scattered throughout the album, closes out the record.
B000056K04|5.0|Dave's latest release may be different from the other stuff he has produced, but certainly does not deserve some of the negative reviews he has received. Like all great artists, his latest work sees him exploring new areas whilst maintaining originality. It is by no means an album of simple melodies (check out the base line on if I had it all.) Yes it is different, but for any true DMB fan it is another masterpiece.
B000002U9W|5.0|I own virtually every Pink Floyd CD, and I can say that the title track on this piece is the single finest song on any of the CDs (yes, I put it a notch above &quot;Echoes&quot; for using more sound, and being more creative with it).  Effortlessly weaving between french horns, a full choir, hard-hitting guitar, and a motercycle, the track is even more exquisite with each additional listening. It's a great shame that the rest of the CD can't quite measure up to it.  &quot;If&quot; and &quot;Summer of '68&quot; are good, but not great.  &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; sounds contrived, and &quot;Alan's Psychidelic Breakfast&quot; is almost nauseating (the sounds of breakfast and microbioligy being discussed simultaneously nearly made me vomit, it's so realistic).  However, the title track is worth the sixteen bucks in itself.  Get this, turn on track one up to full volume, and be patient...it's sheer brilliance.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Very funny movie! I didn't laughed so much for a long time ;-) Of course I knew that director and scenario writer are ingenuous and limited people, but I couldn't even imagine on how much they are stupid... The Armageddon is just a regular sick American comedy, but nothing more... I rated it at 1 star only because it's very funny.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I had wondered for a long time about buying this album and it was only recently that i did.  When i went to the pub with some mates i would always put Otherside and Californication on the jukebox, and two weeks ago i decided to buy it and i feel that i have missed out on so too many months of listening to this album.  Calisofnication contains the hit singles Otherside, Californication, Scartissue, Around The World and Road Trippin.  This album that no Red Hot Chilli Peppers fan should be without, so if you dont own it then i recommend that you should go out and buy it

0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead is not Ender's Game. This is a fact which cannot be emphasized enough to people looking to buy it to get a mere 'sequel' to the first.<br />What it is, however, is another stunning example of Card's complexity through simplicity, and his incredible insight into human nature.<br />While Ender's Game dealt with the issue of how we treat those 'different' than us, on some level, it did not begin to touch upon it with the depth that Speaker for the Dead does.<br />Speaker for the Dead is a sociological study. In it, a third species (aside from humans, and the now eradicated buggers)  is discovered on a far off distant planet thousands of years after Ender wiped out the last threat to mankind.<br />The story centers around a group of anthropologists studying this alien race, since mankind is determined not to make the same mistake it did with the bug race.  Eventually, Ender is summoned to aid, though his true identity is not known.<br />We see the strange habits of the piggies grow stranger and stranger still, and see our own mores almost mocked in the reactions of the humans to these cultural behaviors.<br />All in all, it is a gripping story, a strong mystery (an element that was all but lacking from Ender's game), and another biting commentary (critique?) at human behavior and social beliefs.<br />It is not Ender's Game, no. It is as different as Ender's Game as hot is from cold. But it is a brilliant work of fiction, and an even more brilliant work of discussion.
0790743507|1.0|This must be the biggest conspiracy of all time. Sorry folks, but this is the biggest BORE-FEST I have ever seen. The plot is cheesy and uninteresting. The acting is old-school ham. The Wizard of OZ is the greatest musical, not this sleeping pill.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is perhaps the last great work of a Golden Age of Science Fiction. This is not to say that Sci-Fi as a genre is no longer worth reading, but nearly all authors of the genre now conceptualize of themselves as 'Science Fiction authors', and this was not always the case.<br />Dune is not, first and foremost, science fiction. It is commentary. It is some of the most biting and intelligent commentary on religion and government (as well as a plethora of other subjects, ranging from trade unions to ecology) ever written.<br />The fact that it is cloaked in a fantastical future should have no more bearing on our treatment of it than does, say, the fictions of 1984.<br />Dune is one of the greatest stories ever written. This is my firm belief, having read more books than I can care to count. The characters are deep and passionate. Entirely unlike anyone most of us have ever known, yet immenently believable all the same. They are the sort of people we are assured must exist; the sort of people we know mankind is capable of producing.<br />The villains are evil, the heroes are good. There is no ambiguity, but that is because the purpose of the book is not to shed light on the distinctions of good and evil within individual humans, but to investigate the power-plays among people on the grander level.<br />One thing I would caution against when reading this book: commit yourself to reading it. Many find the first half of the book quite slow. Some would even say tedious. Push through it, I beg you. For if you do not, you are cheating yourself of a great joy.<br />And when you finish Dune, continue to the rest of the books in the series. Part of the reason the first half can seem to drag is because Herbert was establishing a universe of incredible complexity. He was thinking in the long term, over a span of six or seven books.<br />And he succeeded in building that universe. The universe of Arrakis. Of Dune. And it will live on in people's minds for many years to come.
B000056K04|1.0|I have been a huge fan of the Dave Matthews Band since I first heard them perform in Charleston, SC in 1992.  I've seen them in concert in Charlotte, Nantucket, Chicago and New York several times in the last 10 years and needless to say, they ROCK! However, I am VERY disappointed with their new album, Everyday.  The band typically tours with a song for a year before recording it, and it was evident upon listening to the album for the first time that Dave threw together some unpassionate lyrics, added an electric guitar and recorded. There is honestly not one song on the album that is particulary melodious or memorable.<br />Will continue to support the band in its efforts and hope that their next album makes up for this one.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's game does credit to the modern genre of science fiction. Beset with various super-sciences on all sides, it can in no way be considered a 'non-sci-fi' piece of sci-fi, such as 1984.<br />But its characters and messages are so strong and vibrant that many who despise Science Fiction still find this book immenantly rewarding.<br />We follow the life of Ender Wiggin, a young child destined for great things. In this strange other-world where the battles of the future are fought like video games by mere children, Ender excells.<br />He is a military mastermind, a 'third' of a family of genius children. His potential for strategy, quick-thinking, and in the end, brutality, make him the perfect choice for a general of star-fleets of mass destruction.<br />The viewpoint in this book is what sets it apart, I think. So carefully crafted is Card's universe that we truly believe we are privy to the thoughts of a young boy--but a young boy faced with extraordinary circumstances beyond most of our imaginations.<br />I recommend this book as one of the great pieces of science fiction, and indeed, of writing in general.

B000001EHS|5.0|I am a new fan to Def Leppard so this was my first cd by them because I naturally by Best Of albums when I am new to a band and this album was just amazing. I liked every single song on the album. Def Leppard is a great band they have they're ballads and they're regular tracks and combined that makes this a great album. So if you are new to Def Leppard this is definetly worth getting as your first album. After listening to this I now know in the near future I will start buying all they're other albums. Some of the real good songs on here are &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot;, &quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot;, and &quot;Foolin&quot; but every single song on it is good. So this album is definetly worth getting weather you are new to Def Leppard or just a fan of them.

B00003CXMG|5.0|I had high hopes for this movie.  I didn't catch it in theatres, but I work in a video store and have been counting down for the past month until the day I could finally rent it.  After what seemed like a lifetime of waiting, I finally watched the movie.  I was blown away and despite the high hopes I had held my expectations were surpassed by a supreme margin.    The acting was perfect, flawless.  Each character was matched with an actor who captured the spirit to a 'T'.  Jason Lee is in his best role ever, despite it being a seemingly small part.  Billy Crudup is now in the running for my personal list of best actors.  And of course, it was great to see the lovely Fairuza Balk return in another simply dazzling film.    Even with the perfect cast a movie could still do badly, but Cameron Crowe added a beautiful script, and lastly, an extremely well done soundtrack that epitomizes the feeling of the movie.  It even includes &quot;Fever Dog&quot; by Stillwater.    The story was too great for words.  I hoped that it would not end. I was too caught up in the story, and I wanted to find out the rest of the epic.  What happened to Stillwater?  Where does William go from there?  And Penny?  But even with questions, I was left feeling like everything was perfect in the world, longing to have grown up in such a lovely time where bands had long hair and self indulgent guitar solos, and people actually yelled &quot;Does anybody remember laughter?&quot;
B00000J7SS|1.0|Most of the reviewers here regard this as a groundbreaking masterpiece, and it came highly recommended to me in the same vein by a friend.  But I don't see its appeal.  It's hard to go against the grain like this - you question yourself and whether you gave it a fair listen - but I've been listening to &quot;inaccessible&quot; music for decades now and I don't think it's my own failing that I don't appreciate this record.<br />If I had to boil my objections down to one sentence, it is this: Jazz-style improvisation does not mate well with rock influences.  Perhaps Bitches Brew is &quot;the birth of fusion,&quot; but rock is narcissistic enough as it is; merging it with jazz improv to invent &quot;fusion&quot; opens up not creativity but unbridled self-indulgence, which is all I hear in this tedious set of performances.  Listening to it all the way through is an endurance test, not an enjoyment.  <br />I'm not a jazz snob, and I'm not an anti-rock snob, either; the two genres together make up probably 2/3 of my collection.  But if this it what it sounds like when they merge, they're better off staying separate - in the same way that you might like steak and you might like chocolate, but not on the same plate.<br />-J.

B00004U8H4|3.0|I will begin by saying that I did not read the book.  In most cases when I see a movie that has been adapted from a book the movie leaves me feeling like I missed something. I usually run out, find the book and read it.  Although I am sure the book would paint an even deaper picture, it is not one I wish to imagine. Christian Bale did a marvelous job portrayng this character, with a bad actor, this movie would have had no chance. The fact that I watched it to the end is due to his acting more than the story itself.  He did pull you in and I knew if I did not watch the full movie I would probably end up renting it again.  I unfortunately did not find it humurous.  When chasing down the women in the hall and finally killing her I could only sit and wonder how someone could find this funny.  A few of the scenes dealing with co-workers which should have also been funny, I found just gave me the chills.  Like many of the reviewers you will diffinatly love it or leave with a sick feeling in your stomach(and not from laughing)  I would say it is for mature audiences only.  My nieces watch many movies that are rated pg-17 and above when they hit the video stand,  this should not be one of them.
B000002LRX|5.0|this album astounds me. fnm's best (though king 4 a day is a real close 2nd, and their only other really good album, imho)... in my top 3 of the 90's, without a doubt. i can hear so many of the big bands of today ripping the vibe of this album off, it's freaking pathetic. the formula for success in hard rock nowadays is thus: <br />1. rip off angel dust era fnm.<br />2. lose the keyboards.<br />3. get a dj (cuz that's an instrument!?).<br />4. lose the sense of humor (unless it's jokes about beating up women and others who are weaker than you)...<br />5. oh, and lose the intelligent lyrics, cuz they're lame, too.<br />too many bands bite fnm, simple as that. i'm looking at you, deftones, incubus, korn, limp bizkit, etc... those are the only ones i know the names of, but there are many more... this album (and this band) was WAAAAAAAY ahead of its time... like so many other artists (hendrix, zappa, beatles, zeppelin, pink floyd...), we're still catching up.
B00003CXE6|4.0|As much as I love the opening battle sequence of &quot;Gladiator,&quot; the jerky camera movements and strobe-like appearence made me dizzy to the point of almost falling out of my chair. Blood and guts are strewn across the screen like confetti on the first day of the millennium and right in the middle of it is one of the more compelling (and depressing) characters of the year 2000. Russell Crowe is one of the best things about the movie &quot;Gladiator,&quot; because with all of its spectacle and grand battle sequences, it lacks in the dramatic sense and its special effects are so video game-ish at times, I thought I was watching a medieval version of &quot;Final Fantasy VII.&quot; Some of the sequences involving the colosseum are so see-through and fuzzy that I was tempted to laugh, but the truth of the matter is, a movie like this isn't measured on the quality of its visual effects and dramatic highpoints (it actually does have a few). A film like &quot;Gladiator&quot; is graded on the superb nature of its art direction, cinematography, battle sequences, the courageousness of its hero, and the length of the venomous fangs of its villain. On those levels, it succeeds as well as any Roman epic ever made. Russell Crowe does make the perfect hero, and Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Commodus. The dramatic highpoints, which we always know are coming, but the payoff is worth the wait, are very well written. The battle sequences are plentiful, and when they don't look like they were shot with strobe-vision, they are extremely intense. The art direction is fabulous. We are actually stepping back in time with this film. It looks and feels real as we watch it, despite the bad special effects. And of course, a film like this, on such a grand scale, needs a director who has directed many influential films over the years. &quot;Gladiator&quot; has Ridley Scott, who has directed such films as the 1979 sci-fi horror epic &quot;Alien,&quot; which was only surpassed by James Cameron dynamically intense &quot;Aliens.&quot; He has also directed &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Thelma and Louise.&quot; There are more, but these are the true heavy hitters.<br />The basic plotline of &quot;Gladiator&quot; is Rocky on a series of downer narcotics. Russell Crowe is the leader of the Roman armies, General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is the &quot;father to a murdered son, husband to the murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance in this life or the next.&quot; (Those lines are delivered with such power that I slammed my fist down with a &quot;hell yeah&quot; in the theater) And it is true, Maximus was betrayed by the newly crowned Emperor Commodus, after Commodus killed the rightful leader of Rome, his own father, Marcus Aurelius, the last of the good emperors. Commodus is one sick puppy. He kills his father to make sure Maximus does not take the throne from him, which was the wish of the dying Aurelius, plans to take his sister as his queen (yuck), and instead of dealing with the plague proposes a series of games to keep the people of Rome occupied. (&quot;He'll give them death, and they'll love him for it.&quot;) Commodus has it all worked out, until the supposedly dead Maximus removes his helmet and announces his resurrection to the entire empire. Commodus thinks he can deal with this by arranging a series of unfair fights that he believes will end up with Maximus as the loser - meaning dead. But Maximus isn't so easily taken down. He can fight. OH MAN, CAN HE FIGHT! The plotline moves like a convential fight movie, with the scarred hero and the fiendish villain, and we know that by the end of the movie, Maximus and Commodus will fight. This much goes without saying, but &quot;Gladiator&quot; does have its fair share of surprises, and those pleasant events make the movie worth watching.<br />&quot;Gladiator&quot; doesn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar, that honor, I believe, belongs to &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; but it is truly heroic filmmaking of the highest calibur. I just would've liked to see something with better visuals and a better handled sense of drama. Not that I'm knocking &quot;Gladiator&quot; for its faults (I own the movie). Almost every movie has its faults; &quot;Gladiator&quot; just happens to wear its flaws proudly.ruly heroic filmmaking of the highest calibur.

B0000214F2|4.0|Some people had a problem with the flesh of the film. Dont pick it apart ...that is not how movies work. If I, for instance, had this on dvd and it skipped back and forth from one scene in the beginning, then to the Donner scene, to the end, then yes, we could listen to the critics. BUT THAT AIN'T HOW IT WORKS- as we say in Alabama. Frankly from front to finish you will enjoy this movie, if you will just believe it. It happened. You will laugh you will cry, and may even be inspired.
B00003CXRO|4.0|CAST AWAY was a pretty good film, except that it seemed to take forever. The acting is excellent, of course - especially when you've got the talent-likes of Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt in the same movie. Although I don't agree with most of the people's reviews - I thought Tom Hanks played his role very well and seemed very realistic. Sure, he's famous - but aren't a lot of actors are? And Helen Hunt was great, too. But from the time Tom Hanks was left on the island really did seem to take forever. And who knows? This film does have a point and could be pretty useful...somebody could get stranded on an island all alone out in the middle of the ocean any day, and wouldn't it be helpful to know how to survive it by seeing this film? Anyway, CAST AWAY is a great film with excellent acting and some of the best special effects of the year. Still, my absolute favorite film and the film I think is the best movie of the year is ALMOST FAMOUS. Two totally different films but you'd like both and you should see both CAST AWAY and ALMOST FAMOUS. I totally recommend both films!
