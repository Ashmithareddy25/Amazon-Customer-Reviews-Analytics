B0057OV5MG|5|Excellent fit was perfect, I saved over $275 by purchasing this and install myself.
B00AV2ENFU|1|Very disappointed in this purchase. Caps leak to the extent that the can is unusable.  The cap jumps threads and cannot be tightened. Further the O rings I the caps expanded upon contact with fuel and tended to bulge out of their seats.
B00V337VNM|5|Cute and sporty! Spruced up my little old car.  Easy to install and look great. Delivered very quickly.
B007V2EKRE|3|Work ok but a little small not that of a custom fit.
B00BG6SBXU|5|Worked great on my 13' Chevy Silverado 2500... clears the firewall with at least 1/2&#34; of space... if you are having an issue with your existing dp hitting your firewall, this pipe is the answer.
B0083G3AXC|5|Love these!!
B004GCAR10|1|Did not fit my ses bumper
B00CMEWFAK|5|Reasonable price, does what it is supposed to do.
B007B856YY|5|Cheap switches, but what do you expect for the price.  They are great for little projects.  I used some for interior LED truck lights as well as one in the back for cargo lights.  THEY ARE CHEAP, but they work.  They don't feel very sturdy and the function is not real crisp, but they work.  I have ordered these before for another project so I knew what I was getting.  Out of the last batch one did not work.  This time, all of them worked.  Even then, I am still happy with them for the price.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  If you want a great quality, heavy duty, long lasting switch, go spend $8+ dollars on ONE switch.  If you are looking to score several lower quality switches at a bargain price, buy these.
B00UZLWM78|5|Perfect fit...I had a set of Grand Cherokee wheels powder coated and needed these to replace the original chrome ones.  They went on in just a few seconds (each).
B007S0LDME|5|This product really lives up to its promise.  We had been using the usual chemical black water tank treatment in our motorhome.  It was not totally effective plus it left a slight odor of the cover-up chemical.  Happy Camper has no odor at all and it absolutely eliminates residual odors from the black tank and the grey water tank.  We will definitely reorder.
B006C27RS8|1|dose not work complete crap don't buy
B001EAQTRI|5|Yep.  Cleaned up the audio chain just fine.  Exactly what I needed, and it did exactly what it was supposed to.
B007L6GHH6|5|Got the item it was exactly what it was suppose to be . Received it a day earlier than was suppose too even Better Thanks
B0022ZSIP0|5|Direct swap for my OEM 15T front sprocket.  Went on easy and rode 100 miles on it the next day without issues.
B0034ZNY10|1|What little time it worked, it was great.  Before I got my  car cleaned out of just afew particles and mostly sand and grit from my shoes, the motor burned up and Amazon credited my account for it.  Will buy a better model next time.  It did have good reviews though.
B000AS1XYO|5|Excellent product, great for all engines!
B006ZAJKM8|5|Exactly what I needed, saved the day.  R-12 to R134a, custom job.
B003SZ3JC0|5|Worked great C.E. light is out.
B00EPDLS3Q|5|Very good product
B001HZGY9S|2|worked fine
B00CFO86QE|5|Worked perfect on my 18' toy hauler. Got all 4 done with all new hardware.
B001PPHOU8|2|So far none if the Mishimoto products I've purchased have fit OEM like suggested.
B00A2VHM1W|5|Works perfectly
B009M0S4Z2|4|Works well, helps to protect car seats...
B000GKIE4S|5|No Complaints!
B00340CV0U|3|I had to file the bolt slots to get closer to the center push bolt to make this work for my 1996 Buick.
B007KPWFOW|1|I need your help getting these returned!!!
B005YP5HHM|5|Works just like original.
B00J62W0L0|5|Love them. Mechanic who installed them was impressed with quality.
B0007N201M|1|Disappointed.  I actually bought this tool at Auto Zone. the 13/16 size.  It got one lugnut off and as other reviews say it was difficult getting the lugnut back out of the tool, lucky I have a grinder to grind flats on the lugnut to clamp in vice. tried it on another lugnut and it just stripped it's threads, finally unscrewed it off that luck not and tried it on another with the same result.  Looking at the tool after that, I could see that the threads inside were &#34;flattened, so this tells me that it is not hardened properly or a different steel needs to be used. or deeper cutting threads, who knows?  Also the tool does seem too &#34;deep&#34;, ideally you want the tool to bottom out after threading itself on, so that it can then have to start putting pressure on the nut itself to unthread it.  I paid $10.00 at auto Zone. 11 something after tax.  Just another disappointing tool that is not made with enough quality from Taiwan.  Nothing against Taiwan, just the people that design or approve this stuff to save money instead of making a customer happy so that he would use your company again. ATTENTION CTA Manufacturing Corporation, Carlstadt, NJ if I see your label on it, it will remind me not to buy it instead of the other way around. Sad......................... I guess that's it.
B007VRAFS2|4|Product arrived on time and good quality
B00377535U|1|Terrible terrible terrible. Might as well of given the money away. Sent with the wrong nozzle size, very cheaply made, it's simply garbage
B007XZK61S|5|Excelente
B00GH46TBM|5|Awesome looks great
B001DUEWJ6|5|Slow speed clunking noise is gone!
B00P2VXM8E|5|Brackets were not aligned properly and they just piped last week , I installed them anyway knowing they will pop , not your fault but your source probably, just give you heads up 👍🏻
B000PDICCU|1|This will not fit in a 1993 plmouth acclaim
B0052YK270|4|Great product, but you really need a very short 6mm Allen wrench to install these. Should come in the package, even if it costs a bit more. Had to ruin one of mine to install. Otherwise, they are great.
B005GHPG4W|5|From the night that I ordered them online to delivery at my house it only took 2 1/2 day is! They make my car look brand-new. I haven't been this happy with any car purchase except for when I bought my actual car! I highly suggest going with this company-the parts are authentic with the grips underneath the mat's to keep it secure as well as the spot for the hooks on the driver side. They are the right color, they have the RAV4 stitching on them, and they are fitted perfectly for my 2010 RAV4. This is my new favorite company!
B003HU0YFQ|5|works good no issues to talk about
B002WTJ9K4|5|perfit fit
B00CTRAG7Y|5|Perfectly made. Chrome looks awesome. The welds are flawless.
B0002RNSLO|5|I was buying some other trailer connectors and decided to buy this to have &#34;just in case.&#34;  Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but seems to be built very well.
B0002VC5HI|3|Worked well, but the savage beasts it's meant to protect from the sun think it's a toy, and tore it down so often that eventually it wouldn't stay up.
B003E3PYOW|5|good deal
B006OUNFIO|5|good price
B008HZPCQW|2|Missing pins for holding brake pads
B004HP3BJQ|1|Says it fits model vehicle. It did not. K&N is a good brand overall.
B000C5DKLY|5|good
B003BZD03K|5|Easy to use. Takes the bend out of your hose where it goes into your RV. Don't know why I waited so long to purchase.
B009NOZ4RI|5|Working as expected, fits in original bulb space.
B00APTSCC4|5|Quality and fast shipping.
B002935IV2|5|Worked great!
B009S2ZQNM|5|Better than the original and at a fantastic price.
B007WQQEMS|5|good item
B000GOG3P6|3|You get what you pay for - it works, moves air, but is very noisy. And it's that tinny noise. Who knows how long it might last. I don't drive this vehicle that much, so it's a good solution to keep the cool or hot air coming when needed.
B003TM6ROE|5|very happy with quality
B000C5I7Y4|5|Perfect fit dropped operating temperature by 30 degrees great for the 100 plus temps I drive in daily.
B00VV2JMEG|4|Good product but no wiring diagram/instructions.
B004VKZ910|5|Perfect....easy to install, works great.
B001UG4WIO|4|Good read
B00J62VV4W|5|Works great. Little bit of a pain to install but it's as advertised!
B00C307YEK|2|These are strictly for show!! Not comfortable at all!! Also, the end caps are not secure at all....a couple of rides with these on and the end cap on one of them came off....you get what you pay for.
B007IT758Q|5|I ordered this and it arrived 4 days early! It looks amazing and I love it! U guys rock!
B004SODALA|3|Honestly, it's not that great. It does not fit all that well and leaves a big gap in one place and overhangs on another. It looks better from outside the car since I can't see the bad spot in the dash anymore so I'm keeping it. Overall, it's mediocre.
B002V1I97C|1|No, this product does not meet anybody's expectations because it is not made for the time zone of North America and the main feature that synchronize the clock with the satellite, may work possibly in China and Japan but not in America and therefore, it gives the wrong time with delays of more than an hour in just a few days, this Clock Napolex fizz-860 car sedan RV truck SUV.. is worthless.
B00AF5332C|5|Worked fine this far.
B002BHX1X8|5|Really convenient.  Those who had their ECM fuses blow when using this probably had the disconnect positive battery cabe touch ground or any metal surface.  It's best to tape the ends of the battery cables when using this product to prevent shorting! I'm a retired ASE certified mechanic.
B00NJRGD70|5|Light, easy to use, works great. We're spending a couple of weeks in a location where the parked cars face the sun for 8 hours a day. Tried them for the first time today and the difference was dramatic. Only wish I'd gotten them sooner.
B0014HP8LO|5|It fits like is should, and was quick to ship.
B000C2WKY0|5|fits like glove
B004UPZXI0|5|Simply...  I absolutely love it!!  Please, do yourself a favor and buy it!
B004UHTSTI|5|looks really good
B003G39SDI|4|perfect fit
B00AZPI0NE|5|Very bright and well built
B00U0A8N68|5|BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LOL
B002XLHUQG|5|work great
B000FDU386|3|It fits perfectly.  Like a glove.  They obviously did their homework on measurements for my car.  It's easy to manage and take on and off.<br />The only complaint I have is this:  I used to use a $40 car cover from a parts store for the same model, and it didn't &#34;breathe&#34; enough during wet weather, so I'd take the cover off after a week or two and find a considerable amount of surface mold on the carpets and hard parts of the interior.  I thought maybe if I spent a little more on this one, that problem might be solved.  Alas, after having the cover on for about 10 days of Pacific Northwest rain, I took the cover off and found white mold on my carpets.  Not a huge amount, but enough to spend an afternoon dealing with.<br />I don't know if there's a way around this if you live in a wet climate, but if you're like me and mold is a specific problem you're looking to fix, this might not be the cover for you.
B000N21PLI|3|You may have seen a lot of Milodon parts while out at the race track and think, that must be some good performance stuff. I purchased this pump because I knew it to be a high volume, counterclockwise, for vehicles with serpentine belt. But now that I know, I could have purchased another and saved a few dollars. This pump has on its casting &#34;GMB&#34; leading me to believe it is a GMB brand pump in a Milodon box. With this information, I found here on Amazon a GMB performance pump for less money. (Look for a P at the end of the part number.  All that makes this a High Volume pump is the addition of an anti-cavitation plate on the impeller. Used to be able to buy these plates (I know from Milodon), but spending a few dollars more for a pump with it is worth it.  I deducted two stars for the deception, over priced and the cheap gasket on the impeller cover oozing out making me worry it would leak. I am replacing all gaskets with Fel-pro gaskets.
B000C2QN8Y|5|Great value
B002PB1L50|3|The power cord was about 6 inches too short. I had to splice in extra wiring in order for it to fit properly. Otherwise physically it fits and functions fine.
B005OK2L94|5|Much bigger and much louder than I expected... Of course testing them inside a garage was a bad idea but we did it anyways. Had to do short bursts because it was just too loud to do without ear plugs. It actually hurt because it was so loud. The table is was on was shaking because the noise is just insanely loud. I didn't really think they were going to be real train horns but I guess you get what you pay for (which is going to be the bill for hearing aides when you get older hahaha).<br /><br />I didn't expect them to be as big as they are... I actually had no space to put them up the front of my truck and I think they're too big for the roof so they will be put onto the frame on the drivers side.<br /><br />If you're looking for train horns, don't go with the stupid and cheap little ones. I almost did and I would've regretted that. These ones from Grand General are amazing and I definitely don't regret buying them. I'm hoping I don't literally scare the life out of someone but I guess that's the price they're going to pay when they cut me off anymore.<br /><br />If I were on Monsters Inc. trying to fill those scare tanks, I'd be at the top of the leaderboards with this amazing setup. You can't go wrong with Grand General train horns. They're high quality and sound great!!!
B000C57Z42|4|Fit my 2003 Ford Ranger 4WD. So far so good.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|This sunshade is just as advertised. Fits the windshield well and seems to be made of quality durable materials.
B001T9CG94|4|First, you’ll probably only get one hole with this unlike the Rain-X 600001 (which I just purchased to finish do my other bulls eye and will let you fill more than one ding). I found this to be a bit messy, hard to align right over the ding and though it didn’t mask the ding much it did prevent it from getting a running crack. Perhaps some user error was involved but the rain-X is a much better system… in my opinion.
B007K8AA7I|4|These lights are great! FAR better than any traditional headlight out there!<br />I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to warranty one of the four I own for being dim when directly compared to the others. Even that one was brighter than a normal halogen headlight!
B00T0TYXGY|4|Good quality decal. It was bit smaller than I had imagined. My intention was to put it center on the rear window of Jeep. I ended putting it on the little tiny window on the side.
B00AYIY9DM|5|Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ.
B0071N6VZW|5|Excellent cover and fitment. Easy to install in minutes. Like the C5 emblem.
B00P2SYBJG|4|Put these in my 1997 Expedition and it runs like a dream.
B00VE1C3OK|1|Horrible product. Leather piece fell off after a month.
B00CUEBT86|5|It was received on time and it was a perfect fit.
B00MWFFFQK|5|I'm fully satisfied with this seller. A+
B00HFE4K7I|5|Quality decal, delivered when promised.  Easy to apply.
B000BLMJNY|3|The light works great but it took quite a while before it got to my door. Kind of inconvenient since I ordered it as a much-needed replacement.
B00C0SQPOA|3|Seem a little cheesy but they work.
B00GUDCVN0|5|Purchased for my 2007 Yukon Denali, trunk wouldn't unlock or lift manually.  I was close to buying the liftgate motor until I read several reviews, this Liftgate latch solved solved the problem, Easy installation, I would replace the liftgate before replacing the motor.
B000JK2D06|5|This stuff is as good as everyone says it is. Goes on/off easy, makes a great finish, lasts a long time.
B00QLF49AK|5|Wow. Extremely satisfied with these. Heavy duty nice big heat sinks and durable glass fronts. At night I can't even describe these. They are more flood then beamy so be aware of that. Highly reccomend. It feels like a light worth 5x what its worth.
B00877SL2M|1|I know people would buy because they give you so many lights .but you will need ever last one because they don't last .every month a new led went out .
B00NQ45A6G|3|Little small for my truck but would fit a car much better.😕
B0002SQYTG|4|Works likes it is supposed to. Good price. Fast delivery.
B0031794W4|5|Satisfying about items & shipping
B0019O1BS6|5|it's a filter, easy to install.
B0002M8QP2|4|Works as expected. Wish that it had a better lock
B00MN963JS|4|At first I thought this Mask was more the quality of a cheap Halloween costume, but once I put it on, I instantly saw the benefits of wearing this while riding my bike or shoveling snow. It looks really cool on too! I sent photos to my friends they loved it! I wish that the &#34;jaw portion&#34; sat more on my actual jaw, but when I looked at the multiple uses for the mask I was pretty impressed with the options I had to wear it in multiple ways. I can see myself getting a lot of use out of this, not to mention it speaks to that inner metal-head teenager that I'll always be.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this mask, but expect a &#34;Halloween Costume&#34; type of material, that will keep you surprisingly warm. I haven't worn it outside yet, but expecting I'm going to get some looks and I'm kind of excited about that. who doesn't want to see a skeleton doing yard work!?<br /><br />I received this item as a review deal and I'm happy to give it a solid &#34;thumbs up&#34;.
B000N5SHLQ|4|Great product, assembeled with ease, no problems
B007DCDJYC|5|So cute!  If you love Totoro you won't be disappointed!
B0096BARCA|5|Fit exactly the same as the Honda OEM radiator I removed.  Comparing side by side, all of the connections and mounts matched, tube angles.  I appreciated the factory included and installed captive nuts for the fans, making installation even easier.  Other than the molded Honda badging on the top and after removing the product sticker, no one would ever guess it wasn't a Honda product.  Filled with Honda coolant and had no leaks with original hoses and clamps.  Excellent value and would recommend for your similar model Honda.
B00N18LXJ0|5|Good product for an economical price.
B00HRSTNGU|5|The tool made it very easier to pop out the light covers.
B006EGAIII|5|Work well, very light and handy.
B00TQQU6US|5|Perfect length for motorcycle powered sand rails. No more cutting a chain and wasting 30 links. I am really impressed by the quality of the DID chains. I've been using RK chains in the past, and they stretch throughout their life, but I've never had one fail. I was given a ZVM-2 chain, and used that for the past 2 years, and am using the ZVM-X now. The ZVM-2 and ZVM-X chains have held up great so far, and only stretch initially. They also include a small grease packet for lubricating the master link, instead of having it come pre-greased like other chains. I can see why DID is the OEM supplier for many motorcycle manufacturers.
B004INC4WM|4|If you have a manual the clutch line bracket is not attached to the LEFT side trans mount you will have to cut it off the old one and weld it on other than that soft and resolved engine clunck with the bottom mount only.
B000KYWWJS|3|I couldn't get it to work. But I wasn't expecting anything, too. At least the ring was made of metal instead of composite like the original. Shipping was quick enough; no issues there.
B00W5MG8XY|5|good quality
B00GUEVW3E|1|They are bright but, I can not see the road. They shine the road signs but that's about it.
B00W4IDIGE|5|High quality material and workmanship.
B00M5DI1A6|5|absolutely delighted...the price was perfect..i had a friend install it ....couldn't have been more happy then I was,thanks
B000JZCZAY|5|Thanks just what I need ed
B001NZ4G8S|5|Perfect and saved me TONS of money by doing it myself
B003S0B9EA|5|Easy to install and use; inexpensive; convenient.
B0040D2QC8|3|Clips were good, however, their long length requires spacers to clip in for a tight fit.  Those spacers should have been included with this product.
B00IALJ6PG|5|Worked perfectly for my 03 Odyssey. If you find it is not lined up properly you just rotate the body to line up to the hub mounts.
B00UUSV1P0|5|Everyone should own one of these. Not only can you break a window in case of an emergency, you can also cut seatbelts off in an emergency.
B00IS94K6K|5|Worked perfect...
B00LOR6O9O|3|Gets the job done. I was skeptacal about this purchase, but when I recieved them, it had most the screws I needed. 02 CBR F4i
B008N8ILQG|5|Like
B00755JMYS|5|Very good lsmps, fit in old lamp socket
B009KW82CC|5|My hubby loves this key chain. You can even blow on it and the little turbo spins
B000CIT3N0|5|PERFECT FOR THE TOYOTA 1MZ-FE!
B00DSW28I4|1|I contacted the company that shipped the first set of lights that didn't work so they shipped me a second set and those didn't work either
B004HCOE8Q|5|Removed some nasty scratches from my glossy black door. Didn't leave any marks indicating it's too abrasive. Tempted me to remove all the other scratches, which would be a lot of work, so maybe I should remove a star for being too good?
B00J4TW6ZA|4|Delivered in good shape and on time.  Shipping crate was sturdy and protected the product well.  Predelivery service was excellent.  You need to send for the documentation once you get the unit to confirm the vin number.  They also provide you tube links for inspection and assembly instructions.  You need to view ALL of these videos.<br /><br />Assembly was straight forward and relatively easy provided you have watched the videos.  I used a motorcycle jack to raise it up while working on it for ease.  Not everything matches the instructions.  This was a newly revised unit and had a gel battery so there was no need to add acid and the body panels were slightly different from the videos, but again, straight forward.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had was starting it.  My Fault.  I forgot that I had seen early on in one of the videos you need to pull both brake levers before the starter will engage.  Duh!<br /><br />After about a month's use (I personnally do not ride it) the steering needs to be tightened up a bit.  Probably not a big deal but if it is I will repsond here.
B0000AY69V|5|Works great, and it was much bigger than I expected.  Amazon shipped fast as always and I enjoy the spotless shine on my car now.  Would advise that this needs to be stored slightly wet and always re wet and ring it before each use.  Great product!
B000BWCFT6|5|Its tape it works
B00ARXQQOY|3|Did the job I got it to do a valve job on a 350 worriorthe framming seams a lil weak and the cups wasn't big enough to go over the valve spring
B004HCS4NW|5|Execellent
B007GREY4S|5|As described
B009DJXR1I|5|This tailgate came without any dents, which half surprised me. It fit great and works perfectly.
B00PTQOF4W|1|This is a complete joke of a wiring kit. Wired it to my truck with a 42 inch led light bar, started driving down the road, turned on the light bar and the wires started smoking! I drove back to my house as fast as I could and stripped all of the melted wire out of my truck. In the process burning my hand and the inside of my headliner, with smoke filling my entire cab!! I highly recommend a professional install before you look at this wiring harness. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star rating but am forced to.
B003YCEMUA|5|Very good quality.
B00K1HPNO0|4|This is a nice and clean. If you need to hold a cell phone,  get an inexpensive selfie stick; remove the top fits perfectly-- works great!
B00P6I150A|3|Great for the money
B00U5UAMWQ|5|Works perfect
B008G28WKY|4|Had a lil dent on where the rubber wheel goes but other then that perfect
B001CF1A7O|5|Well made, tough, easy to use and just awesome!
B001C6NL52|5|Sure make a tool box look organized and functional
B00BWOW79U|4|It was difficult to install.  I had to grind down the parts I had to insert into the frame so that they would fit.
B00P05B1DA|5|The mats are great and fit perfectly. Also, buying them through Amazon saved us $100 versus buying the mats at a &#34;discounted rate&#34; from the Toyota dealership. Thanks again for the competitive pricing.
B004A6LAD6|5|This is perfect!! I saved over 700 eur by repairing my ac-line with this!!
B001LNKH6W|4|The fenders were exactly as advertised. Worked great.<br />THX David
B003UVCY00|2|Bought two for my older kids one was broken within the first use because of water leaking in and wouldn't stop making noise and flashing it was awful. All night it was making high pitched sounds.
B00MNQUWXY|5|they fit nice and snug
B000AMW0J2|5|Great price
B00OPMIR2M|5|Exactly what I ordered.  I'm happy with the product.  It does it's job.
B004A61MAC|5|Tad more oil pressure from less restrictive synthetic filter media, well made, will buy again. Also a bigger filter that fits my 07 silverado
B00DSVMCUE|4|I love this vest - had some biker patches sewed on looks great lots of compliments
B00HS5RQKC|5|Great product and service!
B0051D3MP6|5|Arrived on time and and performs as described.  Very happy with the accessories for charging as the accessories give greater utility to the product.
B005334JYW|1|order for someone else......

B000NCXM1O|5|Perfect fit! 2015 tundra TRD double cab. Easy install.
B00F7HD6VQ|5|So true to my personality and so many love it.
B00B0C13B2|5|After installing I can only say that my car drives like a brand new car it's five years old first time it's drove like that since I've owned it!!
B001N2O3PM|5|Excellent, just as pictured and just as described, nice and heavy and nice and shiny
B000MIUJNI|5|I use this tool with harbor freight tire mounting tool.  The HF tire bar is thick and has crude shapped ends.  The Ken - tool works much better and gets under the rim easily.  Also , it does not mark up the rims as you mount or dismount the tires.  I used this tool on tractor and well as ATV tires and it works well.  Made in USA.
B00N5PLPD8|4|Good!
B006K6P68O|4|Fits my 2015 Honda CR-V perfectly.  This part number is the same as the part number in the Honda accessories catalog for the 2015s, so if you have one, you may order with confidence!
B00A74HHT6|5|These work great connected them to my 1000 watt wind turbines. I will probably never come close to exceeding the capacity of this rectifier.<br />Plus with this no reversing diode is needed between this and the controller. Prompt Delivery
B009ZH4OD8|4|it fits
B00N58M6CO|5|Perfect made 👍🏼
B0002YU2YS|5|Had one heating element fail completely and the other was on it's last leg on our Bradford White 65 gallon water heater. Bought two of these and the special wrench to install them. Flipped the breaker, drained the water heater (it takes a lot longer than you think), unhooked the wires, pulled the old ones, put in these (no fitment issues), refilled water heater, flipped breaker and viola, more hot water than we can use. My wife is back to luxurious baths, the dishwasher is cleaning like it should, and we have constant 120 degree hot water for whatever.
B00HA1NKTK|5|This the best reflector I have ever purchased. It's a perfect fit. Received it in a timely manner as well
B00170MW8K|5|Good quality and no more squealing :D
B00GMNL8LO|5|It fits perfectly on my Toyota Camry, and it looks amazing.
B009F590L6|5|great quality at a v good price, easy install, with more than enough bolts etc.
B00NRV9O5G|1|Did not work
B000ES9E96|5|They work well for my dash lighting but the old dash I used them in does not spread them out as well as it did the old bulbs
B00QFY2BCK|5|Like most reviewers here, I was skeptical.  Sounds too easy and inexpensive to be true...but for less than $5, figured I had nothing to lose.  Received the small package in less than a week, used it according to instructions a few days later and like most of the reviewers, surprised and thrilled that it really works!! Just wipe with the cleaning towel, wait til it dries, and finish with the finishing towel. Headlights are much cleaner and clearer. Now I'm just waiting to see if the headlights will stay clear and whether the wipes will still work after a few months, or will they dry out?
B006FUT09G|5|Remarkably this really does seem to be an improvement over the many glass cleaners on the market.  Smells good also.
B001P2BK24|1|Advertised 2 shocks come in box only 1 In box NOT 2 beware !!!!! These are available elsewhere
B0082365AQ|5|I had priced kayak carts at up to $100. I thought this one would be cheaply made at the price I paid for it. Its exactly like the others that I looked at and it does the job! Easy to assemble, folds for easy storage. So glad I ordered it!
B000CNB4U0|5|The taxi rides smoother now than it did when I bought it new. I have put 31000 km on it since I installed them and they are just as good as new. I love the fact you can grease them. They are better than oem parts. I will be installing them on the entire fleet
B00DFPAZY8|5|Decals fit nicely on my '87 Jeep Wrangler. I was completely satisfied.
B0012INNEE|5|I noticed better acceleration, higher top speed and all around more pep when I cut out the permanent secondary air filter that's built in to the top of the air box and installed this puppy. 2006 Tacoma base model work truck
B000E65J9M|5|Just like factory would buy again fast shipping
B00BXMRP4I|5|shipped fast and works great. just be sure to purchase the r134 adapter with it or else you wont be able to use it on most vehicles
B00A4ABF8W|5|I already had a powerful cordless drill so I bought this and everything worked and looked great. It takes a little longer cause it's a small pad but it's worth it and it couldn't be easier to use
B001AD6T24|4|Bag was great but a bit too big for my Harley V-Rod. The one negative thing I have about this product is that the strap that goes over the back rest is too high...it should be more centered and I probably would have kept the bag for road trips.
B00480BVQA|5|my cover came off on the road somewhere. This replacement has all the hardware and fits fine.
B003ZGKKD8|5|Always excited to get these. Durable as well as motivating! Thank you for the quick shipping.
B000IYR6O6|5|Very sturdy contruction, high quallity taiwanese product, well packed, powerfull but it is louder than the original Kia fan but it makes the job flawlessly, in a V6 Kia optima installation is not so easy than in the L4 engine version, because there is not enough room, about the seller I recommend this seller.
B00QLDH9YA|5|Best thing I ever purchased for my car, after brakes.
B00EZBSEAS|5|Don't waste your money buying replacement tail lights from your local Mazda dealer or specialty parts supplier.  These lights are the EXACT same units you will receive if you order from the dealer--right down to the blue Mazda stickers on the box.  The lights themselves are stamped with the Koito name, the OEM supplier to Mazda.  They even include the updated thicker gasket to prevent the common moisture issue that plagued the originals.  At approximately $85 each they are a great buy versus the $150+ dealers charge.
B00EEG79B4|4|Installation was easily performed;  you do have to loosen mirrows to get tab under them. They are mounted with two way tape, 3-M tape is used it is a good quality, but buyers need to know, the means of mounting these on. Time and weather will tell if tape will hold. Fit was satisfactory. Almost 2 yrs later, tape holding fine.  Shades are subject to scratches pretty easily.
B000CQDM5W|5|Excellent product and fast shipping fits very good
B000AOMQ80|3|I thought this was for bicycle tires.  It is not.  But I used it for that purpose anyway and it works fine.
B0082GL0MQ|5|fits Hyundai perfect
B001KQ5LCU|3|I truely appreciate Amazon for sending me this replacement without charge for a previous product purchase which ultimately had the wrong color information in the product description (just said &#34;paintable&#34; and the color in the pictures was not very distinguishable.) This specific product I'm writing this review on was indeed the correct color but had some undesirable revelations. The door handle itself (what you grab on to to open the door from the inside) sits almost flush with the handle trim bezel. While this is esthetically better than the original, is does not conform to what OEM handles are suppose to look like. Last, this product is not designed to work as a proper OEM replacement. When attached to the latch and door lock linkages and fully slid back into the proper installation position, the door latch did not release when the interior door handle was pulled. I was able to compensate for the out of spec design by drilling a hole and inserting a screw at the bottom 30ish degree corner of the handle perimeter, so that the handle sits about 1/2 way horizontally between insertion and the proper installation position. The price of this time is very good, but buyer beware that some customization will be involved to make this product function correctly.
B00BCRMA9Y|5|I absolutely love my new set covers.. They fit my Nissan Juke like a glove and look like they were custom fitting. The quality of the fabric is awesome. The installation was a breeze and I love the extra accessories. For the same price as what most places charge for the front two seats you get the seat felt attachments, back bench seat and steering wheel cover. Highly recommend this set!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B001QVET2W|5|Worked great, no more noises from under the hood now.
B00C5RCIY2|5|Thanks
B00I5X05SG|5|easy to replace. works so well that i thought it was stuck and wouldn't go back down the after initial installation! one of those &#34;i've forgotten how the hood should go up and close securely&#34;. the vender is super fast with shipping as well as great value for the product
B0031WCJ3A|5|the look is just gorgeous...<br />I love the pouch in which you can store sides and rear
B00BXLTIXA|5|I was very pleased when I and with the service provided by the seller. The one I ordered although it said it was delivered, never arrived at my home. Once the seller was made aware of what happened replaced it right away. The items quality is high end like the Cadillac Escalade. I couldn't imagine a more perfect key Chain Fob to Enhance such a Valuable set of keys.  It so more than worth the price.
B00CMP3Z4E|5|I got it at a great price on a lightning deal. And it was a fresh one rather than old or nearly expired battery jumper. From the looks of their website, I got the impression that Clore has good customer care. I especially like the recharge reminder via email from the Clore company. If you're lucky enough to come across the lightning deal, don't hesitate to get it. The jumper itself is compact & stows away neatly.
B00W73KCDI|1|Product received had metal fuel line tips (warned against in the product description) instead of the latest OEM design plastic fuel line tips.  metal corrodes quickly with 10% ethanol gasoline is used
B00DILUBL6|5|Good ATF oil what else can i say other then fast shipping !
B0030ICO3U|5|I have a one car garage and space is very tight. Every time I park the car it is in the same spot every time. Very easy to setup it took me less then 5 minutes and it runs on batteries so I don't worry about trying to plug it in a outlet. Now I have room to walk around the car without opening the garage door.
B001G6JIFK|5|Just replaced my OEM E39 M5 arms with these, no complaints A+ quality stuff.
B00CPGQ2DG|5|Handy device.  Keep in in my tank bag.
B00ANO7JSE|5|Holy moly!  Took away a considerable amount of the drive train slop in my 14 WRX.  Easy install with a jack and hand tools.  A must for anyone looking to get a lot more for a little coin!  Slight increase in NVH, but nothing close to a deal breaker! Well worth it.
B00KWKEE3C|1|Does not work
B00B7C2TB8|5|Works just like original!
B00D42AFS8|5|Not much to really explain other then the fact that it is a great item that you must have in your car. Wont go any where with out this thing.
B00KWWNG16|5|As expected would buy again!
B00BUS1BMM|1|I just bought this at the dealer for my 2015 Forrester. I told them what I wanted to use it for. My dog is a lab/Shepherd mix about 80 pounds and he gets through the sides no problem. I am very disappointed and have communicated to the dealer . Mine is not this exact model but the same product they offer. What a waste of money
B00INCWJI8|5|My first can of Kroil oil was passed down to me by my father, a machinist by trade. He swore by the stuff. When that rusty orange can ran out I purchased 2 more here at Amazon, one for myself and one to pass on to a friend. I love this stuff so much I had to share it with someone. No rusted bolt can survive this stuff!
B000CDCCN8|5|3 years later, I finally have to replace these wipers.<br /><br />I live in KY, so these have survived all 4 seasons and weather types.
B00GSAUHB8|4|I did not have access to a tape measure (we are in the middle of a move and living out of suitcases right now), but I definitely recommend anyone with a van, truck or SUV take the time to measure their windshield before ordering (car owners should be fine). The diameter of the circles in this shade are 6-8 inches too small for an Odyssey windshield - when you flip down the sun visors in the van, the shade is still about 3 inches too small to reach the extended visor and therefore cannot be held in place. I think this is a decent shade, but I did not find the additional &#34;flap&#34; of fabric that extends beyond the circles to be helpful - it is not convenient to try to reach across the vehicle to spread it out into the corners to cover the glass (this is why I deducted one star - I think I'd prefer oversized squared off shades that overlap - that is what our last shades were like, but we left them in our old van when we sold it). I contacted the company to ask if they made a larger shade (they do not), and even though this shade will not be usable for us, I was very pleased to receive a return response within the hour. I'd order this product from them without hesitation if you've already pre-measured.
B0012TUILO|5|very satisfied with product
B007CJ6INK|5|Works good , just take you time installing  I messed up the first by over tighting the bolts to the glass and assembly  . Breaking the glass and getting a piece of glass in the cable it worked for awhile but sounded terrible . Look for a you tube video to get you started then plan your install you should've get it right the first time ,just take your time .
B00KZJQ2L2|5|great sunshade. works perfectly and looks neat. thanks!
B0047DDB70|5|Excellent replacement option
B005BNZ6WI|5|these little bags are a great invention.
B000CN709E|5|perfect
B002LOP5IA|5|Best care detailing product for cleaning your car rims. Stands up to repeat usage. I wash my rims 2times a week. Still looks brand new. EPIC RIM CLEANER.
B00VJ28KP0|5|Looks really good.
B0040CZ3SS|4|Worked great
B00RGZWIW0|5|Received this in the mail yesterday & it's perfect!  It helped me organize my reusable shopping bags, first aid products, emergency kit, my sons travel goodies, AND other misc items.  I can't believe how much I was able to fit - and it's all neatly organized!  It's very sturdy can easily be stored when not in use.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
B00HESFIJ4|5|I like this pressure gauge a lot. You press it onto the valve for a second, it reads the pressure and holds it, until you press the button on the side of the stem. This same button can be used to release pressure from the tire (or whatever) to easily fine tune to the desired pressure. It reads to 100 psi. I would highly recommend this pressure gauge for home use for bicycles, cars, etc. It is quality made in China for an American company, and that keeps the price reasonable.
B00ORDI23S|5|Great... Perfect fit.
B0000AYCG3|4|Parts fit our boat perfectly.
B005CWSBT8|1|Scooter ran terrible when I installed this carberator . Ended up putting the old one back on. Very sluggish no power.
B0008FUHPA|5|Just what I expected, Amazon Service and Price, Reese Quality. What more could you ask?
B00144D77E|5|HOOKED IT UP TODAY AND ALL WENT PERFECTLY. THE LETTERS ON MY SWITCH WERE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THIS ONE.
B000WOB6UC|5|It's a Race Tech product so it works. Like any suspension modifications you'll appreciate it more as your understanding of your suspension grows. The effects are immediately noticeable.
B00279P2OQ|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B00IGKVOQK|5|Got this kit for $20. The valve stem seals were $10 each at the dealer by themselves. If you were to piece all these out at the Honda dealer, the kit would be around $100! Gasket kit includes: base gasket, head gasket, head gasket stud Oring, valve stem seals, timing Chain adjuster Oring, tensioner lock Oring, valve cover gasket and exhaust pipe flange gasket.  The parts in this kit are good quality, part shipped at a reasonable speed and the fit was perfect. Between this kit and a new set of piston rings, the little bike has full compression, no leaks and does not smoke anymore! Highly recommended for anybody rebuilding an XR80 top end!
B000BWI33S|4|Pretty good keychain considering I bought it for 3 something. \m/ UP THE IRONS! \m/
B003RQBKLC|1|Warning! Be aware! Save your money, don't believe from what their ads says about this product its a crap piece of s#*^! I had it for over a month then suddenly went out of order....im guessing  from its own fuse onboard that cannot handle waving current or high-low current coming from the car... who ever made these should go back to their drawing board and make all improvement they need before selling this product...i want to return it but they said my window frame for returning this item is already gone....to make it short, my money is GONE!
B001GJ3FIS|1|We had it less than a month and it blew a hole thru hose... Very disappointed
B000C34KV0|5|I couldn't locate a squeek in my engine bay somewhere in the rotating assembly of my Pontiac Grand Prix.<br /><br />A few mechanics told me about this belt and how it eliminates &#34;some&#34; squeels if there is an alignment issue. Sure enough, squeek went away. Very happy with the purchase. One head ache removed so A+ from me
B00EKTB93E|5|Very happy with my older
B00Q3CRAF2|2|Does not fit 1997 f-150 bench seat with integrate headrests. Way too short, stretches and rips when just barely trying to put it on. The material it is made of seems to be alright, but this is for small seats, maybe s-10. Guess I will just toss it and get a different one.
B00IXDN0Y4|5|Awesome customer service and a great product. Nice bright lights that look great!
B001FHC15Y|5|These fit well, have good stopping power, and so far I haven't noticed quite as much dust on my wheels as the factory pads emitted.  They are a little more quiet too.
B000LW1TRU|4|Great Product!!!!!!!
B00NEL6HT0|5|Excellent product. I can feel the difference when switching to this brand.
B000ET525K|5|I have had a plug in my wheel for a year( probably not smart) but the point is that is is still holding up and I have had no leakage or breakage of the plug. Great quality. P.S<br /> I would recommend not using this as a permanent fix
B00OQ1G7BU|5|Been working well so far after 1-2 months.
B00D38VTB0|5|Ive had these mats for about two years,  very sturdy and great design.  True to picture.
B0014KQ6BW|5|As a replacement for original 2003 Ford Escape tailgate/liftgate actuator. Took around 3 hours to install as this is totally different size and shape from original Kienert's. Manage to hook it using cable tie and a tweak on the lock assembly. Works well for the past 3 days!
B00TI68FZ4|1|Parts don't match with my 2007 Nissan Altima. They are smaller and shorter than my old rivets.  As you can see on the picture (the one that fits my car is on the left and what I bought is on the right).
B007TXXKWG|4|Watched a Youtube video to install this and got it done with minor problems. The product works.
B001GEJ9NS|5|This cover fits like a glove, all the way under front & rear, and almost to the ground. My original delivery date was to be about 2 weeks away, but I needed it sooner. I contacted the seller, and Lee Ackerman really came through. If I could accept a different color, he had a grey version in stock  (I ordered black), and could have to me in 2 days. 2nd day FedEx was an extra $24.50, but worth every cent.<br />Great product, good price, and excellent customer service. What more could you ask for?
B009XQKCQY|5|Works great. Draws very little current, so I had to make all-new connections all the way back to the battery. Actually, it draws so little current that even a the switch I wanted to use dropped the displayed voltage 1 or more volts, so I hard-wired it. It doesn't pull enough juice from my battery over several days to matter. The readout agrees with my volt meter. The display is bright enough to see just below my other instruments on my motorcycle, but not too bright as to be distracting. It's hard to read in direct sun, but I just shade it with my hand to get a readout when that's necessary. It's small enough to be easy to choose a mounting location.
B009BBCH3C|5|One of the best, keeps the heat out and saves the interior. Helps our car stay cool in those hot California summers. Didn't get the color we wanted to, but overall a great buy. Would buy again for future cars!
B00CI93ZKI|5|Cute. Ships quickly.
B004JV6OMO|5|As I expected and worked perfect for my application.
B00LM4OQMG|5|When I saw this on a couple of buddies bike I had to have one. It was easy to install and works great for me.
B004PILLZG|5|Used this under the dog house (engine cover) to help control the heat I felt on my right foot when driving the E-450 Motor Home. Did not eliminate the heat but certainly reduced it from HOT to a little warm.
B0050SFVHO|5|Item was shipped fast and I would buy again.
B00K35VT3Y|5|Works great!  Replaced factory one that started leaking freon.  Will definitely recommend to other mechanics in my area.  Thanks for a good quality product and fast shipping too!
B00BJJZO1G|4|Perfect fit except for the plug that needed to be spliced from the old mirror.  Hopefully, the differently colored mirrorswon't be too noticeable!
B00CKZVF20|5|great pipe for the price
B000P3L7AY|4|great bike cover and it fits great as well over my husbands goldwing
B00V4RND02|5|Perfect fit  for our Hyundai Veracruz 2008
B000BQQP52|4|I installed on my Warn x8000i and it fits pretty good. It's the only cover I could find for this winch.<br />My only reservation is that the bungees go around the bumper and I do make contact with obstacles from time-to-time with my bumper when doing heavy duty wheeling.
B00H7H1PBC|2|too much work to get the steering wheel cover on and now I have to  completely remove my back seat?
B008G296ZO|5|On time delivery and fitment was good
B00NH76534|5|Perfect color match for those dings
B00X569GS8|2|Looks good but they are put on using double sided tape. One insert is already coming off.
B00HZ51G7O|4|Perfect fit, looks great. I do wish it was just a little bit darker, looks kinda very dark grey
B00JF5FAHO|4|Good so far. Great price.
B002P8SNCC|4|It fit perfectly
B008K8HGAQ|5|Works great love the power and fuel economy. It opened up my 2010 Ram 1500 Hemi 4x4 Crew cab. Install was easy done it by myself. I have always been a K&N user and fan but now with this S&B I am going to use them from now on. My fuel MPG went up and My truck has a lot more power when I step on it
B00JA3BMDW|5|Good deal
B002GTKAHQ|4|good bargan for a necessary item.
B007VDDP5Q|5|Great deal.  Works just fine..
B00H9Z1BLG|1|Stop working after three months no good
B00GTQJUUA|5|Installed it and it works great!
B00EC0ZJGO|5|A++ Great eBayer. Saved a lot of money over dealer.
B000C39C72|4|replaced the factory emc control on a 1985 camero for the fan when switching back to a carb engine without a ecm, worked well
B00WF9GOMC|5|Worked well  put in boat and both cars.
B00HOLSLZO|4|All perfect but 15 days for arriving Europe!!
B004VDTKJ4|4|I was happy with them don't know why one handle has key whole an the other does not!
B000VASNF8|2|Lasted long enough for my emissions check. Now the check engine light goes off, and on due to this o2 sensor.
B0031BNA3Y|5|Comfortable addition, easy installation, prompt shipping and good packaging.
B00HS5RT4A|5|Nice looking on the car.Very quiet stopping.Only on my car 3 weeks.Very happy so far.To be continued.
B00QPV8B22|4|I haven't used the brushes yet, but they seem to be made very well and I think will do an excellent job of clearing off snow.
B002UC4TJO|5|really tuff parts....
B00FSC5T92|5|Very good product. How I expected
B004PL4H0O|5|Great straps for tying down my kayaks for transport.
B004A67GHU|4|Works as expected, with the quality expected from MSD.
B00FH8P1DG|5|it is quite bright, but kinda got used to it. I might add a second one
B004YNORYE|5|perfect fit excellent product
B001CAB9ZM|4|The heater/ac fan in my 1999 Ford F150 would only operate at the highest/fastest setting.  This part was an exact replacement for the damaged part.  No special tools were required for installation; and the fan now operates as intended.  We are very satisfied.
B001DH4BYU|5|Works awesome! Holes lined up perfectly and blows strong!
B001GK9EQE|5|Fit my applicaton perfectly
B00CJ2MT10|5|perfect thanks john p.
B000CQ002A|5|Great product. Easy to custom fit.
B00ARJPF2C|5|So far so good..... Quick service thanks
B003FFVI8A|5|Good value
B00OPBDCDM|5|they are beautiful on the jeep  the black sets off the front end<br />money well spent
B004AQZUX2|5|Ordered from ORIGAMIA. Build quality seems decent. Both headlight bulbs functional. Came well protected. Definitely a tad more blue than the stock bulbs. They seemed to be seated tightly so I don't expect any issues. Hopefully they last but if not it's a cheap replacement.<br />Read the forums for your car for tips on installation. Mine was a pain on a MK5 GLI but I managed.
B00AKJ0OG6|5|Fit perfect and looks great!!
B002JH7PEQ|5|Used it to power my old 60 watt soldering pencil tool to melt part of the speaker basket brackets on my honda odyssey in order to put speakers that require more mounting depth. Worked perfectly.
B00EB03YEE|5|Fit well. Glad that I bought it.
B006YTQR4E|5|Good price, fast delivery
B004DRWP54|5|nice lights good fit
B00062YACG|4|would have given a 5 star but one of the gaskets was missing,other wise came quickly and did what it was supposed to..
B009RC2HVC|5|Shipped quickly, installed easily and works great.
B00ABZC4Y4|5|They are beautiful! They also work and look great.
B00TPM7UTI|5|The starter fit and works perfectly.Still cant believe I got it for that price (3 times cheaper than a marine site).
B00GUHUG8I|4|Terrific vintage looking lamps
B006MIXJFM|5|Perfect !
B000GV0T4A|5|Drag raced my bike probably 3 nights and ride every week for a year and still holding up well
B0100KSILW|5|This is a great steering wheel cover, I purchased it because I thought it was cute and as an added bonus it also helps to keep the wheel from getting so hot in the summer sun.  The material is a little slippery but after a minute or two I was used to it and it hasn't been a problem.
B006ORPTFO|1|Breaks easily from the back
B001UCB1C8|5|Worked great in my Pontiac G8 GT. Paired immediately with my TPS system and cost a whole lot less than the dealership alternatives.
B00O2KV9ZE|4|Looks nice and appears to be of good quality. I would have given it 5 stars if they had included the necessary nuts&bolts to attach it to the scooter.
B00HJ6RV3C|3|Be aware the the picture shows white but the product is grey.
B00FQ0TAC8|5|Good
B00H2VVQNU|5|Great product that really works on controlling rust !!!!!
B00EC0Z1GC|1|No it doesn't fit and it was broken ...when it came
B00M1X6F9Y|3|The construction of the unit is good.  The paint and shipping was horrible.  My unit just arrived, bubble wrapped at the bottom of a big box instead of in the middle.  The paint was scratched off around the two inch hitch and will have to be touched up.  Other wise I really like the unit.
B004ZFMY0K|5|Solid gear
B00B2AFKP2|5|Extremely easy to install on my 1996 Jeep Cherokee.<br />This fit perfectly, was self-explanatory, and felt very sturdy. Just be careful to note that the bolts are not all the same size. Two are shorter, and two are longer.<br />Looks great, along with the rest of my lift.
B005ZWAHE2|5|Very easy to install. Great product
B00GXRG64I|5|These are so worth the money. Super soft, very plush and thick and absorbent. Excellent.
B00EC0Z054|5|Fit perfectly on the car like factory.
B00REJXGME|5|Definitely can't beat the ease of install, the quality of the materials and workmanship along with the price. Highly recommend.
B00GPGVSKY|1|Unless you are a mechanic, don't buy this.  A very small bubble pack with 8 very small pieces - no description, no guide, no explanation & definitely no instructions.  Come on, guys, would a tiny piece of paper showeing some sort of guide have cost a lot?  A total waste for me.
B000JI9J8W|5|Great instructions, cleverly bolt placement. (Wire)
B002E3648I|5|Works just fine.
B005GX3GFW|2|Way to big for standard steering wheels... I have a 1 ton chev van with soft wheel.  Had to put pvc pipe and inner tube liner and it still loosened up... Look for a smaller diameter knob clamp..
B0000AY9W6|5|product is as advertised
B002PQOCWE|2|Both units had a manufacturing flaw in the same location, a crack that could eventually be the point of water/moisture issues. The flaw cannot be detected until you remove the protective lense covering, The protective covering is there to protect the lense so you do not remove it until the unit is installed. The seller claims that the warranty does not cover installed items and yet it has a one year warranty these people are to be watched I would not buy from them again!
B00K6ZWSWM|5|Fit great on a 2015 Rav 4, looks great and includes everything needed. I trimmed the plastic cover to allow it to fit, but you could also remove it.
B003ZUED8M|4|Good  quality good . Bewsre they  do not  come with  bulbs or connectors on lens .
B00KM2POWA|1|The straps are too short to secure a small size bike frame to the wheel.  They are thin and don't hold.  They are made of cheap material and are overpriced.  Do not buy.  Get bungy cords.
B001U0CFU2|5|Couldn't believe how many clothes I got packed in this quality leather bag. Easy on and off too. Best investment I've ever made in motorcycle luggage!
B00LLU7ALA|5|Does a great job.  love it!
B0064DIZXG|5|Who are you
B00GOW6VAQ|5|We are very pleased with this! It is good quality and fit perfectly!
B001I9JKPI|4|Was not sure how many stars to give it, want to give it a 5 but wrong parts means it gets a 4. The deflector itself looks great on my 2014 Murano Platinum but the clips provided were TO BIG to go in the holes. I think they put the wrong bag with the clips and instructions in the package. Instructions said put the 6 clips provided in the 6 holes of the bug deflector, there are only 4 holes. To work around this I went to Canadian Tire and bought some of those plastic universal clips that usually hold door paneling on, trimmed them down and used them, they hold the deflector in place fairly good. I actually installed the rubber seal again to give it a snugger fit, hood closes nicely. I will write the company to see if they will mail me the proper clips.
B005DKIIJW|1|It is a great concept and feature rich with a range of charging and connection options at a great value.  I enjoyed the voltage level and FUL indication indicating a total charge.  This charger worked well for the first year then it began developing issues and after two years, it is defective.  The FUL indicator rarely appeared after the first several charges, difficulty selecting battery voltage levels, difficult or impossible to select options necessary to charge your batteries, the wiring connection allowing you to change connectors became defective, the fan became noisy, and the charger success rate reduced to one successful charge out of ten.  The original factory golf cart chargers are 100% more effective and the charging times are half that of this charger.  I was satisfied at first then total failure and I purchased an original charger, happy again.  Do not waste your money.
B00A2YGDXM|5|love it fits just right in my nitro
B011Q18D14|5|Purchased the OxGord CAN OBD ll OBD2 scanner tool for my husband. We are always busy and can not run our car into the shop for every little problem. My husband plug up the scanner our sons car and it worked quickly and easily. The code came up and they were able to fix the problem without having to take it in to the shop and pay huge amount of money just to found out it needs something as small as a fuse or wire. It not only saves us money but time as well. I would have to say this is a must for anybody who works on cars or just the average weekend warrior. Very Pleased with the purchase and Highly praise this brand of scanner.
B002IV4KFA|5|Good
B00062ZDAO|3|it did its job and made my wire set look a lot neater!
B00IZK54R6|5|on time exact match  heavy construction  it works  thk guys
B003F6R9Z0|4|For the money these are very good. Stylish and low key with a nice finish that holds up pretty well. Yes the grade of plastic isn't as good as OEM wheelcovers, but if installed properly, they work well. The metal ring needs to be pre-adjusted to fit your application.  They may not fit every application, but this should be easy to determine WITHOUT breaking them.  I've had them on my late 90's sedan for a year and never lost one.  They aren't that resistant to High heat.  I had a sticky brake caliper which heated up the wheel and mis-shaped one cover. Otherwise, they held up in all normal situations through all four northeast seasons. Will buy again!
B007UQ80VS|1|The only time this item looks good is when it's not installed in the truck. It does not fit anywhere nearly as good as stock. Had to be modified just to get it in. I ordered another one from a different manufacturer and it looks a lot better. Don't waste your money.
B00A1AIW8Q|5|I have a 2004 Yukon XL and I had been hunting for tail lights that would work with the barn-door-style rear door. I had purchased other tail lights from another online retailer that said they would fit, but didn't. These however DO fit with the barn-door-style rear doors.<br /><br />I've had them installed for several months and are quite happy with them.  The installation was really easy. I am by no means a mechanic or mechanically inclined but was able to install them myself in about 30 minutes. They plug right into a circuit board underneath the vehicle.<br /><br />One concern I had with the tail lights is that I wasn't fond of the non uniform pattern of the LED's. However, after installation, it became a non issue. The non uniform pattern isn't as pronounced in person as it is in the photo.<br /><br />Overall I am really pleased with the tail lights, they really update the look of my Yukon.
B00OFRFM34|1|Can't use. Does not fit in my 07 tacoma factory switch slot. Sucks,looks cool tho wish I could
B004GCR3Z8|1|I have a 04 passat, and ordered this product thinking it was a bargain, and a direct fit. Instead it's a nock off, don't fit too good guess that what get for 50 something bucks
B00TYY3LJU|3|Not [[ASIN:B00TYY3LJU Marshall Instruments MS00015 Liquid Filled Fuel Pressure Gauge]]  Gauge was only filled half way. I followed bleeding procedure as instructed bleeding procedure as (http://www.marshallinstruments.com/faqs/detail.cfm?id=26#venting). Partially my fault the plug shot-off as I pressed it to the side for venting. I recommend not purchasing this item. There are better Fuel Pressure Gauges you can buy, spend the extra money for a better brand.
B00OB8E1ES|1|I got this item and mountd it to my Harley without wiring it up. I wanted to see how it wuold fit it best and how it would handle driving. Good thing I did. First, this is a plastic chrome item, I have very little faith it would work if it got exposed to rain/water. Second, the way this thing is connected to the mount is not very stable, it will move when youu either plug in or unplug and I could see this falling off the mount. Third, with in 10 minutes of riding the cover for the cigarette ligther fell off, I have no idea where that went. I am returning the item and will not buy another of these. I will just break down and buy the Harley charging unit and a very high cost.
B00ECGWRHC|2|A good watch, but not secure enough. It disappeared from my handlebars after a few hours of riding and flew off somewhere
B008ACZ5G4|5|I ordered two of these one had a black cap one had brass cap on top of the diaphragm so far I've only installed one. I rejet it to 85 and put a cone cool air filter on. I gained about 5mph. Both of the carbs say made in Japan  they are fully adjustable as well. Driven the scooter now about 50 miles starts up awesome and the engine sounds so much better as well.
B008BRJ5FA|5|Worked great for the fog light in my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! Easy to install.  Local Napa wanted $28 for this item!!!
B00T0TZYK8|4|Kind of small but good detail.
B00BV1OKVW|4|Good!!!
B00BOGROQ2|5|Love it.
B007K27EVY|5|It looks good
B00308BTO0|5|This hangs on my rear view mirror. i love it!
B0006307WW|5|You can never go wrong with K&N
B00JIJ4LWW|5|I've been using this to maintain the leather in my Jeep Grand Cherokee and it's been great! It makes the leather feel and look like new. One bottle seems like it will last for quite a while. Will definitely buy this again when I run out.
B00EYGCBEO|1|DO NOT BUY THIS TAIL!!!!! It is a baby fox tail :( I have two other tails and this one is tiny compared to them and way to soft (like a kit) it is half of a half of my adult for tails :( (i would add a picture but it wont let me?!?!)
B00GKMWGE0|5|It came just like promised and what a difference in the reception.
B009WF15EO|5|I had the factory bearing go bad and start howling. I chose this one because it said it was an upgrade and was still a good price. I was really happy with my choice. the bearing seemed better built, and it made my primary dead quiet.
B00T8BJ3SM|1|Not pleased
B001KRXW52|4|fit well no issues'
B007O5GXOG|5|Works great!
B00D1Z5XSA|5|Thanks
B006V64P2Q|5|Just plan humor at a really perfect price!!! Thanks team keep up the awesome job!! Customer for life!!
B000VKNT2A|5|Fits 2010 Hyundai Elantra Touring. No complaints.
B0087GRB1K|4|Bolted up very well. But it was 180 degrees off. I had to turn it but since my car, 95 honda civic ex, doesn't have an oxygen sensor it didn't really matter. Over all, very happy with this product. I also have the full cat back exhaust by spec D and it sounds very good.
B000O3PI6O|5|Course file works great, a medium would be nice. The fine is kinda worthless.
B001P2HU5A|5|These are nice running boards. Exactly as described. I easily installed these myself. They look great on my truck!
B000EQESR6|4|Well, without fancy lab equipment, I can't really be sure how this filter performs.  I like the fact that it has a pre-filter.  It fits just fine and you can't beat the price.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it feels pretty light.  Not sure if that means anything.
B00OPJFTOE|5|Good quality. Looks great.
B001JT16LS|5|No problems with this case. Very sleek and professional looking and does the job well. I love all of the pockets and places to put things in. Plenty of choices and goods for the wallet,  what else do toy need!
B0002M9PB6|5|These worked and fit great, sound nice, also mine did come with collector gaskets and decals!
B000C9LSTQ|5|It fits the Ford big block straight 6 perfectly. Not much more to say
B00AK1J5LY|1|Back seat covers do not fit 2015 ram rear seats. Steering wheel cover seams are already falling apart..
B0039HHWNO|5|This item was a perfect fit for my 2005 C55 AMG. Quality was very similar to the OE item that I removed. I was able to use a Lisle tool to close the supplied clamp.
B004SNJPV0|5|just as ordered works great
B008XKLAFI|4|works good
B00EDWF1BE|5|Great product...very rugged and adds that extra touch to making your Jeep stand out.
B002UJVNFA|5|I only wish you could pick the three you want rather than get one of each type. I read from a previous review that you could contact the seller and tell them your preference, but that IS NOT TRUE. I tried that and was told that you get one of each. I prefer the polarized pair the best. Good Value for quality goggles!
B0017UBHQS|5|exactly as described. took left overs to my local mechanic for his work. good price
B00IDW3V1M|5|Just what I needed, fit like the one I took out.
B0002Z9L7G|5|I hate slipping seat belts, being larger in the chest area, some tend to choke me, but this fixes that issue. so glad i got these
B00JRE38EA|2|Good brightness, good color temp., reasonable price, but at only 3 months in, currently sitting at a 40 percent failure rate. A decent low cost gamble, but don't buy into the 4+ star review. Longevity isn't there.
B0093JM1WE|5|Fits works good
B000EQJUV0|4|These pads are silent on the car. They install quickly and easily with the help of some youtube videos. The best brake job we've ever had! You won't be sorry you purchased them. I can't speak to overall longevity because they were installed less than 6 months ago.
B00G5OGTN2|1|Float valve not working right out of the box. Bowl overflows. I may have given a better review because it seems to be almost exactly what it is replacing but really?
B004BTOH5A|5|Great value. Used in Ford ranger 3.0 V6. Best to replace every 100,000 miles
B000P4SA1M|4|Does as promised.
B0031BUDHA|5|Good quality gasket at a good price.
B0038KVOZE|5|great deal
B00FLFWGPG|5|works great. ez enough to install. better design than oem.
B002Y1SXHA|2|Needs to have a little more length of velcro. Too small.
B00KWETZS2|5|Great customer service was not sure if it would fit so I sent an email. They guaranteed it would arrived promptly and was a OEM PRODUCT. I would buy from them the next time I need a part. Great price.
B00KY6M8SW|5|Complete instructions did not come with the item, but the vendor immediately emailed me<br />complete detailed instructions that worked fine.
B000COCTXA|5|Great fit on my 2003 pt cruiser gt turbo!
B001U8MPMM|1|Incredibly difficult to put on seats. First try the zipper ripped out. I even read the directions and watched the video as suggested by the manufacturer. They looked nice in the box.
B00DHPY2E0|5|Was exactly what I expected.  Fits windshield.
B0012S61IO|5|First time removing valves. This tool makes it EASY. To replace the valve keepers, you do need to be precisely aligned. If the tool is canted, they won't go back in. A bit of practice makes it easier.<br /><br />A youtube video showed me this tool. Great kit. I'm very happy with it.
B00AVXR7KC|5|Worked as expected
B0019VZYN2|4|They arrived on time and after installing them i noticed that my mileage has improved.  I would recommend these plugs as a good buy.
B000OAW2R0|5|Using this for my motorhome. Quick install, feels solid.
B00FXWLD88|4|Good product. These are a bit strange to work with. DO NOT plug them together until they have the wires attached.
B00DE91T1I|4|The electronics fit nicely and the case seems to be well constructed.  The only complaint I have is that the buttons are really sunken really deep inside the case. Overall a good product.
B00LG07MZE|5|Fits my 2004 Silverado Crew Cab and works just fine in the Texas heat. Had to replace an old sunshade that I had for years.  I do notice that my vehicle is a few degrees cooler using this sunshade so I'm pleased with that.  I'm guessing that my previous sunshade was old enough that some of the reflective properties had diminished, so this new sunshade works better.  Not sure what more I can expect from a sunshade so I have to give it 5 stars.
B005VYEOPM|5|Every jeep needs on
B000GTTM0O|5|My stock plastic cap had swelled over the years. I could barely unscrew it with vice grips. This one looks really nice on the bike and feels solid. It accepted the stock O-ring seal and screwed in very easily. Way better than the stock cap.
B00WIKUFXW|3|It works well.  I area broke the first time we used it, but we tied a knot in it.  Fits s long bed truck, and nothing shifted in the haul.  If it were not for the break on day 1, I would give it 5 stars
B00ARUQ4MQ|5|got it waiting for the passenger side'
B006MX81FA|4|For a 2006 Prius Grey interior, the color matches well. The front seats fit my 2006 Prius perfectly. The headrest covers I didnt use for the headrest.<br />The back seat I only used the bottom portion. The top would have covered the center seatbelt. Overall I like the fit and the quality is great. Much better than my old cloth interior which were showing signs of age.
B000CAINEI|4|Heavy well made product! Nice!
B000EQVYC8|5|Excellent part
B007CTQEG6|5|Ordered these as a replacement for a Chevy Silverado fiberglass bed cover.  The old, factory ones were barely functioning.  These installed quickly and are exactly what I was looking for.  They provide just the right amount of resistance, while holding the cover in the open position with ease.  Great, quality made product that have been working as designed for months!
B00RGZWIW0|5|Purchased as a gift for my mother who loved it!
B00029WVII|2|Did not work for me.
B007TY0G1I|3|It's ok it didn't really fit together and flat were the 2 pieces joined together there should be another clip or something to hold them down and together other than that it was easy to install
B001A6CZBA|3|way to big for what i was using it for.
B00RPS9GQE|5|Easy to install and makes the car look sporty. Not like other brands that look clunky and cheap.
B00UZEML4E|5|Our daughter loves this!!
B0002UHVAA|5|read all over hat I needed to buy a flush king, well after some sticker shock I decided to buy this and boy was I impressed! Cleared out my tank like new and super easy to use.
B008JGDJGE|1|I tried to return this low quality item and they wanted a 50% restocking fee!!! Talk about daylight robbery! I should've read about that and the fact they have NO reviews! Go with BMW/OEM! Way worth the extra money. SHAME ON YOU LTD!
B000C57K9M|5|Perfect fit... Quick install, excellent product.
B007ND4P0S|2|Let me start by saying i don't really enjoy putting down anyone's product but i bought these lights a while ago. However i just hadn't found time to install them ,so i finally did the first week of July i believe the 4th. Let me say they looked great much brighter then the originals. Now comes the part that sucks i started up my car 4 am July 27th and my headlight indicator notification came on that my bulb had blown not one but both. Now i'm no genius but i believe this product should last longer than 3 weeks. So unfortunately if your looking for some lights keep searching cause these aren't it.
B00RVHIB3I|5|Works great!  Installed on a 2016 Yamaha Wolverine R-Spec side by side.  Went on a few night rides already and the LED Bar really puts out the light.  Went with a 90W to not over tax the charging system and it's perfect.  Can have whips, stereo, fan, gps nav..basically everything running and not overdraw the system.
B001447VB2|4|I have used this product over several years and I am very satisfied with the results
B001AY0YO2|4|Seams to be well made.
B00H8743OW|5|Fits perfect.
B008AM1Q8K|2|Love my Globe and Anchor but this decal looks cheap.
B0010DLHI0|5|Seems like good quality and working well after a few thousand miles
B00MJV6YJ4|1|Very flimsy. Ok for paper but no more. Not happy with my purchase at any price.
B000SL4A84|5|Good to have for basic First Aid.
B001P20XZE|3|works fine thought it would be bigger than its actual size
B00GNJBD2G|5|Super! Thank you So much.. Excellent!
B000KZ20HG|5|Great price. It works perfectly.
B007NXTXC8|5|Used in the wood floor of a landscape trailer.  After making a template of the holddown plate, a router was used to recess the hold down.  Made sure a hole was drilled through the wood to permit water to flow through.  Takes some time to install, but great holddown where you want them.
B00IY3YLCI|4|These things are bright.  For the price they are outstanding for the front of my pontoon boat.  One of them won't tighten down all the way but it works just fine as is.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Good
B009ZH4MZS|4|it fits
B003R8D60I|5|It's a great product.  It keeps anything from leaking onto your actual car carpet, which is always a good thing!
B000JP31T8|5|Excellent quality item!
B000C5WCUE|1|Was not right fit for my car.
B00BFDJCPA|5|Just what I expected to get for my lil civic!
B0090SLJ5S|5|Excellent dealer. His product is great.
B007QU4FZ8|5|Great detail
B00144D77E|5|Used them on my johnson outboard worked great
B004W3FKBA|1|WARNING: If running these LED tail lights in the day with your lights on shows little difference between braking and tail lights on.  So if you use your brakes the person behind you may not be able to see the difference.  My wife followed me and complained about it.  I have to keep my lights off during the day or people can't see that I have my brakes on.
B0022XG6Z6|5|what can I say its just bad ass
B0006IX7TW|3|It's ok but there is a dire need for a on and off switch.  You have to take the batteries out to shut it off.
B00GOO421Y|5|great mirror and great price. Very pleased with quality and speed that I received it.
B008MUHIIW|5|The Granite Digital car 12volt battery recharger maintainer tester is 50 watts, its twice the performance. I have another one which is a 25 watt its smaller but updated electronics which can show battery voltage and amps at the same time
B003CKJDW6|4|It is what it is!
B00PXESV2W|5|Awesome cover
B000HM579K|5|Definitely of higher quality than the cheaper ones and has the 5/16 battery studs I was desperately needing. My installation was to replace the factory switch on a Powr-flite 12v walk-behind sweeper. The power cables leading to the switch were not long enough to cut and replace with larger eyelets so having 5/16 threaded studs was my most practical option or to perform a rather difficult re-wiring job.<br /><br />The protective boot that covers the key opening will prevent water from entering, which caused the factory switch to corrode and fail. I didn't need the included bracket but should mention it's very sturdy, perfect for a marine application exposed in a saltwater environment. I bit pricey but good value.
B00HSHW3BM|5|Great deal for the price
B00873J0YY|5|Awesome!!!! Just perfect .. I love them. Easy to set up & take down.
B0087NB23Q|5|Love it!
B0077BRYCM|1|Got the wrong item
B005EKY1EM|5|Just as described
B002FFFKYE|5|This was so worth getting. Unlike the pre oiled filter, takes about ten minutes to oil, and let filter absorb oil, before install. But that's not too bad. Oil packet that comes with is about twice of what you need for this filter. It did create a spiral for me however. I got this filter, and noticed some instant gain in power, as well as a smoother engine. But, it did cause me to make other purchases. I ended up with the cobra slip on as I figured, may as well. And, with how lean the engine was running as the bike does not compensate, ended up with the Cobra Fi2000R fuel tuner. Once I got it dialed in, bike is simply amazing. What it should have been from factory. I can say, did not need the slip on pipe and tuner if just going with this air filter. Definitely want the tuner if you get the pipe. But, if you want to stick with the stock air box and get a little more out of the bike, this is a no regrets buy.
B00192HPOC|5|Nice product sold by Camco. Bought for 2015 28 ft. Jayco Jayflight BHBE. Easy to install.
B00EZBSBHY|5|Don't waste your money buying replacement tail lights from your local Mazda dealer or specialty parts supplier.  These lights are the EXACT same units you will receive if you order from the dealer--right down to the blue Mazda stickers on the box.  The lights themselves are stamped with the Koito name, the OEM supplier to Mazda.  They even include the updated thicker gasket to prevent the common moisture issue that plagued the originals.  At approximately $85 each they are a great buy versus the $150+ dealers charge.
B00JBGCA98|5|They are great! I got it so fast and gave me one to practice!
B000LG8GI6|5|Works great!!
B00T5G53ZM|5|2015 Subaru BRZ Limited<br /><br />This thing works great! I use it with the Torque Pro app and Racechrono Pro App on my Galaxy Note 4 and HTC ONE! I highly recommend this product to see your oil temps, coolant temps, etc...
B00L9KG4Z0|5|Easy installation.  Pretty loud
B0038EOS9Y|4|Looks good for the cheap price. It will do the job
B000DZXIJM|5|Totally amazing, yes, amazing totally.
B009DK4OVY|1|Wasn't the right antenna.
B00FA4MO2I|3|The metal for the seat is a little soft and allows it to bend back and forth.
B000VX9DYA|5|Nice!!!
B00E9D4NES|5|bought two still look good, easy install
B002PQWADW|5|It fit perfectly in my 17 year old car.  It is working well.  Thank you for having the replacement available.  I was told to go to the Toyota dealer.  I decided to check Amazon first.. Amazon came through for me again.  Thank you !
B00BITICRA|5|This part fit my 1998 Toyota Sienna very well.  Color slightly off from pic and original color, but not outlandishly so.
B00A1XDD7I|5|OEM quality part, none of the hassle of going to the dealer to pay more.
B000630204|3|They look neat but really are just hose clamp covers.  Regardless they still work great.
B00KBJ8X0E|4|good deal
B0013G0J9W|5|The stars must have been aligned when I found this real Chevrolet Performance HEI on Amazon for $148.  It's made in Taiwan, but that's 10X better than some no-name unit from China.  It has a melonized gear for roller cams, and its mechanical advance is set for 35 degrees total when initial timing is set to 10 degrees.  And it doesn't have the all-to-common &#34;look at me&#34; red cap. :)
B007XUISRM|1|Lasted for less than two years and then died.  Of course the warranty was only for a year. I'm sure they know it won't last long. I will never buy from them again. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone.
B00ZB5I65U|5|It's hard to find it, so I'm really excited about it!!!
B002P8B70C|4|This mirror fit my 2006 Ford Fusion SEL perfectly, was easy to install and came complete with the puddle light on the bottom. Great item.
B005JL2WCE|5|This is inexpensive and good for praticial jokers. A++++ seller
B00068WNZG|5|I have used this stuff to polish belt buckles to a high shine with no effort. Simply apply, let sit for 30-60 seconds and wipe off. Done. It will also clean your stainless steel revolver cylinder and get it like new, again, with no effort. I imagine, it has many more uses. Overall way better product than other polishing creams or liquids (like brasso) which require a lot of rubbing and often multiple applications. I love this stuff.
B000ET3WVQ|5|Put these in my 1997 Expedition and it runs great.
B0009IBJE4|1|I think this product was falsely advertised.  It looked nothing like the product I viewed pictured on the website and there is no way this thing could cost $174.00 at any time unless you purchased 7 or 8 of them.  I thought this was going to be some high tech charger with a beautiful digital readout and all of the microprocessor stuff I read about before buying it, but it was basic and extremely lightweight for something marked down from $174.00.  I was very disappointed.
B00DMPQYHI|5|This item was delivered on time and it was  just i expected it to be, i am very happy with my purchase.
B00MQ1DS7I|5|excellent for replacing broken glass simple cheap and easy!
B000EDUTWC|5|Great fit, more brown in color than the pic online, which I preferred, great packing from Amazon.com, would purchase again.
B0031ZDU62|5|Installed and works perfectly! Love the savings.
B00BFLVUDO|5|Battery arrived as expected with a separate container of acid. Easy no spill fill procedure. Let battery sit for an hour as per instructions. Checked voltage and it was up to 12.5 volts by only sitting. Installed on Yamaha XT225 and it had enough power to start bike. Ran the bike for short ride. Started fine. Placed on 1.5 amp charger overnight to bring to full charge. Do not charge at higher rate than 1.5 amp. Battery is holding charge well so far.
B006TMLNW2|5|1st one I received was damaged, company replaced it no problem.  2nd unit is perfect, fits the 2002 Saturn vue perfectly
B009N9O7N0|1|The product I received wasn't the one in the picture above. I receive black but I ordered BLUE!
B00806BUC8|1|Doesn't fit usdm front end mazda 6
B009OFGFNI|4|On time delivery, easy to install, well made of heavy stainless, protects sill from scuffs, just wish they wer about 3 to 4 inches longer to go over the front area of the sill.
B001KQEODC|5|price is right , fits , shipping is great
B00MUF4Q6M|5|High quality, sleek and compact! Organizes my keys nicely and looks great,
B00U88XNEE|5|Love the color and item. Purchased two.
B007SCNLMW|1|It is not good item. I gift this item to my friend . He did not accpt this and say i have no need this type of gift . Its material is very poor.
B0000UUU7I|5|I just replaced a 12 year old Tonneau Cover on my truck because of some sun/weather cracking. I bought this cover as an exact replacement. Everything fit perfect.  The cover looks great. All the required parts were included in perfect condition. I fully recommend this cover.
B004LWV0GQ|5|Husband bought this for the battery recharger....it has been a big help in charging the lawnmower  and even my truck that was having issues for some reason....
B002CNK62K|3|Nice looking caps, but the &#34;frequently bought together&#34; Toyota logos are a bit too large for the center indentation.  I don't know which product is to blame.
B004TRKBOK|5|Perfect for emergency☆☆☆☆☆
B00J3Z5U6M|5|The car mats arrived in a timely manner and were just what I expected. I was pleased with the company and the product!
B0006IX7Y2|4|Works as advertised. Very functional and compact.
B00DNU3MIG|4|Very nice upgrade to my electrical system.  High quality and they are NOT made of LEAD but ZINC which is much more durable/ harder and conducts the electrons better than LEAD.  Also comes with the red and green terminal corrosion stoppers, I find that these actually work.
B004I0Z4K4|4|works good
B0010E00T6|5|Easy install and worth the price.
B00AZPI0NE|5|Super brights. These are floods and not spots for sure. throw lots of light out but not very far like i expected. GREAT light for the money. I have this mounted as a back up light on my tractor
B00HJ6O4A0|5|very nice quality and reasonable price.  easy to carry and provides plenty of seating or clean surface for sunbathing.
B00XZ9PPCQ|5|Works great!
B0040YQXK8|3|Great price. Exact match to my old one. So far it's working perfectly.
B00DQJ9KP8|5|Fit well; easy to install.  Looks much better than the very tall antenna that came on it.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|These are super bright!  We put them on our pontoon to help guide us after dark, as we do a lot of night fishing.  They work great.  We can see the bank after dark and make sure we are not going to hit anything floating in the water.  My only caution is they don't work great when it is foggy, but then again on the water there isn't much going to help when it get foggy.
B000GU0RT8|5|Replaced the factory fender on my 2004 KLR-250.  This is a very well made fender, and looks great on the KLR. Smaller than stock with a lot less flex.  Believe it or not, I have way less wind buffeting at face level along with greater stability at highway speeds.  Highly recommended for dual-purpose bikes used primarily for highway travel.<br /><br />Easy to duplicate the factory hole pattern by putting back-to-back with factory fender and marking hole locations.
B00BITID38|5|This part fit my 1998 Toyota Sienna very well.  Color slightly off from pic and original color, but not outlandishly so.
B004B8GTQG|5|Makes rubbers look like new again, not greasy at all and spreads very well.
B00ZSCK3JS|2|Shirt shrunk after first wash (preshrunk cotton too) and the material is a little thick for a tight fitting shirt. On top of that the print is a little blurry and off centered which is really obvious when it fits so tightly.  Basically it appears as if some kid made it in his garage
B00NVBW5EY|4|They work OK but don't really fit snugly between seats & console.
B0009IQZFM|1|This thing is terrible. I don't really see a difference in this and any cheap normal towel. Ok so it holds more water...well what is the value in holding more water if it leaves streaks everywhere? Even fresh and dry it leaves streaks. I have no idea where all the 5 star reviews are coming from.
B008B5U0S8|5|Great Price$
B008RAEKDS|5|Awesome gasket. Seals very well, NO weeping or wetness weeks after diff service. Makes the job faster and more convenient without the need for RTV. Best thing is this is reusable.
B003V57NUQ|5|Very cheap and functional excellent product for the price. These carriers bolt around the top and bottom of your roof racks and although a bit canted on my ford escape they are very sturdy. I cant imagine these not fitting on any standard roof racks. They  take a bit of time to get withal the bolting down but they are rock solid after that, although this might make it a bit difficult to take them off in the future ( I haven't tried taking them off yet). Although they don't fold over or come off easily these are excellent for what you pay.
B001FTLNMO|3|I used this as a pusher to help the ac condenser. I flipped the fan blades and it worked ok. Definitely not pushing the CFM that it is said to be pushing.
B00JRHPAZ2|5|great product and would buy again!
B00K7YZS9C|5|Works great!!
B00514C01W|4|looks good covered that old aluminum makes it shine
B0031I0NDM|5|nice product worked great
B00ONGV30I|5|Perfect fit and good quality.
B00UZ4NG4S|5|I purchased this for my 2006 Hyundai Sonata. It fit perfectly!<br />Please note- you cannot use the tray that the disposable filter sits in and you also cannot use the cover that sealed in the old paper filter. Remove those and simply slide in this replacement filter.<br />That's all there is to it!<br />Very happy with this cabin air filter. Saves me money and my air doesn't smell like stinky gym socks!
B006PIWH02|5|Very Cute
B004A2T3AM|5|Just put them in my Chevy Trailblazer with 140,000 miles. Again I'm back to the performance that I expect from my engine. Perfect fit and performance. Taking it for a test trip next week, I'll see after another 1000 miles but so far I'm happy.
B000C55T7W|5|They are on and working fine.
B002YZAYNW|5|So cute
B003ZWZ7VM|5|This thing is wonderful and helps a ton in this FL sun
B000FIA11K|5|easy to install,simple to use, fantastic price
B00804ME48|4|These shocks are made in CHINA, that being the USUAL now-a-days, so what else is new huh?<br />Anyway, they do seem to work ( FOR NOW ).  They installed pretty easily and after a week or so now, they are still holding up !<br /><br />Surprise....Surprise...<br /><br />For the money, they are worth it...<br />I'll do a follow-up in six months and if they are still functioning properly, I might even buy the front struts from this company!
B000IYLFFW|1|don't work
B004988DF8|5|Fully expected an aftermarket part for my 2006 Honda Civic LX 1.8, and the belt is, but the tensioner is exactly what was on there from factory. Same markings, same point of origin. Works as I expected it to. There was someone who remarked the belt included is the wrong one, it's not. You simply have to understand how to put on a serpentine belt. For this application you will need an 19MM box end wrench to compress the tensioner once installed so that you may slip the belt over. This is a two person operation. I had my neighbor apply pressure to the tensioner from above while I slipped the belt on from the access panel in the front passenger wheel-well. You'll obviously have to remove the wheel. Also be aware that you'll need to remove the water pump pulley before you can remove the tensioner.
B00AAGDAZQ|5|All Wizards products are Great!
B004I12RXU|5|perfect fit!
B00OLVGIDC|5|very good product ,fit is perfect
B000CL92SS|5|Installation was a charm on my 2005 nissan murano. as to how it will preform, I will have to update after a while. note that when you install the side with the arrow on it must be facing you and for my 2005 nissan murano the arrow needed to be pointing down. your car may and will vary. the quality looks very OEM like to the eye and to the touch. Its one of the cheapest options with odor protection so I have to see how it preforms. Im gonna give it 4 stars for the price and if it preforms well i will edit to give it 5.<br /><br />update: I have done about 1000 miles of driving and I havent ever had any funny smells from outside, being felt inside the cabin. I live in countryside kentucky and its very common to smell skunk when im driving on country roads and I havent smelled it since installing this so i guess that's a thumbs up.
B00943LUMG|3|Worked great the first day ridding around the house. Stopped all dust. Don't drive down the highway with this on. It will shred to peices. I was going 65mph and look back and it looks like a large streamer hanging off my ranger. It was destroyed. Other than that it's great just be sure to not trailer you its with this on. It fit very well also on my 800 ranger midsize
B00N2T7216|5|Little small for my window, but I love it and use it everyday
B00G4S4H24|5|Perfect color match
B00ARD0LHM|3|No way to hold back to tighten self locking nut. Rubber boots are really flimsy  Fits good. Made in China. This is average at best.
B00BX5D9I6|1|Pass bulb doesn't work
B00DLMMZ3Y|5|Worked great so far put them in myself
B00NK9E3O2|1|I wouldn't recommend these to any one, they fit nice but don't stay in place
B000TDQGCE|5|Very good. Secure and good appearance.
B0002Q81Y4|5|easy installation, worked as advertised
B000CGVSNA|5|super rapide
B002R0J1JW|5|Perfect fit easy to install. Works great!!
B004AJ0NK4|3|Not really made for 4runner, have to force them in.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Wonderful SunShade. The temperature in the car is much more cooler after using this sun shade. Also, the size is great because it's flexible. It has two round fixed shapes and the space between the two round shapes are flexible so that you can adjust the size to what you want. In all, wonderful sun shade. worth the price.
B0085BUO84|4|Absolutely love the NOKYA brand. Find there color temperatures to be right on point.<br />Great product for the price.
B004A6K7XU|4|Radiator was great, no problems but it wasn't packed right and apparently it was shipped in back of a pickup truck because it was damaged. The core was bent the Fram was bent and the mounting tabs didn't line up.
B0068MZJT6|5|Good
B00068OJY4|5|My alloy wheels were getting ruined by brake dust. These put a stop to that.<br />They also help cover up my rusty calipers and drums.
B004UTD0RW|3|I though this was going to look awesome on my RAM 1500. The dip in the top of it exposes part of the plate, and makes the effect look crappy. It also hides my expiration sticker.  Looks cool, but it loses stars for not being practical.
B000OC4EII|5|Works great!
B003CEFJ2A|2|Faded within the first month..<br /><br />Beyond that held up..<br /><br />Good as long as you don't mind it being faded.
B001L9ZBXA|5|Love it. Just like the picture
B00FWHZ1T6|5|Original equipment piece, fit perfectly.
B00HLF1NNA|5|Just to make my Audi more luxurious
B00U5UBQE4|5|If you own an Boat or RV then you need one to help save your batteries.  As long as the battery is hooked up there is always a small drain on it, this takes and breaks the voltage drain and helps to prolong the life of your battery.  I've put one on each of our RVs over the years, and have always gotten a longer battery life.
B00Y5GVL1M|5|These are great :)  WAY easier to put on than expected.
B000NW6X8I|3|Some of the parts would not work with the vehicle
B008YZGB7Y|5|FITS GOOD. GRAND DAUGHTER PUTS ON HERSELF NO ARGUMENTS. GREAT!
B00NPQV06O|5|Bright flood pattern.  Worked perfect as a secondary reverse light to my Jeep.
B005LRDBCQ|5|Excellent product easy fix
B001544VOQ|5|the price wasn't to bad parts that we needed
B00NQGCDC8|5|It's great
B00ITJMYPS|5|great fit on the E60 BMW M5. the faux pedal is a little short but not overly noticable.
B0043AV4NK|4|Has a deeper sound but still kind of quite.
B00E6HPFVC|2|The sticker is really cute and looks nice but the vinyl it's made of makes Albert look dull and coincidentally... Isn't very great. I put it on my car and 2 weeks later I had to take it off cause it was starting to peel off...
B0012INT98|5|We bought this to drive from Nashville, TN to Cleveland, OH. I packed it with boxes then stuffed clothes around them to keep them from moving. I had it strapped through the van, since our 2002 Honda Odyssey doesn't have a rack. I probable over packed it, but I made sure it looked like the right shape and zipped up. We also used Rightline Gear 100650 Non-Skid Roof Pad. We had a flat tire and almost a second one. Alot of things went wrong, but this carrier was not one of them.
B00EJLTJ12|5|great price fast shipping
B0024E6ZRW|5|product is as advertised
B000B8JUNY|5|Fit my Scion xA perfectly; hasn't had problems since.
B009DJTE9W|5|Very easy to install similar to original and good price 😉😃
B00AYXM4DY|5|My second purchase of this product.  I originally bought this at Walgreen's in the &#34;As Seen on TV&#34; aisle because at the time, I had a car with black plastic bumpers that always looked dull (Saturn...blaah).  This works exactly as it says it does,  it made them shiny and it lasted.  I got a new car, so I can't tell if it is still lasting,  but even if it only lasts half the time it says it does, its worth it.  My dad used on his truck cover and it works great,  I used on the dash of my new car and it for 4 months now it has looked like it was freshly armor-all'ed.  I panicked a bit when it was no longer at Walgreen's so I found it on Amazon (for $7 less!) and bought it for the couple of places I missed on my dash,  and so that I will have it on hand.
B00XZ9OXP6|4|The product works however had to return it because it did not look identical to the original key. It does not have the Toyota crest on the back. However, if you're not worried about that go for it. Very easy to program. Google for instructions.
B00FABYQ5Y|5|At first, I wasn't quite sure how this cover would look in my car but it worked out perfectly. It looks nice and feels great - I love the grip of this cover.
B00BJMF3HI|5|Check engine light usually means &#34;Replace Gas Cap&#34;<br />My old school mechanic at Hyundai provided me with the tip when I purchased my Azera in 06. He said that 99.9 percent of the time the gas cap seals will fail and vacuum could be lost and Vapors escaping the tank. The engine light should turn off within about 15 to 20 minutes after replacing your cap - the time required might have much to do with how much gas is in the tank.<br />The gas cap is a single click type and of course it's genuine which means it will fit perfectly for twice the price of an off brand. If I didn't feel Hyundai wasn't using great parts, I would have most likely opted for a 3rd party brand.

B00J5E9FJO|5|Great system easy to set up easy to use just what I needed to load the bike by myself
B001CF1A7O|5|Like
B0002WRIA6|5|Great product AAAAA++++
B000EEQ9MK|5|Good
B004A6M8S2|4|Fast delivery perfect fit
B008Y8Y3VM|4|it fit ok but was smaller then the oem
B00N1QEFUG|4|Like the look.<br />Gas Pedal not wide enough for a 2015 Wrangler, will have to modify to use.<br />Break and Clutch pedals fit great.
B0060A7VO2|5|Fit perfectly! I strongly recommend buying this product.  At first I was hesitant but I'm glad I bought it.
B00B26YUNE|5|FAST DELIVERY AND ARRIVED AS STATED
B00BMJF1VG|5|The engine runs like a top now
B001C6N5G2|1|I am sorry, but the line does not fit the auto as described, it is to short and cannot be secured to the strut as req'd. The listing is incorrect as follow up indicates, I am suffering shipping cost penalty, it is not my error.
B007GR4VXC|5|As with other Wizard products I've purchased,it does a good job. It will hide light scratches in paint and plastic too.
B00BISJC1G|5|I have a condition  that makes it painful to sit.  This cushion really helps.  It fits in a large bag.  At sporting events, people have asked me where I got it.<br /><br />I don't leave home without it.<br />July 2017 - they do deflate easily and do not last a long g flight.  My first bat has was so much better than the second batch I received.  I still have them everywhere.  I would give them 3 stars now.
B006WAFIEA|4|nice boxes should work fine for my prodject
B0028OJAIY|5|Works great and easy to use!
B00N14QUD8|5|This oil far exceeds the the low grade oil the BMW dealer uses by a wide margin.
B000BRCEI8|5|Works as advertized
B000MK9M6Q|2|I bought this as a gift for my husband's Trans Am. He likes it and all, but the single oval filter (what is pictured) is what he wanted and we ended up with the dual filters instead. I even reread the product description and it says &#34;filter&#34; as in only one. The clamp that came with it was too small and the bolts were too long. I looked for a way to contact the seller but I can't find one. I'm really unhappy because this isn't the product I ordered, but my husband wanted to put it on his car right away so I can't return it, but we'll have to buy more parts to make it work.
B004I0H86C|4|Was very surprised that it took a few minutes to install just what I needed to replace the old one gives the car a much better look would recommend these
B000AMBOIK|5|nice little charger for the price brought my bike battery back to life
B00U6YTMRM|3|Worked as described
B009DIWCE2|5|These filters are very well made look very sporty easy to clean stay looking new increased airflow ( plus the k&m cleaning kit works perfectly ( note oil is red )
B00JPJFWKK|5|Great mixing cups! Takes the trouble out of mixing multi part coatings. I use this for mixing autobody paint and it save tons of time and helps get consistent results. Although they are disposable, the yankee in me rinses them with an ounce of lacquer thinners and they're good as new. Just mark what you've used for clear as opposed to other coatings.
B00YT1I3LY|5|Point made
B000C2QM1M|5|Works great, plenty of o-rings for probably multiple repairs.
B001AWFTDA|5|Very good battery so fat hopefully it will last as long as my last one.
B00W193O1K|5|the GT style carbon fiber wing arrived weeks before estimated arrival date. Great quality and amazing customer service from the seller to ensure the wing arrived in one piece. I would definitely refer Racing&carbonfiber to anyone looking to get a CF kit of any kind for a cheaper price and amazing customer service. Customer satisfaction is their main concern, very impressed thanks for everything!!!
B00NTSU604|3|Good light but don't use a pressure washer or touchless car wash.  It will overpower the gaskets and cause the lights to fog up.  I have other Kawell lights that have been underwater launching a boat and have been ok.  Just no high pressure water.
B00PYZ3KVM|5|perfect fit. Works as expected, and much less than going to the auto dealer
B00DLMN2P4|5|Quick shipping, great price. I purchased for my Camaro and lights look great at night. Clean and bright but not blinding to other drivers.
B0009YDQEE|3|thin cheap ,could of got better item locally
B003CJHPHW|2|The pattern is different from advertised, and it is poorly centered on a crudely cut piece of flimsy cloth.  Made in China.
B0000AXTUY|5|Excellent charger to install and leave it connected 24/7. I've had one on my generator for five years and it starts every time.
B00335F7RU|1|Didn't fit right.
B0029V9DRY|5|Very nice
B00C6MT1IM|5|Excellent german quality part, I recommend this brand.
B00AMPHP88|5|Real nice mats
B000OAXP6M|5|Good
B000RW1XO8|5|Best price available anywhere.
B0002UQATS|5|wax is good and lasts
B007IW0AYO|5|Overall, I'm happy with the quality and how they look on the car. As far as 100% fitment, you won't get that unless you have OEM. None the less, it fits really damn close.<br /><br />DOES NOT FIT WITH COLD AIR INTAKE. Keep that in mind while buying. I have an Injen CAI into the wheel well, and it didn't fit while installing since the back of the headlight housing extends farther than the OEM ones do.<br /><br />Other than that, these light up the road like no joke and look great! My girlfriend said it looks like a rainbow driving down the road now. Killer work & extremely happy with them this far.
B001GJ3FIS|2|The middle screw comes undone and causes havoc. Design flaw!
B00LQ7AFAQ|1|I installed this at the end of September 2014 and by August 2015 the flex pipe had already rusted through and has a large leak it.
B007ZLMNAW|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B007E2X338|5|Good quality. Adds a great touch to antique car and motorcycle.
B00XOVFA16|4|Very cool keychain, a little large though it certainly could have been bigger. It has slightly sharp points on the inside portion of the handle, otherwise really cool. Would have been awesome if it could transform like the trick weapon it is in the game, but really cool nonetheless.
B004RCS95U|5|2004 Audi S4, perfect fit.  When new, leave a bit of hazy residue on inside of windshield.  Residue wipes off easily.  Easy to roll up.  Has not disintegrated after about 2 months of daily use.
B007KIUDBQ|2|When will go power step up the rest of the way with a mppt? And higher voltage? But over all good jut keep it under 15 bots from the panels.
B008G3AD0A|5|Very happy! Easy to install.
B002P8QP5O|5|Looks good as original what else could I ask for.
B00BFEGPIG|4|works fine
B00I0H28AK|4|I think they're nice seat covers BUT they DID NOT fit my rear seats in my 2011 Jeep Compass like Amazon said. They did arrive one day late. Otherwise, if they were on time, and fit correctly I would be very happy. It's not the cheapest material but not the best. Comfy, non-stick. Hoping I can find some like this that will fit. I'll probably have to go with the lame mopar covers. 😕 the steering wheel cover also does not fit.
B000UU40TW|5|Made for our vehicle so it fits the windshield and helps to keep the heat out. It also rolls up nicely for (though not small because it is heavier material) for storage in the back seat.
B003ZOL4SK|5|It fits our motor home very well. It looks good and works just like it was advertised.
B00FLB7GAA|5|Excellent communication, fast and easy transaction, item is exactly at described and it Fits perfect! E90 328i sedan , 2009...
B0013FBKDC|1|Did not work with 1991 camaro should have taken heed from other reviews
B00WFHUNEO|1|doesn't make a difference
B00OK6SQGK|4|It is not the same size as what is on the truck , close enough though. It is going to work very well.
B005IZHKIW|5|I loved these.  Not only because I'm obsessed with Peace signs, but I also love the color purple.
B00QJ1IX4O|5|This is a must have on the Slingshot... The amount of wind and element protection is pretty surprising.  Also, the center support is set up to hold accessories via ram mount.
B00FRHOLK6|5|Quality and fast shipping.
B000C84740|5|Exact fit for 97 Ford van. Miss the strap that held the old one but no big deal
B00I93R4UO|5|Easy install, works great very happy with this product
B00M22HLA6|5|Love my new decal. Thought it would have been a little bigger but still cute.
B001O939WM|5|These rotors are very beefy, well-balanced, and they have been wearing very well since they were installed. Be sure to have brake cleaner handy (and shake it before use) because these have a corrosion-inhibiting oil applied to them you need to clean off before installation.
B000AO8ZA8|5|Looks amazing
B0006IX7Y2|5|Just as described
B003WYZR0E|5|it is nice
B00CQD4BUE|5|Pricey, but nice.  Much better than OEM.
B00NES10CM|1|I ordered this item and was very exited to use it in my new SUV car but when i received i was disappointed,,not because of the quality or the dimensions every thing is good but the item has a BAD ODOR and it get's even worse when the car is under the sun !!!!!! i putted it in my car and the next day i immediately removed it cuz did't want my 7 month's old baby to get sick or even me and my wife.<br />So i don't recommend this item specially if u have baby's....
B00SGGWK7Q|5|I think it makes my car look cute
B00HVA3YBE|5|Very nice. My company Ford Escape 2015 didn't come with a tray and all and this is a big improvement over just a cavernous hole. Fits great.
B00E9LPIHQ|5|it fit my wife's 2010 venza and now on road trips I don't have to lessen to her talk..
B000GKD6VY|5|Exactly as advertised
B008MISDH4|4|:)
B000U0Z2L2|4|Great Product!!!!!!!
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works perfectly. Every bike owner should have one.
B000Q73A1S|1|it never worked. wish I could have sent it back for a refund.
B007U9EXVQ|5|Awesome
B003V5PEQG|5|Great product.. Works great..
B00009PGNS|5|Perfect for a days worth of drinks and munchies for 2-4 people. It quiet and keeps the food cold. Love it!
B00252928M|3|Chrysler did not run well with it for unknown reason.
B00PB8FJUW|5|This inner tube is exactly what I wanted.
B008CE0R5E|5|Use these for my boat trailer. Very sturdy and work well. Good product.
B001650QPC|5|Just as many others said, these highway pegs are crudely cast and still had some rough flash showing. They installed tightly on my 1&#34; crash bars and work very well. I wasn't sure I wanted highway pegs and for the low cost I was able to give them a try without worry. At some point in the future, they will bend, I know this , then they will need to be replaced OR repaired with better quality parts. WORTH THE LOW COST!
B008R53CTQ|5|Easy and fast install
B000BQW5LK|5|Great little pump. Perfect for differentials or transfer cases. Was a little skeptical because of the cheaper price, but works amazingly. Well-built with no leaking or broken components.
B00VSMG4IQ|5|[[VIDEOID:3a38c133dd053a80246969faa774beab]] \\"This thing works great! Scanner worked fine for resetting SRS light£¬easy to use. Better than going down to the local auto parts store.<br /><br />For SRS, it has different options for different vehicle, you can find it in the end of my video. (That list was provided by Amanada.) I had a minor issue<br /><br />with it, Amanda went above and beyond to correct the issue. I would definitely recommend this seller and I will continue to do business with them! Great<br /><br />customer service! Thank you! \\"
B0041E8VZ2|5|Gumout has been around for a long time. I run a bottle through the tank every 5000 miles. Car still runs well.
B00P2VLFK6|4|Great value, especially when you consider comes with two bulbs as well! The only two issues were ones I was already aware of from feedback on here, the clips for the side lights to screw into needs flipped around, and the bottom adjuster (with the long bar) on both stripped our right away, so needed to pull the old ones off the old lights. Took 5 minutes a light. Oh, and the nice part since my parking lot had no good surface for shining lights on for adjustment, I used the large box the four other boxes came in, put it about 15ft in front of van, used a sharpy to mark existing light, then put in new one and line it back up to old mark!  Would have been 5 star if I didn't have to swap out adjusters.
B00PU5I4JO|3|Helmet is VERY cool, everything fit on well and fits my head. I would not recommend you buy this for 100cc or higher due to the materials used,
B00CC0YR9Q|5|The quality of the product was great! The colo was true to the picture and the delivery was much faster than promised.
B00MGE5T04|5|very breathable and comfortable...
B001KNYOPI|2|Worked well but it took 3 co2 cartridges to take harley davidson front tire from 10 psi to 40 psi. This product did not specifically state how many it would take but other 16g cartridges advertised one cartridge to fill a tire. When you only have four cartridges, using three for one wheel is not enough security for the open road in my opinion.
B00BE6MWQE|3|Well made. Delivered on time. But too small for autos with larger headrests. For example, to cover the front of the headrest completely, the rear is not completed covered. Looks awkward. I wrote a note the seller about this but did not receive the courtesy of a reply (of any sort).
B001664MV0|5|on road ability really improved<br />quite easy to install with use of bushing tool<br /><br />note that you must keep the shell in place
B00681BFJU|5|All you need is included
B00MC72Q1K|5|I have tried a few different bulbs in reflector housings.  These, by far, look the best, fill up the whole housing and are also as bright (or maybe a little brighter) than incandescent bulbs.  Hats off to you JDM ASTAR bulbs!
B000XEGEWG|5|I haven't used these yet, but I'm sure I will like them.... Recommended by Jennifer McGuire to clean the MISTI.... that's why I purchased this 12-pack. Shared it with a friend, so we each have six! I'm sure they'll last awhile :)  UPDATED 9.27.15.... I finally got to use this cloth on my new MISTI..... love it... works well and exactly as intended!
B000CIU726|5|Absolutely top notch service. A minor problem with the order and they were all over it! I was completely satisfied! I highly recommend!
B00KBBL4H6|5|Works great high-quality would buy again no questions asked. It's the nicest tire gauge I've ever used
B00695ZAYG|4|Nice sticker, good quality overall, though starting to peel away at the edge.  maybe it wasn't meant for 100+ temps?<br />It was slightly more pastel in color than I was expecting, but I still like it.
B009DJSG9G|1|Does not fit
B00SAHO31M|5|product works great and looks great too . Very easy installation. Although after installation I did have to have head lights adjusted
B002OAT7NU|5|Looks good and works good when towing. Definitely keeps our towed vehicle cleaner and safer,
B003B3027E|5|Yes and it was received very good condition
B00651CLCS|2|Purchased because of the great reviews. After One year of use the antenna was just flopping around in the plastic base where the threads rusted and broke out of the base. This is on my 2014 Jeep Wrangler JK. This should have lasted years. Went back to the old Antenna until I can find a suitable replacement. Not worth purchasing again if I have to replace every year.
B00KGGTF9U|1|Did not Fit my 2008 Toyota Sienna at all. Was too small and terribly Flimsy. Not at all firm or of sturdy quality. Could not get it to stay in place. It Was like trying to  stand up a piece of paper. Very Disappointed and misleading by all the good reviews.
B00ESKE6JO|5|Fast service. Good price. Cute cat! Inside joke.. you'll see
B000CODPF6|4|work just fine, good price
B00KLIWHJI|5|Product came exactly as described. Everything works and fits great; I love the fact that it comes with the conversion dowels as well. I used a little bit of thread tape on the fittings and I have not had a single leak in almost a year of daily use on my B20/VTEC setup.
B00WVZ7UYG|5|looks good on car
B003NHLLY6|5|very happy with product
B001TXMOW4|4|Good quality set for the BMW.
B00NCPSSK4|5|Perfect fit and fast delivery
B000FUNZF2|5|Great product, fast shipping
B00B4EWTGY|4|looks good
B00TQ07IOQ|2|Hard to vacuum
B000IYWXNU|4|Very good
B002HTYRD8|5|Finally a cross to Mercury Quicksilver's expensive fuel pump! This one mounts on the belt driven Seawater Pump housing on my MCM 7.4L Bravo 1997. A direct fit, not painted black, and did not include a mounting gasket as pictured. Made by Airtex in USA so it can be trusted. Use a sealer on the ports when mounting the brass elbow fittings, and don't forget to drain and fill the eccentric cavity with High Perf. Gear Lube to the level port.<br />After many years of ethanol exposure I just didn't trust the old pump which was still running fine.
B0010GER4I|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B0006IX7YC|5|This is a must have for every travel trailer/5th wheel. Don't rely on those tablets they sell at the camping stores to get rid of odors and do a good &#34;cleaning&#34; job. This really gets toilet paper from all sides of the tank. We pull the outside hose through the a window as the inside faucets do not have the right nozzle connection. Don't be afraid to push the entire hose length into the toilet. We camp a lot! It's worth taking the extra couple minutes to use this tool. Especially wise to do before you store it for a season or long periods of time.
B004T5X1EE|5|great replacement for my worn out shifter boot!
B00G5DF0C4|5|A helluva swelluva trans fluid at a delightfully low price. Looks, smells, and tastes just like the big brand names. Just as slippery, too! Keeps your no hands trans happy and .might even work on your man bits! oh, baby
B00EVMT6A8|4|The 3M adhesive patch on the back is so strong it's difficult to remove the red polythene cover.<br /><br />Otherwise they seem to do the job as advertised.
B005J6YUY2|4|all ok
B001DKT0DO|5|Excellent!
B00QSNX4OW|5|Excellent easy to install
B00CP6IA3Q|3|ok
B009321FKK|5|I bought one 3 years ago It finally got weathered and tore. Had to buy another one same kind you really can't beat the price. They put a little buckle on the bottom instead of those hooks it's nice to just click em together instead of trying to hook up those hooks all the time.
B00062Z0VQ|5|I also have the cold intake on my 6.0 L truck. Unbelievable change in power & gas mileage. Great products!
B00MN963JS|5|Great for outdoors especially when fishing under the sun. Cheap and yet more buck for my money, The best to go out on the water with fully secured under the sun. Don't leave without. Typical for this outsied is 10 bucks. Why settle for ten bucks if you can get half of the price even not special price. Great product.
B00KHUQ6L0|4|Fit like a glove but does smell out of the package. It is ok now.
B00L24YHN4|5|Looks good and was easy to install. Recommended to everyone wanting a high quality and factory looking switch. This was my second switch from them and I'll be buying a third.
B00170MW8A|5|Fit my 98 Jeep Cherokee perfectly.
B005D7FQG8|5|Ordered wrong size and had no problem cancelling order
B00HYINUSA|5|This product works great just as advertized.
B000BQOVD0|5|Perfect replacement lamp. I hope they hold up. Half the price of local mower shop.
B003BZWR4S|4|Good tape for the price. However, part of the point was to leave minimal residue on surfaces. I taped a wire to the ceiling to route it, and there is now tape residue all along the ceiling, and the wire is disgusting (I threw it out because it was covered in sticky gunk). It works well for most applications, but if you don't want residue on surfaces after longer periods of time (~2 weeks), go with something else.
B001FCMS84|3|Its awesome once you get it on!<br /><br />A lot of work to attach and factory sent me two directly from them with dents and once with the wrong connecting pieces. Was easy enough customer service through the third parties to replace the first dented guard and get a new box of attachments but was a headache dealing with the need to even go through the issues.<br /><br />Just banged out the second dented guard.
B003WZX7UA|5|I haven't had a chance to use these yet but i have wanted something like this for a long time.
B00B2Q8NRS|5|Cute to make something out of it
B007HRJNIE|5|Works as advertized as it cuts down on the noise and squeaking considerably.
B001S8F2V0|5|Had a problem with my 04 chevy silverado 4.8l that the cold air will turn hot after a while. So I bought this and took off the mode door gear and replaced the driver side temp actuator, underneath the radio. There all the same actuators this is just cheaper. $$
B001GI0E10|5|Hard to find wheel bearing race on my old EZ Loader boat trailer.  Smaller than the standard size sold in bearing kits.
B00480KOP4|5|Good price modify into H11
B009F59HR8|5|Love it
B0015353XU|5|Has perfect pure sine wave. Runs our refrigeration compressor and Microwave on our boat.

B000GZQJIQ|5|exactly what we needed  shipped super fast
B0020YARMA|5|Great product
B0041CDPQO|5|I have this in my saddle bag of my motorcycle for use with my air pump and 12 V work light.  Works great and perfect length
B00FC22E00|3|This is like my 4th time buying these hids. One ballast always dies on me even with a harness.make no mistake the hids are really bright but 3 to 4 months no later I had to replace something.
986766180X|5|Look good and stay affixed.
B00N16RH3S|5|Good quality
B003BNJZFO|5|Perfect fit.  Back in business now!
B00WBL3328|5|Good product great service
B0039Z3SRA|5|work as directed and make it nice projecting all the sound forward in my boat instead of behind under all the seats etc.
B00MQ6WGJY|5|Fit just right.
B001DRNNKI|5|Fast. Will reorder.
B000AMBPAC|4|Actually worked for a while in order to get the problem fixed
B002CNARVK|5|Exactly what we needed for much less than through the dealer!
B0070Y37BI|4|Great product, good price. This fit my plates perfectly and added a sleek look to my truck. Definitely consider this product if you want to replace those horrible dealer frames! I recommend metal over plastic as all plastic will fade over time and this metal should last the life of your car and look good in the process.
B000CPHZUG|4|excellent makes vehicle look great
B009902Y4C|2|Bought this last year but I only used it twice and the Velcro on the back came off making it useless.
B004AG8TYO|5|compares to the OEM, works just fine, no more noise. 09 Jetta
B001DCF0XQ|5|Works and fits perfectly on my 2008 Mazda 3
B00V5Q10HU|5|Works perfectly.
B00VQTLGMK|1|Doesnt fit rite, stick out too far make the car look so ugly
B0002YQTJU|5|well made
B003FXWZT8|3|Bolts that come with it are kind of small other than that great product fast shipping
B000E4OHLK|5|Looks like the original. Easy to install. Fits perfect! The only issue was the delivery was slow.
B000HLFMTQ|5|It's a little smaller than I thought but it is good construction and easy to install. It will work for what I need.
B0091OE6K6|1|didn't work. they are suppose to snap and hold, snap and breathe and it unsnaps. don't buy!
B00L847KGE|5|Perfect fit in my 2002 Ranger .
B000M61KTC|5|Works!
B0067UFCB4|5|Good quality and price
B002P33KVQ|5|Great pump. Actually use it for a 12V portable misting systems when tail-gating and for this it works great. Mounted pump in a plastic box with in/out ports fitted for 3/4&#34; garden hose and a 12V disconnect w/ weatherproof switch. Normally you'd need a pressure tank to keep pump from constantly cycling to accommodate pressure but I found out by accident that one of these new 25' expanding hoses you see advertised on TV infomercials will perform this function at 1/10th of the cost. Hook-up to 12V from truck, insert hose in a 5 gallon water jug, connect to 10' portable misting line and, boom! I have a way to keep cool when tail-gating during preseason games (AZ Cardinals - it's REALLY hot here during pre-season games).<br />My use for this one aside, pump is so good I plan to buy another for my RV (the real intended use).
B00029JC94|5|Works great
B0028BVDRS|5|Good hitch. Very Sturdy
B00T4AK31S|5|I love these lights. I installed them on my open racecar trailer and wired them into the reverse light socket. They are very bright and have a wide range of light. I would have paid way more money.
B00VGMLOB0|5|Great quality and perfect fit. I would tell anyone needing replacement seats to buy this item. Could not have been more pleased with an item.
B00081PZ24|2|This hitch will fit a 118&#34; WB sprinter but will need significant modification including relocation of the spare tire and removal and re-welding of the exhaust hanger bracket.  Unfortunately, nothing in the documentation on Amazon says this so I just burned quite a bit of time figuring out that this hitch won't work for me.
B009FUF6DM|4|I got rid of paper towels years ago and had been using rags, the only problem being that they're not very absorbent. I own a couple &#34;premium&#34; microfiber clothes from the natural market which cost around $4 each. How do those compare to these 'amazon basics', which cost around $0.75, obviously the more expensive ones are fluffier, which makes them better for dusting, but they're not really more absorbent. When it comes to cleaning up spills or wiping things up, these basics do a really good job, and it was nice to throw away the rags. I have to say that a couple of them did have some black marks on them. But they will end up stained anyways in short time due to my cleaning with them. Overall, I thought they were a great value and I'm happy with them.
B00ZE5RGTY|5|At first I was skeptical about the catcher fitting but it was a perfect fit between the seats! I love the non slip mat because it can hold my phone up so it makes it easier when I'm using it as a GPS for directions
B008HKOYDO|5|My dad has difficulty with his grip now that he's getting older. He really enjoys using this &#34;suicide knob&#34;.  It's also nice that it folds unobtrusively out of the way when not in use.
B010OYOHO6|3|First time bought something like this.  They are ok. But I was disappointed  one of the earbuds came off but it went back on but i have a bit of static off and on.  The plastic piece which covers the port was loose and came off but it went back on too.  The headpiece is not adjustable. They did not include instructions si i was lucky i am pretty savy.
B00W9EBF0Y|4|So easy to set up and works great!  Thankfully, I no longer have to rely on my kids to tell me how much space I have left!
B0006IX85K|5|product works great
B00FB7Y472|5|These are nice pipes, great chrome finish.  When you put them on, make sure you get the clamp over the flared end of the muffler and secure it tightly to clamp onto the pipe.  I lost one tonight.  Must have spit it right out.  Now will order another pair.
B0096BH4ZI|3|Very expensive-made in China
B00ILXLMCS|4|as advertised
B000M5Y720|1|Does not fit 2007 chevy Silverado 1500 new body style low beams. Will work as high beams.
B008427CZ2|5|Good
B000JWI65A|4|Rear driver side hole was a chore. Lines up with support that runs through frame, making it a difficult point in install. Overall a great product!.
B00HETCKTY|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B0073MEQTO|5|Exactly as advertised. Great product.
B0037N40EY|1|Does not fit my 97 Tj

B006CS1FSA|4|worked fine
B00RTFVGZC|1|Can't detect an actually &#34;smell&#34;
B00AVZZZC2|5|Husband loved it!
B00E1ETJNU|5|Excellent quality
B001H1I40O|5|This fits my Lincoln MKX perfectly- I have no idea why there is a warning that says it does not on this.
B00OWS4TOO|5|Fit good easi to install
B0012FKF9S|5|Works perfect! Very Convinient.
B0086QCANU|5|as advertised
B00CPYFOVY|1|I recommend buying original Ford warrantied parts.  This one does not fit well enough to work.  In fact, with the old &#34;broken&#34; part I could at least open the door from the inside.  With this &#34;new&#34; part the door won't open at all.  Now I need to take it apart from inside the car with door closed.<br />Note that I did successfully repair the driver's side once, so I do know what I'm doing here.
B00FO67RYM|2|No information about how to install
B004HCOE8Q|5|This stuff is amazing I had a mirror on my bike with fine surface scratches on it and I used this and it removed the scratchers.
B005FN5VU6|4|these are great seat covers, great quality, a little tough to put on but nothing horrible. The only thing I dislike about the covers are the ties that hold the covers tight are not very sturdy. We went to pull the tie tight and it fully ripped from the base it was sewed to. Other than that they are great.
B000AA4RWM|4|works great and accurate. arrived on time and in good condition
B0059J6NTO|5|Good fit, comfortable and does what it's supposed to do. Great value in a fire retardant track shoe.
B000C9OC1M|4|Quality seems like it could be better. OEM looked tougher but so far so good
B006FRQZOW|5|good
B00KSY3HFS|5|Good shade
B00Q9ESX7S|5|Wiring worked great and was simple. There was a flaw in design somewhere in the wiring which caused me an issue. They were super fast with a response and made it right! Very impressed with their service! You can't go wrong, thank you!
B001NOU92G|1|An absolute piece of crap that I returned. Machining and finishing is worse than a $15 HF purple gun. The one I ordered arrive with an air cap that was cut through in manufacturing. This should never have left the factory. Buy the HF guy instead and you'll be better off.
B00CPYFOW8|1|I got the part in & it sort of works, but is so hard to open that I can tell it's not catching correctly & won't last.  I suggest buying original Ford warrantied parts.
B007KFMF1U|5|Worked great on my SS impala got rid of the scraping sounds!
B008MNDPPY|5|Fine product
B00DUJRLWS|3|Cheap looking but serves it purpose.
B00KTIXMHQ|5|Easy swap out and good quality
B00ECXT30O|4|As described. Tiny bits of the decal wouldn't come off the back, but you can't tell. Overall it looks good.
B007VIGCJW|3|worked but not super good
B00BLYLEEA|5|Fits perfectly. Good quality.
B009656SQA|1|Lasted 9 months.
B00HMGCIP0|5|Strut mounts arrived fast and were a perfect fit on my A4.
B002E571UQ|5|Its been 4 months since I installed this Ignition lock in my 2001 Toyota camry. I could easily install it myself though I don't have much knowledge of car hardware. This perfectly fixed in my car. Amazon has offered best price as far as my research while buying this product. Considering the price and quality, I definitely recommend this product for others.
B001GJ3FIS|2|This broke after about a month of use. I bought a new one at Walmart for 11 bucks and what a difference. I wish I had gone to Walmart to begin with, and I hate walmart.
B00FFMK17U|4|Easy to install as stated in other reviews,, just bought new 2015 C. ,, Thought the price was high, but with free shipping, and the protection of the bumper (I keep my cars for years), and a perfect fit it was worth it
B00H1JCXGC|5|Check engine light was throwing a code about the intake runner manifold position switch on our '08 Avenger.  Got this in two days and installed very easily (removed main air intake hose and then the three bolts that hold unit on). After about 30 miles the engine light shut off and has not returned for over 300 miles now. I expect the little gears in this small motor just got stripped over time as a small whine could be heard from the old one before replacing (turn key all the way to on without starting and go under the hood and listen quietly).  Same exact part that came off the car, so not a cheap aftermarket part. I would recommend trying this fix if you have the same issue.
B005FKXTEY|5|Good product
B003TQB5TC|1|This product didn't turn out to eat I thought it would while spraying my car the paint gets my gun jammed up n have to clean gun every time I refill my gun
B000C57UHO|5|bought these for 96 dodge ram 1500 and they ride better then the stock springs that on on the truck. they did add a little extra hieght to he front almost brought it to a level ride height with the back of the truck (96 dodge ram 1500 EXT cab 6.5ft bed)
B000EQFTD8|5|I purchased these headlight bulbs in December of 2011 from Amazon for my 2011 F-150.  They are a huge improvement over the stock Halogen headlights and I highly recommend these bulbs.  I'm still using the bulbs I installed in my truck in 12/2011 and have been (I'm sure that I'll get one go out shortly for writing this review) great since installing them.  I purchased the truck new in Nov. 2011, and it now has about 45k miles on it.<br /><br />I strongly recommend these bulbs to replace the cheap factory halogen bulbs.
B000M6TWQK|5|I bought this to use on the Saddle Sore 1K. So glad I got it. Very comfortable.
B007HSN7KI|5|Excellent quality and fit. Much thicker material and better fit than what I purchased from Weather Tech for my Land Rover. Too bad Husky don't make them for Land Rovers.
B003XGYDE2|1|I purchased this unit in March 2015, used it one time to put air in a trailer tie.  The pump seemed to work okay, albeit VERY slowly.  The 2nd attempt at using the pump for the exact same thing came mid July, this time in the middle of trying to inflate my trailer tire, the noise of the pump increase dramatically as-if a baffle or valve failed and it started vibrating more violently.  Well the pump stopped pumping air at this point.  Of course the Amazon return/exchange policy has long since passed so I need to go through the hassle of trying to get a replacement.<br /><br />Although the pump looks very industrious, it is clearly a cheap Chinese made product and I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable pump to own long-term.
B00SZK212M|1|Does not fit 2007 Chevy Silverado 1500 new body style fog light harness. Could work as high beam replacement if you want really dim high beams.
B00KTIW7SQ|1|Item requires professional programming by a car dealership or automobile locksmith
B000EDUTX6|5|Great product, we very seldom use stove inside and use the grill outside and this gives a lot more counter space. It stays in place , was easy to figure out were to put rubber mounts to hold in place.
B0007VCL2W|2|his model number did not fit a 1989 bronco 2, returned it.
B00MATVMC4|1|It's pretty useless. It holds gas perfectly fine. As for filling up your vehicle with it, it's a pain in the ass. I literally only got two gallons out of it in about 15-20 minutes of use. It would be much more useful if it had a breather hole to allow quicker transfer. I'd rather not even use it with how long it take to drain. A man with prostate problems could drain their bladder faster than this thing.
B00CHXBBTW|1|Ordered this for our RV. When it came there was no 50 Amp twist lock on the cord like the description says. It us just the 4 conductors. I returned this cord.
B00125XK4U|5|Once you get them cut to the proper length they work very well.
B00P5YQWXU|3|Cheap replacements but only fits 9-3. 9-5s are usually 63-65mm
B00OFU33PU|5|helped organize my van trunk. Material; thin so don't expect to use as bags
B004BH76V4|5|Fits perfectly and really reduces the heat inside the car.
B003066NKC|5|Looks awesome.  Easy installation.
B00P5YLRJE|2|great/ just order the wrong item
B00P1935R0|5|good quality.  i put a thin layer of RTV on the felt gasket.  felt filter which is what i needed to trap all the silt and particles.  plus i dropped a very strong magnet in the pan to make sure all the particulates get trapped.  still hasn't leaked a drop like a cork gasket does.
B000GZQNBO|4|It met my expectations.
B006FQXO4C|1|Fell apart first time I used it. You have to use the guts out of your old fob. Didnt fit correectly when putting back together
B000MK9LEO|5|Works great!!
B009VUAD66|3|Does not fit 2003 Ford Escape instrument cluster. Took out the bulb and use existing base. 3 stars for bulb fits the original base!
B0031HEIDY|5|Fit my 2006 Honda Accord perfectly!  Thanks!
B007XXDWMU|5|Item was received quickly and just how it was described.  Thank you.
B001RBQF4G|5|Never used it. But looks like it would work great
B0023VE0O6|5|Arrived fast and completely matched!
B003NBFKDK|3|We bought this for a recent trip and overall it's a good product. However, the assembly instructions are not clear at all. Also, we had to use a 1 1/4&#34; to 2&#34; hitch adapter that left the cargo rack sticking out quite far from the bumper, leaving it rather unstable. We were able to fix this by using tie down straps and hooking them to the frame of the car. For the money it's a pretty nice cargo rack but given the opportunity I would probably have chosen something a little more sturdy.
B002BHX1X8|5|Use it everyday in our automotive shop when replacing car batteries in cars to prevent loss of radio stations and security lockouts. Great product, we now own 2 because they work great
B00C25GRI0|4|Installation was fairly easy, programming the &#34;chip&#34; is a pain.  If you get it wrong, the theft light stays on.
B000NOOQIU|4|You should periodically inspect and replace these 'bowls' as they can corrode and leak gas into the engine compartment.  Nice to have a change of filters at the same time.  It was hard getting the originals off, but I used a strap wrench instead of the special tool they make for these.  The old ones had been on for YEARS.
B00KYK9Y80|5|Good quality T-shirt.
B00KSW6EOG|5|Bought these for my retired combat vet. He really likes them. Arrived quickly. Great price. Hope marine corps logo doesn't peel off.
B004NW00P6|5|Sturdy and great value.
B003TY6WJC|5|Son loves it.  As expected.
B005N53AM2|3|Item arrived on time and looks and feel nice. But....I have a standard steering wheel and for the life of me, I could NOT get it stretched enough to put it on.  I left it in the hot sun for several hours, on multiple occasions to soften it up, but nothing.  I'm giving it away instead, maybe someone else can make it fit their wheel.
B008HZO7YK|1|Only one connection cable included, should be two.
B008W1O1KO|1|poor quality
B000B61TP8|5|Perfect fit! Fit right under our camper and served it's purpose!
B007EEWV1G|5|I won a 2011 civic si ASM is the color this wrap is surprisingly very close to my factory color just a shade lighter. The material is stretchy and easy to work with, just be careful not to stretch it too much because it will distort the color.
B00Q71KUVK|5|It fit
B00NXRX8RY|5|Great quality
B00I8U0G6C|2|They were suppose to strink but they didn't by much and so I ended up having to cut them and it looks choppy because of it .
B00E0FR0RM|4|does what it says.
B00GSPT4HG|5|Love it.
B0043QWVOK|4|Worked perfectly in the application recommended for, I just wish they would have informed me this was required for the application when I originally ordered the fumoto valve it is used with.
B00FLFX1QO|5|for $6 it's a must have to keep the radiator still.
B00U2COE7G|1|Very disappointed ... great concept but the quality isn't there...the plastic is very distorted ....like looking through someone<br />else's prescription glasses.
B000F19302|5|The dashmat is just what I was looking for, fit my truck like a glove.  would buy one again!!!
B001DKSVB6|4|Replaced original part in my 1998 Ford F-150 4.6L V8. This was an easy install, and took less than 10 minutes. I replaced this part while trying to solve multiple error codes for my engine.
B008FQRQBM|5|Great addition to the Curve, easy to install. I personally think it should come with the toilet, but hey...
B00W2DKPEE|1|This is at all not what I bought. Here, the picture shows the black double-headed eagle with a white outline. What I received was a small red Albanian flag STICKER. It's not even a bumper sticker or decal....just a regular sticker.
B00E1SLZ74|5|Excellent
B0083LHN7Q|5|We love this rug, we have a solare and the rug matches so well, it should come with the trailer 😉
B00VQTLGMK|2|This product doesn't really fit well on the 2015 IS F sport. Sticks out to far.
B0029TQDLA|5|Exactly what I needed. Thank you.
B002UC2UB8|5|great product, works as described, came before was promised, feel lots safer plugging brand new 5th wheel to old rv park services, would buy again
B001C6JCBO|5|Perfect fit for my F350.  Just some suggestions I have.  Get 4 1/2&#34; x 1&#34; long grade 8 bolts to replace the ones in the kit.  They seem a little small.  You may want to have a replacement spring bolt ready as well.  It is likely worn out.  Also, the original spring hanger is riveted in, so you will need to grind or torch the old one off.
B00JINPJD8|5|very good idea.  why didn't i think of it?
B000C39C6I|5|Easy to install, worked the first time.
B00EG8MBBS|5|Works REALLY WELL. I modified my mini bike and this brake is able to safely stop me (150+ lbs) and the bike with a new engine (80+ lbs) from 60 mph WITH NO MODIFICATIONS. If you tune it properly you can prevent the rear wheel from locking up while still retaining the necessary stopping power.
B00ECFGCII|1|Keep in mind, Leaders RPM charges a 10% restocking fee on returned merchandise.  I bought this and returned it unopened.  It was shocking to see the 10% charge.
B003XGYDE2|5|Thank you. It is a very good product.
B0009JKI7W|1|These have worked well for me in the past but the 21&#34; and 19&#34; blades I ordered in July 2015 worked terribly.  Not only do they fail to adequately move water off my windshield but they also make noise.
B0073VLTKO|1|most leaked out of bottle and dryed . just go to advanced auto
B0065G36WW|5|Great chain. Put 2000 miles on it still has not stretched!  : )
B00A82A3QG|5|Fixed problem 100%
B00X1E8WMU|5|Absolutely great product.  Easily compared to similar products for twice the price.  Great quality!
B004NKYJ9G|5|AWESOME products will continue to buy
B00RYPN0SI|5|I used them right away and the spoons worked very well on a very difficult motorcycle tire. A friend commented on the spoons in a very positive way.
B00B7GC50Y|5|Excellent quality. Everything you could possibly need it with it.It is waterproof. I'm a do-it-yourselfer & a gadget lover. Wish I had more projects for this.
B00CJI1WF8|5|Fast delivery and worked perfectly.
B00EOAXKJU|5|Perfect!
B00L842SKW|1|2 months after installing these the lenses started to separate from the housing. Have emailed the company several times and have not heard anything back, even left my phone number and nothing. This product and company is a big FAIL
B00WGZJ7VU|5|I was worried to buy after market cab lights for my Dodge 3500 because of everyone saying if its not oem, its going to leak basically. I took the risk and when we went to install them, these cab lights actually had way better and bigger seals then my stock dodge ones had. I did several leak tests with the hose to see if I need to seal them with sealant just in case too before fall comes around and no leaks were found what so ever! They were easy to install and I get lots of compliments on them. They look really good on my white truck vs the yellow lenses.
B0041TOQ92|5|Exactly what was needed and a very good price.
B001KSEJBW|5|A+
B000I04Z7Q|5|Brilliant purchase. Thanks!
B00K2958O2|5|So cool!
B00V30J86I|5|This is a great little product for keeping the space between the front seats useful and separate from the back. I own a Chevy suburban and this little product works really well in the space between the front seats.
B000IE0F12|4|Hope it works when I need it.
B009EACZF0|5|Alamo
B004LGJAE6|5|worked great did increase throttle response on my civic 233,000 on it and still going
B000AMLWPK|5|I have received many compliments on Hula Flops Hitch Cover.
B004GCU3OG|1|This did NOT come with the cap that is listed as paint to match. I wasted money buying this when I could have bought the OEM version with the cap. Now between what I paid for the mirror assembly sans cap, what I will pay for the cap, and the cost of the paint.... It was really not worth it.
B00XZ9PLQG|5|Took the key to the locksmith and the key works just perfect thanks
B007F2I13E|1|It broke the first day on my car.
B00D618O7Q|5|Best purchase I've ever made for my car! Wanted a sleek looking window deflector to go on my black Honda Civic. These exceeded my expectations.....even from Weather Tech! Snaps into track of window, no stick on junk. Low profile, fits perfectly, works and looks great! Took all of 5 minutes to put all 4 on. Designed in the USA and made in Germany= PERFECTION. Can't go wrong with Weather Tech! Spend the extra money for these instead of buying the cheapos from the auto parts store, you won't regret it!
B006BMDQHK|4|this is what I usually buy for the company's 2 cycle engines - seems to work pretty well.
B00LV8PAPU|2|Size chart is correct,and take the advice and order one size bigger what you ussualy wear. Jacket is shorter size,but that's how is design. Its is heavy duty,but the leather is NOT REAL,artificial leather. Seller should change information about material, because its not leather.
B002RSIK4G|5|Use took about two hours including cleaning and prep.  I installed two rolls.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|very well made & great fit
B00030DLEE|5|Worked great to heat up pre made meals while camping at a music festival.  We even heated some frozen breakfast meals, took about 45 minutes but did the job.
B00N70RSEG|5|just what I expected . delivery on time, works great
B00Y3OJ6FE|4|very cute..
B0044UQAKQ|5|This size is great for traveling.  Never leave a smelly bathroom in a public place.
B00YML13OU|5|Our daughter feels more comfortable driving when people are aware that she is just learning.
B000BPLNPU|5|I put this in my BMW F650GS and it goes thump thump just like it did before. I'm happy to find this sparkplug here at this price.
B002OUVL6G|5|Using for our camper to protect electrical
B00JG5NATS|2|the vacuum started leaking oil the second week
B0029V9DRY|4|Drove over 3000 miles in rain and shine. Held up great. It is now safely stored in my garage, as it will be used again.
B000BUTDCA|5|Absolute must- have for your RV.  Good quality.  Handles are nice to have.
B000C59KN6|2|Just a HEADS UP:  THESE SHOCKS DO NOT FIT 2004 CHEVY SILVERADO 1500 2WD. Check the list very closely before ordering to be sure it fits your truck (It's probably my fault as I didn't notice if the check list said 4WD or 2WD...could've been a late night) The bottom mount is not correct for 2WD. My truck is 2WD...these shock must be for 4x4's only....  Too bad I didn't find out until spending an hour in the heat removing the wheel and old shock....then had to re-assemble everything so I could drive the truck until ordering the correct new shocks.  Amazon says they can not be returned because it is past 30 days since I ordered them...but very nice lady Francheska D. worked with me and sent me a UPS return label and will credit my account for most of the cost of the shocks.   I am fine with that.  In the future, I'll make sure I get around to doing something before the 30 day return grace period is up.
B0070Y34IE|5|perfect
B00JRFQ6JS|5|awesome works well
B00927ER9M|5|Hooked up easy  works great
B005SNMQJ2|5|I love it, its fully transparent to it doesn't change the color of my gas tank, and the rubber quality is perfect. Just make sure to apply enough heat with a hairdryer or a heat gun so It sticks correctly to your tank, otherwise the borders may come off.
B000O0P768|1|Part was not correct. Seller stuck sticker with correct part number on package.
B007Y2SIGK|1|Took some time to install. Stopped working after 8 months. Went to U-Haul and installed their store brand wiring kit, paid extra for insurance and will be replaced if it ever fails.
B002OOY26S|5|Fits very nicely as long you know your size. Very nice looking helmet and it is very comfortable. It is DOT approved and is an all around perfect helmet
B00AJZFI44|5|High value and quality
B0027FYC00|3|Spray doors disguise the cigar when u spray it on yourself. 3 stars due to the little bit of spray you get for the money. The can should be able to hold more than 1oz.
B0062TQ8FY|5|Perfect
B00TEG3KFI|4|looks good!
B00D3941HS|5|Exactly what we needed.  Nice heavy duty quality.  Well packaged
B007772I54|5|Works perfectly with the propane gas tank and cover I purchased.
B000A8JLO8|5|No problems with this order.No problems with this order.
B00RK6KNFE|5|this is perfect. Exactly what i was looking for. Has a nice slot for things you want to stay put and keeps groceries and everything else from rolling out when the lift gate opens.
B001OMVCN2|1|Very expensive and poorly designed....I didn't even get it installed before it broke air valve nipple broke off when making quick connect. expecting something more durable for the price..
B00W6J19EY|5|came on date was supposed to, looks great, very easy to minstall, great price compared to others, would buy again
B00AM3HV3Y|5|Fit perfectly. Only problem is now I want to replace all the lenses. Seriously easy. Anyone could do it.
B00QSC1ES6|5|great quality
B00MJ3ZZ24|5|these are the perfect price and are a great fit on my Accord . In perfect condition and work great !
B001VZN6ZO|5|Does the job for a little more performance.
B005DZ3QDA|4|I'm only docking it one star because I think they should remove the velcro strap from this as it poses a great risk to damaging your VW roller shade if you happen to not mount this correctly (with the strap out of the way).  If you all the velcro strap to get sucked back into the sun shade roller prepare for a massive repair bill to repair it....so be ultra careful not to allow this to happen.  Next time I remove this shade from my VW I'm going to cut the velcro strap off so there is zero risk of damage.<br /><br />Other than that this thing is AWESOME!!  I was going to buy materials from Home Depot to make one myself and came across this in my research and it was CHEAPER than a DIY project and much better made that DIY would have been.  Awesome produce!  Just be careful of the velcro strap placement and you'll love it.
B00230BP7C|5|Normally, we use Red Line 2 Racing 2 Stroke, but for chainsaws and other consumer 2 strokes, this product is more than adequate.
B004N63S9W|3|Works great, but I didn't like the smell. Giving it to a young man friend. Perhaps he won't mind it. Very personal preference. I'm very picky. Most would probably not be bothered.
B004XNDETY|4|Adding this product to ever tank of your fuel is smart business and good sense.
B0041TS6UM|2|Quality.<br /> Soso
B00ET6V2KI|5|Parts fit perfectly. Here's a YouTube Video on how to change your differential fluid and the usage of these washers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRToCHIs_T8
B00PWG6AC4|4|Good service from amazon.  The shades are large enough to stay in the windshield easily, but are a little tricky to fold up once the are warm.  And they do get warm in Houston.
B007KPRN2G|5|I like this for my Harley Davidson,  feel good going down the highway,  fit great.
B000A6Z964|5|Great price
B0007RS4BI|5|GREAT
B000CNBCF2|4|Installed in 2005 Expedition by placing the the front end in first, then bend slightly to insert the back end... then insert the rest by inserting - starting from the front - until you reach the top flat portion. Then bend enough to finish the top section. (So there is two times you need to bend it.) Takes less than 5 minutes to install and seems sturdy.<br /><br />The back section uses tape even though it is 'in-channel'. The rear window seems to have a bit more trouble closing and you'll notice a slight bump when it reaches the plastic of these deflectors, although you wouldn't notice unless you look for it.<br /><br />The windows seem to close tightly, although you can put your palm on the inside and outside of your window and push up to snuggly close the window since there seems to be a quarter inch that the window cannot close because of the added material.
B00HWINB7M|4|they work great pushing and tighting prongs<br />on rings,
B006FUT05U|5|This stuff delivers! Took 15 minutes to wax my black Explorer... would go even faster if you had two people working in tandem; one waxer, one wiper. I used the [[ASIN:B0009IQZH0 Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber Towels (Pack of 3)]] for the application and buffing. Spray it on, spread it around (you'll see the surface turn cloudy), then buff if off. The result is a wet, mirror-like finish. The other cool thing is that any over-spray doesn't leave white residue on your trim and other plastic elements.<br /><br />It is my understanding that the spray-type waxes don't last as long as a traditional paste job. That's fine... at this price -- and the speed in which you can apply it -- I won't mind doing this every month or so.
B00JAYO5WQ|4|Got these for a 2000 Chevy s10 for the front turn signals. They look and work good. had lots of comments on them. We already had load resisters for other LED lights on the line so we didn't have to put anymore in. But if you don't have any LED's already on your vehicle you will need load resisters. Something like [[ASIN:B00L4V9ECY 4Pcs Aaron 50W 6ohm Load Resistors - Fix LED Bulb Fast Hyper Flash Turn Signal Blink Error Code]]. However i have had better results using motorcycle load resisters that are version 2 and waterproof. The ones for motorcycles tend to be made for smaller spaces and have better heat dissipation.
B003SZ71ZQ|5|Perfect for on a 01 protege
B00LNNR9GG|3|Not as bright as i would have hopes, but they get the job done.
B00Q6ISG4M|1|The item is not as pictured and flares out near the end, making it functional for jack stands but unusable for the crank fitting to raise and lower pop-up camper roof
B00KTIUG5C|5|great deal for the money  easy to program  works great
B004HLSHQW|5|Good product. Fair Price.
B00OA66IAG|1|On the very first use the handle started to come loose. I turned the handle to tighten, but it was still loose. On the second wash, the handle came completely off and would not screw back on. The bristles are coarse and rough. Very poor example of a &#34;concours&#34; wheel brush. A definite DO NOT BUY !  I would give this a no star rating, but that's not available.
B00I4DG4R8|4|Like the sticker. have not put it on car yet
B00BQN5OX8|1|Too long & wouldn't fit. Had to go to Auto Zone for nearly twicw the money.
B005M1RI84|5|Excellent deal on the leader in thread lock.
B00H8KWN14|5|They work great !
B000WK4EC8|4|Good stuff, but expensive, and requires a great deal of rinsing, as stated on the instructions. I use it to get in all the tiny hidden places you can never reach.
B00OPAP08S|5|Eliminated my sloppy steering from the stock rag joint on my 1990 Silverado.  Had to cut it down quite a lot but it still worked great.
