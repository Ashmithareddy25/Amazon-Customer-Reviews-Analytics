B0002RGNRU|1.0|I love this movie, I've seen it before, it's one of my favorites but the DVD I bought is for Region 2 (NOT US) could have make it a little more clear that this won't play in my DVD player.  Thanks a lot.
0553801473|2.0|I'm beginning this \\"review\\"(although it is more accurately a letter of complaint) before I've finished the book. At this point I'm 62 chapters in, and 81% done, and I'm sick to death of it. I'm struggling to finish, and I never not finish books. The only book I ever didn't finish in disgust was the first Wraethlu book and this is nearly as bad as that. I don't ever remember waiting this long for a book and being so disappointed. Even the Deathly Hallows didn't disappoint me as much as this, and that--if you'll remember my horror at that book--is saying something.<br /><br />I have now finished and while the book took a minor turn for the better it soon plummeted back into \\"disappointing.\\"<br />The main problem to me is that it's bloated beyond control. I can't blame the editors for this, because I understand they had very little time to manage a monster of a book and it had already been cut down by about a third, apparently, but there's so much padding it suffocates under its own weight, like Lord Manderley falling asleep on his wife, or something.<br /><br />Plus I would suspect that the editors worked on an arc, or a pov, and didn't see the book as a whole--but even if that was the case, there's no excuse for the repetition and rehashing Facts are repeated within the same POV - we are told a dozen (maybe two dozen) times how Tyrion killed his father and Shae, as if we'd forgotten, not only since reading the book where that happened, but since reading Tyrion's previous chapter. We are reminded, over and over and over and in fact, over, who is leal to Winterfell and who has turned their cloak and who are enemies--so many times that I just wanted to scream. Even Asha, who in previous books knows nothing of the grass-soft lords and their history, suddenly seems an expert and we are reminded YET AGAIN what the position is regarding the Karstarks.<br /><br />Every time we see Davos (and as much as I like Davos as a character I was glad we didn't see him more than we did or I would have given up reading altogether) we are reminded over and over (and indeed, over) and over again that he had seven sons and he's lost four and about his fingers.and every single thing else we've ever learned about this insignificant character. It's not as if this fact is pigging relevant. Then, when we are invested with all this time with Davos, he's dropped and we don't see where he goes, who he's with, blah de blah de blah. He's a deus ex machina, simply there to show plot points as they move on.<br /><br />So many chapters are not only rehashing, \\"as you know, Bob\\" narration and dialogue, but are entirely unnecessary. It seems that GRRM thought \\"well, x person has got to get to x place so I'd better show the journey.\\" And the actual journeys are pointless.<br /><br />Seriously. Tyrion's entire story of hundreds of pages could have started \\"Tyrion woke up and found he didn't like being a slave.\\" Yes,there was one vital character he met on his travels, but his interaction with him was inconsequential and we did need the whole journey and the turtles. Ditto for Quentyn's journey. Ditto for Victarian's journey.<br /><br />This is a classic example of his padding (in miniature)<br /><br />\\"the sky above Meereen was the colour of corpse flesh, dull and white and heavy, a mass of unbroken cloud from horizon to horizon. The sun was hidden behind a wall of cloud. it would set unseen, as it had risen unseen that morning.\\"<br /><br />You see what I mean. We've had a literary description of the wall of cloud in teh sky, then for people who don't quite get it, we get \\"it's cloudy\\" Then for the complete thickos we are told what the consequence of this will be.<br /><br />I am not judging the book on this one section, merely holding it up as a classic example of GRRM taking two or three ways to say the same thing. I have been tweeting over and over that \\"nothing has happened yet\\" and while that's not entirely true, it certainly felt like it--probably due to the over-weighted and bloated chapters that are nothing more than description and travelogue and internal (repetitious) dialogue and angsting and telling us crap we already know and listing everyone in the scene and every merchant and every turtle and every type of food and every mercenary<br /><br />I have learned that - if you can take out a scene, or a chapter entirely and it makes no difference at all to the plot--then that scene is entirely irrelevant and should--must--be excised. Now, of course, I don't know GRRMS plan, it might be that there's a very good reason he left all the boring tripe in, but it didn't help to make this the kind of book that the first 3 were.<br /><br />The problem with the chapters that are (probably) essential is everyone's so bloody PASSIVE. There's a reason Jon is, so that didn't bother me, but what the hell happened to Dany and Tyrion? Did they both have lobotomies somewhere between books 4 and 5? Dany has gone down with a case of Tonks-itis. (Tonks, from Harry Potter was a smart, feisty auror -that alone meant she was in the top 3percent of her class--who rocked in the fighting department.She was clever, witty and amusing. Then in later books she fell in lurve, lost her powers, became nothing more than a weepy clinging woman and consequently died. Even when we see Ghost!Remus later on, she's not with him.) And Dany has gone the same way. She won a Horse Lord's heart, and his followers, and thousands of poorfolk's hearts, then turns into nothing more than a girl in love led by men.<br /><br />Love doesn't do well in this series,as a matter of course. Of course I know that the good side doesn't always win, but sheesh - sometimes they do. But there's no character here who falls in love who gets a fair deal. In fact, GRRM goes so far to list a whole heap of people who married for love and allthe appalling things that happened to them. (that's on top of the main characters who married for love and died horribly. Cat/Ned, Lysa, Dany/Drogo, Tyrion/Tysha and the others who loved without marriage and died horribly... Add to that the sudden homophobia from all corners,when it had been much more accepted before. No, love doesn't do well.<br /><br />LISTs: What was the point of all the lists? Naming every hostage that came through the wall? All the irritating hostages at irritating Meereen (is there a point to Meereen?) All with too many Zs in their names.<br /><br />There were (a paltry few) chapters I liked. Perhaps ten out of 70 PLUS.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|This is my first 5 star grade for a product and it's well deserved. I ran headphones through about 100 hrs of break-in with pink noise and music.   I am not expert but can say that the sound is exactly what i wanted - absolutely transparent reproduction of the source as crisp and clean as it can be. no artificial flavor, no effort to make it \\"warmer\\", \\"colder\\" or \\"bassier\\", just the detailed reproduction of the music. I listen to 24-bit flacs of mostly classical and jazz music and can't be happier with the headphones.   Personally i also find them very comfortable, my ears (regular size) fit well inside, no extra pressure, reasonably natural feeling wearing them, have done it for hours.  Of course open-air headphones have its challenges with outside noise but it's not specific to this model.  Recommend to everybody looking for the same qualities as I did.

1572814748|5.0|I LOVE this deck!! The size is absolutely PERFECT!! It's not like the mini decks you get in other pocket editions. These are very similar to the size of a deck of playing cards. I like the imagery a LOT. It's bold enough to see all of the symbolism but not overly bright. The little box it comes in is AWESOME for storage as well as carrying it around from place to place. I have to say that I have only done a handful of readings with it BUT...It has been so accurate and SPOT on with the advice! I feel very connected and that is the most important thing! This is my new FAVORITE deck!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is filled with so much drama, jealousy, passion, sexy characters, brutal fightings, and tenderness! It's like I was in college again and knew these people!   Travis is one of the main characters and this author made ME want to sleep with him! Omg..the little obsessive control freak with tattoos, muscles and DON'T piss him off by checking out his lady or he'll kick the crap outta ya. Oh yeah.   Not only does this author hit the target with him and his girlfriend but I honestly have to say the whole book was really good. I laughed and rolled my eyes and got a little pissed but that only happens when the book is written well!

0786838655|5.0|If you like books filled with adventure and Greek mythology, you have to read The Lightning Thief.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a twelve years old boy who has been expelled from a couple of schools and can't concentrate. Everybody thinks he's a failure, except his mother. So it isn't exactly surprising that he has only one friend and his school and a teacher hates him. What he wasn't expecting was that her teacher became a monster and tried to kill him.<br /><br />Nobody seems to remind that little detail, but he's sure he isn't crazy. But Percy's past is full of secrets, and his mother has tried to protect him until now.<br /><br />Percy's voices trapped me from the beginning. He's young, but extremely fun and mature, and innocent. When he discovers he's a demigod, things starts to get complicated. First, nobody knows who is his father and now he's being accused of stealing Zeus lightning bolt.<br /><br />That's why he, and his friends Grover and Annabeth decides to discovers who is the real thief and that way stop a war between gods. But of course, the Gods have never been very fair and some of them wants Percy to be guilty.<br /><br />Their journey is so much fun. Full of adventures and dangers, there were always twists that managed to surprise me.<br /><br />The writing is simple and with Percy's voice, I read it very quickly. It was never boring or too intense, and I always wanted to read more.<br /><br />Overall, The Lightning Thief is a story with Greek mythology interlaced with the modern world that I loved, and I regret I didn't read it when I was younger. I'm definitely going to read more of the Percy Jackson's books, I believe it's going to be one of my favorite series!

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I purchased this microphone to use with video blogging.  The only way I could hear the signal was to boost it at least 20db.  When you do that, there's too much \\"air\\" sound in the background.  It uses a small, LR44 battery and has an on/off switch.  I tried replacing the battery.  I ensured I was putting it in correctly (you can put it in upside down).  I verified that I was using the correct input on the computer and on the voice recorder.  I really like AudioTechnica, but I feel that they either need to pull this product or have better QA.    I read other reviews and it seems to be a good mic for others.  I did notice one reviewer who said to be careful it wasn't manufactured in the Philippines.  Mine was, so I asked Amazon for an exchange which they gladly did and did quickly.  When I received the replacement, it had the same super quiet signal.  Not surprisingly, it was also manufactured in the Philippines.  I'm not sure if this is coincidence or not, but I will now be looking for an alternate manufacturer to replace the AudioTechnica lavalier mic.  I have already asked Amazon for a refund.  I recommend that you pass on this mic.

Must say I enjoyed parts of it but was dissapointed that they used so much violence in cars 2 no need for that cars one was an exelent story with mild country town justus .but cars 2 is full of war style violence and I found my 3 year old lost interest a few times and asked in a concerned voice on more than one occassion why are they doing that and why is Matter dieing etc;Where as with cars 1 he can still watch the entire film without taking his eye's off the screen and has no problem comprehending the story at all.I would not race out and buy the movie like I have with all the other Pixar hit's in the past;Reason being that I don't wish my kids to be influenced by this kind of war like violence in what should have been a more peace loving movie like cars 1 and aimed at the family setting involing a child based ordiance .but somhow they lost sight of this and bough out the guns what a shame.
0307595862|5.0|In the author's previous books, altho I like his detective, Harry Hole, I found it laughable that he had such easy success with women, and that made the books seem less believable, as well as his typical-of-detective novels self-dislike and drinking. Well, it may be a bit overdone in most books, but cops do not have peaceful home lives, by and large, so I did not find that to be distracting, and wouldn't blame the author for using a well-documented convention of the genre and the life, as he does by having Harry lose his love. This book, the story swept me up and I didn't even have a chance to wonder if it was believable. Chilling image of the snowman in the front yard of the victim, wearing her scarf, found by her son... Right away, my gut clenched and I went along for the ride.<br /><br />This is a satisfying detective novel, with a broader scope than some (check out Redbreast, also broad in scope). It has twists and turns, and is not easy to second-guess. What would be the fun in that? As I read, the temperature topped 100 degrees, so snowy Scandinavia was perfect summer reading in NY.
0439023513|2.0|\\"Mocking Jay\\" by Suzanne Collins, was long-anticipated by me, and ultimately the most difficult of the trilogy for me to read.  Plot Spoilers  I enjoyed reading \\"Hunger Games\\" despite my 2 great reservations about such a book.  Throughout Book 1 and the series, I did not buy into the concept of a sort of Roman ampitheatre games.  It seems to me personally (and I don't expect others to agree with me) that:  i) sacrificing children and teens by adults is a bit of a cheap exploit sometimes used by writers (I didn't enjoy the concept in \\"His Dark Materials\\" by Philip Pullman either).    ii) getting characters to kill others as a form of survival is a dark and potentially-unenjoyable plot device. Not even that original as it turns out.  The plot twists at the denouement of \\"Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\" made them memorable. The humanity, compassion and rebelliousness of Katniss, Peeta, Gale and the wide cast of characters is what kept me going to the end.  However, unfortunately, I found the key ingredients of a humane and an adversarial element missing in Book #3.  It made the experience of reading it wearisome, like wading through the muddy banks of a river to get into the water. It took me an amazing 2 weeks to read \\"Mockingjay\\", when normally I would have chopped through at least 2 books in that time. The ending didn't wash away the muddy deposits for me; it didn't alleviate the horror I felt while reading the book.  It is not exactly fun for me to read about the nightmare of killing others, and then the protagonist having nightmares about it. So this review might not resonate with those who genuinely enjoy reading dystopic books. I do enjoy reading about a dystopia, as long as there is some leavening of the experience - whether it is in the humanity of the characters, or the occasional use of humour, or the occasional win by the protagonists.  There were far too few of the leavening elements for my enjoyment.  Other quibbles:  1. Katniss' personality was not realised for me. Was she a rebel leader, or a teen girl with all the limitations of understanding the wider political situation?  I thought the former at the beginning of the book, then veered towards the latter explanation through most of Mockingjay, until the tension and her personality is somewhat alleviated by her action towards Coin at the end. The end was not enough to persuade me to like the book, either in terms of Katniss' role in the book or of the storyline.  2. The victors' and the make up artists' fates were not realistic to me. It hadn't been really shown up in Book 2, \\"Playing with Fire\\", so it felt like a plot device to shock. Instead of making me want to read further, it felt like all the odds were too stacked in the Capital's favour.  As a reader, I want to feel like the protagonists in which I have invested my time and interest, have some pros working for them.  3. Ditto Peeta, re #2. His personality changes - from negative to positive to negative to positive - were not convincing.  4. How did Prim even make it to the Capital, let alone be a burning bird? It would have been helpful to have had some explanation that she had made it there. Instead, I thought Katniss was seeing her own recollection of Rue amongst the burning children.  Chilling, disturbing and without the requisite salve during it and at the end to make it as worthwhile for me as books 1 and 2 of this trilogy were.

0670022411|2.0|Nothing of consequence happens.  I read \\"A discovery of witches\\" by Deborah Harkness because I thought it would say something new about the fictional topic of witches, demons and vampires - and there are many YA books on that subject. But it didn't.<br /><br />The positives:<br />- The idea of a book, \\"Ashmole 782,\\" that reveals the history of the 4 types of beings - add humans to the 3 above.<br />- The locales.<br /><br />The negatives:<br />- The unlikable heroine, Diana Bishop.  So much could have been made of her witch origins. However, all we got was a blow-by-blow account of her humanness, (not humanity - as nothing resembling philosophy was even slightly dwelt on), her hunger, her tiredness, her desire, her exercising, etc. Plus we had to be told over and over how attractive and tall and intelligent ... she was. Tell, no show at all in the book.<br /><br />- There was nothing page-turning about what she did when she found the book. Instead, she went on a long hike into nothingness where she met all of Matthew's friends and family; and learnt nothing of consequence either about herself or the book.<br /><br />- There was no plot, no push and pull between evil and good, between the grey colours of choice where either option could be either morally up or down.<br /><br />- Little characterisation. We are supposed to fear the vampire matriarch, but she turns unaccountably kind.  Matthew is a grey, nothing figure, as are his cast of friends and family.<br /><br />- For a magical book, nothing magical happens.<br /><br />- Demons have been done so much better in other books, e.g. The Demon's Lexicon by Sarah Rees Brennan, Devil's Kiss by Sarwat Chadda; the Bartimaeus books by Jonathan Stroud.  For that matter, witches have been done better in Harry Potter; vampires in Stephenie Meyer's books, etc.<br /><br />- Worst of all, there is no resolution. You would expect that with no plot, there would be no resolution. Yet it irks. The set-up was there for a witchy explosion, or an expose of the reason why \\"Ashmole 782\\" was so much in demand.  But sadly, no.<br /><br />- Someone has said the book was 200 pages too long. I agree: some plot should have been factored in.

039472903X|5.0|If you're in the advertising industry, or aspiring to break in, do yourself a favor: stop reading this review and start reading Ogilvy's book. This book, although older, is not dated. Sure there are other books that will get into the specifics of new media, but in this classic you'll learn all the basics of advertising and build a foundation of knowledge that will help you create great advertising across all mediums for the rest of your career. I cannot stress enough that this book is a must read for any advertising professional, especially copywriters. Ogilvy was a true businessman who knew how to sell, and this book shows it. Even those not interested in advertising have countless lessons to learn from David Ogilvy. I guarantee you'll read it more than once.     P.S. - For all you aspiring copywriters, when you're finished with Ogilvy On Advertising be sure to pick up Luke Sullivan's \\"Hey Whipple, Squeeze This\\" and start making advertising that doesn't suck.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|...However it's a lovely little Whovian trophy for fans of the show and Doctor #10 in particular. It's not the sturdiest of things, completely plastic, and having two interchangeable writing heads under black plastic caps, and a thumb button that you push up on to extend the lighting end of the screwdriver.<br /><br />The button is actually a plastic cap that covers the screw that releases the battery compartment inside (slide out carefully!), and it's quite easy to come off, so take care - the very first thing I did after getting it out of the packaging was accidentally flick it off, and it's quite small. The cat pounced on it, and we had a merry argument over who's toy it actually was.<br /><br />It's easier to remove the writing heads (one ink, one visible only under the light built into the pen) from the body of the screwdriver than it is to get the caps off them. I'm considering simply picking one over the other of the pen heads and epoxy it into place permanently so it isn't so troublesome.<br /><br />It would be great for cosplay, or just as a sci-fi conversation piece for your own amusement. I'm happy with it.

B000002X2B|4.0|Good thing I decided to give Blows Against the Empire another listen this morning.  I suppose last night I was completely exhausted from the excessive 100-degree heatwave I've been persevering in Pennsylvania and so I wasn't thinking clearly.  It's a major struggle trying to concentrate through intense heat.  Oh well.  I do actually enjoy this album a heck of a lot more this morning with a fresher perspective and 9 hours of much needed sleep.      I still feel Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship were much much better songwriting-wise, but the entire first side of Blows Against the Empire for example really improved for me *dramatically* this morning.  I suppose I can look at this Paul Kantner album as being more on the hypnotic/dreamy side of the Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship adventure, or perhaps a journey in between the two incarnations of the band.  Either way, I'm really happy I'm able to enjoy it now because I have WAY too much respect and admiration for Paul Kantner's singing abilities to simply write him off the way I did last night.    I originally said \\"Mau Mau\\" was boring and well, a part of me still thinks it is, but the vocal melody *has* grown on me a heck of a lot more all of a sudden.  I can't explain how a rambling mess turned into gold but somehow, it did.  That never happened with any Jefferson Airplane song for example (though it *did* happen with a few Jefferson Starship songs and I imagine if, for example, I had heard \\"Miracles\\" for the first time last night considering the miserable way I was feeling, I'd consider that masterpiece of a song a rambling mess too).  \\"Let's Go Together\\" is a great pop song with... is that a banjo in the background?  I like it.  \\"A Child Is Coming\\" does NOT turn into a boring jam during the second half after all, plus the vocal melody is better than I gave it credit for last night.  I believe side two is weaker, but I suppose that too will grow on me over time.      Overall, I'll leave my original harsh review here just in case your initial reaction matches mine.  If your initial feelings DO match mine, that means you'll know there's a high chance of the album becoming better for you over time.  Here it is.    I deliberately waited a while to hear Blows Against the Empire because I was convinced it was a hidden masterpiece.  I just wanted to get through all my Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship albums first (hehe, had to be careful not to simply say \\"Starship\\" there).      Something feels missing with this album.  Actually there's at least two huge problems.  For one, Paul Kantner's vocals sound extremely forced.  It's like Paul Kantner is trying desperately to capture the crazy/unique atmosphere of a Jefferson Airplane album but never able to achieve it.  He never comes close.  \\"Mau Mau\\" is almost unlistenable as a result.   His vocals on this track are unbearable because he apparently forgot which vocal melodies are more worthy than others so he just continues to sing hoping something eventually sticks but to my displeasure, nothing ever does.  At least, not from where I stand.    Furthermore, his vocals sound flat and uninspired.  It's like this for the entire album.  Kantner, nor does the rest of the band, ever do anything remotely interesting to help move his vocals along in an exciting way, so his vocal melodies end up falling apart after a few minutes when it becomes apparent that his voice is being used for the sole purpose of dragging endlessly.  This particular complaint of mine continues for the entire album and it's downright surprising to me because this was *never* a complaint on any Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship album.  On those albums I figured the guy was such a genius that he'd find a way to make his style work no matter what.  Sadly, that's not the case and the guy's human after all.      The songwriting is alarmingly ordinary thanks to the way Paul Kantner sings the vocal melodies.  It's like he doesn't really care and he honestly sounds drunk and unaware how embarrassing he sounds.  Trust me, I absolutely love this guy any other time and believe he has one of the nicest voices in rock music, but for some unexplainable reason it's an incredibly tough task hearing his vocal work on Blows Against the Empire.      Any guitar solos are really simplistic and restrained and never able to make me feel entertained unlike his previous tenure with Jefferson Airplane.  None of these guitar solos do anything interesting at all.  They're just there for the sake of making an appearance.  I truly don't understand the appeal here, I'm afraid.  An extremely disappointing album.    \\"Hijack\\" is only memorable because the verse melody sounds remarkably similar to the one from Jefferson Airplane's \\"We Can Live Together\\".  \\"A Child Is Coming\\" has a pretty good bouncy rhythm section with nice vocals giving it a semi-emotional feeling before quickly turning into a disappointing piano-based jam with overly dramatic vocals that, again, drag for an aggravatingly extended period of time.  These two songs provide the only compliments I can give to this album.      Nowadays it seems most people prefer this Paul Kantner album over the first four Jefferson Starship albums and several Jefferson Airplane albums.  I truly fail to see why.  I think music listeners got it right back in the day- this stuff is mediocre.  This album sorely needed direction along with strong and sincere vocal melodies because that's what I've come to love about Kantner.  Whatever he was attempting to do here is a failed experiment.

B000X107GI|5.0|Batteries are good from Photoland NY, they do work very well, using my 2nd batt from there 5 pack, have had batts for few months now. They are batteries from 1999, printed on battery, problem is though, that when you test batteries on charger, they are good, but start to drain very fast to replace, don't know why this happens but it does, I just put them in my apple remote and it works just fine. Great deal for $2.50 and free ship.
B004Y1USJE|4.0|There is so much to say about Yes' Fly From Here album. Regardless of wherever your loyalties lie with any particular member of Yes, past or present, give the album a chance.    The 23-minute side-long \\"Fly From Here\\" epic has so much going on, it feels like the shortest 23 minutes you'll experience. The piano chords in the overture marks the return of Geoff Downes to Yes since leaving in 1980. When the band slams in with the short, sharp blasts of fury, then, if you're familiar at all with Yes' 1980 album Drama, you will recognize how similar those blasts are to Drama's opening track \\"Machine Messiah.\\" Benoit David's vocals come across as an eerie hybrid of Jon Anderson and Trevor Horn at first, but then by about the 9-minute mark he takes on a Midge Ure (lead singer of Ultravox) quality and maintains that the rest of the song. If you have been jonesing for new Pink Floyd music, then \\"Fly From Here Part III\\" might fill that void through Steve Howe's slide guitar solo on top of Horn's and Downe's atmospheric organ and synthesizers and drummer Alan White's slow groove. My only complaint is that \\"Part V\\" wants to be this triumphant restatement of the chorus at the end, but the transition from the quirky double-time \\"Part IV\\" to the bombast feels awkward. The whole song comes across to me as being the last dance number from a stage musical version of Casablanca, set on the tarmac and Benoit is Rick Blaine singing \\"Here's looking at you, kid\\" to Ilsa Lund.    \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\\" opens side two with Yes mainstay member Chris Squire on lead vocals. This song wouldn't be out of place on a 1990's Yes album like Talk or Open Your Eyes. It is in this song, the vocal alterations (possibly Autotune pitch correction) become fairly evident. The vocals are all too perfect-sounding, but, then again, when you remember that Yes was never a band to shun new technology, this move can be heard as much as an artistic decision as a corrective measure. Yes songs used Vocoders back in the day, too. This song also has one of the stronger hooks, musically. Lyrically, it's one of the most down-to-earth personal songs by Yes.    \\"Life On a Film Set\\" is another so-called \\"leftover\\" from 1980 (\\"Fly From Here\\" was also originally written in 1980). It was at this point I noticed that Downes' choices of synthesizer sounds and keyboards throughout the album recall the late '70s and early '80s. He really is picking up where he left off in 1980 using the same keyboards! You may think the line \\"riding the tiger\\" is silly at first, and you may never get over it, but --jeez-- when was the last time Yes released a song with a sense of humor?    \\"Hour of Need\\" is the song for all those who would miss Jon Anderson. It is very easy to imagine Jon singing this call-to-action message song, and it's evident here how Benoit's mimicry talent landed him his previous gig singing in a top-notch Yes cover band. As a song, it doesn't have a very strong melody or memorable lyrics ... pretty much like a song Jon might have written as of late (zing!).    \\"Solitaire\\" is Steve Howe's acoustic guitar showcase. It's quite beautiful. In fact, Steve's performance on the entire album is signature Steve. Steve commands more space on this album than Downe's keyboards, Squire's bass, White's drums, and even David's voice. If you are a fan of Steve Howe, this is an album you need to hear. His trademark lead guitar lines are here. While the speed and stamina has slowed down a touch, he more than compensates with taste and flair on the entire album.    \\"Into the Storm\\" immediately recalls the 1969-70 Yes, if you can believe that. Listening to this song reminds me of \\"Something's Coming,\\" \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and, especially \\"Survival\\" (because of Squire's wah-wah bass guitar). If you're familiar at all with very early Yes, then this song will surely make you smile, letting you know that while you may think that by regrouping the Drama band Yes is going too far back in time, Yes can goback much further than that. It is also on this last song of the album that Benoit sounds most like Jon Anderson.    Lastly, I bought this album on vinyl and feel compelled to forewarn anyone considering the vinyl version that the album is about 48 minutes long, 23 minutes on side one and about 25 minutes on side two. These lengths are not conducive to a particular high quality, because the grooves are packed tighter together. On my copy on each side, beginning about 13 minutes into the side, the high end begins to lightly \\"crackle.\\" This could be because of any number of reasons, like my copy was near the end of a pressing run or careless lacquer cutting. It doesn't interfere too much in my enjoyment of the music, but to some other audiophiles it might.    Fly From Here is a worthy addition to the Yes discography. It doesn't break any new ground, but it does do what Yes does best. Maybe \\"classic progressive rock\\" should be the new moniker for this genre.    In the end, it sounds here like Yes is having fun being a band and just rocking out for the sake of just rocking out (and being a little silly -- intentionally) without the burden of delivering \\"the big statement.\\"

0545259088|5.0|This is the third and final book in this beautiful series.  I really can't describe it any other way than that.  Beautiful.  Maggie Stiefvater really gets into the heads of her characters and lets you see what all is in there too.  I could feel what they were feeling.  The emotions are so real and relatable that it made me want to cry sometimes.<br /><br />Maggie's writing style is very unique.  Her descriptions are casual yet insightful and thought provoking.  Reading her book is like listening to a song that resonates for reasons you're not even sure of.  It's a love story that sets itself apart from others because it is so deep and honest.  I think we all want to have a love like this story.<br /><br />It had been awhile since I'd read the first two books and I was worried I wouldn't remember everything, but the reader is seamlessly reminded of any details they might have forgotten.  I'm not going to give any details away, but if you liked the first two books you won't be disappointed by Forever.
B004WPYNY8|4.0|Paradise Lost was somewhat weaker than its predecessors.  Iconoclast has some very, very good numbers, almost on level with some of their earlier material.  The album is definitely a good buy.  That said, the album didn't reach the levels attained with Odyssey or V: The New Mythology Suite. So for all of those who liked very solid guitar work, great singing and voice range, and overall great musicianship, this album is a definite buy.
B000002LGA|5.0|I just broke this album out today -- not only because it's long been a favorite but because it's 100 degrees here in New York City, I hadn't listened to this in awhile and I thought it would be a great backdrop for a day like this. I was right.    As many people have said, this was one of several career highs for Lou Reed. Released as the 1980s came to an end, the album \\"New York\\" sums up that decade, both in NYC and, to a lesser degree, in America at large. Listening to this album a little more than 20 years later (!), it's amazing how great it still sounds. I think there are two reasons. One is musical: for most songs, Reed employs a simple lineup of two guitars, bass and drums. This provides an effective and minimal rock and roll approach for his songs and it also pushes the lyrics to the forefront.     It's those lyrics that really make this a great disc, though! There are few if any weak songs on \\"New York.\\" For an hour, Reed complains about the downhill slide of Manhattan, AIDS, poverty, animals that are becoming extinct, violence (both inner city and domestic), religion, greed, relationships, Jesse Jackson and other subjects. You can accuse him of being a pessimist but the fact is, Reed's complaints and observations are generally right on. What's amazing when you listen to the album now is how far ahead of his time the guy was! In \\"Hold On,\\" Reed sings \\"The haves and have-nots are bleeding in the tub/That's New York's future, not mine.\\" Of course, his prediction was accurate since by 2011 (which is when I'm writing this review), the middle class in Manhattan is nearly non-existent. Similarly, in  the mellower \\"Last Great American Whale,\\" he addresses that mammal's imminent extinction. While I have no idea where whales stand now with regard to becoming extinct. there's no question that since \\"New York\\" was released, things have gone to hell environmentally, between global warming and some species of animals dying out.     For most of this album, Reed points his fingers at more general subjects, but when he gets specific his lyrics hit even closer to home. In \\"Good Evening Mr. Waldheim,\\" he goes after Jesse Jackson, accusing the politician of racism -- a ballsy move but Reed is no racist and he knows that the truth is not always politically correct. (For what it's worth, my best friend, who happens to be black, loves that tune and this whole album.)  The best line in the song may be \\"If I ran for president/And once was a member of the Klan/Wouldn't you call me on it?/ The way I call you on Farrakhan.\\" On a more sensitive note, the song \\"Dime Store Mystery,\\" which closes the album, is about the death of Reed's close friend and mentor, Andt Warhol. It ends things on a chilling, nagging note.     The centerpiece of \\"New York\\" is probably \\"Busload of Faith.\\" A great song, in which Reed lists all the things in life that you CAN'T depend on. These include friends, family, religion, the justice system, intelligence and God. \\"You can depend on the worst always happening,\\" he sing/speaks. \\"It takes a busload of faith to get by.\\" Rarely has disgust sounded so transcendent.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Ford County: Stories is a wonderful collection of short stories, loosely connected to one another, creating a word-picture of Grisham's imaginary Southern small town.  Although his novels are fun to read, his short stories really show his craft as a writer.  He deftly places his characters in scenarios that are offbeat and yet familiar.      I can't imagine what the reviewer who found the book \\"depressing\\" was thinking--I found the stories to be a rather gentle look at imperfect people in difficult situations.  A few days after I finished, I picked the book up to check on something and found myself re-reading the whole thing.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this with my granddaughter, but we didn't finish. The book kept me interested and when I bought my kindle, it was the second (third & fourth) book I purchased. I was about 1/2 way into The Hunger Games when I purchased the final two in the trilogy.<br /><br />In postapocalyptic America, specifically in District 12, we meet Katniss, her sister Prim and other important people. Katniss is 16 when it is time for the yearly event: The Hunger Games. This is sponsored by the Capitol, and is a way of reminding the 12 districts that they will never rebel again. The Capitol obliterated District 13, or so it believes.<br /><br />When the lottery calls Primrose, Katniss's young sister, Katniss volunteers to take her place. As she stands on the podium, she remembers a boy who saved the family from starvation when she was younger. The baker's son burnt bread and then brought it to her, even though he was whipped for doing this. When she hears his name, she is stunned.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a fight to the finish where only one of twenty-four 12-18 year olds will survive. She will have to fight Peeta for her life. Thus begins an enthralling adventure that I could not stop until I read all three books in four days.<br /><br />There are elements of horror in the story during fighting and some very gruesome scenes as it comes to a close. Betrayal by the government who are entertained by the children fighting to kill in order to save their own lives. Romance as Peeta and Katniss are presented as star crossed lovers. Great characters with depth and histories making them very real.<br /><br />I recommend this trilogy with 5 stars. If you buy one, buy all three.<br /><br />Victoria Tarrani<br />.

B004Z2TUGE|3.0|On the whole I did like the characters, the actors did a good job of making them interesting.  The effects were really good, and the story itself not bad.  The ending struck me as kind of odd, corny, but it doesn't really ruin the film.
0307477479|2.0|I was initially quite excited to read this book however was very disappointed after the first half. I had a difficult time understanding or empathizing with the characters.   I felt cheated when 75 pages were wasted by diagrams and notes that I did not think added to the story  .... and then to make matters worse felt the story was very disjointed after the diagrams.   I  also found the ending quite disappointing.  I am sorry but i would not recommend this book.....
B0041KKYBA|1.0|This had the potential to be important as so many significant people allowed themselves to participate. However, I suspect that the clips on the cutting room floor provided more insight than what was included. It is inconceivable that none of the people interviewed mentioned the pressure from Congress, Clinton, Bush etc for affordable housing and how this pressure was brought bt bear on the banking system to make loans to people that could not repay them. The Community Reinvestment Act. It is inconceivable that none of the people interviewed mentioned the efforts to regulate Fannie and Freddie that were blocked by Barney Frank, Chris Dodd and then Sen Obama. It is inconceivable that not one person interviewed suggested that there was a failed level of responsibility accepted by those that lied to get mortgages which they knew that they could not pay. The movie ends by stating that the financial industry corrupted the political system. Corruption means \\"act dishonestly for money or personal gain.\\" It is not possible to corrupt some one who does not want to be corrupted. Those who took the most money from Fannie and Freddie to advance their political careers were Dodd, Frank, Obama. Strange this was not mentioned nor were there attempts to interview them and ask them to explain themselves.
1442419814|1.0|I really don't see how this book got such a good rating?! When I read the summary of the book, and looked up the reviews on here, I was really excited to start reading it. I love the concept behind it, but the author did a HORRIBLE job at expanding on it in an intelligent way. I literally felt like I was reading a book written BY a ten year old. The book is insanely repetitive (When Tally was trying to talk about of uglies and pretties and Shay kept incessantly saying she wanted to ride the hoverboard?? I felt like ripping my hair out, so annoying!!!) Honestly, I can't even begin to say how boring and repetitive this book was. I abide by the \\"50 page rule\\" and with this book I barely made it there. I even skipped ahead chapters to see if there was anything interesting, anything about the actual process of turning pretty.... any type of sci-fi futuristic parts, but nothing!!   Also, the part with the machine just SO conveniently shooting a mask out? LAME! ... and the part with the bungee jacket?? ugh!!! I HATE THIS BOOK!!!

0062060554|5.0|\\"Before I Go to Sleep\\" is a brilliant and profound piece of fiction, a psychological thriller that will captivate the reader about a traumatic brain injury that when the main protagonist wakes up she can't remember anything about herself. I can't imagine too many things as frightening as that! The premise was different from anything I've read before. This is a remarkable job of taking us through Christine's mind as she learns about events and people in her past and the frustrations involved in not being able to remember. She keeps a journal, at the suggestion of Dr. Nash; the idea being that she progressively remembers her life before the accident that caused her amnesia. The first part of the book tells about her meeting her husband and her psychiatrist calling her, telling her that she needs to read the journal she has been keeping. He gives it to her and tells her to contact him if she wants to continue her treatment. What a pulse-pounding thriller! It's suspenseful throughout and the pacing is brilliant. The thriller ending is not predictable so don't bother. Profound and completely captivating, yes, but the intrigue will keep your eyes glued.

0345528581|4.0|This book is a bible for bodyweight workouts. Really 4.5 stars. This type of working out is best for people who don't have the time (or maybe the money) to go to a gym. There are a couple of points that merit mentioning here though, one would be Lauren stating he doesn't recommend protein supplements on nearly the next page after he mentions Met-Rx and Cytogainer. My experience with Met-Rx is that it is good for bulking up, if you don't need bulking don't drink Met-Rx. Also, there IS a difference between types of proteins. While Lauren may have mentioned it I didn't see the fact that if you are lactose intolerant you want to stay far away from whey protein, especially considering protein supplements tend to cause gas. Whey protein for the lactose intolerant could be explosive and shift your focus from your workout to your gastro. Finally, males should consider that soy proteins can and have cause(d) estrogenic effects that work against most males desire to increase testosterone production. I personally find egg protein to be the best for me.    I look forward to following the workouts and exercises outlined in this book. If Arnold made the bible of weightlifting, Lauren has made the bible of bodyweight workouts.

0756404738|2.0|THE NAME OF THE WIND gave me hope that I had discovered a good trilogy, not just a good book. That hope is now on life support. The second installment of a good trilogy answers some/most questions from the first installment and asks *new* questions. It raises the stakes to nearly hopeless levels. It leaves Han Solo frozen in carbonite. The second installment of a good trilogy does *not* string the reader along with hardly any rewards, without keeping the promises that were set up in the first book, and wave a little flag on the last page that reads, \\"You want answers? Read Book Three, mwa-ha-ha.\\"<br /><br />Lack of payoff aside, THE WISE MAN'S FEAR fails for two main reasons: first, the author's self-indulgent discarding of the rules of story proportion. For example, don't spend 70 pages on the hero's carnal education from a sex-obsessed faerie and one page on a life-threatening shipwreck. Don't spend the first 350 pages on Daily Life At The University and one page on a six-day trial at which the hero is accused of magic malfeasance. Don't spend 150 pages on learning a foreign culture, including the culture's puerile emphasis on sex--both encounters and discussions. Ever. Just don't do that, period. The book needed a pitiless editor, one that would have said, \\"This book is about twenty-five percent too long.\\"<br /><br />Alongside the proportion problem is lack of tension. Entire chapters pass without raising the stakes, without making things worse or even changing the state of, well, anything. Far too many scenes don't hold even interpersonal tension, and many that do feel forced, particularly Kvothe's fight with Denna in Severen and his outburst to the Maer's wife about his heritage. The author knew how he wanted scenes to end, so he pushed the dialogue in that direction with no attempt at subtlety.<br /><br />Will I read Book Three? Grudgingly, yes. But unless it delivers real tension, not forced tension; unless it puts Kvothe in real, physical and emotional danger; and unless Mr. Rothfuss bridles his creative appetite long enough to learn language economy and narrative focus, I will not slog through his writing again.hfuss bridles his creative appetite long enough to learn language economy and narrative focus, I will not slog through his writing again.

034552554X|5.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh's novel The Language of Flowers is the best fiction I've read this year. So good that I didn't want to stop reading it, I'd tell myself just one more chapter and then get upset because I didn't want to leave her character, Victoria, without finding out what happened next. From the opening chapter, Victoria's story grabbed me emotionally. The beauty and the tragic realness of her character, the way she interacted with the people in her life, her heartbreaking hopefulness and self-sabotaging behavior kept me wishing that someone would see below the surface and bring healing to her wounded soul.<br /><br />Victoria Jones is 18 and aging out of foster care in San Francisco. She is angry and hurting from being raised in the system. She has gone from house to house and group home to group home where her need for love and family were not met. At 10 she finds her best chance at adoption with Elizabeth, a woman who lives alone on a vineyard. She teaches Victoria about grapes and the names and meanings of flowers. It is the meaning of flowers that Victoria grabs onto and this language from the Victorian era helps her navigate through life.<br /><br />I read this advanced readers copy through the Amazon vine program and can't wait until it comes out in August 2011 so that I can buy copies. It's a perfect gift, because it appeals to so many people: anyone who loves children, those who care about what's happening to our marginalized kids, social workers, foster parents, mental health advocates, or gardeners, lovers of flowers, florists, wedding planners, midwifes and young adults. The list is long but there are probably more types of readers who would like this story. 5 stars, wish I could give it more.
B003UESJFQ|4.0|This movie appeared only for the briefest of moments in the cinema, mostly the art house circuit. The story revolves around the female Ford factory workers in Dagenham England who finally stood up to say no more second class treatment. Their rebellion started the equal pay for women movement. This occurred in the tumulteous year of 1968. The events portrayed here surely have some dramatic license added in. No matter it is fun and enjoyable. Sally Hawkins plays a Ford worker who stands up to lead the strikers but faces resentment and anger from all directions, even in her own family. The always beautiful Rosamund Pike plays an educated and refined woman married to a person of prominence who opposes the factory women. Bob Hoskins is the only person in the male dominated union who encourages the woman to really go for it. The other fun element is the music of 1968 which is featured to great effect. Not music like the Stones & Beatles that we still here all the time. Forgotten hit singles like \\"Israelites\\" \\"all or nothing\\" and \\"wooly bully\\" are featured. It is a fun feel good movie all around.

030716327X|5.0|This is a must have for little ones.  I had it for my children (now 30 and 26) and I bought it for my grandson.  It is particularly useful to keep little ones occupied in church.
0736083863|5.0|Not since high school physical education in the late 1960s, have I known which muscles were being worked by specific exercises.  All I knew was come morning parts of me would hurt, sometimes a lot, after I exercised.  This book shows which move affects which muscles or muscle groups.  It helps when understanding the \\"why\\" an exercise is done in a certain way as well has \\"how\\" to do it properly.  Good illustrations, excellent explanations.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I just installed this application today and I'm already a big fan! It's. MUCH better than the standard Android keyboard and the auto correct and suggestions work great.  Definitely worth the price.
1416909532|4.0|I did not read other reviews before I bought this book.  Be aware: this is NOT the original book.  This book is little phrases and ideas from the original book.  Each page is simply an idea from the book, sort of like a mantra to keep in mind.  However, this book is still entertaining, even if it was not what I was expecting.  It was a quick read and one that definitely made me chuckle quite a few times.  If you are looking for something that is a fast self-help book without steps, this is definitely the book for you.  If you want a full-fledged book with a lot of details, this is  not the book for you.
B00158K0S8|5.0|I have watched Patton via cable, satellite, dvd, and now Blu-Ray (alas, I am too young to have watched it in theaters). This Blu-Ray version was a joy to watch. The long scenes throughout this movie really benefited from the quality that comes from a Blu-Ray release. I think that the epic that Patton is really has been rendered well here.
B004CR5TD0|4.0|Often in modern popular music, technology and studio wizardry are used as a way to overcompensate for lack of musical talent and ability. Autotune makes mediocre singers listenable. Loops and samples take the place of live instruments. But sometimes, when talented musicians make use of modern technology to explore and experiment, magic can happen. That's definitely the case with this album.<br /><br />James Blake's soulful, world-weary voice sounds decades older than his 21 years. And although his vocals and some of his lyrics recall classic soul and blues records, he doesn't seem much interested in conventional song structure. Instead, his vocals are combined with minimalist but often jarring electronic beats, atmospheric soundscapes, and occasional live instruments.<br /><br />The whole album evokes a mournful, elegiac feeling, as if it's an album recorded by a soul in transition ... mourning the loss and mistakes of one life, with a glimmer of hope for the next.
B005BO4OY8|4.0|This is Groundhog Day but set as a drama, and the time lived over again is 8 minutes.....    What would you do if you had 8 minutes to find a bomb and solve the crime and you had to do it over and over and over until you solved it?  And each time, you got blown to bits if you failed?    That is pretty much the plot.  There is a bomb on a train. You have 8 minutes to find it.  Fail, and you get blown to bits along with your female companion and you have to do it over.  Each time a bit more of what is going on is revealed to you, and a bit more of what is going on is discovered      Nice little plot twist at the end even though I saw it coming!    Enjoyed the movie, the picture quality on the streaming was acceptable but limited by my Roku to 720p
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I really liked the concept of using mirrors and prisms to reflect, split or combine colored lasers and match the color of the goal. The interface is nice and simple and game is easy to play. The difficulty is finding the right combination of prisms and mirrors to use.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Have tried out several Android keyboards (8pen, swiftkey, thumbkey and smart keyboard) and SwiftKey is clearly my favorite.    I did notice after installing this version that my Handcent emojis were not being displayed properly. They had extra characters attached to them and when I tried to delete them, it turned the emoji to a string of letters and numbers.  Hopefully there is a fix the dev team can implement. Other than that, great keyboard!
0545123291|4.0|Sam is still human and yet afraid to hope, to even believe that he has been cured. On top of his constant worrying if his cure will be short lived, he has the extra responsibility of caring for the pack which includes newly created wolves. Meanwhile, Grace is showing signs of a sickness that Sam knows all too well....she smells of wolf.<br /><br />Newly created wolf/teen rockstar, ex-junkie Cole St Clair is new to the pack and only wants to lose himself in being a wolf. He just wants to escape his life, one filled with expectations and pain. He doesn't want to remember anything about being a human. The only problem is that Cole can't stay a wolf because his body is betraying him. It seems to have a mind of his own, switching between his human and wolf form constantly,  while the other wolves can stay in their animal forms until the winter thaws. To complicate matters, while Cole seemed to have been one of Beck's (Sam's adopted father's) favorites, he's not endearing or even liked by Sam. So while Sam struggles with being human, leading the pack, Grace's illness and her parent's wrath, he also is left to decipher why Beck would make the lead singer of the rockband (Narkoteka) a wolf.<br /><br />The other central character, rebellious/spoiled and misunderstood Isabel is still reeling from her brother's death, of which she feels responsible. True to form she doesn't blink when she finds a nude Cole still shivering from the change. Finding that they are somewhat kindred spirits, the two most unlikely people find themselves drawn to each other. While separately they do not seem to be very likable, there is a vulnerability that each character has that endears them to the reader. We soon becomes invested in the outcome of Isabel and Cole's lives, just as we do Sam and Grace.<br /><br />What I did appreciate about Linger was the beautiful quality of the words. The author (Stiefvater) writes with an honesty and beauty that brings emotion to the author. She also has the uncanny ability to make you sympathize and like those characters who initially every instinct tells you to hate. In the end, you grow to understand both Isabel and Cole and want to see them have a happily ever after. And while Sam and Grace appear to be the modern day Romeo and Juliette, you also know that things will work out better for them than the I'll-fated couple. In conclusion, I can honestly say that while there are some unresolved issues, the pros of reading the story outweigh the cons. I give Linger a solid 4 and highly recommend it to those who are in to paranormal young adult novels.sympathize and like those characters who initially every instinct tells you to hate.

B0055FR5PS|2.0|Very weak story. Jiggle cam run amok. Looks like it was used to cover weak effects in some places. Talk about politically correct casting and story, one of each and the same old new officer and old Sargent dynamic and not done that well, and the worst is the virgin from the Midwest. We have a blended armed forces, that's realistic but they were just so overt about it, it made it cheesy. Almost a recruitment ad.<br /><br />Over dramatic for sure. Camera shots hold so we can be sad at the right times, so over done. None of that in Private Ryan so it can be done without telling me when to be sad, shocked etc. Eckhart is fine and likeable in his role, not the real macho idiot, gets things done like real NCO's do. But the back story on him is done once again in a drama queen style, so so overdone. Thought he might be miscast in the previews but did OK. No real problems with the cast at all just executing a lame story. No stupid one liners that I remember. The flying vehicle propulsion was a neat idea that came off realistic and new. Not a lot of explanation on how the alien thing started and that is fine. This is a story about marines going in. After our water? That is ok though. Didn't dwell on things to make it even worse.<br /><br />The unsteady cam just seemed to be covering for small sets, weak effects, and confusion to mask a weak story. A big negative. Came off as a cost cutting trick. And SO irritating. Put the camera in a box with a small pinhole next time. Might be better. They really need to come up with a new filming style for action movies. Or how about a regular steady shot and a good story. Rented off Amazon unbox. Glad I didn't buy it.  Really wanted to like this one.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Great processor, highly recommended. Not to mention my last own PC had a Pentium D, and now since I am working at home, and refused to buy a Mac I opted to build my own setup, this new computer setup works like a charm. I have been doing my Graphic Design projects on this, 2 + Gb psd images are exported like a breeze.
B00004YTIQ|4.0|My star rating may be low, because some of the questions weren't relevant (this is not a fun or educational toy)!  That said, this work's great on my 120\\" inflatable rectangular pool, the fit is perfect.  I'm very happy with how far down the side flaps go down, I've never had wind get under the cover and certainly it has kept out all debris.  Even though there has been some dicoloration due to the sun, it hasn't affected the durability of the plastic.  The only area that is showing some wear is the \\"grommet\\" areas that the cord goes through.  Mine hasn't worn through yet, but probably will next year, I think I will reinforce the area with some duct tape.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This is a great soundtrack - propelled mostly by the powerful vocals of Aguilera. The numbers here are kind of a continuation from the Back To Basics gennre.    If you watched the movie, it kind of brings to life the songs - full of energy, zest and verve. It makes you want to clap and dance along.     Cher's contribution here may not be the lion's share but her power ballad You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me is just mesmerizing. Reminds me of her rock stuff like Heart Of Stone and Love Hurts.    The CD is a very snappy, fast paced and ends a little too quickly after 30 minutes - making you want more, more more!
B004BSFC46|3.0|Love the concept but my son just didn't take to them and never really looked at them from 3-4 months in age.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's rare that a young adult series catches my attention. There seem to be fewer and fewer note worthy books out there directed at the iGeneration. However an educator friend of mine recommended this series to me and I decided to give it a shot. I was glad that I did.    Ms Collins does an amazing job of creating a dystopia that not only feels very real but feels very true in it's people and motives. These people truly feel like they are doing the best they can in a harsh world in a harsh time. From the sometimes almost comical and often times disgusting people of the capital, to the hard lives people of the various districts, people feel very true to their world. No body feels like their ways or motives are over forced. You can even see the twisted logic and the feeling of right in the cruel Hunger games. It's an amazingly well crafted world we hope we will never live in.    One warning however this book will be an emotional ride. You will get attached to characters and they will die. You will see some people that you will in a few chapters grow to like suffer greatly. These books were not meant to be pleasant romps on a silly game. These books have people being forced to fight and kill one another for the sake of their community. They can save their people from near starvation or they can die. It is not an idle threat nor one that they \\"hand hold sing and dance\\" their way through.    If you enjoy a well written brilliantly created, but horrible world. You can't go wrong with these novels. If you are expecting a happy ending where every body smiles in the end you might want to explore other options.    5 stars for excellence.
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|I purchased these for my son after seeing a friend's daughter play wonderfully with a similar product (though her mom complained that hers were too big and didn't stay on which I could see was true... our kids are the same age).  The fabric does not stretch and my son was a big boy at 3 months.  They barely fit then and now his feet are too big to put them on at all at 4 months.  He also never paid any attention to them but I think that's just differences in personality and development.
B004WCTLNY|1.0|If you buy the premise that guys in black suits and fedoras are running around guiding your destiny, this travesty of a movie might be right up your alley....    Did Matt Damon read the screenplay?  Is the studio head who greenlighted this project still employed???
B004SCE4SK|5.0|Its fresh and new. From beginning to end every track is nice and enjoyable to listen too. Nice beats, lyrics, and mixed very well. Would you rather listen to wack a$$ flo-rida?
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Even though it's a bit laggy on my old Eris (running CM 7, GSB) , the predictions are good enough to more than make up for the lost time. I'll be upgrading soon and I can't wait to see what it does with a phone that isn't seriously under-powered.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I got it when it was free app of the day. Was fun for few min but never really got into it.    Graphics are decent but in the ends its a phone game, what do you want? :)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|then this is the keyboard for you. not a lot of speed and also take too much of your screen but it offers something that no other keyboard is doing and that&apos;s combining the languages
B004WPYNY8|5.0|This album is amazing. After Paradise Lost I didn't think Symphony X would be able to push beyond that, but they have. This album is more aggressive and brutal than the previous one and I love the concepts found in the lyrics on this album. If you're a Symphony X fan, this is a must have. I've been a fan since they released The Odyssey and they keep amazing me with each release. Do yourself a favor and listen to it.
B003Y5H59W|4.0|Captain America is a very enjoyable ride with a good amount of laughs and action. The cinematography was done very well giving it that WWII feel. The action was very entertaining but the only bad thing about it was it was rushed into. There isn't any build up to it at all and when they reveal the shield, it didn't have that spark to the crowd like it should. Overall though I give the movie a B and recommend it to anyone who likes Super Hero Films. Definitely stay past the credits...you won't regret it at all!
0634022296|1.0|If you are looking for a chord guide to Beatles tunes, pass this book by and save yourself a few bucks.  Not only do a large percentage of the songs have the wrong chords, but the chord diagrams would require the player to have 6 fingers!  On many songs, the chord changes are indicated at the wrong place.  Cheap \\"perfect\\" binding insures that not only will this book fall apart with minimal use but also won't stay open to the page you want.  I can not think of one positive thing to say about this dreadful book.
B00275EGX8|3.0|I was waiting to rent this movie online but decided on buying the film once the blu-ray price came down. The movie was good but best picture?  I don't think so.  Should have waited.
B005529BDK|4.0|got this as a free app of the day.     It's pretty fun, reminds me a bit of bust a move and bejeweled. It's a nice quick casual game.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This show was quite intelligent and because of that it is cancelled. I still hope that it would be renewed.
B001DHXT6G|1.0|The newly added CGI effects add NOTHING to enhance an intelligent viewers' appreciation of this classic series. They stick out like a sore thumb and completely destroy any enjoyment of the episodes. They are simply there to pander to the lowest common denominator: the undereducated viewer who simply CANNOT appreciate the value of something 40 years old on its' own terms. Its another depressing indication of how dumbed down things are today. Grown-ups should definitely leave them on the shelf. Granted, the technical quality of the remastered sixties footage is amazing - shame they couldn't leave the pointless, intrusive, horrible CGI rubbish off it.    Star Trek is no longer in the hands of those who treasure it - just cynical corporate b*st*rds who only treasure taking money off people who don't know any better.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|What I like about the show was its realistic future technology and its realistic science fiction antagonist \\"us\\". There are no aliens, no disgusting star trek next generation \\"oh we are so advanced geistlich\\" approach. The film is a continuation of this very good show and would be a very good science ficton movie as a stand alone film.
B001VEHZZ2|3.0|This was a relatively easy read.  I think it digested better than it read.  Meaning, given time to think about it, I gained an interesting message: maybe not the one the author meant, but interesting nonetheless.  There is a lot of flak in the book (if it's not flak, I really missed the point), but I think that the book was about the utter rejection of the West, no matter how rich and valuable the experience, by those with an Islamic background.  For all the appearance of common ground, there is none.  But that's just me.
0596009208|5.0|I have never said this about a technical book, but I LOVE Head First Java! I actually look forward to reading each new chapter. Not to mention that the innovative Head First concept of teaching really makes the facts stick to your brain. Aside from that it is quite entertaining to read. I will definitely be reading more books in this series. Congratulations O'Reilly and company on a true triumph in technical writing!
0439882826|5.0|This is the HOLY GRAIL of pop-up books. It is simply mind-blowing intricacy. It must have been designed by a genius. Mine arrived wrapped in plastic with a plastic pull-tap to keep the battery new. I'm so impressed I will be buying at least 2 more probably. This book is an amazing work of art that any man, woman, or child will appreciate.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|My father pushed The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon at me for 10 years but I wouldn't read it. I was mad at Stephen King because he had let me down, selling out to write gory horror movies during his drug & alcohol addiction spell. He was on the wagon (and thankfully still is) when he wrote this one though. While obstensibly a simple story of a girl lost in the woods (with some scary stuff thrown in - it IS SK still), it is also, like The Stand (my fave book by him), very much about God. I get it now, Daddy!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I was using Swype until Flex T9 came along. I have been using that ever since. Since SwiftKey is free today, I thought I'd give it a shot. I like how it uses your actual language from your past typing. But I'm so used to using the Swype type interface that it actually slows me down. If they added this style interface, I would rate it higher.   Bottom line: If you are using the stock keyboard, you won't be disappointed. But if you have already moved to different keyboard, you will probably be better off skipping this unless it's still free.
B000IOM0WY|1.0|I enjoy this movie have it on both DVD and Blu Ray.  The Blu Ray transfer is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! Don't buy it!
0300169787|5.0|I've always been a bit skeptical of Mr.McQeen.  His fashions are not wearable for 99.99% of us.  But I started collecting Asian Ball Jointed Dolls last year and, after looking at fashions for them to make, I have a new respect for this kind of art.   The book is very well written, and the clothes are presented beautifully.  There is a lot of fabulous inspiration for those in the fashion, jewelry, or accessories industries.   It is a brown cloth covered book with a hologram of the skull you see that morphs into Alexander McQueen.  Very clever, some might consider it in poor taste, considering his passing.  But it actually is quite in keeping with his style. Someone famous once said \\"there is no good art without an element of death,\\" and I agree, even if it just a bit of asymmetry.  It is quite evident here.  The models and mannequins look a bit like corpses and there are feathers and scales and skulls galore.  Why aren't they still on the animals?  But it looks damn good.  If that's something that turns you off, you may not like this book.  The new designer in charge of his label cannot touch this stuff.  We truly lost an icon.
B00004VWAF|2.0|I write as a huge fan of Miles Davis' electric period. For me this is the most fascinating period of his music, 70's Miles is my favourite Miles decade - and my favourite late 20th century music too.      So I'd like to say, first of all, that the issue here has nothing to do with purism, \\"classic jazz\\" versus electric or \\"fusion\\", forget all this nonsense. The only problem with this album is simply that it isn't very good.    It stands oddly in the middle of the period, in 1972, between two peaks: The first peak being his studio work of 1969-70 which yielded In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, Jack Johnson and the best part of Big Fun. The other peak is 1973-75, as documented on Get Up With It and Agharta/Pangea. All of those are absolutely monumental musical statements.    Recorded in-between, On the Corner was an experiment, an interesting experiment: to create a moving tapestry of rhythms and sounds. It certainly wasn't an attempt to \\"sell\\" to the pop market - the accusation i've frequently read about, and which I find totally ludicrous given the abstraction of the work.     As interesting as the concept was, it doesn't seem to get anywhere: the layers, the rhythms and the motifs simply pass by, at once too cluttered for ambiance and too loose for attentive listening. The album has been re-appraised as a forerunner of 90's modern dance styles: this could be a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on your perspective on said styles. When the album is over, I feel a sigh of relief coming - bad sign when I can't get enough of the other electric albums.    Interestingly the On the Corner sessions yielded the track \\"Ife\\", which Teo Macero used for the patchwork album Big Fun. \\"Ife\\" is actually a nicer piece than anything on On the Corner: a beguiling groove with something more melodic which dissolves into an ambient mood where Mutme's African water Drums mix with the sound of organ and wha-wha trumpet: that, actually, was pointing forward to Agharta and Pangea.    Still i'll be coming back to this album. It is, after all, electric Miles Davis.
0817439390|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me when I started taking an interest in photography and mentioned the possibility of getting a DSLR camera. I'm very happy that I took the recommendation to heart and read this book--it has been the most useful guide that I've read so far.    Even with my point and shoot, exposure is something that I've chronically struggled with--and I know I can't be the only one! My photos are always under- or over-exposed, never in-between. I spent lots of time trying to correct this in various editing software during post-processing, when I just wish I could have gotten it RIGHT when I took the picture in the first place! This book really helped me understand the combination of ISO, aperture, and shutter speed, allowing me to not just take pictures that are no longer under- or over-exposed, but also convey the impression I wanted.    The layout of the book is confusing if you're looking for a reference guide where you can flip to a certain page, read a paragraph, and put the book away. That's only going to make sense if you're looking for a brief refresher because you already know the general information in the book. However, I did appreciate the way everything was arranged as someone who intended to (and did) read it cover to cover. Everything was clearly explained and the new content built on the old content. It reads as a cohesive whole, not as a choppy combination of notes. The focus on concepts, rather than specific settings, makes the information easy to apply to any camera regardless of make or model. For example, even though I read this to improve my skills with a DSLR, I've used the same information to take better pictures with my point and shoot.    It was a fantastic book; after reading a loaned copy, I purchased my own to have on hand. I don't think it's \\"the best photography book ever,\\" but if you're new and confused, it is a WONDERFUL starting point to learn some concepts that you can immediately put into action!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I finally found this keyboard after trying so many other Apps on the net. this one is definitely the best!
B004NSULHM|1.0|For the last ten-plus years I have been an apologist for Radiohead as they've slowly and collectively lost their damn minds.  No longer.  With the dreadful pile of aural dreck that passes for Radiohead's new \\"album,\\" I am done wasting my time with these pretentious gits.  Clearly OK Computer was such a triumphant accomplishment for them that, realizing they could never top it, they've made a deliberate effort to not even try.  Previous albums have contained one or two worthwhile tracks amongst all the random electronic farting and burping noises, and this was enough for me to give them a mulligan.  But this latest effort is almost defiantly lacking in not only a single worthwhile track, but even a few seconds' worth of sound of ANY sort that a normal human being free of mental illness would find soothing or pleasing.  If I played this album to prison inmates I could be sued for violating their constitutionally-mandated protection from cruel and unusual punishment.  There's some unspoken in-joke amongst society at large that anything Radiohead releases is going to be automatically oohed and ahhed over, no matter how jarring, arhythmic, and pretentious.  The hell with that.  I'm all for artists experimenting and trying to push their limits, but if the end-result is \\"music\\" that makes me want to jam red-hot knitting needles into my ears to make it go away, screw it.  Why bother?  The sooner somebody takes Thom Yorke out into the backyard and gives him the bitch-slap he's so desperately needed since at least 2001, the better it will be for all of us...
B001OQCV2E|3.0|I'm sure this could be titled \\"John Cusack Saves the World... without really doing anything\\".  The Emmerich brothers are well known for their love of big budget disaster epics, with \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Godzilla\\", and \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" already on their resumes.  It should come as no surprise that they would use the myth of the Mayan calendar predicting the end of the world in the year 2012 as fertile soil for their latest and `greatest' blow-em-up film.        In \\"2012\\", there appears to be some sort of solar confluence causing the Earth's mantle to melt, leading to catastrophic shifts in its tectonic plates.  This change is supposed to be caused by increased neutrino activity from the sun (which, of course, cannot possibly have this effect... but you'll need to go to the \\"Bad Astronomy\\" web site for all the ways the science goes haywire in this film).       Of course, while all this catastrophic activity is going on, absentee husband/father, John Cusack, must frantically drive (and fly) around to save his kids, ex-wife, and her new boyfriend.  And he must do this while meeting a typical `quirky' array of disaster film characters (the goofy conspiracy theorist no one believes; the rich magnate who knows more than he is letting on; and the earnest do-gooder who is trying to do what's `right' amidst the crisis).         Crisp plots and three-dimensional characters have never been a hallmark of Emmerich films.  These little pieces of exposition are just necessary evils for them to pass the time between explosions.  However, unlike the cynicism of Michael Bay films, the Emmerichs at least try to see the good in humanity amid a crisis (even if it is the most laughable ways possible).  I enjoyed watching this film.  Even though it is overly long and the conclusion drags on forever, the film is basically an enjoyable time-waster.         One directors' trademark is their inability to create a truly reprehensible villain (other than the faceless disaster).  They try to make out Oliver Platt to be this heartless bureaucrat only out for his own hide.  Yet, his actions and opinions make a lot more sense and are infinitely more practical the wide-eyed (and angry) naivety of the geologist played by Chiwetel Ejiofor (who I expected more from given the power of other roles he has been in).       Woody Harrelson is amusing as the conspiracy theorist who has it all figured it out.  Danny Glover is just laughable as the president.  But, it is the plot involving Cusack saving his family that gives the most head-scratching.  They are in a rush to get from place to place to avoid the disaster, but they always seem to stop at the oddest moments; whether it is to admire a plane, watch birds flying away, or to stop their vehicle far enough away from one plane so that it sets up another in a series of ridiculous close class.  On top of that, Cusack's character really isn't that likeable.  He's very detached from the other characters (even his wife and kids) and you can almost understand why his wife left him in the first place.        But, I digress.  I'm not looking for the works of Shakespeare in an Emmerich film.  I'm just looking for solid entertainment in the movie theaters and good background noise when it comes on cable at home.  \\"2012\\" succeeds on both counts.

B0034JKZ86|5.0|I watched this tonight with my 2 boys. They loved it! My children are 3 and 10 and neither of them were scared. ( some people said this was scary ) It has a great moral to this story and I loved that it was set in New Orleans. To all the people who were against the voodoo in this movie, please it's a cartoon. Voodoo is part of New Orleans history along with the yummy gumbo, jambalaya and beignet references in the movie. This is a great story and a little taste of good old New Orleans :)

0553801473|3.0|I wanted to love this book, I really did.  I've waited 6 years, and I reread all four previous books (even AFFC) in preparation.  I need not have bothered.  This book was disjointed and disappointing. It started as early as the prologue, which has absolutely no link to the rest of the book, right down to the epilogue, which for some reason introduced a new point of view, if not a new character.  The rest, with the exception of a few very interesting developments, felt like filler.<br /><br />Daenerys, who has always been one of my favourite characters, has no development whatsoever.<br />Jon has great development, until he does something so totally against everything else he's done in the rest of the book that it boggles the mind.<br />Bran is as dull as ever.<br />Cersei and Jaime both have chapters that should, IMHO, have been left on the editing floor.<br />And on, and on, and...<br /><br />At this point, I can't see where the story is going and I'm not sure GRRM does either.  I hope he's not writing for the TV series as many have suggested, but frankly the gratuitous swearing and sex, in a series that has never resorted to that in the past, kind of feels like he is.<br /><br />I only hope the next installment is the last, and that it does not take another 6 years to complete.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I never leave ratings but on this one I had to. It is awesome!! Easy to use!!!! A must have.

B0053YEM7U|2.0|And a word:  weak.   This newest incarnation of YES lacks the creativity and musicianship of classic progressive YES albums of the past.  While the Fly From Here suite of songs makes an attempt to harken back to the days of Close to the Edge and Tales from Topographic Oceans, it simply lacks the soaring melodies and intensity of YES's mid- to late-1970s work.  David Benoit's voice, while solid, makes me greater appreciate Jon Anderson's falsetto vocals.  Solitaire is a traditional Steve Howe solo spot that is on par with Masquerade from Union, although not comparable to The Clap.  The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be, Life On A Film Set, and Hour Of Need do not contain any memorable riffs or lyrics and are boring.  The album's finale, Into The Storm, attempts to deliver a fast-paced, Drama-style pseudo-progressive sound, but it is too little, too late.  None of the songs on Fly From Here delivers a progressive sound, but none of the songs delivers a hit like the Cinema-era YES did with Owner of a Lonely Heart and Changes.  Instead, Fly From Here is caught in between--not quite progressive and not quite radio rock.  There are highlights that include superior-as-usual bass playing and backing vocals from Chris Squire.   But, what is clear about that this incarnation of YES is that it lacks the virtuoso playing and songwriting of Rick Wakeman, and without the \\"lead\\" keyboards, Steve Howe and Geoff Downes need to step up and write and play melodies that provide more than ethereal accompaniment to soft-rock sounding Benoit vocals.  The lack of classic YES-sounding guitar and keyboard parts, and the lack of classic odd-time beats, exposes Alan White, who is a great rock drummer, but not great enough to add any extra elements that Bill Bruford might have.   YES needs to figure out what type of band they want to be.  If they want to be a rock band, they need to write catchy tunes that radio listeners can sing along to.  If they want to return to their progressive roots, theyneed to commit wholeheartedly to writing the difficult to play, yet inspirational epics that set the standard for the next generation of progressive metal bands like Dream Theater.   Something in between, which is what Fly From Here is, falls short of both potential goals.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|To me what made this stand out was the story, written by someone who knew or had heard of the ins and outs and tricks of the so-called justice system. This isn't the first movie in which Matthew plays a lawyer, and there's something about him that makes him especially fitting for the part. Ryan P. has filled out a bit since I last saw him in Crash, and he seems perfect for the pretty rich boy role he was cast into. *spoiler at asterisk<br /><br />Still, the plot was the main feature here. It seems to tell us that when it's all about the money, there's a lot of dirty tricks that can be used to rig the game. I don't think all of this stuff can be made up, so perhaps we've been given a glimpse into the scandals inherent in the system.<br /><br />*But, what was his motive to kill from the beginning? Who was trying to frame the lawyer and what was their personal motive in doing so? Why would Ryan implicate himself in a murder? He didn't appear to be the killing type; it seemed random. Was it because his mother was a hooker (or dealt her sex for good real estate deals), and he found out, couldn't hurt her, so he takes it out on other hookers?

B003Y5H59W|5.0|Marvel seems to be resembling Pixar as of late, considering how they've made so many high quality movies, and success after success at the box office, with a seemingly unbroken string of great superhero films, from Iron Man, to the Incredible Hulk, and Thor.  One would think after a while, their luck would run out, and a sub-par film would be break the chain of hits.  Thankfully, with the release of, \\"Captain America:  The First Avenger,\\" that string remains unbroken.    \\"Captain America:  The First Avenger,\\" tells the story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny weakling desperate to get into World War Two, despite his tiny form and long list of health problems.  Feeling left out when his friends and his country head off to war, he's offered the chance to join a program that may help him become a powerful super soldier, and help change the course of the war.  Jumping at the task, he quickly finds himself confronting what may be the Nazi's most powerful figure, and weapons that could end the war, and not in favor of the allies.    What makes \\"Captain America\\" so great is that it knows exactly what it sets out to be:  A homage to the serials of the 30's and 40's, in the vein of Raiders of the Lost Ark (there's even a clever nod to it early on).  Combining elements of war films, science fiction, and pulp fiction, \\"Captain America\\" is a near perfect blend of all three, with great action scenes, an awesome retro feel, and a nice sense of humor.  There's nary a weak note to be found here, as the cast is strong all throughout, with Chris Evans portraying a hero who has no ego, and only wants to do the right thing, and Hugo Weaving proving once more that he can play bad guys like no one else, embodying the scientific madness of the Red Skull.  To top it off, the visuals and production values are top notch throughout, and the film really does feel like a comic book come to life, with each new action sequence outdoing the last.     If I had to nitpick, the only real flaw in the film isa a romance subplot between Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter that I felt was unnecessary.  But even then, the film seems to realize the same thing, as it doesn't go very far, a fact that I'm glad for.  \\"Captain America\\" focuses on constantly providing thrills and adventure, and succeeds wonderfully.  While it does feel a bit long, I didn't mind in the slightest.  If anything, I wanted to see even more of Captain America's world, as this is a film filled with optimism, where the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there's no grim and grittiness that so often drenches today's heroes.      I could keep raving about the action, the costumes, the humor, but I'll leave it at this:  \\"Captain America\\" is now one of my favorite superhero films.  It knows what it wants to do, doesn't deviate from the path, brings all of it's elements together, and provides a light hearted escapism that the world so desperately needs.  If Marvel can keep making movies this entertaining, I can't wait to see what they have down the road!

B000JQU1VS|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes represent a set of the original, essential modern mystery story. These selected mysteries, in particular, take you through extremely varied cases that are both short enough to read in one sitting and long enough that you have ample chance to attempt to beat Holmes to the solution. I came to begin reading Sherlock Holmes through job training exercises on deductive reasoning; in this regard, Holmes is the standard. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing is easy to read and pulls you into the tale. In this collection are the following mysteries:<br /><br />-A Scandal in Bohemia<br />-The Red-Headed League<br />-A Case of Identity<br />-The Boscombe Valley Mystery<br />-The Five Orange Pips<br />-The Man with the Twisted Lip<br />-The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle<br />-The Adventure of the Speckled Band<br />-The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb<br />-The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor<br />-The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet<br />-The Adventure of the Copper Beeches<br /><br />In particular, I enjoyed \\"The Red-Headed League,\\" \\"The Engineer's Thumb,\\" and, most of all, \\"The Speckled Band.\\" For a price-tag of \\"free,\\" why not buy this today to download to your Kindle?

B004G600A4|5.0|This was the first time that I bought any kind of dvd off of amazon, so I was a little hesitant at first.  I was afraid of getting a used dvd that had a lot of scratches on it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I received my dvd in the time frame I was given, and the dvd had no scratches whatsoever.  It was like buying a brand new movie but for half the price!  I will be buying more movies off of amazon after this experience.

B000FC1AGG|5.0|If you enjoy a light, Brit-chick-lit with romance and a happily-ever-after, this is THE book.  Guarantee to put a smile on your face from the beginning. Most entertaining was the main character, Emma: she was just so delightful. Her foot-in-mouth definitely gets the best of her, and it will haunt her for what seems like infinity! But it will be one excursion that will be forever worth it.<br /><br />The story begins with Emma on a plane traveling on business from London to Glasgow. Not particularly fond of flying, Emma fidgets around trying to ease the rigidity. She is seated next to a reclusive man who never looks up or acknowledges his surroundings...he's just there. The plane runs into some fierce turbulence, and Emma comes unglued because she believes the plane is destined to crash and that she will truly die. In this hysterical state of mind she now is in, she begins babbling all her deep secrets (and boy is there a long, amusing list), which the guy next to her can't help but hear. Thus, begins the most rib-tickling venture ever!<br /><br />Days after being back on the ground and at work at the Panther Corp., the CEO and founder of her company is scheduled to show up for an office visit. Unbeknownst to Emma, this man, Jack Harper, is the one and only seatmate on the plane. You can just imagine what happens during his visit; after all, she has revealed her darkest secrets to him from her uncomfortable G-string undies, unfulfilling sex life to her pranks on her coworkers and lying on her Panther Corp. application. Oh yeah, this is where the book gets hilariously entertaining because Jack knows everything about Emma and banters her with quips of her plane confessions. This will also be the beginning of Jack's attraction for Emma, which will eventually lead into a very endearing, extremely lovely relationship.<br /><br />Love this book! I can't say enough about the pleasure trip this book has taken me on. If you just want to escape into some light, entertaining read, \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\" is just what you need to quench that desire. Highly recommended for your reading pleasure!ad, \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\" is just what you need to quench that desire. Highly recommended for your reading pleasure!

B001NLKT60|5.0|This is the second book in Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, The Girl Who Played with Fire, is centrally focused on Lisbeth Salandar's character.  While she will be the prime suspect for the murder of a couple's death, it will also give the reader insight of her past and what horrific dealings she had to endure with authority abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse.<br /><br />Further into the story, Mikael Blomkvist will come to Lisbeth's rescue and try feverishly to prove her innocence. He will find out through his investigations that the murderer's motives are much more diabolical than anyone can imagine. Hard-core visualizations are written in this story in which the foundation will be focused on murder, betrayal, and deceit.<br /><br />This book is a very captivating development to its predecessor Dragon Tattoo. The additional details in this book make for a more horrendous continuation of this trilogy...a truly compelling thriller! Enthralling! Highly Recommend!
030726999X|5.0|Larsson's third novel in his trilogy was as wonderful as the first two. You will not want to finish this book. Larsson's death is a terrible loss to the reading world.
B002VUFKG6|3.0|Well Elizabeth Gilbert did in fact warn people at the beginning of the book.. and thank goodness she did, because that made me feel a little less annoyed.<br /><br />To re-state the obvious....it is nothing like Eat,Pray, Love....in fact one of my thoughts throughout Committed was that clearly Ms Gilbert had forgotten her meditation in India, because this level of obsessing and anxiety is not in keeping with her tree hugging calm achieved at the ashram.<br /><br />The sociological research she conducted in this book was in fact interesting...the history of marriage and the Christian Church I have used in discussions with people...the look at the Wife of the mid-1900s was also pretty interesting...however the 'stalking' of villagers in South East Asia was odd, and I really was getting fed up for Felipe...when he eventually cracked and I was right there rooting for him<br /><br />I really wanted to just shout CHILL OUT to the writer...I, myself, have only recently gotten married (1 month prior to reading this book) after being with my husband for 10 yrs...I really hope writing this book helped her feel better...because by the end of it the conclusions she had drawn were obvious from before she started the book..<br /><br />While the book was not as enjoyable as her previous hit... i am glad that she wrote it, got it out into the Universe, and did what she had to do...I look forward to reading her next book (fingers crossed)
0451196716|5.0|Excellent piece of fiction that is both prophetic and terrifying at the same time. Even though the book was written many years ago, one can definitely see this type of entertainment becoming popular within our lifetimes. I especially enjoyed the various characters King created for the story, and how they slowly started to work together towards the end of the story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There are a few books to movies that I am eagerly waiting to come to life in American theaters:    1) Daemon by Daniel Suarez  2) Girl With the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson  3) Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins    I honestly was not expecting much when I first picked up The Hunger Games.  I remember hearing some small talk in an on-line book club forum but never really thought this would be for me.  If it was not on sale when I bought it, I probably would NOT of bothered with it as I found most \\"Young Adult\\" books never really catch my attention.  Delighted to say the story caught my attention early on and I tore through all three books in a week.    Taking place in the far future in the nation of Panem, the 12 Districts surrounding the Capital send tributes (1 boy and 1 girl) to the Capital to play the Hunger Games, a battle to the death of District children fighting in an enclosed arena which the Gamemakers have total control of their environment.    To the Victor of the games comes an easy life for themselves, a brief respite of total misery to the Victor's District (until next years' game), and live entertainment for the decadent citizens of the Capital.    The citizens of the 12 Districts live a hard life to provide everything the Capital's needs and wants; Food, electronics, coal, furniture.      The Capital provides the Peacekeepers to enforce the law as they see fit.    Katniss Evergreen and her mockingjay token becomes the symbol of the resistance.     My only complaint about the series?  The story is too short.
0439023521|3.0|The setting and set up is neat, but the story is very light and is basically the same as Battle Royale. I would recommend that book before this one; this is more like fluff than actual substance.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I went into this book completely unprepared for how good it turned out to be. I was captivated from start to finish. I am a twilight series girl so I really didn't think I would like this book but OMG! Give the book a chance you won't want to go to bed at night. The author had a way of making you feel for every character. There were parts that were go intense and graphic. I felt like I was there. I could see everything happening before my eyes. Its a beautiful story that draws you in. Please dont miss out on this treasure. Happy reading.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This movie pretty much split the difference for me. The beginning and middle of the movie were a little shaky,  seeming unoriginal and almost silly at times. I understand they were aiming for character development, but because the audience already knows so much about the main character, and the big picture, the events seem trivial. In the last third of the movie things pick up. The characters get a little more interesting, and the action (and accompanying special effects) are well done. Overall I'd say decent, not great movie.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very good app with accurate predictions. Flow makes it even faster and an easy switch for people who have been using swype. And the future features, swiftkey betas, look amazing.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|\\"Inside Job\\" exposes our financial sector as the greatest gang of thieves in human history. It is well-researched and convincing.

0446567337|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author.  I can feel what his characters feel.  Being an Army wife, when I saw the title \\"Dear John\\" I just knew I had to buy this book.  And I absolutely loved reading this book, so much I couldn't stop.  I know what it's like to be miles away from the person you love.  I could empathize with Savannah.  I like Savannah was attending college while my husband (then boyfriend) was in Iraq in harms way.  As the story developed I could not help but be angered at Savannah but in the end I understood her decision.  It helped me feel how a soldier would feel if he received a \\"dear John\\" letter.  This book just hit to close to home ... I loved it ... couldn't put it down ... moved me to tears ...
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Kept double spacing when I pressed space bar putting like 5 periods in each sentence. Prediction was crap 50% of time too.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A friend recommended this book.  At first I discarded this book as another young adult book at teens and soon mothers would ban wagon like the Twlight series.   But after a slow start the book picked up and I could not put my Kindle down.  I just wanted to keep reading on to see what would happen to Katniss Everdeen.  The concept of the Hunger Games is very disturbing to say the least.  None the less Suzanne Collins did an amazing job developing Katness' character.  The ending was not a disappointment.  I jumped right into the second book.  If you're looking for suspense look no farther ... don't delay ... READ this book ...
0553801473|2.0|This book is among the most disappointing I have ever read. I have waited for years for it to come out, and it falls well short for me. While the characters are still vibrant and interesting, the plot advancement in this book is almost non existent. And for me, yet another sympathetic character was killed off (I hope only seems to be), and other characters who were interesting or sympathetic receive little coverage, or are made much more boring. It was like reading Path of Daggers, or Crossroads of Twilight etc. Lots of nice prose, and new characters and viewpoints added, but nothing advacning the plot by any great measure. I was very disappointed. Dany in Meereen with her dragons is like Rand al'Thor in Cairhien, and I in no way mean that to be flattering.

038533348X|5.0|Who am I to even try and review a book by Kurt Vonnegut?<br /><br />I come to Cat's Cradle in 2011, about 40 years after everyone else my age has long since read the book, and I can see now why, more than likely because of Bokonism, it was so popular. I'm not sure why I never read the book before (not even the connection to the Grateful Dead was enough to get me to pick it up), but my guess is that it maybe had something to do with the connection Kurt Vonnegut had to Science Fiction and that wasn't a genre I was into at the time. Anyway, I don't feel bad for having waited so long because I think I appreciated the story now more than I would have then.<br /><br />My review in a nutshell, and these are not shameless lies, is that Cat's Cradle is frightening story full of wit, wisdom and insight and is a work of genius.<br /><br />\\"No damn cat, and no damn cradle.\\"
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with Something Blue and here's why...<br /><br />In Something Borrowed I tolerated/liked Darcy because she was who she was. In Something Blue she completely changes and it's kind of weird or understand/believe in her new character. I feel like the book was a little rushed towards the end, making it seem as though so many things happened without us actually reading about it.  I forced myself to finish the book towards the end. I definitely liked Something Borrowed better.  Instead of liking Darcy more in this book, I hated her.<br /><br />The book is an easy read and for the most part keeps you wanting to read more.

B000ZM1FXO|1.0|I ventured to watch this movie because I like historical films and Helen Mirren, and it featured a top-notch cast.  I'll never make that mistake again.  With no purpose, no plot, no plausibility, and no point, the film is little more than a prepubescent boy's daydream about naked women and circuses.  Typical Italian fare from the 1970s: imagine a spaghetti western where all the cowboys are nude. Or, Attack of the Fifty Foot Nude Woman.  Or, The Wizard of Oz au Naturel. Or, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf Without Her Clothes?  You get the idea.
B000000W5N|5.0|Without a doubt, the Rolling Stones' mid-career triology of albums (\\"Let it Bleed,\\" \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile On Main Street\\") established their dominant position as \\"The World's Greatest Rock-and-Roll Band\\" for most of the 1970's.  While their earlier releases from 1962 to 1968 clearly showed the lads paying homage to their R'n'B and blues heroes, the songwriting team of Jagger/Richards had flexed it's collective muscle on 1969's \\"Let it Bleed,\\" with classics like \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" \\"Live With Me\\" and \\"Midnight Rambler.\\"  Then, in '71, the Stones issued incendiary slab of pure adrenaline that hasn't been matched since for it's sheer uncompromising allegiance to rock 'n' roll.<br /><br />Starting with \\"Brown Sugar,\\" the Stones announce they have no love with this \\"feminist\\" truck as they launch in to a tune about, among other things, the joy of inter-racial copulation.  As has been variously dissected on the 'Net, this song may or may not be about slavery, or the Antebellum South, but all you need to know is Mick's fierce query, \\"How come you taste so good\\"? to understand that this is going to be one politically incorrect and rocking ride.<br /><br />By the way, this review is specifically about the 1994 Virgin Records re-mastered CD (V2-7243-8-3952526), not the 2010 version.  And, even though this Virgin re-master CD typically sells for $35-$100, whether you own a high-tech sound system or an old school Walkman CD player, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get this version only.  The bottom end that the 2010 \\"Sticky Fingers\\" CD lacks is undeniably here on this gem of a re-master.  To hear the crunch of Keef's guitar mesh so beautifully with Charlie's snare cracks at the opening of \\"Sway\\" ignites a veritable frisson of back-of-the-neck ripples.<br /><br />What more can be said?  You have two of the most significant and gorgeous Stones' ballads ever recorded on this album: \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Sister Morphine.\\"  And they are as opposite as day and night; \\"Horses\\" aches with longing and pain, yet melodically seduces, while \\"Morphine\\" horrifies with stark imagery as slowly builds its pulse.<br /><br />Let me take a moment, too, to lament the great loss of Bill Wyman.  Since leaving the band in '92, we have missed one of the best things about the Stones - the lock-step yet breathable loping thrust of the most truly dynamic and versatile rhythm section in R'n'R, now reduced by half with Bill's departure.  Just listen to what the man does in the jam that ends \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\\" and you will understand that the Stones are always only at 80% with Wyman gone.<br /><br />Finally, there's nothing sweeter to me in this dear life than popping this CD in and punching up Track 6 to hear the raunchy shuffle of Charlie's drumming on \\"Bitch\\" come alive in this splendid re-master.  Don't wait, don't hesitate, just get this Virgin re-master before it's gone., yet melodically seduces, while \\"Morphine\\" horrifies with stark imagery as slowly builds its pulse.

B005D7E7XQ|5.0|There are only a handful of movies that I consider to be the true Halloween classsics... and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is one of them. Loosely adapted from Washington Irving's story, this Tim Burton classic is part romance, part detective story, and part gothic horror -- and Johnny Depp helps elevate it to a brilliant supernatural thriller.<br /><br />Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders. He soon learns that the locals believe that a monstrous undead Hessian known as the Headless Horseman is the one who's beheading people. As a rational man of science, Ichabod thinks this is ridiculous... until he has a close encounter with the Horseman after he committed some of his murders.<br /><br />But Ichabod is still convinced that someone living is controlling the Horseman, and it's all wrapped up in a complex scheme involving a pregnancy, a marriage, a will, and a tangled family tree. But as deaths stack up and heads roll, Ichabod and his orphaned servant Masbeth (Marc Pickering) discover that they are up against evil that they couldn't have even imagined.<br /><br />\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is vintage Tim Burton, back when he was a little more restrained about said style -- everything is painted in blacks, whites and greys with brief splashes of color (BLOOD!), eerie gothic buildings, and skeletal trees. And there's that little edge of rickety weirdness, especially when Depp whips out his buggy-eyed binoculars.<br /><br />Now, it's not perfect -- the witch's hentai-tongue/eyeballs always make me burst out laughing. But Burton really infuses this movie with a sense of creeping, bloody horror that gets more and more nightmarish, peppered with moments of bleak humor (Ichabod trying to throttle the Horseman) and some really disturbing beheadings. It's a pretty sharp contrast to the rather sweet, shy romance between Ichabod and his host's daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.<br /><br />As for Depp, he's absolutely perfect -- he plays Ichabod Crane as a young man with a horrifying past (which is revealed via dreams) and an abiding love for logic, science and reason. He's also pretty nervy, fragile and neurotic; how often do you see movie heroes who faint more often than the heroines?<br /><br />Christina Ricci is rather wooden at first, but she improves a lot as we discover some of the secrets she keeps hidden. Pickering is excellent as a young orphan who latches onto Ichabod as a surrogate father, and Miranda Richardson is all spidery creepiness as Lady Van Tassel. Also keep an eye out for Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon and Christopher Walken's hilariously over-the-top Horseman.<br /><br />\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is all creepy atmosphere and weirdness, but it also has a solid story at its center.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|These headphones are truly amazing! When I was considering them I've read quite a bit about (1) how they are not worth the money without a decent headphone amp, (2) that their bass leaves a lot to desire, and (3) that they have an insanely long burn-in period. All of these criticisms are greatly exaggerated and obscure how wonderfully accurate and detailed these headphones really are.     On the first point, although plugging them into my iPod (as expected) did not produce spectacular results, they performed just fine and definitely better than what many reviews would have you believe. I have a pair of Shure's SE 535, and although I did not do a side by side  A to B comparison (the Shures broke in less than a month of use and I sent them back to the company for service), I do not recall a striking difference in the sound quality between the two when playing out of the iPod. Although, for instance, the iPod driven Shures had somewhat better bass, the AKGs make up for it in other respects (i.e. sound stage). However, it was when I plugged the AKGs into my Onkyo (not super fancy, mid-class) receiver and listened to CDs and a records, they absolutely sung! The sound stage is nice and wide. You can really pinpoint the location of every sound in 3D space. When listening to vocals, it actually feels like you can reach out and touch the singer. Every sound is crisp, precise and easily distinguished from all others. For instance, you can pick out the separate layers of vocal harmonies, that can often be muddled and fused will lesser audio equipment. I should also add that when visiting my parents, I plugged these cans into my parent's Sony \\"space-age\\" looking, CD and tape (!) playing stereo, which was bought at Target or Walmart in late 1990's/early 2000's, is now relegated to the basement. When playing a CD, considering the source, the headphones blew me away! Although I don't doubt that a headphone amp would be nice, it is not absolutely necessary to realize the many benefits of these headphones.       On the second point, regarding the bass, I could not disagree more. Unless you like your bass so heavy that it muddles everything else, these headphones are for you. The bass is controlled, punchy and tight, and does not muddle the other frequencies. It is very natural. I listen to tons of electronic music (electronica, glitch, techno, minimal, house-- you name it -- all of which is considered bass driven), and I think these headphones are perfect. In fact they give you a perfect balance of bass, nicely transparent mids and crisp highs. I've listened to Senns HD 650 (which I do like) but actually prefer these, due to that clarity. BTW, other types of music sound great as well with these headphones. Besides electronic, I also listen to classical music, opera, rock, and jazz, and I think that they sound great with all. For a while, these cans will definitely be my go to headphones for everything I listen to.     Lastly, although it is widely publicized that these cans have a very long burn-in period, I was actually impressed with the out-of-the-box sound. I did not do a dedicated burn-in as some do (leaving them to play 24/7 somewhere in a closet). Rather, I just kept on having dedicated listening session every few days, and noticed them opening up right in front of my eyes. I love them now, but I am really looking forward to hearing what they sound like in few more months!     Overall, if you are dissuaded from getting these cans due to issues some have called out online, take those criticisms with a grain of salt. If you like detailed and precise reproduction of what your CDs, records and digital files really sound like, try these cans. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B0009P66TK|5.0|July of 2011: I fell for this watch the minute I saw it; I loved its simple design, honest materials (steel and leather, exposed and pure), its &#34;what you see is what you get&#34; attitude. I am not left handed, and I looked very hard for an equivalent right handed design, without success. Still, I decided to give it a chance and ordered the watch from Amazon at a great price. Upon delivery, I tried the watch and noticed that it felt more comfortable than my other watches because since the crown and chronometer control buttons face away from one's wrist (assuming usage on left hand) so no matter how hard you bend your wrist the buttons will never limit or get in the way of your movements.  I've been using this watch for over 30 days now and I find it to be very accurate compared to my cell phone's signal-regulated clock.  I can't understand why people complain about this watch being too big, when the specs clearly indicate that the case is 45.1 millimeters in diameter; how hard is it to get a measuring tape and check it against your own wrist before ordering? Even if you don't know anything about millimeters??? ([...]  By the way, it is big. Right on the edge for my wrist size.  Feb, 2016: The watch is working well, it is very precise... still with the original battery. I find it comfortable, and the overall looks is still of a new watch, even after after wearing it daily for nearly 3 years. Just a good quality watch!
0061452068|1.0|As a reader of all of Ridley's prior books, this one came as a crushing disappointment.  It's as if the author was body-snatched, and replaced with a right-wing mouthpiece.  I too am not a pessimist about lots of things, but Ridley doesn't support his argument/position with anything but vitriol.  I definitely likedh him better when he just described things found in nature, not opined on them.

B003VDZK8K|5.0|A7X has been my favorite band since i first heard Beast and the harlot when city of evil came out. I quickly went and got city of evil and fell in love it was amazing. Then i went back and got sounding the seventh trumpet and waking the fallen which are also great albums however i think sounding is their weakest effort but great none the less. Then the self titled came out and i got that and just like every other of their releases i loved it however i still considered city of evil the best that is until Nightmare came out.     On December 28, 2009 we tragically lost not only one of the world's best musicians but a great person. With the loss of Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan the future of A7X was very uncertain. However having already been writing the Nightmare when Jimmy passed the band decided to continue on and make this album in the honor of him. They called in one of Jimmy's idols and the amazing drummer Mike Portnoy to play the parts that jimmy had already written but had not had the chance to record besides some demos with electric drums. Then the band began to record and on July 27, 2010 Nightmare was released and received critical acclaim from fans and critics alike and the album even debuted number 1 on the billboard 200 with first week sales of approximately 163,000 a first for a7x.    In my opinion Nightmare is not only a masterpiece of an album but avenged's best even beating out my previous favorite city of evil. The instrumentation is just fantastic with a7x's signature dueling guitars from zacky and syn, some great bass work from mr. christ, and some phenomenal drumming from Portnoy who did a great job filling in for the rev even if he can never be truly replaced Mike did the best he could and it was a damn good job at that. Of course we can't forget Shadows who delivers some amazingly haunting vocals and some truly beautiful and heartwarming lyrics about their fallen brother. All in all Nightmare is a amazing album one of the best ever it might not be asheavy as their previous releases however it does has it's spots (I'm looking at you god hates us) but it truly is just a beautifully written album about a group of best friends dealing with the loss of not only their drummer but their brother.    1. Nightmare (5/5): Starts of with this little creepy piano intro and then just explodes into an absolutely killer track with a catchy chorus that you wont help but be able to sing along with and an awesome solo by Synyster. A great way to start of a great album and also on a side note awesome live there's nothing like thousands of people yelling \\"It's your f***ing Nightmare\\" in unison.  2. Welcome to the Family (4/5): This song starts of with some nice drums by mr. Portony and then goes into what is probably the catchiest song on the album. This was one of the singles off of Nightmare chances are you might have heard it as i said before it's very catchy kind of like this albums afterlife. A good song but not one of my favorites from the album.  3 Danger line (5/5): wow let me begin with saying i love this song one of the album's best. It has M. Shadows returning to the subject matter of the military like M.I.A. or gunslinger. It starts with these drums that a person reviewing before me best described as like a marching band type thing which might sound weird but it really works and then after that the guitars come in and the track just explodes. I find this to be a very sad song it follows a soldier and his life and ends with him being shot and dying and it kind of goes through his dying thoughts of him thinking how he never wanted this to happen and hes hoping that their is some kind of god. The vocals shadows does at the end are beautiful and you can really tell his just putting so much into as i believe this songs ending could have a double meaning about jimmy as well. Also i almost forgot at the end of the song there is a guy whistling over some nice piano and quiet drums which might also sound a little weird but onceagain it works and you will be whistling along.    4. Buried Alive (5/5): Another one of my favorites off the album it has a very kind of metallica feel to it. With some very nice slow beautiful guitars and then with the song really picking up and getting heavier at the chorus. Then about half way through the song it just goes into this awesome solo and then becomes this whole new really aggressive heavy song with M. Shadows even delivering some of his first screamed vocals since waking the fallen.   5. Natural born killer(4/5): This song has a very fast pace and some drums that if you didn't know better you would think jimmy was playing. Instrumentally this song is really solid and it's a just a great song.  6. So far away (5/5): This song is a ballad and a damn good one at that. The lyrics are written by synyster gates and he does a great job expressing his emotions about the loss of his bestfriend and just writting a truly beautiful and heartbreaking song. I'm not gonna lie being the huge a7x fan the rev's death was devastating to me and the first time i heard this song i got a bit teary eyed. Also this song is one out of two songs to feature some guitar work by syns's dad Brian Haner, Sr. or Papa gates as some know him and he just like his son is a great guitarist.  7. God Hates Us (5/5): ok so let me start this off by saying Holly S***!!! This song is the heaviest off the album and possibly the heaviest one they have ever done. It features M. Shadows screaming a good amount and also Shads has a new screaming technique thats some what reminiscent of Randy Blythe of Lamb Of God and it sounds amazing. So yeah this song starts of with just some really nice beautiful guitar by syn and its almost just like the calm before the storm because about 40 seconds into that this song just takes off and grabs you and refuses to let you go it's intense and then when it's all done it just goes back into that same quiet guitar from the beginning almost like it never happened leaving you amazed and wanting more.   8.Victim (5/5): Another one of my favorites i think this song is criminally overlooked it deserves much more attention. It starts off very slow with some like soul singers which just fits in really well on the track. This song is really beautiful very clearly written about Jimmy. It has two guitar solos in it and they are both great but the second one really stands out as beautiful and one of synyster's finest.  9. Tonight the world dies (4/5): This is pretty good song it took me a while to get into but its a nice slow kind of haunting song with very blues like guitar and a solo played by papa gates  10. Fiction (5/5): So here it is the song jimmy wrought 3 days before he died. This song is absolutely heartbreaking and beautiful with some very haunting piano and like almost a duet between m. shadows and jimmy. The first time i listened to this song and i heard his vocals and it hit me this is the last time we will hear his voice and I'm not gonna lie once again i got a little teary eyed and i felt chills. This is jimmy's last masterpiece and boy is it one. This song is just beautiful there's really no other way to describe it.  11. Save me (5/5): This is in my opinion the best track on the album it's 11 minutes of pure epic metal music. And you know how i said \\"Fiction\\" was the last song we would hear jimmy on well i lied kind of. Right in the beginning of the song you can here someone say the word \\"skull\\" the person who said it was jimmy. As far as i know it has no significance other than they had a clip of him saying skull and put it on the song just because which is fine with me because i think it's kind of awesome. This song also has some of my favorite lyrics ever which are clearly about jimmy and they really are just great so here they are.    \\"he may be out of his mind.  But some day you will find.  That sanity's left us all blind.  And dragged us all behind.  A moment seen through those eyes.  Crystal blue disguise.  Theysay that all beauty must die.  I say it just moves on.\\"   12. Lost it all (4/5): I know its not a official track but a bonus track but i'm gonna review it anyways. This is a great song i love the chorus but i suppose i can see why it didn't make it it just doesn't really fit.     So yeah i love this album the instruments are amazing, the vocals are amazing, and the lyrics are as well for me they are what really make this album they are just so heartfelt and meaningful. So yeah this is a fantastic album whats not to love it's avenged sevenfold they are my favorite band this is my favorite album i would highly recommend getting it and all their previous releases as well and also if you ever get the chance to see them live do it you wont regret it they are phenomenal live and they have a great stage show.

B004VFYPTW|4.0|I found this cd/dvd account of WHITESNAKES', \\"SLIP OF THE TONGUE\\" support tour, very entertaining. I saw the show at JONES BEACH in New York, and it did bring back memories. Being a self taught guitarist, I have always had the highest respect for the talent of Steve Vai, and Adrian Vandenberg has also been one of the many musicians I have enjoyed listening to over the years, he is one very talented individual. They must have put their egos asside, in order to pull this off. I listened to the cd's a few times in the first day or two, and then watched the dvd twice in one night, while I did some house work. No disappointment here. If you are a fan of WHITESNAKE or any of the musicians on this set, (Tommy Aldridge, David Coverdale, Rudy Sarzo, Steve Vai, Adrian Vandenberg, or Rick Seratte, -keyboards) you will enjoy this offering.<br /><br />VINNY THE ROCKER

B000001FE0|5.0|This album shows what truly made the Bee Gees great and that they stood on their own merit of great songs and wonderful productions. This album is their Crowning Achievement of the 4 they would release in the 1960's in only a short 2 year period! This remaster was done wonderfully and even has the original red velvet cover with the big gold lettering of the original. As an earlier reviewer stated, this album definitely got the royal treatment! From a historical perspective, Odessa was such a strong statement by the band and was one of three epic double albums released that year by a British Band, the other 2 being \\"Tommy\\" by the Who and \\"White\\" album as it's called by the Beatles.<br /><br />Although never really thought of in this way, the Bee Gees were a part of the last wave of the \\"British Invasion\\" bands and were, even at their young age, contemporaries of the other bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Yardbirds, etc. This album was the one that there manager, Robert Stigwood, really wanted to be a kind of \\"statement\\" album. The band was growing up and their songs and sound, already incredible, were becoming more mature and evolving. The comparisions to the Beatles have always been uncalled for in my opinion as I have always felt that the brothers had a sound and style of writing that was uniquely theirs.<br /><br />Barry & Robin Gibb, in my opinion, were every bit the writers as Lennon/McCartney or Townshend/Entwhistle or Jaggar/Richards and this album is proof of how intricate and diverse their songs could be. The epic title track shows their strong ability to \\"story tell\\" as they take us on a journey across the atlantic ocean. Then you have songs with a country fell such as \\"Marley Purt Drive\\" to the folk sounding \\"Melody Fair\\" to the bouncy \\"Suddenly\\" amongst others. Maurice Gibbs wonderful talent for writing melodies and being able to play multiple instruments really comes through strong as well.<br /><br />This album really showed that the \\"boys\\" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19. Unfortunately, after the release of this album, problems arose to the point that Robin left the band and the next album was recorded without him. Fortunately for us, their fans, he would return after a brief hiatus and they would then begin the second phase of their incredible careers. That being said, Odessa was truly the Crown Jewel of the early phase of their careers and a wonderful album, fresh and clean, all these years later.s\\" were growing up musically, at the time of its release, Barry was 22 and Robin and Maurice 19.

B0025KVLT2|5.0|My love for this CD is second to none, yet I have a problem with those reviewers who contend that this is the group's first masterpiece and that those CDs released before it were examples of \\"bubble gum pop\\".  I would argue that \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is a towering piece of art which makes no concessions to anyone or anything.  Far from being \\"bubble gum\\" it boasts an astonishing number of styles and of great, memorable tracks: the only weak cut may be \\"When I Get Home,\\" the remainder are works of genius which must not be subsumed as unimportant or as trivial beneath the weight of the later, more experimental CDs. Like \\"Rubber Soul\\" there are no singles on this CD (\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" was not released as a single in England) and like \\"Rubber Soul\\" the album resists compromises - the myth of \\"RS\\" being their first great CD is simply that, a myth.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|I've had SwiftKey before and thought it was the best Android keyboard I've seen (better than Swype, in my opinion). I grabbed this for my new HTC Incredible 2, but after a couple of hours, I started having problems with it. Keys wouldn't respond and it got very slow. I finally removed it and went back to the standard keyboard. I'm not sure if the issue was my phone (it has 2.3 on it) or what, but I still highly recommend the keyboard to anyone who wants better than stock.

B004MNVKVO|5.0|I own a 90's remaster of this that has been through a compressor that basically gives it a bass boost, and has audible approach.    This is a different story. No compression is  present. I can't tell if any EQ has been applied since I haven't heard an original recording, but it just seems to flow. It sounds true, clear, and un-tampered.    I played this on RF7II floorstanders using digital connections between the players and amp.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Quit giving it a lower rating because it's not Swype. What makes this app not need a swyping feature is it's predictions. Which is also why it needs to read your text messages.   As far as the review goes, I have had this app for awhile, it's definitely worth paying for. For me this app is faster than Swype because it does a good job of predicting what comes next. It does take a little time to get very accurate but it helps to let it learn from your messages.   I love this app and wish people would use their brains before rating it because it should easily be 5 stars.

It worked very well and all guests at the dinner party were very complimentary. When I returned to Perth I visited my local bookshop and purchased a copy. When I got it home I noticed it was quite badly damaged and I returned it to the shop and was only offered a 10% discount. I then decided to try Amazon and am sold on buying books this way. So  much money to be saved on identical items and only a few days to wait.  I am a convert.

0553801473|1.0|1000 pages of endless dithering.  Dany has three dragons but can't bring herself to work with them.  Too many different characters doing different things with little story cohesion.  Just when a chapter actually gets going it ends and you are back to food descriptions, sailing, marching, back story...<br /><br />There is little development of Bran and Arya, both were fascinating possibilities but he just teased us with them.<br /><br />And not an Other in sight<br /><br />And the end?  Was the worst part. Made me angry. No more of my money  will I spend Mr Martin has lst his way. Good stories have a beginning a middle and an end.  He is just milking us now like Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan.
0553801473|2.0|Wow...disaster of a book.<br /><br />After the tedious meander of Crows I was expecting something back on form with Dragons, but it makes Crows look like a rocket-fueled high-octane adventure<br /><br />All the interesting main characters we were waiting to hear about are suddenly boring as Hell.<br /><br />Dany - picks out dresses every chapter, ignores advice from wiser characters, simpers over some painted fool with daggers like trucker mud-flaps and chains her dragons<br />Tyrion - sails on boats, gets captured a lot, rides a pig<br />Jon - oversees some Wildling Relocation Programme<br /><br />Even the interesting minor characters become awful. Jorah especially, he's suddenly a non-talking iceberg.<br /><br />The descriptions of costumes, food, eastern contintent cities we don't care about, endless ridiculously named characters in Meereen like Razzle my Dazzle and Hizbitch etc etc<br /><br />There was some good but it really only exaggerated the bad - Theon's chapters are great but few; the Sandsnakes are delicious but get one mention; Manderly is by far the best new character over the last 2 books and should have had more page time.<br /><br />Unforgiveable: the way Jaime gets 1 chapter and a certain character from the last book is introduced so cheaply then ignored<br />The build up to the Battle of Winterfell only for us to hear about it via a letter that is probably fake anyway<br /><br />So disappointed, I certainly won't be buying the next volume on the day it is released, fooled me once with Crows but twice and I'm out.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|While I have LOVED this series, I must say I was disappointed in this book. I was annoyed by the long wait, but that served also to whet my appetite:  \\"Boy!  It't taking FOREVER!  This one must REALLY be good!\\"  Alas, it is OK but the worst one in the series to date.<br /><br />I suspect part of it was ghostwritten, for the following reasons.  First, the language is much less poetic than his prose has been in the past.  Not only is this much more crude, with more liberal use of \\"sh_t\\" and \\"F__k,\\" those words are not in character with the people who are uttering or thinking them.  It is very jarring.  Secondly, there are whole paragraphs in which there are sentences that have the same number of words in each, with no variance.  This makes for a very stilted \\"sound.\\"  Lastly, the characters are \\"off,\\" not quite right with their previous personalities.  Tyrion was very close but others were not, and that was disappointing.<br /><br />There are lots of descriptions of marching and weather and traveling but not the depth of emotion that has characterized his work previously.  No one else could so slowly, subtly make one switch from loathing of Jaime Lannister to actually admiring him, or make one feel anything for someone as tepid as Sansa was at the beginning.  This is missing here, and in fact, some of the developments do not seem congruous.  For example, Danaerys knows that Daario is a selfish, untrustworthy, shallow sellsword, and there is nothing in the book to suggest otherwise, but yet she \\"loves\\" him (I could understand just sex or a fling but this rings false; it seems like Martin is saying, \\"This happened because I said it happened.\\").<br /><br />It also seems strained for so many \\"dead\\" people to be popping up in this book.  This sort of thing makes future reading stop, as I say, \\"Hmm, I wonder if this character is really dead in this book or will he/she pop up again?  Maybe Joffrey will turn up in the next one, married to Ygritte. How far until he just says,\\"Then Sansa woke up and it was all a dream.\\"?  It keeps the flow of fantasy from being effortless from there on, as with each death, you stop and wonder if you are being lied to again.<br /><br />Lastly, it ends with a bunch of cliffhangers.  I can understand some of that but this gives the impression that the main issue is to get the reader to buy the next book rather than to make the best book possible.  I will read the next one but it will be a library copy.

B003ZHVJFA|1.0|I should start bye saying I like this genre of movie, that being said this movie sucked alot!!!!!!!! Now When I heard of this movie on youtube (it was an ad for the dvd release) i read the comments that it was bad and that it was released 2 years ago but now being released on dvd(but seeeing the date of some reviews I wonder why it was not in wide release earlier(july 21 for me))  So I knew it might be bad( alot of moives in this genre usally are(but I did like DOA and both mortalkombat).  But this movie I did not like the acting sucked,the plot was terrible. One thing i did like was some of the fight scenes(the fight choragrape was done by steve norris(chucks son) I say if you want to see the movie rent it(like I did, I got it off the PSN network for 3.99, i wonder if you can rent it on amazon?)

0307279189|5.0|This was a greatly entertaining book! Although I enjoy working out running is not a big piece of that routine. I look forward to running more now however. The books winds through a couple different narratives on the story of the Tarahumara in Mexico, the background on ultra-marathons and ultra runners(I never realized these even existed), the history and science of running and the history of the running industry. All of this winds up being the perfect back story and preface to one of the greatest races of all time which the author was a central figure in. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this books and wished it didn't end because I wanted more. If you're half-way intrigued by Born to Run then just pick it up and give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
0670022411|3.0|I did enjoy reading this book.  I disliked how closely the love affair between the leading character, a witch, and the vampire resembled Bella and Edward in the Twilight series, some of the dialog and scenes and \\"feelings\\" seemed exact copies of that series.  The writer can write; loved the daemons, and loved the family of witches and the house!!  the house of the witches was too fun.  Delete the endless and repetitive 'love' story and the rest is a good read.

B004SCI9BS|5.0|Gotta say when I heard the songs off of the strokes website I wasn't too impressed, but after a couple more listens I liked the album. Now though I love this album of course the strokes are not what they used to be but it is for the better in my opinion. Its one of those albums where you think you didn't like it, but a beat from a song gets stuck in your head and you end up going back and listening to it a million times.
B000ELJBAA|5.0|Second solo album from the guitar wizard David Gilmour, released in the 80's. Also wonderful, from the first to the last track, but produced with a little touch of Soul/R&B sounds.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|After many years without releasing a solo album, David Gilmour delivers a wonderful CD, full of romantic (but not \\"clich&eacute;\\") ballads, unbelievable guitar tones, remarkable voice arrangements and a message of love, not so easily found these days. From the first to the last track, it is a treasure to be kept with the same care it was produced. I got the recycled paper hard cover edition, which looks like a booklet, with all the lyrics, photos and credits. But, even if this edition is no longer available, the regular jewel case edition is also a must buy!
1936719118|5.0|Books that can be read in an hour are either great or a waste of time. Anything You Want falls into the great category.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|Very disappointed in this book.  Bogged down in details that muddy the plots and story's direction. Too many irrelevant chapters on certain characters, i.e. Daenerys, and not enough on others.  ADWD and AFFC have left a sour taste in my mouth relating to this series.  What started out as an excellent storyline, in the first F&I books, now appears as below average writing trying to extend the F&I series as much as possible to cash in on its popularity,aka the Stephen King disease of writing.  At this point am highly doubtful that I will want to buy anymore of the F&I books in the future if ADWD and AFFC are any indication of what can be expected in future books in the series.

0316069353|4.0|The saga of the Lincoln Lawyer, Mickey Haller, continues, following his previous appearance as a special prosecutor.  Times are hard and money scarce.  To scratch out a living, Mickey is now advertising in TV for clients facing foreclosure of their homes.  There is in this era no shortage of potential clients, and a thousand dollars here, a monthly payout there, and bills can be paid.<br /><br />When one of his clients is arrested for the murder of a bank's home loan officer, Mickey is once again a defense lawyer, giving the author to do what he does best: a dramatic courtroom story.  The drama is there, but a little bit of a potboiler, with the reader pretty much knowing not only the outcome of the trial but what follows.<br /><br />Mickey, however, remains an interesting continuing character and we can be certain the sequel will take him into new territory once again.  The author is excellent in constructing a plot that moves forward in a logical and careful manner, albeit with few surprises.  Written with aplomb and, to a degree, the flippancy necessary for Mickey's personality, perhaps the next novel in the series will unveil more depth to the character.  Make no mistake, however:  this one's a good read, and recommended.

1461190460|4.0|Interesting book, odd ideas.  I never read this growing up.  I read it only a few years ago.  As a philosopher, I was quite interested by several chapters (10-15) in which the prince encounters oddball characters on small planets by themselves.  There is a subtle philosophical humor in these encounters because the characters engage in actions or have thoughts that are not odd in themselves, but are distinctly odd in the context in which they live, because the thoughts or actions depend for their sense on a context quite different from the one they exist in.  The scenarios make for reflection by the reader on questions like what does it take for something to be an \\"order\\" when there is no convention of obedience?  a case of \\"admiration\\" when there is nothing to compare with? what does it take to \\"own\\" something beyond simply claiming it?  can habits continue to make sense when speeded up from once a day to once a minute?  can geography make sense without exploration?  I know these are not the parts of the book that appeal to most readers, but they are illustrative of points that Wittgenstein tries to make in his Philosophical Investigations--namely that we misunderstand things when we do not appreciate the importance of their context.  This little book was published in 1944, well after Wittgenstein was working on his investigations, but before they were published in 1953.  So there is no likelihood of interaction between the two men.  Likely their thoughts are completely independent.  But it is interesting to me that they approach similar issues in quite different ways.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|This film was garbage.  Bad acting.  Bad directing.  Bad script.  Just a borefest.  Insults the viewers intelligence.  Didn't realize they dirty danced in those ancient times and had great hair gel.  Amanda Seyfried basically plays what she's been playing in all those romantic films.  She can't seem to choose between two pretty boys.  Oh what's a girl to do.  Wait wasn't this supposed to be a horror film?  45 mins. in still no horror.  Just young beautiful actors moping around brooding in front of the camera for no reason.  I've never felt the need to give a film this low a rating before, but this one isn't even worth that.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|Logan Hugh Jackman) and his brother Victor (Live Schreiber), long-lived mutants with amazing powers of healing, go from close siblings to deadly enemies, eventually facing off in a huge battle that involves lots of other mutants as well.    A lot of people hate this movie, but I thought it was pretty good.  Jackman remains the perfect embodiment of Wolverine and Schreiber makes a scary Sabretooth.  It covers a lot of ground and none of it is great filmmaking, but it provides a lively and entertaining history for the character and has plenty of good action scenes.  There's a nice tie-in to the first X-Men film with a surprise cameo at the end.
B000062X90|5.0|WA's only prog influenced album and the only one which qualifies. This is similar with Supertramp's first album with surreal flower face cover (see my review). Argus has all the prog elements of theme, plot, epic instrumentation jams, art cover and high lyrical content. Get the release with two long live tracks and this completes your only WA prog album. Much like Supertramp the rest of WA's albums are common blues southern pop rock driven music.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|In a reboot of the venerable spy franchise, James Bond (Daniel Craig), newly invested with his license to kill, goes after Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson), an international financier with very shady connections, and falls in love with a Bond girl (Eva Green) that we can actually care about.    With this film, Craig becomes the second best Bond after Sean Connery and, given time, he may take the number one spot.  Like Connery, he has some rough edges and a believable physicality.  He is much more of a rogue agent in this one, supported by M (Judy Densch) but never sure of whom he can trust.  The script (by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis) replaces the usual (and, I admit, frequently entertaining) glib double entendres of previous outings with real dialogue in a well-written script that builds character.  The sequel, \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" showed that going too far down the dark, gritty road to a greater realism can remove some of the magic from this classic character, but here they get it just right.
B00005UT84|5.0|Peaking nearly at 80 minutes, this is a welcome treat for Caravan thirsty of live offerings. All the songs and instrumentation here rock particularly the Sinclairs' guitars and keyboards. It has a monster sound that one can hear whispering from the audience. The violin even gives you the shivers plus the lyrics interspersed with the lengthy jam. The love in your eye would blow you away and worth the price of the cd alone. Don't be dismayed if Land of G&P is not played but this can be found in a recent live DVD with the original line up. So enjoy this live Caravan journey.
0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones invites comparisons to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time.  The series rivals those in quality but is very different in style and tone.  The Lord of the Rings and The Wheel of Time are about epic battles between good and evil; A Game of Thrones is similarly epic in scope, but the good and evil are contained within each character.  It is, at its heart, about power and its acquisition.  The tone is far darker than the aforementioned series and is unrelenting.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones opens (after a prologue revealing frozen undead in the far north) with Lord Eddard Stark being asked by his boyhood friend, King Robert Baratheon, to ride south to serve as the King's right-hand man (literally, his official title is Hand of the King).  The promotion, along with suspicions around an accident in Eddard's family and the circumstances of the last Hand's death, sets off a high stakes feud between the Starks and the powerful Lannister family.  Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, the rightful heir to the throne (his father, the last Targaryen king, was usurped by Robert in a rebellion) and his sister set a plot into motion to take back the throne.<br /><br />Martin tells his story in through the familiar third person limited narrative structure, cycling between eight different POV characters (not including the prologue).  Outside of Tyrion, the black sheep of House Lannister, and Princess Daenerys, of House Targaryen, the POV characters are all members of the Stark family.  Martin takes a more subjective approach than, say, Jordan in The Wheel of Time, making limited use of the unreliable narrator for dramatic purposes.<br /><br />What unfolds is an engrossing tale of family, power, and intrigue in a world where the events of a rebellion twenty years prior are as relevant as the events of yesterday.  Where other fantasy epics focus on battles and swordfights, the conflict at the center of A Game of Thrones centers around politics.  A dark secret begins to unfold and loyalties are uncertain.<br /><br />Martin has been much lauded for his gritty, realistic depiction of medieval life, and he never lets us forget that his is a Hobbesian world, where life is nasty, brutish, and short.  There is a high body count that includes characters most authors would not dare touch.  Martin also has a talent for zigging where the reader expects him to zag, and the plot begins hurtling toward the shocking climax little more than halfway through the book.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is the first volume of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, now at five of a projected seven books.  It served as the inspiration for HBO's Game of Thrones, and the first season of the show follows the events of the first book directly.ecret begins to unfold and loyalties are uncertain.

B0002IQHY8|5.0|Alan Parson is a genius, a diverse composer. He is a musical chef who always prepares a complete meal. His albums are a complete menu of love song, ballad, pop, hard rock, and always an instrumental in addition to guest musicians particularly famous vocalists. AP had successfully fused pop and progressive rock that became a model for the likes of Mike Oldfield and Rick Wakeman to emulate. In this album you have the entire course an appetizer, main course and dessert. AP was able to rehash his 70's and 80's flavor in this 2004 record. You get 4 instrumentals with David Gilmour and some guest artist in the mix. We play the game is like a sequel to 1980's Games people play and two remakes the iconic instrumental Mamagama and the legendary Raven. Just like a cook some meals may not be prepared as good as the others particularly his post Gaudi albums but still edible. In the Valid Path he cooked it excellently, an album full of pride and sophistication a first time listener would taste it and finish the entire meal. Well done Alan Parson truly a Valid Path to go Amazon or any record store to get this album.

1932100660|5.0|My daughter recently graduated with a degree in Nutrition with a minor in Culinary Science. She challenged me for New Years to eat a vegan diet for a year, or at least 6 months, and to read The China Study. So I accepted this challenge and read the book nonstop from beginning to end. I was fascinated by all the scientific nutrition studies by Dr. Campbell done with rats in the lab. He and his colleagues discovered they could turn cancer on & off with a diet of 40% casein (milk protein) & dropping it to 10%. They reversed it & the cancer would start growing again. A few weeks later they cut it to 10% again & it stopped growing. They repeated this in many ways to replicate the data. It caused him & his family to become vegans (no animal proteins), and I have to say it convinced me as well. In 3 months I cut my triglycerides in half & I don't have to go on cholesterol meds. My doctor was stunned by this achievement & said to keep doing it. If you really want to lose weight and reverse heart disease and diabetes then read this book and change your SAD (Standard American Diet) diet which possibly could put you into an early grave. Easy to understand & entertaining, & very full of facts that we never get to hear about due to the stranglehold on the media, government agencies, school lunches, the official food pyramid, & industry foundations that the beef, poultry, pork & dairy industry has on these American institutions.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|Awesome prediction, comfortable to type on since it always seems to guess the correct word i was trying to type.  They need to make a swype version that works this good.
0439023513|1.0|This book might as well have been written by a TOTALLY different person than the first two. The story takes a few crazy turns, the characters COMPLETELY fall apart and show no signs of themselves as we've grown to know them, and the last few pages just stop. There's no GOOD conclusion and the Epilogue is used to wrap up the entire series in a few measley paragraphs!    I spent every waking minute of the past week reading through the Hunger Games trilogy only to be severely underwhelmed. I just feel bad for all those people who had to wait for this book to come out. Luckily, I read all three at once and don't have to deal with the agony of impatience met with the total feeling of disappointment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in less than a day.. I was hooked from the 1st chapter.. It's an easy read.. I loved the characters.. I was more than interested the entire book.. I purchased the 2nd and 3rd that same day.. I've recommended this to all the people I work with and it's gone viral through the hospital.. I even recommend it to my patients..    5 stars!!

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I wont spend time writing elaborate reviews here, as so many of you took the words right of my my mouth, however, I do want to add to the star rating to help boost how amazing this show was and to cancel out some of the hipster/clueless commentaries and critiques made by people who didn't entirely watch the show or dribbled all over political nonsense. I love this series, hands down, it's well-done, doesn't shy from visualizations and things other shows would, the characters are all very complex and ever-changing, the film was set in places like Ireland, which are very beautiful, artistic and earthly, and the conflict of interests between characters is very attention-grabbing. By far, this show is a lot better and a lot more interesting than most other fantasy shows out there, and captivated my interests immediately, enough for me to want to dive into the book series. Don't judge by the first episode, it was stated it was the least interesting of all the episodes, however, it gets a lot better as it goes on.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is definitely next to Lord of the Rings on my shelf. Enjoy it, I know I did!
B004SKIPXW|1.0|Ther 3d effects were very good but the movie story itself was truly awful.  I'm afraid to let anyone under the age see this movie (very violent and sexual scenes)
0865479186|5.0|I wouldn't compare \\"Bad science\\" to something by James Randi, or Penn and Teller's \\"B...!\\" TV series. Written by a doctor, the book deals with a specific subject area - health - and goes far beyond exposing particular ideas and personalities of pseudo-medicine, pointing out broader issues, and educating the reader about how medical research is done. (By the way, \\"Bad science\\" would make an excellent reading-list item for any undergraduate statistics course). An entertaining, deep and illuminating book that's well worth the price.

B003ZK58WM|4.0|I love historical fiction and Fall of Giants hits the mark. I found myself swept up in the details of all the families and people profiled. It's a long book but I did not find the length to be too much. Ken's ability to weave an human tale and relate to the historical details reminds me of Mark Helprin, my all-time favorite author.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I got the movie in a timely manner and in the condition promised.  It was a good price for an indie blu-ray
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I have seen almost every adaptation of Jane Eyre and  this adaptation is a truly fine distillation of the novel. Through it's direction, acting, landscapes, dialogue, and current of emotions, it took me into the pulse and spirit of Jane Eyre. After watching this movie, I feel like I have lived the story of Jane Eyre that I loved as a seventh-grader: Rochester is frustrating, sensitive, and passionate; the setting is gorgeous, desolate, and strange; and Jane is strong, open-eyed yet innocent, open-hearted yet guarded, and intelligent. Much is left out, but novel's themes come through gorgeously. This was the Jane Eyre I wanted to be when I was a young girl.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Folder organizer is AMAZING. It's been taking my home screen of my phone increasingly longer to come up as I add more folders and icons- as I expand my app list.   With FolderOrganizer Widgets, not only are new apps easily categorized, all that lag is GONE!. I LOVE this app!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Many say the original movies without all the additional and scenes are better, but I think these new additional scenes add more to the movie and blend very nicely with the flow of the movie.  The visual digital upgrade is very nice! This has to be one of the best movies for 5.1 surround sound as well!!!!  These movies are timeless!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Extremely good text prediction. Just give it some time to learn how you type. I also like the inclusion of the three themes although a few more wouldn't hurt
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard for android right now even with the tiny screen on my Optimus it still works well better than swype or even the thumb keyboard just wiH you could set up the layout lie the thumb keyboard. All in all great app was gonna buy it a few days ago glad I waited.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have to honestly say this keyboard is 10 times better!  The standard keyboard on the evo 3d is alright but I was constantly making mistakes. Swift X fixes all of that. I've seriously increased my typing speed AND accuracy. If you haven't tried this keyboard your missing out!  Thanks Amazon and the Swift X team.
B004Y1USJE|3.0|I am a Yes fan caught between two factions. I entered the Yes world at age 11 in 1984, buying a cassette of \\"90125\\" after liking \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\\", \\"Leave It\\" and \\"It Can Happen\\"--all Trevor Rabin penned songs. This might cause anger and disgust with older Yes fans as I am sure many of them did not/do not enjoy the Rabin-era Yes (1983-1994). I sure do, but I also liked \\"Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe\\". I think it's fair to say that most 11 year old kids were not listening to Yes, even if they were more marketable in the 1980's. Since that time I have embraced progressive rock: King Crimson, ELP, Genesis, Rush, but Yes win the title of best progressive rock band of all time in my book. I now own all of their albums, and I listened to all of them in sequential order leading up to \\"Fly From Here\\".<br /><br />My first listen was jarring. Benoit David's vocals are not Jon Anderson. Trevor Horn, Chris Squire and Steve Howe cleverly mimicked Jon Anderson on 1980's \\"Drama\\", but the same is not true here. Benoit David is serviceable, but he does not have the range or depth of Jon Anderson's one-of-a-kind vocals. He also is not a primary songwriter here. This means he is singing what the band has given him. That must have been difficult. It is much harder to sing something that you did not write, and you might not feel committed to. Still, with repeated listening, Benoit David's vocals end up being fine, but in no way does it change my preference for Jon Anderson whether he has asthma or other respiratory issues or not. Whether his voice isn't the same now that he is in his late 60's or not. Jon Anderson is Jon Anderson, founding member of Yes.<br /><br />I'm tired of all the talk about Trevor Horn and Geoffrey Downes resurrecting old Buggles tracks for this album. I don't care. I liked The Buggles, and I like Yes. The problem I have with the suite of \\"Fly From Here\\" that opens the album is why did the band feel they needed to make six separate parts? There was a time when Yes would boldly make 20+ minute songs, heck, they'd even make a double album of four long tracks. What happened here? Personally, I think they should have ditched the overture, \\"Bumpy Ride\\" and the reprise and just stuck with the three main tracks: \\"We Can Fly\\", \\"Sad Night At The Airfield\\" and \\"Madman At The Screens\\". These three songs combined, without any stupid segues, would have made a great singular opening track--re-asserting that Yes is back with a vengeance. But no, they divide the song up into six parts that lose focus.<br /><br />The second half of \\"Fly From Here\\" is a total mess. Chris Squire's \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\\" is one of the weakest Yes songs ever made and reeks of vanity project. \\"Life On A Film Set\\" is okay, but nothing special. Surprisingly, it is Steve Howe who saves the album's second half with \\"Hour Of Need\\" which sounds like a classic Yes ballad, not unlike something Jon Anderson might come up with. Then there's Howe's instrumental \\"Solitaire\\". Much has been said about this track as being one of his finest ever. Really? I dare say that I like \\"Sketches In The Sun\\" from Howe's side project \\"GTR\\" from 1986 (I actually own it on cd, and I bought it on cassette originally in May 1986 when it was released at the tender age of 13). Lastly, \\"Into The Storm\\" finishes off the album pretty nicely. I have to admit that I didn't really notice Oliver Wakeman's input on the keyboards. I'm sure he's there, but his playing blends seamlessly like a session musician's rather than standing out. I mean, Rick Wakeman's contributions stood out. I knew he was playing. Not so for Oliver, and that may be no fault of his own, but more Horn and Squire's doing.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said here, this isn't Yes' best work or worst. The guys are old now, not just older. They chose to not have Jon Anderson this time out. It's been a decade between albums (that's several generations of music listeners who are just now finding out about Yesfor the first time). \\"Fly From Here\\" is passable, and does seem to get better with repeated listening. So three stars for being above average Yes.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Fly From Here\\" compares with Yes' previous works:<br /><br />1969 Yes: Three and a Half Stars<br />1970 Time And A Word: Three and a Half Stars<br />1971 The Yes Album: Four Stars<br />1971 Fragile: Five Stars<br />1972 Close To The Edge: Five Stars<br />1973 Tales From Topographic Oceans: Three and a Half Stars<br />1974 Relayer: Four Stars<br />1977 Going For The One: Three and a Half Stars<br />1978 Tormato: Four Stars<br />1980 Drama: Three and a Half Stars<br />1983 90125: Five Stars<br />1987 Big Generator: Three and a Half Stars<br />1989 Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe: Five Stars<br />1991 Union: Three Stars<br />1994 Talk: Four Stars<br />1996-1997 Keystudio: Four Stars<br />1997 Open Your Eyes: Two and a Half Stars<br />1999 The Ladder: Three and a Half Stars<br />2001 Magnification: Four Stars<br />2011 Fly From Here: Three Starsere\\" is passable, and does seem to get better with repeated listening.

B0054DFIIM|3.0|I have been with the Chiefs from the beginning. Their Brit sound reminding me so much about the new wave movement I loved as a kid (and still do). They started off very infectious and then gradually lost their way a bit. \\"The Future Is Medieval\\" is their fourth album and shows the band struggling to find a musical footing. This is evident when you listen to all their previous albums in sequential order along with this new one. It becomes immediately apparent with their sophomore slump \\"Yours Truly, Angry Mob\\". From that point forward the Chiefs turn in one uneven album after the next and \\"Future Is Medieval\\" is no different.<br /><br />I was not one to go to their website and select my own version of this album. Instead I waited for the actual release (which has a hidden fourteenth track at the end of track thirteen). This way I had no bias about the songs selected here, it was simply the new Kaiser Chiefs album.<br /><br />Right off, the production is slicker than their previous albums with a heavier drums and bass guitar in the mix. Lyrically, many of these new songs don't have memorable choruses and the arrangements are missing hooks. Hooks that were found in abundance on \\"Employment\\". In fact, I would go so far as to say that of the fourteen tracks the most memorable are: \\"Heard It Break\\", \\"Child Of The Jago\\", \\"Kinda Girl You Are\\", \\"Starts With Nothing\\" and \\"Things Change\\". I also liked the instrumental hidden fourteenth track. Six out of thirteen tracks. That's two and a half stars, but I give it three because, overall, \\"The Future Is Medieval\\" is decent, but not the band's best work.<br /><br />And this seems to be the main issue: Where is this band going? I don't know how popular they are in their native country, but here in the U.S. they remain a fringe band. A band looking for a break through. It does not appear that this is going to happen. The music on this and their two previous albums lacks cohesion and direction. They all are pleasant enough, like a nice co-worker you chat with daily at work, but you never really find something in common outside of work to build a friendship. I am actually a little surprised the band has been allowed to go this far, really.<br /><br />Here's how \\"The Future Is Medieval\\" compares to other Kaiser Chief works:<br /><br />2005 Employment: Four Stars<br />2007 Yours Truly, Angry Mob: Two and a Half Stars<br />2008 Off With Their Heads: Three Stars<br />2011 The Future Is Medieval: Three Starsth daily at work, but you never really find something in common outside of work to build a friendship.

B002ZG99TA|4.0|I wasn't ready for how good this movie was!  I wasn't completely enthusiastic about watching it at first, although I figured it would be @ least OK since you can't go wrong with Denzel!  It kept me on the edge of my seat almost the entire time!  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|The first \\"Deathly Hallows\\" movie covered about five hundred pages of the book, while this one covered the remaining two hundred.  But while the first one felt long, but not too long, this one, after a decent start, started to drag.    Why?  Because almost every moment on screen consists of someone trying to murder and/or escape someone else.  After the fiftieth attempt on someone's life, I started wondering why more of the characters didn't just Apparate (magically transport themselves from place to place) rather than jumping into a lake or running helter-skelter.  Also, if someone was chasing you with fire, wouldn't it make sense to recite a counter spell which would invoke lots of water?  This isn't your ordinary action movie, where you have to dive into the air with your arms outstretched in order to keep from getting blown up.    Anyway.  Harry, Ron and Hermione are continuing their search for the seven magical Horcruxes (objects containing parts of Voldemort's soul).   First they must break into Gringotts, a wizard bank, then escape via a cool CGI dragon.  Then it's back to Hogwarts to find the remaining Horcruxes, reunite with the students in Dumbledore's Army and fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters.    Just like the previous films, there are lots of special effects, ranging from lame to pretty impressive.  Major characters, who the reader/viewer has grown fond of, die and are barely acknowledged, but this was true of the books.  All the actors, even the ones playing the characters' younger selves, do a good job, although Neville (Matthew Lewis) looks alarmingly old.  On the whole, I found HHPatDH Part 2 a solid end to the series but not an outstanding one.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I was not familiar with this artist but bought this dvd on the advice from a friend.  I am so glad that I did!  Once I started watching I was unable to stop until I saw the whole thing!  Last kiss, High water everywhere and Sloe gin became immediate favorites on the first disc.  Joe's cover of Rod Stewart's \\"Blues Deluxe\\" is incredible!  On ZZ Tops's \\"Just Got Paid\\" he actually throws in chops from \\"aint superstitiuos\\" and \\"dazed & Confused\\" and makes it all work extremely well.   The music is excellent, the guitar playing is technically amazing and the dual drummers really fill out the sound.  The highlight has to be a song hidden in the dvd extras, \\"woke up dreaming\\" is a jaw dropping single guitar acoustic jam that I would've swore took at least three guitars to make all that sound.   If you like Stevie Ray and Jimmy or enjoy Eric Clapton's \\"Crossroads Festival\\" then you absolutely must BUY THIS DVD!  I promise Joe Bonamassa will become one of your favorites!
B0019NG73G|5.0|Gettysburg is indeed a war movie, but it is much, much more than a typical war movie.  Indeed, it is my very favorite movie, and I feel inexplicably drawn to the profound emotional pilgrimage of seeing it again every few years.  I relate to it on many levels, and I think you may too...    As a student of history, I am fascinated by how this one battle decided not only the fate of America, but had a huge impact on world history.  Can you imagine how very different Europe might be today if there were no undivided United States to come and help in WWI, WWII, or the Cold War?    As a fallible human, I am still astounded at how a relatively small error or two coupled with pride probably meant the difference in the battle, and hence world history.    As a moviegoer, I deeply appreciate how the movie maker was very careful for the details.  As those civil war buffs in the audience know, this is sacred ground, and I appreciate the care given to it by the movie makers.  Indeed, the movie used over 4000 civil war re-enacters as extras.    As a friend to others, I am deeply moved at how a trio of officers, close friends in the US Army for many years, all were drawn into this battle; when its effects were over, two would be dead and the third wounded.  And on the night before the climactic battle, two of them know the next day their units will be facing each other in battle, and are agonizing over it. Even after seeing it 6-7 times, I still cannot help but weep when one of the friends cries out to God for the fate of this trio near the end of the movie.    As a veteran, when a brave officer whose unit is out of ammunition orders a desperate charge, I shudder uncontrollably, and my only thought is \\"He did his duty.\\"  I am also fascinated by the variety of reasons the soldiers on both sides had for fighting in the war, which the movie wonderfully articulates.    As a citizen, I am very conflicted.  I am thankful that the union was preserved and slavery abolished.  But I shudder at how states rights were weakened; indeed, for decades now in my opinion the Tenth Amendment has been virtually ignored.    As a Christian, I find it fascinating and thought-provoking  how more overtly Christian officers and soldiers on both sides were, and am intrigued by Col. Chamberlain, a devout Christian.    As a student of culture and society, I am fascinated at the differences between southern and northern cultures and societies which are clearly depicted throughout the movie.  As a British military attaché so aptly observes, \\"Same land.  Same god.  Different dreams.  Very different dreams.\\"
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|Having lived in a similar environ for a year -- but with bananas and people -- this film was magical for me.  Hanks really put himself out for this film, doing a magnificent and touching performance, and I am grateful.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee Dugard spares no details; she shares all. This is a story of hope, resilience and recovery. \\"A Stolen Life\\" recounts what it is like to be brainwashed, terrorized, controlled, and deprived of basic human needs.  Jaycee found comfort and unconditional love in her babies who she was not allowed to call her own and the many stray cats who came into her life and would eventually be taken from her and tortured by her captor.<br /><br />While her writing style may not be polished, it is written from the heart of an eleven year-old child who has been traumatized and is emotionally frozen in time. Readers will need to realize that she is still emotionally much younger than her chronological. Jaycee has still a lot of catching up to do.<br /><br />Looking from the outside in it is hard to understand why she stayed. Jaycee hardly knew what normal was, she barely knew any other life and she was warned repeatedly of how bad the world \\"outside\\" was. For those who read this book looking for the reason why Jaycee did not try to escape her captors, you will need to put yourself in Jaycees skin and you will have to read between the lines. Jaycee was like a caged animal that is shocked every time it tries to escape and then no longer attempts to leave after the shocks are withdrawn.  Jaycee was programmed to stay; Phillip & Nancy made very sure of that.<br /><br />What is amazing is how Jaycee managed to educate her daughters, and herself with what little she had.  She had a seed of hope deep within that never died; a mother's love.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|After waiting six years for this book, I found that I didn't dive in and devour it like previous releases. I think after waiting so long, I felt like it could stand to wait a few days more without killing me.<br /><br />The Kindle edition starts right at the Prologue, which I found really annoying because George RR Martin gives a little foreword about the chronology of this book. If I'd read that first I might not have been so confused about the first few chapters I read. You have to realize that the first half of this novel is the other half of A Feast for Crows, so you end up reading a lot of overlap. In fact, one Jon chapter reviews *exactly* the same scenes as a Samwell chapter in Feast, which really annoyed me because I'd just re-read the first few Feast chapters so it was like reading something twice.<br /><br />That being said, it was great to finally learn more about what happens to Tyrion after his escape from King's Landing and more about Bran in the north. I think I've figured out who Coldhands is!<br /><br />The book delivers several shockers, revealing new characters and bringing back several old ones. In direct contrast to his murderfest in Storm of Swords, he goes on in Dance to prove that you shouldn't believe someone is dead until their body is being packed up by the Silent Sisters or they stop having chapters. Martin has become really good at a very slow ascent of a character's chapter culminating in a serious cliffhanger, then moving right on to someone else, driving you completely mad. The cliffhanger ending works well for linear perspectives, but when you're switching off to someone else in the next page, all it does is drive your readers crazy.<br /><br />With this book, Martin seems to be using chapter titles as a method of character evolution, using different descriptions and names for the same characters. I personally found it kind of annoying, but in the case of a certain ironborn, it did a lot to mark his progression through the story. There were several character perspectives that I just didn't care about and I don't really know what the point of it was. For instance, the Prologue. I thought it would serve some grander purpose later in the book, but I think it could have been accomplished with a simple paragraph in a Bran chapter. I found myself falling asleep during the Victarion and Quentyn chapters. Seriously, even if it's set-up for later, it just felt like fluff.<br /><br />Being that this book is called A Dance with Dragons, I expected practically every Dany chapter to be like her second to the last one and I expected her last one to end in a fiery blaze of Targaryen glory. Instead I was given a rather ho-hum ending to a season of The Bachelorette: Meereen Edition.<br /><br />The book is very Jon-centric, with something like every 2 chapters being about Jon. While I didn't mind this, I think it could have been condensed a little. Barristan chapters were particularly enlightening because he is so old and knew so many people from the past that we have only heard about in stories. Reek chapters were fascinating and Martin shows his unique ability to make you feel for a character you previously completely despised (as with Jaime). Sansa is completely absent from the book.<br /><br />While there are some truly magnificent chapters in the book and I'm happy with the advancing he did of the story, it's not the best book of the series by far. I'd rank it second to the last, beating out only Feast for Crows. Still, I give it 4 stars because I did like it.

B004P02OJ6|4.0|The movie starts with Elizabeth Banks' character (Russell Crowe's wife) getting arrested and charged with murdering her supervisor.  It is not clear up until the end of the movie whether she is guilty or not, but the husband has a complete and absolute trust that she is innocent.  He then makes an unlikely to succeed plan to rescue her from the prison.<br /><br />Of course part of the problem is that his problems get confounded when she resists to go along with the plan.  Then there is also their child, and money problems to solve.<br /><br />Another angle to this movie is the question of justice in the courtroom.  Some people have an idealistic view that the justice will be served on a gold platter in the courtroom.  This is not always the case: sometimes people get away with murder, at other times the innocent lives are destroyed.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great movie with unpredictable, edge-of-the seat action.  Definitely a good movie to watch.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I rated the product a 5 because I could make it work and my grandson loves to go for a ride.  However, I had to call the company because the directions contained a mistake.  They said the directions would be corrected but I haven't received anything.  The bar had to be installed on the bike seating post and not on the frame.  I have no worries it is secure.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Extraordinary BBC film! High definition filming makes it spectacular! It was like being there. I saw animals I had never seen before. This film kept me captivated.  Well worth any price they put on it, but it was more then reasonably priced.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|Remember seeing this movie when I was much younger and never forgot it. Still give me a massive reality check that it's still possible and becoming more probable as we live each day.
B003Y5H53S|3.0|I could not give this movie anything higher than 3 stars because its way way to slow moving and about 40 minutes to long.  Its a real shame to because the actors did a great job and the animation is terrific. But the writers got wrapped up in themselves and dragged the story out with no action to keep the movie viewers attention. The sequence of getting Dango to the town should not have taken more then 2-3 minutes, but it seemed more like 20 minutes.  Save your money and do not buy this movie until you have rented it first to see if you really want it in your collection.  I only bought it because of Johnny Depp and Amazon had a great sale for only $10 bucks. That is basically twice the rental fee through Amazon so I took the chance and bought it.  Sorry I did.  It will be going to a discount movie/book store that buys back DVDs.
B003Y5H5A6|4.0|Captain America: The First Avenger is pretty much just a character introduction for the upcoming Avengers movie, but I liked it better than two of the other big superhero films this year, The Green Lantern and even the very well reviewed Thor. I liked the fact that it was set during WWII, which made this comic book adaptation unique, and it has a fair amount of humor that never seemed forced.<br /><br />The acting is better than you would expect thanks to a surprisingly restrained performance from Chris Evans as Captain America and a scene stealing Tommy Lee Jones. Hugo Weaving does his usual good job as the villain Red Skull, but I didn't find him to be menacing enough to stand out from all the other comic book baddies. Still, he always plays the evil roles so well. Hayley Atwell, who I had previously seen in the TV miniseries The Pillars of the Earth, is not only gorgeous, but a better than average love interest. She actually fights, rather than just standing around looking pretty.<br /><br />There is a lot of CGI and most of it looks good, especially the scrawny version of Chris Evans, but thankfully it is not overused like in The Green Lantern.<br /><br />The only negatives would be that it does drag a little in spots and the hero himself doesn't have any cool powers (like The X-Men) or any cool gadgets (like Batman), other than a kicka** shield that can be thrown like a boomerang. He is just stronger and faster thanks to an experiment that turns a 90 pound weakling into a 220 pound beat down machine.<br /><br />I had fun with this one. Not quite as good as X-Men: First Class, but on a weekend as hot as this you could do worse things than spending two hours in a abnormally chilly theater.
B000UAFDP2|4.0|But having bought the laser, then the DVD and now the BluRay, this new format reveals deep dark depths of philosophic considerations to ponder. With even profound political comments too.     The print/sound are excellent+. The action, of course,   superb; the gore in BluRay pops, literally.     All that said, I have to tout a future-war film with all those elements with 50% more IQ points and extraordinary production (including a top-notch script) scifi epic that's perfect:    Amazon's product link insert isn't working today, but do look up THE CHRONICALS OF RIDDICK. Concept, art direction, production qualities are superlative. It's a far finer flick of future fighting. I've watched it a dozen times and it never fails to awe me.    Get both movies; each in their own way, top of their respective genre`.
1250004349|4.0|The technique reminded me Geraldine Brooks's \\"People of the Book\\". One chapter on the past and one chapter on the present. The present story on both books is about a female character digging in the past. Evidently, the past is revealed to us on the chapters on the past.    The idea was promising: A book about the roundup of Jewish families in Paris during the summer of 1942. Even for Holocaust connoisseurs, this story is not very well known. Just for that, I thank Tatiana de Rosnay for putting together a book about this subject. She reminded us over and over that the arrests were made by French police, not by Germans as most of people probably suppose. As with \\"People of the Book\\", I found the chapters in the past more interesting and revealing.     This is a quick read. The narrative is fast. It is like: I went to this place and I did this and that. Then I got to my car and drove to this other place. I met John and we both talked about this and that. And so on. The psychology is described as \\"I wanted to cry but couldn't cry\\". Sure enough a couple of sentences later: \\"Then I started to cry\\".    The major problem of this book is that eventually the main character of the present story becomes an action figure common to American bestsellers. The secondary characters were convenient placed and they all served for something. This is not a literary work, but nevertheless it is a fascinating subject that deserved to be brought to light.    Anyone that liked \\"People of the Book\\" or Markus Zusak's \\"Book Thief\\" will enjoy this work. Could (maybe should) also be read by adolescents.

B004BJMEO6|4.0|I had never heard about this movie before and coincidentally came across it here. I rented it and have watched it thrice already in 48 hours. It is a wonderful movie. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars as I would have liked to see less cliche lines. The chemistry between the lead actresses was undeniable. The support actors were superb. The love scenes are amazing and the kisses drooling. I definetely recommend this. I will now purchase the DVD.

0143116177|1.0|I had 3 major problems with the Ascent of Money.<br /><br />1) Mr. Ferguson made many broad contested conclusions without providing evidence or analysis.  For example, when talking about imperial Spain (1500s Spain), Mr Ferguson said the Spanish monarchy's tyrannical, oppressive nature suffocated the economy, which decreased the government's potential tax base and therefore power, and that if only the Cortes (local legistlatures) were allowed to breathe free, Spain would've ruled the world.  However, the book, [[ASIN:0141007036 Imperial Spain: 1469-1716]], spent about 100 pages demonstrating how the Cortes pursuing their self-interests resulted in an economically weaker Spain and weaker monarchy.  [[ASIN:0141007036 Imperial Spain: 1469-1716]]'s explanation was much more convincing, especially since it used primary sources, than Ascent of Money's.<br /><br />2) In the final chapters, Mr Ferguson devoted most of the word count to his opinion and few words to evidence and analysis as he discussed the 1980s financial events (1987 flash crash, Savings and Loan debacle, some illegal trading) and the 2008 crisis.  Those chapters were more anti-Wall Street tirades than scholarly analysis of cause-and-effect relationships between variables.  His explanation was also mono-causal (one thing caused the entire financial meltdown), and I haven't found mono-causal explanations to be better than multi-causal ones.<br /><br />3) In general, I can recommend 3 other books that a) taught me more than Ascent of Money and b) were more analyatical/rigorous/scholarly than Ascent of Money.  They are [[ASIN:0691142165 This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly]], [[ASIN:B0057D9RP4 Devil Take the Hindmost:  A History of Financial Speculation]], and [[ASIN:0141007036 Imperial Spain: 1469-1716]]

1891396684|5.0|There's a huge gap between what Keynes wrote down in this book and what both his opponents and advocates call kKynesianism.  This book is worth reading if you want to know the difference.  It's also worth reading if you want more than the wikipedia entry on the book.  Beware: it's very abstract and archaic, so it's a long hard slog.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I have loved \\"Castle\\" from the very start, and have been a fan of Nathan Fillion ever since my son-in-law introduced me to \\"Firefly.\\"  But what I want to observe here is the extreme literacy of all the reviewers of this show.  Their reviews are thoughtful, incisive, insightful, and caring -- and extremely well written.  This says an awful lot about the show.  I can hardly wait for Season Four!
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Like most Yes albums, \\"Fly From Here\\" gets more and more worthwhile with further listening.    One trick to more effective Yes listening:  make up your own lyrics!  For instance, on the catchy \\"Into the Storm\\", my current \\"earworm\\" has the following content:  \\"Make your reservations now ... We'll have to muddle through some how - Into the Storm!\\"    I say this because, as Yes began, bombastic 10-minute songs like \\"Siberian Khatru\\" were essentially nonsense words put to awesome music.  I mean, what exactly is a 'khatru' - an unspoken 'answer to Yes'?    Anyway, as to the other songs on \\"Fly From Here\\" = \\"Life on a Film Set\\" has catchy grooves; the acoustic Howe song is nice (NPR bumper music anyone?); \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\\" is right off the recent Asia album \\"Phoenix\\"; and the opener, \\"Fly From Here\\" is a great rendition of the Drama, after-Tormato, \\"yes, Tormato was awful, but let's just move forward here anyway\\" style.  The live-in-concert \\"Fly From Here\\" from the Drama era can be listened to on the \\"Word is Live\\" 3-CD set.

B002ZG974M|2.0|I felt it was a little disjointed as it skipped from family to family. You had no chance to get to know them. For me it was also a bit outraging on how they chose to child care. One was often left alone the moment he was born (the child who was also brought home on a motorcycle, granted no objection as he drove slow.) but wow...as eye opening to other cultures as this movie is (yay) it also saddened me more than made me joyous.    Oh and for you anti nudity, you may not want this if you are afraid of T**ts. ok? Yes, maternal and cultural nudity abounds. I love it but not everyone is on board with that. so heads up. By the way, I felt the african mother was by far the best mother doing what she could with her limited resources. The others who had it all seem to but baby last. And that angered me. I'm glad I only redboxed this thing.
B0052FG750|1.0|Yes, I'm going to pile onto the previous review.<br /><br />What on earth is this?  Is this supposed to be comedy?  As the previous reviewer noted, the only thing---the only thing---that could possibly explain the appearance of this box is the fact that in 2011 (July 3) it's the 40th anniversary of the death of Jim Morrison.<br /><br />But it's no excuse, none at all.  Yes, this is yet another Doors box set containing the same...six...albums...already...released...several...times...before.<br /><br />If this sells one copy, it's a bleeding shame and a crime.  Several years ago, the Doors decided to do the box set \\"right\\" and released Perception.  It had the new mixes, it had extra tracks(!), it had audio DVDs with 5.1 mixes, it came in a neat box with nice digipacs and liner notes.  It was pricey, yes (I got mine from a store going out of business) but it solved the \\"getting the Doors albums in remastered mode\\" once and for all (so we think).<br /><br />Of course...the Doors STILL have not released the post-Morrison albums on CD.  Still...and this is about 40 years since that.  Still, they release the same...stuff...over...and...over.<br /><br />It's well documented that the Doors release the same best of the greatest very best ultimate hits over and over.  This one is beyond shameless, though oddly it's hard to find reference to it even on their official site.  No matter, it should not exist at all---for crying out loud, they should just keep Perception in print for eternity now.<br /><br />There is plenty of great Doors material out there that covers more, specifically all of the live Bright Midnight material.  If you want a great box, buy the Felt Forum shows.  If you want the original albums, buy Perception (go price shopping).<br /><br />But do not...ever...ever...buy this.
0553801473|3.0|DRAGONS is a long book and a lot happens in it, but it feels short on major/pivotal events, either on the large scale or on a personal level. The closest things to major events come within a stone's throw of the end but they're only the beginnings of the events themselves (and not coincidentally, I was ready to make this a four-star review until I got into the book's last fifty pages). In one storyline, a battle is shaping up between Daenerys' divided city of Mereen and the armies and mercenaries of Yunkai, and it appears to have begun--but we'll find out for sure in the next book. In the North of Westeros, two storylines and their characters meet head-to-head in another major battle--but it takes place offstage; we hear about it in a short letter, which is probably not entirely truthful, and we won't get the full account until the next installment of the series (if ever). And on the Wall, the storyline blows up in a three- or four-pronged crisis--and that's it; curtain, and stay tuned for WINDS OF WINTER. (And even the cliffhanger effect of this is undercut, because it's not the book's last chapter.) In a book this long, we should have gotten the events themselves, not just the slow buildup to them.<br /><br />Counting chapters (I haven't tried to add up pages), over half the book follows the three main storylines of Daenerys/Ser Barristan Selmy, Tyrion Lannister, and Jon Snow. The rest is shorter episodes from fourteen other viewpoints, including some newly-introduced characters. Daenerys kind of dithers in an impossible situation, and Tyrion travels and travels (and is not my favorite character, though he appears to be Martin's). I was most interested in events in the North and on the Wall, and possibly the most gripping storyline is that of Theon Greyjoy (the new Reek), now a traumatized slave of the Bastard of Bolton. Bran Stark's story advances only a few small steps, and in a major disappointment, we don't learn anything more about the Others.<br /><br />In an afterword, Martin says he found the writing of this volume extremely difficult (I'm paraphrasing). I have to acknowledge that the book shows evidence of a tremendous amount of research (all this detail is not just made up), and a lot of writer's craft -- for example, there's a line casually included in Melisandre's chapter that has significant implications for the fate of characters and the direction of the story (and at least one of the cliffhangers). But one could wish that a little more writer's craft had been applied to the structure of the plot, or that a good editor with some backbone had been involved.<br /><br />Minor complaint: \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow.\\" I was so happy when Ygritte was killed off and we didn't have to hear this any more. Now other characters have picked it up, and Jon has even started saying it to himself. Sheesh.n afterword, Martin says he found the writing of this volume extremely difficult (I'm paraphrasing).

0743277465|4.0|Josh Waitzkin is an over achiever. He began competing in chess tournaments around the age of eight and was consistently the highest rated player for his age group until he stopped competing in his late `teens for personal reasons. Starting in 1998, he mastered Tai Chi, winning a pair of world championship titles a few years later. He now runs the JW Foundation, a nonprofit helping students direct their own learning in a way that meshes with who they are as people.    The Art of Learning is as multifaceted as its author: a compelling autobiography, a discussion of the theory and practice of both chess and Tai Chi, an exposition on general and performance psychology, and a primer on philosophy. I have distilled the most pertinent lessons for the UnCollege community:    Everything is Interconnected    The deepest message conveyed in the book is that many seemingly disparate pursuits are actually connected in subtle ways. A perceptive person can learn much about martial arts from chess, such as, and vice versa. In a earlier post, I sought to break down the barrier between \\"common sense\\" and \\"book smarts\\", and that sentiment is echoed here in a slightly revised form. Josh writes:    \\"From the outside Tai Chi and chess couldn't be more different, but they began to converge in my mind. I started to translate my chess ideas into Tai Chi language, as if the two arts were linked by an essential connecting ground. Every day I noticed more and more similarities, until I began to feel as if I were studying chess when I was studying Tai Chi\\" (xvi).\\"    The first step is to learn to think of our various pursuits not as disconnected islands, but rather as part of a whole, each part informing the others. As you go about your day, actively look for ways to learn x from y.    Master the Fundamentals    Although this is hardly an earth-shattering idea, Josh manages to give it unique expression, illustrating the urgency of practicing the basics with examples from his own life. He credits his successes in the early parts of his martial arts career not to having a broad mastery of many tactics, but with having a deep mastery of just a few. The mechanics behind one a single technique are often the same ones that lie behind the entire system. A big part of this mastery consists in gradually internalizing the fundamental principles until they are unconscious and reflexive. This concept is referred to in the book alternatively as numbers to leave numbers and form to leave form, and it applies to every pursuit.    Josh compares modern people to fish swimming at the surface, so caught up with the ripples and currents there that they miss the beauty of the abyss below. While there is much truth to this, there is still something to be said for generalization, omnivorous consumption of skills, and polymathy. We should combine both approaches: depth and breadth. Sometimes all we want, need, or have time to obtain is a broad perspective on a field or discipline. That's okay, because every bit is going to stretch our minds and enrich our perspectives. However, if all we ever do is skim the surface, then we're missing out on the value of plunging deeply and intimately into an art. Likewise, cultivating long-term tunnel vision on a single domain of knowledge will mean losing opportunities to see connections between disparate activities and the myriad ways in which one practice informs another.    Invest in Failure    One of the more difficult parts of the learning process is bouncing back from the inevitable setbacks and failures. Those of us with a self-image to protect may find shelving our egos and giving ourselves permission to lose particularly trying. By staying focused on the goal - improving as people, not proving how great we already are - we can continue learning. Confidence and pride in our accomplishments have their place, but should never get in the way of personal development.    Learn to Love the Journey    As important as gaining mastery of a skill is, cultivating a love for the process of learning is just as important. If we make the reasonable assumption that even masters still have aspects on which they can improve, it stands to reason that we all spend a lot more time as learners than we probably realize. This principle is so important, Josh places it squarely at the center of success in any field, saying that the path to the top lies \\"in a well-though-out approach that inspires resilience, the ability to make connections between diverse pursuits, and day-to-day enjoyment of the process.\\" (30)    Learning with Style    An overarching theme of the book, and one of the main tenets espoused by Josh's nonprofit, is to make every aspect of our learning harmonious with and an extension of our personality. Great performers of all stripes know who they are and how to synchronize their activities with their mindsets. In chess, Josh writes, mistakes on the board often expose psychological weaknesses. The reverse is also true; knowing how a person acts under stress or pressure can tell you a lot about how they will play chess. As he began competing at a higher and higher level, Josh kept notes on how he felt during tournaments, specifically when he made moves that turned out later to be watersheds. This practice, continued later with his Tai Chi training, allowed him to grow more and more attuned with himself as a performer. He was able to quickly spot lapses in concentration and repair them, thus strengthening his technique from the inside out. I have kept a journal for years for this reason, and recommend that you all do the same. As you learn more about yourself through writing or introspection, try to find ways to make your pursuits an expression of yourself. The way you play chess, cook a meal, or write a book review should reflect a deepening awareness of your strengths and dispositions.      Read the original review here:  [...]

1594744769|4.0|This was a delightful book - I woke up early and stayed up late to finish it.  The photographs are very much a part of this book, so my only caution would be, Kindle doesn't do them justice.
0439023521|4.0|I really didn't think that I would like this book. But when I reached the third chapter I knew that I had picked up a great read. I'm glad that I took the suggestion of a friend to read this book. I went ahead and ordered the whole trilogy online for a great price!
B002G1YPH0|2.0|I returned mine.  It might be a great solution for the cost.  But IMO you also get what you pay for.  The fan mount is hoaky.  It's a contraption of criss-crossed, X-shaped expandable metal legs.  The legs were diffult to tighten down onto my Core i5 chip.  It required a lot torque and thought I was going to crush the board lol.  Even when tightened -- a lot -- the Hyper 212 could still be easily moved!  The whole thing just seemed kind of lame.
0553801473|2.0|I started these books back in 1998 when I was young and still enjoyed the fantasy genre, and it is one of the few series I kept up with as new books came out. I still think he has a chance of doing something special since he doesn't follow the stock rules that so many other writers of fantasy do, but he is hopelessly mired down in his own work now.<br /><br />He has two huge problems with this series, and they are never more front and center then they are with 'Dance Of Dragons'.  He has no idea what the end of his own story is and he has no desire to write a self-contained book.<br /><br />  Since 'Feast of Crows' and 'Dance With Dragons' were published as separate works covering the same time frame, you would have thought he would have been able to take great strides with the plot, but it is sadly not the case.  In earlier works, he would skip events both trivial and monumental and recap them a in one view point.  Now he describes every event in every view point, making for an uneventful and unsatisfying read-does he realize how many chapters he has describing what Master Illyrio eats while having none about the Whispering Woods?  Most of this book is in adding some details to back stories, introducing some more characters and gearing up for the next work.  I can only imagine these are stall tactic because he has no idea where to take the series.<br /><br />  Perhaps the most unsatisfying feature of dance is the five hundred cliff hangers he felt compelled to leave us with.  Try this simple formula next time: exposition, confrontation, conclusion.  Even if you are writing a series, you can't put out a 1000 page novel of exposition and expect to please anyone. They will be even more displeased when you leave every thread of your plot in a crucial moment.<br /><br />  On a personal note, there are touches he added to this book that I find annoying.  Back is the acrobatic Tyrion after a one sentence appearance in Game of Thrones.  A hesitance to kill off his characters has emerged along with a propensity for bringing them back.  Also, he appears to back step from some of the events he has foreshadowed throughout the series, almost as if he was annoyed that people had guessed them to easily.  Whether these are just red herons he threw in along with everything else or precursors to getting rid of the mythology he had hinted at is hard to tell.  But I was far far from pleased at many of the twists he does add to 'Dance With Dragons'.<br /><br /> The bottom line is 'Dance With Dragons' needed more time with an editor. The short window between completion and publication made this book suffer, and if he doesn't have an editor that is willing to throw out some of his chapters, he needs to find one willing to stand up to him.  He will be better off for it.  There are still good chapters in this that will tide over the starving fans of the series, but it is far from what fans wanted after the long wait from 'Storm of Swords'.

B003XCVQ3C|2.0|The adapter worked beautifully - video and audio - for connecting my Macbook Pro to our Sony Bravia screen.  Great way to watch instant Netflix.      BUT... it just rolled over and died on us last night after 6 months.  The audio is no more, and the video alternates between nothing, funky green-tinted image and accurate image depending on what angle I hold the adapter.  Looks like a bunch of other folks have had the same problem and that we're lucky it lasted this long.  I think there must be something defective in the wiring, because it didn't receive any particular physical abuse.      Too bad, because otherwise it was a great product!
B003Y5H53S|3.0|Crude several times and the word \\"hell\\" was used about five times in the first hour. Not for younger kids because of violence and threats of violence. A bird is crushed to death. An armadillo is run over by a car and his middle is crushed flat, but he still survives somehow. Many of the characters are dark, gritty, gross and plain ugly. One character uses chewing tobacco and spits. Others smoke. There are mocking references to Christianity that only adults would get.    All in all, not a movie I would want to own. My kids are 10 and 12 and were entertained by it, but I am glad I didn't buy it. It could have been so much better. It's not a family movie, in my opinion, and falls flat.

This book is a not a rousing one like epl but a different tone all together. liz has made peace with her life and herself by the end of epl and was falling in love with an older brazilian gentleman. by the time she was promoting epl, she was married to that man. a happy ending? in a way, but this book told a tale of how these two tired veteran of marriage was forced by circumstances to give this institution another try. she does not shy from sharing details about her relationship dynamic on paper, including how annoying her perkiness can be to her travel-worn partner. this book did not make me cry, laugh, or mesmerized like epl but then that is the way it should be because of the subject matter and how they had to deal with us immigration's paranoid attitude and demands. their relationship was surely put to the test when they were wandering around asia, waiting indefinitely about the outcome of her partner's application to live in the us as liz's spouse. i enjoy this book on its own right and would recommend it to anyone who is considering marriage, first time or otherwise.
141694737X|5.0|I read this book as a child and was thrilled to find it on Amazon!!!!! I have been reading this book to my daughter since she was 8 months old and she NEVER seems to get enough. She is now 10 months and knows where to lift the flaps after I read a sentence! Very impressed! Excellent book! :o)
0553106635|5.0|Just read the Prologue I'm not kidding I couldn't read anymore. I wanted that chapter to sizzle for a night.  What a Series
076780421X|5.0|The scene where Salma Hayek is in the water on an inner tube:  60 degrees at Los Golindrinas in NM.  Too funny.  I love this movie. They just go on and on and their character development is great.  My favorite character is the one who was supposed to annoy me the most:  the blonde wife of the Las Vegas government official.  And, the sign falling. Great.  Just a fun movie all around, love to have it on when cleaning the house or doing annoying paperwork so those tasks aren't so icky.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Thank you very much for your fast sending and exceptional quality of this item. It's a pleasure making business with you. Regards.
0345529057|5.0|Adequate delievery time, Great price, Good quality books.    For those concerned about text size, it is a little bit on the smaller side but imo it's fine, and better than other mass produced versions.  The story is, of course, extremely good. Overall, very well written and it will go on my list of 'Very Good Books'.     I would compare it to a more modern version of LOTR, with less 'lore' and more 'politics'.
0061733199|2.0|This book is quite comprehensive and it's a great reference to have a hard copy of.  It reads a little bland, but I think it's main intent is to disseminate information, not to entertain.  I'd prefer reading about surviving in my locale as no major moves either to much colder, nor much hotter environments is in my near future.  If you're in to survival oriented readings, I'd say it's a must have.
0618680004|5.0|if you are a believer, u should definitely read this book and try to refute it. read your bible,too. be intellectually honest with yourself and if you still believe in religion/the bible/god whatever, then god bless. but you should definitely be honest with yourself!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I admire Jaycee tremendously for her strength to be able to survive those eighteen years. I found the chapters on the family's re-connecting through horse therapy extremely interesting.  There were gaps in the book, as others have said, regarding raising her daughters in this environment, and I appreciate Jaycee's need to protect her daughter's privacy, but I was left wondering about Phillip Garrido's mother who is only briefly mentioned, and how the Garrido's explained the new addition to their family, (who did come into the house sometimes after the first few years), and later, two babies.  At the time of the kidnapping, Garrido's mother was still working and later retired, so she wasn't always bedridden and ill.  The mother would have been well aware of her son's conviction and prison sentence for sexual offences.  If my son built sheds and tents at the bottom of my garden, false fence or not, and then spent most of his time out there, I'd be investigating.  Phillip couldn't have done what he did without the two enablers in his life, Nancy and his mother.  Disgusting.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Yes, I too wish the story had 200 more pages to move the story closer to its conclusion, though better yet why not the 2000 to 5000 more pages it will take to finish this. Even with book yet another stepping stong toward its conclusion, its a very impressive - masterpiece - of a book, in a series which is the best fantasy series ever. If GRRM croaks before his masterpiece is complete I will kill him myself! Wanting more is really what the impatient folks are complaining about, which is the best thing any author can hear. I loved this book. I love this series. Yes, I want more, though not to the point where I have to knock stars off the rating because it;s taking longer than I would like. This is a large book, though the times flies by reading it, and the end comes way too quick, despite it's mega length. It takes a great book to suspend time like that. Hence my 5 star rating. Greaqt job, GRRM, please keep on a rolling!
B003Y5H5A6|5.0|I have never read a Captain America comic book. Never cared about the character. However, Captain America: The First Avenger is an excellent summer flick that reminds me of an interesting hybrid of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Rocketeer. Chris Evans does an awesome job here, Hugo Weaving is very cool as Red Skull, the action is the best ever seen in a Marvel movie, and the leading lady is gorgeous. This isn't Dark Knight good. Nor it is on par with X-men: First Class. But it is an exciting and charmingly old-fashioned escapist entertainment done in the retro style of a 1940's serial. Much better than that awful Harry Potter movie.
B004N66XYE|5.0|Loved it!It doesn't matter if you ever saw the original series on Masterpiece Theater years ago. this one is beautifully written to be a companion piece. All but a few new characters and all superb. It should win awards in all categories! Looking forward to the next installments!!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|It's really different from other games; no time-limit, just experimenting.  There are so many elements to find!  I enjoyed it enough to also get the Apple version of this game to play on my iPod (I don't use my phone for games as much).  The Apple version is slightly different; it will not show you how an element was created, and it lists your found elements in the order you found them, as opposed to the Android alphabetical order.  Once you have over a 100 elements, alphabetical order is MUCH preferable!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Regardless of the word prediction...anytime you have to take your thumb or finger off the keyboard to type another letter...swype is going to win hands down. Now, if you have a physical keyboard, this is probably better on a physical keyboard. Swype is way way way faster.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I loved the first two books, so when I picked up this one I expected to love it as well... I was sorely mistaken.    WARNING SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!    The book started out ok, with Katniss understandably trying to get over what happened in the Hunger Games, but I expected her character to grow.  With all that she's been though, you would expect her to grow stronger and maybe even start becoming a leader against the Capital, but instead she spends the entire time hiding in corners and passing out!  And she goes from being used by the Capital, to being used be the rebellion!  She never becomes her own person!    Also, The way she treats Peeta is unforgivable!  It's almost like the moment he stopped giving her affection and adoring her, she abandoned him!  If she truly loved him, she would have tried harder to help him; instead she considered, more then once, to just kill him!  It showed how selfish her character was and I grew to despise her!  Even in the end it just looked like she settled for Peeta because Gale was no longer in the picture!    And what happened to characters like Haymitch??  In the previous two books, even when he was drunk, he was there for Katniss and offered her sound advise.  In this book he's just another face in the crowd.  What happened to his attitude and his humor?    Another thing that upset me was that when Katniss was on her mission to kill Snow, she didn't make it!  All those characters that died so that she could get to him and kill him, died in vain!  One minute she's about to reach Snow's house and the next she's passed out in district 13.  I found myself very confused and disappointed.  And I again was very disappointed in her character development when she voted to have another Hunger Games with the Capital's children.    All in all it was a bad ending to a great story.  I was very disappointed with this one.
B003UTUQ3E|4.0|... Why all the live tracks of already available and familiar songs?  How about some previously unreleased studio recordings instead?  I would've certainly prefered THAT. Now weren't there any?  I would think so. I mean, there HAD TO have been more than six songs recorded during these sesions ( that I'd always figuered )?!
B0053F042G|5.0|If you've read Philip K. Dick's \\"Ubik\\" - this has a similar overall idea, though of course the plot itself is completely different. Still, the concept is still a neat one, and it's nicely explored in the film.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|We love this game. it is addicting. the whole family plays and it sets up for great competition. you can even create batman!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Both Sides of the headset broke and made them unusuable. I was not be reckless with them either, only taking them off my head. I will never be buying from this brand again.
B0002EXH5E|5.0|Rust in Peace is one of my favorite albums by Megadeth, but the next few albums after that just seemed to be lacking. People compare this to Metallica's Load and Reload albums because they are different than the old works. But that's a little harsh really. Load and Reload are good, but they are weak compared to this. Risk is a really good album. It's different than the other work, but it's really good. It's underrated indeed, but my first time I listened to this I was blown away. This is one of the best Megadeth albums. Hell, I might even say I like it better than Rust. Just give it a shot, and if it helps ignore the fact it's Megadeth. Utter proof that Dave is a lot more talented a guitarist as James Hetfield of Kirk Hammett
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Absolutely love this app. Best predictive text I've ever used. My only complaint is that sometimes it finishes a word I don't want it to and won't let me change it with backspace... maybe I'm just doing something wrong there but other than that awesome! I highly recommend.
0780626966|5.0|This box set is the gem in my collection.  I adore this for the design work, the quality of the films, the extras and everything that went into it.  Quite honestly it's a steal at it's current price of just $30 and any fan of horror should have this on their shelves.  It's worth every penny.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|Point stated. The I have tried to install this on my new EVO 4g and it will not load. So..... I yea.
1451629184|5.0|This book is such an incredible story.  I am just so glad that Jaycee has survived it long enough to not only tell it, but to hopefully put it behind her, if that's ever possible.  It appears she's well on her way to doing just that.  Here's hoping that Jaycee and her family live a long and happy life full of love and joy.  God knows they deserve it.

B0025KVLTC|2.0|I love The Beatles, love them.     But... these \\"stereo remastered\\"/\\"Enhanced\\" versions (I went and bought a bunch of them) are really just unlistenable.
0515125024|5.0|Excellent story, must read.   Jack Reacher still a good guy & tough to criminal. He is a Man among the men.
B0025KVLT2|2.0|Now before you take me to task for the title of the review, let me say that this is not a review of the music, or the most influential band in history. Rather, it is a review of the re-mix/remaster of this amazing work. All I'm gonna say is, either mix and remaster in proper stereo, so it sounds like music (not a disjointed random hodge-podge of this here/that there), or leave the work alone. Anybody got a mono copy?    Unlistenable.
B0034G4P8K|1.0|I didn't think Michael Bay could make a Transformers movie worse than Revenge of the Fallen.    How I sat through this horrid mess called Dark of the Moon, I'll never understand. I think it may have been a case of brain rot. Or perhaps that is what I suffer from after sitting through this pathetic excuse for perverted boys.    Bay shows us that, with the final of his Transformers films, he really could care less for people who enjoyed the first movie. Everything about this last one spat in its face.    Add to that Leonard Nemoy adding his voice to a new transformer (quoting his oft-repeated line from Star Trek), a worthless acting performance by a Victoria Secrets model and you will have the essential Bay puke-fest.    You don't go see these movies for the story, I get that. But man - please give me something more than adolescent lusting and jokes.    This movie should have been a direct-to-DVD. The 3D that Bay initially hated, but then joyously embraced adds nothing to the experience. A James Cameron he is not. Not even close.    Pity me for watching this trash. Pity my brain.
B0025KVLUQ|2.0|I love The Beatles, let's just get that straight right from the start, but...    Who ever is doing all the stereo remastering is off their rocker. If you're gonna take the tracks and re-do the mixes in stereo, please, do them in stereo. Not drums over here, bass over there, lead vocal in the center, piano on the left. Geeze. You would think that an engineer qualified enough to remix Beatle albums would have it together enough to do it well. Sorry, but I find this \\"unlistenable\\" and would gladly return it.
0553801473|3.0|While I agree with many of the other reviewers' complaints about A Dance With Dragons being a lot of build up with no real story lines resolved, I think that most of that comes from the way GRRM split up Feast and Dance.<br />The Jon and Bran chapters would have made more sense alongside the Sam chapters, and the kings landing and Brienne chapters from Feast would have been a welcome shift of focus from the 60 percent of Dance that seems to take place on various boats. If the books had been split up chronologically rather than geographically, I think they would both have been much stronger books with a fuller sense of story progression.<br />The most irritating result of this is that Dance ended up being centered around Daenerys, a character whose story has always been the farthest removed and least engaging in the series. Her story is much more of a romance novel compared to the dark age gangster feel that marks the rest of the series. I know that Dany's story has to be folded into the main story somehow, but spending a whole book on various suitors spending months on boats to get to her--and largely not making it-- is tedious to say the least.<br />The most interesting part of dance was the Jon/Stannis story line. It also had the best ending of the book (even if it was a cliffhanger.) I really wish that GRRM had edited the books together in a more coherent way, so that we would all have had a chance to follow the story as a whole, rather than two less than thrilling books which left most dissatisfied.
B001HN690O|4.0|I guess I will have to make a confession that will get the Dreamworks crowd all worked up: while I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda, I'm not one of the many who hold it up on as high a pedestal as the superior Monsters Vs. Aliens or the movie that may be the epitome of all things cute, How to Train Your Dragon. So nail me to the cross if you want. I also have, in recent times, developed a distaste for sequels. This year we had Pixar's first terrible movie (Cars 2), the disastrously messy Pirates 4, and the carbon copy Hangover 2 (though Deathly Hallows Part 2 is my pick for top movie of 2011)<br /><br />So while I, as I stated, enjoyed KFP1, I initially had low expectations for it's sequel in place. And with that in mind, I can say I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda 2. Although it's not perfect, it managed to be very entertaining, and a worthy follow up.<br /><br />The sequel takes place some time after the first movie. Po has continued training to be a true Kung Fu master, but there's one thing he hasn't yet truly mastered: inner peace. Of course, to a panda like Po, Kung Fu is all about kicking butt, but he soon learns that the only way to be a true Kung Fu master is to be at peace with himself. However, a new gang, sent in by a Peacock who seems a ghost of Po's past, has terrorized the village, sending Po and the gang on an adventure to stop him.<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda 2 works... for the most part. The good news is, it overall provides for an entertaining ride that the whole family can enjoy. The script is filled with tons of funny lines that are bound to have the kids repeating them for hours on end. As well as the voice cast is just as charming this time around; Jack Black still manages to charm as Po, Angelina Jolie still manages to put her street tough kick to good use. However, Gary Oldman, as usual, steals the show. He makes a great villain andit shows.<br /><br />The animation also manages to dazzle. I can safely say that the animation quality has come a long way since Shrek. I didn't see this in 3D, but I guarantee I would have loved to. There are a lot of moments in the animation where I wanted to reach out and run my fingers through Po's fur, or move my hand along the cannon near the end, and had I seen this movie in 3D, I probably would have reached out and tried to feel them! It reminded me of when I saw Sanctum in 3D earlier this year, where I felt like I was actually underwater.<br /><br />However there are a few flaws that prevent me from calling it a perfect film, let alone near perfect. For starters, it took me a while to be able to connect with the movie, as the pacing unfortunately is rushed to the point where it moves at a machine gun pace. Thepacing does slighty slow down in the middle but even then, the film still feels like the filmmakers were trying to cram too much in. Also, the story seemed convoluted. There was a story but it was rushed, to the point where I had myself questioning halfway through the film what the movie was about.<br /><br />Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very enjoyable film that is not without it's flaws. I would say go into it with an open mind, and don't expect Pixar level entertainment. Oh, and even if you don't go to movies for the actors, it's still worth seeing for Gary Oldman alone.<br /><br />Overall: 7/10<br /><br />Pros: The film provides good action, humour, laughs, alongside a stellar voice cast, a terrific Hans Zimmer score and beautiful animation that would convince even 3D skeptics to buy a ticket.<br /><br />Cons: The film's pacing is rushed, to the near point of being disorienting, as well as the story could have been more fleshed out as well as the villain.I guarantee I would have loved to.

B002ONC9NM|3.0|It didnt take long to realize this is a \\"chick flick\\", with all the talking and plentiful sexual overtones, but that's not always a breaking point for me.<br /><br />Anyway the movies picture quality is very good and the sound quality is OK, though it is a dialogue heavy film.<br /><br />There were some rather large questions that never got answered which is why I think this movie fell a bit short of it's potential. One was what did the lead con-man( in his 30's) really want from the 16 year old girl? He made quite an effort showing her a good time, and his \\"affection\\", but it was never revealed why. The others in the con artists team were clearly in on the con but the director of the move neglected to let the audience in on it too! Another issue I had was the over-protective father who barely put up a fight when the con artist offered to take his daughter away far from home. I know he's a \\"con artist\\" and all but still! I dont know - mabey I missed something so i'll watch it again to make sure.<br /><br />Surprisingly the dialogue wasn't anywhere near as weak (or cultural) as typical British/UK movies! The acting was also very good from everyone. No weak links.
0553381695|5.0|Excellent follow up to Game of Thrones, and I look forward to the HBO series continuation, and the reading of books 3/4/5 that I am now reading in succession..
B0042RJWTC|5.0|First and foremost, this series is a docudrama, not a documentary, and it does not pretend to be a documentary. Thank goodness is doesn't. Showtime's take on the Tudor dynasty is in the same vein as \\"Deadwood\\", another very highly rated series produced by HBO. Other than Jonathan Rhys Meyer not putting on about 250 lbs or donning increasing larger body suits and makeup as the series progressed, it followed the true history of his reign and of the times pretty well as far as the major plots and players go.     The \\"history\\", such as it is, that could and should be taken from this series is 1) Henry VIII was a brilliant, narcissistic, charismatic leader who, 2) wanted a male heir and loved the fairer sex so much that he divorced (literally and figuratively) England from the Roman Catholic church for the former, and went through six wives in pursuit of the latter and the former. Much of the series revolves around the excesses of court, especially Henry's. Sets, dialogue, and wardrobe are \\"gussied-up\\" for the show, no doubt, but it would be less enjoyable to watch if they tried to stay period perfect to the early 1500s. Since there are obviously no photos from the time, everything must be interpreted from literature, art, and artifacts. As still happens today, the literature and art of the time most certainly took certain license with the \\"truth\\", and was even seen as business as usual.    The acting is first rate, the cinematography is beautiful (and disgusting where it needs to be), and the story well-told. Some have commented on a preoccupation with sex and nudity, and Showtime could certainly have left it to audience imagination, showing a litany of characters walking into bed chambers, and then cutting to sunrise next morning. But seriously, this is not 1961, with Rob and Laura Petrie sleeping in separate beds. The King alone had 6 wives, and countless mistresses (as did many Popes and priests of that era), and procreation to get heirs was a driving force behind many decisions and the politics of the upper classes of that time. That's where little Tudors come from, after all.      This is a very entertaining and engaging production, and must be viewed as such. Best to leave a more prosaic, accurate and up-to-date treatment of the history to PBS, which would be most welcome as well.
1451629184|5.0|A fantastic read which gives great insight into this girl's traumatic 18 years in the world of a convicted kidnapper and rapist.  Some have been critical of the book dragging on during parts, but that is a reflection of her day to day monotony as she herself states several times.  I loved it - it is her authentic voice detaliing an experience that one wouldnt wish on any other human being (except maybe Garrido himself).  Glad she wrote this and glad I read it.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I was looking for an alternative so that I don't have to watch Shrek 3x a day.  This didn't quite do the trick but my little one is 18 months and will probably  grow to like this movie. Btw, 3x a day is an exaggeration! LOL

B0002YJ29O|4.0|With name performers cancelling, the Verbier Festival seems to be getting some negative notice these days, so I thought I'd share my review here as a reminder of what it used to be.<br /><br />This DVD evidently just got kerplopped on the market with zilch publicity, around the time that saw the release of \\"The 5 Browns,\\" another thingamabob of multipiano performances. I was afraid it would get lost in the shuffle, and apparently it did.<br /><br />But it does have its considerable virtues. To get an idea of the level of musicianship involved, take a look at the \\"cast list\\":<br /><br />Pianists: Martha Argerich, Evgeny Kissin, Emanuel Ax, Leif Ove Andsnes, Mikhail Pletnev, Claude Frank, Staffan Scheja (remember his one RCA Victor LP?), Lang Lang, Nicolas Angelich and James Levine. It is to gasp.<br /><br />The string players are no less impressive: Gidon Kremer, Vadim Repin, Renaud Capuçon, Sarah Chang, Ilya Gringolts, Yuri Bashmet, Nobuko Imai, Christian Tetzlaff, Nikolaj Znaider, Dmitry Sitkovetsky, Mischa Maisky, Boris Pergamenschikow, and a double-bassist I haven't heard of before, Patrick de los Santos. Fans of the delightful Barbara Hendricks will want to buy this for her cameo performance of \\"Happy Birthday\\" (with royalties properly paid to Warner/Chappell, I imagine).<br /><br />The reason I grabbed this is not the 38 minutes' worth of Martha, although I'm sure her admirers will want it for that reason. It's the presence of the one-movement Smetana sonata, of which I used to possess a score back in my undegraduate days. (Chris O'Riley also featured this on an episode of \\"From the Top\\" a few weeks ago.) Gottschalk's \\"L'Union,\\" in an eight-piano edition, also makes an appearance here.<br /><br />The Good: This DVD has performances by nine major pianist-musicians, plus Lang Lang, and a string section to die for. It has actual music, complete works yet, by Bach, Mozart, Smetana, and Gottschalk. None of your pop fluff here! And if this sort of thing is important to you, it has four bona-fide musical babes, namely Argerich, Chang, Imai, and Hendricks.<br /><br />The Not-So-Good: These first-rate musicians all appear to be over 25, so they lose the \\"cuteness\\" factor contest, in this mad world where youth often seems to be prized well over experience. Barbara Hendricks, though still adorable, is no longer quite the lovely wisp I met twenty-five years ago. And the lighting appears to be blackness with spotlight on the performers, which gets fatiguing after a while. And some of the items (Wagner \\"Walk&uuml;renritt,\\" R-K \\"Fumblebee,\\" etc.) are a mess instead of music.<br /><br />Still, I loved hearing Kissin and Argerich in the Mozart K. 521, definitely the highlight of the whole concert; it's almost too bad in a way that it was placed first, because none of the rest of the program comes quite up to that level. The JS Bach concerto (for four keyboards after Vivaldi) is solidly, if non-HIPly, done.<br /><br />I have plenty of catty observations. The first is that any rock- or pop-aficionado who thinks that classical musicians all look alike, or perform alike, should see this DVD, because they don't, and they were all still having a grand old time. Naturally, since they all consented to be seen, I'd make just a few little recommendations:<br /><br />Kissin should either let that 'stache grow out, or get it waxed already. Here it looks like a mistake (and it probably is). As for his 'fro, well, Levine has a bigger one, but Maisky has them both beat, no contest!

B000K7VHPU|5.0|This movie will hold your interest from beginning to end.  In fact, you will want to watch it many times because there are so many twists that you can't possibly get them all in just one viewing.  Every scene is vitally important.  Best European movie I have ever seen.
B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|I've been a fan of seether ever since i heard fine again and i've gotten all their albums my two favorites being this and karma and effect they really hit their peak in karma and effect but as far as raw emotion this album has it all, it's not quite as fine tuned as some of their later offerings but still in my cd player after seven years!
1423113381|4.0|Interesting from the start, enjoyed the characters and how the author put in a lot of real facts about Egypt. I didn't want to put it down.
B005869U6G|4.0|i've been a fan of incubus for well over a decade now and i was really dissappointed with their last release which was essentially live only tracks recorded and a greatest hits cd. This cd is exactly what momuments and melodies should have been new material. It's not all fantastic but it is very good for the most part. If you are a fan of incubus' harder stuff look elsewhere you won't find it here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this book because I had heard about the upcoming film. Immediately I felt connected to the characters, and the more dire their situations got the more connected I felt. Suzanne's writing is so descriptive and wonderful. It is completely immersive. You don't have to imagine what the world of \\"The Hunger Games\\" is like because you automatically feel like you are there watching everything the way the characters are living it. The more I read it the more excited I got for the film because there is so much detail to work with. Your heart breaks for these characters and you want to join in their fight. Although it is considered a young adult novel I am 22 and I think this book is great for teens and adults of all ages. If you want a book with action, adventure, and raw emotion this is a great read (as well as the next two in the series).
B004SGWYW4|5.0|This show is good for all those Zombie fans out there. Unlike some reviews, I honestly don't think that the fan service in this anime is all that bad. I mean, who wants to see women jumping off building while wearking metal skirts that don't move with the wind lol.<br /><br />Obviously, it's a zombie outbreak type of show. But there's also an underlying Harem concept. Other than the 2 main guys, the rest of the cast is made up of overly developed high school girls....and one teacher. It has something for everyone: The Otaku gun nut, the martial arts expert, the genius, the helpless & hopeless nurse, & let's not forget the hapless couple. Oh, I forgot to mention the little kid (loli) added for cuteness. All this on top of the massive amount of zombies, blood, gore, guns & F'ed up nonsense. There's a lot of \\"WTF,\\" comedy & \\"Too close for comfort\\" moments. This anime was one of the few zombie/horror shows that really had my heart going because I didn't want to see my favorite character(s) get hurt or die. Most will like it, some won't mainly due to the fan service. But overall, it's good.
B001FB5634|5.0|When hope is gone, civilization no longer exists, and humanity has been reduced to primal instincts, what is left? Suicide or the need to keep moving for the \\"good guys\\"; predation for the \\"bad\\". This film is not \\"Mad Max\\" or \\"The Beach\\". What a father and son know, is barely able to keep them alive from what has grown out an ashen, dying world. The film is singular presentation of the leaden plod to oblivion deflected mercilessly by adrenaline laced terror. It is not easy to watch or easy to let go of when it concludes.

Jacob's family is very wealthy, and i'm not really sure why that's important. i have zero indicators as to why Jacob is some social outcast, but i guess we just roll with that. and then later, Jacob has a very brief encounter with two townies who treat him like crap. i didn't understand the purpose behind that, other than perhaps to illustrate Jacob as an outsider. maybe there's a series coming and the groundwork was laid for these characters...i don't know.<br /><br />one thing i really did like about this book was the mythology behind it all. once you find out what Jacob's gramps was talking about, things start to fall into perspective. we see the many sides of human nature highlighted and explored in the second half of the novel. we see those who are perfectly content with their place in life. we see those who want more, we see those who hunger endlessly for more, and we see those who have no idea at all what to do with the lot they've drawn in life - all thrown into one supernatural melting pot.<br /><br />if you're looking for a spooky read with a solid narrative and creative incorporation of photographs and a new breed of speculative fiction, this book is for you. plus, i just saw that EW listed in in their must list this week so that's pretty neato.<br /><br />fave quote: \\"I had just come to accept that my life would be rather ordinary when extraordinary things began to happen.\\" (8)<br /><br />fix er up: i just could not fall into rhythm with this book. sometimes i had to force myself to read it and other times i was looking forward to it. could be a case of right book, wrong time - or it could be that i didn't connect with this emotionally.or these characters...i don't know.    one thing i really did like about this book was the mythology behind it all. once you find out what Jacob's gramps was talking about, things start to fall into perspective. we see the many sides of human nature highlighted and explored in the second half of the novel. we see those who are perfectly content with their place in life. we see those who want more, we see those who hunger endlessly for more, and we see those who have no idea at all what to do with the lot they've drawn in life - all thrown into one supernatural melting pot.    if you're looking for a spooky read with a solid narrative and creative incorporation of photographs and a new breed of speculative fiction, this book is for you. plus, i just saw that EW listed in in their must list this week so that's pretty neato.    fave quote: \\"I had just come to accept that my life would be rather ordinary when extraordinary things began to happen.\\" (8)    fix er up: i just could not fall into rhythm with this book. sometimes i had to force myself to read it and other times i was looking forward to it. could be a case of right book, wrong time - or it could be that i didn't connect with this emotionally.
B004LWZW24|4.0|Pretty good for what has been coming out lately. The PG-13 rating allows for a fair amount of shock terror, but there are some portions of the film that are meant to be heartwarming. The film looks great, the acting is not horrible, and some comedy is introduced. It is kind of a mash up of other films. Nothing new was brought to the table in Insidious, but it is definitely worth watching once.
B0007TKNII|2.0|I still remember with a sense of awe seeing \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" in London in 1992.  I'll never forget the way the Phantom appeared through the mirror to Christine and the brilliant staging of their descent into a labyrinth under the opera house.<br /><br />But I really found this movie impossible to watch.  The leads are all pretty or handsome and the staging is lavish.  But it just didn't ring true.  I felt that it was so very obvious that the actors and actresses weren't really singing in the moments I was watching them but were just being dubbed.<br /><br />This surprises me because I did like and watch the movie \\"Chicago\\" despite having seen and loved the musical.  Maybe it's because the movie version had some serious star power while \\"Phantom\\" has a bunch of unknowns.<br /><br />In the end, I suppose \\"to each his or her own,\\" but I can't help but think the movie is a pale and most inadequate copy of the musical.
B004G6009K|5.0|Review of the 3D blu-ray version. (came in a combo pack).     Story... as other review indicate. This needs lots of explanation for kids about what mother Gothel does, why she is bad and abusive, and why Rapunzel is so confused.    Picture quality... overall very good. The 3D works great. Scenes like the ducking pub are really well rendered, as expected for a movie that came out 3D in theaters.       I had multiple glitches (small blocks in part of the screen that were garbage, but the rest of the screen was good adn 3D was still good) when playing, including a total picture and sound freeze where I had to fast forward a little. I do not know if they are from my disc (looks perfectly fine and is brand new obviously) or from my player (Panasonic something 300). I will check it out, and if not from my player, I will return the discs to get it exchanged (same movie of course).
B004I8WD7S|4.0|Got this protective case for my wife who is a brutal critic of all things, so assigning it 4 stars says a lot about this product.  The cover is snug and the grip as good as can be without creating problems when inserting in or removing your iPhone from your pocket.  There are similar products with better grip ([[ASIN:B003Y74KCK AmazonBasics Silicone Case for AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4 (White)]], but the better the grip, the worse the pocket friction.  This product has just the right balance.    The film was applied immediately with the case, and after a few months performs the same as the like Apple product.  You have to be patient when applying the film to avoid bubbles.  My wife wasn't, and has lived with a couple of them with little concern.    She likes the product and is quite happy with hit.  She hasn't dropped the phone yet to comment on the protection aspect of the cover, and we hope she will have no further comments following this post.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|A pill that allows you to use the full 100% of your brain is the very fun idea that Limitless mostly uses to make a fun thriller. The script is smart, but could have been a little more tight. The acting Bradly Cooper gives is very charming and smart. This movie truly felt like a \\"Roller Coaster\\" The directing is fast and pulls you straight in and dosent let you go till the last moment. The directing was the best part. In the moments he isn't using the pill the movie has a grimy bleak feel, but when he is on the pill its very lively and colorful. In the end the movie has great directing that showed me new and different things, acting that was good, and a script that while flawed keeps you on the edge of your seat. With a tighter script this could have been amazing, but its still a fun movie worth a look.
1594744769|5.0|I read several articles about this book before I read it.  Every one I read made it sound very good, if not a little weird.  I CANNOT handle scary books, so I was a little hesitant to read this one.  One review assured that it was not scary.  I am so glad that I took them at their word!    Some of the pictures are rather creepy, but it adds to the experience.  I don't know that Miss Peregrine would have been as exciting without them.  The story takes you where you don't think it will.  It is very well written, with a prose that reminds me of a much more established author, and I was very impressed that this was his first novel.  All in all I think all ages will enjoy it.
B004LWZW2E|4.0|Insidious is a movie that blends many different types of horror movies. It works for the most part. The movie is about a coupel with two kids, one of the kids goes into a coma. The doctors don't know when he will come out so they take him home only to have creepy events happen in their house. They come to find its not the house that haunted. The film starts slow with a very tense feel to it and this tone stays with the whole film. The director (James Wan) really builds suspense. The soundtrack whilst does have an orchestra at times, uses mostly organic sounds to give the movie a heartbeat one example there is a grandfather clock that has a beat that builds more suspense than orchestras.The acting is strong and believable. The movie is one of a new trend of horror movies that has a very low budget, making the director use his imagination. Paranormal Activity started this popular trend and Insidious borrows form the feel of it. After 30 minutes of this, the movie switches from the Paranormal Activity routes to a more original feel that many may be lost on, but It gives the movie a fresh take and separates it from other house haunting movies. The movie is a rare PG-13 movie that people enjoyed. It has zero gore, but replaces it with many well built jump scares. With a little more development in the last act this movie could have been amazing, but I still enjoyed it and it made me jump a few times which I hardly do.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I used to own the original SwiftKey until I \\"upgraded\\" to Swiftkey X on Thursday (when it was the free App of the day). I own a Thunderbolt and was having issues with the keyboard not working when using email. Yesterday, there was an update for SwiftKey X that was supposed to remedy this. I proceeded to do the update through Amazon App. The email \\"keyboard\\" is working fine, but now it shows Swiftkey 1.1.91 (the ORIGINAL swiftkey, NOT Swiftkey X 2.0.5.120)?? Did it \\"downgrade\\" me?? BTW, when working right, the keyboard is awesome.

0805209999|5.0|I read \\"The Trial\\" when I was in my early teens and I still haven't found a book that I have found more significant. I have tried reading authors considered in the same vein as Kafka, like Walser (beautifully crafted prose, but lacking purpose) or Pelevin (entertaining, but gimmicky), and none are a match. Even within Kafka's scattered body of work this is the best he produced.<br /><br />I never understood why people peg Kafka as a surrealist. I don't think people who claim this understood what they read. He writes about our bondage to social norms, how we are enslaved by them, and about power structures in human relationships. It's easy to understand this, when we read the \\"letter\\" he wrote to his father, a domineering personality, who had such a devastating influence in Kafka's life. Sure enough, many of the settings in his stories are exaggerated or have a supernatural element to them, but the absurdity of every day life is real and true.<br /><br />There are critics who give Kafka's works a Jewish interpretation, which is fine and probably makes sense, given that Kafka was Jewish. But I'm not Jewish, and when I first read this as an adolescent at the beach (the perfect place to read Kafka), I completely related to preposterous situations which K. -- the story's protagonist -- was faced with, and his inability to react to them, trapped as he was in the \\"must-do's\\" of conventional society. This is completely universal, and that's the hallmark of great works. While he attempts to struggle at first, by the end of the book, K. has been lulled into indifference, surrendering the control of his own life. Charged with some unspecified crime, he allows himself to be driven through a trial over which he has no grasp, and in reality, there is no escaping the sentence. If you examine your life, or perhaps even the lives of those around you, you may reach the unsettling conclusion that this is a true-to-life story about everyone you know.
B001TH16DI|4.0|The transfers for these films look better than anything we've ever gotten on DVD - they aren't perfect (with the possible exception of Wrath of Khan), but if you're a Trekkie with Blu, this is a must.

B00518HBD0|1.0|3 Doors Down is a highly talented band capable of crafting good songs but in dire need of a change in direction.   \\"Time of My Life\\" is a major disappointment from this fan who appreciates their work and has seen this band perform multiple times.    The same two song archetypes are basically repeated ad nauseum.   3 Doors Down are the kings of the slow anthem with the rising chorus.  Examples include \\"Heaven\\", \\"When You're Young\\", \\"Back to Me\\" and the anemic poor choice for lead single \\"What's Left\\".   Problem is, these songs vary from each other so minutely that you could almost intersperse sections from each into a single track without realizing they originated from different parents.  These cannot compete with their older and better cousins, such as \\"Here Without You\\" or \\"Here By Me\\".      The other familiar 3 Doors Down pattern is the unthreatening, mid-tempo rock song such as \\"On the Run\\" and sound-alikes \\"Every Time You Go\\" and \\"Round and Round\\".  \\"Race for the Sun\\" teases you with an all too brief guitar solo, effectively dampened by the droning of the rhythm section. \\"My Way\\" tosses in a dash of vocal effects, but this is like adding a mere ten granules of salt to your mashed potatoes.  Their compositions just fade into the background like the tepid \\"She is Love.\\"      The sole exception is the song \\"Believer\\" which shows that this band can indeed branch out when they try.    I would love to see what a different producer would have done with these tracks.   I disagree with bassist Todd Harrell's pride in being a \\"no frills\\" band.  3 Doors Down, you know how to write a song, but please give your listeners some variation in your sonic landscape.    I'll take anything - a jacked up bass line, a vocal duet, energetic guitar riffs, some rawer vocals, different drumming techniques....hell, even a horn section!  Otherwise you will be denigrated to becoming a \\"no thrills\\" band.     I defy anyone to listen to the full songs or clips end-to-end without glazing over.Such a shame!  This is the band capable of so much more (see \\"Citizen Soldier\\", \\"Duck and Run\\" and \\"Kryptonite\\").  Evolve or fade away.
0553801473|5.0|A Dance with Dragons was fantastic!  Not once did I feel like the plot moved too slowly for my taste, even though some of my favorite characters were barely in this installment of the series.  GRRM added more depth to a couple of characters that had in the past been too 2-dimensional.  Yes, the storylines that are still unresolved are frustrating, but they will keep me waiting for the next book.

Come on, people, in 2012, do we really need such a slutty movie to help \\"liberate\\" from repression. It's all been done. To death. And better.<br /><br /> I'm not someone who just doesn't like deep, unpleasant themes in films. This film had nothing deep or meaningful about it.<br />Want meaningful violence? Watch Last of the Mohicans. Want meaningful analysis of mental illness? Watch A Beautiful Mind. Want an actual transformation of a character who is feverishly pursuing perfection of some sort? Watch The King's Speech.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I am one of those Yes fans who loved the more commercial oriented Drama album. I love the Trevor Rabin years as well. The star of this album is in many ways Trevor Horn. The production is flawless! This more then makes up for the last two Asia albums. Fly From Here blows the last two Asia albums away. The new lead singer sounds like Jon Anderson mixed with Trevor Horn. Excellent album. If you like the more commercial oriented years of Yes, from Drama to Rabin era Talk, then you will love this gem.

Perhaps this version of yes will be here for a while in which i am glad. The DRAMA c.d. is one of the most hard rocking PROG pieces of music ever. Steve Howe picks up right where he left off on DRAMA, on the FLY FROM HERE c.d. I did notice that Alan Whites drums are a-little bit sub-dewed in the mix but hopefully if another c.d. will follow it will be out in the open more. Now lets see if they will do a tour of this new music and release a companion c.d. with some proper LIVE DRAMA CUTS...

B000FVE3A2|5.0|Oh my gosh, when I pulled this watch out of the box I was just flat out amazed by how it felt.  The fit, finish, feel, and quality of this watch is amazing!  I have wanted a Rolex Submariner or Sea Dweller for quite a few years now, thanks to this watch I no longer want one.  I have held a Sea Dweller in my hand before and if memory serves me right, this watch not only weighs about the same but feels the same.  If I had my eyes closed and put on the Sea Dweller and this watch, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  With my eyes open I swear the two watches are very similar.  With the Sea Dweller costing over ten grand, I could buy me a car with the money I saved and still be just as happy with the watch.  No, it's not a Rolex, but if you strip the name off the two watches they are virtually identical.  Of course this does not have a saphire crystal or a Swiss movement but without the name is a Rolex worth ten grand more than this watch?  No way.<br /><br />I love this watch so much I felt a little sad when I took it off.  I'm contemplating sleeping with it on.  It's so awesome that I just ordered the blue version of this watch.  Maybe I'll buy a car with the money I saved or something.  I'm so happy I bought this and not the Rolex.  Of course if I was filthy rich then I'd buy the Rolex, but when you consider the oppurtunity cost and my income level, this watch is the king of value.<br /><br />I was worried about some negative reviews I've seen of Invicta watches.  However, this watch is absolutely perfect.  Not a single flaw or problem I can see.  It feels so good in my hand and on my wrist, I can't stop looking at it.<br /><br />Just be very careful when sizing the band, the links are real hard to take out if you don't have proper tools.  I used a stiff wire and a pair of pliers.  I slipped a few times and scratched the side of the links, but those are on links I removed so the scratches aren't a problem.  Also I've read some reports about the accuracy of the watch being off by 20 seconds or so per day.  I haven't had the watch long enough to tell how off it is, but it can be adjusted to be more accurate.  There is a little bar inside the watch which you can have regulated by a jeweler or do it yourself.  There is guides online on how to regulate an automatic watch if you are the do it yourselfer type.<br /><br />Get this watch, you won't be sorry.  It is heavy but I like the weight.  It's a real man's watch for well under 10 grand.20 seconds or so per day.  I haven't had the watch long enough to tell how off it is, but it can be adjusted to be more accurate.

0765324849|3.0|*Will Contain  Slight Spoilers*<br /><br />\\"Bioshock Rapture\\" is essentially what the front and back cover dictates: the rise and fall of Rapture. This book was a worthwhile welcome to the game's major success and is pretty much what most fans wanted to read: a prequel rich in background information about the characters in the game and how their decisions and actions brought them to their eventual end. The book not only has this, but it also has 100 pages worth of backstory detailing how Rapture was built. With the book being 430 pages, there could be room for a decent story.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Rapture\\" comes in the insane amount of POVs, which damage the overall impact that some of these characters have on the story as well as the impact they might've had on the readers. These are the POVs, and are not in any chronological order:<br /><br />Sullivan<br />Andrew Ryan<br />Bill McDonagh<br />Frank Fontaine<br />Stanley Poole<br />Tenenbaum<br />Sofia Lamb<br />Steinman<br />Rupert Mudge<br />Sam Lutz<br />Simon Wales<br />Martin Finnegan<br />Diane McClintock<br />Elaine McDonagh<br /><br />That is a lot of characters, with Bill McDonagh taking up more than half the POVs in the entire book. Most of the characters, like Sam Lutz or Elaine McDonagh, have only one POV, while others have POVs so insignificant that they were much better off removed from the story entirely. It all boils down to personal tastes when it comes to these POVs. The problem is that they are barely developed, with exception of Bill, who is the only character with decent amount of character development. It probably has to do with the fact that Bill has 36 segments told through his perspective.<br /><br />On top of that, the book has twenty chapters with each chapter being split into POV breaks with locations and a year. From 1945 to 1959, this book also has to tie in all of these events together and not once did it have the feeling that such a long amount of time has passed. The characters don't seem to age nor change in their viewpoints and seem rather settled into their roles and stay that way throughout, with the exception of slight changes.<br /><br />Another problem with this book is the convoluted explanations that make certain events sound way too complicated then they have to be. One of the more annoying ones would be how Frank Fontaine discovered that Ryan was building a city at the bottom of the sea. There are tons of undercover cops and detectives trying to figure out what Ryan is doing, yet Fontaine is able to figure it all out by pretending to be a cop and interrogating one of Ryan's crew members. Wouldn't it have been simpler, and perhaps better, if Fontaine was just another smuggler selling supplies to Rapture?<br /><br />There were some rather enjoyable parts in this novel, like the odd relationship between Tenenbaum and Fontaine and the one between Sander Cohen and Martin Finnegan. Too bad they were very quickly brushed aside to make room for other events that weren't of much impact. The ending itself leaves much to be desired, as it felt more like a very forced happy ending then something that naturally happened.<br /><br />In all, I would say it's an average video game novel with some rises that make it a worthwhile read. The characters do feel like the ones in the game; Ryan does play to his ideals (even though his dialogue veers into the cheesy sometimes). Cohen and oddly McClintock had some interesting quirks that kept the book going. The relationship between Bill and Ryan is there, but could've benefited from a much stronger relationship. Fans might like this for what it was trying to be, others would like it simply for being a Bioshock novel, while others might absolutely hate it. For those who aren't fans though, the book might not be too hard to understand since it really spells out the events, regardless of the large amount of POVs.<br /><br />[I decided to give the story 3 stars, even though I felt like giving it half a star more. Its between an OK/Good for me because it wasn't all bad.]
B00002SSKI|5.0|'Now and Then' is a realistic story of life and growing up, and is about four girls (best friends) who made a pact as young girls to always be there whenever each one may need the others. As a child, this was my favorite movie to watch with my mother, which I'll do the same with my daughter when the time comes. It has a feel good kind of vibe to it, and it addresses many real life issues that can occur in a young girl's life. To try and outline the movie itself would not do it justice, so my advice (if you're into 'chick flick's', if you will) is to watch it. I give this movie 5 stars all the way through. The cast and screenplay are wonderful; definitely a movie worth buying as far as women go.
0465011047|5.0|This is an incredible book and an incredible story. There's really not much more I can add to that. If you've ever been fascinated and appalled by the Holocaust, you should read this book as well. There's a Holocaust of its own sort going on in North Korea, and the world should really be more aware of it.    Politics aside, the prose is well-constituted and keeps you reading. The story is fascinating and horrific all at once. Whether you know a lot about North Korea or can't even find it on a map, this book is a worthwhile read.

Disregard the negative reviews. While some of the ingredients are a little harder to find, there is good alternatives to each one. Even with all the little characters, this book is definitely for all ages. Simple recipes :)

1451629184|3.0|Purchasers need to beware. This book is not recommended for all ages. I would say probably 16 or 17 year old and up. Ms. Duggard is very specific, graphic with details/slang words and that's okay .. it's actually necessary for her to heal and go on..as well as letting the general public know about what happened to her BUT certain audiences could go a lifetime without hearing such detail, disgusting detail.    To think the idiot that repeatedly raped her, should have not been on the streets.     Hopefully, her story will prevent more abuse from happening!    I actually cannot finish the book at this time, I am still reeling from what I have read and I am only on page 51!   My heart hurts for Ms. Duggard. This never should have happened to her or anyone else EVER! She is a walking miracle. -_-  >>I am not saying not to read it, I am saying be careful and be aware of who is reading it.<<
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I'm a big Denzel Washington fan,  and this movie is based on an event that happened in Ohio.  This movie is mostly made in western PA so the observer would think that the event took place in PA, and since western PA is so much more beautiful than western Ohio, it was a natural selection for production.  I love to watch Denzel Washington, love trains, love western PA and this is based on real events, so this is a \\"five star\\" movie for me.  And, yes, I have extensively traveled Ohio and have lived and worked in western PA so my observations are factual......................
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|SPOILERS possible    The first ten minutes into this movie and I am hooked. It begins with Dr. Martin Harris who traveled with his wife to Germany in order to attend some kind of a seminar. When the doctor and his wife arrived at the hotel, the doctor found out that he had forgotten a luggage in the airport, so he immediately grabbed a taxi and went back to the airport. But on the way, he got into an accident. The taxi plunged into the river and he hit his head.     The next thing he knew, he was already comatosed for four days and that the seminar is already starting. He remembered tid-bits of what happened, but not everything. He remembered his wife and the hotel though, so he went back to the hotel to search for his wife. To his dismay, when he finally got to his wife, his wife denied him, saying that she didn't know him. And another man, claiming to be Dr. Martin Harris walked over, saying that he was the doctor. And that the doctor himself was an impostor. Having no identification, Dr. Harris has no way of proving that he was himself. And so, questions begin coming up. Who is he? Is he really Dr. Martin Harris? Why did his wife said that she didn't know him? Who is that other man claiming to be Dr. Martin Harris? Why are there suddenly people who wants to take his life?    It all comes together in the end. The acting was really believable. Definitely A+. you can't help but sit there, waiting anxiously to see what will happen to this poor man who has been stripped of everything, wishing the best for him. Watch it. It's a really great movie. don't miss this one!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie is very entertaining and has a great story attached.  \\"RED\\" has lots of action, comedy and  held my attention from start to finish.  Love the actors, they were cast perfectly.
0140277447|3.0|This is the kind of book you don't want to criticize.  It exposes an episode of almost indescribable brutality, that's difficult to read and must have been even more difficult to research and write.  The hell for the residents of Nanking leave the reader shocked and numb after a while.  So much of WWII history, at least in America, is focused on the Nazis and the Holocaust that the horrors of the war in Asia get short shrift, reflecting the undercurrent of racism that pervades US mainstream history.  Iris Chang's contribution is essential, and that it's part of a sadly small body of history makes it all the more necessary.  That Chang committed suicide, apparently to some degree by being so affected by this story, makes it all the more poignant, and all the more difficult to deal with the book's weaknesses.  However they're there, at least three major gaps.  First, she doesn't really document her sources.  Atrocities are notoriously difficult to accurately document; even much of the European Holocaust history involves guesswork.  But it would have helped the book, and help silence the doubters and naysayers, to footnote where possible.  Second, Chang was a good journalist, but a poor historian.  The lack of historical context in her book is striking.  She makes little effort to describe the background behind the Japanese invasion, and is glaringly ignorant of the conflict between the Communists and the Nationalists, who gave the brunt of the fighting against the Japanese to the Red Army and spent more effort dealing with the warlords for power.  And third, she gives a lot of space to the attempts by Westerners, including Nazi agents in China, to protest the brutality, but the irony of having a supposedly positive role played by a Nazi agent close enough to have the ear of the Nazi high command in Germany gets no examination. It's a valuable, earnest, moving book, but the rape of Nanking still sadly awaits a more serious historical treatment.
0547258305|5.0|Easily a 4 1/2 star book so I rounded up. I loved it.<br />Having to wait for a sequel is my only complaint. I want more.<br /><br />For fans of [[ASIN:B004X8W6W0 The Goose Girl (Books of Bayern)]] (a favorite of mine) this book will ring true and kick-it-up-a-notch.<br />Graceling is a term for a person with 'extreme skills' which they call a Grace. Katsa's Grace is killing, so you can be sure there is violence...and she is supremely skilled. I read a few passages to my husband in amazement.<br /><br />I laughed and teared up at parts.

1401223176|5.0|Some readers might be tempted to steer clear of the works of Jeph Loeb because his name has been attached to questionable choices in comics such as The Red Hulk. I ended up very fond of \\"Rulk\\" as many indignantly called the character, but lots of comic fans weren't. Well, if you've read recent Loeb and disapproved or heard him badmouthed by other comic geeks, I hope it doesn't turn you off of Hush. Hush is drawn excellently by Jim Lee and tells a sweeping, complex crime story that will not leave you disappointed. Each of Batman's rogues is used to their fullest, each of Batman's allies is used to their fullest, even Catwoman, a character that most writers make fairly one dimensional is well written and real. Even if you know the true identity of the titular mastermind, it's worth seeing Batman get there and deal with the twists, turns and betrayals along the way. Regardless of your feelings about Jeph Loeb, this is a masterpiece.
0375842209|5.0|Reading The Book Thief was terrific. It was written so uniquely. I have nothing negative to say.

I'm spoiling the ending, not only of the entire book, but of this particular piece of it. I have given you two events in advance, because I don't have much interest in building mystery. Mystery bores me. It chores me. I know what happens and so do you. It's the machinations that wheel us there that aggravate, perplex, interest, and astound me. There are many things to think of. There is much story.<br /><br />It kills me sometimes, how people die.<br /><br />For some reason, dying men always ask questions they know the answer to. Perhaps it's so they can die being right.<br /><br />They say that war is death's best friend, but I must offer you a different point of view on that one. To me, war is like the new boss who expects the impossible. He stands over your shoulder repeating one thing, incessantly: 'Get it done, get it done.' So you work harder. You get the job done. The boss, however does not thank you. He asks for more.<br /><br />Five hundred souls.<br />I carried them in my fingers, like suitcases. Or I'd throw them over my shoulder.

B0036T4GBQ|5.0|I liked this book a lot because one will go from having a victim mentality to an empowering mentality.  I just felt a little too harsh when applying everything in \\"Your Erroneous Zones\\" to my life.  In 90 percent of the instances, yes, this book should be followed.  Just make up your own mind on how to be a strong-minded person with a little bit of civility in tough life situations.  Enjoy the book!
0439023491|5.0|The second book in The Hunger Games series. A fascinating young adult novel set in a parallel/futuristic world. It's a page turner and intense. A thoroughly enjoyable ride.
0439023513|4.0|The third and last book in the Hunger Games trilogy takes an unexpected turn in the stories.  While I think it fits well, I can't say that I'm completely satisfied or pleased personally.  But that's ok because that's not what it's meant to do.  This isn't a love story, or a coming of age story.  It's a war story, and there's noting satisfying or pleasing about war.  We follow Katniss, now in District 13, as she accepts the role of the mockingjay of the rebellion and war rages on with a lot at stake (Peeta!).  But all is not what it seems and morals are subjective.  I was still disappointed in the lack of development in Katniss' character and could never like her after book one as much as I tried, but I have come to terms with what this series is really about.  It's not about Katniss' personal growth and development; it's about war.  Katniss is simply the lens through which we can witness the atrocities and effects of war and human brutality.  Mockingjay is as well paced and suspenseful as the first two books in the series and you'll certainly be staying up late to finish this one to see an end to the Hunger Games trilogy.  Doing a trilogy with an amazing first book is hard to pull off though because there are always tons of expectations. So I still love the second and third books, but definitely not as much as the first one.
0439023521|5.0|**review from 11/2008**<br />A fascinating young adult novel set in the distant future. It was recommended by Stephenie Meyer on her website. I think The Hunger Games will become a very popular book. I couldn't put this one down and read the last 200+ pages into the wee hours of the morning. It wasn't until I got to the very last page and read the words END OF BOOK ONE that I realized I just got hooked on a new series.

I read it in one night, every page I turned was bittersweet because even though it was an awesome story, I didn't want it to end. I hope whoever reads this book finds it as extaordinary as I did. :)
0452270073|4.0|Regeneration - Pat Barker<br />4 stars<br /><br />...... spoilers ahead if you don't know the historical background............<br /><br />This first book in Pat Barker's WW1 war trilogy begins with the poet Siegfried Sassoon's historical war protest,\\"I am making this statement as an act of willful defiance of military authority, because I believe that the War is being deliberately prolonged by those who have the power to end it....\\". His statement is read by another historical figure, Dr. W.H.R. Rivers, the military physician who treats Sassoon and other shell-shocked soldiers at Craiglockhart War Hospital. Rivers is the central character of this intensely psychological story that delves into the moral, ethical and medical dilemmas of treating mentally wounded officers.<br /><br />There is very little action is this story.  It is, appropriately, as meditative and reflective as an analyst's couch. At the time, psychiatry (talk therapy) was in its infancy. There was little political or social acceptance of mental disorders. Rivers is in the unenviable position of needing to \\"cure\\" otherwise healthy men in order to return them to the front. As readers we become aware of the horrors of the war through his patients' dreams and recollections. It's sad, confronting, depressing, and in its own way, fascinating. In addition to creating an intriguing picture of several 20th century literary figures (Sassoon, Owens and Graves), Barker touches many themes that continue to challenge us today. Rivers called it neurasthenia or shell shock. We speak of post traumatic stress disorder. Siegfried Sassoon was diagnosed with battle fatigue as a means of discrediting his opposition to the conduct of the war. He was also a decorated war hero and a closeted homosexual.<br /><br />Barker's writing style is a bit hard to follow. There is very little scene setting or background information.(In the audio version, changes in scene and characters were sometimes difficult to identify.) Information is conveyed through the conversations or thoughts of the characters. Some previous knowledge of the historical characters in definitely helpful. I started this as an audio book which almost caused me to give up on it completely. Peter Firth has a lovely voice, but he was completely monotonal and hardly varied his voice from character to character.  I found myself dosing off as I listened. Fortunately each time I came awake, the text seemed to be presenting something especially thought provoking. I put the audio version aside. When I began again with the written text, I could hardly put it down. I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.rsations or thoughts of the characters.

0439023521|1.0|Before you start down the long path of reading this series, pay close attention to the fact that the last book--[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay]]--has received much weaker reviews than the first two books. That may not seem to matter now, but believe me--it will when you get there. The Hunger Games series is entertaining, but ultimately it leads nowhere. I won't tell you how the story ends, but I will say that any insight, redemption, or spirit that this book may promise will never arrive.<br /><br />It is an empty tale. It's charming but vacant. It settles on the tongue like cotton candy, but never reaches your stomach. It will indeed leave you hungry: hungry for a story with some humanity, some depth. For that, try The Lord of the Rings, or the Chronicles of Narnia, or Harry Potter. The Hunger Games is not even in their league.<br /><br />I regret spending my time on these books. I did enjoy them, most of the time, but in the end I like my stories to be more than cheap thrills and action. I like my action to have a heart beating beneath it. If you do too, keep browsing.
B0000071J0|5.0|As the other reviewers stated, this is a milestone in Italian artsy prog. As I am sure others have done, what attracted me to this lp was the cover art, typical of european prog. After one listen, I have been a devoted fan of Le Orme (The Footprint) since 1975 when I first picked this up in a bargain bin in a nearby mall. I would not too readily compare them to ELP, since they are a bit spacier, but the multi-keyboards do rival that of Emerson, and the vocals resemble an Italian Jon Anderson.<br />It is an interesting concept lp, being a sci-fi story about 2 planets that fight to the death as indicated by the closing finale track 'return to nothing'.<br />I have since bought about 5 or 6 of their lps, most showing musical improvment as the years went on. They can be viewed on youtube playing at what was called Progfest 97. The opening notes of felona and Sorona are identical to the lp at least to the trained ear. Gratzi for this timeless masterpiece!!

We all love the music, so the news is about the remastering job.  well...this release sounds like it was recorded yesterday.  It is clean and grain free.  The drums and bass have greater impact and provide more rhythmic propulsion for the music.  This new life makes listening to \\"cherries\\" even more engaging.  If you liked McCartney before, be prepared to rediscover this great album!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I consciously tempered my expectations for this much-anticipated novel, and I am glad I did. The writing had been on the wall with the relative letdown of A Feast for Crows, like some red comet blazing through the sky of an overly convoluted plot with too many storylines and new POV characters. Unfortunately, A Dance with Dragons follows the same, ponderous tune.<br /><br />As willing as GRRM is to kill off some major POV-characters, he keeps adding new characters and brings back some of those presumed dead. Unfortunately, many of these new characters could not capture me as the original ones could. So the return of Theon was a nice surprise. Of course, Tyrion is truly brilliant, and his chapters were by far the best and showed some satisfying character development. Otherwise, I couldn't connect with many others, as previous favorites Jon Snow and Daenerys managed to annoy me.<br /><br />There is plenty of good as well. The worldbuilding is incredibly intricate and detailed, and extremely well worked out. This series is Epic with a capital E. The same goes for the characters. Like them or not, but they are consistent and life-like, with their good and bad traits and believable motivations. It's too bad that the pacing of a Dance with Dragons is slow, often marred by too-detailed description of food and lacking in action. A pity, even though you can sense the set-up for a phenomenal finish. If GRRM can untangle all these storylines and wrap them up in my lifetime.<br /><br />If I had to liken A Dance with Dragons to one of GRRM's characters, it would be Wyman Manderly, Lord of White Harbor. Huge, slow and ponderous, with plenty of excess fat, but also with some surprising twists of cunning and courage, despite a lack of action.<br /><br />With all my misgivings, GRRM is still one of the best epic fantasy writers out there, and even a novel below his usual standard is still a novel worth reading. I would give three and half stars if I could, but I will give four in the end, just because I know part of my disappointment was due to expectations that could not be tempered.
B000YPWDSS|5.0|Amy Winehouse is gone.  The news is sad for many reasons, but it does drive us back to our CD collection to reevaluate her gifts - and they were extraordinary. This 2 CD album is probably her best known and certainly the number of Grammy Awards would indicate that.  Just the lead song 'Rehab' is worth the price of the recording.<br /><br />Winehouse created a sensation both in the musical world with what was indelibly her own style.  Many of us felt at first like this was another Janis Joplin, not only in her committed delivery but also in her drug abusive life.  It seems like every generation has a wounded sparrow - Edith Piaf, Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin. And like those who came before her she was as much a star off stage as she was on stage.  Now at age 27 she is gone, but with songs such as Rehab,  You Know I'm No Good,  Just Friends, Back To Black,  Love Is A Losing Game and Tears Dry On Their Own her memory will live on.  She was a one of a kind for this generation and it is difficult to say goodbye.  Grady Harp, July 11
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Buying this headset is a *BAD* idea.  The design has no concept of engineering or material science. If you look at a picture, you'll see the cans connect into the headband at a 45deg angle, pivoting on a piece of molded plastic pivot about apx 3/16\\" thick. Even with careful use, there will be stress forces generated on this pin that *WILL* result in it's eventual breakage. Turtle Beach could have spec'd a metal screw between these two parts but chose to save a penny.   The first break happened two months after purchase. After glueing that together (and losing the ability for the one side to pivot) the headphones could be used again. It's now 11 months after original purchase and both sides are broken.

B004BLJQOK|5.0|There has been a major boon in vampire stories of late but most are unwatchable because they ignore major parts of the vampire lore.   Though Let Me In actually does have vampires that do adhere to the basic vampire tenets like, as the title suggests, they have be invited in, Let Me In is not really a vampire movie, they are really just an allegory for the bulling that can go on during school.  Vampires in the movie are neither glorified nor vilified; just like the humans in the film, are just trying to get by.    Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) is the focus of the bullying and has to sit and take it until someone new moves in.  Chloe Grace Moretz (500 Days of Summer) teaches him to stand up for himself, while Smit-McPhee re-teaches her how to be a kid, something she has probably has been for decades if not longer.  It is clear that Moretz and her father figure, Richard Jenkins (The Visitor)  do not kill for sport, or for the fun of it, they do it to survive and there is a guilt behind their eyes when they do that just adds another level to the story.    It is that guilt which is why there is not as much killing in the film, but when there is, it is violent enough to satisfy any horror buff and the bullying scenes are just as terrifying at times.  There is a particular graphic one take car crash that will make you wonder just how they did it (and if so, you will be in luck because there is a special feature on the DVD that goes into detail of how they pulled it off).   It definitely earns its R rating.  Let Me In is worth checking out for anyone who enjoys horror films or just great filmmaking in general.    Aside from the car crash featurette, other bonus features include an audio commentary with the director, a making of featurette as well As one devoted to special effects, and a couple deleted scenes which includes how Moretz's character was turned into a vampire.

It wasn't hard to root for scrawny Steve Rogers. He has a lot of heart. His transformation into Captain America & who he becomes was great to see. He embodies all that is good in American values. The action was great fun & very well done. It has it's lighter moments which I enjoyed & the rest of the audience did too. Of course we were all cheering Captain America on throughout the film. The rest of the cast were superb and spot on. A special nod to Hugo Weaving who played the Red Skull. He does evil so well! I've seen Chris Evans in other films, but this is his best role to date. He brought some real depth to his character.<br /><br />I love Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk. And others to numerous to mention as well. But Captain America just became my favorite super hero.<br /><br />I will definitely be adding this movie to my blu ray collection. Two generous thumbs up.

0439023513|5.0|I know there are tons of reviews already out, and the most helpful 5 stars review really says it all.     This series is about PTSD, about being in the middle of political contraptions you do not control. The thirst for power, getting one regime a little better than the other, but still far from perfect, understanding each other, even against all odds (of being raised in different cultures, different districts with no or very few means of communication). How to deal with the aftermath of the end of a dictatorship, who to choose, unabashed cruelty, and again, again political machinations.     Yes Katniss is powerless or seems powerless. And still she manages to control the small things she can: her relationship with the outside world. It's not powerlessness, it's the ultimate expression of her power.     In Collins' books you find no romantization of battles, of death and of the ultimate sacrifices for the revolution. What's behind images like the Che, is painfully grey. Who has more power, and what you can do with what's left of yours is what matters.     I think the ending is really perfect, she finally lives the life that she wanted, with someone who is more than worthy and they try to move on with the scars this major event in history has left them. Brilliant series.
B004SBX112|1.0|I *hate* ads in my entertainment, and happily pay for ad-free versions where possible. But for this version they charged me for the app, and call it \\"ad-free\\" in the very title, but they still show the ads!!! Now it's not only the birds that are angry. Plus, it crashes a lot, but I'm actually less upset about that than the ads.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The story is compelling and picks up steam about 1/3 through.  However, the prose is simplistic.  At times I felt like I was reading a books for tweens (maybe I was??).  The characters are immensely shallow, and there are quite a few inconsistencies.    Still, I was entertained through the short, light adventure.
0553801473|1.0|Background: loved books 1-3 of the series. Like many, hated feast. Sadly, this book is more similar to Feast than the first three. Almost nothing happens, and the few interesting events are dealt with in severely truncated fashion. Martin spends most of his time having insignificant characters blather about insignificant events. It's a severe disappointment.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />The handful of interesting events:<br /><br />Jamie runs off with Brienne, but we hear nothing about this beyond the fact that he runs off.<br /><br />Rhaegar's son is apparently alive and heads back to Westeros. Once again, nothing happens with it.<br /><br />Dany gets on a dragon and flies off. Something happens, but it's not particularly interesting and does not occur until the end of the book.<br /><br />That brief summary more or less provides all the substance from the book. No need to buy it; just read the wikipedia entry. You'll get just as much out of it, and save a bit of money, and a LOT of time.

Being someone on the Autism spectrum, this movie really highlights the successes as well as the struggles that someone on the Autism spectrum goes through. Most of us Aspies are not as nearly gifted as Grandin seem to be in the film, overall though, the film does an excellent job of portraying what it is like for someone on the spectrum to experience daily.

Once you see how to use this app, all of this stuff is much easier than setting up custom drawers or catalogs on the launchers.  Another amazing benefit that I haven't seen mentioned anywhere else is that my labels are seen and used by Titanium Backup, so everything I do to organize my apps also organizes my backing up and restoring.
B0051OZ564|1.0|I enjoyed \\"300\\" and \\"Watchmen,\\" so I had high hopes for Zach Snyder's latest offering.  But it's just terrible.  The paper-thin plot, the manipulative cartoonish set pieces, the \\"acting.\\"  Nothing redeeming in value about this thing.

B003L20ICE|1.0|Well, yes, the kids are all right - but with little thanks to the so-called adults around them.  I am a huge proponent of same-sex marriage, but that is not what this rather dreary film is about.  It is about three adults who cannot stick to commitments, who are deeply self-indulgent, and who, if they exercised some self-restraint, would be far better parents.  They all show signs of it at times; there is clearly some love and some wisdom buried in these three characters, but it is thrown aside over and over.  I could barely finish the film, and at the end thought, \\"Yes, the kids are all right, but they might have been a good deal more all right if the adults in their lvies acted like adults.
1451629184|5.0|This was way more difficult to read than I thought it would be.  I was prepared, I had thought, to read about what happened during Jaycee's captivity.  But Ms.Duggard truly told all and the details was horrifying.  I felt nauseous and shed more than a few tears as I read the book.  However, I would have done the same if the book were about an adult in these situation.  The fact that it was an 11 year old girl made it ever so much worse.  I wanted to read the book because I had following the story as it unfolded in the media and I wanted to know more about why she didn't escape when it seemed there were times she could have.  I wanted to know why the parole officer's never investigated when they saw him with kids.<br /><br />Duggard answers these questions.  In fact it is easy to understand early on how Phillip mentally conditions her to accept him.  She is left alone with no food, water, anything, tied down.  He becomes her only source of food, drink.  Seeing him walk in means she gets to eat, drink, use the bathroom.  She is mentally conditioned to see him as a (somewhat) positive thing just because the alternative is so very miserable.  I will forever believe that the authorities made mistakes.  On occasion they see Jaycee and never question why she is around the known child molester.  Jaycee is failed time and again by many people in many situations.<br /><br />The positive things that begin to happen after Phillip is arrested bring upon the reunion with Jaycee and her mother.  The good people who come into her life to aid Jaycee helps to encourage the hope that has always been in Jaycee at least to some degree.  She is a true testament to the strength of the human spirit that she can end up in such a positive place and learn and grow with the therapy and support she had.<br /><br />Although I could never read this book over again, I am glad that I read this one.  I wish Jaycee and her daughters all the joy and happiness in the world.

0962477060|1.0|I was pretty enthusiastic about the premise of this book. It seemed exactly the kind of approach I was looking for. Instead of memorizing a bunch of random seeming details, this book promises to cut through to the underlying *logic*. I'm a logical guy so that sounded great.<br /><br />But what is actually presented was, for me, not very logical at all. The whole book seems to focus on the fact that a C chord looks like an A chord (with a capo on fret #3) and then a G (capo on fret #5) and then an E (#8) and then D (#10). Then if you put those letters together, it spells a word in English: CAGED. Great! Now what's \\"logical\\" about that? I'm not saying it's illogical, but after reading the book I never felt like the logic of that was explained. For example, I could say that if you pick a D, move up two frets, back down 4 frets, up 2 over 1 lower, over one higher, and up 2 frets, it spells DECADE. Is that \\"logical\\"? Maybe. But if I don't explain any logic, it's just a bizarre mnemonic.<br /><br />The book seemed inconsistent in places which definitely erodes the \\"logical\\" impression. For example, on page 96 he says, \\"It makes no sense to attempt to play physically difficult chords like F (E form first position) before your hand is ready for it.\\" But way back on page 5 there is a \\"G Form 5th Pos. C Chord\\" that can't possibly be any easier.<br /><br />This left me with the question what exactly should I play or practice using this book? Each page has a bunch of rambling text and on most pages the right half is filled with chord diagrams. Even when the topic is scales or the vaguely defined \\"lead patterns\\", everything is in fretboard chord diagrams.<br /><br />In short, there is no magic way to learn the guitar. If you are really interested in understanding the fretboard (which is a good sign), you'd be better off memorizing CGDAEBF# (My mnemonic is Cute Girls Don't Always Equal Best Friends). Why? Because the logic of the fretboard really comes from the logic of music (to the extent that music is in any way logical). Far more helpful than this book for deciphering the cryptic patterns of a guitar fretboard were two things: first are on-line resources about music theory (the Wikipedia article on \\"Circle Of Fifths\\" is a more logical and universal resource than this book and explains CGDAEBF#). The second thing, which allows you to relate music theory to the guitar, is memorizing the fretboard. I just don't think there is some hokey shortcut to avoid this. If you don't instantly know what note you're playing at all times, you won't be able to properly appreciate the subtle logic of how the guitar is organized.way logical).

B002B554TO|4.0|I've loved this album since I originally bought it on CD back in 2009 and I recently decided to buy Lungs again on Vinyl as a type of collectors item after I saw Florence live at the Hard Rock in Orlando. Vinyl has a different sound and feel to it than mp3 and cd that compliments her sound perfectly .The haze of the vinyl is an appealing twist on her dreamy tracks. I must say, Lungs was a great addition to my vinyl collection. My only complaint is that this is the only vinyl I have bought new that squeels but that may be an individual problem per record and isn't anything the average penny can't improve. If you love Flo and you have a turntable, buy this album!

B000JLPMPS|3.0|Basically I love this film, slow burn plot with strong classic finish. So that's not the point of my review, this is not one of the more vivid looking Blu-rays i've ever seen, i'd argue that an upscaled dvd would look just as good if not better. The colors are muted, bordering on blurry, but not quite. Some scenes look ok, but compared to things like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, yes is typed that.... that movie Blu-ray looks amazingly vivid compared to this and it's an older film. So, i can't see why this looks so average?
1416972250|5.0|Well, what can I say other than I loved The Mortal Instruments series.  At first, I was a little skeptical because I read so many mixed reviews in different places.  I actually got the box set which brings the trilogy as a gift and it was sitting in my bookshelf for almost a year and I finally gave into reading it.<br /><br />Let me first start off by saying that I have read over and over how the Mortal Instruments is a rip-off of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other books.  I, myself, have never read Harry Potter, nor seen none of the HP movies so I wouldn't know.  I've seen Buffy the Vampire slayer movie, but I've never read the books, either.  Regardless, these books completely captivated me from the start.  From the very beginning it's full of action.  The MI series is told in third person, mostly from Clary's perspective, but from time to time it also goes to other character's perspectives which is another thing I loved about the series.<br /><br />The whole plot is amazing.  The twist & turns in this book are absolutely incredible and unpredictable.  This is one of those series that you read and you can't stop thinking about once it's done, and you fall head over heels for Jace.  Ohhh, Jace.  I won't say anymore so I won't spoil it for anyone :)<br /><br />I absolutely recommend the MI series.  Must read!

1451629184|5.0|The book is both very moving and very disturbing.  The loss of family, education, friends, and freedom for eighteen years should not happen to any innocent child.  Yet it did.  It was difficult to read how the pervert Garrido controlled Ms. Dugard for eighteen years.  I am not a psychologist but I think it was to due several factors.  Garrido kept Ms. Dugard in fear of him and additionally made Dugard totally dependent on him for all the necessities and pleasures of life and life itself.  He kept her in fear of the outside world by stories of sexual predators and murderers.  Garrido caused Jaycee to believe she was essentially alone.  Garrido made dependence a habit for Jaycee.  This dependence was made easier by the young age of Jaycee when abducted and by the regression Jaycee suffered after the violent abduction and sexual assaults.  Such regression is common among victims of violent crimes.  Moreover Jaycee had something to lose, her daughters and her pets.  Thus Jaycee found it far easier to submit to her captivity.  Yet Jaycee demonstrated great inner strength and character to endure her long ordeal without  negative effects on her personality.<br /><br />Ms. Dugard writes clearly, effectively, and well.  She is able to cover the eighteen year period and the aftermath without writing an overly long and depressive work.  Yet she is able to enunciate clearly the major occurrences and conditions of her captivity.  Ms. Dugard is a born writer.<br /><br />A big question that the book raises without mentioning it is whether Garrido should have received the death penalty for his monstrous crimes instead of life imprisonment.  To this I have to answer no.  I answer no despite that a large part of me wants to beat the hell out of Phillip Garrido.  Yet I agree with Clarence Darrow that the death penalty for rape and/or kidnapping  only makes the perpetrators of these crimes more likely to murder their victims.  I also tend to believe the death penalty should be reserved for the worst of the worst, or generally for those who commit heinous murders.  With the chance for judicial mistakes the death penalty needs to be limited.  Garrido is a monster and fiend but keep the death penalty for the likes of Joseph Edward Duncan.<br /><br />The book despite its disturbing features is a good read.  Ms. Dugard should continue to write.f the worst, or generally for those who commit heinous murders.  With the chance for judicial mistakes the death penalty needs to be limited.

This movie portrays love at its more powerful place and that is to love someone who cannot love you back anymore, in her case due to altzheimers. It shows the power of love crosses the barriers of time and space when they are young and separated but finds its way back to them and then they have a life together. And love continues to move between them to the point that even death will not separate their love. As the Bible says, love never fails and endures all things...that is what the message of this movie is about.

Readers will be informed, entertained, and enraged. Readers interested in learning more about the \\"Great Panic\\" 0f 2007-2009 will also find \\"In the Fed We Trust,\\" \\"Endgame,\\" and \\"Reckless Endangerment\\" great companions to Lewis' book.
0345522478|1.0|It is rare that I take the time to write a negative review, but it is even rarer that I have to give up a book after six chapters because I simply can't stand any more. The first person narrator is 21 centuries old, a point made over and over again, but though the term \\"old soul\\" was used several times at this point, he is as shallow, banal, self-involved, self-important, and insensitive as a teenager. (That he thinks he is interesting does not make it so--any more than it does for most teenagers.) There is no sense of the maturity and wisdom decades can bring someone--let alone centuries. As for other characters, such as fey gods, they do things like refer, stiltedly (because they too are millennia old but apparently unable to adopt the \\"hip\\" slang and \\"get with the scene\\" the way the narrator can) to \\"new inventions\\" like the Internet and fruit smoothies and wonder if the narrator has heard of them.  I was very quickly disappointed in the characters and what passes for humor, but I was willing to keep reading in case anything about the plot or premises caught my interest. That is an hour of my life I'll never get back again.  After deciding I'd be better off spending the evening with another book, I decided to read the last couple of pages to see how the author wrapped everything up and to see if there was a hint that the book did anything to redeem those earlier chapters.     This will not involve a plot spoiler at all--just an example of the \\"great sense of humor\\" people keep talking about. The narrator has decided to give his faithful sidekick dog, whom he communicates with telepathically, a reward for a job well done. They get home, and the dog discovers that the narrator has arranged for five \\"black, fluffy, curly-tailed French poodles\\" in heat to be waiting for him in the back yard. The dog starts eagerly out there only to suddenly stop, whimper, look sadly at him, and pathetically think/say, \\"Only five?\\"    Seriously. That's the end of the book. That is thewhat is apparently intended as an hysterically funny scene, and it is the last impression the author chose to create for his readers.

B003BWERF8|4.0|This BT adapter works very well as advertised.  I bought it mainly so I could use my iPod Nano 6th Gen (w/touch screen) on a wrist band without having a headphone cord bouncing all over as I run.  It synced very quickly with my headphones.  Since it is powered by the Nano, it causes the Nano power to drain more quickly, but it would easily last 3-4 hours still.  My headphones die before then, so I'm not exactly sure how long.      Also, I tested it by syncing it with my car stereo, which worked also.  In both cases, I didn't even need to enter a PIN to make them sync, which is good, because the Nano doesn't have a way to enter a PIN.  So this product performed exactly as was advertised.    The only reason I didn't give a five star rating is because of the couple of minor Cons I found.  Because the BT adapter plugs into the charging port of the iPod, you can't be charging the iPod at the same time.  While running, no issue.  However, if I were wanting to listen to music on a long road-trip, then being able to use the BT and charge at the same time would be handy.  Also, the instruction manual says that the other devices must have common PINs, like 0000, 1111, 1234, etc.  So if the device you are trying to sync your iPod to has an unusual PIN, then it may not work.    I am very happy with this purchase.
B004H0N4PC|5.0|I found out about Elbow quite by accident while watching a recent episode of Jools Holland during a flight/hotel layover in England.  The first time I heard \\"Lippy Kids\\" I couldn't believe how much it touched me.  If you're an older fart like me, having grown up listening to Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, and other artists of that era, \\"Lippy Kids\\" will spark some memories that you've forgotten for years.  And the anthem \\"Open Arms\\" really propels an optimism and joy that is missing from so much of today's music.    I decided to get the previous two albums of Elbow after listenin to this album.  Both are fantastic.  Each has a collection of songs that will haunt fans of this type of music.  Looking forward to working backwards to the first two albums and can't wait to see what they'll come up with next.    Elbow is a big success in England.  I only hope more Americans will discover this intelligent, imaginative band.

In the future, I will probably just watch the game scenes.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Despite the other negative reviews I found this movie to be the best movie that I have ever seen. Not all people cares about 3D or additional footage. I've seen this movie about 6 times already and I love it. I also have the PS3 and wii games. I can't wait until part 2-3 comes out as long as the story line doesn't get crappy like on most movies when they continue to make sequels. First time I ever saw this movie was in 3D in theaters but to me the 3D could have been made better so I did not care for the 3D part but I still loved the movie.
B0029LHWFO|5.0|Wonderful and facinating autobiography about the foundation and thought process of our current President before he was elected to office. This reads like a like a novel in a lot of ways. It travels a lot through his life and his parents and grandparents lives. The journey to Kenya added to my marveling his open minded view of people and the ways of the world.<br /><br />A lot better than anticipated. I couldn't stop reading. Highly recommend!

0316069353|4.0|I think I may have listened to my last Connelly audio book read by Peter Giles. To me. Mickey Haller has become someone that I don't like or understand well and I think it's due to the tone of the reading. Giles is a skilled reader, but I think he makes Haller seem smug, heartless and and a total \\"gashole\\" (rhyme it) most of the time. Maybe that's the way Connelly wants Haller viewed, I'm not sure. I know if Mickey Haller ran for DA like he proposes he'd might in the book, he wouldn't get this readers vote.<br /><br />As for the story itself, the second half works a whole lot better than the first half as the court drama unfolds. In fact if it wasn't for the splendid courtroom drama I might've ditched my first Connelly book ever (I've read every single one) I was having a lot of trouble caring about the foul-mouthed Haller and his associates and his family life.<br /><br />Get another reader, please.
0770437400|1.0|Honestly, what a snooze fest. (world war zzz...zzz...zzz) At this point there are around 3500 reviews on Amazon for World War Z so I know this review will just get lost in the sea but . . . Anyway, boring from start to finish. The idea is cool. First person accounts from the survivors of the great zombie war after the fact but it just never really took off for me. I know I'm in the minority here but what can I say ? I do enjoy a good zombie read from time to time so one thing I can say about this book is the fact that it never gets gruesome or disgusting. Unfortunatly too many books in the zombie genre are just that and to over the top and well, just plain sick. Too much trash out there for sure. Max Brooks has been able to write a successful zombie book, read by many and enjoyed by most. And he did it without being sadistic and full of filth.

1451629184|3.0|The book was okay.  It's an incredible story but given the circumstances and her lack of education/writing training (I'm not blaming her, just stating the truth), I believe she could have written a stronger more moving story with a ghost writer.  It wasn't badly written given her skill set.<br /><br />I'm really glad that Ms. Dugard survived her kidnapping and nearly two decades of captivity.  It would be interesting to see what she has to say after ten years or so go by.  After more therapy and more time to see what \\"real\\" life is like.  After she has the opportunity to heal more.  I found myself skipping and skimming over parts and not really paying attention.<br /><br />If you've spent years captivated by the story, then you probably want to read the book.  Just don't expect something professional... it is essentially a story told by a child.  This is not meant as an insult.  Just know what you're getting.

B004NSULHM|1.0|Normally I wouldn't even take the time to review an album, but this is just too awful to let slide. I am (or was is perhaps more appropriate) a die-hard Radiohead fan, I have all their albums, EPs, are large number of CD singles, the deluxe editions of In Rainbows and Hail to the Thief, even T-shirts. And I can't think of any other way to put it: this is a woeful album.    The album opens with 'Bloom', an utterly incoherent mess of samples/loops and mumbled, whiny vocals, which pretty much sets the scene for the entire album. I would like to describe the song more accurately, but there is simply no substance to it.    'Morning Mr Magpie' opens with one of the most annoying and poorly mixed guitar riffs I've ever heard, and pretty much continues in the same vein as above - drum loops, mumbled vocals, non-descript lyrics. Listening closely, one can hear some interesting guitar feedback textures around the 2:30 mark, but not nearly interesting enough to redeem such garbage.    'Little by Little' recalls 'Bodysnatchers' from the previous album, but without any focus or energy.    'Feral' is next, except I find it nigh impossible to tell the difference between this track and 'Bloom'. It continues with the same incredibly irritating drum machine and completely incoherent vocalising that is found throughout the album.    'Lotus Flower' - there are almost hints of melody and tune in this one. Unfortunately, the melody (and the bass line) are unremarkable. And don't get me started on the lyrics.    'Codex' is somewhat better, although nowhere remotely as good as a track like 'Sail to the Moon' (Hail to the Thief), the closest comparison I could probably make. It is incredibly repetitive to boot.     'Give up the Ghost' is notable for having an acoustic guitar, although the whole thing sounds like a loop, and it goes nowhere.     As for 'Separator', well, I can't really be bothered anymore. See my comments on 'Bloom' and 'Feral' above. You may as well just listen to 'The Tourist' from OK computer, it is pretty much like they took that track and put it over that god-awful drum loop that they used for almost the entirety of 'King of Limbs' (after removing any hint of melody).    This entire 'album' (if an 8 song demo-quality release can be called that) is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever called themself a Radiohead fan. They could give it away for free and it would still be poor value (unfortunately I eagerly bought the cheaply packaged 'newspaper' version for an exhorbitant amount of money). I can't believe that so many people have given this five stars - although I suspect these are the same people who would give five stars to an album full of Thom Yorke farting into a megaphone.    And a note to those who praise Radiohead for their 'textures' and 'sonic landscapes' (blah blah blah) - drenching every track on the album with reverb does not a 'beautifully atmospheric' album make. Besides, Radiohead are relatively unskilled when it comes to dealing with creating atmospheres (that is, there are people who do it much more successfully) - they only succeeded by placing such effects within the context of well-crafted songs, of which there are none on this album. Some might say the same about Kid A, but at least that album was varied, interesting and had some real energy to it. This is simply the sound of a band that can't be bothered trying anymore.
B004WESFZW|4.0|Based on a short story \\"Adjustment Team\\" by Philip K. Dick and adjusted for the big screen by George Nolfi, this is one fun chase scene after another. If you look further into the story you can find layers of deeper meaning which are thinly veiled from the viewer. However the superficial story of lovers destined to be together and assisted by friends from another reality is quite enough to carry this movie.<br /><br />Looking closely at this film you'll notice that many of the people are not really actors there actually politicians and other famous people. However the filmmakers selected just the right actors to play the characters and the actors do not overwhelm the characters they are playing; so you to imagine yourself as part of the story and find yourself kibitzing.<br /><br />I missed this at the theater but did pick it up on Blu-ray and the particular DVD that I watched had a few interesting extras such as:<br />Deleted and extended scenes<br />The labyrinth of doors: interactive map of New York<br />Leaping through New York<br />Destined to be<br />Becoming a Elide<br />Feature Commentary with/Director George Nolfi<br /><br />Also included extras or things like:<br />My scenes<br />D-box<br /><br />I have to confess that only took advantage of the commentaries.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|2005 movie adaption with Keira Knightley was a master piece introduced me to Jane Austen world.  If Jane is alive today and lived thru our century that time measures in millisecond.  I can imagined she be proud and approved this movie for her contemporary audience.  After watched the movie and then read the book more than 10+ times each. I had to say the movie adaption is truly great in matching the casts and the personalities in the book. It is really picture worth a thousand words.  The cinematic effects, the dialogs and the sets were beautifully created in such brilliant art form; so pleasing to the eyes and so much touching of the heart.<br /><br />Keira carried the whole movie fantastic well; she was alive with the character of Elizabeth Bennett. Her personality, her dark eyes matched Lizzy in the book well. Her expressions and the looks to Darcy were so real to live. Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy was great as in the book; I grew to the character more in re-watch. They had great chemistry. For a modern generation, this movie bridge to the classic. The ages of the actors were very well match to the stories. Not like the BBC TV series or 1940, somehow their age like 30s years old from today looks. Jane's story portrayed Lizzy at 20 years old when the stories began and Lydia at 16. This 2005 movie made a relatable youthfulness of younger people today.<br /><br />After the movie, I can read the book (free download from Amazon Kindle) with a little ease since this was my first classic from high school 30 years ago. The book was detail and added dimensions to that of the movie.  I re-watch the movie and saw the depth of the director and actors painstaking performances on each scene to create the original mood of each setting. The flow of the story is really well as book to movie goes. Many of the scenes were fantastic creations of the word / feeling from the characters in the book. With the music, our human visual & audio senses were flooded with emotions that the book can't. Then I did research on the internet and got the 18th century England Regency period to expand the depth of this story. That again adds depth to the feel of the movie and the book. Especially those forgotten terms like \\"Gentleman\\", \\"Amiable\\", \\"Agreeable\\" that we were brought up in such a faint echo of the early 18t century.<br /><br />Jane Austen thru her book and this movie has re-educated me the hidden Pride & Prejudice in me and how that affected me in many of my life. I surely didn't expect that that much of gains after a light hearted download from Amazon Video to my Tivo.I did research on the internet and got the 18th century England Regency period to expand the depth of this story.

This book actually drove me nuts, i felt like i kept reading the same thing chapter after chapter. I was tired of reading the same things over and over again. At some point towards the later chapters, the writing was confusing and i actually couldn't put it down, only because i wanted to finish reading this and move on to something else.<br /><br />Overall, very disappointed.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I had such high hopes for this book after such a long wait but, unfortunately, this book was middle of the road. I rounded it up to 3 stars, but it rates 2.5; completely middle-of-the-road. There were some really good parts (especially with Theon, Asha and Arya), some bad stuff and some really ugly stuff. This book was better than AFFC (barely) but still disappointing. Lots of fluff, little resolution. GRRM hooked us by killing Ned Stark and letting us know he was playing for keeps, now he's writing in the same style that Brown Ben Plumm plays cyvasse: he does not write to win, he writes so as not to lose. Instead of bold and decisive, we are left with a draw.

Everyday life of a young man (who happens to be a very good race car driver, albeit part time)is narrated by his best friend, his dog. In a little more than a decade, we experience life from the perspective--a perspective that is healthier than most humans by the way--of a canine. The book, besides being very well written, stays right on track (not too verbose) and I promise, you will be happy you read it.

B000VIP5L0|4.0|Sleep, much like Kyuss were a pioneering force in Stoner Rock, who unfortunately broke up before they really got their due, and have since moved on to form the basis of other important bands.<br /><br />Their second album Holy Mountain (also known as Sleep's Holy Mountain) is a touchstone of the genre, the sort of must have album that everyone who likes this type of music either owns or should own.<br /><br />The production value is absolutely minimal, the lyrics are pretty poor sang with no great musicality and the album is absolutely bursting at the seems with Black Sabbath homage.<br /><br />Despite all of this, Sleep's Holy Mountain is a good album, with big riffs and contains the majority of the band's best loved songs. The band's big riffs mixed with loose jam-feel style works wonders on this record. The 1970s influence comes through on everything from songwriting to the tonal choices and what amplifiers they use.<br /><br />For most people, the reputation of the album alone is enough to warrant interest. If you are unsure whether or not the album is for you, listen to the album opener `Dragonaut,' and that should give you a very good indication of the direction of the record.
6304907648|4.0|A slick, stylish, psychological thriller about serial killers, Copycat (1995) isn't very realistic, but it is quite entertaining, providing a nice mix of suspense, action, drama, and mystery.  The story may be somewhat predictable and clich&eacute;d, but the strong performances by Sigorney Weaver, Holly Hunter, and William McNamara, and some surprises and twists, result in a film that is worth seeing.<br /><br />Expert on serial killers Helen Hudson (Weaver) is almost killed by Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jr.), an escaped serial killer that she helped send to prison.  The trauma of almost being hanged in a toilet stall, causes her to become an agoraphobic recluse who never leaves her apartment.  When a serial killer appears to be at work in San Francisco, Hudson contacts the police to offer advice, which leads to her reluctantly becoming involved in the case, working with detectives Mary Jane `MJ' Monahan (Hunter), and Reuben Goetz (Dermont Mulroney).<br /><br />Hudson surmises that the killer is actually copying the modus operandi of various infamous serial killers from the past, such as the Boston Strangler, David Berkowitz, the Hillside Strangler, and Jeffery Dahmer.  Predictably, Hudson becomes a target of the killer, and things start to get very personal.  Her computer is hacked, her home invaded, and those close to her are threatened.  The crisis causes the authorities to make a deal with the devil, as Dr. Hudson videoconferences with Cullum who is behind bars in prison, to get a lead to the copycat killer's identity.  Harry Connick Jr. isn't onscreen much, but he is rather chilling playing a stereotypical psychotic type, who kind of looks like Earnest P. Worrell.<br /><br />Copycat is guilty of being overdramatic, and the agoraphobic attacks are one element that are a bit hard to take, as Helen Hudson kind of fluctuates between being capable and proactive, to being vulnerable and too scared to move.  Sigorney Weaver pulls it off well, bringing an edge and believability to her performance, even though the situations are sometimes ridiculous.  William McNamara gives a gripping performance as Peter Foley, a cold hearted killer who has a chameleon-like ability to adapt his appearance and personality, to accomplish his grisly deeds.  At the finish, Foley steps nicely into the spotlight, displaying signs of madness, without going too far overboard.<br /><br />At 123 minutes, the movie runs a little long, and might have benefited from trimming some the periphery drama, like Monahan's romantic relationship with another cop (Will Patton).  While the storyline humanizes the character, and gives Holly Hunter a chance to dig deeper, it really doesn't add significantly to the central story.<br /><br />The DVD release features both widescreen and full screen presentations, and a very insightful and on topic audio commentary by director Jon Amiel, who among many things, reveals that the original screenplay was reworked to feature two women in the leading roles.  Obviously a fortuitous decision, as Hunter and Weaver have some great scenes together.

B000001EUP|4.0|I remember when this was released.  My cousin had just bought his first car and we spent the entire weekend driving around with this blasting through the new technology - in dash cassette deck.  By the end of the weekend I was so sick of it that it took me another 25 years to listen to it again.  It IS a very good album and more of the songs are good than bad.  I would say this was their peak.  I also thought it was interesting that Don Dokken was hired to sing back up vocals.  This was a year or two before Dokken really broke.
0553801473|5.0|I never understand the fans that expect too much from an author and it seems many of Martin's readers are just this breed. This book despite it's many 1-4 star reviews is still without a doubt worth all five. If you found this book slow or laboring I'm sorry but perhaps you should take up a new hobby other then reading. In every one of Martin's books I found myself skimming some of the less interesting character chapters in this one I skimmed only one complete one and half of another one that picked up enough to force me to read it. Considering I skimmed about five per book (7 in AFFC)I really am perplexed by the other readers reaction to this engaging and wonderfully written book. The people complaining of cliff hanger obviously haven't read the rest of the series to completely as this is what he does every time normally with at least 4 characters yet the only real cliff hanger in this one involves the possible death of one of the mains. The rest was resolved perfectly to set up the rest for the next two books. This one literally had me cheering out loud multiple times (much to my wife's dismay as many of these were in the middle of the night). The book resolves just enough with every character again with one exception to keep you ready and anxious for the next two books which if you expected things to come to a head before then you were only fooling yourself. Considering how many characters are represented I'm surprised the book is even nearly as short as it is (almost a thousand pages and it still seemed too short. Needless to say I found the Book equally engaging as the second and third books, superior by far to the fourth, and inferior only to the original which isn't a reflection at all considering it is one of the greatest novels ever written in this reviewers humble opinion. In short the book is almost perfect with only a few faults it maintains well the writing  and character of all it's predecessors and anyone who says otherwise is simply delusional or spoiled by our \\"give it to me now\\" world culture, and I for one am excited for whatever Mr. Martin serves us next. If there is any doubt to the delusions of the individual giving this 1 star just try to compare it to other highly praised novels (Hunger Games, Twilight).

B003YBNREI|3.0|At first all the reviews seem glowing for the latest effort so I listened.  I'm no stranger to the Doobie Brothers, especially the Tom Johnston era, which I consider the best period for the Doobie Brothers' sound. For the most part, this release harkens back to that sound. However, it lacks the rawness of rockers such as \\"Disciple\\" or \\"China Grove\\" or \\"Without You\\".   Granted they are much older than they were when they recorded those classics but given that, there could have been more electric guitar on this release and still kept the same feel. As it stands, here is a release containing eleven songs that remind the listener of \\"South City  Midnight Lady\\" or \\"Black Water\\". One of the reasons I loved that sound was due to unique songs blended with a hard edge rock guitar.   It is still a good release.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These cans combine clear, detailed sound, phenomenal durability and a great price. That's why broadcasters like me use them (several people I work with are MDR-7506 owners), as do engineers in recording studios and film and TV soundpeople. These 'phones are almost identical to the MDR-V6, but there are differences that go beyond the cosmetic. The 7506's internal wiring is a bit different, using a separate ground for the left and right channels, rather than the single ground for both channels used in the V6. I like the sound of both 'phones, so I bought both. To my ears, this difference in the wiring gives the 7506's better stereo separation and a more open sound, but the V6's sound a bit \\"warmer\\". All in all, great headphones--I just wish they were somewhat looser on my size 7 and three-quarters head!! They do seem to be loosening up a bit. Maybe they just need more time. Love the solid construction. I got the V6's first, on the recommendation of a former co-worker who told me he's still doing his daily airshift with the same cans, after 20 YEARS. A current co-worker let me try his 7506's, and I said, \\"Gotta have these, too\\". I highly recommend both.
0060989157|5.0|I bought this strictly as a mindless distraction and that is exactly what it is.  I found the first 1/2 of the book especially interesting as I grew up listening to the Crue and always idolized them.  I jumped ship after \\"Theater of Pain\\" was released because it was so awful (which the band agrees with) so this filled in some spaces of that era.  The more recent events aren't all that interesting as the internet has beaten them into the ground.<br /><br />I will say that I have lost all respect for them as human beings.  They went far and beyond the rock star life style and truely were scumbags.  Even as a 13 year old, if I had know how they behaved, I would never have idolized them.  Doesn't change my opinion of the music, but as people, I wouldn't have spent so much time thinking they were cool.<br /><br />I wish Mick would have written more as he had a very small part of the book, most likely due to his withdrawn nature.  This actually makes him much more interesting than the others as they are severe extroverts.<br /><br />Great book for killing time as it is an easy and quick read and a trip down memory lane.

At times it is fine and at times it is awful. Who was in charge of script? Why did the 'lighting' go bad during night shots? And why are there so many endless monologues? This could be a great tv show but I am disappointed. However, there are some high moments too. All in all, 3 stars out of 5 would suffice. I wish I could give it 4 stars.
0375842381|2.0|I wish I had better, more wonderful things to say about these books, but unfortunately I do not.      I will start by saying that reading through the first two books was a treat, and I thoroughly enjoyed them, anxiously awaiting the ending to the story.  However, reading the third and final book killed my enthusiasm for all three novels entirely.  Without giving away the ending, it seems to me as if the author crafted these books merely to push a personal agenda, which may or may not jive with that of the individual reading the books.  His story would have resonated better had he left some level of mystery around his ending, allowing the reader to come to his or her own conclusions, rather than explicitly telling us what to take away from the story.  And therein lies the series' ultimate failing.    I will conclude by saying that this trilogy is not for everyone.  Some may like it's ideas, others may hate them.  I would suggest though that any parent should read through the entire series before passing it on to their children.  It certainly wouldn't be something I'd introduce to my young children, though adults should make up their own opinion about it.
B004LP601S|5.0|If you loved Panic!s first album and could only scratch your head at their sophomore-then you will be happy to hear that this album takes it back to what they were good at in the beginning. All I can say is the second album's title \\"Pretty.Odd.\\" explained their musical choices for that album all too well. I was worried they were drifting in to hipster folk territory and that's NOT what I wanted to hear from them. The reason I liked them from the beginning is because they were so different and original. They were the first to really have that danceable, fun yet creepy Tim Burton-esque vibe to their music.

We know all about the suburbs and have for years. Ditto the suburbs in the Midwest. But Franzen is convinced he's got it all figured out, the whole corrupt adult world. And really that's the key to this novel. It's just another installment of fetishism for lost childhood innocence and the rotten adults aka parents who steal and stomp that innocence in so many ways. In short, this is one long whine. Alas, it's the kind of wine you can't drink. And drink you must if you want to make to the end of Franzen's last will and testament to America, the Ugly American.      If he's smart, he'll cut out the diary completely, cut the rest in half and then release it as a short novel. Might work.

B004S5D3B6|3.0|I read the build up to this film's release. I must say I'm disappointed in the final product. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor. Whether he thought he could carry the whole project on his persona? Or, the project was hamstrung by limited finances. The film never drew me in, & made me believe the characters. Bayle's interpretation of a crack addict needs work, IMHO. Wahlberg never seems to put his heart into this role 100%. The cinematography looks budget minded. Some of the scenes look like they were laid out in w/only a few minute's thought. They may have been trying for an up close, more street level feel to the movie. They didn't make it. Lastly, the fight scenes @the end had some very unrealistic choreography in them.    It's too bad. The true story behind the pic is strong. They had some good actors in it. It never became more than the sum of its parts. I don't think it really even measured up to the sum of its parts... Hey, they're only human. I imagine it's a fine line between hitting a home run, or a dud. Some of the dynamics between his girlfriend & his family were the most believable parts of the film. Ah Well... Sorry Marky Mark. You didn't do it this time. Learn from some of Afleck's mistakes. Don't keep going back to Southy for roles. You won't be challenged to step it up. Your fans won't buy the weak performance.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|Wow some reviewed this and call it stupid or that it is a pedantic and not &quot;scientific&quot; in its approach to the creation of elements. Guys remember it is called &quot;Alchemy&quot;. Not scientific method . I have found it truly engaging and a bit of a puzzle. Several of my friends and I are trying to race one another to the finish. For a free game this one is almost perfect. It sometimes will throw the elements off screen when they get added to the work screen, but I can live with a slight glitch.
1594744769|2.0|I could almost point to the page where this novel turns from being a wonderfully eerie ghost story to being a messy, overplotted would-be Harry Potter adventure that manages to both overexplain and underexplain everything.     And, of course, I was very disappointed as I was running out of pages and thinking \\"How can this possibly be resolved?\\" to find that this is not a stand-alone novel but the first in a series. I do feel a bit cheated by that. More than a bit.    Also: Given the money that obviously went into the production of the book (the fine paper, the color),  I thought that the layout (particularly the juxtaposition of text and photos) was dismayingly sloppy.    And am I the only reader to note the moment at which the hero has his hands tied behind his back and then, moment later, removes his shoes? Nice trick, that.    Well, I went into this with great expectations. Perhaps too great. So perhaps my disappointment is also outsized.

This is an amazing, riveting, suspensful novel that I couldn't put down! Very well written and, as others have commented, the author creates a \\"you are there\\" atmosphere. The down-side of having read this is that it has me more concerned than ever about the future of our society and our selfish, frivilous values. Serious soul-searching is due and this book is the vehicle.  Congratulations, Ms. Collins!

0316067938|2.0|Some parts of the Twilight Saga were a little cheesy, a little overplayed, a little typical. I hate to say it, but this is a TON rather than a little. Parts of this are so ridiculous that it just seems to be a way to end the series rather than a possible good book.<br /><br />First, I'd like to say that, unlike all of the other books so far, this one is broken up into three sections. The first and third are in Bella's point of view, and the second is funnily enough in Jacob's. The names of the chapters in Jacob's section are enough to bump this review from one star to two. Example: \\"You know things are bad when you feel guilty for being rude to vampires.\\" You really like and appreciate Jacob and enjoy the funnier parts that come with his point-of-view, even if you are a die-hard Edward fan (like me).<br /><br />So Bella and Edward got married. In a real ceremony. With people there. Not going to Vegas to elope and have a drive-through ceremony, as the two joke (or not, since Bella didn't want to get married and Edward did). They have their honeymoon. Bella manages to get pregnant. End of book one. Jacob is angry at everything in his life, basically. Problems with his packmates and Bella's marriage and then pregnancy are a bit much to handle. And so on. Jacob creates his own pack. Add in another meeting with the Volturi and a bunch of other vampires to finish off the story.<br /><br />There were a lot of very strange parts of the story, more than in the other books. Everything definitely feels like creative license was used to overstep too many boundaries. Just a quick little fact - Bella's pregnancy of her half-vampire child is actually shorter than a typical fully-human pregnancy of nine months. I'd say it's more of two or three months. And since it's half-vampire, and since vampires don't age, you'd think that the pregnancy would go on for longer, if anything. You've got a way to keep Jacob in the picture and still best friends with Bella, even after the marriage and everything. With the pregnancy, all of a sudden Rosalie is caring and nurturing and acts like Bella's loving sister or nurse or whatever. It's all like that.<br /><br />On the other hand, though, Stephanie Meyer has created a story where it takes a ton of creative license to allow for a good ending. Bella wants her best friend and her boyfriend (now husband). Of course, it would have been a lot better if Bella didn't get her way totally, because that almost never happens in books. She made her decision between Edward and Jacob. Now she must follow the consequences like everybody else. Unfortunately, for a woman who is too unwilling to kill off anyone with a sense of decency (ten werewolves, seven good vampires, Bella, and all of her human friends and family survived Eclipse while none of the bad guys did), she can't even make an ending book all that good. Making some regrettable decisions earlier in the story would have obviously made a more realistic and less strange ending entirely possible.pregnancy, all of a sudden Rosalie is caring and nurturing and acts like Bella's loving sister or nurse or whatever.

0060930349|2.0|I decided to read this book to refresh my memory of American History before teaching it again this fall.  I have read numerous books on the subject so I was looking for something that was interesting, yet informative.  At first, it seemed to fulfill my goals.  However, early on I began to get a bad vibe because I noticed small mistakes cropping up that prompted me to sense that some of Johnson's research had been lazy.  He also used terms that stuck out like referring to the Confederacy as the \\"Confederation\\" or the Union army as the \\"Unionist\\" army.  What American historian would make a mistake like that?  When I checked the back cover I discovered that Johnson is apparently British which might explain some of these faulty terms.         I decided to press on because the book is interesting and I do not mind historians giving opinions.  (Although I will always wonder if his conservative bent would have gotten intolerable as the book moved into the post-WWII period.)  I have read enough American History to recognize opinions when I read them.  It concerns me that many of the readers might not distinguish his opinions from facts.  I also did not mind his emphasis of the role of religion on American History.  You don't get that much in books like this so it was a welcome addition.  However, it does strike me as a theme that was included because it is a particular interest of Johnson, not so much because it was important to add to historical understanding.        My big problem, and the reason I had to stop reading the book (something I very seldom do) was the ridiculous historical errors which finally wore me down and made me wonder how many mistakes I was not catching.  I stopped in the middle of the Civil War because his coverage was filled with errors. Don't get me wrong, I do not expect an historian to be an expert on everything in American History.  However, Johnson's mistakes were laughable.  For example, he describes the First Battle of Bull Run as a Confederate offensive against Washington.  He then confuses Joseph Johnston with Albert Sidney Jonhston.  He obviously thinks that Stonewall Jackson was in command of the Army of Northern Virginia until \\"shot in the back\\" by Rebel soldiers.  His coverage of the Battle of Gettysburg has several howlers. At this point I could not take it any more.  To make matters worse, either Johnson is not good at spelling and grammar or the book had a terrible editor.  Either way, there are some embarassing mistakes in this area as well.        I am upset that most of the reviews are very positive which is scary because either these people did not realize they were exposed to numerous errors or they don't care just so long as the book is interesting.
0439813786|4.0|I foung this book as one i have wanted to read for a long time but didnt really know much about it . It is a very interesting story but most of it is told in beautiful black and grey drawings . I love the pictures from the old silent movies which brought me back to when you could rent a projector and old reel to reel movies my mother did that on a weekly basis when i was a kid and i got to enjoy old black and white movies and silent films including harold lloyd and charlie chaplin  so those were so fun to see. The only downfall of this book was that there was not much reading in it I think there could have been a few less pictures and a little bit more writing then i could have got more into the characters but that did not diminsh my like of this book too much. It is a great idea and a great book for a non-reader to pull them into reading . I would say most people will not be disappointed it tells a great story just be aware that it is mostly pictures and you will more then likely finish it quickly as i did
1439153663|5.0|This book had my undivided attention from beginning to end. I felt like I knew the characters personally and was a part of their world. I cried with them and laughed with them. It has been a while since I have felt such emotional attachment to a book. I do not know why the people who rated it one star say that it is poorly written? I highly recommend this book and cannot wait to buy it for Christmas presents!
0316017930|5.0|I received this book as a graduation present from one of my favorite teachers, and I am so glad that I got it. It is a wonderful insight on the methods successful people have used to get where they are today. And, above all, I really do agree with the author's message that for anything we really want to accomplish or truly be passionate about, we need to dedicate time to it, in this case, 10,000 hours. Regardless, I loved the book, and I think I may just read it again. :)
B0015R9K2G|5.0|I enjoyed this book, as it wasnt incredibly confusing as some history books are, or dragging like most.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book was a very honest and vulnerable expression of everything Jaycee went through. The first chapter or so is a little difficult to get through due to her writing style, but then she jumps right into things. I would recommend reading this. As a survivor, she is very easy to relate to thanks to her openness and honesty. But it is also an essential for others that have loved ones who were traumatized to get a better understanding of their experience.
0062060554|4.0|This book was quite a surprise. The concept was unique and tantalizing. Imagine going to sleep at night and waking in the morning without any memory of who you are or who it is sleeping next to you! I complement the author's ability to keep the complexity of the theme without slipping up with inconsistancies. There is one or two, but they are insignificant and do not otherwise detract from the story. The mystery part is well done. The twist at the end is superb and adds to the readers thoughts of something really terrifying. Its hard to describe this book further without giving away details of the plot. So I'm not going to. Take a chance and read it - it's good.
B003Y5H59W|5.0|It's crucial that you get to like Steve Rogers when he was only this 98-pound weakling, crucial that you grow to care for this runty, scrawny, asthmatic kid who persists in standing up for himself and for others, never mind that this usually rewards him with bruises and lumps. It's 1943, in wartime America, and Steve Rogers yearns to do his part, if the military would only allow him to. Five times he's tried to enlist only to be summarily rejected as 4F. Meanwhile, his best friend James \\"Bucky\\" Barnes is a sergeant in the U.S. Army, cutting a dashing figure, shining the ladies, bullying those who'd been bullying Steve. You note Steve's lack of resentment over this, and like him for it.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is the one I'd been looking forward to the most this year, and I'm pleased as punch to say that this movie did not tank, that it in fact is fairly bloody brilliant. I enjoyed THOR and X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, but CAPTAIN AMERICA is the best Marvel flick since IRON MAN and it gets you charged up for THE AVENGERS movie. Chris Evans - damn.<br /><br />Steve Rogers's impassioned speech to Bucky is overheard by Dr. Abraham Erskine, a kindly German scientist working for the U.S. government. Dr. Erskine heads a top secret government program involving the creation of the super-soldier, and on these shores he's looking for a candidate to be his inaugural test subject (he'd had an earlier candidate elsewhere but that didn't work out so well; more on that in a bit). Dr. Erskine sees past Steve's sickly frame. He's intrigued with Steve's spirit. He gets him enlisted in the U.S. Army.<br /><br />Compared to the rest of the film, the first third segment is less action-packed, but that doesn't equate to dull or slow. We track Steve Rogers' time in boot camp and we take in his struggles. He tires easy. He's always finishing last. The camp's gruff director, Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones, hogging all the good lines), is highly skeptical and takes Dr. Erskine to task for Rogers' presence. But we note Rogers' quiet diligence and doggedness, and these strong character moments provide the building blocks for making what happens to him later so resonating and gratifying.<br /><br />If you're caught up on Marvel Comics continuity, then you're up to snuff on what happens next. Steve Rogers undergoes Erskine's treatment which galvanizes change on an awesome cellular scale. I think the best CG work done by the film's f/x crew, hands down, is in the shrinking and scrawnying of Chris Evans and making it look seamless. Steve Rogers as the beneficiary of the super-soldier serum is a picture in bold contrast, a foot taller and now rippling with muscles. But this is Chris Evans in real, the guy having worked his tail off to get this buff (even though Chris Hemsworth probably still points at him and smirks).<br /><br />If you don't know your Captain America history, I'll just mention that an act of sabotage renders Steve Rogers the world's one and only super soldier. Which gets us to an inspired plot thread which isn't part of Captain America lore. And, fine, here's a ***SPOILERS alert*** for the rest of this paragraph. With Rogers the only one of his kind, Colonel Phillips has no use for him, and so Steve Rogers is deployed to USO tour appearances, putting on a show in the home front with chorus girls and shilling war bonds as the military mascot \\"Captain America.\\" Like a good soldier, Steve goes along with it, but he wishes he could do more. We know that Cap will join the war soon enough, but, in the meantime, his time on stage just fills me with cinematic joy. I absolutely love that he gets his own awesome show jingle, \\"Star Spangled Man,\\" with music by Alan Menken. I also like how the film addresses the inherent cheesiness of the traditional Captain America costume, which is what he wears on these shows. Cap's later costume re-design would be more practical, less shiny, less tights.<br /><br />Chris Evans inhabits his role with conviction, imbues Steve Rogers with spunk and an appealing sweetness, and I'm not worried any more about how he might hold up against Robert Downey, Jr. and Samuel Jackson in THE AVENGERS movie. He just proved to me that he can command the screen. Fine actors like Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hugo Weaving add so much to the story. If you could point at the heart of the story, it may be the almost father-son relationship between Steve Rogers and Tucci's Dr. Erskine. Tucci isn't in the film much, but he leaves a defining mark. I was concerned about how the Red Skull would come off, but I should've known Hugo Weaving would make it work. His Nazi commandant, Johann Schmidt a.k.a. the Red Skull, is a convincing villain and, incidentally, a failed past test subject of Erskine's. As a guilty pleasure, I'm glad the biochemist Arnim Zola is here as well. Or, I dunno, maybe I'm fond of him because Ookla the Mok's \\"Super Skrull\\" song references him. (\\"He's endorsing RC Cola and cruising chicks with Arnim Zola.\\")<br /><br />Parts of Steve's origin are snatched from Marvel's Ultimate universe (portraying Bucky as someone in Steve's age bracket, for one thing). For fans of Marvel's cinematic continuity, Dominic Cooper riffs Robert Downey, Jr. a bit as Tony Stark's rakish genius industrialist father, Howard Stark. I wish Hayley Atwell as British Agent Peggy Carter were given more to do, but I suspect Atwell will reappear in future films as Agent 13, Sharon Carter. And if you were expecting Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos to show up, you're sort of right. The action is terrific, and maybe it's terrific because the story had taken the time to invest in its lead character. These aren't just tatters of action sequences. There's a compelling thru arc to tie everything together.<br /><br />But, okay, one thing nagged me. There's something jarringly anachronistic about the presence of Hydra and its super science. The strongest emotional impression I have to Cap is that he was a World War II hero who fought the Nazis and later became a tormented man-out-of-time. This movie removes the first part by replacing the Nazis with Hydra goons. And, although Hydra is supposed to be affiliated with them storm troopers - serving as Hitler's \\"deep science division\\" - it's not the same. \\"Heil Hydra!\\" just doesn't ring true. And Nazis always did make the best big bads.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER gives it up with that old-fashioned wartime nostalgia, with a grip of strong performances, with an indomitable legend to whom Chris Evans does justice. This movie has heart. Nothing embodies that more than the sequence in which the new Steve Rogers is in pursuit of a spy who tries to distract him by tossing a boy into the drink. About to dive in the water, Steve hears the boy briskly yell at him: \\"I can swim. Go get him!\\" That bit of bravado from the kid generated the loudest cheers from the theater audience.<br /><br />As per norm, stick around until after the closing credits.

0553801473|3.0|Okay if you've gotten this far in the series you probably wouldn't be stopped reading this book by a review. I'll just tell you what you're going into. I feel like it was just an okay book. The reason being : imagine you split a book in two, one of those parts you double the number of pages but cut in half the progress of the characters and you get A Dance with Dragons. There are some twists to go around, and George R.R. Martin writes really well, but he also writes too much about unnecessary things such as food.. lots of food. I don't care how the goddamm pig was cooked. It makes the pace seem really slow as you wait for something to happen. The amount of pages it took for a character to go from one place to the next is staggeringly slower than past novels. In the end there are little confrontations that you would've liked to happen.

Husbands and wives, children and parents, lovers in love and men and their work. Spanning fifty years these characters show you their hearts,empty or full of love and hate. Not only are the characters intresting but the author has seamlesly woven their stories in such a believable fashion you may find yourself sorry that the book is coming to a conclusion. Enjoy.
0061205699|5.0|I first read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in my sophomore year of high school and I was completely floored and in so much awe at the height of emotions that this book commands. Fast forward ten years later and it is still my favorite. The story told thru the eyes of the vivacious tomboy Scout Finch is one wrought with so much truth and I simply cannot describe how much I truly truly adore this book. Scout's innocence is absolutely necessary and that is what makes the story. I highly recommend this one.

B005D9MUWY|1.0|There's nothing more annoying than an app that makes &quot;corrections&quot; to your messages / writing that don't make sense at all.
0553801473|5.0|First of all, let me say that I totally understand where the people giving 2 or 3 star ratings are coming from.  I agree with the criticisms.  This book takes the plot threads from the previous several books, adds a number of new ones, and resolves only one or two at most.  Just when all the threads are coming together and everything is setup for a climactic conclusion, the book just ends.  It's infuriating.  If you hate cliffhangers, I'd suggest not even reading this book (or the previous one, for that matter) until the series is finished.  Just forget it and come back in ~10 years.<br /><br />All that said, it was still compelling and entertaining as ever.  I also found it a considerable improvement over AFFC, but that may just be because I was more interested in the characters featured in this book.  As much as I was frustrated by the ending, I can't wait for the next one.
0061743526|5.0|Like many people, I first read this book in high school. I have since taught it three times to classes. This summer, I am rereading it as I tutor a student from India who will read TKAM this fall in her high school English class. What an amazing book! Seeing it through the eyes of someone for whom the idioms and cultural references are new is great. I wish it would become available for Kindle so that she could immediately look up some of the great vocabulary that Harper Lee used. While that \\"great vocabulary\\" doesn't necessarily include the \\"n word,\\" that word is necessary to embody the racism and attitudes of the times -- also an interesting concept to try to explain to a foreign student. Everyone should read To Kill a Mockingbird more than once in his or her lifetime and live its lessons. Don't judge a person until you've walked a mile in his skin.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It only took me a few hours to read this book.  I did not want to put it down.  Suzanne Collins does an amazing job of getting the characters into focus and keeping them real, and did a superb job of describing everything to the point where I could picture it all- the Capitol, the arena, and the various Districts.  I can't wait to read the other books in the series.  I'm looking forward to my kids reading this one.
B000002UAO|5.0|I have, or at one time had the complete Beatles, but an auto burglery took care of the ones I had on CD. I haven't replaced all I lost, but I HAD to buy this one again. Everyone has their favorites, and as the Heavy Metalist that made the video with Pamela Anderson said, 'It's all Good.\\" But \\"Rubber Soul\\" is the very best. One man's opinion, but what do I know? I traded two tickets to the Beatles concerts in Memphis in 1966 for a watch my little sister had won on the same radio contestwhere I won the tickets. The watch did keep good time; I could do a perfect countdown to the class bell for three years at WHS.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Seven hot songs out of fourteen entries: I'll take it.  My favorite being 'times like these'.      Their songs move, like Greenday (long ago).  Well written musically and well performed.
0312323867|5.0|This book picks up where Something Borrowed left off, only it's from Darcy's point of view. I wasn't too excited about it because I had come to hate Darcy in the first book. But I actually started to feel sorry for her this time because she was so shallow, selfish, clueless, and unhappy.<br /><br />In this book, everything she has done in the past is coming back to haunt her. Of course, she still wants to blame all of her misfortune on others until her friend, Ethan, rips into her and tells her like it is. It turns into a huge wake-up call for Darcy.<br /><br />Intent on changing herself, she finds it hard to not revert back to her selfish and shallow ways and thoughts. But she charges on, determined to start a new life in a new country while pregnant. Of course, it's not going as smoothly as she thought it would. And, all along, she is falling for the one person she never considered worthy mate.<br /><br />This was just a little better than the first book and some of the things Darcy does and says are just so comical I had to  rate it higher because it made me laugh out loud because she is so clueless. I really wish there was a third book because I would love to know what happens even farther down the line!
6305076995|5.0|Yes at their best.  If you are interested in really understanding the breadth of what true pro-rock is, this is the dvd for you.  The sound and video quality is not great, but adequate enough to show off how amazing this band was.
0316056863|5.0|I absolutely love Tina Fey! I loved her on SNL and 30 Rock is one of my favorite shows. So when I heard she had a book out, I HAD to read it. And it does not disappoint.<br /><br />If you are at all familiar with Tina Fey, you understand her style of humor. And her book is written in the same way. The book covers some of her growing up, her early start in improv and stand-up, boyfriends, and her gay friends. She is even hysterical when writing about how she had her face slashed by a stranger in an alley when she was a small child. Only Tina Fey could make that situation humorous.<br /><br />I wouldn't even know where to begin to describe all of the funny subjects she writes about since it's really a little of everything. She writes about her years on SNL, starting her own show, motherhood, family, her first job, her harrowing honeymoon, and her weight. Nothing is off limits to her. About gay prejudice and phobia she writes, \\"Gay people don't actually try to convert people. That's Jehovah's Witnesses you're thinking of.\\" I swear every other sentence in the book had me laughing.<br /><br />This book is a must if you are a fan of Tina Fey or comedy in general. I've read books by other comedians and they honestly did not come close to producing the laughter that Bossypants did!
0788859544|5.0|One of the best Disney Cartoons ever! When my sons were toddlers we watched this movie almost daily for over two years and my wife and I still watch it on occasion! The seller promised to send the DVD within three weeks and I received it in five days and in brand new condition!
B003XRDYX2|5.0|Columbia has truly gone the extra mile with this one. \\"The Original Mono Recordings\\" is a truly monumental release, as it is the first time that Dylan's first eight albums are available in, as the title states, their original mono pressings. The sound on these records is simply glorious. Anyone who owns the SACD stereo remasters of these records from 2004 can now discard of them; while they were certainly the best those recordings sounded up to that point, the mono recordings are more natural sounding, as well as having more punch and warmth to them.<br /><br />The acoustic records benefit the most. Releasing them in stereo was a bad idea to begin with, making for a very awkward listening experience. The mono recordings make you feel like Bob is in the room with you. They now have the same warmth and intimacy on cd that they did on record 50 years ago. The electric records aren't as noticeable an improvement, but certain songs do jump out at you. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was meant to be heard in mono, with every sound coming right at you and kicking you in the ass, rather than taking its time to come together on the stereo records. \\"Visions of Johanna\\" has a similar effect, captivating you right from the opening strains. A select few do indeed sound better in stereo form (\\"Most Likely...\\" sounds surprisingly weakened) but the difference for the most part is quite negligible, and the fact these are, in fact, the way Dylan and co. meant for them to be heard makes it a pretty easy choice for most fans.<br /><br />The packaging is superb. The slip cases are beautiful recreations of the original pressings, and the accompanying booklet is brimming with a fine essay and rare photographs. As stated, Columbia did not slack in making this a special effort. \\"The Original Mono Recordings\\" is a wholly worthwhile purchase, and essential for Dylan scholars.
B00005QC4O|5.0|Over the years I've listened to the original album a few thousand times, give or take a few. If I were stuck on a desert island and could only take 10 albums, American Beauty would be one of those 10. So the first time I heard this version (in surround sound) it was like hearing it for the first time! It has been remastered and uncut. Each song appears to be 10-20 seconds longer than the original Warner Brothers release (which really makes a difference, especially on the fade-out riff at the end of Candyman) and I promise you, when you listen to this audioDVD, you will hear notes and sounds that you never heard before. It is fantastic! For the purist Deadhead this is a must!
B004W48QFG|5.0|this is a must have app if you have the asus transformer. Trackpad, rightclick, ctrl+ all work flawlessly. Thanks for such a great product
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I really liked Wuthering Heights.  Heathcliff is a \\"little\\" disturbing.  When I first started reading it, I was like what?  But, once I got to chapter 2 or 3 things started making more sense and I couldn't hardly put it down.  Once I finished the book, I went back and read the beginning and it makes sense because you know the whole story.  Very good, if you like the older, classic style.  I would recommend it!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|so useful and time saving in my world. I love that you are able to customize it more than the android keyboard
0545091020|4.0|I found the audio version of Suzanne Collins THE HUNGER GAMES to be absolutely captivating.  I listened to this during a 30 minute commute to/from work as well as a 2.5 hr to/from trek to the airport.  Held my attention with well-rounded characters, well-paced plot and a well drawn world.  This is a must read for adults (and teens/kids) who enjoy well written fiction.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I thought this album was very good. It was a breath of fresh air in a musical drought. Some of the lyrics really caught me by surprise and I was so impressed by the lyricism of the album overall. The album had a lazy, somber feel to it that I really liked. My favorite song was \\"Melt My Heart to Stone\\" and \\"Best for Last\\". Anyone that buys this album won't regret it! ;^)
B004J4RQIM|5.0|Great artists - current as well as from \\"my day\\" (70's and 80's).  Great performances...  You'd have to really TRY to not love this DVD!
0312427999|5.0|I highly recommend this.  Incredibly relevant to today's problems and the solutions you are seeing floated.  I do hope you will pick it up and pass it on.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|this keyboard is amazing. 100x better than Swype. and couldn't resist considering it was free. Worth paying for it as well. thank you Amazon.
0743270754|5.0|Fresh angle, I thought, on Lincoln, worth reading even if you have read other biographies or think you know him.  Full of insights and warmth.
0553801473|3.0|My main points of criticism are the same that are put forward by other readers: The plot doesn't move forward. In fact instead of developing the already existing plotlines any further Martin invents a whole new one which seems to be completely unnecessary and which, like the others creeps forward at its best.<br /><br />The whole book is mainly chapters of charaters traveling, talking but never getting anywhere. Especially the Tyrion chapter where a labour to read and his new dwarf-companion a completely redundant add to the book.<br /><br />I wont pretend it was all bad. It is still Martin's work, well written (but a bit repetitious). I liked the chapters in the north from Ashas, Theons and sometimes Jons POV well enough. I really liked the Davos and the Arya chapters. The rest however felt like playing for time...
B000OIBY4Y|4.0|Good and worth reading. Strange little book.  My first Camus but quite enjoyable.  It will probably make you want to read more.
B004G6009K|5.0|The movie is cute and fun but most importantly the 3D actually is there. It could have more effects (couldn't they all?) but at least I don't feel totally ripped of with this one.
0393061310|3.0|I think the research and scope of this one alone was worth that Pulitzer. I am surprised it was so popular as I found it a very slow mover and not terribly easy to finish. Utterly fascinating insights though.<br /><br />Glad I can pick up something lighter now :-)
B004DK49DW|5.0|buy it. esp. if ur a social d. fan who's followed all their albums. seriously. it's the bomb. my fave track is &#34;still alive&#34; last song, so inspirational and perfect.
0684830485|5.0|As inspired as I was after \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", I am even more crushed by this one. If you have any idea of writing something real someday, steer well clear of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" What a genius work of character development and atmosphere.
B000026C3T|5.0|What can be said about The Zep that has not been said by every music critic on the planet-  So without being redundant, let me say that the quality of this recording alone is worth the price of the cds-  I, of course, have all their recorded music on cd, but the sonic improvement evidenced on this offering is worth the extra $20 invested-  The songs that they chose for this remaster was well thought out, although there are a few numbers not included that I would have liked to have seen as part of the offering-  Kashmir, Nobody's Fault But Mine, and Dazed and Confused have never sounded better on recorded music-  Aside from 'The Beatles' Led Zeppelin are probably the most important group to raise it's head in rock music-  To the young listeners who may not be very familiar with these legends, this would be the perfect place to start your journey into some of the greatest music to grace a past generation!
0743297334|5.0|I have a few really \\"favorite\\" writers.  Ernest Hemingway is on the shortest end of that shortlist, so... you are warned...<br /><br />I read this book for the first time, about three and a half years ago.  It was one of the first of my new period of intense reading, and it totally changed my focus as a reader, and a writer.  I just reread it aloud, with my best friend, and walked away with a completely renewed appreciation.<br /><br />As an aside, let me say, if you have never read a great book, aloud, with someone you love, with wine, and voices, and laughter, then you are missing a great opportunity to experience literature.  It is one of my favorite things in the world.<br /><br />Now to the book that changed all of literature:<br /><br />In this book we have the embodiment of the artist reinventing the medium.  Hemingway is throwing away, right before our eyes, so many literary conventions that we lose track.  What emerges is a new - completely new, way of writing.<br /><br />If you are writer, or aspire to write, and you come to Hemingway, you spend the whole time thinking, \\"How does he do that?\\" and your answer, of course, is \\"Hemingway was braver than you are.\\"  He was not afraid of reducing word count, of under-writing, and these fears bury a writer.<br /><br />Gone, largely, is plot as a straightjacket of narrative.  There is a story here, but it is not a story that \\"goes\\" anywhere, or begins, or ends.  These are just moments, and people.  Often they are fragmented, and incomplete, or incongruous, but they are \\"real\\" in a way that is difficult to achieve, and nearly impossible to achieve with the sparse toolbox Hemingway leaves himself.<br /><br />The Author gives us the realism of his favorite writers, and does them all better.  He is famously attributed with the quote, \\"....nobody's going to get me in any ring with Mr. Tolstoy...\\" but I think he underestimates himself.  By throwing away all the dusty trappings, he beats Tolstoy at his own game.<br /><br />Gone are the adjectives, the long, subordinate clauses that so many of us use, and over use, when we write, gone completely, is the convention of \\"telling\\" in favor of showing, and so much of that showing, for Hemingway, just boils down to dialogue.<br /><br />More than any other tool, Hemingway tells us a story with naked dialogue, stripped of adjectives and often stripped even of attribution.  You can see him cutting, taking away words that are unnecessary, and leaving the reader only what is left, to interpret as one would interpret a real experience.<br /><br />There is plenty of emotion in Hemingway, but it comes without a heavy handed authorship, and is so masterfully done, that is often missed, and its absence mocked by the critics.  His characters feel, care, love and fear, like any others, but they wear the masks of real life.<br /><br />Finally, on characters - This book has a cast of wonderful, memorable, characters.  They are well, if sparsely, drawn, and perhaps brought out best by the convention of out-loud reading.  It is easy to imagine Hemingway reading these passages aloud to himself, or to Hadley, to get the cadence right.<br /><br />The writing world is full of hack writers (most notably Stephen King) who crow about having learned the lessons of Hemingway, and then completely fail to produce a page of worthy prose.  If you have not discovered the source - The Sun Also Rises - do yourself a favor, and find a friend to read it with.<br /><br />There is certainly more to Hemingway than this book, which I would argue is not even his best, but here is where it really begins, for Hemingway, and for so much of 20th century American literature./>Gone are the adjectives, the long, subordinate clauses that so many of us use, and over use, when we write, gone completely, is the convention of \\"telling\\" in favor of showing, and so much of that showing, for Hemingway, just boils down to dialogue.<br /><br />More than any other tool, Hemingway tells us a story with naked dialogue, stripped of adjectives and often stripped even of attribution.

1595825045|5.0|I am so glad that I decided to get this book. The concept art behind the series is a phenomenal, intricate, and clever.<br />The amount of effort that went into making the series will forever be under appreciated.<br />I could go on for hours! I love this book!
1451629184|2.0|Of course this is an amazing story of survival and it is most definitely encouraging. I shed tears as I read the horryfic things that happened to this child (at that time). However, the BOOK itself was not written in a very interesting manner to where it just makes you want to keep reading it. The Cats chapter, oh my, I just wanted to close the book and stop reading it! I don't want to read about how much someone loves CATS. Yes it's heartbreaking, yes I know that the cats werevery important to Jaycee, I know that that helped her cope and what not, I can imagine the horror this poor child went through. As for the book ITSELF, in the way it was WRITTEN, I wouldn't say it was written in a very catching way and again, the cats , I get it! but maybe she should've summerized that part just a little bit?
1451629184|5.0|I am not much of a reader but knew I would be interested in her story.  Her story is so captivating and I find myself not being able to put this book down.  She describes in detail her entire ordeal and it just breaks my heart to what this poor little girl went through.  I watched her interview with Diane Sawyer and she didn't elaborate nothing like what she talks about in her book (which she said she wasn't going to), but seeing the interview and reading the book will make you understand what all she went through and what an AMAZING person she is to have survived all of horror she endured during those 18 years.  A truly facinating book and I cannot do anything but wish her the best in life and enjoy each day no matter what it brings.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Of course, with my 5-star review, you can tell that I like the songs on this CD, but others have reviewed the songs quite thoroughly, so I am opting to talk about the production. Full disclosure: I have known Butch Vig for many years--in fact I co-own a studio just down the street from his recently closed Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. So I am a bit biased, but Butch is an analog wizard. He plays the analog recording chain like Orli Shaham plays Scriabin on the piano, which is to say with a virtuoso's skill. Check it out: try listening a couple of times to the actual CD, rather than to a 128kbps MP3 file on your iPod (though it sounds good on the iPod too). This disc showcases great miking technique, mixing, production values and, perhaps most of all, the use of analog equipment as artforms in themselves. If you appreciate good songs, you'll like this disc; if you appreciate recording as an artform, you will LOVE this disc.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|This is a surprisingly excellent YES release best IMHO... since 90125...I've listened to YES music since 1970 (Chris Squire and Jon Anderson formed the band in 1968) ....and I have all their releases...I've always accepted YES music no matter who is in the Band at that time...it's a musical concept for musicians...no individual performer is YES...it's the sum of the parts! I love Jon Anderson's music with YES and Vangelis,and solo...and I have many of his releases too.....just because Jon isn't in it doesn't mean it should be dissed....Within the whole album \\"Fly From Here\\" I detect hints of.... very early YES,Drama,Pink Floyd,early Genesis,Queen,among other genres...a few songs have analog  Mini Moog synthesizer in them too...which I just love...from Geoff Downes on keys..from \\"ASIA\\"....The first song \\"We Can Fly\\" is over 20 min. done in segments.. it is excellent...and keeps you guessing.. What next?...But it doesn't smoothly segue between segmants as fluidly as does \\"Close To The Edge\\" which is 20 min long..circa 1972... Back to the new album...Howe is awesome as usual...Squire is right on top of his bass game...White does some fancy drumming, and then there is Benoit David (from Montreal) on lead vocals...he's just fine..but I noticed that Chris Squire's vocals....and a bit of Steve Howe's vocals would augment or harmonize with his vocals...this is a very well produced YES album by Trevor Horn....who sang on the YES album...DRAMA...
0812971825|5.0|Beautiful intimate examination of loss, grief and redemption. Faith and love can each be a dream, disappointment, mirage or a tower of strength. Highly recommend it.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I agree a Kindle is much easier to carry than even one book.  However, $10 more than Costco for the bundle and only $1 less for (e.g.) Game of Thrones is appalling to me.  The cost of delivering a Kindle (or any e-reader) book has got to be a fraction of the cost of printing/distributing a physical book - yet consumers are not seeing much in the way of savings - even after spending $100+ on a device.  Something needs to change.    Also, very disappointed to hear about the formatting/access issues.
B003Y5H53S|1.0|This movie should have never been rater PG. It is full of ideas and innuendos that a 4 year old should not watch. Horrible!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|John Cleese at his creative best.  I forgot how funny these were -- over 30 years ago and still fresh.  My only regret is that there were only two seasons.  Especially interesting are the recent interviews with the stars and commentary by writers, directors and producers.  Lots of laughs for the price!
0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey's BOSSYPANTS is a fun read which provides a lot of insight into what it's like to be a comedian, a comedy writer, and a woman.  I have to admit that I knew nothing at all about Fey until she began to do her Sarah Palin thing - I have never seen \\"Thirty Rock,\\" and I'm not an \\"SNL\\" regular.  But I do appreciate \\"Second City,\\" and Tina Fey's stories about what it's like for a woman trying to make her mark on a very male-dominated industry are priceless.<br /><br />I read this on my Kindle (gift from my son for my birthday a few months ago), and I remember laughing out loud more than a few times - including one rather embarrassing moment while I was proctoring an AP exam.  Fey can be sharply hysterical, brutally honest, and ultimately identifiable - she has all the same insecurities as the rest of us, but has found a way to make them work for her instead of against her.<br /><br />There's plenty in the book about \\"Thirty Rock\\" and how it came to be a hit, as well as plenty on Fey's meteoric rise playing Sarah Palin.  I find it impossible not to think of Fey whenever I see or hear Palin - and it's funny how little Fey had to do to turn Palin's own words into comedy gems.  BOSSYPANTS is great light reading.
B00003CWRX|4.0|Behind the scenes look at ruthless big business in general and the tobacco industry specifically.  Makes one wonder why anyone smokes today, unless the tobacco companies have found the most addictive chemical ever to add to their products.  Rather long winded storyline but rings true in the end:  Some people will do anything to succeed. . .
B004Y1USWQ|2.0|Steve Howe's acoustic song is beautiful but out of context, in my opinion.<br /><br />I am a big Yes fan  but....<br /><br />I agree 100% with FatElvis, who says that 'most of the performances are uninspired and lacking conviction'.  Indeed there are great moments here and there, some great passages and riffs but not much critical mass. Just a few good songs, i must sadly admit.<br /><br />I also agree that the solos of a keyboard wizard are missing. Isn't Yes about 'Kick ass' burning keyboard solos?<br /><br />Howe plays beautifully, but the songs are indeed kind of hollow and too simple for my taste after knowing what Yes can do musically.... You will freakin see what i am talking about.  It sounds a bit like Drama, but is nowhere near that great album.<br /><br />This record lacks Deepness as a unit, the Yes deepness which has been lost for quite a while.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|free version has way too many ads.. thanks for letting me try it for free.. OpenFeint kept appearing as well.. insert AOL GOODBYE
0061438294|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Essentially, it is about how to do something that we are never taught or socialized in how to do, which is interpreting the language of the body and the limbic brain (involuntary). Joe made the book easy to read, and kept everything very balanced in saying that the information shouldn't be used as saying that someone is definitely lying, but using body language to interpret the comfort level and stress levels of an individual once you know their base behavior. I thought his approach was great, and I learned a ton! Recommended!
B00003CXPD|5.0|Without a single shot being fired and with no endless car chases or agonizingly contrived kick-fights, Billy Elliot generates an emotional high, simply from a  plain, ordinary family living life with such great intensity, that it makes one want to cry at the happy ending. A happy ending. What a strange thing to find in a movie these days. The movie ends without generating hatred for anyone; even more strange.  The happiness comes only after sharing in the protagonist's heartrending battle, shared by many youths today, to be unconventional against the wishes of a conventional father. Unlike most movies with this theme, however, the father grows along with the son. The fact that the movie is English and you are not familiar with the cast makes the movie totally believable. One is not blinded by the celebrity of the actors and makes it easy to accept the ordinariness of the family, which is vital to the dynamics of the movie. Need an emotional high? Want to replace the amount of blood shed for an equal amount of tears, both happy and sad? This movie is for you.

B0051MKNV8|5.0|It's rare to watch a movie that seems more clever, and has more unexpected twists as the movie goes along.  In the first part, it seemed a little slow, but I still would have given it 4-stars.  By the end, it was 5-stars, because of the way the story unexpectedly developed.  Plus, I loved the ending.  (not the alternate, but the actual). Great acting.  Loved it, and am going to watch it again!
B004A8ZX2I|5.0|The end will surprise those that have not already seen the movie. When the movie began, the ending was not at all what I expected. At first it seemed rather dull but progressed rapidly into a relatively interesting story. Good for a change from other movies that are making the rounds.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|When I bought my new laptop, it came with a FW800 port instead of FW400 ports. I use several audio recording interfaces and some hard drives that are FW400.  The FW800 and FW400 ports are electrically compatible but need either adaptors or special cables with one of each type of end connector. If I'd have bought new cables with one of each end type, I'd have ended up buying several cables of different lengths for various gear setups. Quality FW cables are pretty expensive. With this adaptor, I can use the firewire 400 cables I already own.  The Moshi seems well built, and as far as I can tell it works fine.  It arrived USPS within a few days of placing the order.

0316056863|5.0|Bossypants is a book that I appreciated on so many levels, because it works on so many levels.  As the product description blurb here says, it is a messy book, so don't come at it expecting a nice, ordered progression of Fey's life story.  Yet, this messiness really works for it.  Reading it is like sitting down for a cup of coffee and having a chat with Fey, just listening while one thought leads to another, resulting a sort of stream-of-consciousness to the narrative.    There's a reason why Tina Fey is so engaging.  She is witty, self-deprecating, and smart.  All of those come through in this book.  However, though she is a comic genius, she also seems to be infused with a real humbleness.  She never tries to pretend that she's perfect or that her life is perfect.  She readily admits to obnoxious behavior and moments of stupidity.  When you read this, you can't help but feel like she's one of your good friends, that you have a relationship in which you're comfortable admitting your flaws to one another.  The fact that she's so downright human is a big part of Fey's appeal.  She's not trying to be a princess or a super glamorous girl.  Instead, she's the way most of us women secretly are: relieved when we can put on our messy sweats, scrape our hair back into a ponytail, and flop down on the couch.  I think this really comes through in the hilarious section about doing photo shoots.      Fey's determination is also very appealing to me.  She has a lot of guts, as the book shows.  She's taken risks and fought to make her way in a world that is often uncomfortable, if not downright inhospitable to women.  When I read about her experiences in the business, in how she has dealt with the notion that people aren't interested in women comics, I really admired her resolve.  There is a clear feminist message here, and Fey perfectly illustrates how, while overt sexism is perhaps becoming a thing of the past, there is still that patronizing, insidious kind of sexism that isalive and well.  I'm thrilled that women like Fey are proving that they can be every bit as funny as men, and that their humor can appeal to a broad swath of the population.  It's thrilling to see someone using her brains, wit, and savvy to get ahead, rather than falling back on tired stereotypes of women as toys.    The motherhood sections of the book are also priceless.  As the mother of a daughter, I could really relate to the \\"prayer\\" Fey includes.  It's so hilarious that it had me laughing until I teared up.  I agreed with every single sentiment, and loved the way Fey can take motherly anxieties and find a way to laugh about them.  Her struggle with her desire to have another baby conflicting with her career ambitions is also particularly poignant.  This is a very real struggle for many people.  I felt a real rush of affection for her as I read her section about breast feeding.  This can be a real taboo subject with women, and I was heartened to see Fey take a clear stance on it, exposing it for the struggle that it truly can be.      But much of the book is like this: Fey takes the gloss off a subject, shows it's ugly underbelly, and then pokes fun at it.  Like the rest of us, she can be neurotic, tactless, cranky, and stressed, she just really, really good at finding a way to laugh about it.  As a result, Bossypants is good therapy.
B000002X1O|4.0|Baron Von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun features a style that I believe is quite different from previous Paul Kantner albums, and seriously a drastic step away from anything Jefferson Airplane or Jefferson Starship ever wrote.   It's not necessarily a fantastic departure either.  The music sounds partially aimless or undeveloped sometimes, and just severely dated in other areas.  An inconsistent affair.  The highlights are two magnificent songs that I will mention below, and three or four other really good ones.    \\"Your Mind Has Left Your Body\\" is perhaps the most unique song on the entire album.  It takes elements of country music in the guitar playing and combines it with hypnotic and dreamy singing.  The vocal melody definitely reminds me of the guy from the Incredible String Band.  I doubt it's an imitation though, since the Incredible String Band already had their moment in the sun long before this album was released.  To be perfectly honest, it's hard to rate a song like this and I can't tell you if I actually enjoy it or not.  I *think* I do.  Nothing about the song really does a whole lot besides linger on and on, but thanks to the lyrics, the feeling of adventure is still quite evident.  That and the country-inspired guitar work is the greatest aspect of the song.  Normally I don't believe you have to be on drugs to get the full effect of a song but... well, haha.    \\"Sketches of China\\" has an unavoidably depressing feeling thanks to Grace's vocals.  This song hits me pretty hard because you can tell it's designed to destroy someones mental state of mind... or perhaps not.  The lyrics wouldn't necessarily indicate such inner devastation.  In fact, the melody is supposed to give the listener an uplifting and positive feeling.  As far as I know, it's about the child Paul and Grace made together.  The harmonies are extraordinary though.  Absolutely the very best I've ever heard the two of them create.  The guitar solos are enough to send me to a faraway land aswell.   Well, I can't sit here and talk about THIS song all day when there's flowers outside that need watered and other songs that need discussed!      \\"Across the Board\\" is another Grace Slick highlight.  Describing the brilliance of the vocal melody would be impossible, or rather, would make me look like a fanboy who can't listen to music objectively.  Not for me!  Let's just say, this is yet another terrific performance that takes advantage of her incredible range.  Somehow her range becomes even better as the song progresses.  \\"Flowers of the Night\\" has another military march-like vocal melody (as I prefer to call it- perhaps there's a more appropriate name for those type of vocal melodies) that resembles a good portion of Paul Kantner's Sunfighter album.  Not a highlight for me, but perhaps others can find some appeal in it.  It's a major low point of the album for me and if it wasn't for the decent guitar solo at the end I would dismiss it without hesitation.     \\"White Boy\\" has another underwhelming vocal melody that does nothing interesting.  The lyrics seem to focus on questioning our existence and human accomplishments concerning white people, and while interesting, it's not enough to make the mediocre vocal melody worth sitting through.  A song that I believe wasn't worked on entirely because the melody should have matched the quality of the lyrics but unfortunately, it doesn't.   However, it's not a bad song.  I just wish more attention was given to the actual vocal melody.  \\"Harp Tree Lament\\" is really good though, thanks entirely to the vocal melody and nothing else.   Sure, there's a degree of dated fruitiness to it, but it's not enough to distract me from the vocals.  Grace's vocals on \\"Fat\\" are flat (har har!)  A far cry from tunes like \\"Across the Board\\" and \\"Sketches of China\\" that's for sure, but... I still really like it.  Oh, even though \\"Fishman\\" is really short,  the vocal melody appeals to me a lot.  I admire the way Grace's vocals build indramatic fashion very slowly, and then the chorus eventually comes in and explodes.  Good moment.  Another magnificent Grace Slick performance.      Repeated listens reveals an album that *does* improve.  My original feelings weren't so kind, but now I believe I can appreciate a good portion of the album, especially any moment when Grace Slick is in the spotlight (which happens often, might I add).
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I had never heard of age of zombies, or monster dash for that matter, until this was app of the day. super fun addictive game, love the Sly Stallone ripoff Barry Steakfries.  word of warning to nexus one owners. the multitouch digitizer on the n1 is not as good as other smartphones out there so you may run into some trouble with dual stick shooters like these. otherwise this game is great!

B004XJHBCE|5.0|Moving from Blackberry to Android, I missed the folder organizer. With all the apps, it's hard to get to the apps without scrolling up & down on the app page. The paid version of Folder Organizer let you organize and customize your folder. The settings is very easy to use. It's been a time saver for everything. You can preset to organize the apps as you download them and organize them immediately. It's a must have app. I am lost without it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|At last, a superior and sophisticated game that challenges the brain without stimulating the adrenal glands. I'm so glad I didn't automatically mute the sound like I do for other games! Playing this actually RELAXES me with its beautiful soundtrack, gorgeous graphics and thoughtful game play. Worth much more than 99&cent;. More like this one, please!
B0055D3EOG|2.0|I didn't find this movie even slightly scary, or entertaining. A poor rehash of the much better done Poltergeist. I spent the movie being bored or rolling my eyes. Finally had to shut it off with 30 minutes to go.
0307887960|5.0|It is no small surprise that this book is popular in France and in the US now.  It is laid out logically, and is written in a clear, accessible format.  It explains a plan to lose weight which is similar but not identical to the Atkins Diet. What is explained in this book that's revolutionary, is three steps past the crash diet. There is the diet, the cruise version (adding veggies), the maintenance plan (with a precise way to calculate how long to follow it) and then a precise formula for how to keep off the weight for life.  It is a book that makes sense and the diet has given me results in just a few weeks. Even Dr. Oz has spoken positively of it.
B003Y5H5AG|3.0|At the advanced screening, young kids loved this movie.  Although they tended to like the animated sections, I personally loved the interactions with Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays.  These two actors were perfect for those movie and make you fall in love with them.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I found this by accident and enjoyed it immensely.  I like Mads' acting in this and other films I've seen.  Long movie, but in this case, I enjoyed the unraveling of the plot.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|First of all, I can understand why a woman might find this movie a bit degrading, but for a man, he'd have to be extremely gay to hate it. This movie has everything that a guy could dream of: scifi, fantasy, history, epic battles, amazing picture quality, and girls in sexy little outfits. What more could you possibly want? lol    Also, it had a pretty good soundtrack. You'll be totally transfixed by Emily Browning's voice (main actress) when you hear her sing Sweet Dreams. After the movie, I had to find it and download it so I could listen to it over and over.
B0018LX9T4|3.0|While watching the video, the sound from scene to scene would vary on volume, and there was a random buzzing sound from scene to scene. My TV is fine, and my DVD player works fine. tested it on my TV and laptop. sound on both were off.

B005BW0TO4|1.0|I think 3 Doors Down is a case of a band that just cannot change their sound or the tone of their music.  I agree with several reviewers that said it all sounds the same because it does!  Other than a few songs with some added instrumentation, everything sounds the same, the way he sings, the tone, there just isnt any versatility or adventure in the music at all.  I think this started with the last CD which for me got boring fast!  This is more of the same, but only worse!  I think 3 Doors should have begun experimenting in different directions a couple albums ago and try to break some new ground.  Even change the vocal style or add some other vocals and background singers into the mix.  Change the style of the songs, more uplifting sounding songs.  I cant help but to think of Train \\"Hey Soul Sister\\", they really added a change up on their surprising new CD last year!  Train was starting to get into that bland mode too 2 albums ago.  I liked 3 Doors Down first few CDs but it's kinda like Boston in a way (one of my favorite classic rock bands).  They were great their first 3 albums as well but they never changed a thing about their music and they remain well known mostly for the first album and for their first few releases.  Classic rock wasn't even known for blandness but alt rock is worse and 3 Doors Down fits that category too well unfortunately!
1463514581|5.0|This book was a great read and once you get started, it really is hard to put down. Even with a toddler in the house I somehow managed to read it in about two days.<br /><br />I was attracted to the book by the blurb, it seemed quirky enough that I would like, and I saw there was an overbearing mother in the picture. Having one myself I was interested. I have to say that the character of 'Momma' and the affect she has on her children seems very authentic. I could understand why Rose, the daughter that stayed behind to care for the cruel mother, was the way she was, and why her sister 'the one who got away' was the way she was too. I liked how the dynamic plays out later in the book between the sisters and found them particularly engaging.<br /><br />The characters are very real. None of them 100% perfect all of the time. Sometimes they infuriate you or make you slap her head, while in the next scene make you giddy, or a little teary.<br /><br />The book is often witty and Rose's take on situations are sometimes laugh out loud funny. There are some twists and many secrets revealed throughout the book. Some more unexpected than others, but once revealed, you definitely feel an 'ah-ha' moment. The scenes are described beautifully, never with more description than needed, which is just what I like. I've been known to only glaze over overly descriptive passages in most of the books I read, so this was a definite plus for me.<br /><br />I'd recommend the book to anyone who likes a coming of age story, murder mystery, or a romance. Rose a great heroine who is stronger than she thinks right from the beginning. It'll be interesting to see with her new found confidence where the next book in the series will take her.
0143034901|4.0|i thoroughly enjoyed this novel. it was engrossing and sent me to far away lands. it was filled with drama, intrigue, and romance beautifully portrayed. i recommended it to my daughter and she found it to be equally enchanting. kudos to carlos ruiz zafon!
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I loved the leisurely pace of The Tourist and as the film unfolded I had no idea of what was to come, which in my mind is a good thing.  The Italians were so authentically portrayed I thought I was in Italy again, and Venice overwhelmed me with its beauty.  The bad men were really bad and the police, Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton, brought a grounded reality to the film.  As for Rufus Sewell, he's great in everything he does, as is Bettany and Dalton. Jolie, a strong actress (who doesn't take herself seriously) and Depp worked well together and I was surprised and entertained throughout the entire film.  A refreshing break from the standard panic/manic paced indulgent American films.  (Think Tom Cruise, who I do like but he needs to make better quality films).
B000PKG7I4|5.0|This is a sad day in music history. Amy Winehouse 14 September 1983 - 23 July 2011, was one of the most underrated singers of this modern time. Aside from the loss to family and friends, the music industry has lost a great talent. True she was responsible for a lot of her actions, fame, mental illness, drugs, and the demands assisted in the loss of this young talent. What could've been? No one now will know. She only recorded two albums but had several live performances memorialized found on you tube where she wasn't high or drunk. I would suggest that people go and look them up. For sure the industry will now pull out all of her other \\"gems\\"...it's always the same...you're worth more dead than alive...industry will begin to release albums and videos that were not previously released....The Frank album is fantastic glimpse of what was to come and boy did it come when she released the Grammy winning Back to Black. For a young 20 year old this album is fantastic. Now we can only do what we've been doing for some years now: look at the videos listen to these albums.. and wonder...what great troubled artist is next? It is easy to laugh, call her names, said she had no talent (I think the talentlessness label was becoming appropriate due to her behavior in the final years)...this is easy to say especially in the US where the most exposure she got on the radio was \\"Rehab\\". We must remember she was a human being who was loved by many and is now gone. Let us remember.
B0058FOB2K|4.0|Each time she releases a solo album, I hear or read at least one interview in which Beyonce states a desire to create \\"timeless, classic music\\".  I kinda rolled my eyes because in my opinion, she has not ever created either a cohesive entire album OR anything resembling timeless music - she has created some really memorable pop moments but honestly I don't reach for a Beyonce cd when I need a musical pick-me-up.  I actually bought this album from Target for my nephew but ripped it to the computer so I could give it a listen.<br /><br />It's definitely a collection that I've listened to a few times to let the songs marinate on my brain.  As I listened, I likened this album to Mariah Carey's BUTTERFLY in that both women tried to break away from their prior personas by creating music opposite of what they'd done in the past.  Mariah stated that she'd always loved r&b and hip hop but had been pushed into the ballad queen/adult contemporary genre while Beyonce achieved popularity through her pop-laced r&b/hip hop tracks.<br /><br />I'm very pleasantly surprised by this album - after the dreadful RUN THE WORLD (GIRLS) was released, I fully expected another boring \\"Sasha Fierce\\" album so I had very low expectations but this album as a whole is quite good.  I do, however give Bee props for sticking by her decision to release this single and support it even after it received an overwhelmingly negative response.  (I think she was more excited to release the video to show off the dance moves as opposed to releasing the song itself which has proved deadly to kicking off this album's promotion.)<br /><br />I agree with a previous poster that the musical arrangements of each song is stellar and on some songs I would've suggested Beyonce sing more subtly because her oversinging ruins songs that I would have really liked otherwise.  I applaud her effort to \\"bring r&b back to the forefront\\" and enjoy the 80's & 90's flavored tracks - they are very enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />Instant favorites:<br /><br />PARTY - this is the perfect summer track, it's breezy, fun and not too long.  The rappers (Andre 3000 & Kanye) don't overpower the song.  This definitely should've been a first single contender!<br /><br />RATHER DIE YOUNG - her vocals @ the beginning of the song are so sweet & ethereal.  The lyrics are sweet too and seem to be directed to her husband.<br /><br />LOVE ON TOP - another perfect summer track, it has an early '90s sound that's very catchy.  Not quite strong enough to have led off the album but still an enjoyable track.<br /><br />COUNTDOWN - addictive uptempo track although I love the \\"countdown\\" chorus more than the actual song lyrics.<br /><br />END OF TIME - love the musical arrangements but she starts to sing a little too hard during the song which lessens my enjoyment of it.<br /><br />I CARE - very raw emotional sounding vocals from Bee expressing the pain she feels from an indifferent lover.  I like it but again at a certain point it seems like she's screaming and that takes away from the song.  I do love the guitar arrangement and her singing along with the chords.<br /><br />I MISS YOU - really enjoy this down-tempo track!  Her vocals are low-key and perfectly suited to it.  She should try more of this type of musical/vocal arrangement.<br /><br />BEST THING I NEVER HAD - melodic, catchy lyrics and although not as strong as other tracks this one seems to be gaining ground on the r&b charts.<br /><br />The tracks that I think are ok are: START OVER - again great musical production matched with almost screaming vocals (I tried but just cannot with this song); 1+1 - if she'd sung a little softer, I might have been able to get into the song but after repeated listens, I just don't care for it and I WAS HERE - although the lyrics are sentimental & heartfelt, this song seems out of place on the album and might have worked better as a hidden track.<br /><br />Of the bonus tracks I really like SCHOOLIN' LIFE - has a Prince-vibe production wise but goes on a little too long for my liking & LAY UP UNDER ME - Bee sounds great and the arrangement of the song reminds me of the Human League's DON'T YOU WANT ME BABY (I don't know if others hear it but that song comes to mind whenever I play this track).<br /><br />I don't care for the RUN THE WORLD remixes primarily because I dislike the original so much and probably haven't given these songs much of a chance.<br /><br />Although this album may not sell as well as her previous ones, it is a step forward for me in my opinion of Beyonce.  I think that she truly put together the album that SHE wanted and is letting the chips fall as they may.  She is one of the best (if not THE best) entertainer of her generation and I'm sure the songs from this album will translate beautifully in her concerts.<br /><br />I'm not sure what people expected of Beyonce but given a lot of negative commentary about this album it truly reminds me of those expressed by Mariah fans about the BUTTERFLY album and just as Mariah weathered the storm and has continued to release great music and garnered a different fan base, I believe Beyonce will do the same.arrangement of the song reminds me of the Human League's DON'T YOU WANT ME BABY (I don't know if others hear it but that song comes to mind whenever I play this track).

B004Y1USV2|4.0|It would be easy to pan this album because it doesn't really have the historic classic progressive rock sound (at least consistently) throughout the recording.  Folks we need to remember it's not 1971 anymore.  We are all older and these guys (with the exception of Benoit David) are probably all close to or over 60. I find myself falling into a deep \\"like\\" of this album. These guys can make good music without Jon Anderson.  David is a versatile vocalist (more range that Trevor Horn on Drama).  This is a better album overall than Drama, which you have to compare it to with Horn and Downes present and Anderson absent. The songwriting is better, and the musicianship is as good or better. It sounds like Yes, Asia (hey it's half Asia!) and King Crimson and none of these comparisons is a bad thing.  Will it sweep you away like Close to the Edge? (no chance} Will it inspire you with it's epic nature like Tales? (not likely).  Will it blow you away with it's vocal harmonies? (it might).  Some other observations besides the well known (Squire and Howe are the still at the top of their game), Squire could probably carry the band vocally if needed, the songwriting of the group has greatly improved in 31 years (Drama to now).  If you're longing for Anderson's soaring vocals or Wakeman's tremendous keyboard work don't buy this album and then criticize it.  Yeah I miss that too, but this is good also.  Like I said it's not 1971 anymore.
B005869U6G|3.0|The songs on If Not Now, When? are enchanting, even haunting at times but the songs all sound like you'd be hearing them on your way to the 36th floor...that's right, I said it. The only song that comes close to a \\"hard\\" song is Switchblade and even that sounds like a filler track. You won't find any Digs, Stellars, Anna Mollys or Nice To Know You's on this album.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I read enough books that I can get myself to stop at a reasonable hour so that I may go to bed. If I stayed up every night that I was reading a good book, I would have a poor sleep schedule.<br />Can you guess why I started off my review talking about sleeping? No? Maybe because I was up until 3 AM finishing this book. 3. AM. Generally I am a 11 PM sleeper. So this is kind of a big deal. In fact, the night that I stayed up that late was the night I was up early to go to a book trade show, which makes it even more extraordinary.<br /><br />I love a good contemporary book, and Anna and the French Kiss certainly falls into this category. In fact, I would say this is a GREAT, AWESOME contemporary young adult book. Stephanie Perkins has writing that flows from one chapter to the other, from character to character, scene to scene. My emotions were on high alert, and my heart wouldn't let me sleep until I finished and knew what came of Anna and her friends.<br /><br />The romance and friendships in Anna and the French Kiss are beautifully written, and realistic - which is not always the case. I smiled, I laughed, I was worried, I was happy, I ached. I LOVED this book. I also like that it's a December release because it would be great to read cozied up to a fire with a big blanket.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins is one of the top contemporary young adult books of 2010.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Loved the movie. But HATE the Amazon Instant Vid. Why should a 1 hour 45 min movie take 2 hours and 10 min to watch???? Because Amazon Instant Vid kept stopping. Sick and tired of this system. I want my $3.99 back!!!
B0045U9WPU|5.0|Ok. My reviewing process starts with giving the book a star rating on Goodreads immediately after I finish, based on how the book made me feel overall. I rarely ever give one or two stars, because one or two stars (to me) would mean I didn't finish the book, and I don't rate those.<br />Delirium, for me, started off between three and four stars. It moved a little slow for me, and I wasn't connecting with the characters. When I read Matched by Ally Condie, I got into it all right away - and because these books have a similar characteristic in the plot (being matched up with your life partner), I inadvertently judged Delirium more quickly than I generally would.<br /><br />I had no intention of quitting, though. I didn't hit page 50 and think to myself, man I really want to stop reading - it wasn't THAT slow. It just wasn't living up to my Matched expectation (which isn't fair, but is the way it works).<br /><br />Thankfully, the world started to form and the fate of the narrator started to matter to me. About halfway through the book the action scenes start to pick up, and by the last quarter you get mad when anyone interrupts your reading. In Delirium, individuals are \\"cured\\" of love at age eighteen, so the descriptions of emotions are very compelling and deep. Once Lena starts to discover some of the emotions the society is attempting to stifle, you begin to care about her.<br /><br />The second half of this book was so great that it ended up getting a 5 star Goodreads rating. Chapter after chapter of shocking discoveries, twists, action. The first half did not give me near the same feelings as the second half - and I'm sad about that, but as I said in my opening sentences, my ratings are based on my overall feelings at the end, and the end made me FEEL. I don't cry much while reading and I teared up at times. Oh Lauren Oliver and her ability to write emotion.<br /><br />Delirium may not be for everyone - the alternate world can be intimidating if you haven't read a lot of dystopia - but this is one I really did enjoy as a whole.I really did enjoy as a whole.
B000NVL1XQ|2.0|This dvd would not play in any of my players.  It is an HD DVD which is not compatabile with modern blue ray or dvd players bought at walmart or players on any of my computers.  The dvd is not even recognized.  I guess I should have read the offering closer.  It was so cheap that it's not worth trying to return it.
0545259088|5.0|I asked for Shiver for Christmas a few years ago because it was raved about quite a bit. I thought it was a pretty good read. I read Linger months later, and liked it quite a bit more than Shiver (the world of Sam and Grace had already been built so there was more room for action).<br /><br />I read Forever and liked it five times more than Linger because it was AMAZING.<br /><br />I guess now would be the time for me to admit that for the first 25 pages of Forever I was utterly, totally confused. Forever is from four points of view, and so much happened at the end of Linger that I couldn't keep it all straight in my head. I ended up having to read a spoilery review of Linger to get the gist of it all flowing the right way in my head again (so I strongly suggest you reread or do a little research before starting this one).<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater's writing is simply beautiful. Even those that didn't care much for Shiver commented on how wonderful her writing is, and she does not disappoint in the final installment of The Wolves of Mercy Falls. It jumps us right to where Linger left off, and from there we are right back with Grace, Isabel, Sam, and Cole.<br /><br />The middle of Forever got a little long for me, but that's my only complaint. The last third of the book flew by and had my heart pounding. Steifvater doesn't use predictable outcomes to satisfy the reader, which was my favorite part - she wrote this book in a real, true way, and it resonated with me as a reader.<br /><br />It's not often that I love the last book in a series much much more than the others, but there is no denying that Forever surpasses both Shiver and Linger in my mind.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I'm glad I spent a few extra bucks on this cooler, as the stock cooler looked terrible. It has been very effective in keeping my CPU cool. It's usually in the low 30 range at idle, with the other cores in the 20s. It's never been hotter than the 50s under load. The price for what you get is outstanding. I'd strongly recommend this product.    One caveat I should mention is that this thing is rather large. I have a huge HAF 932 Advanced case, so no worries for me, but make sure you have enough room if  you are planning on squeezing this into a smaller case.
B000B5MI3Q|2.0|I bought one of these watches in 1985. It was a tank. It took much abuse and kept on running. Because of the heaviness of the watch the band would break often and hit the asphalt/concrete. After a few years of repeated bonking on the hard surfaces it finally quit. (I wish i had put a good fabric band on it). Anyway, i bought one of these watches last year (2010) and it was a creampuff. Any jar to my arm and it would stop running. Very disappointing. This is the only watch i really desire to own, but because of the unreliability i had to leave it in the fond memories of yesteryear. ( I actually bought a sport model Seiko automatic before i made this purchase in 2010---same problem. I sent both watches back and opted for the SKA413.) Inferior construction/materials for the automatics nowadays? Not sure.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|My fingers are crossed that \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is the beginning of a series comparable to Harry Potter.  Jacob Portman loves his grandfather and his stories.  As Jacob matures, he realizes that his grandfather's stories might not be true.  However good old granddad has photos to reinforce up his tall tales.  Jacob grows into a normal mediocre teenager.  His life as a normal ends when he finds his grandfather dying after a gruesome vicious attack.  His grandfather leaves him a cryptic message and then boom dies.<br /><br />Therapy and parental concern do not help Jacob.  His therapist endorses Jacob visiting the island where his grandfather lived in an orphanage.<br /><br />Oh what a delicious book this is--fantasy, adventure and pure creative thinking pervade this book.  I fell in love with Jacob and his new island friends and learned a new lexicon for things that go bump in the night.<br /><br />Now how does this tie into Harry Potter.  I remember I was the first in my circle of readers to read \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\".  The feeling that book gave me mirrors the feeling I get with this book.  I watched Harry grow up and now I miss him but I feel Jacob could be my next Harry.<br /><br />I also love this author's writing style--fluid is the word that comes immediately to my mind when reading this book.  The fluidity of his writing changed depending on what was occurring in the story at the time.  From a lazy river, to a rough ocean, this book was magical.
B00009XITQ|5.0|I love watching this movie over and over again. I ordered the movie but didn't expect to receive it so quickly.  It was just a few days & was packaged that it wouldn't move within the box. It came to me in great shape.
0062060554|4.0|The brain is complicated, complex, fascinating and dynamic.  Bless Christine's heart; she forgets everything when she goes to sleep.  Imagine waking up not knowing your past, your husband who is sleeping beside you or how you came to be 46 when the last thing you do remember is being 26.<br /><br />This book is a thriller along the same vein as \\"Shutter Island\\" by Dennis Lehane.  What makes this book fascinating is how Christine's mind works and how her intuitive nature confirms or negates what her brain is thinking.  Neither her brain power nor her intuition hold true 100% of the time, so there is a ton of gray area in Christine's life.<br /><br />It is wonderful to watch Christine decode who she is and what her history consists of...and her history is not particularly lovely in some arenas.  When I realized that the author was male, I was surprised.  He understands what it is to be woman in intimate detail.<br /><br />I am not sure that I could have been friends with Christine when she was in her youth.  Her ego is quite inflated and she thinks she is quite the sex goddess babe.  Her condition makes her self-centered but her basic soul begins to shine forth as she learns more about whom she actually is, her history and how her past actions directly influenced where she is now...<br /><br />This book is well-written and articulate.  This book is a page-turner and great entertainment.
B0045U9WPU|5.0|So I have to say that this book is one of the BEST books that I have ever read. I have started to follow this author since her debut Before I Fall. Which is one of the finest literary pieces I have ever layed eyes on. I honestly thought that after that book nothing even by her could complete. But I was so wrong. This book has exclisped every distopia novel I have ever read and maybe question anything that might stop me reading the book.      A lot of people have compared it to Hunger Games but I think Declaration by Gemma Malley is more appriate though with more of the hot emotion of Hunger Games. The book a story about a country who no longer allows love is fresh and new and is a topic many many people even outside of the young adult audience can understand. Its scary this sensorship inpart because while we experice minor senorships, the idea of no love AT ALL is one so scary and at the same time on the surface we don't think of as being that bad. Its interesting to read about a culture so familiar and yet so foreign, to see blatent errors in its construct and to see so much silent hatred its scary to know that its only in a book and only words typed on a page.      Lauren Oliver brings a work that allows us to question not just the fictional society but ours as well. There is so much humanity in the fictional society that you become a citizen and you become part of the resistance. You feel on a level you never have before and you experience ideas and experiences never before possible from your chair or bed where you read.      You will be a fool not to read this book whether you are 12 or 101 there is something all of us as a people can learn. Its a book that will shake you to your core and will leave you wanting more, even though you are scared and what that more could entail for your favorite characters.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Count me IN . Wonderful and TRUE story of a great woman and her great horse and team , springs from a super duper tradition of a great script and a solid cast . I'm thrilled to see films such as this , still being made . Critics be darned . This IS a swell time at the movies . Are there flaws ? Certainly . Who'd be chulish enough to ferret them out though ? Similar to THE BLIND SIDE in that it WILL make you HAPPY . Thrilling and smart . Delightful and highly recommended . The opposite end of the mordant spectrum .

B000I5SY9Q|5.0|great classic movie!
0061726826|3.0|I'm pretty surprised that I got through this one! It was okay, the premise interested me and it's pretty true to the book jacket. It WAS slow, which is something that usually bothers me, but the gorgeous writing helped me get through it. I mean, this is like poetry. That's what Lauren Oliver is best at - pacing, reasoning behind actions, eh, not so much.    Additionally, an altercation in the middle of the book contained a strong expletive. This was uncomfortable to me, and younger readers and parents should be aware of this.    AND, apparently this is a trilogy. You should know this before you read it. The shocker ending was infuriating when I initially read it, but knowing that it is a trilogy helps. However, I may or may not continue reading. Depends on what direction they're headed in.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|Even though it includes Superman IV, I still recommend it.  Watching it with my 12 year old son has been a blast.
B004FEJ3VY|3.0|I bought this for a four year old I mind each week.  He had been playing with my sons (now 22 & 24) hand me down first generation Transformers but thought he would like some modern ones.  This is far too complicated for him to transform - he easily manages the original Optimus Prime.  To be fair the box says 5+ and he is only 4 and a quarter.  So now I am on the search for some easier models.  On the other hand when my 24 year old visited and I handed him the half transformed toy and requested he make it into a truck he bluntly refused the instructions and cracked it in 5 minutes.
1451629184|5.0|Although this book was difficult to read at times due to the graphic nature, it's a must read. The strength that Jaycee showed through impossible situations is inspirational. This book is a must have for any book collector! It also helps Jaycee when you support her book which she deserves! Great book! I couldn't put down.
B0055D3EOG|3.0|Two thirds of a great film. Amazing score, good cast, and plausible reactions to what starts off to be a fairly reasonable tale of haunting. I found myself grinning as I was thinking this was the long overdue return to form for a genre that I consider dead. Things start to fall apart as the third act begins. A movie concerning any topic than is not fully understood, but told in a realistic manor, should never explain the unknown. The movie switches from haunting to supernatural rescue and too many answers are given and too much paranormal activity is shown for a hardened movie cynic to suspend his disbelief. I feel a smart movie should present all the evidence and leave a viewer to draw their own conclusion. The ending is horrible and I feel all movies that end with such a cheap shot should come with a warning. So you are warned -- the ending is abrupt and totally unsatisfying. I guess you could label it as surprising if this is the first horror movie you have ever seen. I cant understand why any movie would end in the middle of a scene other than a writer being unable to write anything worthwhile and trying to play it off as clever. BOO!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|While everyone else was out partying at frat parties, I reminder studying with my friends at the library for chemistry tests. I wish this show was on when I was in college. I can totally relate.
B004ZQBOK0|4.0|The first album put out by these guys in 2010 left allot to be desired. I thought there were two good songs. Sweet Blasphemy is excellent. However, there seemed to be some potential under the surface. Something you can't really explain but I felt like maybe some \\"ifs\\" needed to happen and then this band could really be something. Move ahead a little over a year and a new lead guitarist, that blew me away, and a \\"wow\\" drummer. The \\"ifs\\" happened. The lead singer, Andy Sixx, sounds like Brett Michaels from Poison, one of his childhood idols, and he's a bit nasally at times. Sixx is a good frontman though. He also talks about Motley Crue being an influence. I personally don't hear it in the music as I feel BVB are far more agressive and faster paced in every way and I believe more talented. They are so young and yet seem to be so far along musically. I read the Avenged Sevenfold comparisons and I'm going to have to disagree. It's an insult to BVB. Avenged Sevenfold has two good guitarist, but quite frankly, I believe the band is overrated, the singer is horrible and musically there isn't anything there I like. But I do like Black Veil Brides. I would compare BVB more to a goth band like AFI that has taken there music to a harder level. AFI, by the way, also has excellent guitar playing and can rock with the best of them. There are a number of songs that sound very much like them. Set The World On Fire makes you look forward to the next album, which is what it is supposed to do. For me, the title track, Love Isn't Always Fair, The Legacy and I Would Die For You are the best on this album. I hope that this lineup stays together and continues to progress.
0553801473|1.0|Its all been said. Instead of clarifying and trimming down excess loose ends for a more cohesive story this book does the opposite. No resolution to any of the existent plots with an additional half dozen pointless and meandering arcs that go nowhere. The events of this book could be condensed into 300 pages and nothing would have been lost. There is absolutely no reason Feast and Dance could not have been a single novel, none. 60% of this book is strange humiliation porn, description of food, ships, traveling while going nowhere and additional story-lines that have no reason to be included. The plot has not progressed one inch from Feast.<br /><br />And the haphazard way the story ends is simply insulting. I am a big fan of Martin but its simply hack writing to have so much dead weight followed by cliffhangers (and using the term cliffhanger is being very generous)to the only substantial plot develops the novel sees.<br /><br />1000 pages and 6 years and the story goes nowhere. Such a disappointment. Judged on its own this is a 2.5 star book. But coming from the lineage of Martin this book deserves 1 star.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Simply brilliant . A time sink. well animated. joy to play. Phone gets hot while playing though, don't know why.
0061784788|4.0|Good book.  Very well written.  A bit of a stetch as far as believability, however; it moved very well and kept me interested through the entire read.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good fictional novel.
B0046E825G|5.0|For all the twilight fans out there, This book is the best and last of the series. There is tons of action. There is about 700-800 pages in this book. Also the book is split into three parts: Part 1 Bella's perspective, Part 2 Jacob's perspective, and Part 3 Back to Bella. It is one of my favorite books. I was really sad when the book ended. I read it many times and bought it so I could have my  own copy instead of borrowing from the library.
B005AUWXZ0|1.0|I had to see this film with the camp that I work for, and it was the worst part of working there. Let it be known that I never saw the first Cars because it never really appealed to me, but Pixar has never let me down before so I went into Cars 2 with an open mind. Unfortunately I was let down by this film.     To me, the film was boring, felt too long, the main character(Mator) was terrible, and did not have a topic that the children (most likely Pixar's target audience) would not relate to in any way. I can understand how Mator may have been a good supporting character in the first film, but the whole dumb, airhead character is never a good main character. The film being about cars and their oil is not something that children would know anything about. The group of kids I was with did not really understand what was going on with the whole changing of oil plot and even though I understood the plot, it is not something that I would want to sit and watch a movie on.     To be honest, after seeing this film I have no interest in ever seeing the first film or watching this one again. This series may be financially successful for Pixar, but one thing that I always loved about Pixar is that even though they produce animated children's film, their films can be enjoyed by all. It seems as though they put so much work into their films to create some of the best animated films around that everyone can enjoy. Pixar has disappointed me with Cars 2. Cars 2 is without a doubt the worst Pixar film I have ever seen, and it seems as though the critics agree with that. I would not suggest Cars 2 to anyone, whether it be someone my age, a chid, or anyone else for that matter.    One last note, the short film before Cars 2 was excellent and better than anything seen in the main feature.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this keyboard app!! I also had the beta and did not want to pay for the use updated since I got the original one for free before. Since SwiftKey said they were working to get it back on Amazon I figured I could wait. This keyboard really learns from u and is great at predicting what u are going to say. U barely have to type anything. I like the fact that it comes in different themes. I had Swype before it would always stop working after a while  I would have to uninstall and install again. I have had this for a while and have yet to have any problems!
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|This movie was awesome! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Liam Neeson, and anyone who loved Taken.There were twists and turns throughout the movie. Confused at parts, but once you figured it out, it was unbelievable! Incredible ending... did not see it coming.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|I bought the movie when it was released on standard definition. The documentary in this set is the same. If you didn't buy it before, buy it now. However, realize when it comes out in 3D you will have to pay again to keep up with technology.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Don't over analyze and accept this movie for what it is.  It's not trying to be an Academy Award winner.  It's just an entertaining sci-fi at it's best with great special effects and cool story line.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|My granddaughter whose 15 told me about LOST. I was working swing when LOST was on TV and also I thought it was one of those survive reality shows. I was watching an episode with granddaughter and got hooked. I didn't want to wait on Netflix and I tried Netflix streaming too slow for my computer. I looked on Amazon & there was LOST for a great price even though it was an used Complete Lost series. I was not disappointed, in fact I am amazed at how fast the seller got the product to me. Much appreciated and so much fun. Now grandkids and I are playing the LOST game.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I have heard all the hype about lady gaga to the point where i just had to sit down and listen to this body of work all the way through, with the knowledge that EVERYONE is saying she's a phenomenal talent. well... being the lover of pop music that i am, i gave it a try. i was VERY disappointed, i heard NOTHING on this record that would deem this artist phenomenal. good-Gothic-techno pop, nothing else. nothing truly special or memorable. she is a product of genius marketing, not genius music. without all the weird outfits and crazy antics gaga's music ranks with every other good pop artist. but nothing above that. SERIOUSLY...what is everyone hearing that is so amazing, give any pop star of today Gothic techno beats and weird hair and you've got  lady gaga.
0553801473|1.0|What can i say?<br />The story does not move at all. Infact the story may have moved backward.<br />Nothing happend and it was like reading a science book. Alteast even in a science book you do run into something here and there<br /><br />Some of the characters were no longer the characters who were. Tyrion and everything.<br />nothing happens except that i trudged through the papers<br /><br />Editors please
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was amazing, engaging and impossible to put down.  I stayed up all night to finish this one.  It's that good.  The romance between Abby and Travis is not your typical boy meets girl, fall in love and it's roses and sunshine.  If that is the type of romance book you want, this is not for you.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is a strong-willed girl with a horrible past who leaves Witchita to attend college with her best friend, America, so she can have a different life.  Travis Maddox is the ultimate tatooed, strong and sexy bad boy. Unfortunately, he is a womanizing user known for breaking girls hearts and famous for his one-night stands and never losing a fight.  He is introduced to Abby by America and her boyfriend Shepley (Travis' counsin).  Instantly, he is intrigued by her disinterest in him and her overall aloofness.  Abby is attracted to Travis, but knows he is bad news.  Eventually Abby and Travis become great friends who eventually become something more but not without a lot of work and convincing from Travis.<br /><br />I loved this story.  I loved how Abby did not fall all over Travis and remained true to herself and wanted what was best for her despite how she felt about him.  I loved how Travis became a better man to earn her love for him.  It is a long tough road for them and they are a disaster.  This book is a beautifully written love story.  I will look for more from this author.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Haunting and inspiring at the same time. At first I wasnt sure if I wanted to read the book but once I started I couldnt stop. She has such a positive and uplifting spirit for all that she has been through. Be prepared because some parts are very hard to read.
0140135154|4.0|The content of this book is fantastic. The essays give insight into photography in a way that I had never thought of before and the photographic essays give context and background for those essays. Any fan of art, philosophy, or just pretty pictures should pick up a copy. The only negative thing I have to say is that this book was formatted HORRIBLY. It looks as if it was made in Microsoft Word. The font is ugly and bolded, the margins don't seem consistent, and the pictures look as if they were copy and pasted in and pushed around to make an unattractive collage.
1451629184|5.0|A Stolen Life is a memoir about horrific, appalling, unspeakable, revolting, terrifying, evil acts.  Truly, the stuff of nightmares.  It is also an account of restitution and healing for a young woman and her daughters.    I read B. Boyle's review on here and agree that the enablers were woven into the insanity and abuse the entire time.  I felt what made me keep reading was the constant questions that came to my mind, like:  What was his mother doing?  Did he abuse her also?  What did his co-workers think about him?  What if this had happened to my child?  What if this had happened to me?  How did Jaycee keep her sense of self?  How could such a young child have the courage to face the constant, daily fear of harm or death in the beginning?  How can she not point fingers of anger and resentment toward the numerous police and other officers who came to the home and did not find her?  How did she stay healthy in that environment?  How did she protect her children?    Jaycee's inner strength and resilience are hard to believe.  To go along with her captor and obey him, yet still have the boldness to get out when she finally could is like a prisoner of war being released.  The story is almost too far from my reality to comprehend, yet it was and is HER reality.      Her JAYC Foundation must be a passionate part of her healing process, and a way to give back and move on with her life in a very meaningful way.  I would definitely recommend a parent read this book first to decide if their child should read it.
B000BNI99K|5.0|This a great set.  Less expensive than buying each CD by itself and a interesting book too!  Would make a great gift too!
0307716511|2.0|'Sister' received high accolades, and I love a good, literary mystery, so I was quite looking forward to reading this.  Unfortunately, as the story moved forward I found the narrative dull, and the mystery, as it unraveled, read as familiar. Overtly so -- by the time I finished, I was irritated.  The mystery laid out here has been done a thousand times over, and Sister added nothing new to it. There isn't anything terribly special about the prose, and with the mystery being old hat, the novel gets terribly boring during the big reveal/final thirty pages of the book. It's difficult to critically analyze the book without spoiling it for others, but I wanted to warn you: proceed with caution, and don't believe the hype. I wouldn't recommend this book. Put simply: I didn't like it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Gripping story. The characters were brought to life through the impressive writing. I would love to see her next novel soon!
0525423842|5.0|The book arrived on time & in excellent condition. I started it this morning & read half of it before I decided I better get up & do something!
B002ZG99NG|5.0|I've lived in the Boston area for years and this movie kind of hit me in many ways.  Sure I've been to Charlestown, twice.  The characters seemed believable, the dialect was perfect, it what was I hear every time I go downtown.<br /><br />The movie had lots of action and the acting was believable, the characters all seemed to be more than just placeholders.  All in all, totally worth buying and watching again and again.  All the elements were believable and moving, great movie.
0811729117|5.0|Excellent read, an important part of the struggle on the Eastern Front.  Carius gives good account of the daily difficulties along with the many   small victories to stem the tide of the Red Terror.
0307272702|5.0|I saw this author on the Dr. Oz show and was very interested in his Atkins-like concepts. I borrowed a couple of his older books from the library, but this new book was not available. So, of course, I ordered it from Amazon! I find myself referring to this book often. I prefer the simple diet guidelines in the back of the book rather than the limiting menus that some diet books have. These guidelines have helped me lose 10 pounds with little effort and no hunger.
0670022411|3.0|I loved the premise of this novel - an ancient manuscript, a reluctant witch and an intriguing vampire - sounds like a great brew!  Unfortunately, the author's cauldron got a little too crowded with extra characters and prolonged plot lines that seemed designed simply to extend the story to a trilogy, rather than making the book more robust.  Shades of Diana Gabaldon and Stephanie Meyer echo throughout, but both authors have more success than Harkness.  Despite my disappointment, I will read the sequel, and recommend it for a \\"fun\\" read, especially to those who may be new to this genre and unlikely to see it as a repeat of other authors.
B004GYOQ6A|1.0|I cannot rate how well this app works or even if I like it because this game will not download on my Droid version 2.2.2.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|WOW! I had no idea how much I would love and devour this book. I read it in 2 days, could not put it down. The story is non stop action. I wasn't sure I would like a story that centered around children who are supposed to kill each other to survive but the author did it in such a good way. I can't wait to read the next one, I'm on a wait list to borrow that says it will take a day and I'm not sure I can even wait that long! You will not regret reading this book.
0767903862|3.0|Bryson's later books (At Home and A Short History of Nearly Everything)led me to read Sunburned Country but I found it lacked the cohesiveness of his later works.  The facts presented, as ever, are fascinating.  It is certainly worth a read for learning offbeat aspects about Australia.
B002TXB2TE|1.0|This is a wonderful movie.  I first saw it on cable,and thought this is a definite candidate for blu-ray.  Imagine the music uncompressed. I was ready, excited to watch and listen as I fired up the blu-ray player.  only to be disappointed to read the message on the screen, \\"this is a region B disc and will not play on this player\\".  This vendor must think California is in Europe.  I imagine return postage to be prohibitive to returning.  I may follow up after contacting the vendor, Moviemars.
B0050VI5SI|5.0|I have really enjoyed listening to this - everything about it, the lyrics, the melodies, the vocals are extremely catching.  Nice job, guys. keep up the good work.
0553801473|4.0|Dance has all of the qualities you'd expect from the previous four novels. I deducted 1 star for two minor complaints:<br />- I wanted overarching plots to be advanced further.<br />- Some parts are slow and boring at times, especially the travel chapters in Essos. Inclusion of these throwaway character development scenes made lack of plot advancement more frustrating.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good continuation of the series, but I expected a little more.
0345529057|5.0|First of all the person writing this review is a woman, not Gary (account is under hubby's name) So this is from a woman's perspective. Don't let the Fantasy genre push you away from reading this series.  It is not your typical \\"guy\\" fantasy series. The women in this book are not objectified & are strong women of courage & strength - now onto my thoughts...  This series of books is like paper \\"crack\\".  I cannot get enough of reading them.  Just started book 5 am reading slowly because I don't want it to end.  If I'm not reading it, I'm thinking about it and if I'm asleep...I'm dreaming about it!!  I know it sounds CRAZY OBSESSIVE, but I can't help myself - it is what it is!! The characters are so interesting and written with such thought & human complexities.  LOVE THESE BOOKS!!
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|Although my review is short, It will be very clear.  Having heard of this story, and debated the fee for renting: wondering in my mind, how could a film really portray the emotions he must have felt? Let alone extend the incident into a full feature.  I was pleasantly surprised at the texture, and color of this piece of film.   I would recommend this to anyone having heard of, or not heard the story prior.  Rarely do films evoke my emotions, (not to say I'm callous, just overly scrutinizing a movie is how I take part in a film) but this flick had me on toes and seats edge.  The graphic nature of the scenes were but a minor contributor to the effects on my emotions; but the portrayal of the maze in Aron's mind when faced with a narrow path to survive really sent chills through my spine.  The focus of the lens seemed to acute on all the points needed to raise the bar for the film, not limiting it to some cliche 'true story'.  What a wonderful piece of not only cinema and acting; but of the ingenuity, strength, and monumental nature of the human spirit.  Hats of to Aron, and all whom were involved in this project.  Defiantly deserved the awards it received.  Thanks Amazon!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This finale to the Harry Potter story has everything you want in a movie(ACTION, DRAMA, COMEDY, and even ROMANCE!) It is a great movie to watch with your friends, your family, or even by yourself. They gave it great graphics just like the rest of them, but this film has one thing the rest of them don't. It has the intensity of Voldemort throughout the entire film. You finally get to see Harry show his true strength by going at it with Voldemort and all of his minions. They bring out many things in the castle that you have not seen in any other one of the films. In this film you find out who the true bad guys are and who the true good guys are. Of course you would know all of this if you read the books, but it is very different seeing it on screen.<br />A must see, must own!
B004WKOCP8|2.0|It's a short and simple review. This album really lacks anything memorable. It's just bland and boring. There's nothing that hooks you and drags you in. It's just, not good.  Take any other Incubus CD over this one. If Not Now, When? can be completely avoided, it's just simply not worth it.
1591840562|5.0|This is a fun, clear, simple book about entrepreneurial drive and focus. I found it to be practical and helpful when I was first contemplating starting my own company. Some of the advice may seem overly simplistic, but even the basics about creating slides in large fonts with few words are surprisingly valuable.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Every element of this film, from the concept to the script to the execution, is PHENOMENAL. The acting is top-notch, and the director excelled at creating striking visuals and a creepy tone. All these aspects keep the audience on edge as we accompany Natalie Portman's character on her downward spiral into madness.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|This is great concert whether you are a TALKING HEADS fan or not. The concert is directed by Jonathan Demme and has nice patient long takes (instead of constant flashes and cuts like most concerts) and has a simple but beautiful stage lighting set-up. The picture and audio quality is superb (the Stereo mix is the best) and preserves the original film grain on the BLU RAY which is nice. Great commentary tracks as well. My only criticism is that the sound is out of sync on some of the songs by a bit because they appear to be be cutting in sound from many concerts into one.
B00518HBD0|2.0|At first listen the second the opening song \\"Time of My Life\\" came in I was very intrigued on what the album was going to be.  The song has so much energy and is a great rocking opener.  It puzzles me as to why this song was not released as the first single for that matter.  I think the reason for that was so that it would not mislead people to believe that the album was going to have songs with the similar energy.  Instead, they chose to release the \\"When I'm Gone\\" sound-alike \\"When You're Young\\".  The song literally sounds exactly like the former hit only with different lyrics.  It's no wonder the song isn't being played on radio stations as much as the former comparable hit.  Also, take a listen to the song \\"Heaven\\" and then go listen to their hit \\"Here Without You\\".  Now tell me there aren't any similarities...  This album not only has songs that sound like previous ones they've crafted before but it is also inconsistent.  It goes along with the Nickelback trend of releasing an album with half rockers and half made for radio ballads.  I enjoy ballads a lot but when an album is overloaded with ballads that sound similar to one another then it becomes not so appealing to listen to.  Also, when I mean inconsistent I'm saying that every other song is a ballad.  It goes from rocker to ballad to rocker to ballad etc...  This trend seriously makes an album sound all over the place.  Besides the fantastic opener, the only other track on here that brings on that energy is the charging closer \\"Believer\\".  What a way to end an album but it's a shame not many of the other tracks have the same appeal as the opener and closer.  If I had to pick another quality track from this album it would be \\"My Way\\".  It's got a pretty catchy chorus with some good riffs.  Other than that you're not getting much else but just more of the same.  I think it's time for them to experiment just a little bit.  Not only that but whatever happened to songs like the strong single \\"Loser\\" where the song is midtempo but comes in with an uptempo rockin bridge?  Showing variety in their song structures than the typical verse, chorus, verse, would be a nice change.  In concluding to my review, if you want a good 3 Doors Down album stick to their first two or three records.  However, on the plus side I highly recommend you check out the tracks \\"Time Of My Life\\", \\"Believer\\", and I'll throw in \\"My Way\\".
B00386EZJU|5.0|I can't say anything that hasn't already been written, but this soundtrack is one of the most captivating, inspiring, thrilling, and simply awesome albums I have ever heard. I listen to it everyday, I've never grown tired of it, and I've always been sad when I have to stop. John Powell is a genius for making this soundtrack and I can't wait to hear more!
0553801473|2.0|Like most fans of George R.R. Martin, I was eagerly anticipating this book and was overjoyed when the mail man finally dropped by with a gorgeous looking hard cover volume from amazon. I actually took a day off on the estimated delivery date so that I could spend the entire day reading, that's how much I was looking forward to this.<br /><br />I was expecting a feast, but sadly I was left hungry. A Dance with Dragons is similar in its pace to its predecessor A Feast for Crows, and any fans expecting much in the way of plot resolution or story progession will be sorely disappointed. Things do start moving along a little towards the end of the book, but it is nothing that did any more than making me frustrated and wet my appetite even more for the next book.<br /><br />It's not all negative though. Even if I was hoping for something more, it was still nice to be reacquainted Danaerys, Jon, and Tyrion. In this book GRRM also does a good job with fleshing out the world beyond Westeros a bit more, and learning more about exotic locales such as Volantis and Slaver's Bay was something I enjoyed. For this reason I give A Dance with Dragons 2 stars instead of 1. This may seem harsh, but George R.R. Martin is one of the most prolific fantasy writers of our time and deserves nothing less than being held to lofty standards.<br /><br />In spite of this not living up to expectations, I can't imagine anyone who has read and enjoyed the 4 first books in the series not wanting to pick this up. Don't expect too much of it though, and like me just hope that the next one will be better. Winter is coming and it can't come soon enough!
0307595862|3.0|I loved The Redbreast and have read Nesbo's other books that have been translated into English.  The snowman is just a little too fantastic and unbelievable for my tastes.  With almost all of the Harry Hole books you have to be able to swallow a lot of coincidence and this one was almost too much. I feel like Nesbo is going in the direction of gory titillation more and more with each subsequent book.  That being said, it is a fun read and will keep you guessing until the end. I suspect some things are \\"lost in translation\\" as well; all in all,  Nesbo still tops most American crime fiction authors.
B004PEJ1H0|5.0|Awesome and Different...A superb cover of a great song.  But unlike so many covers, this is truly a 180 from the original.  The original is a tremendous song and so is this one.  You probably have to listen to it more than once to get it because he uses a sound effect (not auto-tune, although it sounds similar) but it fits perfectly for a song about drug addiction from a great singer who has his own problems with drug addiction.  As a fellow sufferer of addictions I appreciate the song and the effort.
B00544L9EI|4.0|A great comeback album! Royce and Em really shine on this CD. Their chemistry is undeniable, as they finish eachother's sentences and rhyme flows. Some songs aren't that great *cough* Lighters *cough*, but everything else is pretty consistent. Em's 2011 style is something I can get used to!

B00499LTLM|5.0|Holmes is always good as a period man, provided you like and endless diet of Victorian England.     I enjoyed the Robert Downey version, but honestly, bringing him up to date just meant a llt of explosions, at ion chase scenes somehow completely unrealistic.    This serves well. The Sherlock of Conan Doyle was a man ahead of his time. So is this Sherlock. HIs man Watson is a lost soul with the commonality with the original of Afghanistan, but they're in contemporary London and it all fits beautifully together. The stories still have their chrgm, but the actors are simply superb. And it's amazing how much of the original thematic concepts fit modern life in London. And, for what it's worth, this has found new Holmes popularity in Britain,  a pair of sex symbols for the modern Brit.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|The premise of this film was 5+ stars.<br />A great idea.<br />But it fell apart in the execution.<br /><br />At the risk of spoiling too much of the movie, I will only point out one odd thing that really struck me.<br />If a group of beings has the ability to manipulate and steer the futures of humans and use \\"portal doors\\" to get around, it would seem they would be advanced enough to not have to run around to chase people.<br /><br />I was excited when we heard about this film and LOVED the idea of the plot ... but it just didn't come together for some reason.<br /><br />This is an example of a film that would be a good candidate for a remake in 10 years or so --- and hope they can do more with it then.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Perhaps this is the best place to review the series as well as the last installment. We have seen Daniel Radcliffe mature from a fairy bad actor to one that is fairly convincing, particularly in his standing up to Aberforth Dumbledore. Emma Watson has gone from awkward kid who wore her emotions on her sleeve to Maxim's top 100 Hottest women. The passing of Richard Harris was a major let down to the series as Michael Gambon couldn't really fill his shoes. The most interesting and complex character was that of Snape. Alan Rickman made the series with his portrayal. The casting of the quirky minor characters made the story most enjoyable, all the way down to Mrs. Fink. Rowling's use of classical mythology, astronomy and the occult made the series an incredible educational experience. One of my favorite characters was the under used Luna Lovegood. She was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The direction of Chris Columbus was by far the best as well as the screen adaptations, which more closely followed the books. Starting with the third installment, the audience got short changed (There, I said it) especially those who didn't read the books...such as myself. This wasn't a bad thing as it led to a bonding with my niece who did read the books and I would take her to the films so she could explain them to me. Like Hermione, she is one of those \\"insufferable know-it-alls\\" who loves to let you know what she knows. (Good luck with that brain surgeon thing.)<br /><br />In this final episode, the gang of 3 go after the remaining Horcrux(s) which are now easier to locate than in the last 2 films. This one follows the later films in that it lacks the humor of the earlier ones.<br /><br />The movie, like the series drives home the ideas of teamwork, friendship, and courage. Goblins, spiders, troll, elves, death eaters, a dragon, and of course he who we do not speak. Personally, I would have done the ending differently, especially with Snape and Malfoy. But I don't want to discuss any possible plot spoilers.

0938045695|4.0|Okay I know Pavel has some very rabid fans and detractors out there.  He seems to polarize people right off into either camp, so with that in mind I will try to be as unbiased as possible.  Enter the Kettlebell is a great book mainly for beginners.  The book itself is well made with quality paper and good illustrations.  Some consideration went into the design of it, and personally that's a big plus in my book (no pun intended).  Color photos, glossy heavy-duty pages, and good sized print makes it very easy on the eyes.  Zero complaints on the physical properties.<br /><br />As for the content well this I think is where people can start having their differences.  Pavel pulls no punches.  He loves kettlebells, and makes no bones about them being *the* way to train for strength, and all but says its the manly way to build functional strength.  I personally like that spin - it makes you feel part of something and gets you excited to go lift.  Problem is sometimes its laid on a bit too thick, and he sometimes turns it into a sales pitch for other products. (this is why it does not get five stars)<br /><br />The program and exercises themselves are top-notch with a lot of detail to explaining them and showing how to not do them.  This is something people have complained about - that he wastes too much time showing silly pictures of doing it wrong.  I know that many of us knows to not do some of this stuff but I think its great he's trying to cover the bases.  Too many fitness books just show pictures of how it's done right.  In any event I would still recommend seeing some videos of how the exercises are performed.  It is a great book, and if you are new to lifting kettlebells, or just want to see how Pavel and his followers do it is worth the investment.

B001GH1ZQE|5.0|I am extremely saddened by the untimely death of Amy Winehouse; she had so much more to give! Back To Black by Amy Winehouse features her talents as a professional singer, songwriter and guitar player. She even provides her own background vocals on some of these tracks! I'm impressed. Amy had her personal demons; but she does an incredible job performing the songs on this CD. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is beautifully done. The liner notes include the song lyrics as well as the credits.<br /><br />The album begins with Amy singing her heart out on \\"Rehab.\\" She sings of a woman, probably based in part on her own experiences, who is not exactly eager to go to a rehabilitation center as a way to get better. The musical arrangement has a strong percussion element that supplies the foundation for the music; the guitar and brass work well for \\"Rehab\\" to create a lush musical arrangement. Nevertheless, this arrangement never steals the spotlight away from Amy's vocals; and \\"Rehab\\" is a powerful, catchy and memorable number. \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" starts off with what sounds like a rap or hip hop musical intro; but when the music goes into the main portion of the song you get that `60s style arrangement Amy does so well. Amy sings this without a superfluous note and she never falters. \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" explores complicated, painful love relationships and Amy delivers this like a champ! In addition, I really like \\"Just Friends;\\" Amy sings this wearing her heart on her sleeve. Her excellent diction enhances her performance even more and again the music fits in perfectly with her singing.<br /><br />\\"Back To Black,\\" the title track for this album, reminds me of a tune The Supremes might have released in their time. Amy delivers this without a hitch and that's grand. \\"Back To Black\\" deals with the pain that can come with the ending of a love affair; and \\"Back To Black\\" is obviously a major highlight of this album. \\"Love Is a Losing Game\\" is another tune that explores the painful end of a love affair. \\"Love Is a Losing Game\\" also has a somewhat mellow, old school vibe arrangement to accompany Amy as she sings this to perfection and beyond! \\"Wake Up Alone\\" has complex key modulations but Amy handles this like the pro she is and always will be! \\"Wake Up Alone\\" stuns me with its beauty even though it's not the happiest of songs; Amy Winehouse does a great job on \\"Wake Up Alone.\\"<br /><br />\\"Some Unholy War\\" has Amy singing, playing guitar and providing her own backup vocals. \\"Some Unholy War\\" has Amy squarely in the spotlight--right where she belongs! Although the track set appears to end with \\"He Can Only Hold Her,\\" the CD has silence for about 20 seconds before we are treated to a remix of \\"You Know I'm No Good.\\" Excellent!<br /><br />Review update: There is a two CD \\"Deluxe\\" edition of Back to Black; here is the track listing according to Amazon's British website:<br /><br />CD 1<br />1. Rehab<br />2. You Know I'm No Good<br />3. Me And Mr. Jones<br />4. Just Friends<br />5. Back To Black<br />6. Love Is A Losing Game<br />7. Tears Dry On Their Own<br />8. Wake Up Alone<br />9. Some Unholy War<br />10. He Can Only Hold Her<br />11. Addicted (an extra track for the first CD)<br /><br />CD 2<br />1. Valerie<br />2. Cupid<br />3. Monkey Man<br />4. Some Unholy War (Down Tempo)<br />5. Hey Little Rich Girl<br />6. You're Wondering Now<br />7. To Know Him Is To Love Him<br />8. Love Is A Losing Game (Original Demo)<br /><br />\\"Addicted\\" is a very good tune; Amy sings her heart out! \\"Valerie\\" showcases Amy's excellent diction and the musical accompaniment fits in perfectly with her singing--I love it. \\"Cupid\\" features just how well Amy could interpret a lyric with a reggae style that just can't sound any better--and I'm very impressed. In fact, Amy's rendition of \\"Cupid\\" sounds even better than the original; and that's grand. \\"Monkey Man\\" is another fine song; and listen for Amy to do a great job on \\"Some Unholy War;\\" she really pours her soul into ballads like this one! \\"Hey Little Rich Girl\\" just plain sounds good; and \\"You're Wondering Now\\" is absolutely brilliant. \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him\\" is very well done; and the second CD closes with a demo of \\"Love Is a Losing Game\\" which leaves me wanting more!<br /><br />Back To Black still sells well years after its release; this proves just how wonderful the music is on this album. This CD and especially the two CD set is a \\"must-have\\" for Amy's fans; and people just discovering Amy would do well to start with this album. In addition, people who enjoy songs with a retro soul, R&B and even reggae flavor to them will not be disappointed.Wondering Now\\" is absolutely brilliant. \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him\\" is very well done; and the second CD closes with a demo of \\"Love Is a Losing Game\\" which leaves me wanting more!

B003Y5H59W|5.0|A good bit of this film is a superhero-origins story, in which we follow Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a plain-featured young man of about 20 years old who is a classic \\"90-pound weakling,\\" as he tries five times to enlist in the Army during the early part of World War II. He is consistently rated as \\"4F\\" because of his size and various health issues, including asthma. Inside that small, frail body, however, resides outsized courage, honor, loyalty and persistence. During Steve's fifth trip to the Army recruiters, those virtues in Steve draw the attention of Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), a German scientist who escaped the Nazis and is working on a top-secret program to develop super soldiers. Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), who is in charge of the program, wants to use a soldier who is bigger, stronger and has more training for the first human experiment with the Dr. Erskine's super-soldier formula, but the doctor strongly disagrees. He says the other soldier is a bully, but Steve is a good man. It is crucial that anyone receiving the formula be of good character, because the formula enhances the existing personality traits of whoever receives it. Steve would become even more of a good person, but a bully could become a villain.<br /><br />The experiment is a success, but immediately after Steve is transformed into a handsome, ripped, perfect specimen of manhood, a Nazi spy assassinates Dr. Erskine and steals the formula. Though Steve manages to stop the assassin from escaping, in his first act of heroism as a newly minted superhero, the flask breaks in the process. Without a sample of the formula, it cannot be replicated because the doctor never wrote down the whole formula. Steve is now one of a kind. Unfortunately, the military can't think of anything to do with him other than turn him into a US-flag-wrapped peddler of war bonds appearing in USO shows with chorus girls, until Steve is sent abroad. He finds himself entertaining the recently decimated troops of Col. Phillips and is horrified to discover that his best friend James Buchanan \\"Bucky\\" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has been captured with 400 other Allied soldiers and is being held prisoner in a massively defended fortress deep in enemy lines. Col. Phillips insists he would lose far more men than he could save going after his captured men, and refuses to do anything. But the colonel's assistant, a female military officer, Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), encourages Steve to fulfill his destiny as the super-soldier Dr. Erskine created him to be by staging a one-man rescue raid.<br /><br />On every level this film is outstanding. It is directed by the talented Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park III, [[ASIN:B000031EGV Jumanji]] ). The screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the writing team best known for the three [[ASIN:B000E8M0VA Chronicles of Narnia]] films) is an excellent adaptation, staying true in every important way to the world of a comic-book icon with a 70-year history of stories in Marvel Comics since the Captain's first appearance in 1941.<br /><br />All of the actors are terrific, but the star, Chris Evans (who played the comic-book superhero, Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, in the two [[ASIN:B00005JNTU Fantastic Four]] films), is superb. Evans gives a depth and breadth to his performance that is remarkable for any genre, but especially for a superhero film. In his capable hands, Steve is endearingly humble, yet enduringly determined to have a chance to contribute to the worldwide struggle against the Nazis in the beginning, origins part of the film. And after the transformation, he compellingly presents Steve as a fascinating contradiction of a relentless, manly warrior who is still emotionally innocent and naïve.<br /><br />Steve's relationship with Peggy, as his romantic interest in the film, has significant barriers to their connection that makes it both amusing and exciting to watch. She is his superior officer and, for a young man who has barely even had a conversation with a woman before her, it takes more bravery than going to war for him to aspire to a relationship with a woman like Peggy. She is not only gorgeous, but a formidable warrior in her own right. What I found as intriguing as the romantic potential between these two, however, is the fact that they bring out the best in each other. Peggy gives Steve the inspiration to seize his destiny as a super-warrior when the colonel and other leaders have ordered him to sit out the war, and Steve's innate sensitivity and goodness soften the shell of cynicism Peggy has developed around her heart in the harsh, man's world of the Army.<br /><br />The incredibly versatile Stanley Tucci ([[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada]], The Lovely Bones) is terrific as Dr. Erskine. Hugo Weaving (who played V in [[ASIN:B000FS9FCG V for Vendetta]] and Agent Smith in [[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]] movies) is his usual brilliant self as the villain Red Skull. Anytime he appears in anything it is a gift, but he is particularly skilled as a comic-book super villain. As for Tommy Lee Jones, he was simply made for the part of Colonel Chester Phillips. Sebastian Stan (Carter Baizen on [[ASIN:B000W6ZUUC Gossip Girl]]) is a convincing choice as Bucky. He and Chris Evans have excellent buddy chemistry as best friends since childhood. All of the other supporting actors are great, too, including Neal McDonough ([[ASIN:B0000ACOXL Traitor]]) as Timothy 'Dum Dum' Dugan, Derek Luke ([[ASIN:B00005JLRZ Antwone Fisher]]) as Gabe Jones, Kenneth Choi ([[ASIN:B001BP4K22 Street Kings]]) as Jim Morita, and JJ Feild (Northanger Abbey) as James Montgomery Falsworth.<br /><br />Finally, the special effects in the action scenes, aided by computer-generated imagery (CGI), are absolutely breathtaking, making this movie a must-see on the big screen. There is also one other CGI effect that I found awe-inspiring. The real, buffed Chris Evans is trimmed down via CGI to the pre-formula Steve.  \\"It's pretty amazing,\\" Evans told Reuters. \\"They took shape out of my jaw line, they shrunk my skeleton, and they made my shoulders less broad.\\"  They certainly did. The skinny Steve has the body of a prepubescent boy. As for the actual physique of Chris Evans--he went through a specialized training program to put on 15 pounds of muscle on a physique that was already quite ripped.<br /><br />Among the multiple feature films already done on the Captain, this should delight fans as a standout contribution.rsation with a woman before her, it takes more bravery than going to war for him to aspire to a relationship with a woman like Peggy.

0553801473|2.0|After a very long wait for this book, I can honestly say that I was sadly...not so thrilled. It's true as to what the other reviewers say that this book goes on and on and on about the description of food, the long travels by ship and so on and so on and so on. You would think after reading this book I'd have learn to articulate my thought process but the ending and the lack of progress with the plot line has left befuddled and left wanting and wondering. Word of warning, do not get too attached to any character (main or not) as it'll only disappoint you in the end. Especially when the first 3 or 4 books gave you hints that they may have been the hero (if I can use such a word)and will continue to the very end of this series. But then the author is lord, king and god and may do as he wish regardless of what the common fan may say. All in all, it is well written, but the our generation's Tolkien? I think not.

B0034G4P7G|1.0|I'm truly amazed at all the gushingly positive hype for this film. (Of course, I'm even more amazed at all the gushingly positive hype for Facebook). Regardless, this movie is slow to develop and centered around an entire cast of characters that are completely unlikable. Half way through the film, my only thought was, \\"Who cares?\\". A bunch of dysfunctional, self-embroiled kids put up a soulless website that attracts another bunch of dysfunctional, self-embroiled kids and then otherwise intelligent adults value the whole nebulous thing at an astonishing 25 billion! Did we learn nothing from the internet bubble? Anyway, if you're looking for an exciting, well-paced, thought-provoking movie, this is definitely not it.
B000002KXV|5.0|Back in college, a Student Services employee cranked up this CD one day and I was immediately hooked.  After that I chilled to \\"The Nightfly\\" every Saturday while running the campus computer lab.  It's one of those rare albums where I like all of the songs, and one of the rarer ones that never gets dull because of its cool, jazzy, and upbeat sound.<br /><br />Donald Fagen writes in the liner notes that \\"the songs on this album represent certain fantasies that might have been entertained by a young man growing up in the remote suburbs of a northeastern city during the late fifties and early sixties, i.e., one of my general height, weight and build.\\"  That's \\"The Nightfly\\" in a nutshell, as youthful dreams tend to be on the lighter, more hopeful side.<br /><br />Although I'm of a later generation, I've always admired the clean-cut, high-tech lines of the space-age era and the optimistic, can-do spirit of those times, even when tempered by the Cold War and simmering social issues.  The songs reflect my resulting idealized images, from the utopian world of \\"I.G.Y\\" to the jaded late-night DJ of the title track (I'm a night owl as well as a geek).<br /><br />Many years after graduation I'm still working the lone-wolf Saturday shift as a hospital IT Specialist, and \\"The Nightfly\\" never fails to keep me company - although nowadays on an iPod dock that would have been considered pretty sci-fi during Mr. Fagen's youth.  Kind of fitting, I suppose.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|This is probably the worst film I watched in years. There's no plot, story, or drama, but it's not lack of mindless shouting and shooting from start to end. From the very beginning you watch those soldiers talking, shouting, running around, and shooting without a target or enemy until 30 minutes later alien robots showed up one after another for a street fight. When you just got excited and thought that the battle finally got started, you are into a rude awakening after the next 100 minutes - the street fight between a dozen LA soliders and invading alien robots is all there is for the Battle: LA - nothing else beyond that, period!<br /><br />Besides the messy dialogues and characters, camera and editing of this film is both unbearable and embarrassing. Most shots in the film are close ups and cuts from one scene to another or from one face close up to another with each shot/scene lasting less than 1 or 2 seconds. If that doesn't make you dizzy after a whole hour cuts and close ups, the whole film seems to be shot on a shoulder held camera, constantly shaking and moving without ever a still or panoramic shot.<br /><br />The whole film is a total disaster - no climax, no originality, and no brain - any supposedly serious and solemn moments are so childishly made by cliche or a formula that you can't help laughing...<br /><br />I definitely vote this one as the \\"worst of the worst film\\" of the year! The one star goes to the film editor, who must have worked really hard to stitch this rag together into a 116 min. long film.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|What people forget to realize is that Theory of a Deadman was never a band meant to blow you away with some kind of sound you've never heard from music, since the very beginning they've always been a solid radio-friendly band and I see nothing different with this album then their previous albums.  This album stays true to who Theory of a Deadman is and I am very happy with it.  If you are a true Theory of a deadman fan you will love this album as I do.

0553801473|5.0|As a preliminary note, I'll mention that I first read Game of Thrones in November 2010, and I've basically been reading the series non-stop ever since.  I finished a Feast for Crows the week before this new installment hit the shelves, and began reading a Dance with Dragons the moment my pre-order downloaded to my Kindle.<br /><br />With that being said and under this context, I found A Dance with Dragons to be nicely written and well within the spirit of A Song of Ice and Fire.  Additionally, I felt it perfectly supplemented the glaring character gaps that so many complained of in A Feast for Crows - in fact, I was able to better appreciate A Fest for Crows after reading A Dance with Dragons.  Not only does Martin continue to weave a masterful and complex tale of incomprehensible size, but he also expands the saga far beyond the confines of Westeros.  Importantly, the novel maintains a commitment to adventure, danger, sex, and political intrigue - elements that made the previous novel so enthralling.<br /><br />I can't understand the amount of negative comments about this book.  Many complain that the story will never end - or that the book is too convoluted and boring.  I highly disagree with this sentiment.  I found it just as exciting as the previous novels, including a Storm of Swords, and find the complexity a strength that makes it more intellectually stimulating than traditional fantasy.  Finally, who can honestly say they want this series to just come to an end?  That would be like going to Six Flags or Disney World and anticipating the moment you can go home.  I can't relate to that perspective, and am thankful that the story lives on.
B005DD7H50|3.0|I found this movie to be somewhat entertaining, but certainly not spectacular.  Of course, Bradley Cooper can make any movie entertaining just because he is gorgeous, but there were several things that were just so absurd, that it took the movie out of the awesome category and put it into the entertaining category; specifically the outcome of a police lineup, too many clumsy fingers, and a really absurd blood drinking incident.    There were some nice twists in the movie, and I enjoyed those, and the ending was good, so it wasn't a total waste.  It just wasn't great.
B001W79MBI|4.0|The art was great.The story was well written. I had to watch it twice to really understand who was fighting who and who was on what side. It seemed like there should have been a girl in this movie somewhere. Oh well. There may have been too much blood for my taste, but if you like that sort of thing, this one is for you. With all that being said, I really enjoyed this movie.
0061251321|2.0|Very disappointing... this book was very superficial and lacked substance.      I read this book based on hearing Ken Wilbur interview the one of the authors, Dave Logan.  Ken Wilbur seemed to like the book and concepts and he recommended it, so I thought it would be a really compelling read.  But it was not.  Not even close.  (Now, I will adjust my Ken Wilbur credibility gage)    I kept hoping it would go somewhere and get interesting, but chapter after chapter, it did not.      One thing this book does have, is a whole lot of name dropping - Michael Jordon, Mike Eruzione, Carol Burnett among others.  And in a truly bizarre twist, they have numerous quotes from Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, and from an actor in the movie, Office Space. They seem to suggest that these two, a cartoonist that finds humor in dysfunctional business behavior, and an actor that played great model of what they were discussing, somehow lends credibility to their thesis.  It came of as really weak.     There are way to many good/ great business & culture books out there to pick this one.  Also, if you are looking for leadership books, again, there are way to many great ones to pick this one.      And finally, if you want a reference point to which books I think are great: Good to Great by Jim Collins is a great business book.  And for leadership, you should read Endurance, by Alfred Lansing.     You have been warned!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I watched this movie until I couldn't watch it anymore! I made everyone in my family watch it and they loved it. The story line was very well written with complex elements which really layered the story. This is a movie that children and adults will enjoy all the same for different reasons. It's funny, witty and creative. I'm glad I have it in my collection!
009193768X|5.0|Warning:  contents may be excellent for your health.  Fortnum's T-book will not disappoint as it captures the quality and tone found in Piccadilly  It is a true delight in every sense of the word:  if you never set foot in a kitchen you would find the volume full of delicious and imaginatively creative morsels you would want to share with those nearest and dearest.  It is a great gift to one's self and to one's hostess who appreciates quality, the refined palate and life, the energy and dedication to maintain same, plain old tradition, and the value of a generous spirit.  It would be at home equally in the kitchen library or at a bedside where thoughts of sugarplums are real.  Do not resist.  Your heart will melt and your senses will be heightened.  There will always be Fortnum's.  Thanks be!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Bring out your inner ninja with this game app.  I am so addicted to this game.  The graphics are excellent, the game play is fast and entertaining, the fruit even has different sounds when sliced. There are three game modes:  Classic, Arcade, and Zen.  All are fun.  You can earn bonuses and unlock new swords and backgrounds.  Plus, you get cool fruit facts from Sensei! I wish this game was available of Wii.  That would be really awesome.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|Some powerful, catchy tunes with impeccable studio effects.  Definitely a top entertainer who continues to creatively  experiment. Tracks 10 and 14 rock.
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|The trailer seemed intriguing and I like Amanda Siegfried so I watched Red Riding Hood.  I was a bit apprehensive because of the bad reviews but it wasn't that bad.  The plot wasn't really extraordinary but the style the movie was shot was to me a project based on a vision because it was so stylized.  Sometimes it's too much that it takes away from the progression of the film.
1582701709|1.0|This book was total hype, nothing in it worth wild. Better off think just about what ya want, real hard, & save your money!
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|I thought this film would be more entertaining but actually it made me depressed. I don't know if that is the intent but although the movie has mildly funny segments, and even happy ones, like the dance sequence, it is overall sad because it is a story of unrequited love.  Summer was with Tom just for fun. Although she was up-front that she didn't want a relationship, the way she carried on with him seemed like she did, which was not fair.  She was very strange and hard to understand. She's quite nonchalant about hurting Tom.  At least the ending showed some promise of happiness for Tom because he was really treated like a door mat.
B004L79VUI|5.0|I have been a fan of the band since I heard rush release tapes of \\"Big Pink\\" while at a Sea Train concert at the Cafe Au Go Go (Greenwich Village, NYC) back in 1967...during an intermission between Sea Train and the opening act (?).  In fact, if I were pushed to answer the question: \\"if you were stranded on a desert island which album would you wish you had with you?\\" (assuming I had the electricity or some portable device with which to play it---scratch that...I would still want the album with me just to<br />hold onto)...well, the answer would be \\"The Last Waltz\\".  THE BAND is my all-time very favorite musical institution.  That brings us to RR's new release.  Let me say this: this work is the logical connection with Robbie's time with THE BAND.  This very well, could have been his first post-Band release...it should have been.  Here he gives closure to his time with the boys and fulfills the promise of \\"Broken Arrow\\".  Gone, at least here, are his esoteric forays into Native American Musics.  Instead he concerns himself with the meat and potatoes a true Band fan wants.  Ironically the two \\"throw aways\\" are the title song, oddly enough, and the self-indulgent, tangential \\"Tango For Django\\".  Robbie even goes confessional (a true fan knew immediately what he meant when he utters: \\"to walk out on the boys was never the plan\\" (I wonder if Levon believes this) in the song, \\"This Is Where I Get Off\\". Albeit, he makes the attempt to set things right.  The first five tunes hit hard and well.  I would have been satisfied with just those on an EP release.  And yet he manages to follow those up with more good songs up until the last two.  This is by far RR's best effort since, THE LAST WALTZ.  Vince DeLucia/aka Vince Lucie
1451629184|4.0|It's hard to read what she endured those days.It's touchy memoir.I burst into tears when I was reading some part of book.I was confused sometime when I was reading.I felt that she was content with her condition after 2-3 years of abduction. Actually, it's easy to be deceiving 11 years old girl. Also,she had no choice. Phillip Garrido had used some psychological technics for brain washing.One thing that never understood is there were lots of opportunites to catch him according to different sources.There were so many delinquencies.Also,is it possible to not being used strict surveillance technics for this kind of sick person.I'm not judging USA system.We should be much more careful for these people.Live rest of your life with your family fully,Jaycee. God bless you!! All in all, I advice this book to everyone if one stands for very pathetic parts of book.
B0043FYT9G|5.0|If you love Couer de Pirate, buy this immediately.  The DVD it includes is worth the price alone.  Great life versions of the songs.  The book is beautifully done as well.  Highly recommended!!  Great seller - extremely fast and immaculate condition. Excellent.

0553801473|1.0|This was the most boring of all the novels. The first two books were the best, thereafter, GRRM just wandered off. Nothing of substance has happened in the last book or in this one. All the characters remained where they were or kept meandering from one meaningless adventure to another. What a let down!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I didnt realize before reading this book just the extent of what she went through...i didnt even know she had kids through this ordeal..this is a very blunt bare all story...i really felt for her and cannot imagine surviving this ordeal.  But i simply just couldnt put this book down
B000G75AE8|5.0|I thought it would be good to post a review of this album after giving it a long, 5 year listen. Christ illusion stands up to the best in Slayer's catalog. Yes, I know... you may not agree but I have to say that after spending time with their catalogue (I own it all), Christ Illusion is one of my \\"Go-to\\" Slayer albums. The Bostof years were ok. God Hates Us All is solid, but Christ Illusion hits it out of the park. The band draws a lot from the wars in the Middle east, making may direct connections to war and politics from religion. It is under this context that Slayer's violent and dark imagery matures from its earlier, more satanic works. Yes... they still mention satan, but it always in regards to it being the lesser of two evils. When ranting about the evils of war and religion (christian), Slayer responds \\"I've made my choice, 666\\".   Christ Illusion is aggressive and brutal, but not slow and prodding (like their previous efforts). With Lombardo back on the drums, they seem to have rekindled that old, evil flame.  Highlights: Skeleton Christ, Cult, Flesh Storm, Jihad     I love this record and highly recommend it.
B003Y5H59W|3.0|I was pretty happy with this 2011 Marvel Comics release in the theaters.  It was no award winner--just good entertainment and on an incredibly humid 105 degree day in Baltimore (yuk).  I don't remember any foul language either.  It was a war movie, so people got shot and killed everywhere, but they did not focus on blood and guts, thank God!  I saw it in 3D, but I don't believe the 3D really added much.<br /><br />Steve Rogers, from Brooklyn NY, is a guy who wants to join the military and serve his country so bad he can taste it.  It is March, 1942, so WWII is going strong.  Steve is pretty small and \\"puny,\\" and gets rejected 4F every time he applies.  He is in the right place at the right time when a scientist overhears him about to apply again and decides Steve is perfect for a secret government experiment.  Steve is classified 1A by Dr Abraham, given a special serum injection, and he becomes a lean-mean (muscular) fighting machine.  His metabolism is about 4 times faster than other guys, his muscles are expanded at the cellular level, and he can run fast as heck, jump on top of taxis, and stuff like that.  We are told early on that the puny guy was selected because he had a good heart and the serum amplifies the inner characteristics a person already has.  Initially, Steve becomes part of a War Bond show for the army, but as you would have guessed anyway, soon finds a way to get in the war.<br /><br />The evil force is Nazi Johann Schmidt (aka Red Skull), who is looking for a way to win the war for Germany and Herr Hitler.  Tommy Lee Jones is a military commander, also involved in the secret project, and as always, is exceptionally good in his role.  Federal Agent Peggy provides an Army Girl presence, quite capable of kicking butt. There is also a pleasing innocence about Steve's character.<br /><br />Lots of action--It is probably more of a \\"guy\\" movie (generally) because it is primarily a war movie.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Of all of the headphones I've used to date, I've found that these ones definitely offer the most \\"bang for your buck!\\" I highly recommend them. In fact, I can't recommend them enough. I'm on my third pair, and I've consistently experienced the same quality from each.<br /><br />Here are the short, sweet points:<br /><br />1) Ninety percent of the time, I use mine for running and biking with my iPhone/iPod. I sweat obnoxiously, and they still hold up against the \\"moisture\\" (which is an understatement). They're definitely durable. If you're that athlete hunting for \\"the pair\\", these are a solid bet to go with!<br /><br />2) They really don't kid about the \\"ultra lightweight\\" aspect! These are amazingly lightweight and flexible, and that lends to an amazing fit. They don't hurt my ears (or head) from pushing or squeezing too firmly.<br /><br />3) The sound quality is great for my standards. These compare (or surpass) any I've used.<br /><br />4) The only (minor) issue I experience is that if they ever come out of my ears for a moment (i.e. I bump them or take them out to say \\"hey\\" to someone), sweat can get into my ear, and they sometimes run into issues. It's rare, and the results are typically minor, but it can create that \\"underwater\\" effect, reducing the volume and quality slightly. Usually, a simple re-shift or drying out of my ear will alleviate the problem.<br /><br />5) If was being really picky, I'd say they could also benefit from a cord management system (e.g. a free clip). However, relative to others, they have a pretty ideal cord length (i.e. as little excess as seems possible).<br /><br />If you've read this far and want my typical \\"wordier\\" review, read on for my follow-up points:<br /><br />1) Sweat/Life: Like anything, they're not invincible. They don't even claim to be waterproof, so more power to them! Typically after five to six months of using each pair daily, they eventually bite the dust. That's from one to two hour workouts, constantly being chucked in and out of a gym bag, and surviving whatever other wears come their way. Toward the end of their life, I'll eventually begin to experience an occasional short-out in one of the speakers during the \\"peak\\" of my workout (a.ka. the part where I sweat nastiest). However, they'll dry out by the next day and be good to go. After about another month of this routine, they'll become unusable. From my experience, that's a great lifespan- especially for the price you can find these at.<br /><br />2) Fit: They sit so gently set in my ear canals, yet they stay in so well. I've never had them come off unless I accidentally knock them off. Honestly, I've sort of \\"forgotten\\" I have them in at times. Because I don't think about them, I've gone to scratch my head or wipe sweat, and I've dumbly knocked them lose. They're design blows my mind. It's just so ideal. I've even gone through a number of hair-dos (ranging from longer to completely buzzed), and they still stay on just as well. They're very adjustable because of a precise range of ratcheted positions.<br /><br />3) Sound Quality: I can't say I've owned \\"premium sound\\" sound sport headphones, so this is always the toughest part for me to review. I like to think that I know good sound and appreciate high quality. Based on that alone, I say these are great. I pump songs with heavy bass (i.e. budstep, rock, etc...), and they sound great to me. More \\"objectively\\", I can at least compare them to other things like my premium car audio, Apple Earbuds, and so forth. Based on all of that, they sound just as good to me.<br /><br />4) Sweat (Part 2): I don't have much extra to say here. Basically, this is rarely an issue, but it's a point worth noting. Because they're not water proof, they don't have any special seals. I just make a habit of not taking them out until I'm done, and everything is usually fine. I just pause my music if I need to stop and hear something. And that's not to say I can't ever take them out. I've done so many times without any problem. It's just a rule I've made to avoid even risking it.<br /><br />5) Cord Management: I rarely notice this problem. I generally just let them hang and don't run into issues. Because of they're great fit, I can easily throw the cord behind me or wear it down the front- depending on how I'm working out. On rare occasions, I use a clip from an old pair of headphones, and that helps a lot. Personally, I just hate dealing with clips, so it's almost not even worth the extra effort.<br /><br />It might be important to note that I have used several various headphones over the years, and these are what I ended up on. To give you some comparison, I have tried various Apple \\"Earbuds\\" (i.e. [[ASIN:B004DEPOA0 Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic (NEWEST VERSION)[Retail Packaging]]]), Griffin TuneBuds (i.e. [[ASIN:B0015ADWMW Griffin TuneBuds Mobile for iPhone 3G, 3GS  (Black)]]), and even nicer Sennheiser sport sets (i.e. [[ASIN:B001GT185K Sennheiser  PMX80  In-Ear Sport Series II Behind the Head Earphones]]).
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is one of the best shows to come to tv. Great lines, amazing plot, hilarious and smart. The characters are so lovable too specially Castle and his relationship with Beckett is so much fun to watch. You become emotionally involved. The dvd's themselves seem to skip in three episodes though. Other than that, you must watch this show.

B001DCQIAA|3.0|With the exception of 4, Karajan kept his distance from Schumann. After a performance of 2, he was heard to say 'never again.' One wonders why: the Rhenish in particular was ideally suited to his craft. Karajan the amateur mountaineer is also to the fore: he aptly distinguishes between the \\"shoulders\\" and true summit in the First. He's also alive to the adrenalin of these works. At the height of their prowess, the Berlin Phil revel in the music. Ever so predictably, this cycle is the front-runner in the market.<br /><br />Anyone who once owned the LPs would know that the 1990-ish remastering was mismanaged: they were denuded of their bass. The 1995 remastering of the First [[ASIN:B000001GQ5 Brahms, Schumann: Symphony No. 1 / Karajan, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] demonstrated that the original sonics can be restored in all their glory. While DG have thrown in the 1985 / VPO Fourth (a fine performance) and the Overture, Scherzo and Finale( for what it is worth), it beggars belief that they did not remaster the cycle (and this comment holds true for the Karajan Edition). Cupidity is palpable. They want to milk the market one more time: us.<br /><br />In short, this is a repackaging exercise with two additional works thrown in. If you acquire this box, it's an interim purchase at best. The day will surely come when we no longer \\"look through the glass darkly.\\"
B004HO6HWK|3.0|Statham knows the drill, and he puts in a typically cool, tough guy performance. Ben Foster puts in his typical skeezy punk performance. There aren't a lot of surprises, but it's fun to watch everyone go through the paces in this somewhat paint by numbers hitman movie. The fights are good, without too much reliance on quick-cutting, and none of the irritating extreme close-ups that are so in vogue right now. It's occasionally brutal, frequently grim, and likely forgettable.<br />P.S<br />I am 80schild/old school & Only thing makes me laugh & B.S to me these days in movies..They CUT out cigarette smoking in movies,like pass few movies i saw & Crank UP the Alcohol & Drugs instead, like those things don't kill you But Cigarette dose!lol, WTF!

B00134XIYM|5.0|Amy Winehouse is gone. The news is sad for many reasons, but it does drive us back to our CD collection to reevaluate her gifts - and they were extraordinary. This CD plus DVD album is probably her best known and certainly the number of Grammy Awards would indicate that. Just the lead song 'Rehab' is worth the price of the recording.<br /><br />Winehouse created a sensation both in the musical world with what was indelibly her own style.

It seems like every generation has a wounded sparrow - Edith Piaf, Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin. And like those who came before her she was as much a star off stage as she was on stage. Now at age 27 she is gone, but with songs such as Rehab, You Know I'm No Good, Just Friends, Back To Black, Love Is A Losing Game and Tears Dry On Their Own her memory will live on.

B001PB3RU8|3.0|After hearing her \\"Dog Days\\" song on \\"Gossip Girl\\" and reading all the hype - I took the risk and bought this CD.  Her yodeling and the lack of tone colors to her voice gets irritating FAST!  Her songwriting skills are sketchy.  The best thing I can say about this CD is that it's loud and energetic.  She sounds a little like Grace Slick sometimes - but less refined.  Grace Slick was a far better singer.  I don't hear any similarity to Joni Mitchell, at all!  That's an insult to Ms. Mitchell!
B00532A8JI|3.0|Being a Symphony-X fan from the start, I have to say that this is their most disappointing album.  The strong instrumentals are so far in the background or just simply gone in favor of a near grunge \\"this all sounds alike\\" sound that you long for any song to have a resemnblence of previous outputs.  Their best was simply The Odyssey, which contained such a wide variety with hard vocals followed by soft with a showcase of all their talents. Iconoclast simply showcases a ton of guitar riffs (which are good)and puts the groups other strengths on the back burner.   It seems they ran out of the inspiration that truly amazed me from the start.  The lyrics are weak, every song is burdened by a lack of diversity that I've come so used to (and taken for granted) as one of Symphony-X's trademarks.  Another thing that was incredibly disappointing was this album throws in profanity for no real reason.  One of the strengths of Symphony-X was their incredible lyrics with an amazing blend of piano, guitar and orchestration at times.  They were the breath of fresh air I had waited for for years!  So I turn this album on and in a dime-a-dozen grunge sound, they pop off with \\"SOB\\" in their song, I was shocked.  I always considered this group one of the more intelligent, as they proved that you could have the greatest albums without turning sterotypical.  What's sad is now I have to wait a few more years to see if they correct themselves.  I still gave this three stars simply because I don't hate it.  If this were another group, I'd say, \\"not bad\\", but what I've come to expect from this group is certainly not what I got this time.  Symphony-X is still my favorite group (excluding this album), and hopefully they get back on track and have their next album score a classic piece of literature, like Jekyll and Hyde and put some real emotion and thought back into their music, and leave the grunge and profanity to the weaker metal groups.

1932100660|5.0|I wish everyone in the US would read AND APPLY this book for a healthier life and for a stronger nation. The body is made up of food - from the day we are born till the day we die. It would be quite foolish to believe that nutrition does not play a part in our health, as suggested by many medical professionals, who lack the knowledge about link between nutrition and health themselves. Any person who understands the importance of good health towards a happy life cannot afford to miss this book and its implications. Not all adjustments are easy but when they are as important as this one they are worth a try.
B000XUBF3I|4.0|I am a mother with a full time job.  A few years back, when I was not working (with two young children), I subscribed to flylady site but the amount of material/info was overwhelming.  I was getting several emails a day to motivate me to \\"clean up this or that\\".  I have never been a particularly messy person, and I typically have a rather orderly, clean house; but like everyone, clutter, kids, dishes, etc.  is a constant challenge, and I have had occasional bouts of CHAOS.  I always remembered flylady though as being a good system w/ babysteps.  I decided to purchase the book recently so I could have all the info under one roof, so to speak.  There was a lot of fluff (cheesy, oprah-esque type things, new agey, religious, which I'm not into).   But, it was still worth buying, because of the \\"control journal\\" part, to set up your cleaning schedule.  I call it my \\"housekeeping journal\\".  I work full time, and prior to setting this system up, I used to do all my cleaning on a Saturday morning (for four hours) and mini-cleaning in between. This took a great deal of time, since my kids usually needed to be shuttled off to this or that event.  Plus, Sunday's is laundry, and I feel that there is no break.  Flylady helped me design my \\"control\\" / housekeeping journal.  I didn't take every single thing that she suggested, but I took most of the ideas and made them my own.  In my journal (which I printed out and put in three ring binder, in plastic folders), I have my daily plan, weekly plan, monthly plan, the \\"zones\\", my \\"zone routine\\" and a calendar for the year (that I printed free on internet).  Daily plan is nothing more than a condensation of flylady's morning and evening routines.  Quick mini pickups, etc., no more than 20 min.  The weekly plan is more important.  Since I don't want to spend hours on Saturday cleaning, I devised the following to do after work.      Monday:  Dust/mirrors/doors.    Tues:  Mop/vaccuum/refrigerator wipe.    Wed:  Bathrooms.    Thursday:  Work on current zone/hot spot, & \\"30 fling boogie\\".  Flylady does a 27 fling boogie, but I do 30 because there are 30 days/month.  My \\"boogie\\" involves going around the house and collecting a total of 30 things to either throw or donate.  Sometimes they're big things (like books) and sometimes they're small (like a receipt).  Donations go right in the car trunk.   Friday:  Work on current zone/hot spot and drop donated goods off.    Saturday is laundry/clean car.    Sunday is free.    As far as zones go, I have five zones based on the calendar.  I marked which zones I need to focus on per week.  I have combined areas, so zone 1 is \\"entrance, porch, laundry room\\", etc.  Zone 2 is kitchen.  Zone 3 is bathrooms.  Zone 4 is bedrooms/closets.  Zone 5 is family rooms/hallway.  Whichever zone I am scheduled to do on the week is dealt with on Thursday/Friday.  Zone cleaning involves deep cleaning/details, baseboards, the more \\"nitty gritty things\\".  I am only talking a half hour-45 min or so, no more. Breaking up my routine over the course of the week has been helpful.  Flylady is motivating, and I love the \\"control/housekeeping journal\\".
B004A8ZX28|5.0|If you like Hitchcock movies like North by Northwest, you'll love this one.  A guy is injured in an auto accident in Berlin, spends four days in a coma, then awakes to find no one, including his wife, knows him.  Everything has changed.  He checks his employer's website, and another guy's picture appears under his name.  Confused, he begins to investigate.  The cops think he's a nutcase.  I won't put in any spoilers here, but you will never guess the ending in a million years.  Highly recommended, one of the best flicks we've seen in a long time.

B00457X7XQ|5.0|I've known for years that Mark could code (sysinternals, if that rings a bell).  Now I know he can write.<br /><br />I teach security to senior managers for a living. Everything he said in the book is at least plausible and frighteningly likely.<br /><br />In addition to all the geek-out stuff (presented with a light but accurate touch) there's a good story well seasoned with lots of delicious ingredients such as politics, inter-agency squabbling, money making schemes, romance and trust.<br /><br />You could read it as science fiction (think wargames with some intelligence). You could read it as a prophecy of the next terrorist strike. Just read it.<br /><br />Here's an easy way to see if you'll like this book. Watch the free TED talk from Mikko Hyponnen, CTO of F-Secure. He says much the same thing in his 18 minute talk (minus the \\"seasoning\\"). If you find the talk intriguing, scary or even jaw-dropping, then you'll love this book.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I missed a few episodes at the beginning of the first season until I realized how good this show is and how easy it was to get hooked on it.  It was a great gift that I received and I was able to catch up on all of the details that I had missed.  It helped me to understand things   better bringing me up to where the season is today.  I love to watch it over and over as this is a great series.
0525422943|5.0|Not having read IF I STAY, I have to admit I was at a bit of a disadvantage compared to those who did read it because they were familiar with what happened to Mia, her accident, and her romance with Adam. However, I did have the advantage of seeing the entire relationship and fallout from Adam's perspective only and being completely submerged in his dark and tormented mind.<br /><br />After Mia's terrible accident and her subsequent walk-out on their relationship, Adam sunk into a deep funk, moving back home with his parents and pretty much ditching his bandmates. But his depression eventually turns to anger, and he finally returns to his music, pouring all his anger into harshly beautiful songs that, once recorded, propel him and his band into the stratosphere. Unfortunately, as he wallowed in his depression, his bandmates believed he abandoned them and they aren't so quick to forgive his return, even if he does come bearing fantastic music. This rift widens as people focus on him as the band's lead, treating the rest of the band as back-up to Adam's awesomeness.<br /><br />Three years later, we find Adam with fame, fortune, and a gorgeous movie star for a girlfriend. But he's cut himself off from his bandmates and former friends, doesn't enjoy or even feel the music anymore, and has retreated back into his shell, numbing his pain with prescription pills and drink. Then he sees an advertisement for Mia's recital and decides to go, just so he can see her one more time.<br /><br />Gayle Forman is a master at getting inside her character's head and exposing his pain for all the world to see. WHERE SHE WENT is a  beautifully-crafted, dark journey from the depths of despair back into the light of love.

B002T9H2MO|5.0|Released to coincide with celebrations of the 40th anniversary of man's landing on the Moon,this indie sci-fi debut time film of Duncan Jones(David Bowie's son),has a retrospective feel to it as if it's not only looking back over the last 40 years of man's space flights,Jones is also adept at quoting filmic references from all the films in this genre:Silent Running,Outland,Alien,Solaris and 2001.Sam Rockwell plays a lone astronaut space-miner,Sam Bell, engaged in extracting highly valuable Helium 3 from moon rocks to be shipped back to Earth to fuel the energy-starved planet.Sam's isolated posting is about to come to an end.His only company has been Gerty (voiced by Spacey),the base's Hal-like robot,which is a mobile computer.Sam can't communicate directly with Earth as the communication satellite has apparently broken down,but he receives taped messages from his wife Tess and  little daughter Eve.A terrible accident on the lunar surface leads to a disturbing discovery that contributes to his growing sense of paranoia and dislocation so many miles from home.His 3 year term is almost over but he is undergoing hallucinations. Is the strangeness only in his mind or is it actually happening?He's physically degrading,coughing up blood, losing teeth.,he suffers memory loss,wakes up in the infirmary,not knowing how he got there.He thinks he's seen a clone of himself.    This is old fashioned sci-fi in the best sense of an ideas-and-character-driven vehicle.Forget CGI,flashy action or time warps,it questions who is or isn't fully human,and explores empathy in forms of alien intelligence.Gerty is softly spoken,therapeutic or is he?What would you do if you found out you were a clone?Rockwell differentiates his differing-yet-similar personae.Sam finds he's both less alone and yet far more alone than he ever imagined. Rockwell's performance is a tour-de-force. The scenes between Sam and his daughter and the other Sam have lots of heart. The interior of the base is appropriatelylow-tech and lived-in; scenes set on the moon's surface are functional but perfectly adequate. Jones overcomes the limitations of his $5 million budget to witty use: Gerty expresses its reactions through a small screen that displays a range of elementary emoticons, which is vivid and oddly endearing.Lunar Industries is an evil corporation willing to manipulate and even sacrifice its employees in pursuit of profit (reference to the Alien series, at least), and a desperate race to prepare for the arrival of the ominous \\"rescue party\\" complete with periodic shots of a countdown clock The rougher \\"retro\\"feel of this film reminds us of the limited progress in space exploration,the end of the shuttle program,the loss of the initial euphoria once man had landed on the moon.Bill Pearson,the designer used in Alien was used for space suits and robo-vehicles and Clint Manseel (Requiem for a Dream)created the excellent sound track.An intelligent feature debut.America no longer has a vehicle to take it into space.Spot on!
B00005KHEU|5.0|It is interesting to read the other reviews and see what other people consider the best ELO cd.  Of course one opinion is as valid as the next, but I decided to add my two cents worth as a big fan.  I have eight of the ELO re-issues, as well as Xanadu, and Flashback.  Twilight on \\"Time\\" is probably my favorite song, but I think Discovery is probably my favorite album.  The first single was \\"Shine A Little Love\\" and ELO was definitely flirting with disco here.  Fortunately, this is a well written, classy song and has aged better than most disco.  The group's sound didn't change much, and those who criticize them for turning disco or selling out probably aren't familiar with the entire catalog of the group.  \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" was the second single, and was a catchy rocker.  It is incredibly infectious, even if the lyric in the chorus contains the word \\"Grooooos\\" (sp?).  Discovery was one of the relatively few records at that time to chart four singles, and several more were good enough to chart, too.  One of the most mentioned songs in the previous reviews is \\"The Diary Of Horace Wimp.\\"  I don't dislike the song, but I suppose I belong to the camp that doesn't care for it.  This is the only song on the record I like, but don't love.  I noted several reviewers compared the songwriting style on \\"Horace\\" to that of the Beatles.  I would assert that the songwriting throughout the entire album is Beatle-esque.  \\"Discovery\\" is both a product of it's time and timeless.  While it does sound like it came from the late 70's, it sounds like a classic.  I never grow tired of it and it never seems to grow old.  The re-issue has three additional cuts. Two are basically snippets and I didn't find them interesting, even as a fan.  However, \\"Little Town Flirt\\" is absolutely delightful and a wonderful bonus.  While it doesn't really fit in with the other cuts, I included it on my \\"best of ELO\\" playlist on my ipod.  The ELO re-issues are among my favorites.  I would recommend any ofthem, but \\"Discovery\\" is a discovery to celebrate.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Hard to find anything bad to say about this app with the ease to set up and the auto correct function is personalized for the owner of the phone.

B005DD7H50|2.0|this film has a ton of good reviews & i am, generally speaking, in agreement with the masses on action flicks. this is the exception. the first 15 minutes are pretty darn good, but after that the plot begins to fray at the edges - and eventually, it comes apart. perhaps the issue (for me) is that there is very little character development for any of the supporting roles? the lack of resolution to what would seem to be pretty major events? the vast leap in direction in the last few minutes? or the totally anti-climatic ending? likley a bit of all.     this would be a great series for one of the networks to pick up...and if a writer were to follow all of the heretofore unpursued angles presented in the film? i betcha they'd get an easy 2 or 3 seasons out of it without searching for new ideas.     no. i wouldn't recommend this film. as excited as i was to see it - it was a let down. but a whole lot of other folks liked it...

B003WO4UIE|3.0|When it has came down to great music, there just hasn't been any strong artists that have really shown their absolute driven colors. But there are some artists who've had great guilty pleasures during their hey day. Bryan Adams has had some really strong song from the 80's and 90's that still sound just as vibrant and fresh today, as they did back when they first came out. But he hasn't had anything new and fresh for die hard fans for awhile, and instead chose to focus on the classics that made him one of Canada's best imports. Now another greatest hits albums showcases what made him great. But is it worth its money, well yes and no.<br /><br />Icon: Bryan Adams is a reflection of what made Bryan Adams so strong in the first place. The collection is not anything really strong for die hard Bryan Adams fans, but still simpple and welcoming for newcomers. The collection of songs focuses on Bryan's biggest hits, but not really anything surprising. The songs have all been remastered well, and include a lot of his classics like Everything I Do (I Do It For You,) the classic Heaven, Cuts Like A Knife, Run To You, and Can't Stop This Thing We Started. The collection of songs isn't bad, but still there were a lot of classics that were overlooked from the collection. The album overlooks some of his classics like It's Only Love with the legendary Tina Turner, All For Love with Rod Stewart and Sting, and Please Forgive Me to just name a few.<br /><br />Overall Icon: Bryan Adams isn't a bad greatest hits collection, but not anything that really makes its definitive or stand out compared to his other hits collections. If you're a die hard fan of his, I absolutely recommend one of his other hits albums like 2005's Anthology, or the classic 1993 hits album So Far So Good. But as for Icon: Bryan Adams it fairs as a decent sampler for anyone that wants to hear some of the best power ballads from one of Canada's best imports from the 80's.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C+<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Remastering: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+B-    Overall: C+
B00005MP58|5.0|Love Jane Austen? Well, then, you need to see this one! It is so rare to see an accurate adaptation of this ilk. The casting is perfect and very believable, the locations are beautiful, and most of the dialogue comes straight from the book. Keep in mind that the entire story is long because it was originally broken up in parts for a miniseries. Even the special features including interviews with various cast members are a nice and interesting addition. This DVD is a must for lovers of Pride and Prejudice.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|So I finished Mockingjay, the third and final book in the the trilogy, and I'm trying to describe how I feel.  In one word: disappointed.  Here's why.<br /><br />The first book, The Hunger games, was so completely different and unique than anything else I've read.  It looks at life and death from a perspective that you can't help but read in awe.  As I mentioned in my review of this book, you can't put it down and you move through so many emotions, it feels like a huge roller coaster.  When I finished, I couldn't wait to find out what was next.<br /><br />Book two, Catching Fire was a natural progression of the trilogy (like it should be) and it answered many of the questions which remained for me after reading The Hunger Games.  A number of surprises were still in store - granted not as many as in the first book, but that should be expected - and I still felt engaged in the story as well as the characters.  For me, this second book (per my review) was good but nothing like the first.<br /><br />Enter Mockingjay, the final book.  As with Catching Fire, you're thrown back into the mix of the deluge of war, destruction as well as a bit of confusion (not going to spoil what I mean) with \\"The War.\\"  However, the multiple threads that are woven into the book are nicely done and enjoyable.  Collins does a good job of bringing the book full circle without becoming too over-the-top (i.e. \\"corny\\").  Thank you to her and her team for this - it would have completely ruined the book for me.<br /><br />The downside to me, which is why I gave it three stars was simply because it felt like this book was written for the silver screen.  It felt so \\"Hollywood\\" for me.  The drama was there, but it was predictable.  The love story was there, and it too, was predictable.  The rebellion felt cliche and just, frankly, boring.  While there were moments of suspense, it became hard to turn the pages which, I guess, when the bar is set so high (The Hunger Games) is inevitable.<br /><br />I will say that if you're a diehard fan of The Hunger Games and loved the first and second books equally, you will probably love the third and final installment.  Although, if you're like me and found Catching Fire was definitely not as good as the first, you'll likely be a bit disappointed with Mockingjay - hopefully not, but perhaps.<br /><br />So, as I sit here and type this, I look forward to seeing how this entire series will be depicted by the hollywood writers, directors and producers.  I hope they do NOT divide the movie into installments (a la Harry Potter) because I think it would fall flat.  I could be wrong but only time will tell.  I look forward to their interpretation.<br /><br />My bottom line for Mockingjay is: if you read the first two, you really have to read the final book.  You may have a feeling of loss, like I did, when you turn the last page (epilogue included), like meal that started off fabulously but ultimately lost it's way midcourse.he Hunger Games and loved the first and second books equally, you will probably love the third and final installment.

0553801473|5.0|A Song of Fire and Ice is one of the few fantasy series which becomes more enjoyable with each novel released.  A Dance with Dragons was a long time coming but the wait was worth it.<br /><br />About half of the main characters were missing from A Feast for Crows, so I thought that Dance would show the same period of time from different viewpoints instead of advancing the story. This is not the case.<br /><br />About 1/4th of Dance overlaps with the previous novel.  After that the overall plot advances and takes some interesting turns. Characters absent from Feast such as Jon Snow and Tyrion tell the majority of Dance, but Jaime, Arya, and others also have a few chapters.<br /><br />Martin has not dropped the ball. A Dance with Dragons is just as good as Game of Thrones, and even more fun to read.

1400052181|4.0|My wife says every medical and nursing student should have to read this book, but as an English teacher, I found it an incredible story.  The author intertwines the story of Henrietta Lacks with the medical breakthroughs brought about by her cells.  I gave it 4 stars only because I thought it had too many medical details for me, but I realize that was necessary, and the story is so worth reading.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|I actually liked this one,although I SERIOUSLY hated eclipse(sorry stephanie but I did).By the way I'm a girl,Brent's daughter.I didn't like all the sappy 'Edward' crap Bella says all time.Anyway I thought it was extremely like Alice to try to get Bella to be bold for her wedding and whatnot.And I really wanted it to be a fantasy beautiful wedding,but I didn't write it.And(spoilers)when they get to the island,all Bella ever thinks about is their friekin bed and eating(but then again she was pregnant I can't blame her).I thought it was a little stupid of Bella to call ROSALIE but it was sweet because she had always wanted a family.And when she (I quess you could call it immediate labor)it was a bit scary and I had hoped Edward would bite her instead.I think Reneesmee is sooooo cute and then Nessie aww[...] Jacob goes and imprints on her and I really wanted stephaie to go on and d something with Jacob and Renesmee like when they get married and have living kids if they could.But overall Stephanie it was good and I liked it.Thanx
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|I really, really, enjoy the music of Mahler, and so this set lives up to my expectations and more.  The sound is exquisite, when played at a lower volume, or turned up to a ceiling shaking sound.  It seems as if I'm there as the conductor - each instrument is heard so well.  I have a number of sets, and dozens of disks playing the individual symphonies, but this set presently takes the place of honor in my collection.  I wish I could give it ten stars!!

B0011HF6GE|5.0|This album sets the bar for indie music. It has beautiful and slow melodies that, personally, brought me to tears. I love this album and I am very very happy I bought it. I sincerely recommend it to anyone, indie fan or not. It is well worth any price set on it.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I couldn't wait to get this product, as I had been wanting it for several months.     1. The case it comes in is very cheap and was mostly broken when it arrived, so much so that I had to go out and buy a special case for it myself.     2. There was supposed to be included in the package an aniversary poster, which wasn't there. I don't particularly care about the poster, but if it is advertised, it should at least be there.    3. Once I got past the issue of the case, I noticed that the first few discs I looked at had damage INSIDE the disc itself, not a scratch on the outside, but damage on the inside, under the outter film. So far I have watched 8 or 10 episodes, 2 of which have glitches. Almost every disc in the set has this damage and I am leary of the results once I start watching more episodes.    4. I purchased a new version of the product vs. a used one, and most of the discs were not even in order, by episode OR by season. I had to re-sort them myself just to be sure they were all there.....at this point, I'm still not sure.    My final review of this product? For the money I paid and as long as I waited to be able to buy it? It's a JOKE and I'm not happy at all. I will be much more careful and do much more research in the future reguarding this type of product and the company who produced it. I have purchased many items (cd's mostly) from Amazon and have been very happy with them, but this one most certainly was a bomb and I do not recommend it.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I totally agree... \\"If you can handle it, see it.\\"  Definitely a flick for horror/gore fans.  Not for the squeamish!  A classic \\"revenge\\" film.  I loved it...and it may go down as the most gruesome film I've ever seen.  Only for those who enjoy this genre.  All 5 stars!

However, I remember seeing this movie as a child as being sort of my first horror movie experience with the grotesque Skeksis creatures.  Seeing it today brings back many memories, but the special features make it a truly educational let alone entertaining experience, seeing where we were and where we are now.    On a fictional planet, the Skeksis rule their planet with an iron fist with their evil and draining the world of all it has to offer.  Only a few remain, having been split in half into their evil (Skeksis) and good (Mystics) sides when the crystal cracked.  According to myth and legend, only a Gelfling (an elflike creature), is capable of restoring the crystal by replacing the missing shard.  The Skeksis have long since exterminated this race of creature to ensure their power.  However, one lone Gelfling boy named Jen was rescued by a Mystic and raised alone in their valley.  While on his deathbed, his master Mystic tells him of his quest that he must fulfill.  So Jen embarks on the quest to replace the shard of the Dark Crystal, meeting another surviving Gelfling (Kira) who also survived the extermination of the Skeksis, and restore good to their world.    Seeing a movie like this is rather surprising today, considering that it took five years to complete it.  Today everything is all digital, but in those days it was all by hand of complex puppets, make up, costume design, and landscapes.  The special features are of great detail of how they came up with the story, designing the sets and elaborate costumes.  Sometimes we forget just how hard people work at these things and how far we have come in order to make these outstanding creatures.  Also, as the Skeksis and all things within their castle are so hideous and ugly, this was a true visual horror movie.  It was quite a departure from Jim Henson's previous works with the Muppets (even though that was/is whathe is most famous for).  Today kids may not quite understand what is going on, as these things were done by hand rather than with CGI, but it was more of an appreciation for how movie magic is made today.

B000P12LWY|4.0|One of the most written about people in all of history, Henry VIII was a man who truly changed history.  For the better?  For anything other than personal gain?  We have yet to decide.  However, perhaps we have to look at the man himself as well as the times he was living in to make our decision for the better.    Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Henry, the golden child whose father put on the throne after the War of the Roses who is ruling England.  He is a man living with all the spoils of power and enjoying it to its fullest, mostly with him romping in and out of bed with as many women as possible (not caring whose wife or daughter he might be sleeping with).  Behind the scenes, his political powers are being challenged from abroad (the King of Spain), members of the church (Cardinal Wolsey), and others in his court and aristocracy.  His biggest concern, however, is that he was unable to produce a son and carry on his name.  He married his brother's widow, Catherine of Aragon, upon his brother's death to keep his alliance with Spain.  They had only one surviving child, a daughter, Mary, and Catherine was no longer able to have children.  Always in the back of his mind is the fact that he has not had a son and there would be no one to carry on his legacy.  Enter the lusty, saucy, and rather busty Boelyn daughters.  Anne Boelyn's older sister, who had always been a footnote to history until just recently, has a small part in this series (as she would in Henry's story in real life) who restores his hope.  She gives birth to a son by Henry.  Perhaps if Henry were to marry her sister Anne, she too would produce that much needed for son.  So, amid much anger and debate from officials from the church, Henry declares his marriage to Catherine of Aragon null and void, divorces, makes himself head of the church of England, and rewrites history.    Let's face it, do we really want to know so many things about political and religious alliances?  Not really, sex sells to us.  Perhaps that's why we are still obsessed with this story.  Henry is randy, has many lovers, and he's still young and cute rather than the fat, hairy man we know from paintings.  We're all about how he could take such liberties, his power and control.  And to see the pain and suffering of his first wife, Catherine of Aragon is real drama.  She loved him and wanted to make him happy, and he left her in the dust.
B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|I'm a huge REM fan but this is the first release by them that I can't recommend to friends.  In my opinion the production is just awful, I bought the vinyl and the downloads and both sound equally poor.   The loud songs are so harsh and fizzy that turning down the volume is the first real sense of joy I felt with this one.  The second sense of joy was \\"Walk It Back\\", a gem where Michael gives a great vocal.  Time for R.E.M. to find a decent production team and avoid the horrific over compressed sound of the 00's.    In contrast, the Decemberists new CD with Peter Buck on it sounds fantastic and is easy to enjoy at all volumes.    I buy quite a bit of vinyl and Jackknife Lee produced records are some of the very few that sound lousy even on vinyl.  I'm hoping they move on to a good producer along with U2 and Snow Patrol to create great sounding releases that you would expect from bands at this level.    Kudos to the band though for having Mobile Fidelity involved in their recent reissue of \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\".
0316154687|3.0|I live in France and frequently travel to Japan, and was raised in the south, so Sederis's \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\" hits lots of my interest notes.<br /><br />But these essays are less \\"larf-out-load\\" funny yuk-yuk humor and more middle-aged, mellow, poignant, and insightful. If you are looking for \\"me Talk Pretty One Day\\" repeat, you won't find it here.<br /><br />Instead, he writes of his parents collecting low-brow \\"art\\" from a local dealer, a boil that causes him to reflect on his own mortality, how he established intimacy and fear equilibrium with his partner Hugh, befriending a local eccentric who is revealed to be a pederast and shunned in his tiny week-end country home community, and of course....his lifelong love of smoking.<br /><br />The last third of the book is an extended personal narrative and story arc of his beginning and quitting smoking, interspersed with our own culture's brawny acceptance of smoking (witness the popularity of \\"Mad Men\\") to becoming a social pariah if you smoke. It is the single best piece ever written about our American experience with the weed, as his own personal narrative as an international traveler and smoker collides with changing Western cultural values. He retreats to Japan to quit smoking, and his 30 day and 45 day arc accounts are memorable.<br /><br />This isn't funny Sederis, this is insightful Sederis. Perhaps because he and I are the same age I enjoyed it very much, but it is not a laugh in every paragraph like his previous works. Nevertheless, Sederis has something to say, writes well, and is an insightful chronicler of modern times.
0316098337|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could only read a few pages at a time, because I was worried about what would happen next, whether in captivity or after. The story brought out very strong emotions from me. An amazing experience. The second half of the book is even better than the first, for much different reasons. I don't want to give anything away... I recommend this book highly to any parent who loves their children, if you have the courage to continue reading each time a frightening situation is happening. I don't recommend this book to people who have no kids, treat them like furniture, can't stand the sound of their voices, or want them in another room most of the time. Jack is a star. Congratulations to the Author for a job well done.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|Few artists can claim the legacy of consistently great music and albums, IMHO.  This album has a few highlights (My Lucky Day, Good Eye, and the bonus track The Wrestler).  The majority of the album, however, sounds tired and uninspired.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|Now playing in art theaters, this film, written and directed by Woody Allen, is an absolutely delightful comedic fantasy that kept me engaged throughout and smiling the whole time.  Actually, it was so good that I didn't want it to end.  This is saying a lot for me because I usually don't like romantic comedies.  But \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is so intellectually conceived, well paced and intelligent that I forgot all my preconceived notions about this genre.<br /><br />The film opens in modern Paris with a young couple on a pre-marriage honeymoon. Owen Wilson is cast as the future groom.  He makes a good living writing film scripts but his real ambition is to write a novel. This ambition is ridiculed by his fianc&eacute; as well her parents.  One night, not being able to stand the \\"know-it-all\\" stuffiness of a friend of the bride, he takes a walk at midnight.  Suddenly an old fashioned car from the 1920's pulls up and the partying people inside invite him in.  He then time-travels back in time to the 1920's and meets such greats as Cole Porter, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Salvador Dali and various other personages of that time.  He even gets a chance to ask Gertrude Stein, played by Kathy Bates, to give him her honest opinion of his novel.  This is a wonderland for him as well as the audience and the fast-paced script kept me completely involved as the plot developed.<br /><br />Our hero also meets Adriana, played by Marion Cotillard, and falls in love.  However, she finds the 1920's boring and glorifies the turn of the century.  Later on they are transported to that time and place only to meet the famous people who find an earlier period of time the most fascinating.  All this is very interesting and the casting is terrific, even including the First Lady of France, Carla Bruni, cast a museum tour guide.<br /><br />All this is done with all the pomp and costumes of the various eras, making for great comedy, nostalgia and authenticity.  How it all turns out is to be expected with our hero beginning a new romance in the present. It's not usual that I heap such extraordinary praise on a movie.  But this one was special and I heartily recommend it for everyone.our hero beginning a new romance in the present. It's not usual that I heap such extraordinary praise on a movie.

B0016AJU2C|2.0|Man, was this ever a painful album to endure.  Don't get me wrong; I've been a huge Alanis Morrisette fan since the angsty-90s.  I love all of her in-your-face hits including \\"Thank You\\", \\"You Oughta Know\\", \\"Crazy\\", and my personal favorite, \\"Eight Easy Steps\\".  But I could not find one single song to even like on \\"Flavors of Entaglement\\".  Instead, I felt like I was drowning in her moody misery.  I kept listening in hopes of the album getting better, to no avail.  It was a truly amuzing coincidence that just as I was searching my new ipod touch for the pause button, she sang \\"someone help me find the pause button\\".  Yes, please!  I can not listen to this whining any longer!  This album does in fact feel like Ms. Morrisette is in a therapy session -- and while every now and then she seems to feel a few rays of sun, she is definitely does not seem healed yet.  I hope Alanis' next album echos her \\"Flavors of Enlightenment\\" instead.  It's time to feel GOOD and move on!

B004SVM7BW|5.0|I have purchased both ezpdf and repligo. function wise there is not much to choose between the two. repligo certainly has more annotation functions and more control on style (like sticky notes, color choice of highlights and arrows, lines etc., adding text boxes). I will have to say though is these certainly are not worth $3 extra in terms of price. Ezpdf has some issues at the time of writing this review opening certain password protected PDFs. Some password protected pdfs do not open. Also large pdfs open with discernable lag and pages turn sluggishly. Repligo is much much faster in this regard and has opened all pdfs I have thrown at it. Again this does not justify the $3 extra. What makes up this price difference for me is the relative clarity of the displayed pdfs visually. Scanned documents have a much cleaner, smoother font in repligo and much easier on your eyes. This is particularly obvious in documents that have a small font. So if you have plans to spend long hours reading scanned PDFs in particular I would recommend buying repligo, else for light usage ezpdf is a good option with a few useful annotations thrown in.
0553801473|3.0|We have gone a long, long way from GRRM's first novel, but, alas, mainly in a qualitative sense.<br /><br />First off, somewhere along the line, this story turned into one of the most bloated mishmashes of stock literary themes and devices imaginable.  To wit:<br /><br />War of the Roses<br />I, Claudius<br />Spartacus<br />Macbeth<br />Le Femme Nikita<br />The Prince and the Pauper<br /><br />And many, many, many more, including of course Tolkien.  In this particular book, however, GRRM's pacing makes JRRT seem like freaking Hemmingway.  To call it meandering is like calling Jack the Ripper antisocial, though truth be told even Jack might have balked at treating his literary creations as GRRM has, to say nothing of his readership.  The novel is over 900 pages, but the only noteworthy plot advances from the fourth novel may be summarized in a few lines:<br /><br />1) Arya and Bran learn (respectively) assassination and skinchanging<br />2) Tyrion, Jorah, Victarion, and a newly revealed Targaryen Prince all almost make it to an encounter with Daenerys, but don't<br />3) Some Dornish Prince does eventually (and I mean event....ua...ll...y) meet Daenerys for apparently no other reason than to advance the plot a tiny bit by letting two of her Dragons escape<br />3) Theon and Asha suffer various misadventures, Boltons are not nice, some Freys die, Manderly eats food<br />4) Stannis, Melisandre, and Jon Snow blunder about in various tedious ways, Wildlings cross wall, Others lurk<br />5) Davos continues his Tour De Westeros<br />6) Various Lannisters/Tyrells/etc. engage in various no longer particularly compelling schemes, outside of possibly reanimating Gregor Glegane<br />7) Drogon the Dragon flies about, causes mischief, carries Daenerys off, almost makes the novel fun for a moment<br /><br />Actually, scratch all that.  I can summarize this book in one line: \\"A bloody cocktease\\".  To be fair, the problem here isn't that GRRM is a bad writer: it is that I no longer trust him to do anything other than string his golden goose of a story for as long as he can, whilst the eggs it lays become increasingly expensive in both cost to purchase and time/effort required to digest.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I enjoyed this adaptation in parts, but through most of it I couldn't help comparing Michael Fassbender to Toby Stephens and Mia Wasikowska to Ruth Wilson. I mean as an overall movie it was quite good, but as a fellow adaptation of the wonderful Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte it pales in comparison. The 2006 version had 4 hours to tell the story of Jane Eyre. If any viewer never watched another adaptation or read the book they would be completely lost....!
B000PKX2KA|2.0|I just received this receiver to use with Delorme Street Atlas. My first test (last night on a trip to a chamber music concert in Vermont) of this was an utter failure: when you bring up Street Atlas and turn on the GPS, the system collapses -- blue screen of death or just hangs. Every time. This is an up-to-date Windows XP system running on a Toshiba NB305 netbook, 2 GB memory. Fortunately, I'd also brought my old Garmin GPSMap 60, which got me there and back.    This morning, I did a little Googling (interesting how that's become a verb) and may have found an answer. If you are having the same problem I am, go into the Device Manager (from an account with administrator privileges) with the GPS unit plugged in, under Ports (COM and LPT), you will find the Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port. If you right-click it and click 'Properties' and then click the 'Port Settings' tab, you will find a setting for 'Flow control'. It's 'None' by default. Change it to 'Hardware'. Since doing that, I've done one test and for the first time, the system didn't fall over. As an old operating system developer, I think they are getting buffer overruns without flow control, scribbling over random memory, which will kill the system dead.    Once I've tested this more extensively, I will update this review. If it works, great. If not, it's going back.    7/27/2011 update:    The workaround described in my original review a few days ago seems to be reliable. No more OS crashes. It's absurd that they send this thing out with default driver settings that crash XP. I'm getting some use out of the device, but I'm a retired computer professional who has done a lot of OS and driver programming, and so had the instincts to recognize a promising fix when I turned it up by searching. What about an ordinary user who hasn't devoted his/her life to computer arcana?
0061564893|1.0|I am not academically qualified to judge this as an academic work. I am, however, qualified to review this as a work of fiction, which I am pretty sure it is. Compared to other works in the genre of alternate historical fiction, this is a mediocre book. If you pretend that it's not alternate historical fiction, it makes it a little bit more interesting, but not nearly as interesting as any of the books by Harry Turtledove, Robert Harris or Philip K. Dick. If you want to read an alternate historical fiction, I'm sure you'd much rather read a story some guy made up about a rebellion against the Nazis who rule the world rather than reading a story some guy made up about Chinese sailors going around the planet, building random structures and leaving boats around. There was one really cool bit though, where the chinese sailors find a bunch of mylodons (prehistoric giant sloths) and brought them back to China and New Zealand. The mylodon bit was one reason why I started to think that this book is a sham.

Meanwhile, back at Easter Island, a yellow angry bird (voiced by Hank Azaria) has some destructive plans, and Mr. Bunny (voiced by Hugh Laurie) dispatches his elite pink hit squad to find and recover E.B. before Easter.<br /><br />7. Some funny bits can be found within a rather predictable story-line, made easier by the fact that the movie opens with Fred letting the peep out of the bag.<br /><br />A great cast and slamming sound-track help this movie along, but under the eggshell that is the wonderful visual experience of the Easter factory lies a half-boiled story-line that never quite adds up to a pile of jelly beans.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 23, 2011

140053271X|5.0|I purchased the Kindle (Wi-Fi) and the original Nook (the B&W one) and tried them out during the return period. While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!<br /><br />Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the \\"slide to unlock\\" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.<br /><br />In response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N's website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.<br /><br />Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.<br /><br />The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.<br /><br />One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the \\"Shop\\" tab to access B&Ns website.  Every Friday B&N offers a free book for download, and has discounts on other days of the week.ews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.

0140143505|5.0|I love, love, love this charming book that reaches out and touches the bibliophile in me! Only one who has a life-long love affair with books will truly appreciate this story of the decades' long correspondence between Helene Hanff, a script reader/ writer living in New York, and Frank Doel, the manager of an antiquarian British bookshop, Marks & Co. The correspondence starts in the year 1949 and ends in 1968.<br /><br />These letters reveal two people who shared a similar sense of humor and a passion for old books. Ms. Hanff had a particular fondness for antiquarian books filled with wisdom - the works of John Donne, Samuel Pepys, Newman, Leigh Hunt, Walter Savage Landor, and many others. Despite making little money, Hanff develops such a fondness for the people running the bookshop that she sends them food parcels when she discovers England is being subjected to food rationing in the post-war period.<br /><br />My love for this story is not only because it is about a love of books, but also because it harkens back to a time when people actually took pains to correspond with each other (not that they had a choice), an art that is slowly dying out (I try my best to keep it alive by penning long letters to my parents who live on a different continent and who are blissfully oblivious to the wonders of e-mailing and social networking).<br /><br />84, Charing Cross Road resonates with me on so many levels, and is the perfect read on days when I'd like to just slow down and savor the pleasure of curling up with a light read. The movie adaptation starring Anne Bancroft and Sir Anthony Hopkins is another delight that perfectly captures the essence of the book. Also recommended:<br />[[ASIN:0140089365 Q's Legacy]]

1451629184|5.0|I just got done spending the day reading Jaycee Dugard's book while simultaneously listening to the audiobook and I was deeply moved by this woman's courage and the power of her autobiography. The book was compelling and it gave me a sense into both Jaycee Dugard's own present sense of self and the horror she endured and how she managed to not only survive but to write something so powerful and inspirational.
1400052181|5.0|This book was very educational for me as i did not know about this at all. i have highly recommended the book to many family and friends to share this information so they could be enlightened as well. My hat is off to the author, you really allowed me as a reader to have great visuals into your triumphs when you and Deborah discoved things as well as struggles of simply conducting the interviews. Again, I highly recommend this book. I also agree with another reviewer who said this should be required reading.
0062009540|4.0|A great series with some suspense but with a YA twist. To review this series, I am going to group the books in sets of 3. As I think, that reviewing each book may be a little excessive.<br /><br />Reading a series basically in a row - I have a fear that there will be reptition in the story as the author tries to remind the reader what happened in previous books. My thoughts in regards to this series, yes there is repeating of facts in each book, but not to an extreme. As I read them one after another, I was a little annoyed, but if I had read them with space in between it probably wouldn't have hurt to be reminded of some of the events that occured in previous books.<br /><br />These characters are funny and endearing - I grew to love them and hate them all at the same time. Each one was unique, but I could really see Ali as the glue that kept all these girls connected. As the books continued I loved trying my hand at figuring out not only who A was, but also who the killer was. At the close of book 3, I had some thoughts, but my guesses were less than educated!<br /><br />I would recommend this series to young and old alike - a great summer read. I have enjoyed going from one book to the next trying to find out the who dun its and their motives.<br /><br />I have unofficially decided to read one easy YA series or set of books each summer, so last year was Gossip Girl and this year it was Pretty Little Liars.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It's difficult, if not impossible, not to think about this book after you finish reading the last page. The story itself is, as you probably already know, horrifying, but I find the way it's written no less than outstanding. Reminding myself that she was freed from her isolated world only two years ago, it's really inconceivable how she manages to look back at those 18 years in captivity, analyze and reflect upon the events, and tell the story the way she does. I mean, thinking about how much I learned about life and relationships during my own teenage years, I'm amazed by her attitude toward life and the understanding and importance of it after not having had, more or less, no other relationships with other human beings during 18 years, except her two keepers and her two in-captivity born daughters.    Her personal strength is also what made me so lost in her book. I was especially grasped by reading the excerpts from her secret journal, which in this book reveals entries written between 1998 and 2007. This was probably the toughest and most difficult part of the book to read, as it gets very personal. It's nowhere near easy to read about the physical abuse and the living conditions either, but reading about her hopelessness, all the confusion and her lonely soul was even more difficult, at least for me. But by reading those entries, you'll also discover her genuine passion for writing. She mentioned in those entries that writing a bestseller is one of her greatest dreams. Even though this probably wasn't the way she intended becoming one, I'm still very glad for her sake that she was able to write and publish this book, and indeed making it a successful one and becoming an actual bestselling writer.    I wish you all the best, Jaycee Dugard. Thank you for accumulating enough courage to share the story and your thoughts with us. I've learned a lot about life thanks to you.

I found this book horrific and would not recommend it to anyone.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Stop ripping off fans. If you're selling a Blu-Ray in 2011, it shouldn't be a transfer from 2004. Wait for the real release and just stream this inferior version from Netflix for a few dollars if you need to watch it in the meantime.
B003L20IHE|2.0|I rented this movie on NetFlix. Would have rated it better until I discovered that the rental version did not include the Bonus portion even though it was on the menu. I guess that Universal Pictures marketing decided that they could sell DVD's if they didn't include this in the rental DVD. For me it had the opposite effect, an now when I go to buy a DVD I will make sure it is NOT Universal Pictures. I seriously doubt that people will flock to the store to buy a DVD just to get the Bonus portion. Seems like Universal Pictures has an idiotic Marketing/Management group.[[ASIN:B003L20IHE Charlie St. Cloud]]

B00004YA66|5.0|Bring Me Home Chief    Frequency is a love story, a fantastic story about the shared love between a father and his son. The connection between the two is deep and abiding, forged by a fireman's need to love, protect and guide his son, and a son's need for the safety line of love only a father can provide.      But John's father is killed in a fire wherein he heroically tries to save a young, runaway, lodged in an abandoned warehouse. For over thirty years, having grown up without the protective love of his father and then tragically without his mother's love, young John Sullivan is lost, adrift at sea.   A picture of depression, he can not find the strength to love anyone else and scarcely himself; he is stuck in time.    John, like his father, is a protector; he is a cop searching for a solution to the Nightingale serial- murderer case, a case which connects both his mother, his father and ultimately himself.  Across the warped, phenomenal channels of time, Johnny is miraculously connected to his father via a ham radio, on a frequency spanning the thirty years distance between them. With John's knowledge of the events of time and working as a cop, can John save his father, protect his mother, bring his loving family together, and redeem himself?    As I watched the movie again, I heard something in the final scene I had not attended to before.  Johnny's dad, finally reunited with his family, is on third base, when he calls out to Johnny:  \\"Bring me home, chief.\\"  That did it for me.  I've always loved baseball as a metaphor for life.      \\"When You Come Back to Me Again,\\" sung by Garth Brooks in the final scene, is poignant and metaphorically helps depict Johnny's journey from a boy and man adrift at sea to a man guided by the lighthouse, and the powerful, transcending love between father and son, a restoring love, a love bringing John's family home safely- to shore.

0307346617|3.0|I'm a HUGE zombie fan.  Zombies rule.  This book chronicles a zombie war from the perspective of survivors from all over the world telling their stories by being interviewed by the \\"author\\".  And I found it to be just OK.  Some of the interviews are a little dry.  I found myself wanting to skip some of the interviews to see what the next one was going to be about.  However, some of the stories were fantastic.  I really liked the way it had perspectives from all over the world.  It also chronicled the start and ending of the war.  I like more suspense and scariness in my zombie tales.  Some stories had just that, but most did not.  And each interviewee seemed talk like all the others.  The author needed to change up the dialogue to cater to each person.  A person from Japan is not going to talk the way a person from South Africa speaks, even with translation.  It just fell a little flat for me.  I am interested to see how the movie version will be.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Objective Section:  With this album begins what many people consider the \\"classic\\" lineup of Iron Maiden, as then-newcomer Nicko Mcbrain joins the band as the new drummer (replacing the great Clive Burr). Piece of Mind is a great leap forward from the classic Number of the Beast in terms of songwriting dynamics, as the previously mentioned album was mostly written by the band's bassist and leader, Steve Harris. However, this album features more songwriting involvement from singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. Being an album mostly influenced by literature and film, there is more creative diversity that connects this album together (ranging from prophecies and mythology, to cavemen and \\"troopers\\"), as well as giving Iron Maiden an intelligent, thinking-man's edge (which must explain the cover of Eddie lobotomized and bound in a strained jacket and chains in a mental institution). If there are metalheads looking for something to head bang, and \\"think\\" along to, look no further than Iron Maiden's legendary 1983 classic, Piece of Mind.          Subjective Section:  Favorite album by Iron Maiden! I got the 1998 reissue as a 15th birthday present some years back, and remains one of my all-time favorite CDs. It holds a very proud place in my collection!
B003Y5H59W|5.0|I have been watching the previews & getting excited about this movie for a few months, and I finally got the chance to see it today with the company of my 7 year old daughter!    Due to the last several movies we have seen in 3d not being very impressive & the cost of 3d, we chose not to see the 3d version of the film.    Both my daughter & I really enjoyed this movie, and would gladly watch it again!!!    This movie is Fantasic & Works in many ways!  Chris Evans did an amazing job as the Captain, despite me previously hearing from others that he wouldnt work well, due to him being another super hero in The Fantastic Four movies.    Tommy Lee Jones was the same as he is in nearly all his other movies. He just makes his character stand out & he contributes to Evans mastery of his role.  All the actors in this film also do an excellent job in their respective roles.    I just love the fact that this movie was set in the time period it was set in.    My dad is not big movie guy & he hates to go to the theater, but because of the time period the movie was set in, I believe he would really enjoy & relate to this super hero movie, over some of the other ones.    The Villian, \\"the red skull\\" is the original villian of course for the Captain, and is the perfect advisary in this movie just like the comics.    The strong role & appearances of Stark really add Flare to the movie as well!  You will get a kick out of watching him, just being him!!!    This movie has plenty of action & flows at a steady pace, while also having some drama, some humor & you could say it has a bit of a love story as well.    I give this movie an A+  It isn't the best super hero movie ever, or the best one I have seen, but IT IS REAL & BELIEVABLE!!!  REAL & BELIEVABLE are the words that make the difference in this movie and really sell it!!!    Thanks for reading my review & I hope you enjoy this movie!!!  P.S. stay through the credits!!!

How many times can they keep reinventing the same car race & chase movies?  I liked the first four *okay*, they were entertaining enough, but this  one was much more refreshing than any of the other sequels  have been.  And don't  get me wrong, this is not  Oceans 14.  This is a tough-guy, fast-paced action heist  movie.  Maybe more like the Italian Job.

B003Y5H53S|3.0|I really thought  this would be more entertaining for my 5 year old, but nope.  This is one of those different, quirky kind of animated movies, most of humor is going to be over the head of small  children.  For the first 15 minutes or so I was really entertained, but then it started to get a little long and slow.  So slower pace and older  humor equals somewhat bored little kid.  The teens watching it were a little more entertained, though  I wouldn't say they loved it.  It's got really great voices, music and CGI. It's got some cool stuff in it, but I was a little bored for most of the movie too. I rented this  one, and I do  buy a lot of the  animated movies because the kids always re-watch when camping and stuff like that, but I really doubt this one would ever get watched again so I'll pass on buying it.

B0034G4P80|2.0|I expect more from the effects and CGI these  days, I really wasn't impressed at all with Thor in those areas.  My whole group thought the CGI Asgard was pretty lame looking, in fact.  The story was okay, but pretty simple.  It was also a bit long and boring.  Hemsworth seems to have some good style and charm but they didn't really give the character too much for him to showcase that.  The sidekick characters were all pretty boring.  Really, all of the other characters were pretty dull.  I saw this in the theater and really wasn't expecting a great movie, but I was still disappointed with it anyway.  I thought it would have quite a bit more  humor and excitement, I was wrong.  And it's not like it was this great, thought-provoking story either.  Nobody in my group liked  it, I probably was  the one with the best opinion of it.  Teens thought it was \\"lame\\" and 5 year old was just bored to death.  He's usually very good at sitting thru these types of movies too, but not this time, very antsy.  Unless you're really into the Thor character I suggest skip buying it and just  wait till cable.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's A Wonderful Life is a powerful film about the life and the value of family, friends, and community. The audience creates an emotional connection with all the characters, especially George Bailey. The protagonist and antagonist are clearly established in the beginning of the film and the audience wants the best for George Bailey, who stayed at his home town to run the family business, he loss of hearing as a child and eventually lost $8,000 to Mr. Potter. The acting by Jimmy Stewart is superb because his performance is realistic and it allows the audience to establish a connection with him. The music and cinematography also compliment the movie by setting joyous and somber mood. It's A Wonderful Life directed by Frank Capra is a classic and unparalleled film in communicating its message.

0553801473|2.0|This book has some good moments, but he really does need a good editor.<br /><br />At this point it's probably best to consider the 4th and 5th books as soap opera, not high fantasy.

This one is marginally better but should have been much better.<br /><br />Aaaah well, you're probably best borrowing it from the library if you must read it. Don't pay full price for it.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|I adored this film.  From the first impressionistic moments showing a multitude of  Parisian city scenes I was utterly sucked into the heart of this film where I remained for its entire duration, completely entranced.  The Woody Allen I have always loved is back, and for me, this is without question his finest film and his finest writing!  I attended university in the 1970's and was thoroughly steeped in the prose of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and others of their era.  I read them, read about them, and ended up with a familiarity that left me feeling as if  I had lived among them in that era myself.  Having also spent a year in France with much time in Paris, I have such nostalgia for that time in my life and what I experienced there as part of my own expat community of the time.  Hence my initial interest in this film, which did not disappoint on any level.  I have always liked Owen Wilson, but I do believe this is his finest performance to date.  He was perfect in every way, and best of all, he played the role of Gil exquisitely without being Woody Allen in disguise, quite a feat, actually.  Owen was himself, his performance was somewhat muted yet poignant, and this was his best role ever and one of which he should be proud.   The casting of Corey Stoll as Hemingway and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein in particular were standouts for me as the embodiments of how my youthful imagination envisioned those larger than life characters.  The fantasy aspect of the story in which Gil travels back through time to meet these characters is never an issue in believability, it simply \\"is\\".  Rather, the joy of the story is in the words of the various characters as they relate to each other, and Woody's script is beautifully and memorably written.  I enjoyed every moment of the film and did not want it to be over. It was such a joy to watch.
0123694965|5.0|I started writing games for the Apple App Store and some games did well in the market while others did not do as well.  I was really frustrated and I turned to professional game designers, other books, metric systems, friends, strangers, etc. to understand why.  I could hardly gain any insights.  I picked up this book and I was a little dismayed initially that there were no quick and easy answers.  As I went through the book, I got more and more excited as I discovered that Jesse was revealing the secret sauce behind successful games.  I've read the book three times now and I sometimes reread chapters on the Kindle.  In essence, there are many aspects to a game, starting from the story, the artwork, the technology, the interface, and the underlying mechanics.  These must each be right and in sync.  The user experience has to be fun. The game gives rise to this experience.  Every aspect of the game must serve to create and enhance this desired experience.  Jesse goes into incredible depth on what experiences players will enjoy and how to create each one.  There is a lot of content in here and it takes a long time to really understand each part.  Game design is still hard work but by following the principles here will enable you to know that the game you're creating is going to be really great.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was really disappointed in GRRM's latest effort. Dance with Dragons dragged on almost as bad as Feast for Crows. The plot of the Fire and Ice series makes little progress although many characters get fleshed out nicely. It is like buying a software upgrade that changes the menus to be clearer but does not advance the technology at all.<br />I liked the character development but now GRRM will make us wait five more years and maybe he will figure out how to tie all these tales together to move the plot along. Tommen may die on the Iron Throne of old age before we find out who can unseat him.<br />The series is almost like a soap in that you read about people dying and they pop back up alive in this book. Brandon Stark. Arya Stark, Theon Greyjoy, and a few others come back from the Â«deadÂ» in this one.
B000063UR1|5.0|The success in the real world of the Apollo moon landings, and the success in the cinema of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, led to science fiction suddenly becoming a very legitimate genre in Hollywood in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  New arenas and themes had opened up to replace the old clichés of B-grade aliens and bug-eyed monsters; now the focus was on films about the past, present, and future of mankind.  One such arena was Earth's own ecology, which, even as the 1970s began, was starting to show signs of being in trouble.  Such a fear would be translated onto film in 1971 by first-time director Douglas Trumbull, the genius special effects man behind a good deal of the success of 2001, in the deep-space ecological sci-fi film SILENT RUNNING, which became practically an instant cult classic upon its release in March 1972.    Set in a far distant future, where Earth's ecology has become a permanent train wreck, SILENT RUNNING generally takes place in the deepest and most isolated part of the Solar System onboard the American Airlines-sponsored deep-space freighter \\"Valley Forge\\", which houses three different types of what is left of Earth's greenery in geodesic domes, all of which are tended to by a very dedicated scientist (Bruce Dern).  But then comes the news that Valley Forge is being ordered back to Earth; and while that prospect pleases Dern's three human cohorts (Cliff Potts; Ron Rifkin; Jesse Vint), the fact that part of those orders also include nuking the geodesic domes and the remaining plant and animal life doesn't sit at all well with Dern.  With the help of two drone robots, Dern takes control of the 2000 foot-long freighter, leaving the one remaining domed example of Earth life attached to the main body of the ship, and putting the ship on a course that will take it around the planet Saturn and its glorious ring system and back to Earth.  Having jettisoned his human companions, who showed utter indifference to the conservation project from the beginning, he then instructs the drones in how to maintain these last remnants of Earth life.     Having achieved a lot as a special effects supervisor, first on 2001 and then on THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN in 1970-71, Trumbull managed to wangle his way into the director's chair for SILENT RUNNING, which was loosely based on an idea he himself had written a treatment for just after 2001 and which then was shaped into a screenplay by Deric Washburn, Mike Cimino (who later directed the 1978 Vietnam War epic THE DEER HUNTER), and Steven Bochco.  The elaborate nature of the story, dealing with futuristic ecology and conservation, would seem to have been hemmed in by the film's rather low budget of $1.2 million and a shooting schedule of just over a month; but Trumbull managed to pull this off by shooting all of SILENT RUNNING on location, both on the real-life, decommissioned aircraft carrier \\"Valley Forge\\" in Long Beach and at a hangar at Van Nuys Municipal Airport in the spring of 1971.  Trumbull also had the task, of course, of supervising the special effects, along with good friends Richard Yuricich and John Dykstra (both of whom he would reunite with on STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE), and, given the relative paucity of the budget, they still managed to work.  As this is also a character-driven piece, it is up to Dern to largely carry the film as the ambitious botanist; and while his penchant for vituperative acting erupts at times, he does a solid job of playing somebody who is not an over-the-top nutcase.  The presence of Joan Baez's songs alongside Peter Schickele's music score may be the one thing that dates SILENT RUNNING, but it doesn't date it too seriously.    Though only a moderate box office success, due to Universal's lackluster advertising campaign (or lack thereof), SILENT RUNNING remains a thoroughly interesting film, particularly as it presages certain elements of films like the 2006 eco-documentary AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH and even certain aspects of Disney's 2008 animated sci-fi opus WALL-E.  Even with decades of special effects advancement, especially with CGI, the effects in this film still stand up to a lot of scrutiny.  But more importantly, the message being told in SILENT RUNNING remains timely to this day, and it is an important one: We are capable of saving and preserving our planet if we have the will to; but if we don't, there will come a day when there won't be anything left.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|I have to admit, I love Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, even with it's bad acting and lack of realistic accents. This, along with the fact that I'm not a huge Crowe fan made me reluctant to see this movie. I was happily surprised! The story line was new and fresh, showing the beginnings of the legend.<br /><br />Acting is great, especially by Oscar Isaac, who plays Prince John. While I kept getting flashbacks to the Disney version of Prince John and expected him to at any moment stick his thumb in his mouth and cry for \\"Mummy!\\", Isaac really creates a creepy character that makes you squirm and long for his demise.<br /><br />Can't compare this to any other Robin Hood film/show - it stands on its own and is just as (if not more) entertaining.

I mean a \\"man cave\\"--actually I prefer a Bat-Cave.  He simplifies his fixes and the whole mars-venus thing is a laughable joke.  If you need good advice read a book by a qualified and accredited psychologist- not this quack.
1451629184|5.0|This is a book written by a survivor not a victim. She doesn't wallow in what she missed but embraces what she has. I was surprised by how balanced Jaycee is. Thankfully she doesn't go into graphic detail about sexual, physical, or verbal abuse she suffered. She gives you just enough to know how horrible it was for her and later her girls. I am curious about her girls, but she doesn't speak in great detail about. As any good parent would do she respects their privacy and wants to have a normal life. I would suggest keeping a box of tissues nearby. This is a heartbreaking book and one filled with hope. And I wish the best For Jaycee and her family.
0316017930|4.0|\\"Outliers\\" is a well researched and highly pleasurable book to read. Malcolm Gladwell's method is typically to tell the story of an immensely successful person two different ways -- first, following the \\"rags to riches\\" narrative line, in which a man (and usually it is a man) makes his way up the ladder of success exclusively by dint of his own talent and effort; second, by revealing \\"the rest of the story,\\" focusing on the historical context, specific circumstances, and unseen opportunity that made it possible for the ladder to exist at all. In pitting these two kinds of narratives against each other, Gladwell redresses an imbalance in how many Americans understand success and in the second half of the book points towards social interventions that might create opportunity for more people (for example, year-long school for underprivileged students who do not have access to enrichment programs during the summer).    All of this is very good, but the insight of the book is hardly as original as Gladwell makes it out to be. Only the most unsophisticated reader actually thought before starting \\"Outliers\\" that Bill Gates (a Harvard drop-out) was truly a self-made man or that a person's cultural background has no bearing on his ability to stand up to authority (although the analysis of Korean Air plane crashes does throw this problem of culture into almost unbearable relief). In fact, Gladwell only partly addresses the question that motivated him to write the book (\\"Well, I know lots of people who are really smart and really ambitious, and they aren't worth 60 billion dollars\\" [interview in afterword]). Even his own stories, as he acknowledges, only explain how a really successful individual got his shot, not why he had the gumption to take it, or why he rather than another person nailed that shot. The part of success that individuals have CONTROL over really isn't addressed in this book. It's also part of the book's story that opportunities are often almost impossible todiscern or to seize until their moment is past, making genuine productive social intervention nigh upon impossible.    It even turns out that Gladwell wanders into a bit of a contradiction when he talks about talent, intelligence, and persistence. One vignette in this book is not a success story, the one told in the chapter \\"The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 2.\\" Here we learn about Chris Langan, a quiz show star with an impossibly high IQ who never made it big because he didn't have the social and cultural capital to finish college. But Langan actually had opportunities; he was admitted to two different colleges; he made his way onto a national TV program; his ability was widely known in his community and recognized in his family. As Gladwell explains, he lacked the \\"practical intelligence\\" to make use of those opportunities. But we never learn that \\"practical intelligence\\" isn't a form of ability (just like IQ) that is only partly a feature of one's social and family situation. The fact that it isn't commonly measured doesn't mean that it isn't part of a person's inherent make up (as Gladwell himself admits, \\"It's something, at least in part, that's in your genes\\" [101]). Thus we are returned to the story of an individual and not just of the society that creates him.    In the end, this is a worthy book, a little over-argued but valid in its effort to emphasize the role that history and culture make in creating success. True to its argument that outliers are almost always more in the mainstream than they first appear, it is not the ground-breaking work it pretends at times to be.

0312430000|4.0|I had read Atul Gawande's complications and liked his writing. And then came The Checklist Manifesto. I was intrigued - because in the business I was in at the time - conduct of examinations - the checklist is THE most important tool. Picked it up wondering what a surgeon is doing with checklists.<br /><br />Extremely interesting book - from construction to airlines, Atul explains that successful output in very complex systems involving several people and several machines is a function of having a checklist and ensuring every line item is ticked off. For instance, on a flight, when the pilot and co-pilot are taking-off they actually tick off a check list that is on the screen in front of them. This ensures the ability of complex systems to perform predictably and perform well.<br /><br />He then compares the airline pilot and the construction project manager with surgery and realizes that in surgery - a very complicated system that requires several people and several machines to work well and predictably - there are no checklists. So he introduces it and records the change in performance.<br /><br />The author reinforces the wisdom that is often manifested in organizations - that excellence is achieved through a combination of competence and extraordinary diligence. But in complex systems everyone is already competent which is why they are there. So there is a need to focus on extraordinary diligence - and checklists are a tool. \\"

B004XWLN20|4.0|One of the best Tv shows adapted from a comic book series, and definitely the best TV adaptation of Superman. Honestly, I'd love to get this set, high price aside (ten seasons plus bonuses, what do you expect, right?). Anyway the one problems is there is no blu-ray set because WB refuses to release seasons 1-5 on blu-ray because fro their money they can't \\"get blu-ray quality hi-def on them\\" which is stupid because I've seen some pretty crappy conversions being released on blu-ray so i don't see the point that they're trying to mak.e, not tomention if the set gets released on blu-ray, many people will buy it. Normally wouldn't care if I got it just on dvd but with the effects put into the show make it well worth getting it on blu-ray. It looks like a great set, I'm tempted to get it but I think I'll hold out a little longer to see if they do release it to blu-ray

B004XQO90E|4.0|Source Code (Thriller, Sci-Fi)<br />Directed by Duncan Jones<br />Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Vera Farmiga, Michelle Monaghan and Jeffrey Wright<br /><br />Summit Entertainment   2011   93 min   Rated PG-13   Released Jul 26, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Bonus View (PiP)<br /><br />The Movie 4/5<br /><br />Director Duncan Jones has had an impressive start to his career. Moon (2009) saw Sam Rockwell turn in a very good performance and Source Code has built on that success. Jones has attracted a wonderful cast and the $32 million budget allows for a more spectacular presentation. Moon reminded me of older classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, but Source Code feels like a modern story.<br /><br />The movie is a thriller with a strong science fiction element, but it also plays like a mystery. The opening scene shows Captain Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) on a train in Chicago. When he sees his reflection in the window of the train, it's not him. Christina (Monaghan), the woman in the opposite seat, calls him Sean. A few minutes later we see the train explode and Stevens wakes up alone in a chamber of some kind.<br /><br />Jones shows us everything from the viewpoint of Stevens, so we only gradually come to understand the situation. Stevens is part of an experimental project which enables him to inhabit the body of somebody else. The project is led by Dr. Rutledge (Wright) and Colleen Goodwin (Farmiga).<br /><br />They can only communicate with Stevens by using a camera and a computer screen. He's told that he must find out where the bomb is and uncover the person responsible for planting it. He can't avoid the explosion, but the information could prevent a future disaster involving the bomber. He can only inhabit the body of Sean for eight minutes at a time. So we see Stevens trying to gather information. Each time the train explodes, the pattern resets and he tries again. It's like a blend of Groundhog Day and Quantum Leap.<br /><br />We have a race against the clock to prevent further terrorism and that keeps us on the edge of our seats. There's also the chance of romance between Sean and Christina, as well as great special effects. Comedian Russell Peters provides most of the comic relief. This package has plenty to keep us hooked. At the outset I expected one of the twists to be that Sean turns out to be the bomber, but I was wrong. Couldn't Stevens simply take over the body of the bomber on his next visit once he found out who it was, or does the technology only allow you to access people who are \\"compatible\\" with you?<br /><br />Put yourself in that position for a moment. If you were a train passenger tasked with uncovering the identity of a bomber, how would you proceed? Would you be polite to total strangers as you questioned them? How about contacting the guard and explaining the situation? Whatever course of action you choose, the train will explode in eight minutes (unless you locate and disarm the bomb). That allows Jones to break the established rules somewhat. If the pattern resets each time, he can do anything. Sean can be rude, engage in criminal activity, or follow incredibly dangerous courses of action. He could even kill or be killed. That makes the movie less predictable than most.<br /><br />I won't reveal what does happen, but hopefully I've described the situation well enough for you to know whether you'll like the movie.<br /><br />The movie raises some serious themes such as how the line between right and wrong can become blurred. In a sense it also deals with the issue of slavery, just as Moon did.<br /><br />Jones has produced another interesting idea and turned it into a thrilling story. The four main actors turned in good performances and the whole thing worked well for me. I'm a fan of the whole Groundhog Day concept and enjoy Run Lola Run for the same reason. There have also been episodes of The X-Files and Star Trek Next Generation dealing with the same concept.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />I detected slight aliasing on a couple of overhead shots of the city, but it's only there for a second or two.

Even if you don't follow every line of the complicated language,  because of the exceptional acting and directing you don't get lost.  More people would love high art is they could experience such accessible productions.  I wish Branagh would go for King Lear next.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Firstly, let me say that I'm reading these books in order, so this was only my 2nd Jack Reacher novel. I loved \\"Killing Floor\\". It was fast paced & kept me interested from start to finish. But I found \\"Die Trying\\" a pretty hard slog. I loved the first 100 pages, but after that it just dragged. It could have been 150 pages shorter, and would have been better. Too much detail in relation to firearms, bullets, trajectories, geography & physics. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in those things & know a bit about them from my own career, but I felt like the author just continued to put in detailed paragraphs about those things, which got incredibly repetitive and tedious. I will read the 3rd novel in the series, as I love Jack Reacher & the implausibility of what befalls him. But I hope it's more like \\"Killing Floor\\" than \\"Die Trying\\".

1594481717|2.0|A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future, by Daniel H. Pink is a text which examines why right brainers or people with more creative and artistic abilities are going to rule the future. His argument is that due to Abundace, Asia and Automation, Left-Brained people or people with technical abilities are going to loose their edge in the job market. The only solution for them to remain relevant is to pick up skills which are more artistic and creative to enhance their skill set and to be more creative/empathetic in their approach to problems and work.     The book definitely raises an interesting point of view and a lot of the things which are mentioned are relevant. Interpersonal skills are becoming more and more relevant in workplace. Social networks are dominating a lot of chatter, which implies communicating more and more (without seeing the person ofcourse!). A lot of technical solutions require creative inputs and cannot be solved without them. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these recommendations and solutions. I agree with the issues pointed out by the author which a lot of Left-Brained people suffer from. Disclaimer: I am in the technical field, and at the same time do understand the importance of right brained based creativity in the work place. But I decided to give 2 stars to the book.     My issue with the book are the following   (a) The book reads like, Daniel Pink woke up one day in the morning and decided Left-Brains are not good enough. It almost sounds like a tirade which is highly biased with one side of the coin. He makes examples (book was published in 2006) that there are softwares which will start generating softwares. Thus, software engineer will loose relevance. I work in Software Industry and I can assure him, as of now, the software he has mentioned in the book has not been used in any serious industrial scenarios. Watson which appeared on Jeopardy a few months ago and won, was a creation by a team of Mathematicians and Computer Scientists who were extremely good in their skills. Yes, I feel sad too, at the victory, since humans lost. But at the end of the day, Watson was created by a bunch of humans.     (b) His tirade against work shipped to Asia sounds like he is lobbying to the US Senators for curtailing work being shipped overseas. Yes, I am a foreign national (Indian Citizen) in US. But my opinion has nothing to do with that. Has Mr.Pink analyzed the kind of work which is being shipped overseas? US has its edge in R&D in the Tech Industry and it still holds that. Even if its loosing that edge, its not just because Asia produces more Computer Engineers who work for a fraction of the salary. Its also because unfortunately over here, if you enjoy Math and Science, people label you as a Geek/Nerd and you are the laughing stock of the school. Asia is rising in R&D, but still the number of patents and research papers which US produces is way higher than India. Have you looked at the surveys of salaries? Lemme present it to you, Source: [...] This is 2011. 5 years, after this specific edition of the book was published.     (c) He recommends fulfillment in life. Adopting a holistic approach to looking at things. Sure, nothing wrong with that too. He mentions getting married to lead a more happy and fulfilled life. A lot of people find meaning in their life in solitude. Mr.Pink please feel free to search on Amazon, and you will find numerous books with the same assertion some of which have been written by people who teach mindfulness for a living. You talk about giving up materialistic things in the end of the book. Towards the beginning you advocate why I should buy a 15$ toilet brush from Target which was created by a designer. Its going to make me feel better? Isn't that materialistic? Buy designer Patio furniture not normal stuff. See the apparent contradiction?       I can write a much longer review examining the apparent contradictions in the beliefs of the book. I am not debating against the theme of the book. Yes, it is important to have creative skills, but the book is full of opinions which to a larger extend lack basis. Yes, he gives his brain scans, but those are facts. I don't understand how the people who recommended this book including Thomas Friedman says, this is the best book for economics he has read. Really Mr.Friedman?????
B0052UZIFA|4.0|played this on Google Chrome browser and loved it. I love it even more as a free app in my DX.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I seriously suggest that you watch Let the Right One In first.<br /><br />All of the subtle overtones, motivation and beautiful cinematography is captured by the original.  For nearly identical scripts and dialogue, both movies get things right... and wrong.<br /><br />I like the pacing of Let Me In much better, however the US version is so much more superficial and melodramatic than the original.  Let Me In is a great movie, but it's very Americanized.  Eli in Let the Right One In is manipulative, in Let Me In she is portrayed more innocently.  The father becomes detached and pretty much commits suicide due to jealousy of Eli and the young boy, an undertone pretty much missing from the remake.  Also, the story dealing with the woman who turns into a vampire is much more meaningful in the original... In Let Me In, she is quickly killed off.  Let the Right One In explores her becoming, and her eventual suggested suicide.  The scene where she is attacked by cats in the original never made it to Let Me In, and that scene was fantastic, but it really didn't do much for the original plot line.  It did help portray what happens when one becomes a vampire, so in this aspect, removing this story from Let Me In detracts it from being the pure vampire movie everyone says it is.  The original is much better at this than Let Me In.<br /><br />I honestly like both movies about the same for very different reasons.  They're both keepers and it's amazing that a remake so recently done after the original could be so successful.
B004YM67TI|2.0|When your entire plot hinges on a single instance that happened in the midst of a forest a decade ago, and may or may not have been witnessed by the person who needs to have seen it, you should really rethink your story. Too bad the makers of \\"Red Riding Hood\\" didn't think of that.<br />A werewolf take on the fairytale has the potential to be very interesting. As it was, the central mystery in this film was executed well, and was intriguing. Unfortunately, the characters were rigid and lifeless; the romantic conflict was tepid and forced; and the story segments were obvious and uninspired. Far too often, this film felt like a brief overview of character-types or personality types rather than people; we didn't get to know the people, we only saw that they behaved, rather unconvincingly, in some way. This was true for most characters - including the two male love interests, both of whom came across as fill-ins for character types rather than actual characters - as well as most of the human interactions. What we saw of Red Riding Hood and Peter's romance seemed an effort to convince us by how cutsie they were that they were in love. Character development, too, followed in this vein of showing rather than becoming. The boys pouted; Red Riding Hood's eyes widened; the witch hunter glared; etc. Perhaps the best actors were the supporting actors, the villagers and the witch hunter's companions, who seemed to be rather than just pretend to be who they were.<br />Factor in that the mysterious identity hinges on (spoiler) someone witnessing the death of a rabbit a decade ago (end spoiler), and we really reach the final nail in the coffin of this film's potential. There's a lot of could have, should have, possibly would have about this movie...unfortunately, there is little right that was done with the film.<br /><br />2/5 for this stinker ... because I'm in a generous mood
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Yes, you read my title and rating right.<br /><br />Sucker Punch is probably the most visually appealing bad movie ever made.<br /><br />I see where the director was trying to take the story.  I understand what he was trying to do.  He failed.  Miserably.  Beautifully.  The pretentious dialogue, which would have detracted from a really great movie, at the end was even the icing on the cake and was the final cringe before the credits rolled.<br /><br />Personally, the movie would have been much better if the girls had been wearing skimpier clothing.  They were far too covered up and in the end, detracted what could have been an interesting suspenseful T&A movie.  It fails.<br /><br />Disjointed fantasies could have worked if they were tied together with some plot more than \\"we need a map, fire, a key, a knife and some really good drugs so we can make it all work.\\"  Sadly, it doesn't.<br /><br />Baby Doll is such an amazing dancer, everyone sees her fantasy.  Except that we never see her dance.  Not even at the end.  Perhaps white girl can't really dance?  Who would have known.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is no extreme in this movie except for extreme CGI.  It could have been really good.  Unfortunately all it really becomes is a teenaged JO movie that was too afraid to go in any direction and holds itself back at every turn... that it had none.<br /><br />The beauty of the movie is lost from direction and scriptwriting that was too afraid to push it away from a PG-13 rating.  I never saw the theatrical cut and after watching the extended cut, I never want to.  All I know is that this movie tops the hall of shame and is ideal to present to friends when there is nothing better to watch and want to cringe on how beautiful a horrible movie really can be.<br /><br />I wish the director would have sat down and watched a few truly disturbing movies and decided to take it off the worn path.<br /><br />For what it's worth, Terry Gilliam's Tideland is one of my favorite movies.  At least Gilliam was able to push the movie in a direction that none other have gone and wasn't afraid to do it.  Sucker Punch could have been one of those movies that everyone will remember.  Instead, it'll fit nicely on someone's shelf next to the remake of Willy Wonka and be soon forgotten.tion that none other have gone and wasn't afraid to do it.

B004EPYZPI|5.0|In a nutshell, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" story is: A slick lawyer skilled at getting small time perps out of trouble lands a high paying gig and, possibly for the first time, a potentially innocent client; things get interesting when he must figure out which of his clients is guilty, and who - the guy already serving time, or the guy who is likely to serve time - really is the criminal, and how to keep or get the other one out of prison.<br /><br />It's the sort of story with a lot of potential, and this film doesn't let down. Matthew McConaughey (the slick lawyer) is at ease in the role, and transitions from easy-going and slick to worried and revengeful when the time is right. The rest of the cast is likewise excellent in their roles. The story is clever and intriguing, and progresses at an ideal pace - not too fast to lose you, but not so slow that you're bored.<br /><br />5/5 stars, for a fun, interesting legal thriller
B000OQF6N6|5.0|If you own the Red Zeitgeist (the original release) you are missing out on some great material. I partially enjoyed Zeitgeist when I got it as it was first released, but when I picked up the silver version I was much more into the record.     The three songs, \\"Death From Above\\", \\"Ma Belle\\", and \\"Stellar\\" are great tracks. I wish they would have included the song \\"Zeitgeist\\" on this album.     Sometimes those three extra tracks are the only ones I listen to. They are great!
B004A8ZX2I|3.0|(Mild spoilers, nothing worse than what you'd see in the trailers)<br />What happens when you wake up from a coma with a handful of memories, no idea how you ended up where you are, and a life that's been hijacked by someone else? Such is the predicament of Dr. Martin Harris in the film \\"Unknown\\", as he sets about piecing together what happened and, most mystifying of all, why his wife denies any knowledge of him and is with another man who claims to be Dr. Martin Harris.<br />(end spoilers)<br /><br />The film answers that question in a generally interesting and exciting way. There are significantly less than believable moments in this film (like the speed in which Liam Neeson can go from being in the middle of a shower to dressed and in hiding, when he realizes he's being hunted; or the super genius who, apparently, doesn't back up or keep a second copy of his world-altering-research; etc.). There are questions that really aren't answered (like how the super genius' passwords were obtained in the first place). There are also funny and intriguing moments, and likeable characters (at least, so you think...). This is not a unique film - the plot is, in many respects, very similar to another film in the same genre. It is, however, a fairly decent one; nothing about it is inspired, but it is definitely worth a watch.<br /><br />3/5 stars, for a solid, if not fascinating, film.
076115678X|4.0|I have cherub curls that will straighten into waves if the air is dry, and frizz like an ungroomed poodle if it's humid. I've tried a number of things in this book, and they have worked for me, but not everything has. For example, it talks about it taking a few weeks for your curl pattern to set in. Because my hair is so delicate, I don't exactly have one. I'm a little surprised that any cherub curl gal does, actually. If they do, I'd love to find out what they're doing, because what's going on here doesn't entirely work. The book definitely seems to be geared more towards thicker-haired folks. That said, some of the suggestions (quinoa scalp scrub, lavender spray, etc.) have been excellent and very helpful.    Overall, I think it's a great investment for a curly-headed gal or guy. Just go into it with your eyes open.
B003Y5H5A6|5.0|\\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" is right up there with 2008's Iron Man (and might even surpass it) as Marvel's best movie and it may well be one of the best superhero films ever. There is something about the superhero film that makes it a special genre in my heart and I am in love with the mythology of these characters. This is my first review on Amazon and I normally wouldn't go through the time to write a review but this movie is worth it. You all know the plot synopsis, so I won't repeat it here. But it is absolutely safe to say that this an excellent, fun, and amazing movie. First off, the cast is top-notch and, as Chris Evans (who is without a doubt the best of the bunch) said in a recent interview, \\"there is literally not a weak link in the chain\\". As I stated above, Chris Evans really shines, no, EXPLODES, in his role as Steve Rogers/ Captain America. I have never seen an actor embody a superhero role as greatly as Chris does. If there is one thing Marvel Studios has gotten pitch perfect in all of their films, it is the character development and casting of its lead actors, from Robert Downey Jr. who made Tony Stark one of the greatest film characters of all time to Chris Hemsworth who came out of nowhere and made the role of Thor really stand out as he embodied that character. But this isn't a review for those films, this is a review for Captain America and Evans has succeeded on all levels. I, and just about everyone else in the audience in my packed theater, fell in love with his character from when he first started out as \\"skinny Steve\\" (through the use of some pretty impressive special effects) to after the Super Soldier transformation. You can really identify with him and you can feel empathy towards his actions and his personality. Suffice to say, he has made Captain America my personal favorite superhero.   The other cast members are amazing as well. Hayley Atwell really makes a splash as British SSR officer Peggy Carter and the romance that develops between her and Steve is both believable and heartwarming. Every superhero movie has to have romance in it (it is a staple of the genre, after all) and the romance in this movie is one of the genre's best, not to mention Agent Carter is a kick-ass, strong-willed character who Atwell portrays pitch perfectly. Hugo Weaving as Cap's nemesis Johann Schmidt/ The Red Skull is both menacing (thanks to some cool and pretty impressive make-up effects) and downright evil. He stands out in all the scenes he's in and you really couldn't imagine a more perfect choice for Cap's arch enemy as Hugo portrays the character with a great German accent perfectly. That's a word that I associate with this movie a lot: perfect. I have come to believe that the word does not exist and has no meaning to it but I feel that this movie is as close as it could get to fulfiiling my expectations and more.   Now the other supporting cast members are scene-stealers in their own right. Sebastian Stan is a great friend and a great sidekick to Cap and he really does a fantastic job in his role. He isn't in the movie enough, but when he is, you can't help but like his character. His performance gets me really excited for the ensured sequels where he returns as the Winter Soldier. Other supporting cast members include Tommy Lee Jones as Col. Chester Phillips who provides a lot of great humor and good ol' American behavior as arguably the number one scene stealer and Stanley Tucci puts his best German accent to good use as the relatable and caring Dr. Abraham Erskine, who creates the Super Soldier serum. Dominic Cooper makes the role of Howard Stark is own by playing the character his own personal way and not mirroring RDJ's performance. Lastly is Toby Jones as The Red Skull's assisstant and a classic Captain America villain in his own right, Arnim Zola, who I hope to see more of in future Cap movies as well, as he gives a great performance in the movie.   Now on to the action sequences. There are fourmajor action sequences in the movie (the Heinz Krueger chase through Brooklyn, the HYDRA factory rescue mission, the high-speed train sequence, and the finale at Schmidt's HYDRA base and in the air on the giant Valkyrie warship which is by far the best, and not to mention the cool montage of Captain America and the Howling Commandoes taking out all of the HYDRA bases). Joe Johnston, the director who I am finally complementing for his superb job, stages these action sequences in a nostalgic, old-fashioned way that ironically is a breath of fresh air in today's virtual Hollywood blockbuster industry. He really was the best choice to direct this movie, as his special effects work on movies such as the Star Wars series and \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", both of which are paid homage to in this movie, as well as his period movies \\"The Rocketeer\\" and \\"October Sky\\" have prepared him to make this movie. Speaking of period pieces.....  The best part to me personally about this whole movie was the production design and the cinematography. The 1940's setting is absolutely amazing and it really stands out with the coloring of the browns in Brooklyn, the grays in Europe, and the red, white, and blue of Captain America's costume. You really feel as if you are being transported to that time period and I can only hope that \\"Captain America 2\\" has flashbacks to this timeless decade. I mean, really, the period setting and filming style of this film was just knocked out of the park. The bookend scenes in the present day were done well too, especially the ending scene when Steve finds himself in modern day Times Square, New York City. This was just such a cool contrast to the rest of the movie, which may sound like a detriment to the film but it was really well done and I liked it.  In closing, I give no higher honor than to a movie like \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" as being my first movie review. This film was old-fashioned, exhilariting, beautiful, was filled with fine performances (especially by Chris Evans who deserves all the praise he will recieve), and was one of the most amazing superhero films I have ever seen. Steve Rogers is an inspiring character and Alan Silvestri's patriotic score that plays over the credits gives support to this and to an awesome film-going experience. I have signed up to be notified when this movie is released on home video as I would love to add it to my own personal collection. I also look forward to seeing more of Evans as Steve (my new favorite superhero) in next year's \\"The Avengers\\" (that trailer looked awesome, by the way) and in the inevitable \\"Captain America\\" sequels. Heroes Are Made In America!
B000BYA4JM|5.0|I purchased the &#34;Who's That Girl&#34; soundtrack at my local music store in 1998, but, unfortunately, I wore the CD down throughout the years from excessive play. I then ordered a new copy again in 2008. Meanwhile, after years of waiting for a proper DVD release, I finally ordered the movie in '09. And as far as the CD itself, well, after the disastrous condition of my last copy, I will gladly admit, I have now learned my lesson when it comes to my precious Madonna memorabilia. These days, every time I go to reach for and/or play my favorite soundtrack, I make certain to use serious caution. Make no mistake, I still play the hell out of it, but when it comes to myself and a Madonna album, there's just no limit. The &#34;Who's That Girl&#34; movie is one of the most underappreciated movies ever made by Madonna, which, to this day, leaves me flabbergasted! The critics in 1987 ate this movie up for breakfast, constantly bad-mouthing Madonna's performance and her acting abilities in general. The very thought of critics AND fans blasting this film really annoys me! Both the album and the soundtrack hold a high level of importance in my life, so there's serious sedimental value on my part. Apparently, people can't seem to understand that the movie was MEANT to be a campy-like romantic comedy. Those who GET Madonna, GET IT, PERIOD! As an admirer of the film, I understand her comedic indication, as well as the films' intended nature. Therefore, Madonna arose to the occasion, because when it comes right down to it, &#34;Who's That Girl&#34; delivers everything it sets out to—excitement, love/romance, drama, comedy, and high-risk, on-the-edge, jam-packed action, all of which equals out to 94 minutes of amusing, enjoyable, praiseworthy entertainment!<br /><br />Who's That Girl<br /><br />The time has come for Nicole &#34;Nikki&#34; Finn's release from the Rockford Correctional Facility. After spending 4 years in Prison for being falsely-accused of murder, Nikki Finn (Madonna) is granted parole for good behavior. The parole guidelines are simple: Upon release, Nikki must report to the local Bus Station and return home to Philadelphia. With her chain-linked key (belonging to a safety-deposit box full of incriminating photos and tapes), and risqu&eacute; attire (a short black leather mini skirt, white tight tank top, 6 inch black pumps, and, of course her fire engine red lipstick), Nikki prepares to walk out the Prison a free Woman. Meanwhile, across town, Simon Worthington (John McMartin), a big shot, white-collar embezzler, gets news of Nikki's premature release from Prison, and immediately sets a plan in action, 'Operation Prisoner Shuttle.' In an attempt to conceal his role in the murder of Nikki's sweetheart, Johnny, Mr. Worthington recruits his son-in-law, tax attorney Loudon Trott (Griffin Dunne) to be Nikki's personal chauffeur, assuring Nikki's arrival to the Bus Station and off to Philadelphia. No sooner than departing from lockdown, Nikki is greeted by Mr. Trott. With time looming, and a fussy pet Cougar waiting in the wings, Loudon sets out to complete 2 errands that were asked of him: 1, see to it that the valuable endangered cougar, Murray, arrives safely to it's rightful owner, Montgomery Bell (Sir John Mills), and 2, make sure to see Nikki off to Philadelphia. But Nikki has other plans, and wastes no time picking up where she left off prior to incarceration. In an effort to avenge her innocence, and bring the 2 hit-men responsible for her lovers' timely death to justice, Nikki takes full control, sending Trott and the Cougar spiraling down a path of rampage and destruction. Insanity ensues. From shoplifting, to a near-death experience caused by a train, to a heart attack scare, and a police chase, Loudon quickly realizes that he isn't in Scarsdale anymore. After the purchase of a firearm in Harlem NY, and a stealthy stake-out, Nikki reunites herself with Raoul (Coati Mundi) and his over-sized goon Benny (Dennis Burkely), the 2 crooks who are set on keeping Nikki from clearing her name. The movie elevates with an oversufficient quantity of good ol' rock 'um sock 'um entertainment, all leading up to a romantic finale.<br /><br />Madonna's contribution to the Motion Picture Soundtrack<br /><br />During the filming of Who's That Girl, Madonna went to work simultaneously on the movie's soundtrack. The album spawned 2 chart-topping hits for her, thus dubbing the album as another 'Madonna' project. The first song released for promotion was &#34;Who's That Girl.&#34; This song sets sail tide-high, drifting along with it's bongo-beating, caribbean-esque, airy flow. In my opinion, this is one of Madonna's most passion-driven rhythmic songs to date, and my absolute favorite sentimental song ever sang/created by her (Live to Tell is my 2nd, Oh Father is 3rd, and The Look of Love stands at 4th). Next, the second song on the soundtrack, &#34;Causing a Commotion,&#34; which begins with a triple bang of drum/beat/bass, and has more of a hyperactive flow. The blender-shaken style of the instruments makes for a perfect dance hit! I fondly remember when this song made it's debut on Soul Train; a Saturday morning dance show, in '87. Causing a Commotion's jump from MTV airwaves to a predominantly African American dance show truly proves just how gifted this woman really is, and the level of universal appeal that she, a trailblazer, can obtain. Third, &#34;The Look of Love.&#34; One could easily fall into a trance due to the calm, slow, fuzzy, wildlife-sounding aura from this ballad. Madonna begins with a casual, yet remorseful, tone, while every now and again, raising her voice to get her point across. Every note hits your core repeatedly, and sends a tranquil sensation throughout your mind, body and soul. And lastly, the 4th addition to the album, &#34;Can't Stop,&#34; fully provided with a mid-pace rhythm and a whirling, robotic-talking synth. The message is direct and very clear, with 100% conviction. There is intrigue in Madonna's vocals as she exclaims: &#34;I've tried and tried to get next to you, my friends say I am blind I'll never break through.&#34; Then, boldly, &#34;But I don't give in so easily, this I know, you just wait and see.&#34; And later howls out, &#34;Don't be afraid to try, just let me love you for awhile.&#34; Madonna admits that she simply cannot stop thinking about her beau, and is determined to express just how difficult it is for her to refrain from &#34;screaming&#34; and &#34;shouting&#34; his name ever so often.<br /><br />The personal impact this movie and song have made on me<br /><br />The movie starts out with a cartoon figure of Madonna's character, Nikki Finn, introducing the film credits. The animation, song, music video and film were all inspirational to me, and played a critical role in my childhood. I was only going on 6 years old during that year, and MTV was everything, absolutely everything! And let me just say, at 6 years old, in the '80s, music videos seemed to be huge pieces of million dollar artwork in motion. Well, the Summer of 1987 was when I first viewed the music video for &#34;Who's That Girl.&#34; I was awestruck! I recall dancing around a lot, laughing, chanting the chorus section of the song in sync with Madonna, staring in amazement at the movie clips intertwined. But, the one thing that stood out above all else was the stylish animation of the character, Nikki Finn. The image of that cartoon would be my motivational fuel throughout the remainder of the '80s and well into the '90s. Basically, the fashionable illustration is why I later became interested in drawing/sketching/designing! I have been drawing since Elementary, sketching throughout Jr. High, won a few awards in High School for drawing and designing, then became interested in fashion and designing in 10th grade. In my heart, I know that I wouldn't have half of the success that I have without Who's That Girl, and I owe a fraction of my mild success to Ms. Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone! I have the utmost respect her, and I honor her for sparking that artistic talent that I always knew I had, hidden from within.<br /><br />In Conclusion<br /><br />What ended up being a critical and commercial failure, has now turned into a cult classic. And even though the soundtrack excelled and enjoyed universal success, it's safe to guarantee that both the film and album do pretty well in sales today. Madonna has come quite far in the music/entertainment business, and she isn't budging any time soon. The very first time I laid eyes on her was in Desperately Seeking Susan, in 1985, and then in her &#34;Lucky Star&#34; and &#34;Material Girl&#34; music videos. Back then, MTV aired music videos in rotation, sometimes airing blocks of Madonna videos, in which, at that point, were an accumulation of work from 1983-1985. I was starstruck back then, and every time I witness another shift in her work, I become starstruck all over again. Madonna has remained triumphant, creating evident highlights of achievement, including selling more than 300 million albums, numerous awards, including a Golden Globe for her role in Evita, her induction into the 2008 Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, all in conjunction with a colossal extent of charitable work. The list continues for this Mother of 3, but there's not much more room to continue on with her achievements. She's congenial; she's provocative; she's outrageous—and over the years, we've all been witness to her evolution—from street-smart girlfriend, to virgin bride, a pornographic sex goddess, to a Yogi! Her mind is as celebrated equally as her body; she's as feared as she's desired; she leads while other's follow—a woman who set out to conquer and &#34;rule the world!&#34; ...my opinion? - Mission complete!she exclaims: &#34;I've tried and tried to get next to you, my friends say I am blind I'll never break through.&#34; Then, boldly, &#34;But I don't give in so easily, this I know, you just wait and see.&#34; And later howls out, &#34;Don't be afraid to try, just let me love you for awhile.&#34; Madonna admits that she simply cannot stop thinking about her beau, and is determined to express just how difficult it is for her to refrain from &#34;screaming&#34; and &#34;shouting&#34; his name ever so often.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|This may be what happens when someone is paid for past performances. Like an aging athlete that once was hero to millions. Those heroes  are  now paid more for the memories. The book had a disjointed and forced feel to it. Characters and scenes were fluff to fill out the book.  The ramblings were reminiscent of the stories told by a lonely senior citizen. Good stories but often inappropriate.
0439023521|4.0|Hunger Games was a book that had been sitting on my bookshelf for the last few months unread. I finally decided to read it yesterday. It is a very easy book to finish in a few hours. I did enjoy the book but I just felt the whole time I was looking for more details and descriptions. However I will continue to read the series since it is an entertaining book.
B004RC8NUQ|4.0|I'm a hugh fan of Natalie Portman. Drop dead gorgeous, talented, and a Mensa I.Q. She's a hell of a combination.<br />As for \\"No Strings Attached\\", this movie has all of the earmarks of a light-weight romantic comedy and OK, it is.<br />Still, I confess that I thought it was pretty good. Even if your not a Natalie Portman fan, and they grow ever fewer,<br />the younger crowd of twenty-somethings will probably enjoy this one. Four starts for the movie, five for Natalie.<br />Presented in 16:9 format, I believe. The picture and sound quality were both excellent.
B003EYVXUU|2.0|When Let Me In was announced, there was backlash from fans of the original Swedish film Let the Right One In, given that the original film had just came out. It's par for the course for a foreign film to be remade so soon after its release nowadays, but director /writer Matt Reeves assured them that this would not be a typical remake. Instead, he promised that this would be a different take on the original novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  He had also told Lindqvist in a private conversation that he had no intention of copying the Swedish film but had fallen in love with the novel and wanted to use that. Given that the novel is significantly different from the original film, there was plenty of new material that Reeves could have chose from. For example, the character of Hakan in the novel is considerably more disturbing than anything the Swedish film showed.<br /><br />While I can't say if Reeves' film changed since he made those original comments, anyone familiar with both the novel and the Swedish film will know that this film is very much a straight up remake of the film. It follows the Swedish screenplay beat for beat, right down to elements in the Swedish film that weren't even in the original novel. There are some differences (a car crash sequence being the biggest one) but for the most part this is Tomas Alfredson's original film with minor cosmetic changes. Given how great the novel is, it's a shame that Reeves took the easy way out as opposed to looking at the original source material with fresh eyes and giving us something different. Maybe a more faithful adaptation would still have been weaker, but at least Reeves could say with honesty that he put his own stamp on the story as opposed to copying what had gone on before him.<br /><br />The film itself pretty much follows the criteria that most American remakes of foreign horror films follow nowadays (and yes, I know that it's from a British studio). I'll give Reeves credit for not making the kids high schoolers and for trying to make a  horror film for adults, but at the same time, any serious director must know that making this Twilight would be tantamount to shooting yourself in the head. So let's check go through the checklist:<br /><br />1. More violence and gore? Check. Most of the violence in the original film was restrained, here everything is cranked up to eleven. At times it's almost ridiculous. I could list numerous examples but I'd end up recapping the whole film, so one will stand for all: the finale. The original's finale is almost beautiful despite its horrific content; here, everything is loud, messy and chaotic and wouldn't seem out of place in any other horror film.<br /><br />2. Simplified plot? Check. Reeves does away with most of the supporting cast and subplots in the Swedish film. For some viewers, this has been a positive, but I felt it took away from the depth of the story. In the original film, much of the victims came across as real people and made the film more tragic. Here, they're walking blood bags and little else.<br /><br />3. Less ambiguity? Check. There's a lot of mystery in the Swedish film. You were left to draw your own conclusions. Here, Reeves spells everything out for the audience. The funny thing is, the original film really isn't that hard to follow or understand, so all the 'explaining' comes off as a lack of respect for the audience's intelligence. It's not as if the Swedish film was Synecdoche, New York.<br /><br />4. Cleaning up 'objectionable' content? Check. This is hard to explain without spoiling it, but if you've seen the Swedish film you know what I'm talking about. There's a disturbing scene that puts the entire film into a different perspective, and deals with a theme that many are uncomfortable with. Predictably (seriously, did anyone think that was going to be in this?), it's been removed.<br /><br />All in all, I really can't recommend this. At best, the film is competently made and has some decent performances. But if you've seen the Swedish film, this really doesn't offer anything different or worthwhile. It's more or less the same film, just simplified, 'cleaned up' and made gorier for mainstream audiences. If you haven't seen the Swedish film, then drop what you are doing and watch that now. If you don't want to watch the Swedish film because it's subtitled, then I'm sorry that you're missing out one of many great films from around the world.ything different or worthwhile.

B001UV4XHY|2.0|This is by far the most boring of all these movies. More than half of it takes place in the woods where nothing really happens.  All this could have been condensed to 5 minutes and there would be no need for the second movie.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling should be ashamed of herself for splitting this book into two movies and sucking her fans dry.
1932100660|1.0|This book is extremely misleading. Meat and fat are definitely not bad for your health.<br /><br />The culprits are rather the sugars and the refined carbohydrates in the modern diet.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and read for instance Gary Taubes' \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" to have a better picture.
0345529057|5.0|I am about 100 pages away from finishing the first book.  I love this paperback set of the first 4 books.  The books are easy to read.  I watched the series before reading this first book and find that it is definitely worth reading the book even if you have seen the first season of the series.  There are interesting tidbits of information in the book that help you understand more of the plot.  I intend to rewatch the first season after completing my read of the first book.

B003K9LZSO|5.0|The Doctor plays tourist, something we've never seen him do before, taking a 4-hour trip on a \\"bus\\" of the future to see a sapphire waterfall. The planet features no life at all due to deadly sun rays, so everything must be kept heavily shielded. Still, it's a beautiful world glistening with giant diamond and other crystalline rock formations--who wouldn't want to go to the resort there? Then, of course, it turns out life does exist, and this very small group with The Doctor are cut off from help when they encounter it. The encounter itself begins with terror--something that shouldn't be outside keeps pounding on the metal walls, spooking everyone. What follows is a psychological masterpiece of how people react to the unknown: fear, doubt, cruelty, curiosity, self-preservation, and more. I've watched this episode several times and pick up a little bit more each time, including one of the little clues leading up to the season finale. This isn't the typical episode--no Tardis, and Donna Noble only appears at the beginning and end--but it's great one if you like a fresh approach to the genre of \\"how do strangers act when trapped in a scary situation.\\" And pay attention--did anyone get the name of the hostess?
B0042816YK|4.0|I saw this movie at the theater and then bought the book. I am still reading through that, but since then have bought the dvd to remember the visuals from each place she visited. The music was great and the topics covered are serious and things we sometimes never dig deep enough to explore, yet they affect us just the same. I would recommend this to anyone dealing with crisis. The openness of the guy at the end with his kid just made it really hard to resist and there is a happy ending.
B004A8ZX28|2.0|This movie revolves around CORN...yes, corn, the kind you eat...like a can of corn nibblets there are many nibblets to fork your way through this film of intrigue...acting is good, but like cow corn...tough at times to figure what this film is all about???? However it is entertaining, best viewed when eating fresh corn-on-the cob or better yet...HOT BUTTERED POPCORN!...and a little understanding of German...Actually a fun movie! BUT STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT???? LIAM ON THE DVD COVER LOOKS SO CONCERNED..how concerned can you get about corn?...maybe he was a farmer before he became a man of mystery?
B002GYS1FO|5.0|I bought this album, and I knew it was going to be good, but I got some extra treats with this album too. The heavy is to me, a mix of funky Aerosmith crossed with James Brown, (Ok, steven has the voice, but soul... the soul)  Comming from a die hard progressive rock - heavy rock I was impressed. Has many of the same elements. Each song has a theme, if not parodied in such a way. It's a little different in that aspect, but I really like it, I certainly look forward to this bands next album. I am sure it will great! % stars all the way!

0307477479|1.0|Have to admit I let the positive critique lead me into buying this novel. Never touched anything by Egan before. Looked forward to starting this one but put it down after 20 pages, bored and annoyed by the flat style of her writing. Already there was enough missing to figure out the book can never live up to its early hype. Unfortunately so...
B003Y5H556|3.0|Set in a medieval village there is the same old story of a young girl betrothed to the son of a rich man but secretly in love with another.  There is a little layering of the story as there may have been another secret romance. Yet we have no time for those things as the wolf seems to be expanding his diet and a professional is called in for the dispatching of the misunderstood furry creature.<br /><br />Seems that our hooded heroine can communicate with the wolf which does not bode well of her future.<br />Will she go quietly or be eaten herself. Could be we are in for a big surprise.<br /><br />The movie was not brilliant but watchable. There was a wolf, a riding hood, and big teeth. There are a few scuffed and missing body parts as part of the story; however no excessive gore. It is good to see that Julie Christie (age 70 at time of filming) is keeping a hand in acting as the big eyed grandmother.

055357342X|5.0|Expect to be immersed in more fierce battles, incredible adventures, and surprising character development. Unlike the first two, this book is a no-yawner from cover to cover, and is much better than the \\"Feast for Crows\\" and \\"Dance with Dragons\\" combined. It's too bad that the series didn't conclude with this third very long book, while the author was still inspired for it. With pages numbering in the double digits, this should have been possible, but for the publishers and their contracts.

B0051MKMNC|5.0|Imagine what if there was a drug that had the ability to unlock the full capacity of your brain. Overnight you could be about anything you wanted because your ability to absorb would grow a hundred fold. That's the premise of the movie and it does a great job of showing us a story of a writer that can't seem to get his life on track and get his book going. In steps his brother-in-law from a marriage that failed in a chance street meeting. He gives him a gift of a drug as described not FDA approved or properly studied. Therefore the only problem is the lack of background on the long term affects. The pressure of the writers block makes his decision whether to try it easier.<br /><br />Thirty seconds later he realizes he can recall anything he has read or seen and he can describe or do it with a Houdini like ability. He even has the ability to quickly learn languages. Not only does this attract the attention of those that can help him become successful in business, it attracts those that want a piece of whatever he has. In order to get ahead fast he has to borrow money and not from anyone he wants to owe anything. The movie is constantly going forward at a fast pace never looking back. He tries to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, but they are close behind and he must figure out who they work for and what they know. Even when he links up with a business tycoon he finds he is in competition for the spoils. Can he beat them at their own game? Will he survive long term usage of a drug that has killed several? Check it out and find out. I don't think you will be disappointed. If you enjoyed this catch [[ASIN:B004XQO90E Source Code [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B004DK5CW4|1.0|Well,except for the remake of \\"Flicka\\" this is by far the worst horse racing movie I ever sat through, my mouth hanging open in disbelief!    First of all the hideous acting. Diane Lane basically called this one in, mostly standing there with that dumb half-smile. John Malkovich- basically mumbled all the way through, couldn't understand most of what he said. The Tweedy family were mostly cliched cut-outs standing around.    Getting to the horse stuff! Horse owners and breeders NEVER say their mares are \\"pregnant.\\" They are 'with foal\\", but I guess the dummies who gave this thing 5 stars need explanation. Has director Randall Wallace even ever watched the Triple Crown?!!! At the Kentucky Derby he had the crowds singing \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" long before the race. If he'd only watched ONE Kentucky Derby on TV he'd see that the song is NOT sung until the first horse places the first hoofprint on the track. There were no pony horses taking the racehorses to the gate. This is to keep the racehorses calm and assure they are not injured before the race itself.    The races were boring, boring, boring!! If Wallace had actually WATCHED a Triple Crown race he'd see that when a horse who has been behind starts to \\"move\\" at the stretch, the race announcer will catch that and give a rousing cry which lends an intense suspense to the race. These races were as exciting as washing dishes. ZZZzzzzzzz........The cinematography was dark, filmed on some dreary days so that these beautiful animals did not shine as they should.    I hate racing, know first hand what happens to these poor souls who do not win or earn their keep. Too horrible to tell you here. I only watched because it was on Starz. Would never pay to see this and glad I didn't!     If you want to see the BEST horse racing movie ever made, see \\"Phar Lap\\", the true story of an Australian underdog of a horse who became unbeatable. It has heart, soul, suspense, great acting and phenomenal photography. 5 hanky at least. And Phar Lap also was a victim of racing.    Please help make the racehorse an Endangered Species. Better yet, EXTINCT!!
0470932139|5.0|The book is very well written, and the included photographs are beautiful, rustic food photos.  Even if your style of food photography is very different from the author's, there is still much than can be learned from her. Photographing food can be very different from other types of photography, and the author addresses the unique aspects of food photography, and the entire process of achieving mouth-watering photos.  Although it may seem easy, anyone who has tried it understands how difficult is to achieve beautiful food photos.  But it is also a wonderful avenue to truly learn and understand the fundamentals of photography--which this book teaches so well.        Other reviewers have mentioned the conversational style of this book.  Photography can be very technical, and perhaps that is why it is so difficult for some to learn and explore.  (I know it was for me!)  The author has a gift for presenting this information in a way that is not only easy to understand, but is actually fun to read.  And, if you are a visual learner, the photographs in the book do a wonderful job of showing the various techniques as well as the different camera settings.  For example, she doesn't just explain depth of field and white balance, she shows you with pictures.     This book ended up being a very expensive purchase for me because it inspired me to buy a new camera.  Having had an slr camera and only using it on auto, my digital camera purchases were all point & shoot cameras.  I never put in the time to learn how to use my slr, so I could not justify the expense of a new dslr.  But this book inspired me and gave me a desire to explore and learn photography in a way I never have before.  And I longed for the control that I cannot get with my p&s camera.  I know that I will re-read and reference this book constantly as I learn to use my camera and, and as I continue to explore food photography for my blog.  But, with that being said--even if you have a p&s camera, there is so muchyou can learn from this book.

B0051OZ564|1.0|this movie absolutely sucked.the charecters bring you into a dream world to cope with everyday problems.you enter the dream world like 4-5 times during the whole movie.it is sad that this whole movie is based around women whom are eye candy and that is what they push on you in this movie.as a man i don't care how good looking women are in a movie or how tight their clothing is.if the plot of the movie sucks the movie sucks plain and simple.I would rather go to the dentist than watch this again.
B003U9NAD2|5.0|This album surpasses all metal and has not been matched since.  Four lengthy songs in a symphonic ambient black metal style takes metal to its highest point in evolution and beyond.    This one-man band orchestrates with a thematic narrative that puts the listener into a dreamlike state.  Simple riffs are layered to create epic structures and are ambient in tone resulting in a range of moods while maintaining a trancelike effect.  Shifting harmonies throughout these themes creates a journey of intense emotion and heavy realizations.  Each track varies in speed and style but are all strongly connected like a classical movement.  Ideological impact is the key to this albums power as songs drive forth with outstanding passion and sincerity.  The subtlety is so deep that each listen will evoke feelings of wonder and majesty no matter how many times visited.  It is an epic poetic story that is mystical yet symbolic to reality - it literally awakens your soul with a vision of eternal order through chaos.  The album ends with an ambient keyboard track that is minimal and allows heavy reflection and resolution after the severe intensity and whirlwind of emotion from the first three tracks.    The result is an experience like no other album of modern times.  Its power is immense and makes us contemplate the deepest questions of our very existence.  In the age of our moribund civilisation this album is the ultimate warcry against the stupidity of the modern world.    Check out the dark legions archive for more high quality metal:  [...]

B005DD7H50|5.0|The pre-release previews I watched online and on T.V. were intriguing. The idea that something, or some substance could bring hightened capability and focus to a human being interested me enough to want to go to the theater when it came out. I missed it, and had to wait for rental release. I am not disapointed. That idea did not loose momentum in the movie and delt with conceivable scenarios for those who used NZT-48. I think it was well acted, was clever in character developement (well written), and entirely plausible. I've enjoyed Robert De Niro in most of his films and he was great in this one.

B001FB55H6|5.0|I love love loved this movie.  I've been a fan of the novel since I discovered it and felt like Zach Snyder stayed as true to it as he possibly could during this day and age where directors have less power over their movies.  I felt like he brought the novel as alive as he could and it is just a beautiful movie.  The guy has incredible vision.  His movie 300 was a beautiful film and this just shows his technical abilities are getting better and better.  Even though Sucker Punch was a piece of crap, it looked amazing    That said, I must admit that I am a sucker for comic book/graphic novel movies.  Although The Green Lantern was panned by critics and had some weaknesses, I still loved it.  Sooooo - I'm definitely a biased person, but if you're a fanboy like me, holy crap does this move rock da house.
B000008JI1|3.0|Seems ridiculous to be hearing this for the first time in 2011 but hey, I was only ever a very casual listener to this mob back in the day having had other guilty pleasures taking up my time. But having listened to this thing three times in a row yesterday I have to admit it is sprightly and lightly rendered rock `n' roll from a band that by this state (1993) were veterans of the music biz.<br /><br />The album comprises 15 tracks  with the bands trademark zest for life imprinted all over them but on this album they had moved on from their earlier image and modus operendi somewhat. The lavender boy vocals of Bret Michaels are still in place but on this album the band seem to stretching out and doing different things. This becomes obvious from the title track, which is also the first tune on the album. It shows a few studio tricks being used to create a more offbeat result and it's not a bad move. As the album mooches along the band are able to go up and down the gears with ease. There aren't too many genuinely crunchy guitar numbers but this very much feels like a rock band working hard to put on a show. In fact the lightness of being here is one of the reasons you can play it in the background to good effect and even though there are 15 tracks here the album doesn't feel overlong.<br /><br />Production is as nice as you'd expect it and Ritchie Kotzen certainly adds something different in the guitar department. I remember the quip at the time being that in order to maintain their previous guitar stylings that Kotzen would have to play with boxing gloves on. Well it doesn't sound like he went that route but certainly his being in Poison for a while is an interesting adjunct to the chaps career. Probably paid OK too...<br /><br />The main downpoints here are how G rated this feels. How hollow many of the songs come across as in terms of having any meat on the bone. Not just musically, it's just that when you have the background of Poison it's pretty hard to get people to take your musings on lifes ups and downs too seriously. Bon Jovi had the same issue in his desperation to be seen as something akin to Bruce Springsteen or even John Mellencamp. So while there is an attempt at growth here it's hard to take it too seriously and the cover art, which was probably supposed to come across as understated and/or embattled just comes across as dour. Something that is anathema to this bands manifesto. And while the band have tried manfully to incorporate more blues into their side... well I was around at the time and let me tell you brother, darn near EVERY pop metal band tried to do the same thing, either to mature with their fans, to get taken seriously or just because everyone was doing it.<br /><br />This probably isn't a bad album to throw on in the car. It's not cringe inducing stuff you can only play when nobody else is around (trust me, I have plenty of those albums myself!) but given it's not terribly accomplished and given how much more great music there is out there I just can't see anybody throwing this on at any time when they are actually in the mood to really listen to the music coming out of their stereo. And therein lies a big reason why this is only three starss IMHO.n lifes ups and downs too seriously.

B000MKXEME|5.0|It's your loss if you haven't seen this movie.  Jeffrey Combs is the perfect mad scientist and Barbara Crampton makes an awesome damsel in distress.  The chemistry (if you'll pardon the pun) is electric on the set.  You can tell the actors had fun making this movie and the director made the movie he wanted to make.  Not only is the movie great, but the extras on this DVD are equally awesome.  My favorite is the commentary after you've watched the movie of course.  Watch the movie again listening to the commentary with the producer and actors.  It is hillarious.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|IN YOUR DREAMS is yet another great Stevie Nicks CD. When it came out, she hadn't released an album in ten years, but it was worth the wait. Her last album, TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA, showed her musing on more realistic themes, such as how we tend to take inspiration from famous sports stars in order to keep our weight down, only to find out that they're only human, but here she returns to the more mystical themes of her early work. She even reunites with Lindsey Buckingham on the antiwar song \\"Soldier's Angel\\", and collaborates with Dave Stewart on most of the rest. Overall, this is an important CD in Nicks' career.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|I purchased this DVD after renting the Queen Rock Montreal concert via Netflix, which rekindled my love for Queen. I was a Queen fan in Jr. High and High School (saw them perform live in 1978 in Kansas City), but lost track of them in the early 1980's. My renewed interest came after seeing a rock documentary about Queen on the Ovation channel and then another documentary about Freddie Mercury: The Untold Story.  I have to say, I wasn't expecting to like this DVD. I was a fan of Queen in their early long-hair days.  I had not even listened to their music seriously since about 1980.  But I was just blown away by this concert. The band is so tight and in such great form. Freddie Mercury is incredible to watch - you can't take your eyes off him. He fills every second on stage with his presence and showmanship.     Watch the concert all the way through and then watch it again with Roger Taylor and Brian May's commentary. They take a while to get going and there are a few long silences, but they give an explanation as to why this film was not presented until recently. Something to do with having a falling out with the film makers and not having access to it all these years. The film is actually two concerts spliced together from the two concert dates in 1981 in Montreal ( you can tell by the costume changes) which they had restored and edited recently. The audio and visual quality are amazing for something this old. There is nothing like real film. Video does not even compare- you wonder, why even bother wth video when you have film that does such a superb job? The audio is so clean and the images so crisp! The later concerts do not even hold a candle to this in regards to quality. And I have to say Freddie Mercury was in rare form at the Montreal Show. Watching him jump back and forth to the piano with perfect timing is amazing. He never loses hold of the audience and keeps the group cooking away for full hour and a half. Yes, this is the concert in its entirety. Apparently this was one of the last times Queen performed with just the four guys and no additional musicians help. In the later concerts, Freddie got away from playing the piano as it kept him away from the stage and he wanted to walk around and sing and entertain the audience - and HOW!!! His voice is amazing!    Taylor and May's comments on the commentary are very endearing too as they tell little anecdotes about the band and compliment each other on drum fills and guitar solos and such during the concert. You can tell they have great respect for each other and a lot of love for Freddie Mercury and it comes out in how they notice and comment on the details; such as how nice it is to see Freddie Mercury in his muscular prime. They also mention how the band had freedome to improvise and do what they wanted during the concerts, whereas now, groups are all programmed in concert where you are not even hearing live music sometimes. I went to see a lot of rock concerts in the 1970's, and now that I think of it, they really had to work a lot harder in those days, as there just was not all the technology around that we take for granted today.    I also have to say that this concert made me realize how underappreciated Queen is now and was then. They were a truly amazing group and came up with some incredible innovations that they just don't get enough credit for. Perhaps Bohemian Rhapsody was just over played and people came to think of it as campy and jokey? And I also think a lot of people in the 1970's 80's were somewhat homophobic - and Freddie Mercury's flamboyant lifestyle on and off stage was just too wild for the maintstream? But I have to say, after watching this video and the other documentaries I saw, I realize now what an important and serious musician Freddie Mercury was and how it was his creative ideas that brought Queen to fame. Not to take anything away from the other guys - all incredible musicians in their own right who don't get enough credit for their contribution to the group's musical success. Freddie Mercury was an incredible performer who gave the audience so much more than their money's worth. You can see that he really loved what he was doing. He lived his life the way he wanted, and in doing so, as his mother says on one of the documentaries, \\"he made the whole world happy\\". There is too much snickering about his being gay and his flamboyant lifestyle. So what?  Like Oscar Wilde, he was really a man born out of his time. Oh Queen - Oh Freddie, how I miss you guys!!

Jaycee Dugard deserves a special place in heaven because she has already lived in hell most of her life.<br /><br />It was very painful reading this book. I knew that it would be when I bought it. I bought it to show my support for Jaycee and the hell she has been through for the 18 years that ba$tard stole from her life. I am glad I read it though. If Jaycee had the courage to live it and then to write honestly about what happened to her, then the least I could do was to have the courage to read her story.
0061353248|5.0|Ariely does two things in this book. First, he shows many ways in which humans consistently act irrationally: although we often don't act in line with the predictions of traditional economic theory, neither do we act chaotically. Second, he shows that we are also routinely bad at predicting how irrational our behavior will be. However, I would have liked an appendix explaining just what the term rational means.    Of course to do social science we need to abstract from how people behave to find general principles, lest we not be able to make general statements and get lost in particulars and be able to say nothing. We want to make abstractions that don't lose too much information. But human beings behaving rationally is not even a good first approximation to how people really behave. This vitiates economic theories that depend on rational utility maximizing individuals.    Chapter 1: Relativity. Having a choice that no one actually chooses can affect the decisions people make. People are more comfortable choosing an option if they have a clearly inferior option that makes it look better by comparison, since it's hard to compare very different options. So a good wingman will look similar to you but worse, rather than have a completely different body type. We will spend half an hour saving $7 off of $25 but won't spend half an hour saving $7 off of $455, even though in both cases the question ought to be are we willing to spend half an hour to save $7. Try to think about the $7 detached from a $25 purchase or a $455 purchase. Chapter 2: Anchoring. Thinking about a high number will make you more willing to pay more. People value things according to the original achors, not by how much utility they get from the thing, and thus having more options to trade can make people less happy: I can like something but irrationally sell it cheaply because of a low anchor. Chapter 3: There is an irrational difference between paying a small price and paying zero. Chapter 4: Social norms and market norms. There is tension about which norm we are using. Chapter 5: We can't predict how we will think when in an aroused state. The only way to control emotions is to remove oneself from a situation before the event horizon after which you can't go back. This applies to sex and food. Chapter 6: Procrastination and self-control. We do better when we have deadlines. Chapter 7: We irrationally value what we already have. Try to view all transactions as a nonowner. Chapter 8: We overvalue keeping options available. It can be helpful to have fewer options, yet we spend resources keeping useless options available. Chapter 9: Expectations affect experience. Chapter 10: Placebos; continuation of previous chapter. Chapter 11: When we have the chance we cheat but not as much as we could. To stay honest we need to be reminded of ethics at the moment of decision, not in a general way. Chapter 12: We steal much more when the object is not money than when it's money, even when it's just tokens that we immediately convert to money, and yet people don't expect that this is true. Chapter 13: Conclusion. Standard economic views are based on rational behavior, which this book has shown people very often do not exhibit. Therefore many conclusions of standard economic theory are baseless; they may or may not be correct, but they are not justified because their assumptions are false. Economics needs instead to be based on how people actually behave, and this is the intent of behavioral economics. Moreover, many big problems like people not saving enough are incomprehensible by standard economics.
B004LROMSO|2.0|Well, \\"too bad\\" sums it up, unfortunately.  Too bad to enjoy, too bad to watch, too bad to buy, et cetera ad infinitum.  The other reviews cover most of that.  But I'd just like to add, \\"Too bad the photography director wasn't also the writing team, the main director, and at least half the actors.\\"  I really do regret that I'll miss the wonderful photography because I absolutely cannot stomach the puerile efforts of the writers, director and actors trying so hard to achieve success by reducing Camelot to two-dimensional soft porn.  What a waste.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Love the special features - the video picture-in-picture is great if you want a running commentary (and you can have subtitles of the movie going on in the background, so you can watch both at once)

B0040T7CFS|5.0|I've bought this twice now, the previous version, and then this new version (when it first became available at Amazon UK at a higher price).  I wanted to have a set at work.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of Bach, and I thought this would be a good set to see if there was anything else I liked. I've listened to the whole set twice now.  At least one CD at night, for months.<br /><br />It is staggering how much great music Bach did.  I've also listened to the Beethoven and Mozart sets.  In my opinion, Bach wrote much more great music.  His Cantata series, over 60 CDs, have something incredible on every CD.  Even after four years with this set, I'm still trying to narrow down everything that I like on all these CDs.<br /><br />There are some boring bits.  The Recitarios usually involve someone reading a piece of text in German to very minimal music, and every Cantana has several.  However, these are surrounded by incredible instrumental pieces, and equally incredible choruses.  I thought the singers were quite good.<br /><br />Individual pieces, it's easy to find better versions.  Bach's Chaconne, for example, is good here, but I've heard staggering greatness elsewhere.  Here's what Braham's had to say about the Chaconne: \\"On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I could have created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the excess of excitement and earth-shattering experience would have driven me out of my mind.\\"<br /><br />I feel like that with almost every CD in this set.  If you generally like Bach, you will easily quintuple the amount that you like with this gigantic set.  Highly, highly, highly recommended.  Of all my purchases on Amazon, this was by far my favorite purchase, even after four years.

B002X7FELS|1.0|I do really like the book, actually I mean the content of it, but the quality of the book is bad, very very bad, it's the book from museums. moreover, the appearance of it is bad and unacceptable. the picture on the website is not the real photos, since there is also a tag from the museum on the cover. how can i store this book. It's a really bad experience of buying things on amazon. Hope it's the only one. Jesus!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Admittedly, I find the subject of this film fascinating.  I enjoyed it so much that I've already watched it twice and loaned it out to others.  It is an interesting and informative documentary on the financial crisis.
0811876373|3.0|I liked the ideas in the book and the explanation of the techniques were helpful but I was hoping for more recipes for creativity. With pictures galore on the internet I wanted more fail-proof recipies for cake balls/pops.     I've been famouse for my german chocolate balls that I've perfected over the past 6 years and find it one of the most creative combos so I was hoping to get more inspiration through this book and it only had basic recipes.     I do recommend the book for inspiration but not more.
0553801473|3.0|I really enjoyed the first three quarters of the book. Then I started to worry, because I came to realize that there is something wrong. The story stalls and slows down instead of reaching it's climax. Then it happens. The air freezes. The falling body does not hit the ground. Everything comes to a sudden halt - - - it's time for the commercial. No - wait - I was reading a book! It feels as if the author and his editor are kicking me into my guts. This cliffhanger book must be unique in the history of publishing. And a sentence comes into my mind: \\"What authors do for money.\\"
B004A8ZX2S|5.0|\\"There are two ways through life: the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one you'll follow. Grace doesn't try to please itself. Accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked. Accepts insults and injuries. Nature only wants to please itself. Get others to please it too. Likes to lord it over them. To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things,\\" writer/director Terrence Malick.<br /><br />The choice between nature and grace is a hard one for most people, but it's actually a struggle for the main character of \\"The Tree of Life,\\" Jack, who was raised by polar-opposite parents: a compassionate, free-spirited mother (the lovely Jessica Chastain), and a stern, disciplinarian father (played by Brad Pitt. Side note: the late Heath Ledger was originally casted for this role).<br /><br />The adult Jack is an architect and seems trapped and suffocated (the perfect role for Sean Penn), not only by his current environment in a modern city of glass and metal, but by the unresolved issues with his brother's death as a teen and a complicated relationship with his father. And I'll even venture to say that he's also questioning his place in the universe, the meaning of it all.<br /><br />Through Jack's fragmented memory we travel back in time (way back...like billions of years) to witness--with visual splendor--the birth of the cosmos and earth's formation (dinosaurs and all), before making a stop in the 1950's during his childhood in a small town in Texas.  The cinematography during this part of the film is much more subtle but equally splendid, with curtains swaying in the breeze, a shot of Jack during a lazy summer afternoon laying on a picnic blanket next to his mother, cheerful kids chasing after clouds of DDT smoke coming from a passing truck, the pleats of his mother's dress, the swing on the green front yard, the warmth of the light in their house...<br /><br />You'll have to watch the film to continue that journey through time. But please understand that it's a different type of movie, which has won the praise of critics as well as the confusion of many viewers. Take a look at Yahoo Movies where critics rated it an A- while users gave it a C+. I've actually heard of people asking for their money back; and I can honestly see why.<br /><br />Yet the stunning imagery, accompanied by an equally-impressive score, transcends your normal movie-going experience; some feel watching the film is more like a spiritual/religious experience of sorts for it reminds us of the miracle of life, nature, family ties, and our own existence.<br /><br />Go watch it with an open mind and heart because \\"The Tree of Life\\" is nothing short of majestic, awe-inspiring, a masterpiece.nue that journey through time.

B0017YZIL4|5.0|Wes Montgomery speaks clearly for himself in his playing.  No one is more composed.  These songs are real jazz, not the pop stuff his label made him play for greater and wider listener acceptance.  This is great listening for the casual fan as the music is mellow and relaxing.  Not bad to play along too either for the practicing improvisationist.
B003ASLJMW|5.0|Wonderful film in every way. I saw this movie, no joke, when I was 7 years old. I went with my parents to see this. Looking back on it, the KGB kicking butt, lots of assassinations, plenty of havoc, probably not a Disney flick for kids, but what the heck!  I loved it as a kid!  I went with my parents just to see the MIG!    This movie was made in the Cold War, at the height of it. The funny thing about these Firefox and Red October movies is that they always portray the KGB and the Soviets as being on the cutting edge with the U.S. having to steal or copy or spy on their latest technical achievement. The reality was, despite beating us into outer space, the Soviets were the copycats!  The GRU and KGB gots its tech from Silicon Valley and stealing secrets from us!    Nevertheless, the scenes in the film where Gant (Eastwood) is trying to get through Moscow, in the subway especially, are very much fingernail biters.  The film creates solid tension and the action and intrigue are abundant.    The scenes of Gant stealing the MIG were great and the last part of the film, the chase, was well done for its time.  Warning: if you're looking for top-notch special effects a la Lord of the Rings, think again!  In 1982 at the theatre as a kid I felt like I was in Nirvana!  Now watching the movie, I still ADORE it, but wow the effects....pretty dang thin....It's just important to watch the movie in context of the times and use some imagination and have patience with things of that FX nature.  The \\"think in Russian\\" part? Probably the lamest of the whole film. Oh also, don't watch the altimeter of the MIG! It changes in each scene so drastically that I've read even a category 4 hurricane couldn't change it that much! LOL    Wonderful movie in general. I really loved it then and now.
0887081770|4.0|My son adores this book but I was surprised to find that it's a miniature book. I was rather disappointed when I looked back at what is sold on Amazon to find that this and a board book are the only versions available. It's rather hard to read and the details are not as enjoyable when it's so small.    It's a very cute story and we love all the foldouts. He loves the moon so it's great to have this and compare with the full moon when it's visible.    I suppose the 4\\"x6\\" size is great for travel but I'd prefer a regular sized book.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|This is the pinnacle, the high point, of the Dead Trilogy. I'm a big Day of the Dead fan, but Dawn is the greatest, hands down.  There are many emotions and concepts and thoughts this movie invokes:  the childish \\"what if I were the only person left on earth and I could shopping-spree the mall!?\\" and the ideas about humanity feeding on itself, Romero's theme of consumerism and greed that had consumed America in the 70's and 80's, suvival, relationships, friendships, you name it. This movie kicks butt.    Ken Foree is amazing as Peter. His delivery was outstanding as the badass muscle that ends up being full of humanity and courage.  David Emgee as \\"Flyboy\\" Stephen, awesome.  Gaylen Ross did a tremendous job conveying a sense of sadness, emptiness, and loss amidst trying to continue her relationship pregnant and in a world of despair.  Roger, played by Scott H. Reiniger was probably my favorite character.    The best dialogue of the whole film?    \\"Francine Parker: They're still here.   Stephen: They're after us. They know we're still in here.   Peter: They're after the place. They don't know why, they just remember. Remember that they want to be in here.   Francine Parker: What the hell are they?   Peter: They're us, that's all, when there's no more room in hell.   Stephen: What?   Peter: Something my granddad used to tell us. You know Macumba? Voodoo. My granddad was a priest in Trinidad. He used to tell us, \\"When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.\\"     I love the character studies of the Dead Trilogy, how humanity comes together or falls to pieces in a crisis and how much actual humanity is retained. Good stuff!     If anybody tells you these zombie flicks are just blood and guts, they're nuts.    One last item:  look for the guy in the biker gang who is SO STUPID that he puts his arm in the cuff of a bloodpressure testing machine WHILE the zombies are storming the mall!  This cat earns the stupidest human being in history award!
0062060554|4.0|I must say, loving good characterization and a good bit of the psychology of a story, this first time novel was very very well done.  I ignored an early insight in the story which turns out to have been the right road to travel.  Although I'm glad I did not get it so early in the book.  And the ending left as it is, what can I say.  A great first book.  Give it a try.
0811875040|5.0|I love this cookbook. It's so beautiful and well written. I use to think the banana bread recipe from the Flour cookbook was the best ever but the recipe in this book far exceed. Also, the cheesecake is so good. I love the fact the recipes make small portions compared to other cookbook. I just love this book and highly recommend it.
B004BLDD9Y|3.0|I love these as my kitchen fan has 4 bulbs pervious using four 40 watt bulbs ie 160 watts now I have 3 of them and running at 15 watts and when there available again at a good price I be getting a few more I just wish i had ordered one more to put in the last bulb.<br /><br />Also one advantage is no filaments so they do not wear out in ceiling fans any faster the non vibration areas and the light out put is just as good as my old 40 watts with the trade off of a slight color shift but for 140 watt savings with long lasting bulbs it of a little manor<br /><br />one already fail so the quality of these bulbs are questable<br />update all the rest seemn to be fine and amazon replaced  the defive bulb
B002NZK5RI|5.0|This was a thoroughly enjoyable film. I think Sigourney Weaver, as usual, makes her character, Helen, sympathetic, powerful, and believable as hell.  Holy Hunter didn't work for me. She seemed to be a hillbilly as M.J. in San Francisco...kind of odd.  I think the film would've been better had she not played the detective working with Weaver's character.      Harry Connick Jr. was a real humdinger in this flick. He's a real loser and quite genuine in his desire to terrorize Helen's life vicariously through a copycat protege of his.    The movie has a lot of twists and turns, is not predictable or cliche, and has some solid acting. I really got into it when I watched it on DVD and wondered, \\"how did I miss this little gem in the mid 90's?\\" Maybe it was my college days that sucked away my time to enjoy a good thriller!      Watch this movie. It's entertaining and cheap fun. It's available on DVD often times in a tandem with other thrillers on a 4 pack, etc. That's how I got it!     Cheers!
B002NPY7FE|5.0|I hadn't seen this years, so when I saw the Blu-ray at an affordable price I had the get it. It's really a decent little story, even with the realistically beyond annoying little whining kid. The Hd transfer is decent, not amazing but acceptable. I plan on getting all the King stuff on Blu-ray so this is a good start, I am not ready to double up on my King DVD collection completely yet.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|The design of this is kinda cheap. There's a cover for the battery screw and it barely stays on. Went ahead and took it off because this was bound to fall off in a purse or pocket or just sitting on a table. The regular pen worked fine, but the UV ink didn't work. It was so dried out even dipping it in water didn't reactivate it. Kinda disappointing.
0553801473|4.0|----------This review contains no spoilers to Dance with Dragons. ----------<br /><br />I have read and loved the world George R.R. Martin created for many years now.  I first read Game of Thrones about 10 years ago, and have been enchanted and engrossed in A Song of Ice and Fire since then.  First, I would preface my opinion by stating what I would rate each of the books in the series.  I would give 5 stars to A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords.  I would give 3 stars to A Feast for Crows.  And I give 4 stars to A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />Dance kept me page-turning more than Feast (which felt more sluggish and departed from the original three books).  In Dance, I enjoyed the characters covered much more. There were a lot of \\"oh wow\\" moments and some definite surprises. Reading some of the reviews on Amazon, I tend to agree with a lot of the other 4-star reviews. Martin's writing is very good, and he still has the ability to surprise; but I agree that it's frustrating with how many things were left hanging and not understanding the point of some of the things that have gone on. It may be that as the rest of the story unfolds I will understand it more. Dance leaves off with a lot of uncertainties but with the feeling that the next novel is going to be huge with a lot of elements pulling together and a lot more resolution. A Storm of Swords was very much a climactic novel, and it left the period of time that Feast and Dance covers to regather and rebuild. And it builds a great deal in Dance.<br /><br />I think some of the bad reviews are people frustrated because of this building, and the desire for more resolution, not liking the idea of waiting years for more answers. My own hope is that the next book will not be so long in coming, because the tension of the story is built up high now, it seems like a lot of foundation is relaid since Storm. Things feel very ripe for an explosion of action.<br /><br />I don't really feel that some of thebad reviews I have read are deserved. The scope of the story has grown and broadened since the first book, where it initially focused on a few people, and it now is cascading out as the impact of those characters and their stories affect the state of Martin's world. The history of the world he has created is impressively rich. I won't say that I love everything that happens; I still hate what happened to Eddard for that matter. I wonder at the decisions and choices of some of the characters I've gotten close to, but they are so very human and real in my opinion.<br /><br />After reading it, I have a lot of various hopes and worries for characters, and to my mind it is a talented author who can provoke such feelings from the pages of a book.  I will be sitting and waiting for the next, as I waited for Feast and I waited for Dance.
B002N57KG2|4.0|Where to start? This movie is crazy, no doubt. The plot is insane, the stuff they do in this film would never go down with the politically correct age we live in...I can imagine Reynold's comment \\"the chocolate monk\\" to Sammy Davis nowdays!    I love the one-liners, the constant references to \\"Mr..uh...Foyt!,\\" Jamie Farr steals the show as the sheik who is determined that the Cannonball Race will \\"fall to the forces of Islam!\\" and Roger Moore stars as a Jewish rich kid who thinks he's Roger Moore!  There are enough crashes and explosions to put in ten movies, plenty of goofy stuff with \\"Captain Chaos\\" and the Hell's Angels battle.    Jack Elam is priceless as a creepy proctologist who agrees to go with Reynolds and Deluise for $200....His desires to give an exam to everyone, hilarious!    Jackie Chan is in this movie, super young, full of energy, and trying to watch a porn film \\"Behind the Green Door\\" that almost gets him killed while driving!     I'm frustrated that so many words were dubbed out of this movie, just like Smokey and the Bandit. I'm not a vulgarity fan but sometimes it works in the film and just makes it funny. The words they substitute are lame and untimely.    I love the Lamborghini scenes and the two girls in the car were even better!     If you want a guilty pleasure laugh and some fun on a weekend afternoon, watch Cannonball. It's not The Killing Fields or Amadeus, but it's fun....
159562015X|5.0|I found this book and test to be incredibly helpful in helping me understand a bit better who I am, what makes me tick, and what I am talented at.  It has helped me to redefine some goals in my life and alter my life path to better use my talents for the benefit of others.  Highly recommended.
0375836675|5.0|I started reading this book after I had first read The Book Thief (which I enjoyed).  In my opinion, this book was twice as good.  I would give it more stars if possible.  I just couldn't put it down.  I knocked it out in 2 nights, before bed.  Although I predicted who was sending the cards early on, it didn't take away from the story at all.  I would have to say this is one of the best books I have ever read.
0345529057|4.0|Enthralling books, especially if you've watched the series. The experience is like a director's cut - the same scenes playing over in your head, but with a LOT more detail. Very well written, and the TV series is very true to the book.    The paperbacks themselves however are very poor quality - basically disposable. For the price though, it is to be expected.
B005CMGKTG|4.0|This DVD lives up to it's expectations. For American fans of Space Battleship Yamato, adapted into Star Blazers at the height of the Star Wars craze circa 1979, there will be no disappointment whatsoever. Being one of those fans that saw the toned down dubbed English version I have been following the series ever since. My background with the series may be more extensive as I have no problem watching the original with sub-titles so take that as you may.    It was with mixed reservations that I finally got to see the December 2010 movie adaptation of my childhood favorite cartoon. Having seen it twice now I can tell you two truisms:    1. It has been worth the wait.  2. The movie was made by fans of the original show.    If you have been a close follower of the show, the first 30 minutes plays such a homage to the original I am almost naming my goosebumps. The story-line, characters, ship, soundtrack, action flow, practically the entire first episode including camera angles, has been beautifully recreated. At around 2 hours to cover the original 26 \\"Quest To Iscandar\\" episodes I think this has been a beautiful homage to fans of the original series or it's American counterpart. Wildstar (US) or Shima (JA) still has his growth period but is the central character. The only really changed character is IQ9 whose transformation to the big screen couldn't have been better done. Sane (US) or Sato (JA) even still has his cat and famous \\"spring water.\\"    The Good: As mentioned above and special effects. IMDB reports 15 million spent on the movie, primarily on special effects. Quite frankly I find that impossible. What I saw, rivaled Avatar.     The Bad: Storyline, is radically departed by the end of the movie (sequel possibilities would only involve Andromeda if you take my meaning).     The Interesting:   1. Import only so sub-title English and Chinese only.   2. Product was ordered through Amazon (Asian Entertainment (DVD))on a Monday and arrived Wednesday with standard delivery options.  3. Product is stated as being all region DVD. Tried on Region 1 with no problem whatsoever.  4. Regular DVD came with no special features.    Final word: Absolutely loved it.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Subtle yet engaging and a bit slow in certain parts but overall it tells the story. What I like about this movie is it draws comparisons and gives the viewers a slice of what it means to be someone who does that sort of thing and how it impacts on him and those with whom he comes in contact. George Clooney does a great job in this no frills assignment.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been playing this nonstop for over a month.  That's really all I need to say.  Droid Incredible with Skyraider 4.3, no issues whatsoever.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|This blu-ray collection DOES NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS.  I have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the original versions of the films to be released properly.  Will it ever happen for us?  So far, we have the \\"Limited Edition\\" dvds, which contain the original theatrical versions, but that's it.  Everything else seems to be the \\"Special Editions.\\" The \\"Special Edition\\" versions of the films are as insulting as...   ...as touching-up the Mona Lisa using crayons, and adding a mustache!  Okay, I went a little overboard there, but I remain firm on this.  I will not purchase Star Wars on blu-ray unless it has the original theatrical versions.
0811875040|3.0|This is a very pretty book, but it is not for the unskilled baker. I made three things from it in the last week, and I feel like the book could use editing. For example, the recipe for vanilla buttercream has the same instructions listed (in different ways) in steps 2 and 3 - it may be confusing for someone who hasn't baked frequently. The recipe for chocolate cake (as used in the cover recipe) says to divide the batter equally between the pans, but doesn't specify how full the pans should be. I filled my pans 2/3 full (fairly standard) and they overflowed in my oven - I also had enough batter in reserve to make 6 cupcakes at the same time - if someone were to be literal and divide all the batter it would be a disaster. In addition, the sizes of pans the recipes required are difficult to find unless you are in a specialty store. Everything tastes wonderful, but this book could benefit from a bit of a test kitchen trial with non-professional bakers and a revision. I do not recommend it for people who are unskilled.
B003XRELGQ|1.0|Perhaps it's my age. I'm 22. I've heard that this book is supposed to be a \\"must read.\\" So I decided to sit down and actually read this thing.    I don't get the hype. Seriously. It's too scattered and too random. It may have started off interesting, when the main character first began his interviews...but it all did not mesh well for me and it was VERY boring.    It seems like a very poor attempt to try to appear intellectual. I did not find this book intellectually stimulating at all or find it \\"mind boggling\\" or full of \\"wisdom.\\"  I didn't get the satire or find the satire at all amusing.  It was a waste of time for me to read this book.    I would have liked to see more ice-9, and to go more in depth with ice-9. And perhaps even more post ice-9 chapters for the ending.   I wasn't very satisfied with the ending either--I wasn't satisfied with the book at all actually.    At least I can say that I've read Cat's Cradle? Umm...yeah.        Note for kindle edition:   1) Little to no errors in kindle edition (I did not find any).  2) Chapters are all complete (I compared to a paperback of Cat's Cradle).  3) No page numbers are listed, only location.  4) Format is just fine--it's perfect.  5) Table of Contents is included.

B003J27WFW|5.0|I figured I'd better do this now after watching it or I'll never do it. It's the best of the best for life-long Rush fans. There are 300 other reviews here so I'll make mine to the point. Superbly produced - well thought out with good segues. The \\"extras\\" on the 2nd video are good too - especially the \\"animated\\" (P'd) up dinner between the three. Very funny - Alex really is a funny guy. The motorcyclce trip by Neal after the family tragedies is dealt with in a tasteful manner. No talk of his African bike trip, and no discussion of Alex's brush with the law in Florida or wherever that was. Overall the DVD delivers - scenes and stories that the vast majority of us wouldn't have seen before. I should add that I live in Thailand, and while rush.com or whatever the main site is called wouldn't deliver it here, Amazon semed to have no problem. Of course I had to watch it on the computer. Having said that, you should be aware that good ol Mircrosoft said if I watched this I could never switch back and watch Zone 3 videos again (Asia zone). So f'ing what - I switched to Zone 1 - just for you Rush! (hope I don't regret that later!!)
B0034G4P8A|5.0|My son and i saw this movie at the theaters in 3D! Everything about this movie is A+ - actors, music, storyline, stunts, costumes, graphics etc. The best movie of 2011 hands down!!!! Can't wait to get the dvd!
B004G6009U|5.0|Wasn't sure about this movie, but had heard good things about it and am glad we jumped in; this is a great movie, stunningly beautiful animation with a great redemptive story - definitely a new take on the Rapunzel story I was raised on. It is a bit dark at times, and so I wouldn't recommend it for youngsters under 5, but then I tend to error on the side of caution with young children. Why introduce them to hitting if you don't need to?    Anyway, there are a set of tidbits on the Blu-ray that are also great, outtakes as it were though really sort of clever commercials for things like available real estate (since the tower is no longer occupied) and the multiple uses of a frying pan.    Simply put, this is one of the best disney animated movies ever!
B004WKOCP8|5.0|The time has come and it was worth the wait.  This CD captures the esence of INCUBUS...it cannot get any better than this.  Every song has their own unique signature.  Pesonally my favorite of all songs are Friends and Lovers...OMG the beat of the drums of that song is truly amazing, this song is beyond words can describe! Thieves is just the pure classic style of incubus. Promises, promises really great song.    I think all the songs of the CD are really great. Each song has something that makes it unique.  Once again INCUBUS has nailed it.    I truly recomend this CD...if we could have more stars I will put like 10 more. Just amazing! :-)
B004XQO90O|5.0|The storyline wasn't the greatest.  But WOW!  If you wanna stare at Jake Gyllenhaal's face for 2 hours (like I do lol) you gotta buy it!  <3
B003Y5H542|5.0|To invert my recent review of \\"Cars 2\\"... I was expecting a very good movie. But \\"Rango\\" turned out to be a downright terrific one. It's the kind of animated film Pixar pioneered (joke intended), but seems to have forgotten how to make.<br /><br />\\"Rango\\" is a delight from beginning to end. One clever, charming, or witty moment is quickly followed by another. The tone is strictly adult -- not unlike \\"Rocky & Bullwinkle\\". It's not a film aimed at children -- kids won't appreciate it. And -- partly because it's contemporary -- it never lapses into arch self-awareness. John Logan's literate script is a pleasure. (Note that Johnny Guitar's real name is Johnny Logan. Odd coincidence.)<br /><br />The character design and animation are superb -- the best I've seen in any CGI film. The high-definition transfer is magnificent, and given the nature of the material, the 3D version (which I haven't seen) is probably worth getting.<br /><br />Unhesitatingly recommended. It'll bore the kids, but adults will love it.
0345529057|5.0|These are great books, I found them very addictive and could not put them down. Despite totally enjoying the series on TV, as per usually can safely say that the books are so much better than the TV series. Defiantly worth the money and a great read, fully recommend!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazingly written! The creativity required is just incredible. I would recommend this book to anyone I could not put it down!
0756404738|5.0|Let me preface this review with a bit of a disclaimer:  I'm not a fantasy buff.  I can count the number of fantasy novels that I've read on one hand.  I haven't read Ursula Le Guinn, or Sanderson or Donaldson; however, I have no doubt this series by Rothfuss is just as good.  (This review is really a review of the first two novels, The Name of the Wind and A Wise Man's Fear.)    It's difficult to describe why I loved these book so much.  They're more than the sum of their parts.  The series has all of the polish that one would expect from a great author: the characters are rich and round, the story is well-paced and compelling and the magic system is believable, and ingeniously implemented.  And yet there is something special about the way the book comes together.  It sparkles and shines and and hypnotizes.  There are very few books that compel me to read into the early morning hours.  This book was one of them.     Now that I'm finished with A Wise Man's Fear, I feel empty and yearning for more.  It feels like a close friend has moved to a foreign country and I don't know when I'll see her again.  I suppose the only thing to be done is to wait for the third installment.
B004BBDHEK|3.0|This isn't the return of Yanni as you know him!    Yanni's last album, Voices, was a significant departure from his old self, and so is this album.  However, it actually has a lot in common with Voices.    Yanni's music has always been defined by melody first, and its propulsive energy second.  In Voices, Yanni's melodies disappeared; it's hard to even hear the original melodies in some songs that are based on old instrumental favorites.  Instead, the music became accompaniment for the singers.    In Truth of Touch, the music is largely similar to Voices: it sounds for all the world like some of the songs were intended as accompaniment for singers, but the songs never came together, and Yanni released them as instrumentals!    There is a strong melodic component to some of the tracks, but it's much less prominent than you might be used to -- not as strong as Ethnicity or other recent albums, and not even approaching the prominence of melody on early albums like Chameleon Days.  In some of the songs, the melodic component is relegated to flourishes and transitions as there is a chord change.    Rhythmically, the pieces have thumping electronica percussion running throughout, and a few of the tracks sound a lot like ambient/electronica artists such as Bluestone or Sleepthief.    So this is definitely not a return to the style of Ethnicity or If I Could Tell You.  It's another change of direction for Yanni: still recognizably Yanni, but not what we're used to.  In that sense, Yanni doesn't change a thing: change is the only constant for this ever-evolving artist.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase and was glad that it was brand new as stated by the seller.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I saw \\"Matilda\\" on TV last week,fell in love with it,so....I bought it! \\"Matty\\" is an adorable young lady with a super powered mind: maybe her IQ is over 500? Ms Perlman(\\"Carla\\" of \\"Cheers\\" fame) must have enjoyed playing the part of \\"Matty's\\" materialistic vain Mother. Pam Ferris should win an Oscar--she was absolutely BRILLANT(!!!!) as...I call her... \\"Madame 'Gestapo'\\"(a fitting title for her \\"over-the-top\\" mean-ness). \\"Matty's\\" teacher \\"Ms Honey\\" is as sweet as her name. And Mr. DeVito(of \\"Taxi\\" fame) does a masterful job of playing the \\"me/myself/and I\\" crooked Father and the narrater. What a sweet movie!   (P.S--I THOUGHT I recognized Paul Reubens(\\"Pee Wee Herman\\") as one of the FBI agents!)
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Mark Knopfler isn't just a great guitarist, he's a great songwriter.  He tells stories through lyrics, guitar, rhythm, and inflection.  He's one of the most tasteful musicians I've ever heard.  This album is much in the vein of his solo albums: introspective stories that sound like situations he's lived, but this time they're told through a duet of voices.  Emmylou Harris's voice blends seamlessly with Mark's, weaving together with the guitar and accompaniment to make each song complete in Mark's signature understated, the-truth-and-the-whole-truth way.
0553801473|3.0|I am one who has waited patiently, albeit with a little idea of what amy be happening with this entire series.<br />I truly enjoyed the first four books and put the story up there with best I have read in years and even compared it to Tolkien but that is past.<br /><br />I believe GRRM truly became tired of the story line becoming massive and deeply involved to a point where he just wanted to move on to other fresh ideas and story lines but a big paycheck from HBO came along and contract requiring the completion of the story. I suppose he could have come along and killed everyone off leaving Arya to conquer the world, the end, but the story continues at detailed nauseum and just drags you into another long wait for the next installment. I love a good story but you just cannot repeat episodes and character developement (food stores, Really!!!) and drag a story line on forever.<br /><br />I truly do not see an end in sight for these stories unless Martin hires ghost writers to help get the next books out there like Clancy did when he ran out of punch and ideas for his Dirk Pitt novels. I certainly hope I am wrong but I also expected book five out in short order, years ago!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|A very straight-forward device that gets the job done perfectly at a very nice price! This adapter makes it possible for me to use FireWire 400 equipped devices with my FireWire 800 equipped Mac computer. It works flawlessly, I might add. I am very happy with my purchase.
B004PCIBTQ|5.0|Includes all 13 songs on the US Deluxe Edition, both versions of \\"Tonight\\", \\"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\\" (a great song that's unavailable on any US version or on iTunes), and 2 remixes. I've never understood why the segregated sequencing. I love this album, but only after resequencing it.
1451629184|1.0|First of all let's get past the obligatory \\"OMG it's horrible what happened to that poor girl\\" because it is and we all know that 11 year old children are not prepared for what this girl went through, no one is.  But the topic of discussion is the merits of the book and sadly, there are few.  The publisher could have provided her with a ghost writer or at least an editor with the common sense to know that page after page of \\"I love my kitty and would give my life for my kitty\\" is just not that interesting.  It's like reading the ramblings of an eight year old.  I was hoping for a cohesive story that could explain how a woman is kept prisoner for 18 years in a back yard but instead this book gives us passages about one short lived cat after another, journal entries that are out of context and never fully explained, and huge gaps in time where apparently children grow up and all of a sudden someone rescues her, because heaven knows she did absolutely nothing to get herself rescued.  The pacing and timing in the book are bizarre and uneven with almost no reference to how old she is or the children are in a lot of instances.  I guess I was hoping for a more complete story than what was presented here. I wanted to know what the mother and step father were going through.  I wanted to know some more specific background on the mentally ill, sexually deviant pedophile, Phillip and Nancy as well. I wanted a more well rounded account of what happened to this girl but this is a childish, boring, unnecessarily long and tedious account of a woman's inexplicable acceptance of her fate at the hands of a crazy man.  Seriously, don't buy this book.
0316098329|5.0|Incredible book that I read through in one sitting.  Could not put it down.  The voice of the child narrator is incredible, and I believe realistic for a bright child who's been alone with a mother who has had nothing to do but tell him stories, read to him, and talk to him.  I agree with other reviewers that this novel is uplifting rather than depressing, although you might want to have some tissues handy.  This is an incredible story about the relationship of mother and child and the human ability to survive and recover from trauma and continue to love.      Some of the other reviewers did not like the book because of the subject matter or because of the naive narrator.  If you bothered to look at the description, you would have known both of those aspects before you started reading.  How about you fools reread Twilight and leave the literary fiction to the grownups?
B004LWZWEC|5.0|Another great DVD release from AC/DC.  This is a very special concert because Bon Scott is still alive.  He was the greatest singer of any rock band--don't get me wrong--Brian Johnson is also great--but Bon had that special voice and is really in tune with the band.  This is a old concert--Angus was basically a kid.  But wow--he can really play that SG.  He is a lot faster that he is today. Picture quality is great on Blu-Ray and the sound is also pretty good (not as good as River Plate or Donnington).<br />Buy this DVD!
0553801473|4.0|I fear I'll be too old to read the next installment as long as it takes him to write each one and he's no spring chicken. I enjoy his epic fantasy series except I've grown tired of the tedium of reading/learning names that will end up meaning nothing as the character will get killed off. Anyone you care about in the series is bound to die or wander off into a storyline with it's epic creation of weird names. I just wish Martin would focus and move the storyline forward a little quicker, the way it's written HBO will need to modify various storylines to maintain interest. Good book, but ultimately annoying in that nothing is really resolved and more people you care for are killed.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|AC/DC is still the best after all these years!  The venue is outstanding, the fans are crazy, and the music rocks!  I have been a fan of Angus for over 27 years and he still can play with the best- he is precise,entertaining, and energetic. There isn't one bad song on the entire disc, and the picture and sound quality are great.  I saw AC/DC live on this tour, and I can't decide which was better--this dvd or the concert in person..<br />If you like AC/DC then you MUST buy this.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|I've been waiting 28 years for this CD.  Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were my two favorite bands, so I was excited when this album was 1st relseased to see that Ian Gillan was their new singer.  The album was awesome and I got to see them in concert in 1983.  Gillan's performance on the old Sabbath songs were perhaps my favorite concert experience ever.  His screams and cackles just brought the songs to a new level.  I always wanted a live recording, but poor quality bootlegs were all that I could find.  Now after 28 years my ears are being treated to a excellent qulity recording with Gillan's vocal in top form.  My only disappointment was that Distrubing the Priest was on on the set list.  The sound quality of remastered studio album is a noticable improvement over the original, and I really like the addition of The Fallen.  Altogether an excellent double CD.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Once picked up, I couldn't put it down!    Excellent first book to what I believe will be an excellent series and I can't wait for the next one.    The battle scenes, particularly the climatic one near the end, left me literally breathless!
B0055FR5PS|4.0|Fun, moving, exciting, and actually pretty believable depiction of a marine platoon's reaction to an Independence Day type scenario; well worth the rental.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just finished the third book Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)on my Kindle! This book as for the first three were hard to put down! Totally enjoyed them! It was a great Trilogy to read! A definite must read for all ages! I can not wait till the movies to come out! The first movie \\"The Hunger Games\\" due out in March 2012! If you not read this yet... you have time! I only hope they follow the storyline and not butcher the movie up as they did in the movie Eragon!
0375842209|3.0|First off, I would like to say it was a good book. It was very difficult for me to put it down, I finished it quickly. One of the things I didn't enjoy, however, was how pretentious it seemed much of the time. This was in the style of writing and Death's narration. All of the    ***HEY IMA TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS NEXT***             AREN'T I SO POETIC?    stuff really bugged me. I mean, I'm oaky with the storyline itself being out of order, but not with the narrator telling me what's gonna happen to \\"soften the blow\\". The whole point of the book was to get to your feelings, which could've been done better without all the little snippets. At points it worked well, and in the end I really enjoyed this story, I'm just not a huge fan of the writing style.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I love this cd from the first time i heard this! Its something new and the sound from this cd is classic yes! It deserves 6 stars! And without Jon, unbelievable this is really great music!!
B004WESFZW|5.0|The movie is pretty much the opposite of what the trailers led you to belief. But in a good, it is full of twist and turns completely unexpected. It is a fantasy, romantic, action thriller. Not for everyone i guess but i enjoyed the movie from start to end.
B004O6YTWG|5.0|I was introduced to Mumford and Sons, a British folk group, by some friends about six months ago or so. Since then, I have listened to their music repeatedly. It is good quality both lyrically and musically. The group was nominated for a Grammy and performed on the stage there, as well. I bought the cd from Amazon.com and have not regretted my purchase. I look forward to hearing more from Mumford and Sons in the future!
B000067QMD|1.0|we bought this sealing discs to store the access milk in the refrigerator but i was surprised that they don't fit the avent bottles the i bought,so we ended up  throwing them in the trash,if u wanna store milk just use the plastic bags which are cheaper and more effective.
B000VJ271A|4.0|First, I'll probably make you angry with me, by saying I don't especially like the opera, Manon.  The reason is simply a matter of preference.  I like operas with well-written librettos that add something to the moments of beautiful singing.<br /><br />I've always felt the libretto for Manon is more than a little weak.  The characters vacillate too much, and often end up appearing too shallow or unthinking.  For example, Manon is a sweet innocent girl, but she abruptly goes along with a plot to have her lover (Villazon) kidnapped. She turns to life as a courtesan, but then remembers her love and wants to return to him.  She does, but then abruptly forgets the love in a lust for the riches that money can buy--and abruptly again, urges him to gamble so that she can again live the good life.<br /><br />OK.  You probably hate this review, because I have dared to express my personal dislike for weak story lines.  Maybe I can win you back, at least a bit, by saying that if you can enjoy what I consider a weak story line, this is maybe the best Manon ever recorded.  The costumes are beautiful, and this is even surpassed by the voluptuous singing of Dessay and Villazon.  They are simply incomparable!  Their acting also contributes a great deal and provides a really appealing look at \\"young love\\" and its struggle with \\"family issues\\" and the vices of life.  Yes, Samuel Ramey's voice is not what it once was, but it is still firm enough for this role, and he looks good too!<br /><br />I apologize if my remarks about weak story lines offended, but I can assure you that if you like Manon, this will be among the best Manons you've ever seen or heard!
B005D646RE|5.0|According to the series' promos, this will be the year Walt becomes the real force.  I don't doubt that.<br /><br />However, this amazing episode leads us into Season 4 seamlessly, and yet plays with every expectation we had from the adrenaline explosion that ended Season 3.  When the story stitches back together, with our pulses racing, we are treated to wonderful performances by the entire cast...yet again.  This episode takes Giancarlo Esposito (Gus) to an entirely new level of malevolence and shows us even more of who he really is.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot if you haven't seen it, but the key scene which sets up the rest of the season is so intense and explosive, that I, a person known for her calmness and ability not to show emotion, nearly jumped through the ceiling.  This one scene deserves an Emmy for a special category.<br /><br />I can hardly wait until Episode Two.  I watched this one three times, with the last viewing an hour ago to prepare me for tonight's presentation.<br /><br />There are two great dark dramadies on the air, Dexter and Breaking Bad.  Breaking Bad holds the edge, partly because every part of it is one degree of separation from the life of almost any one of us.  Every step of these people's dark paths is only one tragic circumstance away from any of our lives.<br /><br />Episode 1 tells me we will not be disappointed.  All I can say is that I will hope Walt's lung cancer stays in remission for many seasons to come.  Brilliant, thought-provoking, seamless production makes these people real.<br /><br />Lesson for Episode 1:  Don't make even the smallest mistake when you're dealing with Gus Frin!  Going back to the key scene: Watch each person closely!  Then rewind, go back and really watch, one-by-one, especially Mike!  I wish there were a higher word of praise than \\"masterpiece.\\"  This series is unique!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'll about I'm a but of a PvZ freak. I have it on my xbox, computer, and now my phone! I even have a PvZ shirt.  That said, this game is really addicting and has a good replay value. It's fun and challenging, and even has achievements. The only things I wish it had were the zen garden and the mini games that are available on the computer and xbox versions.
0375703764|4.0|This is a sometimes dark, sometimes deeply comical book. Some parts reminded me of another great read, Deborah Hersh is a Liar, though of course this one took much longer to read. If you've got a month to dedicate to something unique, this book is worth the time.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I love using this to amp up the way-too-quiet headphone outputs of the 3DS and PSP systems!  The largest improvement by far is when I plug it into the analog audio outputs of my PS3 and Xbox 360.  Wow!!  Even my iPhone music playback is improved. Great quality!
0375704027|5.0|Unlike some of Murakami's other work, Norwegian Wood is a tightly crafted, deeply moving piece of literature. The love triangle, and I mean \\"love,\\" that develops kept me up some nights. This summer Norwegian Wood and Deborah Hersh is a Liar are the only two books that affected me so much. I'm glad I came up this gem at last.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've been using this headset for 4 months and I can say this is truly a great headset. It is really comfortable and I rarely have any problems with it. The battery life is very good as I can play hours and hours before the need to recharge. The range is also quite good, I am able to go almost everywhere downstairs without it disconnecting(my headset adapter is upstairs.) The 7.1 sounds great when playing games and it's surprisingly good while listening to music. The only issue is that the microphone is advertised as noise-cancelling, but this feature is only available when the voice masking feature is on. The microphone will pick up minor noises, but overall it's clear. I would recommend this product if your into gaming or just want a good wireless headset.    Pros  - Wireless Range  - Sound Quality  - Battery Life  - Rechargeable while in use  - Comfortable  - Able to program buttons on headphones to any key you want  - Durable  Cons  - Microphone isn't noise cancelling as of right now  - Ears get a bit hot after long sessions
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|The story is clever and the script is as good as any Baldacci or Cussler novel.    All of the actors were fun to watch in their roles--the kind of movie that gets better and better the more times you see it.  And the Director's Commentary is almost as good as the main show!    It's a stretch to think that the Scotland Yard can do its recovery and analysis of the burned document in only a few minutes' time and then quickly dispatch Parisian agents on-site to the intended subway station, but sure, it's good entertainment.     The sweeping aerial views of Venice are so beautiful that you can stop-action-them on your wall-mount tv and it's like having a masterpiece painting in the room!  The beauty of the costuming and party scenes and fine dining scenes are like the director is giving us an artistic gift beyond the yarn of the piece.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|its a pretty cool game just hate all the updates. combine the elements to make new ones a simple concept just makes me want to find all possible combinations.
0307477479|3.0|I have to say that I was disappointed in this novel.  It reminded me of Jonathan Franzen's freedom in terms of writing style, the satire, the setting, the themes, but it was no where near as good.  I am frankly surprised that it won the Pulitzer and all I can think is that it was a political decision...had to give it to a woman?  Had to NOT give it to Franzen (because he's a man?).  I don't know.  This book was a light summer read--enjoyable but very forgettable.
0061784788|5.0|for readers that have read James Rollins the Devil Colony is probably his best novel ..He brings historical america and modern day technology together in a gripping tale you cant put down..The ancient lore of our american Indians and others before them and how they mixed with our nations forefathers and come to play in modern science That can be the destruction of life as we know it..<br /><br />As the tale unfolds it grips you and there is no line between fact of fiction that you can fathom..in fact it makes you want to do some research of your own into the subject..Like always the author gives you many of those references<br /><br />All in all it is well written and moves so fast you keep reading to see what is next..Reminds me of the speed of the Devinci Code
B000SE0OYA|5.0|I use these cartridges in my Brother MFC-9840cdw and they are wonderful.  I bought them about 6 months ago when my original cartridges were running low, but only now needed to put them in...and I am not disappointed.  Very easy to install (aren't all, though?), and the color/quality seems to be identical to the name brand Brother cartridges.  I would and will buy them again, and recommend them to everyone.    The seller did have an inventory issue with one of the cartridges (can't remember exactly which one now) but emailed me directly to explain the situation.  They kept in constant contact with me throughout the process and even had their parent company (the actual producer of the cartridge, I believe) send the item straight to me with no additional cost, vice waiting for the inventory to get to their facilities and then sending it to me.    So, on top of a great product, the customer service is top not!  Buy and be satisfied!!!
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Hypatia and the intellectual climate at Alexandria of her time has gone largely ignored by ancient historians, and although the manner in which elements in the film may not be historically perfect, the fact that the decision to make such such a film is justifiable in itself. It at least gives a hint of what the historical character was all about.    So make a point of obtaining this great movie and in conjuction, read M. Dzielska's biography \\"Hypatia of Alexandria\\".    Janse Standt (NYC)
0553801473|4.0|With each successive book the world of Ice and Fire has gotten bigger and bigger, piling on more subplots, locations and characters. In this fifth book, A Dance With Dragons, the world has almost become too big. We spend so much time on all these side characters and subplots that the main story doesn't seem to advance much. That isn't to say it is a bad book, on the contrary, the sideplots and subplots add a lot of background and depth to this epic world that we all love so much. But for those of us that have been waiting a decade + for a resolution to this story... well, it just doesn't feel like we are getting anywhere fast. I love this series as a whole and will continue reading it until it is through, but I hope for the next two books George \\"Ray-Ray\\" Martin will cut some of these subplots and extraneous characters and get back to the more streamlined storytelling of the first two books.<br /><br />This sounds like a negative review, but really it isn't, cause even if this is one of the weaker books in the series, it is still better than any fantasy book I have read since the last Ice and Fire novel.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|But I love it.    This album has layers.  Listen to it with headphones on and you will see that the complexity of this album is in its subtlety.  It's simply beautiful music that has layers and layers upon each other.  Those that complain of the lack of Kilmore or Mike are not looking at the landscape that they set for the music that is portrayed in this album.  It's beautiful, symbolic, powerful.  I love it.    The only gripe that I have about this album is that they should have included all of the B-sides.  They are vintage Incubus and are absolutely amazing.  Take this CD and add \\"Surface to Air\\" (one of my favorite Incubus songs period), \\"Rebel Girls\\", and \\"Hold Me Down\\", and nobody complains about this album because it would have had a balance between melody and rock.    Listen to it with headphones.  Seriously.  And then get the B-sides.  You'll realize that Incubus still owns every other band out there.

There is a community concern about the drought which is controlled by Urban renewal.  True Love blossoms in the heat between violent action of gun fights and escape.  Jake \\"The Snake\\" evens matters and salutes Rango with a tip of the Hat.  Two True Legends of the West.  This is highly recommended for age 4 to 12.
0553801473|3.0|A big buzz kill is the best way to describe this book. Like most fans of the series I am plot invested at this point...or at least was. But even though it was nice reading about favorite old characters again... not enough HAPPENS in this book to keep things going like they should. Martin is just milking the story for every dollar he can get now, knowing that so many of us fans of the earlier books will buy almost anything at this point. These last two installments should have been just one, like originally planned. The story has bogged down, and I'm sure I care to wait another 5 years for the next book. After being so pleased with the first 3 books that is really sad to have to say.
0375703764|2.0|*sigh* Full disclosure: I made it exactly 361 pages (out of the total 662) before giving up on this book. Can't say I didn't try, right?    As others have mentioned, House of Leaves is a story within a story within a story. First, there's the story of this mysterious house that is bigger on the inside than the outside. This story is told in the form of an in-depth analysis of a documentary produced about the house. Basically, the manuscript of this analysis re-tells what happens in the documentary, scene by scene, stopping frequently to examine the deeper meaning of the documentary from every angle imaginable, often going off on tangents about Greek mythology, psychology, etc, with hundreds of footnotes citing other writers' own analysis of the film. If the book stopped here, I would be giving it a higher rating. The story of the house was spooky and captivating. It would make for a great horror flick, perhaps in the style of Paranormal Activity combined with the Blair Witch Project.    Unfortunately, the author adds another layer to the story by telling it through the thoughts of a druggie tattoo-parlor employee who finds this manuscript and is reading it for himself. As he reads the manuscript of the analysis of the documentary of this house *sigh again*, he begins to go a little crazy, believing that his own apartment is changing shape with its own monster that wants to eat him. As he is reading this manuscript, he adds his own footnotes, giving his own thoughts about what the manuscript author has written, or sometimes just writing whatever happens to pop into his head. I tell you, these footnotes drove me bonkers and ultimately ruined the book for me. This character's footnotes often consist literally of page upon page of run-on, stream-of-consciousness sentences. Here's an example:    \\"It doesn't matter that she always gives me a wink and sometimes even a full throated laugh when I call her \\"Thumper\\", \\"Hi Thumper\\" \\"Bye Thumper\\" the only words I can really muster, she still really only exists for me as a strange mixture of daydream and present day edge, by which I mean something without a past or a future, an icon or idyll of sorts, for some reason forbidding to me, but seductive beyond belief and probably relief, her image feeling permanently fixed within me, but not new, more like it's been there all along, even if I know that's not true, and come last night going so far as to entwine, entangle and finally completely replace her with the (-can't write the word-) of-\\"    So... if that sounds like good reading to you, then be my guest and buy this book.    Finally, there is a group of \\"editors\\" that occasionally add their own footnotes to the whole thing. So there are footnotes by a total of three authors, each with their own font so you can tell who's who. The bulk of this book is footnotes. Seriously. Many of these footnotes span multiple pages, some are written upside down, sideways, or in reverse (so they must be viewed through a mirror), some don't even start on the same page that directed you to them, some footnotes start on a later page and you must flip backwards through the pages to read them, and then there are the footnotes that have their own footnotes. \\"Dear Sweet Jesus, when will it end?\\" is all I could think while reading this book. Some reviewers found this \\"style\\" to be novel and entertaining. I felt like I was going crazy, just like the character. Maybe that was the point? Although making me go crazy with boredom failed miserably in getting me to enjoy this story.    By the time I reached the half-way point of the book, I couldn't believe that the author actually had more to say. It seemed as if the spooky story of the shifting house was over, yet there was still half a book left! Perhaps if I had kept reading, things would have drastically improved - but I doubt it. The creepy story of the house deserves five stars. The bulk of the book deserves zero.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Kind of basic but its fun for the, kids because they have multiple options so the car ride doesn't have to be angrily loud
B00005LC4Z|5.0|Loved the movie, it's funny, serious, and down right good. Tom Hanks is excellent in it and I've always loved Sally Field. An enjoyable movie for the whole family.
