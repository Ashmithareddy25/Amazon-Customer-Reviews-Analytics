0792151712|2.0|This is one of the most overrated movies of all time.  The plot goes at a snail's pace, filled with little romantic quips and cliches.  The first two hours of the movie are completely unnecessary.  By the time anything exciting happens, you don't care.  Titanic was a good idea, but failed in it's execution.  Just another Hollywood hype.
B000001DV2|5.0|The masters of commercial hard rock are Def Leppard, and with this album they somehow manage to be at once more pop and more rock than they were on the previous release, Hysteria. It's heavier and louder than Hysteria, but it's slicker, and the songs here, with one exception, are pop ditties with all the big choruses and catchiness you'd expect from Leppard. With more straight power chords and crunching guitars than before, Def Leppard neatly pull the stunt of producing an album of hard rocking pop songs.<br />Showcased here, more than ever before, is the band's sense of humour. Tunes like \\"Make Love Like a Man\\", \\"Personal Property\\", and \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" are often accused of cheesiness but critics fail to see that this is exactly the point. The chauvinism of such pieces is tongue-in-cheek, as much mocking those who right similar songs in all seriousness as much as anything else.<br />Let's Get Rocked was one of the band's biggest UK hits and to this day graces the band's encore in the live show. It has more overdubs than you could shake your big-haired wig at, Hysteria-style, but this song wouldn't really have gone on Hysteria; it's an evolution of that sound. Heaven Is, meanwhile, has a similar feel to a harder-rocking \\"Animal\\". \\"Make Love Like a Man\\", aside from being a very funny track, is also among the best things the band has done.<br />The album covers the bases - lighter pop rockers, louder rockers, a dark-sounding ballad in \\"Tonight\\" and a more romantic one in \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\". The icing on the cake here is the most addictive mid-tempo anthem they've done, \\"I Wanna Touch U\\", and the long and dark \\"White Lightning\\".<br />Absolutely the dog's..... Well, anyway, yep, this is my favourite Leppard album. Although the highlights are even higher on &quot;Euphoria&quot;, this album is a stronger all-rounder to take the tape as my favourite Leppard album. This is better than Hysteria, so there.
6305627347|2.0|Back in the day, I was a South Park fan.  I really wanted to see this movie.  South Park was a total waste of time.  It's filled with jokes you've seen on the TV show and filler space musical numbers.  I was bored to tears.  However, it gets two stars since you'll be repeating all the phrases and lines.  I hated the movie, but still coin the sayings of the film.
6301793196|5.0|This concert, along with the Rome concert, were the two best the Tenors have ever done. The Tenors all seemed to be at the same level, in terms of sweetness, and richness. However, there was one clear standout. Luciano Pavarotti, with his good ear,  makes him absolutely phenomenal, and he is always in tune, with all the right notes at all the right times. All his arias were outstanding, but the one that most impressed me was Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's &quot;Turandot&quot;. His pronunciation was perfect, (no wonder, he's Italian) and the singing was beautiful. Carreras sang Granada very well, with pretty good pronunciation, and a sweet tone. Domingo did an excellent job singing, &quot;No puede ser&quot;. The he puts the notes with the words is just great. The orchestra of two-hundred, under the command of Zubin Metha was excellent. If there was such a thing as &quot;6-star&quot; rating, this video would get it.
1559409002|1.0|Just because a movie is made for 35,000 dollars and is independent does not make it good.  This is a truly dire film, proceeding at a snail's pace with acting so wooden I was looking for termites.  On the mini documentary the cast seem as bemused at the renewed interest in the film as anyone else, and even one of the reviewers was quoted as saying &quot;uh, very slow, not one of my favourite films&quot;.  I did a film degree and, trust me, this film has almsot no redemming features.  Save your money.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Not only is Rocky Horror Picture Show one of the best movies/Rock Operas of all time, but it also has the best DVD features I've ever seen. In this 25th Anniversay Edition, you get a DVD Rom with interviews, music videos, a VH1 Pop-Up Video, Outtakes, Cast Bios, and much much more. If you're going to buy this movie, get it on DVD, it's worth every penny!
0780626966|5.0|This Nightmare On Elm Street Collection is Amazing! I own both the DVD Collection and VHS Collection. The DVD set is way better due to the many extras found on the bonus disc titled The Nightmare Encyclopedia which has all 7 Movie Previews that were shown in theatres, it also has Music Videos including DOKKEN's &quot;Dream Warriors&quot;. It has a interactive game called The Labyrinth which is very hard, if you have a DVD-Rom you get even more extras like all 7 Screenplays and an interactive Freddy that haunts your PC courtesy of Togglethis.com. What can I say you get so much more! All the Movies are in the best Quality ever with the exception of the bad film transfer of Nightmare 2! As far as my personal review of each film I give Nightmare 1 five stars, Nightmare 2 two stars, Nightmare 3 five stars, Nightmare 4 four stars, Nightmare 5 two stars, Nightmare 6 two stars, and than Nightmare 7 Wes Cravens New Nightmare five stars. I have to also say NANCY who is played by Heather Langenkamp brought this whole collection to life with her roles in Nightmare 1, Nightmare 3, and Wes Cravens new Nightmare. Without NANCY who we were all so familiar with from the start, this collection would not be so Good. I also give a big thanks to Wes Craven for taking the laughs out of Freddy and taking him back to what he was in the original Nightmare 1, a Horror Icon not a comedian! I highly encourage anyone to buy this collection! The DVD set is truly amazing for any Nightmare On Elm Street fan!
0679809015|5.0|Our copy's gone through two kids, and I need to get another for #3 on the way because it's been so well loved by the first two.  It was the absolute favorite of both my son and daughter.  Highly recommend!
B00000J7JO|5.0|I heard the opening tracks and was amazed.  Californication, Scar Tissue, Parallel Universe and Around the World are instant classics.  The whole album is good.  Destine to be one the the best all-time.  It even turned my father (oldies type) on to them.  They are so much better than any of todays new crap-rock band (e.g. limp bizkit (Durst's unit) or Papa Croach).  On of the best.  Keep up the great work!
B00005221L|1.0|I do not know what Fox Home Entertainment is doing here, but I  recently replaced my previous DVD version of this film, hoping the DTS would enhance my viewing experience.  The transfer has major grain on it, and the brightness and resolution is nowhere near the quality of the original DVD.  Stick with the Dolby Digital copy. -bad move Fox.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Rob Reiner is really one of our great directors.  Recently, he has made some, well, to be kind, not so good films.  But (along with WHMS) this man gave us Stand By Me.  I thank him and other for putting together this special DVD.<br />When this movie came out in 1986, I was the same age as the boys in the film.  I was excited to see it when my parents rented it and for some reason I'll never forget this: I was grounded the night my parents were to watch it.  I was banished to my room (where I listened to the oldies station ironically).  I was sad, but moved on to summer camp and life...I rented some time later and liked it.  Then, for some stupid reason, I forgot about the movie.<br />It wasn't until the holiday season and with my new DVD player keeping me warm, that I decided to revisit this classic.  Watching it (and the commentary and the really touching documentary--much better than the usual junk they slap together) touched me very deeply.  This film contains moments from your life.  It will move you.  It captures so perfectly exactly what that time is like.  It is a treasure.  I can't think of many other movies or TV shows (except the Wonder Years) that really gets what it is like to be a kid of that age.  There are no super smart kids here.  There are stupid adults.  Just real emotion.  It takes it place among my favorite works.  A real and true masterpiece.  I thank Stephen King, Rob Reiner, Richard Dreyfuss, for their honesty, pain, and truth.  .
B000002V1D|5.0|I too, was a big fan of Duran Duran around the time of Ragged Tiger.  Then they got stupid with Notorious and I lost interest.  With this effort they showed real maturity.  My favorite cut is &quot;Too Much Information&quot;; awesome lyrics.  &quot;Destroyed by MTV---I hate to bite the hand that feeds me&quot;---can Simon LeBon sing any truer words?
B00004ZAV3|5.0|How can you beat an album with 27 #1 songs all by the same group? No other act could make such an album.
B00003CX8J|4.0|I just want to say I went out and got this movie not once, but twice. The first time I bought this movie I took it home, opened it up, and had a hell of a time being careful to remove the DVD from the casing. Whereas most DVD casing has a button you can press to safely the remove the DVD without risk of bending the delicate structure of the disc, this one does not. It's like an ordinary cd case which requires some degree of pulling, but this DVD would not budge with a delicate tug. As a result, the DVD was bent a little and the result was video fragmentation during the first viewing. <br />I returned X-Men and got a replacement, this time being extra careful to remove the DVD. The first viewing went smoothly, so did the second, but the third?? Well, after I had another mishap of removing the DVD from the casing, I got more fragmentation, albeit was a little less than before. It only occured during one scene. <br />Now I enjoyed X-Men, I liked the movie a lot, and that's why I bought it. But FOX gets an F on the DVD casing, a horrible design that can do more harm than good. You're better off removing the DVD and leaving it on your stereo for months than putting it back in the case, seriously.
0451167716|5.0|This was by far one of the best books I have ever read. I am a avid reader and of all the books ive read this has to be in the top 5. I highly reccomend this book. -Eric Ahlport
0679746048|5.0|The book is a short and easy read of 168 pages (approx) with various photocopies of hospital forms inbetween the pages of medium sized text. It's a memoir about Susanna Kaysen's journey into a hostpial-a sychiatric hospital called McLean Hospital. And if I were to note that people such as Sylvia Plath and James Taylor were also clients at the same hospital it may interest you to see the colorful aray of incidents that happen at the hospital that although very serious, Ms. Kaysen seems to put in a highly amusing manner.<br /> The book is at a level course of happenings and chapters even though it's set in a hospital that it makes you realise that the life inside the white walls of the hospital are practically the same as life in the outside world-just surprisingly more...safer and confined.<br />Susanna Kaysen has been able to put her words on paper so honestly and ingeniously that I'm sure that anyone with a spare afternoon will surely enjoy reading it as well as those who have a disorder of some sort (like myself) who will easily be able to see a whole new side of humor.<br />You want to know what I think honestly? This is one book you won't regret reading.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This C.D. really shows how much Green Day has grown up. They still have a great sound, even if it has lost a little of it's harshness. Still the songs are great, a C.D. you can listen to as much as you want and not get bored.
B00003ZKVP|5.0|I'm convinced that the reason this CD is not considered one of HAWKWIND's best is that it has been so hard to come by.  Before purchasing my CD, the last time I had heard this album was in 1979.  It was one of a number of HAWKWIND disks on the premises at the time and had been purchased from a British collection at a used record store.  It was considered rare back then!  This disk contains the type of music that made HAWKWIND famous!  Many of the songs on this disk have seen wide release on badly-mastered &quot;Best-of's&quot; and live albums; this does not do them justice.  Trust me - the original studio master sounds great!

6305358613|5.0|Beautifully filmed epic film with gorgeous locations - check out those authentic castles!  Pretty accurate as history goes but not totally.  I believe Liz had a relationship of sorts with Dudley until his death. Also Mary was known for her great beauty(granddaughter of Queen Isabela of Spain with jet black hair &amp; blue eyes).  Why she is depicted as such a TROLL is a mystery even if she was at death's door!  PS - check out TROLL # 2 - Mary's fool!  Cast is all excellent particularly Joe Fiennes in another sensitive performance &amp; Vincent Cassel as a different kind of queen - a bit more flaming then Liz! DVD quality is tops - pic &amp; sound.  Some good extras as well.
0060273224|5.0|I haven't read this book in a long time and actually, I couldn't find it either.  I happened to stumble across the title on amazon and now I'm going to have to reread it, but I'll review it quickly anyway.  I liked this book because it was original and unique.  The idea of the Abhorsen and what he does and the demon-cat Mogget particularly fascinated me.  Sabriel was a wonderful character; I found her realistic and easy to love.  This is definitely a must-read.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Beautiful film about forbidden love wonderfully played by Joe &amp; Gwyne. Excellent DVD quality,both picture &amp; sound. Lovely musical score. Shell out the extra bucks for the collector's edition to see 30 min. featurette &amp; a few deleted scenes - but really these extras should be included in the cheaper version - we call that GREED.PS - where was Joe's nomination/award - he was supreme!!
0679879269|4.0|The four stars I give this book result from splitting the difference between the five stars I give it for storytelling and the three for philosophy.  Yes, the writing is beautiful, the characters engaging, the ending a classic tear-jerker.  But I have a pretty basic problem with Pullman's blaming God for the things that human beings have done in his name.<br />As it happens, I share a lot of Pullman's world-view; secular-humanist, deist, and very skeptical of any type of religious fundamentalism.  As some other reviewers have rightly noted, however, Pullman is so busy attacking the Christian religion, and Catholicism in particular, that he never seems to notice there are other religions around.  Sikhs and Hindus have been blowing eachother up, assassinating eachother's leaders and vandalizing eachother's holy places for years, without invoking the Book of Revelation to justify it.  For that matter, many secular philosophies, notably including both Communism and laissez-faire capitalism, have been used by their true believers to justify suppression of knowledge, persecution of unbelievers, and brutal exploitation of the weak.<br />That said, however, I strongly recommend this book to everyone, whether you are likely to agree with Pullman's theology and philosophy or not.  Unlike some of Pullman's critics, I do not believe that exposure to deliberately iconoclastic ideas will lead you down the primrose path to Hell; if God gave you consciousness and free will, he also gave you the critical judgment to examine a variety of ideas without fear and decide whether or not to agree with them.  Fundamentalist parents will undoubtedly forbid their children to read this book (thereby, of course, giving it the glamorous allure of the forbidden), but I don't think the &quot;Dark Materials&quot; trilogy will undermine the religious training of any reasonably intelligent teenager.  Reading a book that challenges them to think as well as to be entertained, however, and to consider the big issues it raises, will do them a great deal of good.
0393317552|3.0|Jered Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel essentially argues that geography rather than social influences is the primary determining factor in the development of conquoring civilizations. Europe and Asia, Jared maintains, have a geographical edge over civilizations that developed elsewhere because these continents have a &quot;horizontal orientaiton of axes&quot; - that is to say long, broad stretches of land in various climates rather than thin, narrow axes of climates as are found in the Americas and Africa. These axes, Diamond argues created &quot;proximate factors&quot; (more domesticable animals, greater variety of food sources for example) that in turn allowed civilizations to conquor other peoples - and eventually conquor the civilizations on other continents in turn. A final critical contributing factor resulting from the orientation of axes is the susceptability and ease of the spread of disease, a factor that was undeniably a factor in the conquest of the New World.<br />At first glance, Diamond's argument seems unrefutable.  In fact when I was reading this book I was reminded of Darwin's Orgins of Species.  Indeed, he makes a good case for his position.  However, further examination raises questions.  For example, what of cultural influences?  I find it interesting that the eventual &quot;conquest&quot; of the world is almost exclusivley the result of European efforts - including the subjugation of Asia, which acording to Diamond shares the same developmental axis of Europe. Why is it that only Europe &quot;conquored&quot; the globe and not both Europe and Asia? Or why was it not Asia who eventually conquored and subjugated the Americas and Africa? What about the role of religion? Certainly a driving factor in the explosive European colonization of the world was Christianity. What of other cultural factors like competition?  In many cultures cooperation and group cohesiveness and unity is stressed rather than personal gain (in Asia as well as in the Americas.)  Yet none of these cultural mores are even mentioned in the book.<br />Diamond's argument has its merits - certainly geography has played a role in the eventual conquest of one civilization over others.  However, I believe the impact of culture, religion and weltanschauuing - one's world view - play a larger role than is given credit for. Guns, Germs and Steel is certainly an intriguing book, and is not without its strengths. However I cannot help but feel that the development of mankind is greater than mere geographic happenstance.)

B00003CWTH|4.0|Okay, so this movie is definitely NOT for everyone. But speaking strictly for myself, I thought it was extraordinarily moving and poignant.  I thought the pacing and direction were great, I like the way all the characters start off in a kind of complacent, daily routine, but one by one, something happens that changes them, building up to the climax at the end.  I particularly thought Tom Cruises role was riveting, and I'm not trying to be a loser Tom Cruises jock sniffer, I just really loved the way he was such a chauvnistice pig up until the interviewer asks him about his mom and dad, and from that moment on, it seems like his entire world falls apart, and the scene with Jason Robards was awesome.  I was also captivated by the basic themes of the film, it seems to be redemption, forgiveness, and defiance.  Of course, it had it's flaws. I thought in was one of those movies where everyone is connected to eachother in some way, sort of like Playing By Heart, or about any Sienfeld episode. But it's not quite that interconnected, although there is something that connects one to another to another, but not something connecting all of them to all of them.  All in all though, I really was moved. I'd hate to recommend it to people that may not like it, but all I'm saying is that if you like really &quot;deep&quot; films, or stellar acting, or both, then you should definitely check  this out.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd is one of the best PFloyd cd's there is. I recently got it for Christmas... and have already memorized most of the songs. I think all PFloyd fans should have this cd. It's combinations of music and various sound effects are astounding.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This album rocks, this album is hot.  Of course, this all is my opinion but I think &quot;Play,&quot; by Moby, is probably the best CD I've bought sense Nine Inch Nails' &quot;The Fragile;&quot; and if I excluded NIN's amazing follow up to The Downward Spiral I'd say Play is the best album I've heard, and bought in the last five, maybe seven years.  Not only does the music on this disc come together as an intriguing, effecting, cool whole, but each song itself stands as an individual masterpiece in the quality of it's uniqueness, it's versatility.  And not only does each song lack the imitation of it's proceeder, but each song fits into the massive whole with a different combination, always placing it one step above the next.  This album literally gets better with every song; and separately, each song gets better with the audible viewing of the one ahead of it.  The song, &quot;My Weakness&quot; is truly heavenly, and sounds as if the ocean is singing to you.  Play, by Moby, is highly recommended by me.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Radiohead mainly because they are not a boring band with poppy songs in which every album is exactly the same. At least there is a band out there with enough guts to try something new and lead us into the next century. I am an aspiring producer/engineer and I believe this album wa brilliantly put together with pro tools and such. I sit and listen to the actual construction and am amazed! Anyone who thinks this album is a waste should sit and have a nice cup of coffee because obviously you know nothing about quality music.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This cd rocked my vote because..well...it's Britney! She matured in this cd.  <br />1) Oops i did it again - Like her last cd, britney always makes a video out of her first track on the song. Baby one more time, and oops i did it again, both have very unique titles, the difference? Baby one more time talks about britney missing a boy, oops i did it again talks about britney breaking a boy's heart, see the difference? 5/5<br />2) Stronger - This song is great because she uses the line (My loneliness ain't killin' me no more) which if u remember in baby one more time, she used, (My loneliness/is killing me now) which i think is very cool. This fast paced song also uses techno whirls and whizzes. 5/5<br />3) Don't Go Knockin' on my door - Talks about how the boy that britney used to like can't come back around and better stay away. Fast paced and catchy. 5/5<br />4) (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - This is my favorite song on the cd because anyone who can remake a song that sucks, and have you singing it is a genious. (When i'm drivin' in my car/and that man comes on the radio/he's telling me more and more/about some useless information) 5/5<br />5) Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - This song was written by country's favorite, Shania Twain, and given to Britney to sing, which by the way is sung beautifully. About - A boy is telling everyone else but Britney about how they are perfect together, and they make the best couple, but he never tells Britney. 5/5<br />6) What u see (is what u get) - This song is fast paced. About - Excepting britney for who she is. (This is me/hey u/if u want me don't forget/u should take/me as i am/cause i can promise u/baby what u see is what u get) 5/5<br />7) Lucky - Mid paced - About - a girl is rich, but remember the old saying, money can't buy love. I like this song because it puts me to sleep because it is so dreamy and beautifully sung. 5/5<br />8) One kiss from u - Fast paced - i think the title tells the story about the song. This song is okay, but not great. 3/5<br />9) Where are u now - Slow song - Britney is wondering where the boy she likes is. 3/5<br />10) Can't Make U Love Me - Fast paced and catchy. Talks about how britney can't convince someone to love her, because she is just another girl with a crush on a boy. That should be a lesson to all jealous teeny boopers. 5/5<br />11) When your eyes say it - I don't really like this song. 3/5<br />12) Dear Diary - This song is pretty, but it could've stood some more beats. Britney wrote this! 4/5
B00004XOWM|5.0|WHEN I GOT THE CD I WAS EXPECTING THE MOST, AND I SURELY GOT IT.  EVERY SONG HAS A MEANING BEHIND IT AND SOME ARE REAL DEEP TOO.  TO ANYONE THAT THINKS THIS IS CRAP, YOU NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MUSIC AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS MORE TO MUSIC THAN THE LYRICS.  YEAH, THEY MIGHT BE A LITTLE VOLGURE, BUT THAT IS HOW FRED EXPRESSES HIMSELF.  GET OVER IT.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THAN SELL IT TO SOMEONE WHO WILL APPRECIATE IT.  AS FOR LIMP BIZKIT AS A WHOLE, THEY ALL ROCK IN THEIR OWN LITTLE WAY.  GIVE THEM PROPS BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT TO THE FULLEST.  I LOVE YOU LIMP BIZKIT AND WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR NUMBER 1 SUPPORTER.

0140186409|5.0|&#34;The Grapes of Wrath,&#34; written in 1939 by John Steinbeck, is a book about the Great Depression, and one poor sharecropper family's struggle to survive the worst deprivations that American society in the 1930's had to offer. Indeed, perhaps no American work of fiction fits the label of &#34;The Great American Novel&#34; better than Steinbeck's wonderfully written and still highly controversial masterpiece of fiction.<br /><br />Set in the 1930's, in America's &#34;Dust Bowl,&#34; this is the tale of the Joad family, a large clan of poor Oklahoma sharecroppers, and how they are forced into a decision to migrate to California. It's also the story of the many trials and sufferings that they endure during their long and harrowing journey.<br /><br />Forces of nature and the forces of economics have conspired to force the Joads off their farms. So, this proud, hard-working family, sells most of their worldly possessions in order to buy a run-down old jalopy. The whole family - Ma and Pa; Granma and Granpa; Tom (the oldest son, and an ex-convict recently paroled from prison); Al (Tom's younger brother); Uncle John (Pa's brother); Ruthie and Winfield (Ma and Pa's youngest children); the heavily pregnant Rose of Sharon (Tom's younger sister) and her husband Connie; and the Reverend Jim Casy (a family &#34;friend&#34;) - pack themselves, along with their essential goods, aboard their decrepit old vehicle, and depart for the &#34;promised land&#34; on America's west coast.<br /><br />The vast majority of this compelling novel tells the story of the Joads' plight while on the road. They are almost immediately confronted with the death of a loved one. This compounds their grief at the loss of their home and possessions. They find that most people they meet along the way despise, reject, and vilify them as dirty, filthy &#34;Okies;&#34; they receive aid and comfort from very few along their route. Yet, they remain undaunted; throughout their struggles, they remain focused on the ultimate realization of a dream: jobs, high pay, and a new life in California.<br /><br />The great climax of &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; sees the Joads once again suffering in unspeakable squalor as they attempt to survive the violent forces of nature and humanity in this, the great western &#34;promised land.&#34;<br /><br />The basic plot of &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; is exciting, suspenseful, gripping, and possessed with a terrible beauty. It is written perhaps in the finest traditions of the early twentieth century &#34;muckraking&#34; novels, exposing, as it does, the worst societal ills that were prevalent in American society of the 1930's.<br /><br />This book serves as Steinbeck's soapbox, as he deplores the exploitation of California's migrant workers during this era. Indeed, the author is frequently barely able to contain his moral outrage at the sufferings of thousands of &#34;Okies,&#34; and their often violent treatment by landowners, businessmen, and even law enforcement officials.<br /><br />&#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; abounds with wonderful character studies. The effects of indescribable suffering and abject poverty give Ma Joad the steel to evolve from her traditional role as a silent, obedient wife to become the true leader of the family. Conversely, Pa Joad's traditional role seems to diminish; he recognizes the fact, and, after only brief resistance, he defers to his wife's new role. Tom, ever so careful not to do anything to jeopardize his parole at the outset, finds himself increasingly outraged at his family's plight, and emboldened to action as a result.<br /><br />This novel's central theme is still as relevant today as it was in 1939: the growing disparity between the &#34;haves&#34; - the rich - and the &#34;have nots&#34; - the poor. Perhaps this is the real reason why the book still generates such controversy. It holds a mirror up to us, and forces us to confront some unpleasant truths that we, as an &#34;enlightened&#34;society, would rather not face. And that, in itself, makes this brilliant book well worth reading.society, would rather not face. And that, in itself, makes this brilliant book well worth reading.
0195800036|4.0|This dictionary is based on Mr. Hornby's effort aiming to help foreign students overcome difficulties in studying English. Both English and Chinese explainations are well provided, which is good for people like me whose thinkings often rely on Chinese. If you want to become a English language expert and look forward to speak English better than most of native English people do, you might think of spending a lot of your time on refering to this dictionary. But if you want to just pick up the language in a shorter time and don't need to express everything precisely like a old pedant, other sources of help might be more effective. Overall this dictionary is quite versatile. If you have just enough money to buy one dictionary, this is a not bad choice.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Thats all I can say about this CD.  There is no artist that comes close to doing what Dido does.  This CD offers the theme from the WB's series, Roswell.  And there is a whole lot more great music on here.  It offers something for everybody.

Personally I feel Look Sharp is the best of Roxette. Roxette are good for their early works and became affected in late songs, whcih is made obvious in &quot;Crash, Boom, Bang&quot;. My favourite songs of Roxette are &quot;Fading like a flower&quot;, &quot;It must have been love&quot;and &quot;listen to your heart&quot;.

0517209764|5.0|Shakespeare's works are quite engaging.  Like all great writers he wrote of &quot;the heart in conflict with itself.&quot;  It is hard to go wrong reading Shakespeare... Okay, now I'm laughing.  The very idea of a review of Shakespeare is just funny for some reason.  You can't review Shakespeare.  And the &quot;how many stars?&quot; thing-- come on.  This is Shakespeare we're talking about here. In other news, be sure and read &quot;Castle of Wisdom.&quot;  If you like Shakespeare, you'll totally dig it.
079284209X|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is by far the best English movie of this genre. Attactive storyline and decent acting makes it so much better than those trying to be &quot;cool&quot; but eventually become stupid (One typical example: Mission Impossible 2). I am particularly impressed by the style the movie presents: desolation in turbulent lives, which make the movie excel not just for the scenes. Besides,the car race and gun fire scenes in the movie are among the highest standard. It is definitely a enjoyable experience to watch a movie like Ronin.

B00003CXE7|4.0|The story of Gladiator is rather simple. A loyal general stands all the suffer of becoming a gladiator and finally won his honour back. But the making of the film is truly great. The first battle scene itself alone is worth the price of the video. The fighting in the Colosseum is also gracefully presented. I kept rewinding these parts for many times and still enjoy them so far. The first half of the film is much better than the second half and the ending somewhat doesn't live up with the expectation.
0679879269|5.0|I picked up the &quot;Golden Compass&quot; on a whim - It had just been reviewed favorably on NPR and I walked into my local Book store to find it in Hardcover and in the clearance rack! Kismet!<br />Needless to say, it was difficult to wait the past 2 years for the follow up to the Subtle Knife. Yes, I read the Harry Potter's and yes, they were amusing to me, but these books are the real deal my friends.<br />As a child who grew up on Narnia and the Tolkin Books, this all felt like very familiar territory for me. The writing was complex and with enough use of language and metaphor that I was amused and provoked. I love good wordsmiths, and I feel that Pullman is one. <br />Yes, the beginning was a bit slow. Yes, If I hadn't been so eager to jump into the book, I would have re-read the first two, so as to get my bearings. However, it did not take long to re-orient myself to the story and get absorbed by the story.<br />This is Not Harry Potter. While I enjoyed those books, These are more fully written and fully realized stories. People Die, sometimes evil wins, and everyone does not walk away happy at the end. That is what good writing should be - even if the story was a bit thin in some places, I forgive the author for an excellent trilogy, with a very engaging ending.<br />I would be most happy to see Pullman re-visit some of his characters - especially Mary Malone, and Iorek. There are more stories to be mined in these pages.<br />Curl up and read these over this long winter. They are worth the time spent.
B00000K19E|4.0|I was quite impressed by the film in the cinema. Good plot, no similar stories have never been seen. The slow motion of flying bullets is probably new. Later I bought the vcd which includes the making of the film. It was a good effort to invite Hooping as the action director. But the actors were trained for only three months which might be a little short. As a usual practice, actors and actresses who have no martial arts background ususally need 6 months' training before they can really perform in front of the camera. (5-6 months for crouching tiger hidden dragon, as an example). The fighting scene between keanu and the laurence is like kids' playing. Their movement lacks a little grace which could probably prevent it from becoming a classic. Maybe you don't agree with me now, but if you carry on to watch other movies directed by Yuan Hooping, you will realise that what I have said is not exaggerated.

0812589041|5.0|Every child thinks he or she is the most intelligent creature who has ever lived.  Ender is a child.  The difference is that he really IS the most intelligent creature who has ever lived!<br />Every child feels both challenged and enthralled by the prospect of growing up and becoming an acknowledged adult, and then feels betrayed when that acknowledgement turns out to have seemingly unfair strings attached.  Ender is a child.  The difference is that the strings really ARE unfair, and the betrayal he experiences will change him forever-- and, I promise, will change you the reader as well.<br />Like the medieval drama Everyman, this book and this series take us beyond the story of an individual to the story of every individual who has ever lived, encapsulated in one remarkable and unforgettable character and his siblings.<br />Like most people who like to think of themselves as experts, but aren't, I am much given to making up top five and top ten lists.  (Regarding everything I come into contact with.)  For years I had a top five list of science fiction works.  Then I read Ender's Game and its sequel Speaker for the Dead.  These connected and inseparable works were at least the equal of anything already in my list.  The additional books in the series have done nothing to change that perception.  Yet I was too attached to my Top Five list to displace anything in it.  What to do?  It became my Top Six list, and the Ender series is what forced me to change it.<br />The moment when Ender realizes the enormity of the deception that has been perpetrated on him is one of the most powerful moments in all of literature.  Someday Orson Scott Card, along with Ursula LeGuin, Frank Herbert, Vonda McIntyre, Alexei Panshin, and George R. R. Martin, will be admitted to the pantheon of Great Writers and the limiting and derogatory phrase 'of Science Fiction' will be dropped forever.

0812550757|5.0|When you have been betrayed by humanity as a precocious child, as Ender was in the first book of this series, Ender's Game, what do you do?<br />As an adult, you discover and/or invent a religion that will elevate humanity above itself.  In this case, through the medium of pain.<br />Whether you are a religious person or not [I happen not to be, but that doesn't mean I don't see religion's power and value], you cannot help but be moved by Ender's dilemma in Speaker for the Dead.  Just as the Navajo have no word in their language for 'religion,' because what we think of as their religion is simply an integral and irremovable part of their whole culture, so the Pequeninos on Ender's new planet have a cultural tradition which is 'merely' an intergral part of their whole life cycle.  To humans, it seems barbaric in its pain and in its focus on death, but to them it is the sole way to metamorph into the next natural and inevitable stage of their existence.  As a supposedly objective human observer, what should Ender do?  You may well ask.  The moment when Ender discovers the true nature of the Pequeninos' metamorphosis is the most [literally] gutwrenching moment I have ever experienced as a reader.<br />For Card, himself a member of a religious denomination that seems sometimes barbaric to outsiders [LDS], the dilemma provides the perfect metaphor for humanity's relationship to its chosen beliefs.  This is of course the raw wound at the heart of all of Card's fiction-- it only seemed to disappear for a moment in Ender's Game, until we could look back at it from here-- and as always the author makes a very convincing argument that religion, particularly his, is vital to humanity's survival.  Whether you buy the argument or not, it is impossible not to be moved by the dilemma.<br />Awards are funny things.  How many times has the Best Motion Picture 'Oscar' gone to the actual best picture?!?  Five or six times ever, maybe?  But here's a case where the awards called it right.

B000002HEM|3.0|Little known fact: 10,000 Maniacs appeared on Unplugged in both of it's versions: the more well-known version that everyone and their mother seems to be on, and the original version, which was more focused on modern folk bands.<br />In any case: this CD was the last recording before Natalie Merchant left the band. It serves, in a strange way, as a Greatest Hits album. So why do I listen to it and just not get as worked up as I do for Like The Weather or Blind Man Zoo? Maybe a part of it is that I've never been enamored with the Unplugged series. I just didn't seem to get the idea that the band was into it. I give the idea that you could do better, in this case, to go for one of the earlier albums, and proceed from there.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Everything that can be said about the Beatles has been said. However, 30 years after their demise, this greatest hits package is a breath of fresh air on an otherwise ho-hum chart. To the younger listeners who are discovering this phenomena with fresh ears, the music will most assuredly speak for itself. The song list touches on most of the flashpoints to what can only be referred to as THE rock 'n roll experience of a lifetime. Ask any fossil rocker old enough to remember the ride and listen to the list of songs that deserved to be on this disc and aren't. Ask any open minded new listener and they'll probably wonder how this compendium could be any better.  It's always been a great source of satisfaction to listen to the Beatles, only now, it is a great source of pride that the parents can share the soundtrack to their youth with kids who not only like to listen to it, but in many ways are claiming this magical music for themselves. Just close your eyes, relax and float down stream. The Beatles are back!

It's become more and more safe. Not like you can hear on these four dics together with Andy Summer and STEWART COPELAND. It has unusual instrumentations, provided by (mostly) the excellent guitarist A.S and the exeptional drumming by S.C. Without those two in the band, (Sting and) the Police wouldn't have become the band they were, and still is. Try out some of Andy's and Stewarts/klark kents stuff to.... Some of it is excellent...
B00003CXA6|4.0|&quot;Gettysburg&quot; brings one of the best Civil War novels ever written to colorful life. This is a movie about a battle, no doubt about it, and the filmakers have avoided trying to appeal to the widest range of people. Those looking for period romance should look elsewhere.<br />Gettysburg was the pivotal battle in the Eastern theatre of the Civil War, with the Federal army winning the only clear-cut victory they were to achieve after Malvern Hill. The movie follows five main characters:Union Brigadier General John Buford, Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the Union 20th Maine, rebel Brigadier General Lewis Armistead, rebel Lieutenant General James Longstreet, and rebel General Robert E. Lee. Through these men the story of the Battle of Gettysburg is told.<br />The filming is well done, but as the movie was orginally intended for release as a TV miniseries, the resolution is low. Reenactors were used to depict the two mighty armies who clashed in Pennsylania in July, 1863. They know their hobby: uniforms are meticulously accurate and the view of army life in camp and upon the field of glory feels right. That said, some of the reenactors are pretty overweight, and the Confederates especially lack that &quot;lean and hungry&quot; look that period sources describe.<br />Several key portions of the battle are covered in depth. The first day is probably the best done: Buford's skillful defense of the high ground to the south of Gettysburg, the rout of the Union right, and the death of General Reynolds are all shown, and the viewer feels the ebb and flow of the fight. The second day focuses on the action at Little Round Top, and that is all. This appraoch works well in the movie, but the climactic fight around the Peach Orchard, the Wheat Field, and Culp's Hill is overlooked. The third day gives up the chance to show us the clash of sabers as Custer charges Stuart's tired troopers and Kilpatrick sacrifices his men in a series of headlong charges against Confederate infantry. Instead, the movie makers choose to focus on Pickett's charge. It is VERY well done. Long lines of rebel infantry advance on the angle, and the enormity of their defeat is readily apparent.<br />The performances are all top-notch. Martin Sheen's Lee is not quite the charismatic leader of men that the real Lee was, but his agonizing over decisions and simple faith in God will help viewers to identify with the great man. John Buford is played extremely well by veteran Western actor Sam Elliot. But the best performances are turned in by Tom Berenger as Longstreet and Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain.<br />Look for Ted Turner, playing a rebel officer, to get shot down during Pickett's charge, and Civil War filmmaker Ken Burns, as a Federal staff officer begging General Hancock to seek cover during the Confederate bombardment.ate infantry.

B00003CWTI|5.0|Ok,so I gave it 5 stars, and i know that it implies perfection, but deal with it.  First of all, I saw magnolia on opening night in the theater, and didn't really like it that much.  I thought it was ok, beautifully filmed, but it didn't meet my expectations.  Because I knew of the multiple storylines, i expected something tarantino-esque with something that tied together neatly.  Boogie Nights also really affected my expectations.  Since half of the cast of Boogie Nights is in it, I couldn't help but associate it. THIS IS NOT TARANTINO.  THIS IS NOT BOOGIE NIGHTS.  It isn't ironic, sarcastic, and full of pop culture jokes.  It's a bit messy, but so is life.  It is very emotional, and that is why i had trouble dealing with it.  I wasnt ready to &quot;get off my ego&quot; and let it affect me.  Since emotions are the focus, if you can't experience them, the movie feels shallow.  I was expecting a story and event driven movie, and this isn't what i got.  I kept waiting for something, and while i waited, i missed most of it.  But even though i didn't like it all that much, i couldnt get it out of my head.  I kept thinking about it, and i kept realizing how much life really feels like the movie.  At one point in my life, people all around me kept getting hurt, all at the same time. I just kept thinking, this is like magnolia, everyone is experiencing the same things.  So i watched it again when it came out on video, and it was like watching a new movie.  I noticed so much more, and i realized how amazingly real the acting is.  Just watch Tom Cruise react to the question about his mother, and tell me it isn't one of the most real things you've ever seen.  I still felt it was a bit too long, but it seemed more justified.  &quot;Life is Long.&quot;  I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I thought about this movie everyday of my life.  And honestly, this is cheesy but, it really changed my life, and made me see things in a new way.                       SO NOW THEN.      I bought magnolia on DVD and have watched it two more times, everytime, i like it a little more, and i keep seeing new things.  i don't think it's perfect yet, but it might be perfect to me one day.  it isn't so much of a movie as it is an experience. it continues after the credits have rolled and creeps into your life.  whether it is a perfect movie or not doesnt matter. Being perfect doesn't insure this type of impact.  It really isn't for everyone.  I can only think of a handful of people i know who MIGHT like it.  Whenever someone tells me they like it, i'm surprised.  Most people can't invest themselves into something like this.  So i wouldn't recommend buying it if you haven't seen it.  But if you see it, and dont like it, don't give up.  It deserves a second chance if not a third and fourth. This is a movie that keeps growing everytime you watch it.  &quot;This is a long way to go without a punch&quot; but thats all i can say.  have I justified my 5 stars?
6300215512|5.0|I LOVE this movie! This is the quintessential Hollywood film.  Billy Wilder is a genius and this movie shows it!  The screenplay is very original and has wonderful lines!  Norma Desmond is a great character.  Gloria Swanson was born to play th role because the character fits her like a glove.  Swanson, just like Desmond, worked for director Cecil B. DeMille in the silent days, and was forgotten when the talkies emerged. I read in a book that Wilder wanted Mae West to play the role of Norma Desmond at first, but West became insulted by the thought of playing a has-been star who was no longer in her prime.  Wilder also sought some others to play the role, but it was Gloria Swanson who jumped at the role when she first heard about it.  This movie is a classic and there has never been another film like it, just as there has never been another character like Norma Desmond. This is film noir and Hollywood at it's best in this film...See if you can pick out who Norman's friends- the dim figures- are!  See this movie!

The costumes are awesome!  This is not your traditional musical!  It's very different.  I would suggest watching 'Cabaret' first, then watch 'All That Jazz'. This is not technically Bob Fosse's autobiography. Joe Gideon is more like Fosse's alter-ego, becuse Gideon dies in the end, for thoes would couldn't figure it out.  This is a good movie, it has good cinematography and good musical numbers- give it a chance!
B00004XONN|5.0|i wondered what they would do after ok computer, arguably the best album of the 90's. if they had done ok computer part 2, it would have been great and probably would have satisfied audiences, but they took a risk and made the most detatched, inhuman, anti-rock album of any major band in history. i'm sure some people are disappointed, but what needs to be understood is that this is *art*. it transcends entertainment and belongs in the realm of rothko and pollack, or better yet, stockhausen and cage. i'm not sure if we can call radiohead pop anymore. <br />     this is a great album, obviously, but i think it might just be a taste of what is to come -- a warm-up, really. this is a new world for radiohead and they are still far from full realization. for all those people who feel they missed out on the truly great, truly revolutionary pop music - beatles, floyd, velvet underground, zeppelin, dylan - here's our second chance.
B00004XONN|5.0|The music in this CD is utterly beautiful. Some of these tracks really just put an effect on me like no other music could. I am not a fan of Radiohead's previous work.

B00004XOWM|1.0|Oh, yay!  Another manufactured POP BOY BAND with inane lyrics and sell-out attitudes.  There is not enough talent in this band to fill up the top joint of Britney Spears' pinky.  Their songs are juvenile and are about as socially conscious as The Baha Men's &quot;who let the dogs out.&quot;  If this is hard-core, the only thing to be pissed off about is this crappy music encoded on this disc. It's a good thing that Fred D. is friends with Carson Daily, they sooo have a career three years from now.  MTV would NEVER crap their favorite turds.  Maybe they can hang out together at a hot dog stand and relive their glory days; recalling when they were every thirteen year old's idol.  If this is the future of &quot;rock and roll&quot; then I would rather listen to Color Me Bad.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS CD, if you want real rock check out AC/DC's new album.  Forget this band...limp is right.
B000002NJS|4.0|This album is more than just Madonna's foray into electronica, and shouldn't be looked at as only that. Here Madonna and her co-writers bring us songs with depth and emotion, and though it would appear that the electronica bleeps would somehow take away from the lyrics themselves, they only seem to enhance them, a great example would be &quot;To Have and Not To Hold&quot; (Track 11.) <br />This album is far from perfect however, &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; and &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; delivers music too harsh for most listeners, &quot;Skin&quot; skimps on lyrics to deliver electronic sound, and even one of the better tracks &quot;Ray of Light&quot; receives its popularity from the in-your-face bass-line, as opposite to something a little softer.<br />But the songs near the end of this album contain Madonna's best work yet. &quot;Frozen&quot; is perhaps one of Madonna's most beautiful songs. &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot; has a good rhythm going for it. &quot;To Have and Not To Hold&quot; has some of the best lyrics on the album, as well as what I would call 'electronica gone good.'<br />With a few bad patches, with numerous good patches that make up for it, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is Madonna's best work in album form, even after the release of the following album.
6305696071|2.0|For those of you who love the original cut of this movie avoid this version at all costs!  I received this version as a Christmas gift and I started to watch it one Saturday afternoon.  One of my favorite lines was missing almost right off the bat.  Instead of &quot;Lights, lights would be good here&quot; the two main characters discuss condoms and safe sex.  It goes downhill from there.  Some beloved scenes are just gone.  This is a gritter look at Vivian Ward and her life as a prostitute.  The glossed over lovable Hollywood romance now has a darker side - a side I did not like.  I have seen B versions of other movies and those were OK.  This was the first time that the rhythm, feel, and overal essence of a movie has been altered so dramatically.  This selected B roll is a very different movie from the Pretty Woman that I know and love.

I had to buy this album to finally like it, but I think it was only because I was tired of not liking it, because I really wanted to like Madonna's new sound. Perhaps it's more accessible than Madonna's previous album &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; but some quality is left behind this time.<br />Songs like, &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; and &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; displays electronica at it's harshest. &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; is catchy, but it takes some getting used to. And some of the better songs like &quot;I Deserve It&quot; and &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; give us a country feel, that I think is ruined by the electronics.<br />But even among all of this, there are some jewels. &quot;Paradise (Not for Me)&quot; is similar to that of The Beatles' &quot;Because,&quot; and I cannot praise &quot;What it Feels like for a Girl&quot; enough, because it could possibly be Madonna's best song ever.<br />While Madonna at her worst is better than most at their best, be prepared for an electronica overload when you hear this. Also, be prepared for Madonna at her catchiest. If you like Madonna, you'll want to like this album, and you'll probably give into it, as I did.
B0000520Q2|4.0|I found this video to be much funnier then I thought it would be.  Most of the humor is very juvenile but I could not stop myself from laughing out loud during several scenes.  I can only take Tom Green in very small doses and the movie does not spend to much time on his character which can get very annoying (like Tom Green himself) after more then a couple of minutes.<br />You do need to be in a lighthearted mood to really enjoy this film.  If you are a very serious person or like more sophisticated tongue-in-cheek humor then you will be very disapointed in this movie.  However, if you are looking for a good silly movie then this one will make you laugh.

0780631684|1.0|Why Why why? I dont understand how this movie get such good reviews...Just like the Scream Movies, etc.  The Teen slasher era has to end, these movies are boring and just a waste of money that coulda been used towards a better movie. The story is far from original, a guy who sees whos gonna be taken by death next.  Please,  i think Micheal J. Fox's performance in the frightners was good enough.  The acting blows, the actors, blow, this movie blows....however, everyone's entitled to like whatever they want...Any movie is a good movie. it just depends on its audience...thank you verdy much..
B000005PRX|2.0|It wasn't great but deVito's performance as the villianous penguin is outstanding.
B00003CXDG|4.0|Like any John Woo movie, the stories are not the most well balanced out there, but the action is great.  I will say That M:I 2 didn't have as much action as any other Woo film, but it is certainly pretty good.  This movie wasn't even meant to be a sequel to the Original Mission Impossible, its like a whole new era, a whole new Ethan Hunt. However, If your a John Woo fan, for the most part you should like it, at least the last 30 minutes of it which are for the most part, SPEC-TAC-ULAR.

B00004SCX6|4.0|Why are some people saying bad things about this album? I'll agree that she doesn't have the best voice but so what? Each song has cool beats that are fun to dance to. The chorus of each song is pretty catchy and easy to sing along to. Britney is a very sweet singer and should not be put down. Believe me, this album is very good! The only reason it got four stars is because I feel that the last track, Dear Diary, is sort of cheesy. But overall, the rest of the songs are great!
6303327982|4.0|Oliver Stone directs Quentin Tarantino's tale about Mickey and Mallory going on a killing spree across the country. Woody Harrelson and Julliete Lewis give stunning performances. Robert Downey Jr. is great for his wacked out selfish role. Tommy Lee Jones(in his third Oliver Stone film) is in his craziest performance ever as the country Warden. They should give Rodney Dangerfield an oscar for his outstanding performance as Mallory's drunken dad. The angled cameras,B/W,Flinto green, and Lighting add lots to the film.
B00004XOWM|1.0|If you want to get into Limp Bizkit, no doubt, start with 3 Dolla Bills or Signifigant Other.  Both are pretty good cds.  This one is crap.  They recorded the whole thing in 2 weeks.  His rapping was the best on 3 Dollers, and has gone downhill.  Fred's rapping tracks are horrible, none nearly as good as N2Gether Now (by the way, what is that title supposed to mean?)  And his mellow tracks are the only high point of the cd, even though they arent very good, and they all sound exactly the same.  And all of you who say that this is a good cd, you guys probably just think Fred is hot or are impressed with his excessive cursing.  If you like Limp Bizkit for their rapping, get the first one, if you like their hard rock side, get their 2nd one.  If you like crappy Limp Bizkit stuff, get this one.
B00004XMTC|4.0|People ask me what i liked about Never say Never Again,I say &quot;Oh you mean Thunderball 2.&quot; It isnt an official Bond Film but it is great with the villians. Connery did a better job than Moore would of.Irvern Kishner(Empire Strikes Back)is the director.
B00004W52U|5.0|I bought this cd not knowing what to expect- i had never heard any OpIvy songs, and 3 different people told me different things- one said they were hardcore punk, one said ska punk, and one said pop punk.  All three agreed that it was an excelent album.  So i went home and popped it into the cd player.  They were right, I heard heavy punk, ska punk and pop punk throught the whole cd, sometimes in the same song.  Now I cant keep it out of the cd player.  The only cd i can think of that can challange this cds for my fav is Rancid2000,  Less Than Jake's Losing Streak, and a local band, LWL's cd Quarter Life Crisis.  If you like heavy punk, ska punk, or pop punk, get Operation Ivy's Energy, and you will not be disappointed.

0393317552|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The ideas are very interesting, and well presented.     I must admit to being a bit shocked at some of the other reviews.  It is true that the main thesis is that georgraphic factors predict success of a society, but I don't see how that qualifies as &quot;politically correct&quot;  -  it's just a hypothesis which may, or may not, be accurate.  He doesn't suggest that it is wrong to have alternative hypotheses.  The idea that it is &quot;anti European&quot; to me could only eminate from a reader who assumes European cultures are innately superior intelectually, because I see nothing anti-anybody in it.  The local successes of a wide range of cultures within each continent are explained using the same ideas.  There is a pretty large difference between being anti-European and suggesting that the success of European (Eurasian, actually) culture does not stem from innate superiority.      Whether you end up agreeing with Diamond's views or not, I think there is much to enjoy in this book, and his thesis is at least worthy of consideration.  Right or not, I learned a lot about the early histories of a lot of different cultures, about what is required for the development of agriculture, and was stimulated to consider the possible consequences of becoming an agriculture-based society.
6302378648|5.0|Robert DeNiro is great as Max Cady. He is a great villian. His performance was over the top. I expected based on the 1962 version more from Nick Nolte. Julliete Lewis was great as the young daughter that Max torments and finds in the school.
0385484518|5.0|This book merites 7 stars! A very, very sick man full of wisdom and whos aim of suffering seemed to be to make all of us more aware of the power and the need of love. You can feel it: its the true story of a real &quot;life-teacher&quot;.
0790731509|5.0|One evening about 1982, six of us theater types were sitting around drinking and jawing when I asked, &quot;What's your favorite movie of all time, and don't give me any of the big musicals or overdone studio movies?&quot;  Three of us immediately said, without looking at each other, &quot;Cool Hand Luke.&quot;  I've had others join the list, &quot;LA Confidential&quot; among them, but it's still an impressive, thoughtful, subtle movie that I enjoy watching and rewatching.
B000002LGA|4.0|If it were not possible to turn a record off after you'd started listening to it, this record would be worth two stars. Had only the first eight songs been included, it would be worth five.<br />New York starts out so effervescently, it's impossible to credit how badly it loses its way. Lou Reed's overall approach is fantastic - get a bunch of guys in a room, flip the \\"record\\" switch, and play - don't even turn the tape off between songs (yes, it's true: New York carries on the honourable tradition of intra-track amplifier buzz).<br />And for half an hour, this works just fine, because the material is up to it: Romeo Had Juliette - well, the title says it all -is raw, brutal and vital. Dirty Blvd is the same. The socio-political undertone, while undeniably there, is still an undertone: understated enough not to get in the way of the rock 'n' roll. This suits Reed's socio-political ends, too, because while you Get The Point, the music Still Sounds Tough.<br />For a while. The first sign that everything might be about to go off the rails is There Is No Time. Suddenly Reed's patented, nonchalant chic delivery - you know, the half-spoken drawl - is gone and he literally bellows out the lyrics, which sadly comprise some of the most knuckle-headed sloganeering you're ever likely to hear (although he gets bonus points for getting the word \\"circumlocution\\" into a rock song. Not.) Is Lou being ironic, you wonder? Sure hope so.<br />But no. After a brief reprieve, the original musical focus is jettisoned completely in favour of dud invective of the sort only \\"serious\\" rock musicians of the eighties could issue with a straight face. And there the album remains, dignity gone, to the point where you wish someone would take it out and shoot it, for its own good.
6305558167|3.0|The film opens with a perfect image of dark nights in dark combat. Uther fights the Cornwall for the Kingship, yet Uther spoils the new alliance by taking the Duke's wife to bed (with Merlin's aid). Their son, Arthur, eventually becomes king. The rest of the story unfolds from there.<br />While the imagery, costumes, and story is quite good, Trevor Jones' music is horribly experimental and distracting (even resorting to the over-used Carmina Burana at moments when he runs out of ideas), the liberties taken with the story unacceptable, and some scenes are just plain weird (such as when Arthur initially draws Excalibur from the stone and hides with Merlin overnight).<br />Merlin takes too much of an active role in the film, even physically and strategically aiding in an intial battle where Arthur claims his kingship. Lancelot (Nicholas Clay) does not speak in a French accent. Arthur shows little of his grand morality and presents no justification for his worthiness as king.<br />Merlin and Morgana are played well, even though their characters are written a bit over the top. Did you even know Liam Neeson was in this? So is Patrick Stewart, who gives the best performance of the film as Leondegrance.<br />While this may be the best King Arthur movie that I've seen, that doesn't mean that there aren't better ones out there, or better ones coming.<br />Whatever you do, don't pay full price for this DVD. It's not quite worth it.
6303921248|5.0|After visiting 3 different libraries in my hometown in the attempt to find and borrow all six of the Pride and Prejudice tapes, I decided that I should buy my own copies!  I chose the two-tape version, which I'm not certain amazon.com offers yet.  It is more convenient to watch two tapes instead of six, and I think that the quality of the film is still maintained remarkably well.<br />This is the perfect movie for a rainy day.  It runs 226 minutes and the acting is SUPERB!  I am always entranced by this love story.  I've watched this film, since I bought it in August, at least 4 times.  Elizabeth Bennett is easy to love and respect, and it is so satisfying to watch Mr. Darcy stew and suffer in his pride!  Mr. Bennett, Elizabeth's father, has to be the funniest man in the world.  This tape is worth watching just for his torturous (yet humorous!) remarks to his wife and daughters.  This movie is remarkably true to Austen's work.  A few minor scenes are changed, such as Mr. Collins' final visit to the Bennetts' home and the situation of Colonel Fitzwilliam, but true Jane Austen fans cannot be disappointed.  This movie will make you a Jane Austen fan, if you aren't already.  I love her works because they all seem to have rich, heartwarming endings.  People with serious flaws overcome them for love.  Yes, this is a chick flick.  You will want to strangle Elizabeth's sister Lydia, and you cannot help but fall in love with Mr. Darcy!<br />You will love this film.  It is expensive, but it is well worth the price.
B000002HRE|5.0|I don't care what old fans are saying, but there are lots of us, who think that  Fuel,The Memory Remains,The Unforgiven II and Low Man's Lyric are the best Metallica songs ever. And yes, we buy, not Napster it.
6303965415|5.0|I absolutely adore this film.  I had never read the book and I didn't know the story, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie-- almost as much as Pride and Prejudice!  As with all of Jane Austen's works, I could barely keep up with the names of the people and families involved in the story, which is imperative to understanding the story as it unfolds, so pay close attention to the names of the characters as they come into the film.  Amanda Root does a splendid job of playing Anne, who is not a traditional beauty, but who is loved by several men for her intensity, intelligence, and of course her golden heart.  Ciaran Hinds stole my heart!  When he confessed that his love for Anne had never died, I was jumping up and down with happiness.  Or perhaps it was jealousy...  He is handsome and, of course, a perfect gentleman.  The characters we love to hate also get the chance to spice up this story.  Anne's father is terrible.  He only cares about appearances.  He endlessly talks about the women and men of his acquaintance and all of their physical flaws.<br />The costumes, old-fashioned homes, and acting in this film are all superb.  I liked this movie even better the second time through, probably because I could associate each character more readily with his or her name.  Rumors and gossip make so much more sense when you know who people are talking about...  I loved this movie because it made my heart leap for joy as Anne and Captain Wentworth fell in love all over again, and I also loved it because Anne was so easy to love as a character.
0783229526|1.0|In a word - awful.  A really big disappointment...
0140177396|5.0|I read this book as a school assignment and it is one of the few good reading assignments I have ever had. The characters are all excellent; you almost get to know them through this short book. The ending is sad, in fact the whole story is sad, but is very well done
6300216802|2.0|This is easily the weakest of the Trek movies (yes, V was an overbudgeted episode of TOS, but I will give Shatner credit for trying, at least.)  A friend of mine calls it &quot;Star Trek: The Motionless Picture.&quot;  It's the only Trek movie I know that most people don't want to see.  And now, with the Special Edition DVD being prepared, we know why.<br />Paramount, in their infinite wisdom, apparently simply tossed the first assembly up on the screen.  That's right, folks, this video is literally ALL the scenes and cuts Bob Wise was going to use, basically the second draft of a novel.  You've got a lot of cutting to do, but there's a good job buried in there.<br />This was apparently mentioned in the original interview footage that was going to be on the DVD, but Paramount is apparently cutting it heavily, trying to erase just how close they came to killing this franchise dead.<br />If you're a hardcore Trekkie and nothing more, save your money for the (probably) Special Edition DVD.  The movie's being edited, special effects are being added, and what we'll see will probably be at least fifteen minutes shorter and, I'm betting, a star better.  Bob Wise is no slouch, check out his &quot;The Haunting&quot; (no, not the Liam Neeson version!  The GOOD one, the black and white one made in the 60s!)  Plus, they can toss all the TV pilot crap that was in it.<br />If you're a film student, you should buy this AND the DVD, because it'll be an interesting lesson to compare the two.  The movie, as it stands, reeks.  As I said above, the DVD version will probably be better.  It's WHY it's better that's worth paying attention to.
B00004YRQA|5.0|If you plan on building your PS2 library, you MUST buy one of these to save games.  These PS2 memory cards will only work with PS2 games, and you can't use the old memory cards to save PS2 games.  In addition, it should be noted the premium price of this memory card (as opposed to other third party manufacturers or makers of PS2 memory cards) is well worth it.  I found that I would run into problems (inconsistencies, lost files, etc.) when using memory cards made by others. Pay the extra and get the Sony.
6303402348|5.0|This movie was truly inspiring to me.  It proved that even those with lower-than-average IQ's can be a success in life, and I'm one of them.  I can barely balance a checkbook and my I.Q. is &quot;dull normal&quot;, but I can spell and type 120-140+ words per minute and I'm very successful in my career as a medical transcripionist.  Again, this is a wonderful movie that hubby and I like to watch over and over because it inspires us (we are also both epileptic).
B00003CX8J|4.0|I wish Amazon would change their rating scale.  How about 1-100?  <br />I had zero expectations coming into this flick, except for the fact that I think Patrick Stewart is a terrific actor and that I was about to watch a comic book come to life.  A fine job they did in doing so.  Excellent effects, interesting setup (I've never read the X-men comic, so I have no point of reference as to how the movie may have differed).  All in all a good rental.<br />By the way, for the person who complained about the dynamic range of the movie, and in doing so, gave it 3 stars, uh, how about taking a few minutes and reading your DVD and Stereo manual.  There's a little thing called COMPRESSION that you can turn on to COMPRESS the range of the volume so that you don't have to keep adjusting it the whole night.
078062999X|4.0|Branagh's version of the classic play is a wonderful adaptation and, although I might be hated for saying so, better than Mel Gibson's. His performance is, for the most part, excellent, and he truly shows Hamlet's emotions. There are a few lines, however, that I disliked how he said them. His &quot;My thoughts be bloody&quot; speech starts off well, but then it becomes a sort of &quot;Henry V rousing the troops at Agincourt&quot; speech. Aside from that, he is great. Derek Jacobi is perfect a Claudius. Laertes, Gertrude, and Polonius do excellent jobs save certain moments were they lack feeling. Horatio is great and heart-wrenching as the best friend caught in this huge mess. Billy Cristal and Robin Williams are surprisingly good, Cristal in particular. However, Kate Winslet and Jack Lemmon, expecially the latter, are horrible. The look of the movie and the adaptations of the more famous scenes, expecially Claudius' praying scene, blew me away. The choice to do the play uncut took courage on Branagh's part and it pays off. Changing Fortinbras' intentions is interesting and original, but it is a mixed blessing as it ruins the parralellism between him and Hamlet (Rufus Sewell is, by the way, very good). Overall, I think that anyone who loves the play like I do (which is hart not to do) will be thrilled by the movie.
B00000B9BD|5.0|Early in the 1970's, I went to see Fleetwood Mac at the then Tower Theatre in Philly and remember Stawbs ( originally known as the Strawberry Hill Boys) opening for them. They played about an hour and blew everyone away.  Poor Fleetwood minus Jeremy Spencer and Peter Green ( no Lindsay and Stevie yet) were virtually bood off the stage, people screaming for Strawbs to come back, even as the band entered the podium. Strawbs began the set with Benedictus...and then went into Down by the Sea, Hero and Heroine, and then In Amongst the Roses...it was one of the best 4 set I ever heared in a concert, anywhere! Heck, my yoga teacher back then use to chant the chorus to Benedictus in her yoga mundles every Friday night...and she was in her 40's at the time.<br />The popularity of this album at that time amongst serious listeners of prog rock can not be underscored. It is a concept album that really hits at the root of the spirituality that was availiable and happening at that time, steeped in tarot, medieval mysticism, and alchemy...the entire album is a journey into some form of Blakian enlightenment, as Cousins seemed to be taking his studies in these areas very seriously. Though Strawbs was to produce fine singular pieces in the future, they would never attain the complete package ( I have an original LP and the artwork is just gorgeous ), nor the complete concept, like this one again. Metaphors and symbolism abound on this record...the little man, the hermit/traveler, the Queen of Dreams, the flower and the fool ( on the cover too), the transformed Old Sage,  they are all there...the ancient journey of turning inward is about to begin, leaving behind the confusion of the world...&quot;Grave New World&quot; and &quot;Heavy Disquise.&quot; Strawbs seemed to take seriously what the Beatles only dabbled in when they made their pilgrimage to India. Additionally, this LP occured well before the &quot;New Age Merchants&quot; could get their hands around what was going down. <br/>So what relevence does this all have today? Very little unless you are a fan of prog rock and want one of the best, most uniquely blended concept albums ever produced ( in ANY genre). The lyrics, artwork, musicality, instumentation, albeit..the sum of all the band's talented energies went into making a singular concept to express a clear spiritual point. And it was done in a fashion that was deeper and more gorgeous ( Cousin's style I guess) than &quot;Tommy,&quot; &quot;Days of Future Passed,&quot; or &quot;Court of the Crimson King&quot; ( though one could argue who had the better musical scores). If you can get your hands on an original copy of the LP, it is well worth having along side your cd, since some of the &quot;wholeness&quot; of this album is lost a little with the cd alone. But for fans of prog rock, this cd is an ABSOLUTE MUST. I don't want to sound like your grandpa, but seriously, they simply don't produce concept albums as complete as this one was and still is. If you are a musician and want to know how to put together the most complete conceptual package, start here.
B00003CXDG|5.0|Just as exciting as the first movie.  Cruise went all out in this thriller and didn't dissapoint anyone.
B000002KO3|5.0|During the early 1980s, Talking Heads were among several artists who incorporated &quot;World Music&quot; elements into a pop context.  Though this lead to some interesting music, few artists were able to synthesize these elements with complete success.  Of all these artists, Talking Heads most fully realized their ambitions and this album stands out as their artistic peak.<br />Remain in Light is African poly-rhythms (and other World Music elements), exotic instrumentation, electronic sounds, applied to clever, highly literate songs.  All of these complex elements are synthesized seamlessly by producer Brian Eno.  While this album is nominally a Talking Heads record, David Byrne and Brian Eno deserve all the creative credit.  The songs were written primarily by Byrne and Eno (who contributes musically to every track), with the other Talking Heads serving to accompany the other studio musicians.<br />A few other reviewers have remarked that this album sounds like mush, with elements thrown together without haphazardly.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The World Music elements, pop elements, and studio effects are used judiciously to create music the feels effortless.  It obviously isn't entirely spontaneous because there are so many exquisite sonic details and each song is precisely crafted.  Every time you listen to Remain In Light, you will notice something you haven't heard before.<br />What makes Remain In Light even more remarkable is how endlessly listenable it is.  The song structures are atypical of most popular music and Byrne writes some bizarre, esoteric lyrics.  But Byrne sings with a quirky, often subtly humorous (that often isn't recognized) irony that makes the songs palatable.  The songs are highly literate and impenetrable, yet infectious at the same time.  Usually a song like, &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;, which features deliberately esoteric lyrics and some unusual sound effects, would never have a chance of becoming a hit.  But, thanks to a Eno's memorable melodies and Byrne's ironic delivery, it did.  Not every song on Remain In Light is as infectious as &quot;Once in Lifetime&quot;, but the whole album is focused and rivetting.  The songs merge flawlessly and the chilling drone of, &quot;The Overload&quot; is an unforgettable conclusion.<br />What distinguishes the Talking Heads from other artists who dabbled in World Music was how well they are able to assimilate these ingredients into their own musical stew.  Often when other artists (Peter Gabriel, Sting) use World Music elements, it seems artificial, and unfinished.  On Remain In Light, Talking Heads created a fully synthesized amalgamation of diverse, sophisticated musical components that feels entirely natural, without bastardizing their source material (or their own artistic vision).  The result is the best album from a band responsible for some of the greatest music released during the late 1970s and 1980s, and certainly one of the greatest records of any time in the history of music.<br />Note:  Fans of this album should also listen to, &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot;, by Byrne and Eno.  It serves as an instrumental counterpart to this album.  It isn't as good as Remain In Light (mostly because there are no real songs, just instrumental pieces that often aren't memorable), but it's definitely worth listening to.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|Boy, do I hate this album.  I like Christina OK, but I completely agree with some of the other reviewers.  She just couldn't seem to forego the opportunity to try and showcase her vocal range and etc., but it really is at the cost of the music in this case.  <br />If you are looking for a good contemporary holiday CD, don't buy this one...it stinks.
B000002MFN|5.0|Erotica,although given a bad rap, is the grooviest Madonna album.  This album captures her at her most honest and noteworthy time. All the songs are great.
B000002WYT|5.0|I decided to help Amazon.com make a couple more sales by offering a review of this excellent album....<br />  I must admit that I do not love all of the tracks on this album, but they all work together in a wonderful cohesive manner, each track preparing you for the next. Not only this, but better yet, some songs even have a powerful psychosomatic effect...   Every time I hear &quot;Two Step&quot;, it pulls me out of any mood I may be in, no matter how dark, depressed, or silly and immature, and sends shivers up and down my spine, putting me in a wonderful mood for quite a while afterwards. If Dave can do this to a straight guy, imagine what he can do for all you ladies out there (and gentlemen who prefer each other.)Everyone can enjoy this.    Not to turn this into a monologue about &quot;Two Step&quot;, there are a number of very nearly equally amazing songs on this CD, such as &quot;#41&quot;, &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;, &quot;Let you down&quot;, and of course the never-boring &quot;Crash&quot;, which I'm sure you've all heard at one time or another. You won't regret buying this CD, but should you decide to abstain and find that your girlfriend's &quot;friend&quot; has purchased it, you may regret NOT buying it....just kidding about that last part. Anyway, this is a wonderful CD, which, though just over 4 years old, deserves a spot as a modern classic, the definition of &quot;classic&quot; being &quot;something everyone should own and listen to regularly&quot;, not &quot;something everyone wants to own to impress their friends with their good taste but no one wants to buy or listen to except around said friends&quot;.<br />  Either way, I repeat myself, get it. Or better yet, listen to it, fall in love with it, and THEN get it. 'Nuff said
B000002MUW|5.0|Bedtime Stories is almost a preview of what to expect from Madonna before her trip into electronica.  Bedtime Stories is produced by and written by Madonna. Madonna is a true musical genius!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Ok, This CD is good. Also, I like the fact that after almost 40 years it is number one. That really shows the timeless quality of the Beatles.    I will admit, this collection does seem incomplete without Strawberry Fields Forever and many more songs. But, to make a compilation like that would be pointless, because you would pretty much be better off buying all the releases.    Someone said they liked the Beatles because they were the original &quot;boy band.&quot;  I don't know how any of the former Beatles would feel about that comment, but I don't like it.  The term &quot;boy band&quot; is now associated with people who don't write their own songs, dance to their songs and don't play instruments, and 3-5 boys that are put together as a marketing plot.  That is NOT the Beatles.  I think they are above the comment of &quot;boy band&quot; especially what the term &quot;boy band&quot; has come to mean in the recent years.   I am 16 years old, I have been listening to the Beatles for about 6-7 years now...(that is a pretty long time for a 16 year old you know.) My first taste of the Beatles (besides radio) was &quot;Revolver&quot; an album I still listen to all the time.    This CD would be a good choice for someone who is just getting into the Beatles, so they could get a little glimpse of almost everything.  I do think the &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; albums are better compilations, but not many people (or not many young people just starting to listen to the Beatles) have $60 to go out and buy both of those.  (However, I would suggest getting those comps. over time cause they are great.)  I am giving this CD 5 stars because it's the Beatles and it's a good starter CD.  Also it's great for the car, so you don't always have to have a million CDs with you.  I like the pictures of all the singles and stuff inside. But, words would be cool.
0141301155|5.0|If you liked the movie than you will enjoy this book even more.  This timeless story is not only wonderful but adds the magic back in to the life of the reader.  It is not only a book of kid-like dreams, but one to bring a strong moral message to everyone.<br />You will thoroughly enjoy this book.  Don't expect many pictures on the pages, just in your mind.  Enjoy it as you did the movie &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.&quot;
B00004XONN|3.0|Radiohead have either gone completly insane (which isn't very suprising if you've read some interviews of lead singer Thom Yorke lately)or they tried really hard to make this not sound like rock and/or roll. Well, they did a good job because most of the record doesn't sound like much of anything. Yorke is quoted saying Kid A refers to the next stage of human development; robots or something like that. I don't know what he's talking about nor do I know what he's singing about. The lyrics are garbled beyond belief, often with the help of a computer, and the secret hidden lyric sheet (pull out the thing that holds the CD)doesn't help much at all. The whole theme of this album seems to be confusion and post-Y2K panic. While OK Computer complained about modern life, Kid A seems to be Radiohead staring at the future and thinking: &quot;Wow, this is gunna suck!&quot;; Aliens, destruction, corruption or whatever Thom mumbles about; that sorta thing. That's just my guess though. Everything... Opens up with a boring keyboard line and stuttering samples until Yorke comes in singing in a nice falsetto the title line. The vocal part is suprisingly catchy, except for the bezerk verse where  he mutters things like:&quot;Yestarday I woke up sucking on a lemon...&quot; or &quot;There are two colors in my head.&quot; over and over again. And the CD hasn't begun to get weird yet. The title track features an intro that sounds like it's borrowed from Super Mario and Yorke's voice altered to sound like an alien robot frog. The National Anthem (the band preformed this on Saturday Night Live) starts off with a repetitive bass line, drums and assorted weird keyboard noises. In comes Thom and gives a vocal preformance with clear lyrics. Though he doesn't sing a lot on this song, he gets the point across: Something's not right, he can't figure out what it is, and he's really confused. How to... is a ballad that sounds sort of OK Computerish and features strings completly written by lead guitarist Johny Greenwood which shows another side to his imminse talent (he also plays a lot of the electronic things along with Thom), except even with the nice strings and straightfoward drum bass and guitar, the song doesn't get louder or change a lot like the epics on OK did (Paranoid Android). The strings make some weird noise, but so what? Because of this and its length (almost 6 minutes) it makes it kind of boring, though not bad. Treefingers is a very spacey, yet boring, instrumental. Optimistic is a song that actually has Radiohead's three electric guitars in front and almost no keyboards. It's very tightly wound, and on any other Radiohead record it would of exploded into a blur of distortion. It doesn't, but it is still a good song. In Limbo is a nice song. It blends regular Radiohead guitar music with irregular keyboard noises. Despite they did this on some songs on OK, it still sounds different and cool. Idioteque has a techno (!) beat and wierd noises that form an isolating melody and confused lyrics &quot;Whose in the bunker... women and children first... laugh until my head comes off I've seen to much I haven't seen enough.. Ice Age Coming Ice Age Coming&quot; are some of the more sane lyrics. Whatever you say Thom. Morning Bell, a song Thom said is about a ghost he had in his house, (Ok, this guy is either a liar in search of free publicity or comletely and utterly insane) is mellow with a repitive drum line and (suprise) weird noises that form a melody, with a relectuant guitar that inexplicably jumps out of nowhere every once and a while. Motion Picture Soundtrack is mostly  organ/piano. Because of that, (except Optimistic) it is the most straightfoward song on the album. It eventually adds a harp for effect when Yorke sings &quot;I think you're crazy&quot; a buncha times. He should talk! It is dead silent for 2 minutes and than a thirty second instrumental bonus track of God-knows-what. Its very misterous and sounds like someone being abducted by<br/>aliens and after thrity seconds: silence again.  Despite this sounds nothing like OK Computer in the wayPearl Jam sounded nothing like songs from Ten (&quot;Jeremy&quot;) after some experiments, It's still a good buy.
B00004WKII|4.0|being a fan of jimi's since a teenager,and having lost some of his precious lp's and cd's in a fire,you know i was truely excited when this set came out.i will admit just as other reviewers have done that this set does have a few flaws.but the sheer genious that is jimi just permiates everywhere!if you want to hear power trio material,or r&amp;b flavored rock and roll,or progressive rock with a jazz flavor it is here.this set may not be for everyone,but for collectors and serious jimi fans,this is a must!check out the awe inspiring blues on red house.you've never heard blues guitar like this!
0451169514|3.0|This story of a group of kids in Maine was a little too long for me.  King does know how to tell a good story but this one was a little too much.  It was still a good read but I would never read it again.  The ending was a little weird and maybe a little innapropriate.  I guess thats whats so great about King though.  Ive only read 4 King novels and many of his short stories and this one was somewhere in the middle.  I loved Salems Lot and his short stories were great too. (The Mist was absoulty amazing, one of the best short stories ever)
B000009VOL|5.0|This album, an easier listen than BR's last album (In An Expression of the Inexpressible), made it to my top ten list of 2000.  Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons is a beautiful album.   Each track is profoundly different, but the diversity only adds depth and dimension, making it an album that is easy to repeatedly listen to.  There are catchy tunes such as &quot;In Particular,&quot; and &quot;This is Not,&quot; but there are also more experimental pieces such as &quot;Ballad of Lemons,&quot; which by the way, seriously sounds like an alien invasion or something.  Most people go crazy over &quot;In Particular,&quot; because of the hand-clapping-sounds...the rhythms are very fun indeed.  My favorite track would have to be &quot;This is Not&quot;...the keyboards are what gets me (SO MUCH FUN!) and the upbeat tempo inspires me to chair dance.  It may be a toss-up with &quot;Hated Because of Great Qualities,&quot; a track that has a dramatic element, which Kazu Makino's delicate voice fosters so well.  The track is even better on the EP because the lyrics are in Italian (and even though I can't understand a word of it, it's breathtakingly beautiful).  I highly recommend this album...the friends that I have introduced to it immediately embraced the trio, and have been avid fans ever since.
B00004RFFO|5.0|i was a little uncertain about this movie at first but when i watched it, it blew my mind.  non-stop action to the end realistic looking sharks good characters and a good cast. the whole idea of the setting taking place in the ocean is so cool.  trust me you will treasure this movie in your collection if you buy it. i know i do.
0679441018|5.0|i am only 14 years old and i understand the whole undercurrent of the book Memnoch the Devil.  i found it extremely fascinating to get to know  Memnoch and i think Lestat was the best character out of all in the vampire chronicles to undergo this soul searching with memnoch.  i won't bore you with details about what more i think about this novel but i will tell you this: out of all the troubled souls anne rice has written about i like this one best!
0761119752|5.0|Once you really get a feel for the rhythm of this book (it doesn't take long) you and your toddler will adore it. My 2 year old loves Boynton's board books best, and Pajama Time quickly surpassed Barnyard Dance as his absolute favorite book. We can calm him down any time by repeating the sing-songy words to Pajama Time. Since our son loves to take a bath but isn't always anxious to get out of the tub, we started chanting the words to Pajama Time as we reach for the towel. It calms him down and reminds him that his favorite book is coming up soon and is worth getting out of the tub for. Putting on his pajamas is less of a squirmfest, too, since having pajamas on is much more fun now.<br />As always, Boynton's illustrations are amusing and adorable. We particularly like the variety of pajamas shown on the animal characters. This book makes a great companion book to Boynton's Hey, Wake Up--the two together would make a wonderful gift.<br />Highly recommended.
B00004RHZU|4.0|Cant take me home is an excellant debut album.  Pink has her own unique sound and is fastly becoming one of the most respected female singers about at the moment.  Featuring the singles, There You Go, Most GIrls and the forcoming single You Make Me Sick, Pink shows that she has a varied musical taste and lyrical range.  It would be wise to take this cd home today
6301969294|4.0|I noticed a lot of poor reviews of this movie and it seems as though those viewers do not truly understand what the movie is about.  Some complain that it is an absurd parallel to Hitler and the Nazi party.  Others complain that it is to fake because  people would never get worked up over this mans architeture style.  Well the truth is that the majority of these reviews are WRONG.  Granted they all wanted to seem intellectual and rave about the philosophical significance of the novel and how it carried over into the movie, I can not knock them for that, but never before have I seen someone so off base when it comes to the meaning of this movie.  The main character in the movie, played by Cooper, is actually a mock of the real life architect Frank Lloyd Wright, on of America's greatest architects may I add.  He really did encounter many of the same things as Coopers character did, including getting kicked out of Architecture school and people not excepting his work.  Just recently the novel and movie &quot;PRIMARY COLORS&quot; was released, and many know that the book is an interpretation of Bill Clinton's life. Many of the characters in it do not have the same name as the people they represent in real life. The style used in THE FOUNTAINHEAD is the exact same as the novel PRIMARY COLORS, real people and events, different names.  So I suggest buying this movie and ignore many of the ignorant reviews placed at this site.
079074404X|5.0|A fantastic film!  Moviemaking at its absolute best here!<br />Before special effects became the main attractions, &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; had already set the &quot;high-bar&quot; in space travel science fiction.  A truly intelligent plot divulged here along with a moral line that's woven so skillfully inside.<br />The humorous portion of the film is also well underplayed with witty dialogue subtly woven into the action.  Leslie Nielsen gives us a small glimpse into his comedic side as the strong and handsome commander.  Walter Pidgeon is perfect in his role as the language expert who analyzes the powerful alien technology.<br />Anne Francis is truly beautiful in this production, and plays her part with engaging enthusiasm.  She veils her hidden love for the commander Nielsen by mocking his &quot;I'll put more guards on the guards!&quot; and claiming that she &quot;just doesn't like him!&quot;  It's great!<br />Robby the Robot is great ... with a perfect voice and a demeanor that never gets tiring ... What's still nice about this film is that the technology, while a major part of the story, really takes a backseat to the characters as you watch them try to deal with the invisible, but deadly 30-foot monster than can tear buildings to shreds and melt supposedly impenetrable walls.  I believe this concept was used as the basis for one of the episodes of the great &quot;Johnny Quest&quot; cartoon series where an invisible creature, leaving footprints, follows a trail of electric lights to its end.<br />There's the ship's cook who's rewarded with 60 gallons of his favorite hooch ... a burping robot who ingests the hooch to analyze its molecules ... a little love rivalry between the men ... holograms (simulated) in an early sci-fi movie ... great costumes for all the actors ... and enough sound effects to make you feel like you're watching a Saturday afternoon matinee at your local theatre ...<br />This is science fiction at its absolute best ... the original Star Trek comes a very close second ... but it was a series with many, many wonderful stories ... my advice is to be an avid collector of both!
B00004T9UF|5.0|I never liked rap.If you asked me last year,I would say,&quot;Put a c infront of rap and theres my opinion&quot;.After hearing the Eminem CD,something changed.Here are my favorite songs.<br />2-Kill you. 3-Stan.feat.Dido 5-Who knew? 7-The way Iam 8-Real sim shady 10-I'm back 13-Drug Ballad 16-Kim 18-Criminal <br />Go out there and buy this CD if you like tight rymes,reality,and your a blade of grass(eminem hates everyone except the grass)If you like Dr.Dre,you'll like Eminem,and Vice Versa
B000002G7E|1.0|Unless you're a strung-out vagrant with delusional paranoid fantasies, you won't like this cd. In fact, you will hate it. This cd is nothing but one long tuneless assault, it is not music.
B00004XONN|5.0|From the other reviews you can tell that this is isn't your typical Radiohead c.d.  When I bought it I didn't expect to see such a drastic change from ok computer or the bends and at first I didn't like it.  But being the fan that I am I decided to listen some more and now its one of my favorite c.d's.  So if you're unsure about purchasing this c.d because it's different, don't worry you'll grow into it and love it, trust me!!
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice was a very slow going book, but a very good one anyways. I enjoyed and hated the running arounds of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I wanted them to fall madly in love (finally) and everytime that I thought it was going to happen something got in the way. It was a terrific book and I enjoyed the ending the most! :) I would recommend it to anyone with a high tolerance for boredom and also one that has a lot of time to actually read the book.
B00004ZB9D|3.0|It's alright. The CD has it's ups and downs. Hardcore Lenny fans will love it. Some of the songs sound alike but..well it's ok. I don't regret buying the CD. My faves are &quot;fly  away&quot; &quot;american women&quot; and &quot;again.&quot;

B00000IAU3|5.0|I was hesitant at first to get this CD because of a couple of things. The popular song on the CD was being used as a theme song to the television show, &quot;Roswell.&quot; Also, there is a song that is used in an Eminem song. I personally dislike Eminem's music so that discouraged me. I decided to give the CD a try and boy am I glad I did.<br />The current single, &quot;Here With Me&quot; is great but there are many other songs on the CD that are even better. Some great tracks are &quot;Thank You&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot;, and &quot;Isobel&quot;. That isn't saying that the rest of the songs aren't good, they are, those are just the ones that stand out to me. <br />There are unmistakable similarities in Dido's voice to that of Sarah Mclachlan's. Even with that, Dido's own unique style and personality comes through in her songs. This CD is well worth purchasing. It is a real gem that I am glad has been discovered.
0780020685|5.0|This is simply one of the greatest films ever made and completely engulfing.  Plus for those that don't know what they're talking about and prefer brain dead films this is a &quot;Japanese&quot; film about &quot;a bunch of guys&quot; saving a &quot;Japanese&quot; village.
B000051VWW|3.0|A great CD with very nice listening but the recording is dominated by far too much low frequency bass. <br />I suspect it uses electronic bass, earlier Sade recordings probably include a more harmonious double bass.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|In a world dominated by brainless rap/metal acts like Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Disturbed, and many of their cheap rip-offs, At The Drive-In is here with something fresh and innovative. It's hard to catagorize them. They're punk, but they're not; they're emo, but they're not; and they're hardcore, but they're not. Cedric pours his heart into the songs. The music is melodic, but loud and driving, and the lyrics are out there and political. Nobody out there seems to be quite like them, and hopefully they'll get more exposure and put an end to all of these tired Limp Bizkit rip-offs. Songs like &quot;Pattern Against User,&quot; &quot;One Armed Scissor,&quot; and &quot;Sleepwalk Capsules&quot; never get monotonous, and their music constantly changes to keep things interesting. If you don't have Relationship Of Command yet, I suggest you get it now. Along with Radiohead, At The Drive-In are bringing creativity and meaning back to rock.
B00000DD1S|4.0|I had the rare privilege and honor to have been stationed with Albert Ayler with the 76th U.S. Army Band in Orleans, France, from June, 1959, to June, 1961.  We performed together many times, but he was so far ahead of other musicians, that his style was not readily acceptable.  He did perform the standard repetoire of the Army Band, but on nights and weekends he did manage to play with many of the local French musicians, and was readily accepted.  His untimely death left the world with a void that will never be replaced.
0767903854|4.0|Bill Bryson has done it again, producing an unputdownable book. It has some funny and some poignant thoughts. However, don't let this book be your only guide to Australia. He has seen so little. For example, his description of Australian politics as difficult for an outsider to understand escapes me completely. Compared to the Byzantine nature of politics in Britain or the USA, Australia is a model of simplicity. We only have six states and 18 million people so how complex can it be? He also spends so little time in each location that he only is able to capture a few wisps of their flavour.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Mononoke Hime is a stunning movie! The animation is unbeatable, the story is complicated, yet easy to understand. What I love about it is that there is no villain or good super hero. All sides are doing something that they think is right, and it is, yet is is bad to something else. The movie is about life and being alive. It shows us that we are part of the Earth, and that the Earth was not made for us to use. This movie is just moving and exciting at the same time. It has sentimental themes, action, love and cute creatures, yet this movie is not for little kids like Totoro, it has violence and gore, and the plot might be to complicated for small children to understand, but adults and teens will love this movie, because is has something for every taste. My only complaint: there were some sequences that were pointless and not really needed. I highly reccommend this movie, it is definately not a waste of money!
B000050XEI|3.0|I really love Enya and I am a huge fan, but this album was somewhat of a disappointment.  There is one song that sounds purely original, but beyond that, it is a patchwork quilt with little snippets of all of her other albums sewn in.  Now, if you're not familiar with any of Enya's other work, this would be a great introduction for you, but for the devoted fan, the unoriginality is plainly obvious.
B0000028RR|1.0|How can ANYONE say this is the best rap-metal CD? This is the absolute worst! I bought this CD after seeing the excellent reviews at Amazon.com. Boy, I never thought 450 music fans could be rock. This CD has boring riffs and terrible vocals. The only song that doesn't really suck and just kinda sucks is &quot;Killing In The Name&quot;. Other than that, this CD is the most overrated CD ever! NEVER buy this CD! If you want good rap-rock, check out Taproot, Linkin Park or Limp Bizkit!
B0000507R2|5.0|How do I sum up my love for Natalie and this beautiful album in only 1,000 words?  It is a challenging endeavor!  :)<br />Of course I already have the album (in fact I have two copies besides this one), but the DVD version was well worth it!  The sound is absolutely breathtaking and, as each song plays a never-before-seen photo of Natalie and/or the old Tigerlilly band appears on the screen!  When I say the sound is breathtaking, I am not exaggerating.  I have listened to this album millions of times and I was astounded at the clarity of the music.  You can hear parts of the songs that you never noticed before.  And, of course, its the best way to hear Natalie's beautiful voice, next to a live performance.<br />It is a MUST for any true Natalie fan.  :)
0812550757|5.0|<BR>   This is the book where Orson Scott Card's talents really shine through. No one does emotional/ethical dilemmas like Card.<BR> <BR> The storyline: Ender Wiggin has become publicly known as The Speaker for the Dead - a new identity he created, after he is viewed as committing genocide against an entire alien race, after the end of the Bugger wars. Even though he saved the entire human race from certain destruction, the revisionist history makers have turned public opinion against him. The Speaker for the Dead offers his services on the interstellar communication network. Ender travels from planet to planet using lightspeed travel, which keeps him physically young but a tremendous amount of time occurs on earth, so most people assume Ender Wiggin is dead by now. <BR> <BR>   The story takes place on the planet Lusitania, where a alien race called the pequeninos is being studied. When one of the scientists studing this alien race has been killed in a ritual ceremony, the widow requests the services of The Speaker for the Dead. The idea is that a Speaker for the Dead comes and lives with the family of the deceased for about a year and goes to work were the person worked. The Speaker interviews all the co-workers, friends, teachers, and relatives of the deceased - anyone that knew the person. After about a year or a year and a half, a second funeral is held. All the community gathers together to hear the Speaker tell of the persons deepest hopes, fears,and aspirations. The Speaker tries to explain what drove the person to do what they did, with complete candor and total honesty. All the persons secrets are laid bare before everyone. The core idea is that we are a different person around different people. You talk and act very differently around your grandmother than a person does with their beer drinking buddies. You act different around your lover than you do around your friends. In essence, we have so many facets to who we are that no one person ever sees them alland truely knows who we are. <BR> <BR>   What make this book a facinating read is this: there is a small community of only around 150 humans studying this alien race. The entire planet is under quarantine. There is a degenerative virus that is highly contagious - a vacine has been created that slows the progress of the disease down to a crawl - it will take 10 years to kill you instead of a few weeks - but there still is no cure. So once you go down you don't come back -a blockade of battleships ensures this. The humans are confined to a fenced off area of about 2 square miles - this is all the area the humans have been given so that contact with the pequeninos is extremely limited - so their culture is not contaminated by the human presence. Only a small handful of scientists are allowed to make direct contact and study the pequeninos. <BR> <BR>   Ender falls in love with the widow of the man he has came to be Speaker of the Dead for. Ender discovers a terrible secret that will destroy the woman he loves and deeply hurt her children. So the dilemma that Ender has is this: Do you destroy yourself or the person you love? Ender is such a person of incredible integrity that he values the truth above all else. If he reveals the dark secret he has discovered it will severely damage the two two main groups of scientists working on the project - including the woman and her children who he has grown to deeply love. But if Ender didn't reveal the secret would betray his most deeply held values. It would be denying how he has defined his very core being from the beginning - he would have to throw out the essence of himself - because he could not live with the inner conflict.
B0000399WI|5.0|Every so often, I feel cinematic achievement reaches a new zenith...a point where I feel (albeit erroneously) that the bar of accomplishment can rise no more. Yet, as said, I am eventually mistaken, mainly due to remarkable stories of profound creative intensity. These are the creations that highlight vital essences of life and society.<br />The Shawshank Redemption is truly an element of such a category.<br />The Stephen King novella, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, is a relatively brief tale, a section of a larger book called 4 Seasons. Still, it is brilliantly adapted as a feature-length motion picture, with no flaws or injustices therein.<br />If you are wondering why it is such a good movie, then you only need to think about one word: freedom. Think about what it means, and how easy may be to take for granted in today's liberated world. Set in the hardened American past, The Shawshank Redemption teaches us a valuable lesson about the fickle nature of sovereignty, and the inevitable boundaries that restrict us along the path of life. Still, despite the misery of indeterminate and forceful detainment, a love of life is found.<br />As such, this film presents a quest like no other. The characters seek to transcend their enslavement in a vile microcosm of dubious honesty and ill will, cherishing the subtle scents of freedom that waft through the senses on a very limited basis. After seeing this film, you'll never look at a bottle of beer or an opera record the same way: when you have nothing else, such frivolities are your only ties to freedom. Still, the intelligent social analysis does not end at this basic level. Rather, it continues by showing the affects of being reintroduced to reality, and the ensuing overdose of true liberty...<br />Nevertheless, as clear-cut as the overall theme may seem, a mark of cunning snakes through it...fervent...unexpected...<br />The result will knock you out of your seat. See for yourself. 10/10
0783225733|5.0|This was the first DVD that we bought and remains our favorite after over 50 viewings. My youngest, now 5, considers this her favorite movie. It is good family viewing, with sound educational, historical and motivational themes. Thank you Tom Hanks and Ron Howard.
0823003035|5.0|Anthony Ryder created a wonderfully interesting and useful tool for the beginner or intermediate artist. The models were very refreshing, as he used men and women of varying body types (from rather thin to extraordinarily generous)as well as different ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. I reccommend this book because I have found it so helpful in my own drawing, especially because of how he emphasized that the human body is full and curving, regardless of how thin and trim.
B000001FQ8|4.0|When I first got Big Daddy I was so dissapointed.  After Four straight platnuim records, I expected Big Daddy to have the same intensity level of the previous Four.  THis record was such a downer.  However, I relized John was writing about the destruction of his second marrige to Vicky.  I also thought, well, he's been advancing on each record from American Fool on, that the bubble's got to curst somewhere.  But then I really listened.  Even though he was singing in a lower key than the previous four records, it had an even greater intensity.  I love the honesty of Void in my heart and pop singer.  A must for all JM fans.
B00000K501|5.0|Anyone who is a serious Rammstein fan must see this...well this isn't a kiddie concert due to a scene in the song &quot;Buck Dich&quot;.If you get it you'll find what I am talking about. I love Richard's(the guitarist)white-out contacts. The pyrotechnics(which Rammstein's known for)are awesome. This industrial-metal band sounds just as awesome live. &quot;Live aus Berlin&quot; contains all the songs from both albums icluding the song &quot;Wilder Wine&quot;.If you think the things they do are just a bit weird remember that it's a different culture, so keep an open mind. Well I don't know what else to say except buy it. You won't be disapointed.
B00004XOWM|2.0|What is this garbage I purchased, Limp sold out twice.  Three dollar bill, what an album.  What happend after that?  They found out the little boys and girls need songs more mellow with lyrical content so stupid, a four year old can get it.  I mean how many times can you use the f-word.  In this album, Fred seem's to use it as if it was the only word in his dictionary(im referring to the song hot dog), what pisses me off the most is people are buying this crap.  Open your eyes and unplug your ears people! Wes's guitar work is awful, power chords seem to be all Wes knows how to play, John's drums are worser than Significant Other, John change your style, bass drum and snare drum are boring, improvise man!  Sam's bass is barely heard, which is a good thing, and Lethal's scratching, what a disgrace to DJ's around the world.  And then there is Fred, which I won't go into, Fred know he's an awful song writer, so no point in trashing him, all I can say is that Fred can talk the talk but he will never walk the walk.  Please don't buy this crap, waste your money on a movie or another cd, trust me if your a fan of the first album, you'll hate this one, just like fans of the first album hated the second one.  Sure the guys may seem cool, but they lack one spceial thing you need in the music industry, TALENT. But knowing how curiousity will kill the cat, your gonna buy it anyway.  I warned you.
B000002U9Y|4.0|A Saucerful of Secrets is Pink Floyd's second album, and the first without Syd Barrett. While many reviewers dismiss it as a failed attempt to capture the style that Pink Floyd had while Syd Barrett was still in charge, I like the album. <br />The first track, &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot; reminds me of &quot;Brain Damage&quot; in the way that it switches from slow, gloomy passages to soaring, upbeat ones. <br />The next song, &quot;Remember a Day&quot; is one of the very few (under 5) songs written by Wright. It has a good keyboard part, and I like it. <br />&quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; is a gloomy, muted song by Waters. <br />&quot;Corporal Clegg&quot; is upbeat, and sounds like something written by Barrett. <br />The next track, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; is an instrumental. The song starts off with random drum beats/guitar screams and resolves into a melody with what sounds like a choir. <br />&quot;See-Saw&quot; is the only reason that I didn't give this album 5 stars. It can be best described as filler. <br />The last track, &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; is Syd Barrett's last song with Pink Floyd. It was originally recorded as a track for Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but was placed on here instead. It features a Salvation Army band, who were apparently told to &quot;do whatever you want.&quot; I like it...<br />Overall, A Saucerful of Secrets is more than just a &quot;sophomore jinx.&quot;
B00004XOWM|1.0|I purchased this CD from all the publicity I have been hearing about this band.  I put the CD in the player once and it won't be there again.  I like grunge music but this sucks.  I am a guitar player and as a guitar player I know that it probably only took 2 hours to make this in the studio.  It sounds so bad that I think they made the words up as they went along. And for the guitar in the backround...My 2 year old could of done better. There is to much talant out there for this CD to fly.
0789723107|5.0|I can only agree to many happy positive reviews: This book is a must have for everybody who is working on the Internet. Finally an answer to all my questions about navigation, layout and even how people don't think when they surf the Net.
B000002UA7|5.0|This collection from 1986 is a very good introduction to her music - it features singles from her first 5 studio albums. The songs featured on this albums show Kate Bush's ability to be very musically diverse: beautiful slower songs like &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot;, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, and the gorgeous &quot;Wow&quot;, experimental songs like &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Experiment IV&quot;, and big hits like &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, &quot;Babooshka&quot; and a re-recorded version of her debut, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. It's a shame that this album only has 12 tracks (back in 1986 greatest hits albums never had any more, I guess), as some other beautiful singles like &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;, &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot;, &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;, &quot;Suspended In Gaffa&quot; and &quot;The Big Sky&quot; didn't make this collection. Maybe EMI should release an &quot;updated&quot; version in 2001, including all her singles, also the ones released since 1986, like &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, &quot;Rocket Man&quot; and &quot;Moments Of Pleasure&quot;. But still, a great introduction to Kate's music, which is well worth the money!
B00004T8RK|4.0|I liked this CD alot. I'm a Pearl Jam fan who much prefers their earlier CDs. What I liked about their earlier work, and about this CD, is how well this group cranks out go old rock and roll. Most of the tracks could have been written in the '60s or '70s, and that's just fine with me. I would have preferred more Mcready solos, and I think the engineering could have been better (on some tunes, the vocals are drowned out by the instrumentals). But on the whole, I'm pleased Pearl Jam has returned to their roots and encourage others who enjoy rock and roll at its most basic to pick this CD up.
1881273156|5.0|This book goes far beyond the Mars/Venus concept. Not all women want to be loved the same way and neither do all men. Gary Chapman so thoughtfully and intelligentally outlines five different styles in which someone might like to be loved. <br />Some people have problems understanding the concept. They believe they are loving because they are treating their spouse how they want to be treated. That's making the same mistake as ordering a steak cooked rare for someone just because that is the way you like it. But they want it well done.<br />This book is not just for married couples, but anyone who wants to have a loving relationship. <br />Here are some other recommendations for those who want to have blissful relationships.<br />The RoMANtic's Guide by Michael Webb<br />Creative Romance by Doug Fields<br />Don't Sweat the Small Stuff in Love by Richard Carlson
6305268177|5.0|I too was initially disappointed in the audio of this DVD as well as Fleetwood Mac's, The Dance.  I was using the standard RCA plug hookup to TV from my DVD.  Thought it may have been a problem with my DVD player.  DVD player wasn't the problem.  After switching to S-Video cable hookup, the audio is now incredible!  <br />Hope this helps those others who have been experiencing same problem.
0767802659|4.0|This movie is not a glorification of fascism or brutality, although it often invokes people to think so. It is a call against both and shows how tight the line is between patriotism and fascism. Perhaps some of those criticizing it so harshly should compare its storyline to the not-so-long-ago McCarthy era: the bad are always on the other side, they eat children and we are the best and the brightest, what we do is only for a good cause. Take a look.
B00000IL26|5.0|\\"The Sidewinder\\"... 10 minutes 24 seconds of pure \\"cool\\" and a stunningly effective example of how to push jazz into mainstream popular music without compromising on technique or virtuosity. Recorded in 1963 - way before \\"jazz/funk\\" was invented - Lee Morgan lays down its perfect template by creating an insidious riff that captures &amp; holds the listener's attention while inviting improvisation from a superbly tight band that includes Joe Henderson on sax and the wonderful Bob Cranshaw on bass. So clever that their breaks become an integral part of the driving back-beat that results in that rarest of things: a jazz track that you can actually dance to. Definitive, timeless and, above all, fun.<br />And the rest?... high quality early 60's jazz: as good as anything around at the time but overwhelmed by the sheer power of this album's opening track.
B00003CX5A|5.0|I have reviewed this movie before, but now, I feel I must review the DVD, which I recently bought.<br />The movie is of course amazing, with a great combination of hammer horror, suspense, and a great mystery story.<br />The DVD's features are great, too.  The best is the &quot;Behind the Legend&quot; making-of featurette.  It offers a great look into the making of this remarkable film, including the secrets behind its graphic decapitations, how they made the Headless Horseman headless, and how they designed the astonishing sets.<br />Tim Burton's commentary, however, can be passed by.  He tends to babble on about nothing during the whole film, and offers very little interesting information.<br />This is definately a must-have DVD.
6305558167|4.0|Director John Boorman may have bitten off more than anyone could chew by trying to fit the legend of King Arthur into just slightly more than two hours.  The necessity of moving the plot forward does not allow time for much character development.  Rather than human characters with recognizable motivations, we are given iconic figures who behave as they do because the legend demands it.<br />Nevertheless, this film does have some considerable strengths.  It is atmospheric and beautifully filmed.  The production values belie the small budget.  The cast does a marvelous job; its fun to watch some of the early work of Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne.  Also, the poigniancy of the characters' essential plight remains.  These are larger-than-life figures who have taken on the superhuman task of providing for the welfare of their land; however, they cannot avoid being undone by the flaws inherent in basic human nature.
6305169187|1.0|If the American flag would have been on the payroll of this movie, it would have probably gotten more money than Bruce Willis himself; in every third scene or so it sure is to pop up. Oh yes, our American, down to earth boys are going to save the world, who else? The wipeout of a city like Paris is only good for a nice FX and that it might be useful to get help from the rest of the world never occurs to the NASA scientists. Well, if you've seen &quot;Deep Impact&quot; you know the drift.<br />Then let's talk about physics - the way it is treated in this movie would make Mr. Newton spin in his grave. Gravity on an asteroid the size of Texas? And apparently just as much as on earth, the way the protagonists moved? Well, to get that going the asteroid would have to have the weight of Earth on as much room as Texas has. The density would be so high that no matter if you used a 10000 watt drill or a toothpick to dig a hole the result would be the same.  But somehow the gravity also seemed to fade out on story-line convenience, when one of the landing vehicles is able to drift over a wide valley on the asteroid by a little thrust of its boosters. We are not even talking about &quot;why&quot; these vehicles were armed with heavy guns.<br />Now about the actors: Liv Tyler is a fine young woman, although not a fine young actress. Bruce Willis as her father is like Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ghandi. Overall the entire cast seemed to not really know what they actually should be portraying, so the fault might not be on the actors, but on the bad storyline.<br />If this movie would not pretend that it has to be taken serious, you could actually enjoy it - as a movie rental for a boring Saturday night. But if you are into patriotism go for it, anyway.
B0000560RV|2.0|Each song seems to be one or MAYBE two kind of neat, but really simple parts, played over and over ad infinitum... A wee bit cheezy, too, methinks. Sorry, but I was expecting MUCH more.

B000002G23|5.0|There is no need to buy all the individual albums or the greatest hits compilations of The Police. All you need is this set. It has everything that The Police ever released, from the debut single &quot;Fallout&quot; in 1977, to their final group recording in 1986. You will also get all the B-sides plus other oddities and live versions that have cropped up on New Wave compilations and the Brimstone and Treacle soundtrack. Plus a 68 page book packed with photos and essays about each member of the group, plus more. This is a superb set, and a must have for Police fans everywhere.
6300268993|4.0|Superman the Movie opens with Jor-El (Marlon Brando) condeming the three criminals into the Phantom Zone. This of course serves as the base to Superman II-and serves it well. Christopher Reeve returns as the Man of Steel, who once more shows his affections to Lois Lane, (Margot Kidder) and to the point of giving up his superpowers for her. Laudable, but most ill timed, since the three criminals of the late great planet Krypton escape from the Phantom Zone by a nuclear detonation in space. Once free, General Zod (Terence Stamp), the mute Non (Jack O'Halloran), and the beautiful-yet evil-Ursa (Sarah Douglas), set out to conquer Earth. Generally, the movie has the fine elements of the Original, and are carried over smoothy into this sequel. Also, the performace of Christopher Reeve is, once more, an inspiration for all the see. But...it is my suspicion that some of grandure of the Original was lost when Richard Donner was removed by the Salkinds, and replaced by Richard Lester (Hard Days Night is his claim to fame???). I think what Lester tries to do is inject an ill dose of comedy into the movie-of which only serves as a type of poison (Case in point, the guy talking on the phone during the Kryptonian induced hurricane: Silly). This kind of ATTEMPTED comedy only gets worse come Superman III. But again, overall, the movie is very good, and worthy of a place on the VHS/DVD libary of any home.        <br />Parting thought: Speaking of Superman III, like Darth Vader turning good in Return of the Jedi, I think Ursa turning good, and getting together with Superman would have made a fine story for the third movie, if you ask me...
068484267X|5.0|When I first saw \\"Angela's Ashes\\" in the store, it did not look all that interesting, though I wondered if the author was any relation to Malachy McCourt (the greatest talk-show host in the history of radio).  When I found out that Frank McCourt was Malachy's older brother, I bought \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" and read it as soon as I finished Malachy's memoir, [[ASIN:B0007RDOSG A Monk Swimming : A Memoir]].    I was glad I did.  It turned out that Frank is an even better writer than Malachy, and that the two books complement each other very nicely.  Both books make fascinating reading, as does Frank's second book, [[ASIN:B000CC49IK Tis: A Memoir]]    Frank and Malachy McCourt were born in United States, but brought up in County Limerick, Ireland, in abject, grinding poverty that caused the death of their sister and two younger brothers.  If you can read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" without tears coming to your eyes, then you are thicker-skinned than I.    It is an inspiration and a tribute to Frank and Malachy that both eventually overcame their dysfunctional early lives.  Unfortunately, it took Malachy much longer than it did Frank.    The horrors recounted in \\"Angela's Ashes\\" are reminiscent of the very different horrors experienced by Waris Dirie, as told in her excellent autobiography, [[ASIN:1860497586 Desert Flower]], also well worth reading.    watziznaym@gmail.com

B000002N25|5.0|Like Sting, Mark Knopfler defies categorization. He incorporates  so many different musical genres into his music, it is really quite an adventure to listen to this album. From hard rocking songs like &quot;Imelda&quot;, with it's unlikely lyrics about Imelda Marcos, to Celtic tinged songs like &quot;Darling Pretty&quot; which even uses unusual instruments like the bouzouki and Irish harp, to the fun toe-tapping song &quot;Cannibals&quot;. The lyrics to his songs always have a story to tell, be it a love story or an adventure story, this album ranks up there with my favourites. It is a real work of genius!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Phil Collins is a man who needs no introduction.  He has been singing and recording music, with and without Genesis, for nearly thirty-five years. This is an excellent collection of some of his greatest singles as a solo artist including one new track, &quot;True Colors&quot;.<br />I became interested in Phil's music shortly before I began high school.  From the time I got my first Genesis album, I knew I had to own all of his recordings, those that made the pop charts and those that didn't.  It took me five years worth of Christmases and birthdays to acquire them all. (I plan to get the Genesis Archive 2 boxed set sometime in 2001.)<br />Needless to say, this album brings back a lot of memories.  Phil was literally the soundtrack of my high school years.  After I taught myself to play &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot; on the piano---and sing while I played it---completely out of the blue---I was so thrilled that I had to share it with my school choir. That same year, since I had a lot of friends in that choir who were graduating before I was, I told them: &quot;Wouldn't you agree/baby, you &amp; me/got A Groovy Kind of Love.&quot;  &quot;Sussudio&quot; was the nickname I once gave to a girl I was madly in love with.  Those are just a few examples.<br />What I love most about the music of Phil Collins is that he continues to surprise me.  Just when you think you've got his game all figured out, he turns around and does something entirely unexpected.  Who would have thought that after the commercial failure of &quot;Both Sides&quot; (really a shame, since for the first time he sings every vocal line and plays every instrument) he would bounce back in 1996 with &quot;Dance Into the Light&quot;?  Or that he would take the &quot;Tarzan&quot; soundtrack and turn out tremendous honors for &quot;You'll Be In My Heart&quot;?<br />&quot;Hits&quot; is a must for every Phil Collins fan you know.  Happy 50th Birthday in 2001, Phil!
0761118411|5.0|My husband and I look forward to buying this calendar every year since I bought it 3 years ago. It sits on our bathroom counter so we see it and think about the postive affirmation for the day, every single day when we get ready. I can't even toss the past days-- I send them to friends or give them to my hubby in his briefcase as reminders for staying on track with our individual goals as well as our goals as a family.  I also will look in my drawer of past days to find one that fits a particular problem or sadness for me, and it really, really helps to put things into perspective. Daily stress and life events take there toll, and having such simple and concise positive words to ponder, makes a hard-to-believe difference in our lives. Sincerely- I have never written a review before, but when I couldn't find this calendar at the usual bookstores, I raced to amazon to get asap!  Can't start the millenium without this one. Positive!

B00004ZAV3|4.0|Yet ANOTHER Beatles collection, this time of their &quot;number ones&quot; (that explains all the media genuflecting that took place in November).  Still, for introducing the Fab Four to BSB/Britney/'N Sync lovin' young'uns. &quot;1&quot; can't be beat.  Diehards are no doubt squabbling over the selection of songs, but the collection, which starts with the nursery rhyme cadences of &quot;Love Me Do,&quot; and finishes up with the gorgeous &quot;The Long And Winding Road,&quot; will have kids questioning their parents (and in my case, a Gen-X'er questioning her Baby Boomer husband) about the impact John, Paul, George and Ringo had on modern pop.  All of these songs are familiar singalongs, and the sound quality will have casual fans enjoying new nuances to old favorites--and maybe exploring the Beatles' catalog a bit further.
0451151224|5.0|This book reads at an amazing, and I mean amazing pace.  I suggest it for anyone that wants something to read on a flight, or long car ride, because you'll be finished in a sitting.  You'll have no other choice.  It roars right out of the gate at the opening page, and steadily accelerates right up until you get to the last 50 pages or so, when it is suddenly forced into Mach 3, and is tearing you toward what I believe to be the best ending for a King book there is. (The ending of Running man may share that spot with the ending of Thinner, but this is a subject on which I am currently debating with myself, and hope to have a conclusion to soon)  The Bachman books always have grim, but strangely satisfying endings, because they generally contain a twist during the last few stretches, or give you a deeply troubling feeling that you will carry for days after you finish, or, more likely than not, have potential for a little bit of both.   If you have never read this book, or have never read a Bachman, then my advice to you is to put it on your book-buying shoes, grab 10 bucks from the dresser, and head down to your local bookstore for a copy of this fantastic read.  You won't be sorry.
B0000027I6|5.0|It is my recommendation that this CD is perfect for the times when people get into the kinds of dark moods that make them say, &quot;The world is going right down the tubes!&quot;<br />The title &quot;Amused to Death&quot; is lifted from a rather famous article on the effects of television by Neil Postman.  In fact, it's easy to draw the conclusion that all of the songs are about television, even if only in an indirect manner, because TV sounds can frequently be heard in each song.<br />Certain tracks might actually be described as focusing on a particular aspect of TV viewing  For instance:<br />&quot;What God Wants, Part II&quot;---TV evangelism.<br />&quot;Watching TV&quot;---the Tianemen Square Massacre.<br />&quot;The Bravery of Being Out of Range&quot;---war coverage.<br />&quot;Amused to Death&quot; (title cut)---watching too much TV in general.<br />&quot;It's a Miracle&quot;---the ways in which a mass media world destroys cultural differences and diversities rather than enlightens them.<br />Roger Waters may not be the best singer in the world, but in the case of this CD, as well as &quot;Radio KAOS&quot;, &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, and many others which he had a role in making, it's the message that counts, not the singing technique.
6305075468|5.0|I have to agree with what another viewer wrote and say that what I believe made this such a scary film comes from our childhood fears. Watching this movie late at night and alone. I cannot tell you how wrapped up in the musical soundtract as well as the &quot;dark&quot; photography I got. It was incredible and some of the scenes are just sooooo well done. When the Harker character seeks out the coffin of the vampire and sees count Orlok peering out of a crack in the coffin it is positively freightening. Another incredible scene is later on the ship when a crew member goes below to destroy the count. He starts hacking at the cargo and out comes the rats after he busts a hole in the crate and straight as a pole rises count orlok out of his coffin. The counts rat like appearance, long finger nails and huntch back gives him a most gruesome look. He reminds me of the perverted lurker on a street corner who snatches children. As another viewer put it,he offers the audiance &quot;dangerous candy&quot; that is difficult to resist. It is the first film in years to give me nightmares. If you love classic films or are a true collector into the horror genre, get this film.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Fred Durst can write some really powerful material, and this album goes to prove it. Unfortunately, most of his other work on this album is less than desirable. On Chocolate Starfish, Limp Bizkit seems to completely divide their rock-rap personality, causing most of the tracks to either be flat out rock or flat out rap. In some cases, this style works out great. The rest of the time, however, the result is a mindless, highly annoying peice of rap or hip-hop. <br />The highlights of the album consist mostly of the hard rock material, which even by itself has a wide variety. There's the incredibly funny (and offensive) track &quot;Hot Dog,&quot; and the fist version of &quot;Rollin,&quot; a great mosh pit song to follow in the steps of &quot;Nookie.&quot; Along with these are what I consider to be Limp Bizkits greatest songs, the incredibly powerful &quot;Take A Look Around,&quot; which proves once and for all that when Fred puts his mind to it, he can write a song that not only flat out rocks but also has depth and emotion to it. The other gem on this album is &quot;Hold On,&quot; and incredibly emotional song like nothing Limp Bizkit has ever done before. &quot;The One&quot; is also one of the better tracks.<br />Unfortunately, with the good comes the bad, and there is quite a bit of bad on this CD. &quot;My Generation&quot; is tolerable, although after hearing 100+ times on the radio I got a little sick of it. Other bombs include the obnoxious, lyrically uninspired songs &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; and &quot;Livin' It Up,&quot; not to mention the second version of &quot;Rollin,&quot; mindlessly remixed with guest rappers to make an irritating, pointless song. <br />If Limp Bizkit had stayed a bit more consistent on this album like they had on Three Dollar Bill Y'All$ and Significant Other, then this would have been a better CD. The musical content is very good, but the lyrical content is what brings that quiality of the album down. If Fred would write lyrics suchas he did for &quot;Hold On&quot; all the time, then this would definitely be a 5-star album. Instead, you have a collection of really good and really poor songs. Still, despite the low points, I do believe that &quot;Take A Look Around,&quot; &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;Rollin (Air Raid Vehicle)&quot; make this album worth your money, even if you aren't a big Limp Bizkit fan.

B00004TWZF|1.0|I too, like many, loved the original soundtrack (Bill Conti) I recently purchased the DVD with great anticipation and was sadly disappointed.   I was unaware that there were two different soundtracks.    I found the Eric Serra score to be intrusive and overbearing.  I own two of the VHS with the original score and I suppose I will have to get a VHS player again so I can enjoy this wonderful movie.   Please reconsider before purchasing a DVD version of this film.   If you loved the movie when it was released you will probably not enjoy the DVD edition.

1559409010|5.0|This movie has been around for a while and it is still hilarious. The extras included on the criterion dvd are well worth the higher cost.  Perhaps the modern day Christian pharisees wrapped in their smug self righteousness will find this movie offensive or sacreligous, but do these Holy rollers watch movies anyway? If you haven't seen it, you should.  This movie and &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; are two of the comedy classics of the late 20th century. Too bad they cut out the scenes with Otto.  The only part I don't care for is the spaceship. The Pythons are all in top form in this movie, especially John Cleese.  Enough said!
B00003CXBK|5.0|'Princess Mononoke' is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I watch a LOT of movies. It is a hauntingly beautiful film, from the storyline and characterisation to the music to the visual style itself. It deals realistically with human existence and life itself, defying one to pigeonhole characters into simplistic generalisations of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil.&quot; Upon absorbing the whole of the story, it is difficult to not have compassion for even the most seemingly selfish characters: it is clear to see that they rob themselves and fail to experience true joy and harmony in their self-absorption. <br />On a technical basis, I would strongly recommend watching the film with the original Japanese voices with subtitles. The dubbed version lacks a great deal in the translation, and the English voice actors are without exception truly horrid (particularly Billy Bob Thornton, in what will likely be the most incredibly miscast role of his career, whose portrayal is studied to the point of severe irritation). <br />That aside, I highly recommend this for *anyone*, not just fans of anime.
B00004XQ83|5.0|At first I was thinking: why even review this? I suspected that most people wouldn't need the help of a review when deciding whether to buy this particular CD--they probably saw the movie and realized at about thirty seconds in to &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; that they had to have the soundtrack. But then I thought, people might be taking a look over the track list because of one or two favorite artists, trying to decide if they really want to take the plunge. If that description fits you: don't hesitate. Buy it. This is perhaps the most sublime compilation ever arranged of Americana: a mix of folk, blues, bluegrass, and gospel music, the full effect of which transcends period or genres. After getting this, I have about three or four new artists on my wish list for buying new CDs.<br />Outstanding tracks are both vocal versions of &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow,&quot; &quot;Down In The River To Pray,&quot; &quot;O Death,&quot; &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues,&quot; and &quot;I'll Fly Away,&quot; but you can listen to this from beginning to end, over and over, and not easily tire. As someone else pointed out, this is not like other soundtrack CDs--there are no weak links or unevenness here, no filler. Every cut is grade-A choice. Some, in fact, are dangerously addictive. I've owned the CD less than a day and played &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; about twenty times now. I feel like a rat pushing its lever again and again to get a buzz of sheer bliss.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I heard this cd and i thought it was a total piece of trash i gave it to a friend. The lyrics do not mean anything the whole cd is the f word and it totally gets annoying im not saying im against swearing but just way too much sucks, if you want a good rock band get STP, godsmack, korn, sevendust, linkin park, these are alot better than any chocolate starfishes or hot dog flavored water, amazon needs to let people put 0 stars even though this cd deserves negative 5
0316777722|2.0|I hate to say it, but I'm tossing the Sedaris book aside.  I find it absolutely dreadful--not to mention boring.  Several people recommended the book which surprises me.  He's unfunny.  I'm tired, too, of the repressed-boy-homo theme that so many gay men like to write about.  Yawn!
B00004RFCM|4.0|As a fan of &quot;Sex and The City&quot; since the start, it has been interesting going back to this DVD of the first season of this HBO comedy series.  Having now wrapped its third season (and being catapulted from &quot;cult&quot; status to &quot;it&quot; show), this 2-disc set lets you experience these characters and appreciate how much they have developed over time. While this foursome might easily have fallen into mere stereotype, the writers and actresses have not made sure not to allow that to happen.  This is a smartly-written and perfectly-cast &quot;situation&quot; comedy.<br />I have not noticed any quality issues with this DVD set that others have spoken about in their reviews...but I will likewise admit to not being not enough of an expert being fairly new to DVDs.   The set also includes the wonderful &quot;teaser&quot; commercials for each episode.   The shows definitely hold-up on repeat viewings (an important aspect to me for any DVD/video purchase).<br />As the breeziest half-hour on television today (and the last couple of years), I recommend the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; set to any fans or the series or those who might not have HBO.  With the apparent success of this release, I look forward to future seasons on DVD as well.  Hopefully, this trend will continue and the traditional &quot;network&quot; television will release other series on DVD (though syndication rights might make that difficult).
0679879269|4.0|I believe this book was just as good as the others in the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; books, although I was angered when Phillip Pullman sort of trashed any religion that believes in one god, or heaven and hell. I also was disappointed at the end of the book, for all of the books had led up to the ending and it left me feeling unfulfilled, because I had such high expectations. But over all, it was a great book that I really couldn't put down!
B00003W8NM|4.0|I know you're not supposed to review other reviewers, only the film itself, but often the best way to get at the heart of a thing is by examining what others have said about it. There's no time or room to look at every opinion, but something that reviewer David Thompson said stood out. While he liked Fight Club, he seemed a little condescending and frankly quite detached and rationalistic, even going so far as to say right off the bat that Fight Club is not as good as Clockwork Orange. Right away he identified himself as one of those detached intellectual types and for a work of art like Fight Club, if you wanna call it that, that at least tries to be visceral, this is no way to approach it. In another place, Thompson says &quot;I usually dislike movies with a strong anti-Capitalist message. This is the economic system which has greatly improved the lives of many throughout the world.&quot; This statement reveals a certain predjudice that is not at all useful for a critic. Firstly, Fight Club does not criticize capitalism per se, so much as its adverse effects. And if Thompson is suggesting that capitalism, because of the &quot;good&quot; it has done, is beyond criticism and without fault then he is not quite so rational as he'd like us to think (I'm sure that faulting his rationalism is probably the most hurtful thing imaginable to such an intellectual). Who can deny that Capitalism carries with it a class structure that leaves many worthwhile people at the bottom rungs of society, where I can assure you that life does indeed become a painful, barely liveable affair. The main target of Fight Club is not capitalism itself but those people at the higher rungs that have become complascent (sp?) in their easy lifestyle. Not only that, but the very negative, destructive, evil results that occur when a capitalistic society forgets to examine itself and admit its flaws and faults. In one scene, Tyler Durden terrorizes a harmless shopkeep with a gun (empty gun, that is), demanding that he pursue his dream of becoming an animal doctor. Is this an anti-capitalistic message? No, it's pro-capitalist in a way. This shows us that Tyler's &quot;message&quot; is that people should refuse to allow themselves to be beaten down by the system, instead to strive to succeed within it rather than assume the lowly positions assigned to them. It isn't capitalism that Fight Club rails against, it's the class system that it creates that is the true enemy. Not only that, but the emasculating effects it wields. This is NOT fascist film, it is more an anarchistic film. It is about the dignity of the individual, not the creation of a faceless mass. The negative results of Tyler's revolution do become fascistic, but this is not the intention, it is what happens when the movement becomes corrupt and loses its way. In the end, this negative result isn't lauded, the world we are left with at the end is absurd, out of control. Now, do I like this film? yes. but I didn't love it. I can assure those reviewers out there who wondered if people like these shown in Fight Club really exist because I am one and I have waited and searched long and hard for a film that spoke of certain feelings that I and many people I know share. Fight Club comes as close as anything has (much closer than Clockwork Orange, which I find a little too removed and intellectualized to have any true power, other than to jaded armchair critics) but it still lacks a lot. Many of us out there at the bottom rungs of society are sick and tired of the dehumanizing lifestyle we lead as a result of rampant capitalism and a class system that destroys the souls of all but the most successful and frankly we are more than ready and willing to throw a few monkey wrenches into the system. This doesn't mean we want to destroy the system so much as wake it up to its own absurdity and often negative side effects. That's why I didn't think Fight Club was as great as many others thought. There's plenty room forcriticism. Still, it did speak to me somewhat and guys like Thompson (I'm sure he lives fairly comfortably on a university stipend) and others like him are just lost when reviewing this film. If there's any message to Fight Club you might say that it is for those who have been blessed by the capitalistic system to give a little more respect and consideration to their supposed underlings. Otherwise, you may find just what sort of power we dishwashers, janitors, mechanics, cashiers, theatre ushers, garbage collectors and night watchmen wield. We're more than happy to do your dirty work, just don't treat us like crap and everything will be just fine.
B00004Z459|1.0|Back in my nu-metal days these guys were kinda intersting because they had a few interesting melodies that seperated themselves from other Rap/Rock bands. But since Ive gotten into the ultra heavy and talent filled genre of Melodic Death Metal, and only now do I realise the simplicity of bands like Linkin Park. Power chords fill up each song, with a constant use of scratching. The singer even pulls out boy band vocals on a few songs. Song structure is all too simple and the guitar work is 4 million miles from anything resembling something technical or difficult. Bass is hardly audible on any song. Yawn...
0783221487|3.0|That film is a superb adaptation of Frank Herbert's first novel of his Dune series. We could of course harp a lot about the symbolism of names, the Fremen being free men, and the Harkonnen having a Germanic name, and the Atreides having a Greek sounding name, and the Emperor having an Arab name, and we could also add that the witches, the Bene Gesserit have a Latin sounding name, etc. We could also said that the name of the hero, Muad'dib also sounds Arabic, or is it Hindi, though the frequent aspirated `h' of this latter language is absent from this writing and pronouncing. But that is superficial and the worst name and being is not present in this film and book, the real Arabs, the Sligs, the hybrid of a giant slug and a pig, who are the direct reflection and mirror image of the caricature of the sly Arab living by the sharia so common in the West. What is interesting in this volume and film is the political intrigues along with the prophetic dimension of the plot. The political intrigues revolves around the Greek sounding Atreides, the honest ones from a planet of oceans and rain; the Germanic sounding Harkonnen, the rotten (actually rotting) polluting industrial ones who are violent, vicious and sadistic, slightly vampiristic too; the Persian sounding Emperor Shaddam, bringing together the Shah of Iran and all the Saddams of the Arab world; the Spacing Guild that controls the universe by controlling travelling in that universe; and finally the Fremen, an underground free species of human beings who believe in a prediction of a Messiah and are mostly invisible on the planet Dune. The Bene Gesserit is also present with their plan to produce the perfect new Messiah, God, Savior through genetic manipulations by guiding the reproductive schemes among the powerful from whom the Messiah can only come. He will nevertheless come for sure, but by accident and thanks to the alliance of Paul Atreides, the last representative of the Atreides House, his Bene-Gesserit-trained mother and the Fremen. Some will see in it the caricature of the world in the Cold War. Of course we have to know one thing that is not immediately clear: the fact that this world is the heir of the Butlerian Jihad that destroyed all thinking machines and then banned the construction of such machines, forcing human beings to develop their skills at calculating and thinking to keep the control over things. But this vision is slightly short. It goes beyond and it reaches the level of a reflection on what politics are: a fight among a very few superior leaders who are essential born as such and vaguely accepted by some managing more than governing council. Democracy is the value that is totally absent from this story. Even the Fremen are not democratic since they believe in a supreme leader, a messiah, and their actions are mostly mass-reactions, extremely collective methods of governing and controlling their own people. That future world then will not be different from the old feudal world of six or seven centuries ago. The people, the mass of people necessary for those constant wars and feuds, are nothing but pawns that die on the screen and in the sand of Dune without any kind of concern for their lives or even simply life. They are non-entities, including on the winning side of the Fremen. That world is dehumanized and does not defend any kind of ideal or principle. The film is perfect though with its special effects and its immense cosmic and desertic scenery. The film is very dense and thus the suspense is quite effective. The film then is nothing but an action film with good situations and interesting characters, be they heroes or be they monsters. This vision of the world remains rather primitive though and maybe even lower than what could be normal expectations. It satisfies though the desire for survival and victory over danger that lurks in the circumvolutions of the human brain. That's probably why this film, and the books behind, still have a positive lifein our culture. Messianic characters and situations contrasted to apocalyptic treachery will always be a favorite of the human mind.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDin our culture.

B00004XOWM|2.0|This CD is horrible albeit a few points. &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; is probably Limp's last great stand. But I think these guys have seriously sold out to MTV. Anyone seen the video for &quot;Rollin&quot;? Fred in a ballroom with girl dancers. Im sorry but this is to N'Sync or Britney Spears to be metal/rap. And yes, I did listen to the lyrics, but Im sorry. When Fred sais the &quot;F&quot; Word after every sentence, it gets pretty rediculous. 3-Dollar Bill was Limps best album and even Signifigant Other was good. But i think this CD really lacks power. Ill give props to Wes because he is in my opinion one of the best guitar players of any metal band today (aside from Kirk of Metallica). Unfortunately Limp will be praised by every TRL fan out there and this CD will succeed. Oh well....lets see where Korn goes.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is simply the funniest book ever written.  It is, in places, a deeply dark satire of the futility of war; where the lives of ordinary men are risked for the unattainable ideals and pointless pursuits of others.  The reason that this book is so impossible to put down is that one moment it will have you rolling on the floor in laughing hysterically and the next  crying uncontrollably over the tradgedy of the characters' situation.  If I could only own one book, it would unquestionably be this one.  If you read it once you'll read it a thousand times.  Buy, read, enjoy. (Once you've read this you might like to visit: clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/yossarianlives  to chat to other fans)
B00003CX6P|1.0|This is a well made thriller with some great acting. Be warned, if homosexuality offends you, you will be offended. Much of the complexity of the film is the result of Mr. Ripley's emotional struggle with his desires for a man who is straight.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I think this CD is very creative and I love everything that Eminem makes. The songs are catchy, the beat is phat, and I love it all. He's unique with his own style and I don't think I've heard of another rapper with so much guts to say what he really thinks. If you don't mind swearing and you want an album that you'll want to listen to over and over again, this one is definetly for you! I can't stop playing it, and I'm sure you won't be able to, either! I give it two thumbs up!
B00004Z459|5.0|This is a great CD but I have to agree with the other guy in saying that the songs all sound pretty similar. In every song there is at least one outburst of screaming but that isn't bad. The lyrics are fast so a rap fan could like the style but there is also a lot of heavy stuff mixed so it's a good buy if you like a quick tempo with heavy guitar. I think the first 4 songs are the best ones and the others follow the same idea and sound. A great CD!
B00003CXIY|4.0|Picture this, you are leaving the safe surrounds of high school to enter the unknown realm of university, being wise you decide to visit what could be potentially be your place of study, partying and security for the next three years, so you take the campus tour to get acquainted with the grounds as well as meet some new people. Sounds perfect, right? Wrong! Your tour guide is non-other than MTV shock jock and crazy man Tom Green, who in this case is actually named Barry Manilow. What results is the telling of a tale of the most time honoured campus tradition, the ROAD TRIP. So begins the story of four guys who embark on a three-day ROAD TRIP to retrieve a video containing highly sensitive material before it lands into the wrong hands and creates total havoc. Their journey is riddled with numerous encounters of both strange people and incidents that will ultimately affect/scar them forever, even if merely on a superficial level. <br />Whilst the film is aimed at a predominately teenage audience, it will prove to be thoroughly enjoyable to an audience of 15 to 50years of age. However those offended by course language, sexual references and gratuitous female nudity are advised to steer clear, as the unrated dvd edition of ROAD TRIP goes that little bit further than its theatrical version.<br />On that note, let me give you a rundown on the dvd itself. The film is featured for the first time in its complete uncut, uncensored and unrated edition, which basically breaks down to a few scene extensions and alternative shots not contained in the theatrical release actually incorporated into the movie itself. As this is the US import, you have a choice of either a DTS 5.1 soundtrack or the standard Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (my preference as I got a DD 5.1 set-up at home). The picture remains in its original theatrical ratio of 1.85:1, which some will consider to be quite a bonus during one particular sequence in the film (ie. the obligatory shower scene). In terms of special features, the disc contains seven deleted scenes aptly titled `Road Kills', a behind the scenes featurette hosted by Tom Green called `Ever Been On A Road Trip', a music video by the Eels `Mr E's Beautiful Blues' and two theatrical trailers, all this in addition to the standard cast &amp; crew bios and production notes. An audio commentary by with director Todd Phillips, executive producer Ivan Reitman and comedian/star Tom Green would have been awesome but you've to be grateful for what you get and all in all its an awesome package.<br />Film: 8/10 Extras: 8/10 Overall: 8/10
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is perhaps one of the greatest works of art that I have ever seen.  The animation is truly gorgeous for everything from the people, to the animals, and the landscape.  The plot becomes extremely in-depth as the movie progresses, and the characters are never absolutely good or evil.  The lines between the two often times become blurry.  As for the characters themselves, their personalities are shaped so deeply that they become more than drawn sprites on the screen.  The music is incredibly powerful making the experience even more gripping.  This was definitely made for the mature movie-goer that thirsts for something more than the feeble attempts at good animated classics from Disney.  This is not a movie, but an experience.
B000002HH9|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best song the Cure have ever composed.  This album deserves four stars just for this song alone, but Jupiter Crash pumps it up to five.<br />Think I'm an idiot, just listen to the two.
B00003CX7L|5.0|This sequence is much better than Toy Story 1. In Toy story 1, only two protagonists (Buzz light year and Hooper) had clear personality, while here in this sequence almost every character has his own sound. I love the dinosaur and the tourist guide Babie in the toy shop as well as the Mr. And Mrs. Potato. The neat idea of some classic scenes related to other hot movies (Jurassic park and Star wars) make me laughter to tears. And the storyline is much mature than the previous one. And the music is excellent, the song sung by the female cowboy is very moving. It seems that Toy story can develop into infinite series... Maybe next year in Toy story 3 Andy's little sister buys the tour-guide Babie or something...
B00003CX9W|1.0|The 1940 movie &quot;Fantasia&quot; is awesome - one of the best animated films of all time. A definite five star film.<br />Unfortunately, the DVD contains an altered version of the movie. To make matters even worse, the advertising for the DVD is deliberately false.<br />First of all, the DVD is being advertised as being &quot;uncut.&quot; This is not true. In reality, certain scences that some people consider to be &quot;offensive&quot; have been removed.<br />Secondly, the DVD is being advertised as having &quot;the original narration.&quot; This is also untrue. In reality, this DVD contains a newly recorded narration.
0064400018|4.0|An excellent story of a &quot;pioneer&quot; family and how they lived in the latter part of the 19th century.  Everything they needed to survive was provided for them by the resourcefulness of their father and mother.  Mr. Ingalls was a very talented and energetic man and always made his family feel comfortable and protected.  He was an excellent provider of food, water and shelter.  Nothing ever discouraged him.  If things didn't go the way he expected, he just found another way to get it done.  He always found a way to turn adversity around.  Mrs. Ingalls was a caring and loving mother who also was talented in the ways of housekeeping, cooking, sewing and creating a loving atmosphere in the home.  The children were given responsibilities from a very early age and there were strict rules of discipline and manners that they were expected to adhere to.  In the evening, the father would take out his fiddle and play songs for the family.  It was a loving and happy home!
B000050XEI|5.0|I think Enya is just a genious. She stays true to her selfe, is original and still sell a lot of albums in a society that is not used to New Age music. I think that expecting a madonna out of every artist is too much to ask for. And if you are a good listener you will find that Enya is not the same old thing. This music will make you stop and relax from the speede pace of this century. It's like food for the soul.
B000003TAR|5.0|Kurt has been gone for six long years now, but this cd stands out as one of their boldest and best recordings. Kurt released so much of his inner fears and sadnesses through his music, and this cd is a fine result. He died,among other reasons, because he felt so sorry for us and he loved us all simply because we were people. Songs like Rape Me dont advocate rape, they stand as a protest to the horrible things that people did that the hated. If you like Nirvana get this cd. Kurt's emotions are released through the music on this cd and he felt very strongly about everything he put in his music. You'll like this one - trust me its great! This is a fine reminder to the glory and music of Nirvana.
B000002UB3|5.0|i laugh at the stupidity of my generation for saying they don't like the beatles because it's old music how stupid is that.to young people beatle music isnt old its new because we havent heard it for years and years like the older generations have.beatles music is for the ages not just the aged.rock of ages!i feel sorry for the people who put down the beatles because they will never know what great music is and its truly sad.of course there are some young people that do know about them and listen but most don't,they would rather listen to fall out boy or panic at the disco and think that is the best music ever.the beatles music will not be forgotton it will outlive all those new groups making music right now,and will outlive you and me and your kids and thats what great music does it stands the test of time as the beatles have done.
B00004TH83|5.0|The average review of the album &quot;Lara Fabian&quot; by Lara Fabian is one that describes bland pop songs oversung in a Celine Dion copy cat style.  I say NO WAY.  What is wrong with a singer who has an amazing vocal capability?  Lara Fabian has an amazing voice...period.  The songs on her English Language debut are purely pop.  However, they are performed with such emotion and such perfection, that it's hard to believe she's only debuting now.  Her singing style is similar to Celine Dion.  However Lara has her own sound.  She attacks the songs with fire hitting the high notes with unbelievable force, pitch and duration.  Adagio, the first song, is included in both English and Italian.  Both are absolutely stunning.  Other high points are &quot;You Are My Heart&quot; , &quot;To Love Again&quot; , &quot;I Will Love Again&quot; and &quot;I am WHo I am&quot;.  It's true that there are more ballads on the album than uptempo/dance tracks.  That's the only downfall. The slower numbers are wonderful, it's just that after a while, you'd like a fast track.  Too bad she didn't have a more even distribution.  However, if you enjoy vocalists like Celine or Mariah, you'll love Lara.  She is a very expressive and creative talent.  Check out her BEAUTIFUL french albums...WOW.  THe voice carries the songs and touches your heart.  This album is a must have for the pop-diva vocalist fan.  It is a very solid collection beautifully sung.  Each track has the potential to be a hit song.  It's rare that an album be so consistent. I'm sure Lara will be a worldwide superstar soon enough with this release.
B00003CXE7|4.0|This is a very good, well acted movie. The story centers around a general in the Roman legion who is enslaved and becomes a gladiator of reknown, called the Spaniard.<br />The general, Maximus, esteemed by all the legionaires that he commands, is a favorite of the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. The Emporer has a son, Commodus, and a daughter, Lucilla. While Lucilla is clearly the worthier of the two to inherit her father's empire upon his death, she cannot by virtue of her gender. The Emperor knows his son to be unworthy to rule in his stead, as Commodus is totally devoid of character and craven. So, Marcus Aurelius, knowing that his health is failing, tells Maximus of his wish to declare him protector of Rome upon his death, in hopes of returning Rome to the people, as a Republic. Unfortunately, Marcus Aurelius makes the mistake of telling his son the same, thereby bringing about his death at the hands of Commodus.<br />Commodus, now Emporer, extends the olive branch to Maximus who refuses, knowing that something unsavory has happened to Marcus Aurelius, for whom he had great affection. Rebuffed, Commodus has Maximus arrested with an order for his execution, as well as the ravaging of his lands and the slaughter of his wife and small son. Maximus escapes execution, but does not make it home in time to save his family. Captured by slave traders, he is sold and becomes a gladiator known as the Spaniard. This is all I will tell you about the plot. Watch the movie and see for yourself.<br />Suffice to say that Russell Crowe gives a masterful and powerful perfomance as Maximus. Yet, I think Joaquin Phoenix gives an extraordinary performance as the the evil and sinister Commodus. His role is not a majestic, heroic one, but for that reason alone, his performance is, to my mind, the more compelling one, as it is stangely moving. If there are any Oscar recognized performances to be eked out of this film, he should certainly receive strong consideration for best supporting actor.  As to the special effects, I was disappointed because, at times, the special effects were noticable; that is, you could occasionally tell when special effects were being employed. It does not necessarily detract from the film; it is just a little jarring to be aware of it.<br />All in all, however, it is a film well worth seeing.actor.

B00003CWL6|5.0|he is no james dean but i dont think that he could be criticised for his acting ability. once again this movie proves that a self absorbed bloated american director would have turned this prize buffet into christmas turkey. a great film owed to sam mendes and kevin spacey. american directors should stick to tearing omaha beach to shreads. to make a truly darkly humourous film without using excessive force as tarrantino showed the world, you have to come from one of the most depressing populous in the world england. mendes has shown something universal in american suburbia that is always hidden (discounting john lynchs blue velvet) with flowers, beaver cleaver, and picket fences. this film could have oh so easily become drool and paedophilia laced with pink floyd. but as we do say or used to say on the isle of the angles &quot;turned out nice again.&quot; Or not so nice again the complexity and the lies are the most entertaining you look forward to the sarcasm and are almost annoyed with the gunshot.
B0000560RV|4.0|Sigur Ros are an excellent, if somewhat weird, band that plays a puzzling blend of rock, dream pop and post-rock. Given that they are from Island you'd expect them to sing in Icelandic but in fact they've &quot;invented&quot; (or maybe someone has already used it before them) their own language wich they call Hopelandic or something like that. If you want a couple of guidelines to classify them just think about a rocky version of the Cocteau Twins with whom they've much in common in my opinion. The vocals are &quot;soaring&quot; and sung in a falsetto voice while the overall atmosphere is &quot;dreamy&quot; and warm. I've also heard echoes of mogwai...

079070546X|5.0|With apologies to Jimmy Stewart and Ralphie Parker, this is my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  If you are reading this because you have never seen &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot;, stop right now and go to the video store and rent it.  Then come back here and order your own copy because you'll want to watch it over and over again each holiday season.<br />The undisputed gem of the National Lampoon 'Vacation' series, the plot can be summed up very simply:  idealistic family man Clark Griswold wants to host the perfect old-fashioned fun family Christmas.  As all of us idealistic family men have discovered, there is no such thing as a perfect holiday, and that just about sums it up.  The appeal of this film is that we can all relate to the disasters that holidays can become, regardless of how well-meaning we are and how hard we work to achieve them.  <br />The cast is terrific.  Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen) are back as the Griswolds, with Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki assuming the roles of Audrey and Rusty.  John Randolph and Diane Ladd are Clark's parents, while E.G. Marshall and the ultimate mother-in-law, Doris Roberts are Ellen's parents.  Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss are Todd and Margo, the yuppie neighbors.  William Hickey and Mae Questel (the voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl) nearly steal the show as Uncle Lewis and senile Aunt Bethany.  Randy Quaid does steal the show - his &quot;cousin-in-law&quot; Eddie is one of the all-time great characters in recent comedy history.<br />The self-inflicted situations that befall Clark in his holiday quest are peppered with memorable dialogue and slapstick, yet believable enough to bring flickers of recognition to most viewers.  Witness his mishaps on the roof putting up the lights; getting trapped in the attic; spending his Christmas bonus before he gets it; dealing with his snooty neighbors; and getting hilariously tongue-tied at the lingerie counter and being remarkably eloquent when he gets his &quot;bonus&quot;.  Admit it.  We've all been there.<br />A holiday movie should be one that holds up to repeated viewings, and this one does.  Besides the excellent cast and the familiar situations, there is a great score by Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks), the animated opening credits sequence, and some fine tunes such as &quot;Hey Santa Claus&quot; by the Moonglows!  There are numerous little touches that you might not catch the first several times - check out the shape of the packages in Mr. Shirley's office when Clark gives him his gift, and see what happens to the light bulbs Clark puts in the cart at the Wal-Mart.<br />I suspect, like in our home, &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; has become a sort of institution in many homes each holiday season.  We like to get together with friends to watch it, with everyone dressing as a character from the movie.  We eat green jello with &quot;cat food&quot; in it, stand and join in the Pledge of Allegiance and the Star Spangled Banner, recite the lines along with the characters, and give thanks that our holidays are at least a little better than the Griswolds'.
630575067X|1.0|That's about all you'll get out of this movie. No story, stupid dialogue, just special effects. Nothing else happens. Not enough to sustain this movie for more than a minute.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead's latest release &quot;Kid A&quot; is a true testament to what music is truly about.  Music is created by and for the soul, and I believe the only way to describe &quot;Kid A&quot;, is to call it a soul album.   I love this record. The first track's title &quot;Everything in it's Right Place&quot; sums up the entire album.  Radiohead takes a single and simple rif and extends it in to 5 minutes of brilliance, displayed in the spacey jazz track &quot;National Anthem&quot;, and in the beautifully depressing &quot;How to Dissapear Completely&quot;, which is followed by 3 and a half minutes of feedback. I don't want to ramble on and on about details if Kid A, which I could write an entire dissertation about, so I'll say one last thing.  Radiohead is simply five genius's wrapped in to one driving force that has just begun to pick up momentum and will eventually knock down the walls of POPular music.
6305127638|5.0|This movie went far beyond my expectations for a Star Trek film.  The special effects were amazing, the space battle scenes,the Borg queen,etc. The plot was definitely worthy of the big screen. The Borg, especially the Borg queen, were really creepy and scary. Alice Krige as the seductive and sadistic Borg Queen was amazing, James Cromwell (Zefram Cochran) was very convincing, and Alfre Woodard (Lily)was awsome as usual. Also, the dialogue was the best. Even if you don't like Star Trek, you will really like this movie. My friend that I watched it with  doesn't like Star Trek but he thought the movie was really cool. It was. It's probably best watched on a big screen TV for all the special effects to be fully appreciated.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|And old...I agree with the reviewer that says to &quot;stop whining and just enjoy the music.&quot; <br />What I love about this CD is, of course the wonderful songs, all digitaly remastered. That and the booklet containing a wide selection of 45 sleeves. I think it's great that this CD is selling well everywhere. <br />My closing thought is the fact that I take pleasure in purchasing Beeeattle items that have an official &quot;Apple&quot; logo on it. <br />Here's hoping that one day we'll get a &quot;new&quot; remastered and re-done &quot;Let It Be&quot; with the entire rooftop concert and none of Phil Spector.
6305127638|5.0|Finally they get to swear in a Star Trek movie! I'm happy. Finally they get to really express their emotions.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is Miles' best album ever!  I listen to this all the time.  You can't get any more soulful than &quot;Flamenco Sketches.&quot;  You can almost imagine what was going through his mind as he played the opening improv solo.  Miles is the master!  I'd recommend this to any Davis fan--I've even recommended it to people who had never listened to blues before and they fell for him!  If you've never heard Miles play before, I suggest you start with &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;...you'll fall in love!
B000023VR6|5.0|this cd is a great cd. you usually buy a cd for one or 2 songs. I bought this one for still dre and forgot about dre. but then after listening to it i found several more i liked..... i think this is the best compilation of rap music there has been! i reccomend it.
B00003CXMG|5.0|&quot;Almost Famous&quot; is one of those rare movies that become enjoyed by all generations of people. It isn't a family movie, but the story is very interesting no matter who you are and what your age is (not to mention, it is based on actual events). It shows a common high school student at the time, with common likes and dislikes, and with dreams. Unlike his other friends and enemies, Patrick Fugit's character William Miller gets to live out his dream. I haven't ever met a member of a famous rock group, or seen anything big about their private life, but this movie is very in-depth with the detail to all of the rock stars lives.  It shows the viewers that rock stars are human beings. They do have to face many problems, just like the average citizen. The publicity of rock stars is displayed well. The lives of real rock stars from that time era seem to be very accurate with the movie. From the bonding while on tours to everything else. Patrick Fugit does a convincing performance as a starstruck 15 year old journalist major. He shows respect to everybody and is polite, but acts very emotionally. The movie is funny too and isn't all that explicit.   It is about a rock band of the 70s, and the movie has talk about drugs and sex, but it is more informative than offensive. It wouldn't be the worst thing to let a child watch this, just to let him understand how things were. <br />When March 13 rolls around, I will no-doubt be driving to the mall to get my DVD for &quot;Almost Famous&quot;.
B0000524E5|1.0|I had to add my two cents because reading the good reviews about this movie blew my mind.  They had to have all been written by 13 year old teeny boppers.  I only sat through this movie because the people I went to the theater with needed a ride home.  I was really looking forward to this movie too.  The commercials made it look like it was going to be hot chicks doing wild and crazy stuff at the bar through the whole thing but I'd have to say that only about 15 minutes of this movie took place at the bar.  Piper Perabo annoyed the crap out of me.  She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, &quot;Look how cute and adorable I am.&quot;  The story was trite and cliche'... I actually felt insulted that the director thought I might be stupid enough to buy into this ridiculous crap.  If you aren't a 13 year old girl don't go see this.
B00004U9MS|4.0|First of all about Coldplay, Coldplay's music is from the alternative/indie variety following from such an artisit as Oasis but I must say that it is far from the type of music which Oasis play with more of a gentle approach and not as fast paced as say 'Roll With It' but more like Noel Gallagher's rendition. There songs are quite simular with not much change in variables of the music but it is there first album and the music is still of a highest quality.<br />I would buy the album because of the excellence and many top-notch tunes such as Yellow and the fantastic Trouble which I must say is one of the best tunes of 2000.<br />Overall, the album doesn't have much variety but is fantastic and I'm sure that Coldplay will keep improving in there music and will shine above the rest into the new year.
0061020710|4.0|This poor book has been badly insulted by a number of latter-day Terry Pratchett fans such as myself, people who must shamefacedly admit that we began the Discworld series in the middle with &quot;Small Gods&quot; because of the shiny turtle on its cover.  But &quot;Color of Magic,&quot; the first book in the series, does not deserve such disdain.<br />For the yet untutored fan, &quot;Color&quot; is a great starting point to learn about the Discworld.  The book is short, using most of its plot to describe the geography of the Disc and to introduce the earliest hero of the series, a cowardly and untalented wizard named Rincewhind.  He's a thaumaturgical flop, but a comedic king.<br />Most of the Discworld novels are complex satires of our own world.  &quot;Color&quot; begins, though, as a straight spoof of the fantasy genre.  It isn't even a complete tale without the following novel, &quot;The Light Fantastic.&quot;  But it's the first bright grain of sand in the vast, murkey Nothing.  Pratchett's own imagination was already birthing such wildly beautiful concepts as intelligent luggage and working classed pixies.  Slightly philosophical police already skulk through the fans' beloved city of Ankh-Morpork and try not to be noticed by any criminals.<br />This book stands well enough on its own merit.  It is a fun, Saturday afternoon romp that lets folks laugh at the &quot;in&quot; jokes of the fantasy genre.  Non-Discphiles can file it next to &quot;Bimbos of the Death Sun&quot; by Sharyn McCrumb or &quot;Bored Of the Rings&quot; by Henry Beard and Douglas Kenney.  Pratchett fans can tell themselves that the author has done better.  Sure he has.  The next book was better, and the one after that was jaw-dropping, and the next was eye-popping ... so don't knock &quot;Color of Magic&quot; until you've grokked it.  If you really must be dazzled, go find the book with the shiny turtle on it.
0399146253|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I thought it was great. I do not agree with the bad reviews. It was not a repeat of the other book it went on from there. It was very hard to put down and had a great ending. I love this author and have everyone of her great books.
014028009X|5.0|This novel is one of the funniest books I have ever read.  The way Fielding phrases things is hysterical.  The novel always keeps you interested and throws in people and situations that a lot of people can recognize.  I recommend &quot;Diary&quot; to everyone.  The sequal is also very good.
6304230109|4.0|THIS IS A GOOD VIDEO FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE WATCHING A GREAT BAND PERFORM GREAT SONGS.THE ONLY DRAW BACKS ARE IT'S DEPRESSING TO SEE STALEY SO FRAGILE AND SICKLY,ALSO ONE OTHER THING THE BAND WHILE THEY'RE GREAT MUSICALLY THEY ARE THE MOST NON-FUNNY AND CORNY PEOPLE ON THE PLANET(JUST SHUT UP AND PLAY)LEAVE THE COMEDY TO THE COMEDIANS.
B000006T0D|5.0|Forget the conventional wisdom that Blondie peaked with &quot;Parallel Lines&quot;. They didn't. PL may be more all shiny and commercial - it sure didn't have anything as raw and uncompromising as &quot;Victor&quot; - but for my money, &quot;Eat To The Beat&quot; is overall a more varied and satisfying piece of work. ETTB is Blondie showing off their punk roots (circa &quot;Blondie&quot; and &quot;Plastic Letters&quot;) but with the big production values of PL. From the opening drum fill of &quot;Dreaming&quot;, Blondie thrashes and rocks like mad for the whole of the first side with great tunes (&quot;Union City Blues&quot;, Shayla&quot;, etc) and hooks that sink in and don't let go. Just when you think there's more of the same coming up, Blondie does a flip over with touches of raggae and the gorgeous and the mouthwateringly silky smooth &quot;Slow Motion&quot;, followed by the #1 UK smash, &quot;Atomic&quot;, disco rock at its best and superior to the overated &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;. Blondie falters only once with &quot;Sound-a-Sleep&quot;, a meandering little lullaby which goes nowhere. The album closes with &quot;Victor&quot; with a hoarse and screaming Debbie providing shock value and yet another rocker. &quot;Eat To The Beat&quot; is a great album. It still isn't better than &quot;Blondie&quot; - the group never quite recaptured the freshness and perfection of the comic book punk style of their debut album- but it's the second Blondie album you should have in your collection.
B000051VWW|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this cd because of some negative reviews I'd seen, but I am so glad I went ahead and purchased it. This is a more mature Sade, both emotionally and musically. The music is spare, it lets her voice and emotion come through unfettered, and Sade has a lot to say. She is happy, she knows that life sends it's own problems, but she has her lover's rock, and that is enough.      Sade has gone through a lot of changes in her life, but she has found a place to rest from the storms. This is the first Sade cd I actually sat through and didn't get bored with her voice or what she has to say.      This is not a work for those used to the Mya's, Monica's or Brandy's of the world, but for those who have come through teen angst to the other side, to adulthood, and adult love and all that it brings. Love how she has matured and taken us with her.
6305014140|5.0|Well for me, I first seen it at a friends house. We rented because of the rumour of horrifying gore. I was so addicted to it (while this was some time ago!) I copied the video. Now with its release on Digital Versatile Disc, the movies clarity makes the video that much more intense. <br />I reccomend this movie to any anime fans, people just getting into anime, or anybody looking for violence in a good story unlike a porno without a good storyline.<br />The Characters are as real as you and I. Not much more to say here!<br />The Vilans (monsters, creatures, whatever) are more like a fantasy that you wish was real. You wish you were the big rock guy.... not going to spoil the movie here!<br />Overall -- -- -- --  5 * * * * * + 1 *  The Plus One is my personal Signature for an excellent Movie!
B00004X0Q0|4.0|This is a huge sounding album, very clever production, it all sounds so BIG.  There is a lot of honesty and passion in the 12 tracks on offer.  I wouldn't say it amazingly original, you can hear Rage Against The Machine, Nirvana, Girls Against Boys &amp; Therapy? influences throughout the album, but they aren't playing it by numbers you can feel the energy thoughout the album.  Lyrically it's good, the vocals take some getting used to paricully on Track 1 (arcarsenal) when the singer simply shouts.  Punk Influences appear on the album imparitically 'Pattern Against User' &amp; 'Rolodex Propaganda' the latter featuring Iggy Pop guest vocaling, but this is hard edge punk, not the bubblegum snot of Offspring &amp; Green Day.<br />One thing that annoying me is some of the song titles, some of them just seem to be plucked out off thin air, not being mentioned in the lyrics or having anything to do with the theme of the song.<br />So overall an album definatly worth checking out if you want some emotion and passion in your life.  One of the highlights of a generally poor year for music.
6300246876|5.0|I've seen this film any number of times and my prevailing thought is &quot;utterly unbelieveable&quot;! I refer to, of course, the final attack on Pearl Harbor during the last 30 minutes of the film. The oscar winning special effects are among the finest ever seen in any movie in the history of Hollywood. The Japanese sequences depicting the events leading up to the attack are well directed and acted, while the US seqences depicting an ingnorant American staff of officers &quot;I want confirmation&quot;, &quot; ...well...don't worry about it&quot;, &quot;sir, may I recommend you telephone Admiral Kimmel in Hawiai&quot;-&quot;no....I'd better phone the President first...now if you all would please exuse me&quot; and other such dialogue provides a stark contrast to the Japanese segments. All in all, this DVD is not to be missed by anyone, American, Japanese or any other nationality who has any interest at all in WWII.
0451167716|5.0|If I use any words, more poetic it could be, for discribe the wanders I capt of this mensage from The Godfather, surely I would not succede. I am sure that planty of people shere this feeling with me, if you ever read this book you must agree, but what is real important is that if you didn't you must do it urgently. Don Vito is an exemple of mathematics perfection, he is completely logical, and all of his procedures acord with his logic. It is impossible criticise all of the history, but it is too easy missunderstand many things that are writen. You can take thousands of lesons about how to behave againist many situation or negotiation in your privet life, and even when you loose your mind and explode in a discussion just to force your point, you will remind Don Vito and make your self-critic. If there is one thing I can tell you, this is: Please read this book urgently, and if you want to, send me your thoghts about it. I wish you have a happy new year...
6301735048|4.0|I had not seen a Kevin Costner movie for 11 years, but when I went back to the video store to take a look around, I found Revenge and I am surprised to say how much I liked it, and I am pleased to own it. When reading other people's reviews I have to agree that the score was beautiful, and I think it is okay that it doesn't have a happy ending because I don't think that there could have been a way to make a happy ending while remaining true to the characters.  Perhaps these are people who don't know how to be happy anyway, they are all fighting the demons of the choices they made in life.  I enjoyed the acting, both the major and secondary characters all felt alive to me.  I can only think that no one remembers this movie because several of his &quot;big&quot; movies came out near to this one like Robin Hood (which is so bad Amazon doesn't allow for enough space to explain) and Dances with Wolves.  Someone told me that Americans can't stand an unhappy ending, so maybe that has something to do with the movie's lack of success.  Some scenes were hard to watch, but I am glad that I discovered this movie, and if you want to see some very good acting and a very dark slice of life, please see this movie.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I am not what you would call a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers but I could not help buy this cd after hearing songs like &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot; and &quot;Californication&quot; so many times. The songs are melodic and catchy. Getting them out of my head is impossible. This cd is an excellent alternative to anything by Limp Bizkit and Creed.
B000005ALP|4.0|Being an avid fan of e (Mark Oliver Everett) and his eels, I deeply appreciate their debut as the starting point of a darkly optimistic sound that only the eels can create.  From the starting track of &quot;novocain for the soul&quot; to the final track &quot;manchild&quot; (my personal favorite) the boys haunt and taunt the world around them to open their eyes in a different way.  Not being able to label their sound as anything but eels, you must hear their records to understand what e has to offer the world.  It is an effective mixture of pop rock, alternative rock, indie rock...whatever you care to call it.
0061003646|5.0|It was amazing that how a body is found in a library and then how Miss Marple twists you and then when you think you know who did it you're wrong. You start to think that the characters are real and by the way Agatha Christie weaves the plot to make it different. Great suspenseful book!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem and Dr. Dre are absolutely talented. The song that sold me on accepting some rap was California love by Tupac.<br />The reason why I rate this CD at a five, even though it is a type of music (rap) I don't generally like, was because of the song Kim- it has power. Pure adrenaline, pure brutality, pure genius.<br />That song makes Eminem an artist in the true sense of the word.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have a friend, Joey, who's in a local band around here...one day, when I was giving him a ride home, he says, &quot;pop this in, it's like the best band!&quot;.  So, I pop in a rough recording of &quot;One Step Closer&quot;.  I have to admit, at first listen, I wasn't that impressed.  But, after downloading &quot;With You&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot; off of Napster, I was hooked.  That CD hasn't left my stereo for weeks now.  I love every bit of it.  The funny thing is, even my mother likes Linkin Park!  She loves Chester's vocals on songs like &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;. Anyone who doesn't relate completely to at least one of these songs is just INSANE!
B00003CX8J|5.0|The movie was fantastic!  My entire family loved it.
0679879269|5.0|I loved this book- after finishing it last night- after a straight three days of non stop reading, I put down the book and cried for an hour.  It has managed to shove away all the books I have obsessed over and praised for the past couple of years, and make itself number one.  Its exceptionally written, but even better then the writing is the story.  I don't think the series went down hill at all. Personally I think this book may have even been better then the Golden Compass.  I haven't felt as drawn and enraptured by a book as I did with this one for a very long time.  I know this is foolish, but I just think this book is the best book in the entire world.  I sound like some little 12 year old ( no offense to the little twelve year olds reading this) or some slightly insane person, but I'm not.  Just . . . buy this book.  And read it.  And love it.  Its fabulous. Don't you wish you could be IN this book? I do
0517053616|1.0|Guess what! This is a great book! JUST KIDDING! It's HORRIBLE! IT IS BY FAR THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! I would never, ever, ever, ever buy this book. NEVER! Oh, did I mention how bad the writing is? The writing is HORRIBLE! IT IS THE WORST WRITING THAT I HAVE READ IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  If you are bored enough to read this book, you have way too much free time and don't deserve to have the money that it costs to buy it.  I really don't know why everyone says that Shakespeare is such a great writer. He isn't.
0446604844|1.0|Absolute Power was a great fun thriller.  Baldacci had all the makings of a John Grisham contender.  It was a great success, so of course, the publishing company coerced another book out of him as quickly as possible; and it's obvious!<br />It is contrived and ludicrous, with feeble (and almost embarrassing) attempts at integrating computer technology a la Tom Clancy.  Furthermore, the main character is Not the wily lawyer as in his first novel (and most Grisham tales), but the inept wife who must travel all over the lands to save her kidnapped husband.  Most of the writing seems painfully forced, and it was all I could do to finish the dreadful monotony, in hopes that it could get better.<br />Needless to say, I haven't read subsequent novels, which, I realise, may have been written better, considering, perhaps, more lenient deadlines.  But I won't do it.  Not again.<br />Yes, I am disenchanted with Mr. Baldacci's writing.  But don't take my word for it.  Afterall, you need something to read in the airport.  On second thought, you're better off waiting and reading the onflight magazine.  In the infamous words of Charlie Brown, &quot;Arrrrrgggh!&quot;
6300214028|2.0|&quot;Reds&quot; is a movie that once was practically the national anthem of the Liberal-Left America of the 70's and the 80's. It was what the groovy people wanted to hear and see - not the realities of an ideology that far surpassed the atrocities of the Nazis, but the Hollywood version heavy on feel good, look good, be sexy, be cool - hey, those Communists were such good guys, how is it possible for everyone NOT to love them. Robert Redford and Jane Fonda would have been better on the screen, but they had to settle for the second team. As a great Hollywood entertainment blockbuster that served to prolong the Communist mythology for another decade, &quot;Reds&quot; ranks with &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; and &quot;The Way We Were&quot;. John Reeds or Jane Fondas, (Redford and Keaton were hardly political) - were all dupes, tools of the International Communist Movement, always directed from Moscow. Had John Reed known just how useless and unworkable the Communist ideology really was, he would have been red-faced not just red. The film's redeeming value lies in the fact that it immortalizes Jerzy Kosinski on the Hollywood screen, much to the displeasure of America's &quot;reds&quot; - past or present. &quot;Reds&quot; is an entertainment extravaganza par excellence, political thriller it is not!
0140177396|5.0|i just read this book for my english class, im only 14 right now... i'm usually bored by a lot of books but this book actually got my liking... very awesome book. Steinbeck is a genius.
6305066345|4.0|He got game is a splendid movie! Most basketball movies out there are just an excuse to have footage of people throwing a basketball. He got game is more than that, Spike manages to intricately weave personal dilema of Jesus and his family into the movie. The movie is a touching dipiction of a young man who is forced to grow-up before his time because of his socio-economic position and a young man who stands to be exploited because of his natural talents.The only qualm I have is that the ending is rather suspect otherwise, a great movie.
0694006300|5.0|This is one of the best audio version of a story that we have come across. My 2 daughters, ages 2 and 4, love to listen to it in the car. Carol Kane has such a wonderful, fun voice. The tape not only reads the book, but also has a couple of little activities and a cute dancing song. First Carol Kane reads the story. Next she reads it again, playing a couple of games with the kids. In one version she leaves out words for the kids to fill in. (What kid does not know the book by heart?) Then she reads it again, changing some of the words to create an even sillier version of the story. Finally she sings a cute little song that the kids love to dance to. We listen to this in the car. The kids love it even if the book is not handy. I highly reccomend the audio version of this book. Pick it up, you won't be sorry.
0385495323|5.0|Mr. Singh's outstanding book is the one that started it all for me in cryptology. I had read a review of the book in Forbes, I believe, and saw the book in a bookstore, so I decided to get it. I was hooked! I didn't understand the all the math, and I kind of skimmed thru some of the cryptanalysis, but since then, I have purchased virtually every obtainable book in his bibliography, and I am a long way toward understanding more of the math. This book is a much easier read than Kahn's &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;, but if you're like me, you'll want to read that one too! And then, you'll search out other crypto resources like the American Cryptogram Association, with it's excellent Classic Crypto Book Service (yep, I bought quite a few of those too!). OK, maybe not everyone will fall for such a nerdy hobby, but Singh's book is still a great read, and who knows. . .you may get hooked as well! PS. . .make sure you check Mr. Singh's web page if you intend to try and solve the challenges in the back, as he points out some typos that could save you lots of frustration.
0553106635|5.0|Martin has accomplished something truly amazing with this work. In some sense (and to only a certain degree), he has finally moved the fantasy genre, which is by its very nature behind on the times, into the 20th century. At the end of about 800 pages, it appears we've stepped into fatal tragedy on the order of _Hamlet_; it seems probable that NO ONE is going to survive this work. He backs off from this vision with a couple of windfalls and resurrections, but still, the amount of well-developed bloodshed is sufficient to delight readers like myself who found the execution of Ned Stark to be a wonderful thing in principle. His focus on Jaime Lannister is improbable, impeccable, and perfectly representative of his work: in other fantasy series, readers must content themselves with one or two characters steeped in shades of gray, but here Jaime simply joins the long list of meaty, breathing, utterly delicious men and women conceived by this extraordinary series. And, delightfully, this is no perfect ending to this series, merely a stop along the ascent of the Eyrie. Gods bless, Maester Martin: take your well-deserved break and then, I implore you, give us more.
B000001GQH|3.0|I bought this CD thinking, &quot;Hey, it's the Berlin Phil, it's got to be amazing.&quot;  Well, it wasn't.  If you're looking for &quot;La Mer&quot; or &quot;Bolero&quot;, BUY this CD.  They are magnificent and hypnotic, demonstrating what the orchestra and its conductor are really capable of.  That is why this CD gets 4 stars.<br />If, on the other hand, you are looking for  &quot;Pictures&quot;, look elsewhere.  The Chicago Symphony under Reiner is the best recording I have found.  Next to that, this version just doesn't compare.  First of all, the opening Promenade has an uneven sound quality.  It almost sounds like the trumpets are switching off on the solo.  Not only that, but the trumpet seems to have an unusual buzz in his sound.  It's really not pleasant to listen to.  This is compounded by Karajan's slow tempos - the opening &quot;Promenade&quot; isn't too bad, but the others just drag.  &quot;Gnomus&quot; is played brilliantly in places, but it lacks the twisting, wicked sound of the violins found in the CSO under Reiner.  &quot;The Old Castle&quot;, however, is one of the CD's strongest tracks.  In &quot;Samuel Goldenberg&quot;, I was once again displeased with the trumpet.  He needs to get control of his tonguing and let some sound out.  I know the solo is high and difficult and staccato - I play trumpet myself - but it just sounds ugly.  The notes are spit out with little attention to quality and a few bobbles.  &quot;Limoges&quot;, &quot;Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks&quot;, and &quot;Tuileries&quot; all lacked the playfulness found with the CSO, while &quot;Baba Yaga&quot; just was not vicious enough for my tastes.  &quot;The Great Gate&quot; some of you may really enjoy.  It is more calm and less brassy than the CSO version.  However, the trumpet is yet again a problem.  Either he's shaking and having trouble controlling the notes, or he's putting way too much vibrato in where it's not needed or wanted.  <br />Most of the problems I have with this &quot;Pictures&quot; are interpretational - the BPO does overall play quite well.  Some of you will disagree with my notion of how the suite should sound and for you, this might be an excellent recording.  I, however, don't like this version very much.  I enjoy much more the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Reiner, and also Ashkenazy's piano and orchestral versions.
B00003CXDG|4.0|One must keep in mind that the point of this action adventure movie is not to break new ground in a dramatic sense, but to entertain, and that it does.  The story is nothing new, save the girl, kill the bad guy, and let the world drift on unknowing of the peril it was in.  The key is the special effects, explosions, and fight scenes which are excelently done.  Inparticular, this Mission Impossible has wonderfully choreographed fight sequences which the first Mission Impossible lacked.  The musing in excellent and so is the editing.  Everything flows.<br />There are problems though.  We don't know how or why our villian turned evil, the whole deadly virus thing has been done, and our hero never misses a single shot.  If you're just an action adventure fan not into looking for holes, you'll enjory this movie.
0525945636|3.0|After all of the obvious research that the author did on rocket science, he blows it on American culture.  Protagonist Luke wakes up in 1958 and steals a Ford Fiesta, a model not introduced in the United States until 1977.  Neat trick, Luke. Maybe it was &quot;really&quot; a Ford Fairlane.  Oh well, Shakespeare put chimneys in ancient Rome. <br />As usual, Follet has crafted a pleasantly engaging read, but it does not hold a candle to Pillars of the Earth, Dangerous Fortune, et al.
B000002UWF|5.0|This collection is fantastic! I defy any one to listen to familiar songs like &quot;Jump, Jive, and Wail&quot; or &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; and not want to dance around your living room. It speaks to Louis' skill and artistry to note that the more familiar covers of these tunes kept most of his scat and intonation to their vocals. He did it best and it would be hard to improve.<br />Some of my favorite songs from this CD, like &quot;Angelina&quot; and &quot;Beuna Sera&quot;, have a distinctly &quot;Italian&quot; lyric. Under this, however, is a distinctly New Orleans swing groove. The combination elevates what could be cheesy lounge music to a unique and innovative jazz sound that is surprisingly fresh even today.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Yes, I honestly did rate the debut one star, which I still believe it deserved.  What makes this album that much better??  The vocals are actually worse on this album ... I'd take the breathy gasps and hiccups from the debut over the chipmunk nasal sound in &quot;Oops! ... I Did It Again&quot;, but overall the content is so much better.  I'll admit it ... most of these songs are enjoyable whereas I could only stand two songs from the debut.  I'd say Britney will recorded two more albums before her fame is up while Christina Aguilera, who is ridiculously talented, will be remembered forever.<br /><br />1. OOPS! ... I DID IT AGAIN: Fine, so I couldn't get enough of this song when I first heard it! ... but it gets WAY old way too fast. (7/10)<br /><br />2. STRONGER: I really like this song, but I like it more now after seeing the video.  It actually doesn't have a great message to it, but it sounds really cool ... and overproduced. (9/10) <br /><br />3. DON'T GO KNOCKING ON MY DOOR: This is the #1 song!  My favorite moment of this song is at the very end of the first verse.  Although some deluded fans were like &quot;OMG, like, Britney is so R&amp;B&quot;, the song is still 98% pop. (10/10)<br /><br />(I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION: I've never heard the original, so I can't compare the two versions.  I applaud the Rolling Stones' openess to other genres of music, which I couldn't say about any modern-day rockers save a handful.  This version sounds good, and that's all that matters. (9/10)<br /><br />DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW: Don't let her let the backup singers sing.  The vocals are horrible, but we can credit that to the backup singers ... can you say &quot;whiny&quot;?  With her ballads, Britney should try to go beyond singing about boys. (5/10) <br /><br />WHAT U SEE (IS WHAT U GET): This song has a good AND bad message.  The good part says &quot;Don't judge people by their looks&quot; and the other part says to the world of young girls, &quot;You can wear anything you want ... maybe pole dance in front of thousands of people every night.&quot;  Despite this, it sounds good. (9.5/10) <br /><br />LUCKY: Hmmm ... this song could have gone places with someone else singing the vocals ... too bad it had to fall into the hands of Britney.  That VOICE!  It's probably the worst I've ever heard ... if you up the volume, you'll wish you never had eardrums. (4/10) <br /><br />ONE KISS FROM YOU: Could Britney BE any more cliched?  Not for those who are lactose intolerant. (5/10) <br /><br />WHERE ARE YOU NOW: I was wrong ... THIS is the cheesiest song on the album.  Listen to the lyrics and you'll say, &quot;Is this actually coming from the mouth of a multiplatinum selling superstar???  She wouldn't dare!&quot;  But believe it.  The vocals are nothing that the average American girl couldn't top. (1/10) <br /><br />CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME: This is what Britney is good for - heavily produced, fun dance pop.  I love this song except for &quot;I'm just a girl with a crush on you.&quot;  I thought this album was supposed to be more mature than the first! (9/10) <br /><br />WHEN YOUR EYES SAY IT: My eyes are saying &quot;I can't believe it!!!&quot;  I like a ballad by Britney Spears!  Actually, I can't say it's a ballad ... it's not heart-felt enough ... it's a slow-song.  It's a pleasant surprise and the second best on the album! (10/10) <br /><br />DEAR DIARY: In English class one day my teacher was talking about rockstars who must have been drunk by the time they recorded the last track ... &quot;Oops! ... I Did It Again&quot; was brought up (not by me), and I must confess I still agree.  I'll give Britney two bonus points for writing the song herself. (2/10)
B000050IMG|4.0|Scary Movie. What a name huh? Because, unless you are a total whimp, there was nothing scary about this movie. It was however, an outragesly funny movie for the young (12+) at heart. The scenes portray such as Scream (1,2,3), I know..., Blair Witch, and many more. The actors and actresses are also made fun of in this entertaining flick. <br />Now, this is a movie for teens and adults younger than 40. Some &quot;adults&quot; won't enjoy this. But I know my mother of 39, liked this movie and certainly did get a good laugh out of it! So, if you are in the mood for a &quot;teeny&quot; style flick, you'll like it. Even more so, if you have seen all the &quot;Scary Movies&quot; that they poke fun at. <br />One warning however, this movie is not for those people who think things should be &quot;proper, and respectible&quot; but for those who absolutely love stupid (George of the Jungle) or wacky sexual pics, you should enjoy it.<br />Not the best review, I know. But hey, It gets the point accross. I liked it, I'm 19 and I think normal people who aren't real bent up about sexuality and stuff, should see it. <br />Blessings~~~
0195067142|5.0|With the Old Breed is the best memoir I have read on the Second World War.  After a brief chapter about his introduction into the Marine Corps, Sledge brings us with him into the fetid, humid hell that was the Pacific theater. Sledge, a mortarman with 3/5, 1st Marine Division, graphically details his experiences at Peleliu (a pointless battle) and Okinawa.<br />His tales are moving and brutal. In one account, his vivid description of digging a fighting hole only to find the rotting corpse of a Japanese soldier 2 feet down literally made my skin crawl. Elsewhere he recounts the bitter personal brutality that was all too common between US Marines and Japanese soldiers. After reading this book, you will understand what Sledge meant when, in the introduction he writes, &quot;it has been a burden to retain this story.&quot; We should be thankful that Sledge decided to share his burden with posterity, lest we forget the awful price paid by all who were involved.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Two men, each a consummate professional in his respective field-- but on opposite sides of the law-- become adversaries in a high-stakes cat and mouse game from which only one can emerge victorious, in the action/drama \\"Heat,\\" directed by Michael Mann and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.  Neil McCauley (De Niro) is a professional criminal who makes his living by \\"Taking down scores;\\" it's all he knows, and what he does best.  Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a Detective with the L.A.P.D. whose main reason for \\"being\\" is to stop guys like McCauley from doing what they do best.  It's what \\"he\\" does best.  And when circumstances put them together on the same playing field, it becomes a battle of wits and tenacity, a matter of who will outwit whom and when; for each man is adamant in intent, and it becomes clear early on that neither will ever acquiesce, withdraw or concede the game to his opponent.  McCauley lives by a code that allows him to walk away if he knows the heat is around the corner, but only to another space on the same board; and Hanna owns the board.  What follows is an intense study in the dynamics of uncompromising conviction; and the tension begins with the opening sequence and continues to build throughout the film, right up to the very end.  In McCauley, De Niro has created a character that is more than just a bit disconcerting; a hardened criminal, ready to kill-- indiscriminately-- at the drop of a hat, anyone who gets in his way, but with an outward appearance that belies his true nature.  This guy is anybody's next door neighbor; the software salesman or the manager of the local A&amp;P who would blend in with the crowd anywhere because he is so nondescript.  A man whose life is a ruse, hiding his psychotic, sociopathic instincts behind a facade of normalcy.  And De Niro plays him with such integrity that it makes him one of the more terrifying characters he's ever brought to the screen, not because of what he seems to be, but because of what youknow he is capable of.  His portrayal of Max Cady in \\"Cape Fear\\" was, by comparison, the outward expression of what McCauley is underneath, and which he conceals so well; With Cady at least you could discern the evil of the man just by looking at him-- a man the likes of which you would cross the street to avoid if you saw him coming.  McCauley is the one you would invite in, never suspecting the truth.  And that is what makes him such a powerful character.  Pacino's Hanna, on the other hand, is the exact opposite.  He's boisterous, loud, and in all ways larger than life; he swaggers and intimidates.  And why?  Because it gets results. The manner he affects gives him the presence he needs to ferret out the criminal element and to keep them in line; if someone chooses to play in his court, they're going to know he's there, and he's not going to let them forget it.  It's his turf, his rules, end of story.  It's a purposefully over-the-top performance, because that's who Hanna is, or at least that's the face he puts on for the job.  Underneath he's just a man looking for a little peace in his life, a part of his own personal puzzle that has so far eluded him, in no small part due to the dedication he brings to his work.  The necessity of dealing with reality at the level he must day in and day out is simply not conducive with the ability to leave the job at the door when the shift is over.  For a man like Hanna, the shift is never over.  And the fact that McCauley-- at the other end of the spectrum-- is made of the same cloth, is what gives this film such explosive intensity.  The exemplary supporting cast includes Val Kilmer (Chris), Jon Voight (Nate), Tom Sizemore (Michael), Diane Venora (Justine Hanna), Amy Brenneman (Eady), Ashley Judd (Charlene), Natalie Portman (Lauren), Hank Azaria (Alan) and Kevin Gage (Waingro).  \\"Heat\\" is a hard-hitting, memorable film, impeccably directed and delivered by Mann; an entertaining and action-packed character study with an adrenaline rush that never lets you off the hook for a moment.  And how great to see De Niro and Pacino together; that alone is worth the price of admission.  If you're ready for some excitement, check this one out; it'll take you to the edge and keep you there, and by the time it's over you'll be ready for more of the same-- and that is what movies are all about.  That is the magic.
6301969294|2.0|I have been accused of being a collectivist because I do not enjoy Ayn Rand's novels.  I'd always tried to argue that it wasn't the message that I disagreed with, but the delivery.  In fact, I whole heartedly believe that man's individuality is his greatest strength, that true virtue can only be reached when man stands alone, and that a person should not have to compromise his or her vision to serve society.  I also don't suffer under the delusion that this is an amazing revelation and that I am one of the few people in the world that understands this.  <br />Unfortunately, her writing and the film adaptation of her book &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; makes it clear that she did believe this. The way people talk is ridiculous.  Nearly everything that came out of the mouths of the &quot;bad guys&quot; was something like: &quot;What hope can one man have to stand against the will of the majority?  In an age such as ours we can not afford to have individuals who dare hold their own vision.&quot;  The dialogue is really that silly. <br />Rand called her style of writing Romantic Realism.  Romantic because it dealt with people not as they are, but as they should be.  Realism because her stories were set in the real world.  Since the good guys (like the supreme egoist and hero of the film Howard Roark) embody her Romantic ideal, I am only left to believe that she put the bad guys (the conformists and collectivists) into the realism column.  That is absurd.  I'm sorry Ms. Rand, but people don't talk like that, and very very few people think like that.<br />That is the main flaw of this film and Ayn Rand's fiction in general -- it is not set in the real world.  Her message would have been countless times more effective had it strived to show the more subtle ways that people are made to conform and compromise.  Instead of this, however, we get a steady stream of things like &quot;the vision of one man is unimportant compared to the will of the people.&quot;  <br />In some waysI can understand Rand's paranoia.  She fled Russia when the communists took over and came to America, the only country that was founded on similar ideals as she held.  I'm sure that in Russia around the time of the revolution there was more talk of the kind found in this movie (though I can't help but think the dialogue would've made even Lenin groan).  Even so, the societal picture she paints doesn't really apply to American audiences.  The message -- yes, the delivery -- no.<br />There is no subtlety to the plot or the dialogue, there is no depth to the characters or the performances, and to be honest most of the movie is so hokey that it will keep you rolling on the floor. <br />Howard Roark himself said that form must follow function.   Indeed it should, and Ayn Rand would probably do well to follow her own advice.
B00004XOWN|5.0|Limp Bizkit, has hit the screens again! With Rollin`, Take look around, My Generation, Hot Dog and more.  Limp Bizkit, is so good I would die to meet him. Because he`s so good and that`s just that. You can`t change it never. And I mean it.  I think Limb Bizkit should be the president. Don`t you?
0684853523|4.0|It is ironic that this is the first book I have read by Stephen King. I do not know why I decided to start here, but I am glad I did.  King first presents the reader with a brief account of his journey through ecoming a writer.  His witty sense of humor about his own beginnings is enjoyable.  He emphasizes that even the best of writers have gotten rejection letters, including himself.  This first part lets you take a glimpse into what made King the writer he is today(which is very interesting!).  King then concludes with a section on writing.  He does not give a magical formula for becoming a writer, but instead gives basic advice.  Read and write alot is what I got from it (very basic).  Overall, I really enjoyed reading this first piece of writing I have read by King, and by the way...I have already bought The Shining for my next read!

B00003CWTI|1.0|The entire movie is anti-climactic.  You could watch it backwards and it wouldn't have made a difference.<br />Being that this was a three-hour movie, I had high expectations of Magnolia.  A movie this long was bound to have in-depth, intelligent dialog that analyzed the events of everyday life.  For the first two and a half hours I watched it as objectively as possible, but in the back of my mind I was hoping that all this character/plot development would eventually lead up to a climax that was worth three hours of anyone's life.<br />I was disappointed, however.  The prologue for the movie and theatrical trailers that I have seen did not do justice to the irrelevant, uninteresting rhetoric of the movie.  It does not &quot;all come together&quot; in the end.  There is no epiphanous moment in which the movie makes a point, changes your perspective, or convinces you that this particular DVD was worth twenty-five dollars.<br />The songs by Aimee Mann were the only high points.<br />For those of you who loved this movie, this is only my opinion.  I can see how a movie like this could be so highly praised, but it just didn't do it for me.
630514415X|5.0|this movie was tight.  The ending was a little weak, but the plot shows what it takes, and what some people have to overcome to get anywhere in life.  This movie isn't a waste of anyone's time unless you ain't a basketball fan.
0061002747|5.0|This book is great. the begining was awesome then the middle kinda dragged cuz it was just information after information. but then the ending is unbelievable. this book should be bought by becasue you will want to read it more than once to sum up the clues.   great book.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|The album is without spirit or emotion and Lopez definitely has no vocal talent. Yes, Jennifer, you played Selena and proved you could dance in that film as well as she could, but you definitely have nothing on the late Quintanilla-Perez when it comes to music. 'On the 6' is awful. Waste of money!

B0000024K1|5.0|When you think of rap music on a whole, this album was the first to hit non rap critics. This was the fourth best album in the 80's according to Rolling Stone.  The difference between hip hop today to this album is you can listen 12 years later and not be tired of it. From the classic opening, to Black Steel this is a classic.
B00000JPH4|5.0|The wicked and desicated Skeksis, pugnacious and cantankerous reptilian creatures, refuse to die and continue to cling tenaciously to life by deriving power from a mystical dark crystal that remains suspended over a shaft of fire.  But the crystal is cracked, and the energy it offers the skeksis seems to make them more twisted.  Though ruling their world, which seems lush and dying at the same time, the Skeksis remain in the dread of two things - the noble mystics and the human-like Gelflings.  Divining their doom at the hands of the Gelflings, the Skeksis cruelly exterminate them.  But the mystics, who seem to resemble navaho medicine men as benevolent turtles, offer a more complex threat to the skeksis.  Saved from the Skeksis oppression, a young Gelfling is told of the prophecy and sets forth for the evile Skeksis' ruined castle to bring their evil reign to an end and return his world to peace.<br />It's a pretty simple story, but Jim Henson's artistry makes it all inviting, with charachters that seem ready to prove that they're no muppets.  The fantasy world seems to have no end of menace and beauty.  But its the Skeksis who steal the show - they salivate, whimper, tremble, glare and shout like magnificent feral monsters, yet plot and scheme like villains.  I doubt the film has gotten its due, but that's probably for the best - no sequel would have measured.
630575067X|2.0|Perhaps this is the best way to begin. Movies like &quot;The Lion In the Winter,&quot; Mel Gibson's &quot;Hamlet,&quot; and Neeson's &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; are stories that require little IF ANY effects. (The stories are powerful enough to carry their own weight.) This movie is quite the opposite. Effects are everywhere. BUT WHERE IS THE STORY??? I understand that it can be difficult to go backwards from the previous movies and provide earlier information, but this can push even an understanding man's patience.  For the most part, the pace is sluggish and even annoying at times. Darth Maul (the main villain) speaks twice in the whole movie. There is too much hindsight involving Anakin. (I understand that there should be some indications of his eventual fate, but it should have been more subtle and ambiguous.) Liam Neeson carries over 90 % of this movie. He is the only person who saves this from being a complete disaster. (He seems to be the only one in the cast who realizes the importance of acting and character development.) Senator Palpatine and Obi Wan share the other 10 %. I will say the fight between Qui Jon, Obi Wan, and Darth Maul is well done. (But a few moments of quality can not carry a whole movie.) I can not say I am holding my breath for part 2.
0679879269|5.0|i've not read the previous two books, but i'm very impressed with how well this stands by itself. i've little patience with modern &quot;fantasy&quot; writings, but this book is so well paced, filled with flawed characters making difficult moral decisions (with often terrifying consequences), and so beautifully poetic that i tore through it in a day, but will be re-reading it to enjoy pullman's mastery.<br />this is a wonderfully dark and complex work: death is messy and prolonged, sadness pervades the beauty, and his land of the dead passages may have made dante shudder. also he has the audacity to write a little over a page about the death of god, a pathetic, frail whisp in a crystal box. <br />through all of it there's a warmth of familiarity. these worlds are not ours, but they feel... right. discordant battle scenes, pastoral beauty, even the sweetly ambigious scences between will and lyra all work because they feel real. <br />pullman's integrity and respect for the emotional and intellectual depth of his readers is at the core of this ultimately life affirming work about responsibility to ourselves and those around us.<br />my only complaint, a small one, is the tendancy to have characters explain things to each other. granted there were many threads needing to be tied up, but it was a little TOO neatly done, and possibly could have been done without all the exposition.  but that's a minor personal complaint- i like loose ends.
B000002U82|5.0|They say that every few years a great album is made, first we had sgt pepper which changed music from then on. Then came this album which changed it again with all the special effects and great lyrics. A Great gig in the sky stands out as a classic with such haunting vocals. The album tracks just blend together with classics like Time and Money and the greatest finish to an album of Eclipse and Brain Damage. This album is a must for any music lover. And the album that made loads of people check out other great floyd albums such as Meddle and Relics.
B000002WYT|5.0|I stole this CD permanently from my Mum, after hearing it, and I think any other DMB fan would totally agree!<br />This is truely an amazing CD. As I said in my title, it has this unbeleivable fusion of folk, jazz, rock, and Dave Matthews vocals just make this CD a killing. It all fits perfectly into place, without being too much, or not enough. The percussion and drumming, guitaring, and all other aspects for example brass, are simply amazing. <br />How are the lyrics so beautiful? The tracks 'Crash Into Me', 'Say Goodbye' (excellent music here) and 'Let you Down' just work their way into your soul, with these amazing cool vocals with melodies that just leave you in this state of awe, thought, love....damn these are some of the most beautiful tracks ever produced!<br />Lets not forget though that DMB can also totally rock it, and let all loose. 'Tripping Billies'...an excellent rocking jazz fusion, 'Lie in Our Graves'...Sounds like an unreal rocking Jam, and 'Two Step'...this excellent folky track with chockas of rock. <br />I love this album to a point where I don't really know what to say. There is NOT a bad song on this album, and no joke, I think it comes to a point where it doesn't really matter what style of music that you're int, you can find something in this album that will totally get you going. <br />'Music is the glue of the world' (Eddie, 'Empire Records'). And this CD, DMB's 'Crash', is the sticky part, it holds us all together!
B00003CXDF|5.0|I found this movie very exciting! The wonderful talents of Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, and Thandie Newton astounded me! With experience talking I highly recomend Mission Impossible 2. I believe it is the best sequel I've seen so far! Tons better than the very good yet very difficult to understand Mission Impossible. Also I would like to compliment the actors who played Luther and Billy and all of Sean's (Dougray Scott's) sidekicks.      Though there was momentary violence the movie not all based on blood and gore. (That I appriecieted.) I enjoyed this plot much better than M:I1. It wasn't layed out on the table right from the beginning nor was it Mission: Impossible just to discover what was happening. I like to call it, mind candy.    I also appreciated the love intrest which made (in my opinion) the plot and the actors and actress more intense and emotional. Every time I watch it I sigh because even though it's action packed for the guys out there, it's also mysteriously sweet for the ladies. If you are still reading this, I strongly suggest you should rent M:I2 to check out Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott at there best. Enjoy!!
6304609825|5.0|this movie has to be my all tiem favorite disney movie....even though i m 15 n its not cool to love cartoon, this is one damn good exception! ive loved this movie since i was 4!
B00000K19E|5.0|I went to see this film knowing nothing about it, thinking it was just a high-tech keanu reeves flick. o, my, god! I was totally blown away from the opening scene. this film is unlike anything I have ever seen before. the effects totally blasted star wars into well-deserved oblivion at the oscars, and Larwrence Fishbourne gave a terrific acting performance. the only downside on the dvd is that in some spots the picture is not that great of quality, especially when they are in the sewers hiding from the robots. other than that, the sound is the best you will hope to find on dolby digital, very good. if you can find the DTS version, pick up that one instead, it's slighty better. I can hardly wait until 2002 when the sequel comes out. for now though, I'll just be watching this film over and over again.
B000000WF0|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best albums of the 90's. It contains two megahits - Bitter Sweet Symphony and The Drugs Don't Work. The latter I consider to be one of the best love songs ever recorded. Few other songs also rate very high - Sonet, Lucky Man, Space and Time and Velvet Morning. <br />The album is very consistent with an excellent sound, brilliant lead vocal by Richard Ashcroft and gentle and often psychedelic guitar by Nick McCabe. Ashcroft, an author of most of the songs, is at its peak as a songwriter. His songs at Urban Hymns are better than on the two previous Verve albums. He can write the most passionate and tender lyrics and then deliver them in his original way.<br />The Verve only recorded three albums, each of them better than the previous one. Urban Hymns is the last one after which the band broke up. If you like Urban Hymns then I recommend to go back and listen to the previous one called A Northern Soul (the song History itself is worth the money). Ashcroft's solo album from 2000 - Alone With Everybody is a good work too.
0792844890|5.0|Mel Brook's hit comedy gold with this film, released in the 80s and spoofing star wars. The cast is terrific,and the special effects are actually quite darn good too. I just bought this DVD, and the best part of the film is mel brooks directors commentary! this is the best commentary on any dvd I own. mel brooks jokes around, is good-humored, and there is not too many pauses in the commentary either. If you arent a fan of commentary, I promise that you find this one at least fun to watch once. Everyone reading this has probably already seen the film, so let me tell all of you the sound on this disc is fantastic, especially for a relativily old master tape. the picture gives you 2 sides-one for pan/scan, the other for widescreen. if you loved the film, you will love this DVD! Movie:5 stars Disc: 5 stars. enjoy!
0553577123|5.0|I am a 13 year old girl who had to read this book as an assignment for school in 7th grade.  I thought that is was a sad yet very interesting book written by a girl who was affraid and scared , who had no idea what was going to happen to her.  I was touched, but that is not even the word to describe I felt about this book in general. The way she deals with life and how she approaches life itself is so interesting and amaziing.  After reading the book, I began to relise that she wanted to do so much with her life, but was only days within reaching it or trying to start beginning it.  It was destrubing how people could treat people that way with no compassion at all.  And all because they were Jewish.  I learned so much from this book: on how life in that time and place went and that not just people being persicuted were scared but the people around them and the ones who weren't even in the country could feel their pain.  I would recomend this book to young readers who want to learn and who enjoy diaries in general.  I recomend this book to all people no matter how old they are.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|I am a 20 year old male with a sick and demented sense of humor, and I found this movie(obviously) to be very funny. a spoof of &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I know...&quot;, and many others, scary movie is a good movie to laugh at. while not a film I would want to buy and watch 80 times, it was a good laugh. In all seriousness: DO NOT let children watch this movie! It will warp their fragile little minds. in my humble opinion, at least rent the film. it is good for some laughs.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|OK, my player also showed the FBI warning thing... so, what you do is when you first put the DVD is press 'stop' so the FBI warning doesn't show up and your stop menu does... then push 'play' and voila! oh, my review... VERY funny! a must-see!
B00004XPP0|4.0|I promise I won't bore any of you with how great star wars is, because you probably already know too! All I will say about the movies themselves is that they are 3 of the best films of all time, original and clever. My beef with the new release is how George Lucas is selling another version of the same films over and over again. The Special Edition series was great, and like many fans, enjoyed it a lot. But form what I heard is that this new release is the special edition with a featurette on Ep. II. This a pretty cool, but you can get all of that of the starwars web site for free. They even have great streaming videos. Obviously, if you have a degraded old version or don't own this series at all, please buy this! But if you are like me, and already own the Special Edition, please check out the website for a lot of cool stuff on the film without having to pay 35 bucks to see new ep. 2 scenes.
B000051VWW|5.0|Top to bottom this CD had me hooked the first time I listened to it. While I admit I have only been an average Sade fan over the years my musical tastes have matured and I appreciate her music more now than ever. This CD has made it into my regular rotation and seems to be getting more play that the rest of my CD's. It is hard to pick a best song on this CD as all of them are so damn good!! It doesn't matter if you are just mellowing out at home, driving in the car or romancing your significant other this CD is great in all situations.
B000001IPL|5.0|this cd is one of the greatest cd's of the 90s.  oh yes, i can remember the hundreds of times i listened to this cd... brings back great memories... i recommend it HIGHLY! this is a MUST BUY!
B00003CXE7|4.0|This is too good of a movie with such great effects to watch on one-half of the TV screen. What's up with this widescreen format being stuffed down the viewers throat.  Take it or leave is not good enough for me.  DVD formatting is a great audio and video advancement, let's have the ability to view it on the full formatted screen.
B000002UAO|5.0|This album is a *true* classic - it stands the test of time.  Every song on the album jumps out at you and you'll be hummin' the tunes in your head for weeks!  This record is far ahead of its time - John Lennon and Paul McCartney are simply golden.  &quot;Drive My Car&quot; is a great opening track - a very fun song!  &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot; is a beautiful, acoustic guitar driven song - Lennon sounds spectacular on this song.  &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; is a brilliant song - Lennon's vocals stand out prominently.  &quot;In My Life&quot; is one of my all-time favorite Beatles songs - a beautiful ballade of reflection and memories.  The songs listed by no means are the &quot;only&quot; or &quot;best&quot; songs on the record - every song is brilliant!  This is a *MUST HAVE* for any music fan.
B000002H2H|5.0|I would hate to say you should buy an album for just one song (don't worry this one has plenty great ones) but you should for one song, For Whom the Bell Tolls.  I couldn't believe the first part was done on a base guitar but it was.  Any metal fan knows this album is a must have and it puts to shame modern metal like Limp Bizkit.  This album has lyrics that actually mean something and the band doesn't rely on cussing and cheesy rhymes to make their point, especially on The Call of Ktulu which is an insturmental.  Fade to Black is the other great song (which I couldn't play if my life depended on it) and a metal classic.  If you are looking for metal and you aren't sure where to start, start with this album (then buy Master of Puppets)
0380725398|4.0|Set sometime in early nineteenth century Cornwall, this is a novel about Mary Yellan, a young woman who is left alone in the world when her mother dies. She must go and live with her mother's sister, Aunt Patience and her dark and dangerous husband, Joss Merlyn. They keep the Jamaica Inn on a lonely forbidding spot on the Moors - but no casual passer-by's stop there, nor any coaches. Mary soon learns there is something grim going on. Her uncle is involved in some violent and illicit trade, and there is a sinister person who is directing her uncle's secret business. It would be difficult for Mary to leave, but she won't leave without her Aunt Patience. Despite the violence from Joss, Aunt Patience has turned into a scared, fluttering,  fey creature who seems unable to leave.  Then there Jem Merlyn, her uncle's much younger brother and for whom Mary begins to feel a conflict of emotion. Can she trust Jem? He is her hated uncle's brother after all. Yet despite this and him being a horse-thief and a care-for-nothing she finds herself falling in love with him.<br />I really enjoyed this book - the first du Maurier I had read, and it has certainly made me keen to read more.
B00004Z400|4.0|This album is not at all a dissapointment, but it definitely isn't as good as the Deftones second release Around The Fir.  But then again how could it be, I still haven't heard anything that amazing all the way through.  Here are some small thoughts and ratings I had on each track.<br />back to school- third most aggressive on CD, very appropriate single release, gets me real pumped up. 10/10<br />feiticeira- could listen to this all day, love the guitar riffs, my personal favorite track. 10/10 <br />digital bath- a little slow but has amazing chorus, Chino Moreno is really amazing here, once again proving he can sing or scream. 9/10<br />elite- heaviest track, Chino screams bloody murder through out, liked the song but not the message in the lyrics. 8/10<br />rx queen- this song sounded too mixed for me, too many different beats and percussions, but still alright, strange lyrics. 7/10<br />steet carp- more great riffs, just a great heavy song, shortest on album.  9.5/10<br />teenager- slow and light, not exactly the deftones strongest points, good, relatable lyrics about high school love, though. 4/10 <br />knife prty- very different from anything else on the album, features interesting screaming female vocals in the background. 8/10<br />korea- 2nd heaviest track, really gets tthe blood flowing, great transition in middle. 9/10 <br />passenger- this song features the amazing vocals of Maynard James Keenan (tool, A Perfect Circle), him and Chino going back and forth sounds awesome, my second favorite track. 10/10<br />change- good, but a little too slow, should not have released this as a single. 7/10  <br />pink maggit-  not a good closer, my least favorite song, takes way too long to get going, when it does, it's good but almost EXACTLY the same thing as back to school, then it slows down for a long time at the end. 3/10<br />If you've just started listening to the Deftones, do yourself a favor and get around the fir as well as this, trust me you'll thank me whenyou hear it.  And if your a long time Deftones fan, I'm sure you already have this and probably agree that it's good but not their best.
0783231482|4.0|This is a great movie not as great as &quot;Animal House&quot; but it is definitley a classic. Mission from God.
086140324X|5.0|Well, Terry Pratchett couldn't have started a series better than with his first novel &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;. The atmosphere of the story is so convincingly explained through the first couple of pages. The stories of the Discworld are set in a dome shaped world on the back of a giant turtle (Great A Tuin), it is here where all the action of the story takes place. Follow Rincewind and Twoflower as they journey through thick and thin, trying to make use of themselves but ending up in all sorts of bizarre difficulties. Terry Pratchett must be the first fantasy writer EVER to create such an amusing story whilst also keeping the idea of &quot;another world&quot;.
B00003CXE7|3.0|I had reservations on seeing Gladiator, after watching countless episodes of Hercules and Xena taking artistic licience to the limits of rationality regarding Roman history. But after the first battle scene, I kinda sat back and waited to see where they would go with it. Its very acurate at showing Rome at its peak, it has awesome fight/battle scenes, and shows that everything in the Gladiator games does inspire modern sports entertainment like pro wrestling. Russel Crowe displayed acting chops and sheer screen presance through out the film, and doesn't appear to be to overly physicly developed for the time it takes place in. My only problem with the movie is that several key plot points seem to have been lifted right out of Braveheart. I dont want to spoil anything, but it just seems weak a movie has to take so much from something else to stand on its own. Fans of Braveheart will know what Im talking about after seeing this movie too.
B00004XONN|4.0|By now you'll have heard all about this album; the allegedly shocking fact that it contains very little guitar (gasp!), how it's going to rejuvenate rock according to some people, how it's an overhyped rich boys' indulgence according to another.  But here in the real world, we listen to an album before judging it.  And it's worth pointing out first of all that everyone who considers themselves a serious music fan should be overjoyed that a bloodymindedly uncommercial album like this one got to number one on both sides of the Atlantic, especially in a musical climate where Coldplay and Muse can be acclaimed as soulful rock heroes for selling a truly flavourless, watered-down imitation of Radiohead.  <br />And then it hits you that it's pretty much impossible to evaluate Kid A without referencing its social context.  It is, whether you like it or not, a vitally important album.  Not only is it the long-awaited follow-up to OK Computer, but it also encapsulates Thom Yorke's dark thoughts on consumerism in a flow of witty, scary and sometimes repulsive dream imagery.  And whereas it doesn't top OK Computer or The Bends, it comes admirably close and should at least be applauded for taking risks.  <br />Musically, it's one surprisingly brief (under 50 mins) essay on claustrophobia and disgust; from the queasy murmurs and keyboard figures of 'Everything In Its Right Place' through the nightmarish lullaby of the title track, ending with 'Motion Picture Soundtrack', their most accomplised tearjerker since 'No Surprises'.  <br />In between we find three songs that form the heart of the album.  'The National Anthem' is built around a metal-tinged bass riff that wouldn't disappoint Marilyn Manson fans, except Manson, for all his savvy, never veered off into an unlistenable but thrilling cacophony of disassociated jazz trumpets.  The apocalyptic, thunderous blues blow-out of 'Optimistic' may be Radiohead's best song ever.  Then there's 'Idioteque', Kid A's dark heart, a stark, punishing keyboards and synth drums duet with Thom Yorke topping OK Computer's 'Climbing Up The Walls' for sheer edge-of-seat terror.  <br />The one star is missing because occasionally they seem a little too reluctant to utilise any of the tricks they pioneered on OK Computer; certainly it seems rather futile to spend ages making bizarre guitar sound effects on songs like 'Airbag' then going for the soft option of antique keyboards.  But in the year 2000, only Kid A speaks truthfully of the times we live in.
B00004ZEQX|2.0|This film is just plain boring, as are most of Fulci's films infact.  There is no atmosphere, the dialogue and some scenes are laughable(and not in a good way) and the dubbing of the main childs voice is incredibly annoying.  The picture quality is pretty good for the price(certainly as good as Anchor Bay's release of Zombie) and the sound quality is also decent, although the music itself seems to burst in and dissapear at the most inappropriate times.  The only reason it doesn't get 1 star is because there is some decent gore, although not enough to save it.  I certainly won't be watching it again.
B000005HN6|5.0|Well I heard of opeth 4 years ago before their stuff were released in USA because a friend got the import version of orchid and I was very pleased with it.May be the only death/black metal element here are the vocals and some blasting guitar riffs but in general is very melodic and acoustic and from my point of view orchid is the best album of opeth <br />Very recomended for fans of the so called &quot;Gothenburg sound&quot;
B0000542DG|3.0|The back cover of this video proclaimed the movie as being a lot different to all of 'those teen slasher films' that you're so very sick of.  I guess you could say it was, but that is not to say that it was a fine piece of cinematic art!<br />You would think it was a blessing to receive a premonition of your death, and subsequently avoid that fate, also saving several of your classmates.  But no.  Death has been cheated and he is not happy about the situation.  So the Grim Reaper goes about claiming these 'lucky' teenagers in its own creatively gross ways, proving that it is more than just a force to be reckoned with.<br />A couple of the death scenes are laughable for how ridiculous they are.  This movie doesn't know whether it wants to be supernatural in a realistic way (such as The Sixth Sense) or just a bit far-fetched and crazy.  This is its downfall.<br />This may sound a little far-fetched itself, but I found the movie a little depressing.  I mean, these people just knew they were going to die, and that the form of their demise wouldn't be pretty.  Thus, the characters spent their whole time fearing death, concerning themselves over who was 'next'.  I don't like to think or worry about death, so this, to me, was the one disturbing aspect of the movie.<br />But hey, the guy who plays Stifler in 'American Pie' was a pleasant surprise to see.  I didn't know he was going to be in it!!<br />It is a good movie to watch for a bit of fun - it will make you jump, yet at the same time... I am still sick to death of teeny slasher films! (Modern ones anyway)
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is, unquestionably the Beatles' best album.  It suits you no matter what mood you are in, whether you are happy, sad, or angry, you can lose yourself in this album and just feel better.  Though many tout Sgt. Pepper's as their, and hence the, best album, Abbey Road is better.  Abbey Road is a masterpiece, easy to listen to, and appropriate to their purpose.  This album, when I first heard it, blew my mind, and changed everything about how I listened to music.  It is not an album that relies on hits, though it has a few of those too, but instead on the sheer quality of the album.  No better album has ever, or ever will be made.
B00003CX8J|4.0|First of all I have to say that I am a die hard X-Men fan...Ever since I was a teen.  I have X-Men #1 comic.  So to say that the movie was some what of a dissapointment is an understatment. But, if a person knew nothing about the topic, it was a brief intro to the theory and storyline.  Oh yeah, and the casting could have been much better....especially for Wolverine....but after all it was a movie, and if it raises interest in X-Men then it did its job.
078401213X|5.0|This movie is darkly brilliant - the B&amp;W, grainy camerawork really adds to the atmosphere.<br />The story of obsession is one we can all relate to, and Max's descent into madness is brilliantly filmed and acted. Although  the cults and corporations trying to steal Max's information are an interesting part of the story, it is the protagonist's internal conflicts that are the center of the film.<br />The R rating is well deserved though, as the hallucination scenes are quite disturbing, and the images of a disembodied brain are positively creepy. <br />I would suggest this one to people who can deal with a movie that is slow-paced in its storytelling, but fast-paced in the way it is shot. The plot is gripping, and the films dark tone will freak you out (esp. if you're on drugs, hint hint..)<br />The extras are great, too...a music video, two trailers, two commentaries, some behind-the scenes footage, and some other stuff.<br />If you've been raised on &quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Twister,&quot; this movie's not for you, however, if you're a fan of cerebral thrillers or the indie scene, it will knock you out.<br />11:15 - restate my assumptions...
0679879269|5.0|I had been waiting for The Amber Spyglass for what seems like forever, and though some events were predictable or clearly had to happen, some things took me totally by surprise. I'll try really hard not to give away any spoilers, but there are a few things I have to comment on. One thing is that while this book is full of page-turning action and interesting, sometimes subtle, charactarization, the most interesting thing about The Amber Spyglass is its theology. It may be somewhat shocking to you if you're used to a Judeo-Christian outlook of things, and you may consider it downright blasphemous, but the book supports its own ideas well, and it does make a lot of sense when you apply other beliefs, Gnostic for example. I do have a few arguments with Pullman's theological assumptions, but they're nessecary for the theme of the book.   And even if you don't like to think deep thoughts about the nature of the universe (although in this book it really does help!) there is plenty of other interesting stuff, such as the additional worlds Pullman introduces, the interesting new characters, and the massive chain of events (although of course the Lyra and Will aren't neglected!), and the conclusion is stunning. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes to think out of the box, who likes stories of other worlds, and especially anyone who has come to care about Lyra and her daemon, Will, Mrs. Coulter, Ioren Byrnson, and the whole bunch (and if you havn't, it's an absolute nessecity you read the first two books, or you may not care much for this book, nevermind being totally left in the dark).
B00004XONN|4.0|It was interesting to see my favorite rock band of the 90s, Radiohead, move into experimental ambient, and techno music which is probably my favorite (yes I learned to spell favorite) music genre. Certainly a big change of style. More so, obviously, than the difference between the Bends and OK Computer. I can't say anything about this albumn was particularly brilliant. I find it very enjoyable. The ambient tracks have a sleepy feel, but Thom York's amazing vocals keep the albumn from being boring, particularly impressive on &quot;How to Disapear..&quot; which is the most beautiful and emotional track on the albumn. Idioteque surprised me. It has fairly good slow pounding electronic beats and a cool disorted synth sequence. Thom uses his vocal phrases as if they were synth patterns and some of them may as well be. Optimistic is the most catchy, pop oriented track. Its cool. I felt the music on &quot;Motion Picture..&quot; didn't really work with the vocals as well as it could have. All in all this is a fun albumn. Its interesting to see Radiohead constantly changing their style.
B000002UDD|5.0|I am a huge Megadeth fan, and a huge 80's metal fan, so I feel qualified to write this review.  I have to admit that I didn't really like this album when I first heard it, but as I took the time to listen to its subtleties, it began to grow on me.  The lyrics and guitar riffs are powerful and addrenilizing.  Trust me, you will never get bored with this album after you've been 'hooked' on it.  Even after listening to it for over seven years, I manage to find a new and better appreciation for Megadeth's musicianship.  While some may complain about Mustaine's voice, I think it is well-suited for the album.  &quot;Liar&quot; is my favorite song, with &quot;In my Darkest hour&quot; coming in a close second place.  In terms of Megadeth's overall career, I would rate this album second best to Rust and Peace.
6305810109|5.0|So I felt compelled to write a review here.  Not especially my style.  I have little to say except that this will be only the third video I have purchased.  Little in film moves me enough to wish to spend money to buy the video.  Simply put, this film just makes me happy.  The acting is superlative.  The story is simple and unencumbered, yet so engaging.  And yes, I am one of those people that have grown tired of exploitative sex, violence and language.  This film has a way of putting you into an introspective mode.  I live in the &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; area.  It is expensive and full of self-centered individuals...maybe I have been like that too.  So, seeing this film, with all its peace, serenity, and genuineness of story made me think about a greater good (sounds so corny I guess)I might consider for my life.  One of more serious concern for those I love.  And one side note:  The musical score is so beautiful and blends in naturally with the entire film.  This is my humble submission to the reviews.  Thank you.
B00002E233|5.0|Deep BLue Sea takes a bit of a different approach than the makers of Jaws did, and i think it was a wise decision.  The film is about Mako sharks that are experimented on to try and find a cure for alzeimers disease.  The unfourunate thing is that due to the experimentation the sharks have become more intelligent and strike back.  What eventually happens is hunt and kill with the humans being the victims this time.  The cast make this film what it is as you dont really have any of the top names so there is no competition for worst over actor.  This film is definetly worth watching and hopefully you will like it that much that you will buy it
0780625129|5.0|At this point I've watched the video at least 7 times and it still has virtually the same impact on me from the first time I saw it.  The whole story of the movie takes place in about 24 hours but seems longer because Danny (Edward Furlong) is reflecting on how his brother's experiences has helped shape his own ideas and attitudes concerning contemporary america.  That is the gist of the film; an essay which Danny was forced to write in one night.  Alot of ground was covered in terms of how kids are shaped and molded by their parents attitudes and by their experiences.  Another reviewer said that the most un-racist person would rethink some of their views while watching the Rodney King argument scene.  The arguement was good in the sense that Derek (Ed Norton) seemed really convinced, but his arguements regarding the LAPD using &quot;text book&quot; procedures on Rodney king was very weak.  I'm very liberal and democratic, yet his arguement didn't make me rethink any of my views one bit.  Basically all he was doing is using the same old right-wing conservative ku klux rhetoric that has been going on since slavery.  Where does this rhetoric get him or anybody else?  The movie makes it clear that there are only two places for people who espouse the views expressed by Derek.<br />The movie begins and ends with a beautiful sunset on an isolated beach.  The music really adds to the surrealness of these two scenes.  Perhaps the one part of the movie which &quot;takes the cake&quot; for me was when Derek walked into Danny's room and looked at the wall filled with nazi posters and then began to help his brother tear everything down without saying a word.  The background music also fit into that (and every other scene) perfectly.  <br />I highly recommend this movie.  The strong language and violence is critical to the film.  The explicit sexual scene in the beginning wasn't necessary, but was fitting.
B00004SCX6|1.0|The entire album sounds exactly the same! BORING! I thought after listening to it a few times I would come to like it. It has only annoyed me. If she doesn't come out with some better material than this her popularity and credibility will certainly die off quick. Britney is definately talented, but this CD is no indication of that talent. Would not recommend!
B00003CXIY|3.0|Hey...  This is a very funny movie.  If you have seen &quot;Something about Mary&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot; and are into movies of this sort, I highly recommend &quot;Road Trip&quot;.  However, don't be swayed with this &quot;unrated&quot; DVD b.s.  It is seriously bogus.  There is nothing new or different than the theatrical version to see.  The seven deleleted scenes are ones that should have been cut because they are so redundant and unnecessary.  Buy this only if you love the version you've seen and will be happy with that.  You get nothing more than 5 mins. of fluff.  <br />Cheers,<br />Jason
0743201140|5.0|This book represents three very ambitious efforts.  One, it argues for a new management paradigm that builds from the psychological make-up of each person in the workplace to create the most effective combination of people and tasks.  Two, the book presents a new psychological mapping scheme to capture those areas where a person will display &quot;consistent near perfect performance in an activity.&quot;  Three, the book connects you to a self-diagnosis tool that you can use on-line to see yourself in the perspective of the new mapping scheme.  Most books would settle for pursing just one these goals.  My hat is off to the authors for their ambition!<br />The concept of building companies around &quot;desirable&quot; pyschological profiles has been in application for some time.  The Walt Disney organization uses this approach to locate people who will enjoy working in their company, and to match the person to the task they will be most focused on.  More and more companies are experimenting with this approach.  The evidence is that it works.<br />So the first argument simply takes that experience one step further by formalizing it a bit.  The book has many persuasive examples of how people usually do not have jobs that use their best talents.  This provides another perspective on the Peter Principle. So far so good.<br />Next, 34 patterns of mental habits are described based on millions of interviews over 25 years.  These include achiever, activator, adaptability, analytical, arranger, belief, command, communication, competition, connectedness, context, deliberative, developer, discipline, empathy, fairness, focus, futuristic, harmony, ideation, inclusiveness, individualization, input, intellection, learner, maximizer, positivity, relator, responsibility, restorative, self-assurance, significance, strategic, and woo.  You need to see the descriptions to understand what these patterns reflect.<br />The argument is that these labels capture patterns of thinking habits that condition behavior in any situation.  I find it difficult to relate to all of the patterns because there are so many.  Also, without knowing what patterns work well in a particular job, I wasn't sure how relevant they are.  Connection of patterns to success needs to be shown as cause and effect in a given company before this will be totally useful.<br />Small companies may not be able to use this tool very well because they will never have enough people doing the same task to figure out which profile is best.  Everyone working in that role may have a very inappropriate profile.  You will just be picking the best of a poorly-fitting lot if you select around one of them.<br />Then, I took the personality test on-line.  There were no surprises there for me in my top 5 patterns.  I also suspect that there would be no surprises for you in putting me into these categories.  You would probably have pegged me as an achiever, learner, relator, focus, input person from the fact that I read so many nonfiction books, write so many book reviews, and keep books and notes everywhere (just in case I might need them again).  On the relator front, if you had noticed who I like to work with and how I work with them, you would have spotted me in a few days.<br />However, my actual job competence is a lot different from this.  Most clients tell me that they find me most helpful to them when exposing them to new perspectives on their work that allow them to make faster progress.  So, I was left wondering if the tool is strong enough to do the task of making people most effective in their work without more help.  Someone might develop or be born with a great talent that has little to do with the psychological profile of how she or he likes to spend their time.<br />To state the opposite proposition to the ones in the book, complexity science would suggest that it is a mistake to overly organize the workplace in any way.  You should have as much diversity as possible.  When we leave lots of room for open space and time, people will self-organize outstanding solutions.  Having people focused on tasks they love might make them less aware of what else needs to be done.  Behavioral scientists would argue that learning continues throughout life, and that major new habits can be formed at any time.  Old dogs can learn new tricks.  Why cannot new psychological mindsets be learned as well.  I suspect that they can.  These kinds of counter-observations were not addressed in the book, and it would have been helpful to me if they had been.<br />So while I was impressed by the concept that the &quot;great organization must not only accommodate the fact each is different; it must capitalize on these differences,&quot; I wasn't sure that the authors have the best method to get there yet.<br />I do recommend that you read the book and consider its messages.  I suspect that its application will work best in focusing people on tasks that require great persistence and consistency in order to be effective.  I am less clear on how well it will work to help people accomplish more in creative tasks.  Time will tell.<br />I suggest that you take the test and discuss your results with someone else who has also taken the test.  Ask each other what insights you got from your own results and from hearing the other person's results.  That discussion should start to help you imagine ways to use these insights more effectively.<br />May you always &quot;derive intrinsic satisfaction&quot; from the activities you do!When we leave lots of room for open space and time, people will self-organize outstanding solutions.

0719043263|5.0|This is not some dry academic tome, but is an approachable work with a fresh style. Although I read this outside of the classroom, and both enjoyed and benefited from it, as an experienced instructor, Peter Barry is actually providing a textbook .  Each theory includes a 'Stop and Think' section that contains questions which zero in on its essential aspects or weaknesses.  Major theorists are discussed and they are placed into a historical and cultural context. Each theory has a concise list of bullet points on what critics of that school actually do, or how they interpret literary works.  The chapters conclude with lists of recommended readings, including annotations on their significance and how best to read or approach them.<br />He does a marvelous job of placing literary theory into a context as the most recent series of attempts to answer questions that have been ongoing at least since Victorian times.  The introduction is perhaps the most important part of the book.  While someone highly familiar with a particular theory may wish to skip the corresponding chapter, I recommend reading the first chapter.  It has helpful advice on critical reading skills, and especially useful suggestions on how to effectively approach a new theory.  The second chapter, &quot;Liberal Humanism,&quot; is basically a discussion of what critics do who do not partake of a particular theory, which is the historical background against which the theorists are reacting.  This chapter is also essential reading, as it concludes with a discussion of recurrent ideas that are common across most literary theories.  He sums them up as 1) politics is pervasive, 2) language is constitutive, 3) truth is provisional, 4) meaning is contingent, and 5) human nature is a myth.  He suggests that any reader having difficulty grasping a particular theory review this list, as most theory concepts turn out to be some variation of one of these ideas.<br />My feelings about literary theory are complex and ambivalent.  It certainly seems like a tailor-made job security program for uninspired academics (especially Deconstruction).  Choosing a career with constant pressure to publish or perish, the appeal of a discipline that accepts completely fanciful interpretations of other's works as legitimate research is undeniable.  Even worse, theory is often used to promulgate social and political agenda under the guise of  scholarship.  In spite of these negative tendencies, several literary theories actually make a certain sense to me, and each of them offers useful insights when carefully applied and not treated as a religious or moral imperative.  I encourage the skeptic to read this book also-one doesn't need to accept the validity of each theory in order to benefit from their recognition<br />The subtitle of &quot;Beginning Theory&quot; includes the words &quot;literary and cultural theory.&quot;  While Barry concentrates on the literary aspects, the theories he presents are certainly widely applied in much contemporary writing.  A level of cultural literacy necessary to fully appreciate the Book Review supplement of major newspapers requires at least nodding familiarity with their concepts and major proponents.  The popular understanding of many of the 'isms' of our day, such as 'racism', 'sexism', 'colonialism',  certainly have philosophical roots in Marxist criticism.   Post-modern critical ideas are widely applied in cultural situations, and like a dead fish, Freudian interpretation always seems to be floating on top of the water.  The philosophical and social ideas influenced by these theories are widespread, and are certainly not limited to obscure academic journals on literary criticism-I've concluded that whether I agree with the ideas or not, they are part of an essential cultural vocabulary.  (Undoubtedly, the proponents of any particular theory are much harsher on competing theories than any of the readers of this book will be.)<br />Given my morbid fascination with literary theory, perhaps it isn't surprising that I found this an exciting book.  Barry has written what is effectively the Guide Michelin for literary theory.   This is an excellent starting point for a difficult topic, and the author's lucid discussion of complex ideas is brilliant.  Although his personal opinions occasionally appear in the form of his wry wit, his playful approach to competing theories is relatively open-minded, helping the reader discover both their advantages and internal inconsistencies.  <br />This book is well-written, informative, and an excellent resource.  I highly recommend it.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I have to say that i actually like this album.  It you put aside all the hate you have for brittany and the past judgements on her previous outings and just listen this album i think you might like this.  With songs like Lucky, Oops I Did It Again and Stronger it shows that Brittany is improving her talent even if it is at a slow pace.  Take this album for what it is, pop filled, and never destinated to be in your top ten favourite albums of all time.  Enjoy
0679600019|5.0|The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This CD is just amazing. I was introduced to the Red Hot Chilli Peppers more than a year ago. I bought this CD as soon as it came out. This CD is one of the rare ones that I actually like all the songs on it. Each one is a favorite so I really can't say which ones stand out the most. I think the Red Hot Chilli Peppers deserve all the awards that they have won for this CD because it is just remarkable. Anthony's lyrics are beautiful as always and now that john's back in the Peppers they sound as if they have a reignited passion for making the great music they always have made. Flea is a god when it comes to bass and he outdoes himself on this CD. You can tell that the Chili Peppers put a huge amount of work to make this the best album that they have done. They've evolved from their original style to incorporating every style you can think of to give their fans what they love. I hope that they keep playing together forever because they are my alltime favorite band. This is one band I would want my kids to listen to when I'm older. I hope that there's still more to come for this awesome band. RHCP rock!
0553573411|5.0|Again, 4.5 Stars.<br />I couldn't wait to begin this book after having read Assassin's Apprentice.  I wasn't disappointed.<br />This book is even better than the first, in terms of style, plot, character and overall grandeur.  The plot becomes more complex and exciting, Fitz (the main character) takes on even more realism than in the first book, which is a feat in itself.<br />In Book 2, Hobb shows more of her world and, more importantly, her system of magic.  Although not &quot;overwhelmingly unique&quot; in the Fantasy genre, her use of magic is both subtle yet powerful - she knows where to use it and where not to use it.  The relationships between the characters are well-formed and become increasingly complex in this book, as well.<br />If you've enjoyed Assassin's Apprentice, you certainly won't be disapponted with Book 2 - it only builds on Book 1.
B000056HOZ|5.0|as a huge Springsteen fan, and a proud owner of the old VHS format &quot;Video anthology&quot;, i was very glad to be informed  of this new collection.     I think you must have it if you are a Boss fan. You'll enjoy it, thats for sure.
0393038912|4.0|This is a clear and very readable book on the evolution of humankind, I really enjoyed it. My only comment is that it really only rehashes what scholars have been saying for decades. A good companion book is &quot;The Rise and Fall of Great Powers&quot;.
B000002GGU|5.0|Without no doubt, &quot;Reckless&quot; ranks among the top rock albums released during the 1980's. Canadian rocker Bryan Adams, who made many successful albums during the decade and up to the early 1990's, made this landmark album at a time when only American artists were able to make it big in the US market. Before Adams, the only other foreign artist to make it big was Australian rocker/ator Rick Springfield. Adams was one of the first artists from America's northern neighbor to make a successful debut stateside, and his success paved the way for many Canadian artists such as Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Deborah Cox, and Alanis Morissette to do the same.<br />While many of the songs are memorable, my favorite three songs are &quot;Heaven,&quot; &quot;Summer of '69,&quot; and &quot;Run to You.&quot; The latter song, which is a classic in 80's rock, captures your imagination with an incredible beat and sound, and especially with Bryan's earthy vocals. &quot;Heaven,&quot; a great ballad also was one of my favorite slow songs from that decade, while the &quot;Summer of '69&quot; gave me a feeling of nostalgia, although I did not exist in 1969.<br />Along with &quot;Waking Up the Neighbors,&quot; this album ranks as one of the top two Bryan Adam's albums ever. If you're a child of the 80's, this album will take you on a trip down memory lane.
B000000JO3|5.0|Ahhhh, yes...Minor Threat. These guys were a great band who unfortunately did not last too long (see also Operation Ivy). Complete Discography compiles everything these guys did. The music is loud, fast and Ian just puts his all into the vocals. The lyrics are very political and match the frantic rhythms put out by the band. Although the songs are very short, these guys put more into a one minute song than most bands could put into a five minute song. Slipknot and Limp Bizkit ARE NOT hardcore; Minor Threat is. If you are a fan of punk, this is something you should own. Also check out Ian's band Fugazi.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural, as many of Pearl Jam's other albums, is incredible. Pearl Jam is already considered one of the great bands of our time, but if they keep releasing albums like this one, they will go down as legends. This is a title that I think Pearl Jam already deserves. Binaural is at least as good as all of Pearl Jam's other albums. All 13 of the songs on this album are great. Some of the songs, however, do stand out over the rest. Breakerfall is one of their best rockers. It is really an incredible song. Light Years and Nothing As It Seems are both incredible as well. Thin Air is one of my favorite songs on the album and it is one of their best slower songs. The songs Rival, Insignifigance and Sleight of Hand also stand out. the rest of the songs are all great, but these are my favorites. This album supports the fact that Pearl Jam is one of the great groups of our time and that they will become one of the legends of rock.
B00000IQUT|3.0|While a good movie, this flick was WAY to overacted. The not-so-original plot is a young woman from New York moves to a secluded summer home to write her first novel. A half-retarded grocery store delivery boy named Matthew gets a crush on her and tells his redneck friends about her. They decide that she will be the woman that the Matthew loses his virginity to, so they rape her, beat her, and leave her for dead. She recovers and begins murdering her assailants in horrible ways. <br />Blood and gore galore, I'd consider this movie, or the unrated version at least, a soft porn with gore. More of an exploitation film, violence and nudity are the main stars. This movie is definitely not for people with weak stomachs.
B00003CX6P|4.0|This is a tight thriller.  Matt Damon once again proves that he can act and is no real fluke.  So does Gwyneth Paltrow.  On top of that you have a cast rounded out by Jude Law and Philip Seymore Hoffman, and excellent directing by Anthony Minghella.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This Cd is ROCKS!  I remember when I first heard Gurilla Radio, it was on the radio and by the end of the song, I was in shock, the guitar sonds just blew me away.  So the very next day I went out and bought the Cd.  I listened to every song and each time I was like &quot;Whew!&quot;  That usaully doesn't happen to me, mostly I just go &quot;Oh, it's over?&quot;  But on this Cd, the have more than enough hard core music crammed into each song.  <br />Me and my friends are all the same way, we like original music.  I can think of very few hard rock bands today that are actually original.  To many of them are to wierd of sing about drugs, sex, and violence all the time, this is one of few that doesn't have that stuff on it.  I think that this Cd should inspire some other bands to stop being so wierd and go ORIGINAL!
B00004U2HK|1.0|Sickeningly sweet, and relentlessly cheerful, the continuing endurance of this movie baffles me beyond belief.  By now the story is well known -- young woman becomes governess to seven children in 1930's Austria.  Their father is a stern captain who has known no joy since his wife's death.  Said young woman spontaneously bursts into song, the children adore her, and the captain finds joy again until the Nazi's put an end to their fun at which point they escape Austria.  Even Maria Von Trapp, the woman on whose life this story was based, did not care for this film and it is amazing that it is not required to come with a saccharine warning label.
B00002SWEM|5.0|Just as the title commands, buy this DVD now! The Buena Vista Social club is the Cuba Super-Group! It features the greatest musicians of the 60s and 70s together on one stage playing the songs that they themselves made popular. The DVD not only chronicles the music, but the men behind the music and they're lives. Most of it is subtitled... But this sort of thing has to be. A dub would only take away from the beauty of this film.  The Magic of these performers take you away to another place.. Ah, its a wonderful film. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in music.
B00003CXE7|1.0|The one star is for Scotts use of that much film without losing his guild card. The pacing of this movie, with the exception of several fight scenes, is leaden. Regardless of what is happening, everyone moves at the same slow pace. Even when the bad guys are hot on the trail, the good guys just sleepwalk through another scene. This might be because this 2.5 hr movie only has 1.25 hrs of plot. Even with all this extra time, nobody thought to add a little dialogue to clean up all the loose ends. For example, after the early battle, he says he wants to go home to his farm &amp; family. If he had said his farm was in Spain (easily done)then it would make sense that he was called the Spaniard when he was a slave. This is just one of many examples of this films many failures.<br />Save your money or buy some porn. The dialogue is almost as good and the acting is better.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|What can I say about &quot;Cats&quot;, Wow! This stage play put on video and DVD is amazing. I received the DVD as a gift, before which time I had never seen &quot;Cats.&quot;<br />One of the things I noticed was that it took me no time at all to believe the actors were &quot;Cats.&quot; The make-up, choreography, and music outstanding! I found myself singing along with the cast. Makes me want to be a cat!<br />This play also makes me question, were people at one time &quot;Cats&quot;? Andrew Lloyd Webber has made a fan and a believer out of me. I found &quot;The Making of Cats&quot; an interesting documentary. The documentary can be found as an extra feature on the DVD.<br />The whole family can enjoy cats. Can't recommend it enough.
B0000365JA|1.0|If you're not convinced that Bryan Adams must be stopped after lisenting to this album, you probably are beyond help. Adams is the worst of incencere radio pop, and if rock and roll is really dead someone had better check Bryan for the smoking gun.  It's a rare artist whose can add artistic legimacy to his career by doing a song with a Spice Girl.
B00003CX6P|4.0|THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY: What makes this story so hypnotic? Obviously, it is Ripley's character, but understanding that requires more than a focus on its pathology. Rather, we need to acknowledge that most of us have experienced in our lives that awkward and sometimes pathetic characteristic which, in Ripley's case, forms the soil of that pathology. I am speaking of the teen years, when the self has not fully formed, when we lack an established sense of who we are, and when we still half-depend on others exposing us to their interests and activities in order for us to engage the world. For some, this occurs just before the teen years; for others, well into them. At this stage, when we are most susceptible to peer pressure, we may indeed possess true interests without accepting them - or ourselves - as worthy. Ripley has failed to mature. Well past his teens, he does have interests and dreams of his own, but is mostly excluded from their realization. Few of his activities even approach his real dreams. Obviously, the compromises he has made amount to nearly complete surrender. The dynamism, spontaneity, and luxury of Dickie's world overwhelm him. His lack of conviction in his own values and his cleverness at pretending combine with fate to turn his thwarted development into deadly avenues. In essence, Ripley reminds us of those we have known before they developed emotionally into adults. He is not just a financial leech. He clings to Dickie for excitement, for his dynamic personality, for his spontaneity and style, and finally to stimulate a thwarted eroticism. Dickie lives on impulse, unmindful of consequences, unstructured and self-centered. In a sense, Dickie is also not fully mature, but he nevertheless becomes Ripley's conduit to the world.  In evaluating this film, the crucial question is how well does the movie depict Ripley's psychology? I say very well indeed. Even if director Minghella's commentary had not revealed the deliberation with which he revealed that psychology throughout the film, the pacing and cutting do so. There is a difference between the early and late sections of the film. The early part creates the feeling that Ripley's external world is unintegrated, whereas the last part makes us feel the lack of internal wholeness even as Ripley juggles his stories to maintain consistency in his lies. Minghella does this by jumping from one vignette of the New York Ripley to another very quickly, and allowing the later scenes to endure longer as the stories spun by Ripley become totally unpredictable. Ripley has become spontaneous, lurching from one situation and person to the next with an impromptu slide show. Minghella states his treatment of the New York scene was dictated by time constraints, but I find it hard to believe he was not aware of the change it implied in the evolution of Ripley's psychology. Minghella reveals this understanding when he states in the commentary that for Ripley, NOT getting caught is a punishment.  The exposition of the other characters' inner lives is equally masterful. Here Dickie appears to be an exception, but in fact he is supposed to be superficial, and we can learn little of his inner life. Although Minghella rightfully gives credit to the cast's talents, it is an unavoidable conclusion that as director, he has gotten the best of the stellar talents of his cast. Unlike so many Hollywood directors, Minghella is not full of him self. He chose his actors and actresses well, and has gotten the best from them. The choice of Damon has been criticised, but was, in fact, a good decision. He was well able to convey the fear of being himself. I do criticize Damon's singing, but dubbing would have been worse, costing some of the film's feel of authenticity.  Minghella states that Italy itself became a character in the film. I disagree. The film could have been shot in any other place that was a 50's watering hole for American expatriates and made the point of being very foreign to the characters. France would have done as well. The director's romance with Italy is understandable, and because it does the film no harm, is a benign indulgence.  This is a film I highly recommend to those who prefer character to action. The story and character exposition are excellent, and interruptions will be difficult to bear. I rate few films with 5 stars, but this would deserve it, except for the final test: Would I watch this DVD again a year from now? Unfortunately, the answer is &quot;no&quot;, but only because much of the enjoyment of this film is the curiosity it evokes concerning the outcomes of the situations it depicts. Like many mysteries (but not the very best), the full knowledge of the plot detracts from the enjoyment of subsequent viewings. The DVD too is full of good extras, and deserves a bare 5, my main criticism focussing on the video quality. It is good, but not excellent as are most of the other attributes of this album.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This IS by far the best, most beautifully written, and animated animated film in existance. If harsh reviewers from The New York Post call it &quot;The Star Wars of animated films&quot; then my words truly are the truth. I have seen many, many anime films; for a long time Akira was the reigning king of anime. Akira has be knocked off, Princess Mononoke rules in its place.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Well I shall tell you. It's the best album to date from Limp Bizkit, not to mention one of the best albums to come on the scene. Fred Durst gets the point across in every song, and no matter who you are you can relate to what he's saying in his songs. And yes I'm a 15 year old &quot;wigger&quot; if that is what you choose to call me, but I'm also a skater, a punk, a prep, and a pop(popular). This album fits everbody.
B00004T9UH|5.0|Whoa. This CD is awesome. I've listened to both the edited and unedited versions and the only difference I found was that bad words are edited and The Kids was on the edited and Kim was on the unedited. They are both great songs. I am 12 years old and have the edite version of the CD. I would recommend the edited for kids my age though.
0385501005|2.0|I had such high hopes for this fresh take on the male perspective.  Mr. Commitment by Mike Gayle has been called the &quot;male Bridget Jones&quot; and, I was so hoping for that.   But, I was really let down.  I found this book boring, uninspired, and a big ole' bunch of nothing.  I'm not really sure what the plot was, I didn't care about the characters.  If you want a look into the mind of a man...check out &quot;Come Together&quot; by Josie Lloyd, Emlyn Rees.  You'll find a deeper look into the mysterious world of a guy.  This one will leave you feeling disappointed.

B000003TA4|5.0|It was really good! I  loved it. I hope Ill here it again
B00004RHZU|5.0|I'm just writing to say that this is by far the best album of the year and Pink is an amazing artist! Nobody can match her vocals, her voice is so soulful. The 5 minutes and 52 seconds of &quot;Stop Falling&quot; anre the most riveting and wonderful on the album, but it is all a phenominal work. Please don't classify this as teen pop. It's so much more. Amazing.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This album is really great!!  My mom even likes it..and that's saying a lot, seeing as how she doesn't listen to anything but Barbra Streisand and stuff like that.  If you're looking for an up-beat Christmas album to buy, this one is the best choice!  I highly recommend it!  This is the kind of album that you could listen to in July!  Christina has a beautiful voice (unlike Britney Spears who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket!) and she really shows it in this album, even more than her others.  Do you see Britney Spears with a Christmas album?  I don't think so.  Christina is gonna hit Britney...in her wallet!  That should say enough!  BUY THIS ALBUM!! IT'S GREAT!
B000002BHE|5.0|&quot;Falling into You&quot; is a classic pop album, surely to be cherished by many future generations. Any album that opens with &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot;, one of the greatest songs ever written, is surely a winner. And that's not even counting the elaborate production it receives from its writer Jim Steinman and Celine Dion's incredible vocal performance. It gives me goosebumps every single time. Other standout instant classic tracks include &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; , &quot;Falling into You&quot;, &quot;Seduces Me&quot; and of course &quot;All By Myself&quot;, that great Eric Carmen/Rachmaninoff song, all beautifully sung by Celine. Only those without any good taste of popular music and those prejudiced mainstream popular music haters will not like such tunes. Anyway, it's their own loss. The rest of us will always know that the world is a better place, if only as long as any Celine Dion album lasts.
0679879269|5.0|There are few books that do not allow me to stop reading them.  This was one of them.  I stayed up until 3:30 a.m. (with work the next day, even!) to finish it in an instance of marathon reading that I have never attempted before.<br />It was worth it.<br />I loved the Golden Compass, I liked the Subtle Knife, but I am head over heels for the Amber Spyglass.  Characters coalesce into real people, with motivation and reasons for being.  For example, in the Subtle Knife, Will seemed to be a character who was very hard to understand or sympathize with (even if you, like I, liked him).  In the Amber Spyglass, however, he is determined to find his mother again, which is so heartbreakingly childlike that it paints a much better picture of Will than was ever seen in the Subtle Knife.  As for Lyra, she goes from being a hard-shelled, unreachable preadolescent to an adult with a hidden, quiet purpose (not to say she loses her fiery spirit in the process!)  Look also for Mary Malone (a wonderful woman), Iorek Byrnison, Serafina Pekkala, and many other beloved characters.<br />And there is a myriad of other characters introduced as well.  The relationship between two newly introduced angels is very bittersweet and sorrowful.  (Not, as one reviewer said, &quot;icky.&quot;  Grow up.)  Some of our favorite deceased characters make new appearances, which is always fun.<br />The book's approach to God and the afterlife is a new, refreshing one.  To tell the truth, we don't need another author preaching the promise of the afterlife and God's love for us all.  The situation presented in the Amber Spyglass is intriguing in its originality and force.  It poses us with questions to answer that most books cannot.  (Is God really the Creator?  What is the &quot;Kingdom&quot; of Heaven?  What happens to us after we die?)<br />One thing, though -- the ending to this book, while filled with hope and promise, is unspeakably sad.  I was left with a sense of sorrow that gnawed at me long afterI put the book down and finally turned off my bedside lamp.  This is not a happy book, but it is not a despairing one.  It is a book about sacrifice, trust, love, and, most of all, hope.  It is one of the most incredible pieces of literature I have read in a long, long time.
0679879269|3.0|This book is really 3.5 stars. Philip Pullman had a great story idea for his books, but I thought he made them much too religiously orianted. This book has well-devoloped charecters, a good plot, and many other good things. If you like sci-fi or fantasy, I would suggest that you buy this book. :-)
0140042393|5.0|This is the best novel I have read since &quot;The Choosen&quot;. It truely does show the hardships the Joads went through on their search for work and home during the 1930's depression era.  Although it does have an uncanny ending, I suggest you read it!
6301966988|5.0|ahhhh, Sam (Patrick Swayze) is in here help i hope he killes Willie and Carol i am so happy hell got them. I like this because &quot;No Rita Miller&quot; That was the best part in the movie it RULES! It is about a Spititual Reader (Woppi Goldberg) who has a gift of hearing ghosts. Sam contacts her to warn Molly(Demi Moore) that she will be killed. And Sam went to heaven and Willie and Carol hell.
B000002UAU|5.0|....This album is the Beatles at their finest!  Immediatley, you hear the murmur in the crowd right before the title song 'Sgt. Pepper's' comes on.  After the title song, you hear &quot;Billllyyy Shearrrrrssss&quot; and the CD launches into 'With A Little Help From My Friends'. It was later turned into a theme song for a show I can't remember, the one in the 80's with that Savage person.  Anyway, the third track is 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds', which is one of the best songs ever made.  Next is 'Getting Better', which is heard on the Philips TV ads.  After that is 'Fixing A Hole' and 'She's Leaving Home'.  While maybe not the best songs, they fill in quite nicely. After that is the funny 'Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite'. Next is George's song, 'Within You Without You', which is superb.  Then there is 'When I'm 64', which is hilarious.  The next two songs, 'Lovely Rita' and 'Good Morning Good Morning' are well done, as is the 'Sgt. Peppers' reprise. Finally, in the best mix of horror and comedy, 'A Day In The Life' plays.  What a song.  Beautifully done. I really like the alarm clock that's included after 'the band begins to play'. So, there's the whole album layed out in front of you.  Please buy it. Sgt. Peppers is more then worth the money. was perfect (except for maybe some of the songwriting). I need say nothing about the production values.<br />All in all you can say what you want, but popular music was never the same after Sgt. Pepper. Anything less than 5 stars would be downright disrespectful.
B00000JCEC|3.0|With several producers it's hard for any project to sound &quot;together&quot; and hear we have alot of pop trendiness thrown in the mix: &quot;What Goes Around&quot; &quot;In A Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Runaways&quot; are barely throw-away B-sides. &quot;Don't Know A Thing About Love&quot; is one of a small group of Beatle-esque entries, worth hearing on occasion. However, there is a blockbuster here: &quot;Don't Go Where The Road Don't Go&quot;, a solid rocker which should have been a high rotation item for Starr. (I don't recall hearing it once on the radio!). I've purchased albums on the strength of one track, and if you too are so inclined, check out TIME TAKES TIME.
1878424319|4.0|This fast-reading volume offers a lot more than I expected.  It is a profound statement based on the ancient Toltec Mexican-related religious wisdom that is as valuable today as it was in ancient times.  The teachings are quite simple, and they encourage you to live purposely and help you grow.  There's much to ponder to help you achieve this growth.  In the modern life, everything is so complex.  It's refreshing to read about the simple things you can do in your daily life, to help you really live a good, personally satisfaction-filled life.  It gets you to realize THAT YOUR LIFE IS GOOD, and you can take comfort in that, and grow personally.  Very worthwhile reading. Read it and share it with those you love.

0553212443|5.0|This is the perfect book for Christmas reading. It is a short story that most of us are familiar with but may have not taken the time to actually read. I have seen versions of it on TV, movies, and this year even seen a good performance of it done in a play. This year I decided to pick up the book and devote a little bit of time to reading the story. It of course is a classic written by one of the greatest writers ever, Charles Dickens. The story has a lot of meaning and reminds us that we should be aware of how we treat others not only at Christmas time but in all we do. Ebenezer Scrooge may be in us all at one time or another but like him there is time for redemption if we allow ourselves to reflect and appreciate what we have and are  willing to be giving of ourselves to others.
6305810109|5.0|Lynch is back in &quot;Elephant Man&quot; territory, telling a straightforward tale about a real-life and sympathetic protagonist's strange adventures.  (And, as with &quot;Elephant Man&quot; and the pairing of Lynch's name with producer Mel Brooks, it's disorienting to see Lynch's name here following Walt Disney's.)  I wondered, as with the other movie, how Lynch would avoid the inevitable sentimental finish, and, as he did before, he ends this one powerfully by going the opposite way you'd expect.<br />Farnsworth underplays to the point where you might wonder if he's playing at all, but try to imagine anyone else handling the role better.  There are moments when all I remember is his face, particularly those eyes, and those are the most powerful moments of all.  (Such a loss.)  Spacek is a revelation in a supporting role, and Angelo Badalamenti's lovely score compelled me to buy the CD the next day.  This one ain't for the MTV crowd, but for the right viewers, it's a classic.
6304071868|2.0|I watched this film as a kid and felt oh wow!  I see it as an adult who studies WWII history on a regular basis and felt that the only reason this film made it was because Richard Attenborough packed so many big name stars into his picture.  I'd rather read the book.
B000002J09|2.0|About a year and a half ago, I wrote a review on this album. I said, &quot;Please, for the love of God, someone cut out Robert Plant's vocal chords.&quot; My point of view has changed somewhat over the course of a year in a half. I have gained an appreciation for Plant's vocals. In fact, I like all of Led Zeppelin's albums from I to Physical Graffiti (except for IV).  Obviously, this is an overrated album, but what it really comes down to is that Led Zeppelin is an overrated band in general. I'm not saying that I don't like their music. People keep talking about this band like they are some great wonderful anomaly of music. I mean, come on, they were a rock band not an art rock band. As far as the album goes, there is some decent material here. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is quite good, but at the same time, it too is overrated. It is a good song, maybe even a great song, or maybe even Led Zeppelin's greatest song, but the title of &quot;Best Rock Song Of All Time&quot; is not one that should be used freely and taken lightly. I happen to like the song a great deal, but there are songs from the 90's (and even the 80's, god forbid) that I would have to put in front of it. As far as the album goes, a lot of the songs here are just plain weak. Perhaps some of them are mildly catchy, but songs like &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; and &quot;Four Sticks&quot; are just irritating. What really kills this album is the production. &quot;Black Dog&quot; is a pretty good rock song, but Jim Page's guitar sounds so bad on this song that I tend never to listen to it. What it comes right down to is that, when compared to Led Zeppelin's more &quot;artistic&quot; works, this is really nothing more than a collection of pop songs (&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; being the exception). I don't hate this album, but on the other hand I can't honestly say that I would recommend it to anyone who is remotely serious about music.
B00003CXE7|5.0|You are not going to learn a lot about history by watching this movie but I found it very entertaining.  Unlike one of the other reviews, I thought it had a great ending.  Obviously I will not go into details and spoil it but I thought it was very fitting.<br />Some parts are predictable and far-fetched and this is a very violent movie.  I put it in the same class as Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan which were both great movies.  If these movies offended you I would suggest not watching this one.  <br />While watching this movie I tried to imagine what it must have been like to be alive in that era.  Walking into the arena not knowing what or who you would be facing with a very likely chance that you would not be walking out is very erie....
B000005RST|5.0|WARNING: . People, never shut doors and windows and turn the lights off and lay on bed, when listening to Principles of Lust... . A door started to appear in my closet and an Angel came out with her hands stretched wide open and started to take me so far into space and out of my body. . When I came back (Song was finished) I didn't know what had happen. . Volume 10 is the SAFEST!
B00000IOSU|5.0|Back in 1998 I took a liking to Sarah McLachlan with her newest, full-lenth Album, Surfacing. It was a beautiful, addicting, sweet album that turned me into a huge Sarah fan. Now, two years later, I have...well practically everything, every album, video, and whatever. Mirrorball, while being sarah's first live album, was just a little distraction for sarah to go on break. Yet in it's jewel case rests a very good cd, dispite the little plot behind it. (She deserves a break anyway) Mirrorball comprisise of 6 songs from Surfacing, 6 songs from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy(FTE, her third album), 1 from Solace(her second album), and a song that was in the soundtrack for &quot;The Brothers McMullan(spelling?).&quot; Starting off with a known song, &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; takes on a more edgy version of itself while really empahsising the one &quot;F-word&quot; in it, make if a breath of fresh air to it's album version. Unfortunetly, if you listen to other live version of it they all sound the same. &quot;Hold On,&quot; the next song, introduced a whole new side to itself. I found myself really liking this new sound, compared to the old fast acoustic guitar and not quite on chord older version, and it quickly became one of my favorites. &quot;Good Enough,&quot; begans to play right after and sounds a bit more life to it's somewhat &quot;wooden&quot; album counterpart. &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;Good Enough&quot; both seem to go well together, and I've always thought of them almost as sisters, anyway... Next, the radio driven &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; has made a great inprovement to the older version, and really brings in the fresh air to the song. &quot;Do What You Have to Do&quot; Made a few improvements with more emotion and a piano solo, which added quite a bit more sweet sorrow to it. &quot;I Love You&quot; while a great song, sounded a jaded on this live album, but had a thurough, more complete guitar solo, that just sounded better. The next song from Solace, entitled &quot;the Path of Thorns,&quot; sounded better holding more energy than it's original version, which sounded tired and constant. &quot;Fear&quot; took on a greater sense of haughting to it, which really ended up electrifying it, while reaching some pretty nice high notes! While the Album version is great, &quot;Possession&quot; really took off with added energy, strength, and emotion, making it a favorite. While it contains great power and just plain rocks, Sarah strains her voice just a wee bit too much, her voice sounds better on the album version(which rocks too!). If you ask me, &quot;Ice Cream&quot; just sounds a whole lot better on acoustic guitar than piano. Sarah, Ash(Drummer, and hubby), and Brian(bassist) really added magic to this performance. While &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; seems to take on a more upbeat sound, it just doesn't, in my opinion, quite make it to the level of the Album version. It's a good song, but a lot of the live version didn't really make the cut for me. &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; make a huge improvement with a better sounding sythisized orchestra, a little audible piano, and a spectacular guitar solo at the end. &quot;Fumbling&quot; really rates high with this version for sure! The last song, &quot;Angel,&quot; adds more emotion to the constant album version, but unfortunetly was overrun with crowd noise. It's a beautiful song, but teeny boppers don't have to go and ruin it! Some people didn't like this album because it had fading in between and didn't really sound like a live perfomance. Some people didn't like it because it had too much crowd noise. But despite what you've heard, I also highly recomend getting &quot;Mirrorball DVD,&quot; not VHS, DVD. VHS just doesn't do it justice! It was all taped in two nights and it just like a &quot;real&quot; performance, plus it has nine songs that weren't on Mirrorball, that really had to be there, like more songs from Solace, and Fumbling. While it was a dissapointment to some, I absolutly loved every minute of it! Buy it, and if you have some more cash, buy the DVD video! If you like Sarah McLachlan and would like to talk, email me at Xarecses@sarahfan.com (Surfacing made me a fan, but Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, made me a Fumbler!)
0345347951|5.0|I recently reread Arthur C. Clarke's &quot;Childhood's End&quot; and wound up rediscovering my youthful fascination with science fiction.  <br />This is the good stuff.  Clarke always told his stories with an Englishman's placid tone.  You won't find much in the way of titillation in his tales unless it's the frisson one gets upon seeing an imaginative concept brilliantly executed.  <br />In &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, Clarke gives us a distinctly different sort of alien invasion than the laser-and-bomb battles we're used to from decades of movies and novels.  Clarke's Overlords simply hover above our cities, unapproachable and immune to harm.  When the initial furor dies down, they start to execute their plan.  <br />The tale spans generations and never flags in its ability to grab and hold the reader's attention.  The ending is absolutely shocking and yet fits the narrative perfectly.  <br />If you enjoy science fiction or have been looking to dip a toe in the genre's deep well, check out &quot;Childhood's End&quot;.
6305011575|4.0|In watching Tommy Lee Walace's adaption of the Steven King novel, one can't help but feel cheated during certain portions of the film.  The first half of the film is really quite good; the character development and the way they are each seperately introduced into the story is very well done.  The subtle appearences of Pennywise and other horrific appearences are staggered throughout.  This helps to build suspense, and make the film a bit more spooky. Tim Curry's portrayal as the sinister clown is very convincing, and it is possible to find him funny from time to time, but as the film unravels more, so does the plot and horror.  The film grows less and less scary, and the ending is just ridiculous.  Pennywise truely steals the show, and sometimes the other characters fall a little short.  However, it is a worth while film to see, but the vhs presentation is kind of poor.  However, I believe it adds to the gritty, almost dirty cinematography, and makes the film that much more terrifying.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I must admit, I did not purchase the previous offering by LB but enjoyed it thoroughly.  Figuring this CD couldn't be much worse, I dished out 15 bills and was shocked at the lack of feeling that went into this CD.  Only one catchy song (Rollin') and the rest was just rants and profanity.  Not what I was looking for in the first place.
6304675348|5.0|Considering I'm a total wuss when it comes to scary movies, it really is true when I say this is a great movie. It has laughter, sadness, and many moments of utter terror (for me!). I don't recommend the others in the trilogy, but the first is a really excellent movie.
B00004TRD8|4.0|The movie is in HQ for the picture, but for the sound is not clear
0767836251|5.0|My favorite part of the movie is Reese Witherspoon. She is my favorite actress, and was great in this movie. Ryan Phillippe is not only really cute, but a great actor. The entire movie is really entertaining, but I must admit I would change the ending.
B00003CX8J|5.0|An avid reader of comics for quite a while in my youth.  the X-Men was one of the titles I rabidly awaited every month.  When rumors started circulating that they were going to make a movie of the comic, I was a bit disappointed.<br />     Films from comics have not done well in the past, look at the film for &quot;The Punisher&quot;.  Though the casting was fairly good for that one, it was not as good as it could have been.  Plus the fact that it was a character that was hard to like.  There have been a few more in recent years also that though they were pretty to watch for the special effects, they were hard to watch for the lack of story.<br />     Picture my amazement when I heard that Bryan Singer would direct the film.  Bryan Singer from &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, and &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;.  How was he going to make the move from gritty realism to that of a comic book world?<br />     He didn't have to!  As hard as it is for me to beleive, Bryan made a gritty, realistic, comic book movie, and it is great.  With a little help from the casting , and CGI departments, he made an exceptional film.<br />     Now we come to the point in the interview where comic fans may be disappointed.  The film does not follow any storyline from the comics, so don't get this expecting &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; or some other story.  It is totally new.  Don't get me wrong, there are elements from throughout several arcs, but not enough to say that it is any one particular one.<br />     Still, any movie with a short, mean Canadian with claws that come out of his arms with a &quot;SNIKT&quot; sound can't be bad.  Buy it yourself and see.
B00003CXE6|5.0|The movie is pure entertainment with strong actors, mesmerizing music,  and stunning special effects.  There is no weak part of this movie.  The ending is very moving and makes you realize that while seeing this film, you would eagerly follow Russell Crowe, as Maximus, through Hell to get to the Elysian fields.  Maximus is a man among men in this Blockbuster epic that is the best movie since Ben Hur.  A very stong candidate come Oscar Award time.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is another historical revenge movie.  But this one, is the top of the pile.  Russelll Crowe is excellent as Maximus.  He is physical enough to be believable.  The special effects rival any of George Lucas film.  And this one is directed by the god of all directors Ridley Scott.<br />     The level of attention to detail is amazing.  And the special second disk in the set has several very interesting documentaries.  I'd say the cut footage included is not too important, but good to be included.<br />     I saw this one at the theatres and had to have it anyway, special features or not, but it doesn't hurt to through them in.  Excellent film with an excellent cast.
0375500901|5.0|If you liked Silva's previous novels run down to the store and pick this one up.  Be prepared to curl up on your couch and spend the rest of the day reading this book.  <br />If you have never read Silva then this novel is a good place to start.  In my opinion he is the best when it comes to international thrillers.  Great characters, storyline and seamless writing.   An easy read that will have you yearning for more.
6304493681|5.0|Whatever you may say about anime.  That it's for kids, or geeks.  This film is one of the greatest of all action films.  The perfect blending of computer and human art.  Unlike many anime films, the voice talent on this one actually works in the dubbed version.  So if you aren't into reading your films, this anime is for you.      The dark imagery of the future is comparable to that of Blade Runner, so if has that going for it.  And the idea of hacking into someone's brain is as imaginative as any story hook in recent memory.      Anime has come a long way in the past few years.  Hollywood has taken notice.  This is one of the films that made them do it. Go buy it, you won't be disappointed.
158234082X|2.0|Bourdain's account of his life as a chef is too long by half. The best parts of the book--his amusing revelations about where  restaurant leftovers end up and why NOT to order the special--appeared in The New Yorker. Save money by finding the back issue and reading him there.The rest of the book, Bourdain's autobiography, is an unsavory casserole of narcissism and some not terribly convincing self loathing, spiced with so many boring references to scoring drugs that, by the end, I found myself skimming rather than reading. There are a number of typos, and the book has a manic, disorganized quality that presumably reflects the author's personality but, more likely, suggests that it was rushed into print. Bourdain's prose resembles, well, a buffet table: a few decent things but an awful lot of chicken chow mein and seafood Newburg.
B00003Q43A|5.0|This is one of those movies you go and see on a hot summer afternoon.  You go to get out of the heat and into the cool air conditioning of the theatre.  There is alot of hype about the movie, so you go expecting eye-candy.<br />     That is what you get!  And alot of it.  The special effects of this movie are spectacular.  Amazing.<br />     The special edition DVD is almost as good as seeing it in the theatre.  The added features of the DVD are great too.  A new ending is included on the bonus disk, I won't ruin it for you, but it is great.  The behind the scenes stuff is good too.<br />     One thing I would have never believed though is that Will Smith is almost beleivable as a hot-shot pilot, and Bill Pullman, yes the guy from Spaceballs, pulls off being the President.  Get that movie and watch them right after another.  Tell me that you would have beleived it.
0767853636|5.0|Whenever I recall childhood, I remember watching this over and over with my brother, singing all the songs and loving all the characters! I don't know how the amazon review could be so harsh-this movie is adorble and I still love it today. Albert Finney was wonderful! I felt the 1999 version was very inferior!
0684853523|5.0|Steven King does a great job in On Writing of illustrating the most important part of the craft that every young writer should remember.  Writers write.  If you are not writing, and not writing every day, then you are not going to improve your skills.   Also King's attention to an often overlooked part of the craft, reading, is something that I've found lacking in most of the books on writing that I have read.  If you're not reading and you're not writing then you can't be a writer, and this book does a great job of hammering these points home. A great book and a worthy read (Especially the audio version).

B00003CXE7|4.0|This is too good of a movie to view on half of the screen.  What's up with this widescreen format.  Why is it being stuffed down the viewers throats.  DVD formatting is such a great advancement in audio and video quality, why can't it be formatted for fullscreen TV viewing
B000050IMJ|5.0|Wow, a great movie, loud noises, big bangs, hot cars, yes it does sound like one the cheesy, plotless, hollywood action flick. guess what, it is. I loved this movie, i really loved it, i am a car freak and can't seem to be able to look at the shelby enough times. This movie has no plot, no deep inner meaning, and definitely no oscar winning acting, its great because it does what its supposed to do to perfection, entertain. I reccommend this movie to anyone and everyone with one caution, prepare yourself for a mindnumbing waste of a few hours, Its great hahaha
B00003CXE7|3.0|I received this movie as a present having never seen it in the theatre.  I'm both disappointed and glad that I didn't spend the money.  Essentially it's the same kind of plot as Braveheart, but set in the Roman Empire.  While it is visually and musically stunning, the movie is extremely brutal.  It's major flaw was the weakness of the plot and the lack of character development of some of the players, despite some great acting.  It's worth renting, particularly if you have a really large screen tv, but I don't think that your collection will be lacking if you leave this off of your buy list.  If it does well in the Oscar hunt, it will only serve to prove the weakness of this year's collection of movies.
B0000024IE|5.0|But it is when you dial it and it's not a real emergency. I, for once, have to admit I remember hearing this song and laughing because I thought the message was true. NOT! I DID dial 911 like, three years ago, and it wasn't even a real emergency. Don't make the same mistake.
B00004UEDQ|3.0|You won't want to go into rehab after you see this movie. The girl next door is a boozer and she breaks her sister's heart. She learns that her friends are her fatal flaw and her character is all that can save her. I've never been to rehab but I know the power of faith and the value of relationships with quality people. Weak people tend to become the kind of people they hang around with. This movie trys to say that change can only come from within if it is supported externally.  It's too bad they don't get into the value of character.
B00000J7J4|3.0|....including my mother, who loves Santana, I REALLY wanted to like this album because of the eight Grammy Awards it won and the fact that it dethroned Michael Jackson's Thriller as history's most popular album. Okay, so it deserves a tie with the latter. And Santana sold out with this MTV-fired stuff, particularly when you saw (and heard) &quot;Maria Maria&quot; and &quot;Smooth&quot; (everyone knows THAT song) garnering a whole bunch of air/radio play here in America. Dethroning Jackson once and for all also helped Santana gain the title of &quot;new king of the world.&quot; So what? Does it make Supernatural the most special album out there? There are a NUMBER of albums in this world that don't win any music awards and yet are as good as this. Similarly, it used to be (and still is) that albums that win Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards are those by people who wrote their own songs. In THIS case, I didn't see Carlos Santana having written majority of the songs on this album. Don't you agree?
B00004ZAV3|4.0|For those of you who are thinking about buying this mish-mash of pretty tunes because you want to start exploring the Beatles, spend your money instead on one of their &quot;Big Five&quot; albums (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, White Album, Abbey Road).  The arrangement of these singles, while not inaccurate in depicting their development, does NOT include their best work (to leave out &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; especially is unforgivable), and it gives the listener barely any clue as to why the Beatles were among the greatest musical artists:  their craftsmanship in their ALBUMS.  Any of the albums listed above is a FAR greater collection of songs than the &quot;1&quot; artifice.  Trust me, you will gain a far greater--and more immediate--sense of appreciation for the Beatles' music with one of their REAL albums.
B00003CX97|5.0|It got 7 Oscars in 1957. It is based on a real story. The song glues to your mind. And the 2 set DVD has nice extras that add to your admiration of this title. It is not the state of the art in restoration terms, but it won't let you down, abolutely. The story is well above any scratch you might see. It makes the battle between two cultures greater than any battle on the war.
B0000203YT|4.0|I thought this movie was very entertaining.  It was witty, well-written and beautifully played by a talented cast.
B00003CX8J|5.0|This DVD is very well done. The art direction, etc is very good, adds to the atmosphere of the movie. I expected a bit more on the extras field. Maybe they're saving this for a future &quot;Special Edition&quot;. Anyway, the box is amazing, the menus very well done and the movie entertaining by itself. The fight sequence on the Statue of Liberty is electrifying.
B00004SCX6|4.0|well there are a few songs on the cd that i can relate to because i got this cd just a few days before this guy broke up with me. the song stronger made me think that i should just get over him and move on. there are a few other songs that i like on the cd but the rest aren't what i would call grammy material.
B000002UV9|5.0|Albums don't get much better than this. I've heard greatest hits compilations that pale in comparison. Thought provoking lyrics blend extremely well with Geoff's dynamic style. Combined with hard hitting riffs puts Empire my top ten list of greatest albums.
6305252521|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies in recent history.  Jim Carrey here joins Robin Williams (&quot;Dead Poets Society,&quot; etc.) and Michael Keaton (&quot;Batman,&quot;  &quot;Pacific Heights,&quot; etc.), to be counted among the few comic actors who have managed a foray into the world of drama with spectacular success...  The basic idea of this film, as in all likelihood whoever is reading this already knows, is that Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man whose entire life has been surreptitiously filmed, and made into a sort of global media cult...  He is almost completely unaware of this, although now and then he has gotten an inkling that something's up.  Everything about this movie is perfect -- even Truman's name is a perfect mix -- &quot;True Man&quot;, which is what he is finally becoming, mixed with &quot;Burbank&quot;, the home of the phoniest people alive, the Hollywood establishment.  <br />I think one of the most important parts of this film is that Truman is turning 30 years old.  There is something about that age that, in my experience, really does involve a reassessment of all kinds of things in one's life.   There is a questioning that goes on, as well as a sort of heightened awareness of the social games around you that are really traps, if you think about them.  Some of them are traps that are probably worth fighting to stay locked up in, but now I'm revealing my bourgeois bias.  Be that as it may, given the general theme of becoming aware of perhaps living in some kind of fool's paradise --  if the main character of this movie were 16 years old, the movie would probably resemble &quot;Pump Up the Volume.&quot;  If the main character were 23, the movie might resemble &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  But the kind of awakening that happens in the early 30s is what's being captured here, and the director Peter Weir does everything perfectly.<br />A couple things I wanted to say -- Noah Emmerich is terrific as the buddy, Marlon, who shows up with a six packat crisis moments, to keep Truman's brain anaesthetized.  Noah seems to get typecast a little in the &quot;buddy&quot; role, he played a similar part in &quot;Beautiful Girls.&quot;  He does have a good look for that kind of role.  Oh well, I guess it's a living...  I also wanted to say that while it's easy to identify with Truman, breaking free of the lies that have bound his mind, I think anyone watching this should also ask themselves whether they've ever played the part of Cristoph, the director-overseer of the artificial world who keeps lying to Truman, to make Truman's &quot;happiness&quot; his (Cristoph's, not Truman's) responsibility.  I have done this in my life.  Looking at this movie, I identify at least as strongly with Cristoph as with Truman.  Probably even more.  This is the kind of mentality which could lead to someone becoming a mental abuser of a partner in any relationship -- romantic, familial, workplace, or what have you...  The killer storm that Cristoph invokes at the end, especially, reminded me of the kind of tantrum any controlling person might throw, if they could, to keep another human being under their thumb...  Cristoph made his decision to keep lying forever to the person who made his own &quot;happiness&quot; possible.  If anyone reading this is involved in any symbolically similar behavior, take a cue from this movie and change your ways while there's still time, and set the Truman in your life, whoever it is, free.  Just a thought.<br />Fox Mulder, on the &quot;X-Files&quot; once famously mentioned that &quot;a choice given to many men is the choice between being a slave in heaven, or a master in hell.&quot;  The ending of this movie opens up the prospect of an exciting third possibility -- to be oneself, neither master nor slave, but a free being.  As long as you maintain a kind, gentle heart, which Truman clearly does, everyone should have that right.  This movie rules.  Absolutely worth owning.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Calling this album music is a total insult to many talented artists today!  The lyrics is horrible (I mean why use the f word every second in Hot Dog, whining about every single thing.  He's obviously 30-something, so he wouldn't know what's it like to be a teen of the year 2000-1.  His attempts to mock Trent Reznor of NIN is obviously futile through-out the album), about as bad as their second album, &quot;Significant Other&quot;.  The guitars, drums, electronics, and bass is highly boring, too.  Not only that, why Fred Durst flaks many artists and bands such as Creed, Marilyn Manson (IMHO, a great philosopher and mis-interpreted genius.), Alanis Morsiette and many others?  Is he jealous of them or maybe he is a school-yard bully so he can get attention?  Speaking of Fred Durst, his vocals sucks.  His voice is about as horrible as a drugged up hyena.  Using guest artists and putting &quot;Take A Look Around&quot; cannot save this failed album from a failed band.  Avoid this album, along with many today's talentless nu-metal bands, such as Linkin Park, Papa Roach, and Taproot.  If you want good nu-metal albums, get albums from Rage Against The Machine or One Minute Silence, instead.  You want real and true-to-honest artists that doesn't cash in attention and money?  Get albums from Tool, Slayer, Pitchshifter, Ministry, Fear Factory, Meshuggah, Metallica (old stuff), Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Misery Loves Co., Machine Head, Revolting Cocks, Nothingface, Skinlab, Refused, Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, Project Pitchfork, Pig, NIN, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, The Eagles, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Santana, Sophie B. Hawkins, Katie Price, Sarah McLaughlin, Beethoven, Mozart, and any other artists that is much better than this poor excuse of a band.<br />BTW, I think the thing between Christina Augilera and Fred Durst is rather disturbing.  Combining both of their mockery of music in MTV awards is scary.  Please, avoid garbage pop music and many hopeless nu-metal bands.Image isn't everything, you know?
0767802659|3.0|The hero is in love with the popular girl at school. The popular girl is in love with some other hunk. The tomboy is in love with the hero. The hero wouldn't realize that the tomboy is a babe if she stripped naked and jumped on him. The popular girl breaks the hero's heart. I'm talking about Starship Troopers, but I could just as easily be discussing about Teen Wolf, Better Off Dead or She's All That. The Love Square. Just in case a triangle isn't challenging enough.<br />There's a hapless school boy who no one really expects to amount to anything.  He doesn't know what he wants out of life, but he knows there has to be something more. He joins an elite group of soldiers and through a series of misadventures he saves the world and becomes the hero of he silver screen. I'm talking about Starship Troopers, but I could just as easily discussing Star  Wars, Stripes or the Matrix. Join the Armed forces, we'll make a man of you or you'll die trying.<br />There's a word for this sort of thing. The word is cliché. But there's nothing wrong with that. Plots become cliché because they are used over and over again. Plots are used over and again because people like them. There's nothing new in Starship Troopers, but it does a wonderful job of rehashing old plots in a new story. Frankly, the first twenty minutes or so are really boring, but once the story gets rolling, its a lot of fun.<br />The disc itself is a poster child for special features. Its presented only in Widescreen format, because the true videophile doesn't care about Pan &amp; Scan anyway, and it has tons of extra footage. The problem is, all of the special features (except for the Filmmaker's Commentary) are on the second side of the disk. This isn't a major problem, since its easy enough to flip the disc over, but it means you have to get up and flip the disc over to see the outtakes, instead of being able to just flip to them after the film is over. I like to think that the studio is just trying to keep me from being lazy.
B000000WA4|5.0|I know most of you probably think I am some hardcore, metal head, but that is not neccesarily the truth. I will let it be known that I spent the better part of last week crying in my bed. Why you ask? The Smashing Pumpkins are no more. Billy I love you. I mean they are the sound of the generation. I have all of their albums and a a tatoo on my arm that pays homage to those GODS. Yeah, so what if I am a groopie? I have a love. A love for the Smashing Pumpkins. Days that I would have nobody to turn to, I would listen to Billy's words, and suddenly everything would be O.K. There was this one time, when I lost my pet rock, and I thought the whole world was going to hell. I didn't eat. I didn't sleep. All I did was cut myself with a razor blade as punishment for my stupidity. Well, once I gathered whatever sanity I had remaining, I went to the CD player and put on The Pumpkins. Man, there was something about them. Something bold and fresh. The Pumpkins are the soundtrack to my life.
6304936303|4.0|There are two types of movies in this world. Movies that are for guys and movies that aren't. The Last Boy Scout definitely fits in the former category. It's as though producer, Joel Silver, and screenwriter, Shane Black said &quot;Let's make a movie that red-blooded American males age 18-34 will enjoy. We'll need some babes, some comedy, a couple big name action stars, a good explosion budget, and what the hell, let's throw in some football.&quot;<br />This isn't a film that is going to go down in history as ground breaking. Bruce Willis is more exciting in Die Hard. Damon Wayans is funnier in Blankman. Lethal Weapon (also by Black and Silver) is a better action movie. And Halle Berry is only actually in about three scenes. But this is kind of a Jack-of-all trades movie. It's one of those action/comedy classics that you add to your video library on the shelf right next to Big Trouble in Little China.<br />The DVD features are nothing special. All the standard bells and whistles are there (multiple soundtracks, multiple sub-titles, scene access, widescreen and pan &amp; scan versions). Special features include the film's trailer, as well as trailers for several other films. There's no director's commentary, behind the scenes footage, cast interviews or cut scenes, but there are a few rather informative productions notes. This isn't a disc you buy for features though. This is definitely a film you buy to watch.<br />All in all, it's a very fun movie. It won't stick out as an all time classic in any genre, but it is a fun flick for a weekend afternoon. There are several cameos by football personalities, constant witty one-liners, bitter scum-of-the-earth good guys and gentlemanly if effeminate bad guys. It's an action movie that you can watch with your girlfriend (well your tolerant girlfriend) just as easily as you can with your old college buddies.
B00003CX6P|3.0|Jude Law totally steals the show in this thriller as Dickie Greenleaf, an American playboy living it up in Italy. His animal energy flies off the screen and his demise is way too early, leaving the rest of the film gasping in his shadow. Damon and Paltrow add good support and the story is always watchable, but the film completely belongs to Law. A must for armchair travellers, as the characters travel from Naples to Rome to San Remo to Vence.
B000002L9J|5.0|As far as i'm concerned &quot;There is a Light that Never Goes Out&quot; is THEE best song by the Smiths. It wasn't even the reason why i bought this record. But now it's the reason why this cd is still one of my favorites. Such an amazing song. Lyrics are genius, and the strings are beautiful. It's really quite sad that it wasn't untill The Smiths were long gone that i realized how brilliant they were.
6300215741|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Hitchcock fan and I like Grace Kelly and Cary Grant. But somehow the mystery in the film didn't intrigue me and I found lots of it boring and pretentious. Not that it's a complete waste. Grace Kelly is as always lovely to look at, and the French riviera is stunning. But the story and acting certainly don't linger in the mind. I give it 3 stars for the leads and scenery. One last observation: it is chilling to see Kelly driving the same winding roads in Monaco where she would meet her death years later.
B00003CXDG|2.0|Did this movie really tell much of a story? Does it remind anyone of the old show?    The first one from 1996 was one of the more suspenseful movies of the 90s, and the second one is ridiculously stupid.    What was with this face mask garbage? Nobody was anybody. Everybody had someone elses' face on and spoke in their voice. It got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. It ruined the movie. It was so unrealistic. A few of the action sequences were good at the end, but the first hour and a half is so boring and undeveloping, nothing can save it.   THE MUSIC WAS BAD.
B000002N3N|5.0|This music is pure joy. Every track is a masterpiece. If you don't adore Enya after hearing this, you should see a doctor.

0792839625|1.0|One of the cheesiest musicals I have ever seen. A bunch of untalented unknown actors play dancers competing in an important audition. The songs are abysmal and many moments are groan-worthy. You will find yourself laughing at scenes that are unintentionally funny.
B000002VTE|4.0|With Ladies &amp; Gentlemen... Spiritualized put out a monumental record sporting collaborations with tens of musicians ranging from Dr. John (which plays the piano if I remenber well on one track) to the London Community gospel choir. Spiritualited formed from the ashes of Spacemen 3 and they kept the very same trademark sound: &quot;hypnotic headphone symphonies&quot; as someone called them which means basically that they're into  neo-psychedelia. Someone pointed out that the record tends to get a bit monotonous but that's just because of its being  psychedelic! How would you reach the entrancement otherwise ? ;-) Don't mind those fools and buy it! I guess it's a bit like taking drugs, only you don't have the unpleasant backwards (but they too are addictive...)
B00003CX95|4.0|For all the excessive violence, this is a compelling film. Not really for the acting but the inspiring story in itself. Sometimes unbearably sad.
B00000K28G|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've bought in a long time!  To say this CD is anything less than amazing is wrong.  This CD reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd in a lot of respects; it's trippy, it's mellow, and there are a lot of fantastic acoustic parts throughout the entire CD.  Vincent has got one of the most melancholy voices I've ever heard.  This is a depressing, but very moving CD.  It's very atmospheric.  If you're into Pink Floyd, check this one out.  If you're into atmospheric, mellow metal, check this one out.  My favorite songs are Deep, Forgotten Hopes, Make It Right (F.F.S.), One Last Goodbye, Judgement, and Don't Look Too Far.  The only song I don't really care for is Parisienne Moonlight (it just doesn't sound right to me).  Buy this CD and be glad you did.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is a real winner. First, you have a powerhouse orchestra under the capable baton of Mehta. THEN! We have Pavarotti in one of his first heavy roles. It is a success on every level and I don't just mean Nessun dorma either. <br />Joan Sutherland is a miracle here. Turandot is one of the heaviest roles for sopranos, and Sutherland is most famous for bel canto coloratura roles and that's why she is such a fabulous surprise. One wishes she had recorded more of the verismo repertoire, like Gioconda. <br />Last but not least, Caballe creates a truly believable character in Liu. Her suicide broke my heart. Don't waste time with other Turandots. This is the best ever.
0446315028|3.0|I enjoy reading mysteries so that I can be surprised by the characters' actions or motives.  This novel has very few surprises.  Yet, because PD James is such an excellent writer, I enjoyed the novel because of the detective.  His thoughts were interesting and surprising.  I wish the action had been too.
B000002MY3|5.0|The chick can't sing really, but who cares with such great songs? All kinds of emotion is expressed in her music and I can truly say that it's an original sound. Her whiny voice may sometimes grate on the ear but once you understand it's an interpretive technique, you get used to it. At certain times you find yourself mirroring emotions: overwhelming rage, longing, sudden optimism. Remarkable.
0312853254|5.0|First off, it seems many who have read Ender's Game and  read other books by Orson seem disappointed. Well, to me, it seems they are setting themselves up for disappointment. What many people do is immediately compare it to Ender's Game! This book as well as many others, sorry to say, is nothing like Ender's Game. So I believe by reading a book by Orson we should not be trying to expect the same eagerness as we did in Ender's Game and set ourselves up for disappointment.<br />Orson begans this story 3,000 years after where Ender's Game left off. The setting is on the planet of Lusitania, where another species called the &quot;piggies&quot; exist. The Starways Congress tries in every right to preserve their habitat and natural course of history for the &quot;piggies&quot;. Yet, people are killed, and Ender is called to speak for the dead. This is where the story unfolds........<br />In this book, Ender is looking for redemption for the genocide of the buggers, as well in the meantime, help a family grow together and solve the mystery of the killings. Though, with less action, this book is  more emotional than Ender's Game. The book touches more on moral issues, and we get to know more of Ender. In my opinion, this book is a great story and sequel and if you truly enjoyed Ender's Game, you should NEVER pass out on this one.
B00003CWL6|3.0|I think this film was overappreciated. Yes, some parts were original, nicely shot, yes, there was some good acting, but darl comedies have been better filmed before, like &quot;Happiness&quot; for example. And I always thought Bening's performance was overrated. I think she's a competent actress but I've seen her to better effect elsewhere. However this is not entirely her fault, for I feel her role was underwritten and one dimensional. Spacey is adequate, I guess. I don't know, it just didn't bowl me over. Darn depressing, too.
B00000F169|3.0|Dark Star has become something of a cult classic to sci-fi fans and it's easy to see why.  It features the early work of several people (Dan O'Bannon and John Carpenter) who would later make signifant contributions to the genre.  It also has the kind of skewed humor that often is a factor in achieving cult status.  Yes, the effects are fairly cheesy and the acting and story are often lame, but somehow Dark Star rises above all that to be enjoyable in its own way.  The DVD does a good job of presenting a movie that didn't look all that great in the theater.  This was, as others have commented, originally a student film that was expanded and distributed in theaters.  The DVD allows the viewer to see two versions of the movie, the theatrical release and a 'creators' cut that removes most of the expansion material and returns the film to something closer to its student film form.  Frankly, I thought the expanded, theatrical version was superior to the special cut.  The added scenes did give more depth to the story and characters, and they need it.  This movie will not appeal to everyone, but I think any serious fan of the genre should consider having it in their library.
B00004Y7SF|2.0|Because I am such a big fan of Christina Aguilera, I was sorely disappointed to get this album, listen to it, and wish that I hadn't.  In the worse case of over-emoting since Mariah Carey shot onto the scene, Aguilera sings every word of every song and manages to add extra syllables to each.  The song set isn't particularly original either. Of course, there can't be a pop album(or it seems one of any genre)released these days without a Diane Warren tune, the selection here being 'These Are Special Times', recorded a few years back by Celine Dion. It's a typical Warren song, meaning it's just like the hundreds of other songs she's written--contrived and utterly sappy.  The truly sad thing about this project is that Aguilera is very talented, but she seems to be under the impression that someone out there thinks that she can't sing, and is trying to prove them wrong.  What she needs to realize is that everyone knows she can sing--next time maybe she'll add a little nuance and subtlety to the proceedings, and we might just get a far better record for it.
B00004XONN|5.0|The thing that makes Radiohead so great is that they change with each album. If this record sounded like OK I would have been a bit saddened, even though I think OKC is the best record of the decade. Kid A keeps things fresh. It keeps things kinetic. And that's how I like my music. A static music scene is a bad one, and Radiohead are obviously trying to keep things moving forward. The record is great...the best of the year, probably. You should buy it. I'm sure if you're a music lover you'll love Kid A.
0804106304|4.0|Having just finished the Joy Luck Club it is a wonderful series of beautifully described stories of hope against hope, attempting to find some happiness and luck amidst the tragedy. However, apart from seeing how the book works so well for so many different readers whether appreciating the tragedy of the situation or the irony of losing one culture amidst the hope of retaining it in pursuit of a new life in a new one. Despite the undeniably harsh and mostly unavoidable 'fate' and obligation which the mothers of this story went through there is an even deeper level of this story which I am left wondering if the author herself actually understands the irony of, or whether she simply tells it as she sees it not even knowing the greatest irony of all which has been passed down to her from one generation to the next and which this generation lives out to the full - perhaps reflecting so much of the author's own ability or inability to see through the haze to what has really been shown. Particularly towards the end of the book, what really comes across strongly - beyond the metaphors and symbolism heaped layer upon layer throughout the story - is the sense that the characters do not really know, and scarcely wish to admit, their own failings. The mothers who, when they had a real choice in life, married not for love but for benefit both earlier and then later on coming to America. Others who tricked their way into people's affections for their own benefit, never mentioning that they cared for their new partner instead merely wondering why, on later reflection, they ever choose that partner - loyal and kind and supportive as he may be - then remembering they never really made that choice at all and that it was their friend in fact who told them, or that they convinced themselves that it was what 'should' happen even though there was no obligation to make that choice thus fulfilling their own prophecy and justifying it all with superstition - real or imagined. How it makesme wonder, amidst all of this double talk (e.g. the mother saying she doesn't have tiger eyes but then saying that she does and that it's merely her daughter who cannot see them, or the mother who not merely is unconcerned during the planning, as to whether she has a baby boy or baby girl in the US for the purpose of tricking her way to American citizenship but who can laugh at the prospect that it wouldn't even matter which it is as 'neither will learn to look after them in their old age'. This is the real tragedy of these stories. Not merely the past lives and the unfulfilled hope for the future but the fact that on looking for that great future for themselves and their children, they are sowing the seeds of their own all too certain downfall amidst a sea of loveless marriages and where even the children are born so that the mother can 'change her circumstances' and become an American citizen. Sure there's a justification for it but that belies the consequences which these actions create; the seeds of future loveless, meaningless relationships. None of the characters express their deep love or passion for one another, merely obligation, distrust or resentment of one another....and no wonder when they have no reason to believe they were conceived for love and joy rather than merely for function. There is also a lot of confusion in the story - and perhaps also the mind of the author, almost as if she does not know whether she feels truly Chinese but just appearing to be American on the surface or whether in fact she's truly American with just a tiny voice inside her wishing she were truly Chinese. The clever way in which these tales have been told conceals the fact that they are so riddled with self-justification - the characters having just revealed a truth but then change their story in the vain hope that their daughters will not grow up to be like them, lacking in hope and meaning and without knowing where they're truly going. As for the daughters themselves, freed from the constraints of their past they become complacent and wasteful, heaping shallow short term valuelessness on top of a deep rooted sense of not knowing what a true relationship really is, not knowing what they want from their marriages and seeming entirely 'lost' wondering even why they ever entered them in the first place. The minimal parts which these men are allowed show them yet to be giving, sharing, easily compromising and yes - with one exception - totally loyal as well! Shame that they seem to be shortchanged, being picked up and discarded through the women's inability to know where they are themselves going. Mostly though the multitude of male characters are mentioned but little more, except for those who featured strongly in the mothers' pasts - which in these women's tales means the nastier ones equating to the bitterness and tragedy of their former lives. The many others: brothers, fathers, husbands and friends are all there and perhaps at times actually appreciated a little but never truly valued and almost never truly loved. In the pursuit of their own change of circumstances - at whatever cost to themselves - these women have laid the foundation for the loss of everything they truly valued and much of the hope and real love that their children could have had. As one reviewer has already mentioned, the irony of losing their culture despite expecting their daugthers to follow it devoutly is no better shown than at the front of section one where the Swan's feather - a symbol of hope and thereby an embodied symbol of all the metaphors of Chinese culture - cannot be truly understood by their daughters until such time as the mothers can explain it in to them in their new tongue, by which time they will have grown so much apart and have so little understanding of where their mothers really came from that all true meaning of the culture and symbolism will have been lost in the 'translation' to a new culture and language. After all how can the daughters understand something which they have nothing to relate it to - if indeed it ever could have been described in terms of such a different language and culture.
6305095566|5.0|Why is it that, although a modern day horror movie can cost millions of dollars and star all the talented young actors of our day and age, they still can't compare to the originals? Evil Dead is a classic, and should always be hailed in the same breath as Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It was the ultimate low budget thriller, with tons of gore and images you could only throw into a movie like this (IE the tree raping scene?). But it's moved a step above that by the talented direction and knack for horror of Sam Raimi and the energetic and off-the-wall acting of Bruce Campbell. It spawned two sequels (which were both, in their own ways, as good as the original, which is quite an oddity in the movie world), and has developed into a cult classic all over the world. Why do think that over 180 people stopped to review this movie on Amazon? Once you've seen it, for better or worse, it'll stick with you. Not for the weak of heart, but horror/cult lovers will find this right up their alley. The ultimate of cult films.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD is fantastic! They compiled all the Beatles best songs onto 1 compact disc. It includes my favorites: Day Tripper, Hello-Goodbye, and the Ballad of John &amp; Yoko. I highly recommend you buying this classic. It is worth every red cent.
6303234844|5.0|A friend of mine told me I had to see  this video because he knew how much of a music fan I was. I didn't really  know too much of peter gabriel's stuff-- just his hits from the eighties. Then, when I saw this video, I was instantly blown away by Peter's heartfelt and soulful performance! He captivated me! I quickly became a PG fan from this video! The songs are beautiful. I loved how he could be so playful at one point-- such as his dancing during Shaking the Tree (which I rewound over and over again because he  was simply so adorable and loveable!), and at another point he could be so serious and emotional, such as during Blood of Eden, and Digging in the Dirt). He also was simply sexy during Steam and Sledgehammer. YOU MUST PICK this UP!!  I couldnt stop watching it for weeks after I picked it up! After you buy this, get your hands on the cd to go along with it! Peter is so wonderful.
B000000OTY|5.0|You MUST buy the video which accompanies this cd.  It will bring this cd much more to life. The way Peter Gabriel moves, dances-- his expressions of joy and sadness are simply priceless. I originally saw the video, then HAD to attain the cd.  So, BUY THE VIDEO!!  Peter Gabriel is not only a loving, expressive soul, but he can be downright sexy and mesmorizing too! And this can be captured SO MUCH more when you SEE him perform these songs!  I LOVED the dancing sequence in &quot;Shaking the Tree&quot;!  I was so impressed with the way he can move! And boy ladies, can he move! He's so cute and loveable:)
B0000026NC|1.0|The Great Gig song is in the concert VHS tape version but it is left out of this cd. Why? To watch the VHS version of this cd- The Great Gig in the Sky is a very powerful, emotionally moving experience and in my opinion the best part of this whole concert. It was left out of the cd and I resent that. I've always been Floyd through and though but I regret buying this cd.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Halfway through the film I knew I wanted to buy the record.  The song that did it for me was the winsome and gorgeous &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot;.  Sometimes I've bought soundtracks and been disappointed, because they leave out some tracks that were in the film, or the songs just don't stand up well on their own.  That's not the case here.  All the music from the movie is here, in the order it appeared in the film.  And each track is sheer joy - even the sorrowful ones.<br />One thing that's really great about the film and the soundtrack is that the music is an integral part of the film.  This isn't one of those soundtracks where the film producers arbitrarily put in background music just to sell records.  The music comments on and advances the plot and is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the film.  Go and see the movie - it's hiliarious - then take the soundtrack home and enjoy sweet harmonies and jangling banjos.
B0000541WR|5.0|I read the screenplay before I saw the film, which isn't bad, but in this instance, it is. See the movie, THEN read the screenplay. So, for me, the thrill was so to say &quot;gone&quot;. But there was still much left to enjoy. <br />This movie starts off showing three instances of chance, or coincidences in life. Which is basically the whole movie. Someone might ask me, &quot;Well why'd they have to take three hours to play it out.&quot; Because, the beauty of it all is hidden within the film. The acting, the cinematography, the music, everything. I can't say much about this movie because I'm still not sure how I exactly feel about it. I'm going to have to view it a few more times. It's a journey, that's what this film is. A cinematic journey of life, love, death, family, sex, drugs, and everything else. Stuff happens...that's what this movie shows. Stuff hapens...and that's life.
B00003W8NM|5.0|&quot;It is only when you give up everything are you able to do anything.&quot;  Brilliant words that directly address everything our society today deals with.  With the media and advertisements revolving around us every single day, this movie presents the possibility of want versus need.  Then delving deeper past that, it breaks down the entire category of &quot;want,&quot; and what &quot;want&quot; even is.  What is truly necessary in life, and to get rid of what isn't.  The movie deals with fighting, but is not nearly as gory or disgusting as any war movie out there.  It depicts fighting as that which is primal and of life, not things like your Brooks Brothers suit, or Armani shoes or whatnot.  &quot;How do you know who you are if you've never even been in a fight?&quot;  To test your physical limitations and your actual mortality other than this perspective of who you should be as so friendly presented to you from the media and what deems us as viewable in society's eye.  It is a great movie, but can be dangerous for any socialites out there, it might make them think critically about their lives.
0441172717|5.0|I have to admit that this is not a proper review of the book Dune, but actually more of a review of the mini series. The other reviewers have done well in convincing me that I should buy the first book, but it was actually the mini series that first provoked me. This is not the movie I am talking about, this is the mini series of 3 parts. Each one is more or less feature length. The movie was not very good and friends of mine assure me that it was a  complete failure in capturing the book's mystical fantasy and amazing vision. When I saw the mini series of Dune I was amazed. My friends who have read the book say that it is a very good representation of the story, but as with any re-make or television adaption there will be parts you dislike or parts that you wish were included. Watch it! It is great! I think it's better than any Star Wars episode I have seen to date. That's why I knew I had to find the book, because if the TV version was that good, the book had to be out of this world. Muah'dib, the Spice, worms, everything! If you don't like it...keep in mind that it was at least good enough to make me want to read the novel and all the other books in the series.
B0000399WI|5.0|I've watched this movie probably about 5 times, and I can never get sick of watching it.  Though based on a different time of life, it's strong themes can be seen and applied to our lives.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both perform in some of the greatest roles ever, and the duo create a chemistry that displays true friendship and trust.  Through their bond, issues other than those dealing directly with the penitentiary are addressed and made evident to the viewer an honest approach to life.  To sit through the movie is quite enjoyable, and never does it get slow at all.  In my humble opinion, as a college student and having first seen it in high school, it has only gotten better with time and it has indeed helped to shape my perception of the world.
0515127485|5.0|Robert Harris doesn't just give you mysteries, he tweaks the genre by adding his own &quot;what if&quot; historical twists.  This latest is a gem.  It begins somewhat slowly then the pace picks up until it reaches high speed in the frozen wastes of northern Russia.<br />His protagonist is far from the usual adventurer; he's Fluke Kelso, a cynical, down on his luck academic attending a symposium in present day Moscow.  The notorious Joe Stalin is, in a sense, the villain.  Soon after he arrives in Russia Kelso is presented with evidence of secret papers of Stalin.  From there he investigates a decades-old mystery.  Along the way he meets unusual characters including a scholarly prostitute, an over-eager reporter and some scary old-guard Russians.<br />The plot is more than a simple mystery.  Harris challenges you to imagine what will happen to the new Russia and what some of the forces were that shaped the old Soviet Union.<br />His characters, realistic descriptions of the Russian landscape in winter and the imaginative plot will keep you reading until the last sentence.
0316286443|5.0|Kevyn Aucion is a genious! I've only flipped through this book, but you would not believe what Kevyn can do with a box of makeup. The most amazing transformation I saw in his book was Calista Flockheart made to look like Audrey Hepburn. An amazing book!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD has all those great Beatles songs you hear on the radio.  Since I don't have any other Beatles CDs, this one is fantastic because it has all my favorites plus others that I don't remember.  It's peppy and fun to listen to (and even sing along with!) and hard to get tired of.  This CD is just great.  I suppose if you already have these songs on other CDs, you wouldn't need this one, but if you don't, it makes a good addition to your music collection.
B000002JS6|5.0|Being one of the many people who love new, thrashing, head-banging bands like Limp Bizkit and Rage, I have come to apprieciate the founders of our music. I've really gotten into awesome eighties bands, and I'm obsessed with BON JOVI and ACDC! Anyway, Back in Black is amazing, and if you've never heard it before, YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Not only did it go double platinum, but it has some great tunes about the good ol' rock 'n roll virtues of sex, booze, and rockin' on. This album has funny lyrics and some great guitar riffs, and the lead singer has one of the most distinguished and genuine voices in rock music. This is definately one of the most influential albums on today's modern hard rock music, so if you're a rocker, GET THIS CD! It is absolutely amazing.
B000002GHH|5.0|One of the great musical tragedies of the last two decades is that if you mention the name &quot;John Hiatt&quot; to most people, all you'll get in response is a blank stare.  Most people seem to have missed Hiatt, which is far beyond a shame, as he's one of the most talented songwriters of his generation.<br />Bring the Family is an unadulterated masterpiece, no ifs, ands, buts, or other varied conjunctions about it.  &quot;Memphis in the Meantime&quot; manages to have both humor and a great groove, &quot;Thing Called Love&quot; is a great song whether or not Bonnie Raitt is doing it, and if there's a person who doesn't choke up hearing &quot;Have a Little Faith In Me&quot; I wouldn't let children within a hundred feet of them.  It's one of the most touching songs I can even imagine.<br />Anyone not owning this one has a large hole in their musical collection.  A hole that should be very quickly repaired.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is my favorite film of 2000. I saw it three times in the cinema and watching it on DVD is just as satisfying. Plus the extra interviews and diary of the film is fun and interesting. It is long and it does at many times border on the sentimental, but it never falls over the edge. Really, it doesn't seem as long as the minute count indicates. There is so much happening and it keeps your interest perked to the point where the hours slip by without notice. It maintains a brilliant delicate balance between the characters interconnecting them in strange and moving ways. The music is what makes the movie because it connects all of the characters in one emotional movement. You are really told so little about them, but the poignancy of the script in conjunction with the emotional texture of the music weaves not just one but several penetrating emotional portraits. Aimee Mann's music is simply poetic.  Julianne Moore is one of the best American actresses of the shiny screen today and her performance is one that is complex and makes you feel tremendous sympathy for this woman who is so desperate. Tom Cruis' role is at the same time hilarious and moving. He pulls it off masterfully. Philip Baker Hall gives a great performance. Those who loved 'Boogie Nights' will love this film. My only criticism is that the story of &quot;the worm&quot; is not developed enough, but if you read the screenplay you will see that this story line is drawn more deeply. The story was cut out for time reasons even though it's still a long movie. But even so, the film has so much to offer you will definitely feel you've got your money's worth. It's a powerhouse.
0399146253|1.0|While I read and enjoyed Patrica Cronwell's other books, this one left me cold.  Kay has become so paranoid and self-involved that her life is no longer interesting, nor or the characters that surround her.  I couldn't bring myself to finish it -- I found it so bad -- and was sorry I bought it hard cover.  It's my last Patricia Cronwell purchase.
B00003CXDG|3.0|If you're looking for great action and...effects this film does it all. If you're looking for a deep plot and expect to be emotionally involved don't bother. I was entertained and that is sufficient for me for this type of film. But what I found really fascinating was the way in which an old Hitchcock plot was reworked in the script. It used many of the same plot points of my favorite Hitchcock film 'Notorious'. A woman of questionable moral standards is sent in a top-secret mission to use her charms with a criminal who happens to be an old intimate acquaintance. There is a car chase together to heighten the...tension between the government agent and the saucy heroine. There is a poignant scene at the racetrack. The woman falls ill by the villains hand and the hero must save her thus sealing their love. How interesting that Tom should be the new Cary Grant, but I guess it was inevitable.
B00003CX8J|5.0|one off the best films i've got
0312243022|5.0|This was written by a man who loves Woolf and if you love her writing like I do then you'll thoroughly enjoy this novel. The writing is poetically charmed with emotion and wit. While following the stories of these three different touching women you'll slowly become aware of Virginia's famous rooks circling above their heads threatening death and change, terror and peace, permanence and rebirth. Mr Cunningham tugs at a spiritual thread that runs through their lives. You can feel it with the sincerest sympathy. Not only do you get a compelling portrait of the way our perception of women have changed over the century, but you feel the dilemmas of life's uncertainties in all their horror and beauty.
B000003TA4|5.0|Everysong is good and it set the standerds for todays music, and yes it is grundge
B000000WA4|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins have created a masterpiece. Bold, eclectic, and stunning in its sheer scale, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is truly phenomenal. The album's hits, including &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;, and &quot;1979&quot;, are all excellent, but the album's greatness extends beyond just a few songs. This a true rock epic, combining moments of quiet reflection with moments of roaring intensity. This album is the crown jewel of alternative rock.
B0000028UK|5.0|After the extreme sucess of Ten, Eddie Vedder was skeptical of his fans.  He wondered why they like his band...was it because it was as good as all of us know it is, or was it because it was the &quot;popular&quot; thing to do.  The latter is what Vedder truely believed.  So, he set out to create music he loved that was different from Ten and would bring out the true fan.  In Vs. he acomplished this.  The album is almost like the anti-Ten.  Too many people have brushed it off and said that it does not live up to its predicesor.  Those are not the true Pearl Jam fans.  The album is filled with so many good songs.  Songs with deep meaning and awesome music.  You can see the first steps of Pearl Jam's maturation from a grunge band to a full scall rock and roll band.  There is even a song dedicated to Kurt Cobain(&quot;Go&quot;) after he overdosed and was hospitalized shortly before his suicide.  There are songs of that talk about political, domestic and societal issues and seem to be a bit deeper than Ten.  The album also shows Pearl Jams diverse abilities to be bothe a grunge and rock 'n roll band at the same time.  Anyone expecting this to sound like Ten would be gravely dissapointed, but if  they are looking at this as an individual album by a great band, Vs. is an excellent album that can compare to few released at its time
0553579908|4.0|I am continually impressed with George R R Martin.  I never thought he would suck me into his world...and a marvelous world it is, to!  I've never read a fantasy series where you can truly identify and root for one of the &quot;villains&quot;, nor have I read another work where realism and fantasy are blended so well.  I will definately be buying the third installment.
B00004RHZU|4.0|Pink has a pretty good voice, but she still needs work.  Her songs are repeats off eachother. <br />Me listening to it: Oh great here's another man-bashing song.<br />Anyway, It IS a very good CD but Pink needs to try other types of music.  I think Pink should go into punk music!  She surely looks like the punker!<br />I reccomend if you like to listen to man-bashing songs, this is for you.
B00000IAU3|5.0|A great CD!  Her voice reminds me of Sarah McLachlan and a little bit of Sinead O'Connor.  I loved the first track, &quot;Here With Me&quot; - very romantic.  I don't know how Eminem paired up with this stylish artist, but the &quot;Thank You&quot; track is great.  My husband even liked it and he is a hard-core hard rock lover.
0385484518|3.0|I enjoy reading &quot;Tuesday with Morrie&quot;. It is a quick and inspirational reading. The life - lesson behind the thought of one professor who is soing to die with an uncurable disease is very interesing. Mitch Albom split the book into sub-topics like Love, marriage, death etc... This made it is easy to grap and digest.       However, I might expect too high. It's not the life-changing. It's just another good book that talk about the topic that worth reading. From what my friends told me and read other comments, I think it should have been better.      But I still recommend people to read this book. Read and feel it by yourself.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Every time that there is a new release from a major group like The Beatles, the expectations among the \\"fab-four\\" followers and pop music listeners are extremely high. Fans rush to record stores to buy the new release even without knowing what the album is all about, proving their loyalty to one of the greatest groups in the history of modern music. In my case, after owning all of the Beatles' albums, singles, EPs, official and un-official catalogue, including rehearsals and live material, I have to ask myself where is the real value in a collection of \\"No 1\\" hits. Not being moved by nostalgia any longer I have to point out that there two previous CD releases entitled \\"Past Masters vol. I &amp; II\\", plus a box containing all of the group's singles (hard to get), that offer a broad Beatles' collection, assuming it is \\"singles\\" that you wish to collect (specially those not included in the albums). If you only own a few CDs from the Beatles and want to expand your collection this album will not provide you with all of the \\"great songs\\", but only a few \\"No. 1\\" hits. In that case, I prefer and recommend the \\"red\\" and the \\"blue\\" compilations that offer a better repertoire from both the first and second musical periods(not only their # 1 best selling hits). In case you are a Beatles fan or collector like me, I find it convenient to be able to gather some good Beatles' music in only 1 CD instead of having to take 2 or 3 when I have to travel in my car. In other words, the #1 hits are not necessarily the best music that the group has produced and there are great tunes from \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", \\"White Album\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" that are missing. Instead of releasing \\"the best selling songs\\" I would have enjoyed much more an edition of \\"Beatles' favourites\\" or \\"Beatles Best\\" selected by the three living Beatles, plus John's preferred Beatles songs -revealed in the many interviews granted to several major magazines- In summary, the motivation behind this CD is &quot;strictly&quot; commercial. That is why I am dropping a star in my review in spite that the Beatles are a 5 out of 5 stars group.
0553106635|5.0|This is the best book in the best fantasy series ever written.  Of course, I also said that about &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;.  I never thought that Martin could top that book but he found a way!  If you have any interest in Fantasy you have to read this series.  It will be talked about 50 years from now and become the standard that all fantasy series are compared to.
B000002L42|3.0|I enjoy just about everything from Walter Becker and Donald Fagen.  And this disc is certainly very listenable.  However, as Live recordings go it just seems like a collection of songs.  Any banter between Donald Fagen, Walter Becker and the audience is edited out which hampers from the the feel of a live concert. From attending a Steely Dan concert on this tour and also owning a couple of bootlegs, I know these guys can communicate with an audience in between songs quite effectively. The edit job in that respect is a major dissapointment.<br />As for the songs, most of the versions are fairly interesting.  I particularly like the guitar riffs and drum solo in Josie and Kid Charlemagne chuggs along quite nicely.  Whereas the new version of Reeling In The Years has a fresh feel to it, the studio version is soooo much better with Elliot Randall's legendary guitar solo.  The horn riffs and the half baked backing vocals just cheese upon the live version too much for my ears.  Whereas the eleven songs chosen for this release are all good, I feel that some of their more famous songs(Rikki Don't Lose That Number, Do It Again, Dirty Work) should have made this one.<br />In general, you can't go wrong with any Steely Dan recording.  However the end result in this case could have been much better.
6305064490|5.0|That's right.  Hands down this is the best film of all time. Sure it's sentimental, but I guarantee that even a cursory watching of this film will move you.<br />Life doesn't seem worth living for George Bailey. His Savings and Loan is threatened, Harry Potter has called the police on him, and he is ready to jump from Bedford Falls' nearest high bridge...until Clarence intervenes.<br />Through Clarence, ASC (Angel Second Class - an angel without his wings), George receives a wonderful gift - the chance to see what life would be like if he had never been born.<br />Bedford Falls is named Pottersville.  There is no Bailey Savings and Loan. George's brother is dead.  Mr. Gower, the pharmacist, is a bum.<br />Says Clarence, &quot;Each man's life touches so many other lives. If he wasn't around it would leave an awful hole.&quot;<br />Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed are unforgettable. It's a film that has everything - romance, humor, failure, and success.<br />If you've never seen nor heard of this delightful movie you're missing out.  Rent or buy it today!
0780622642|2.0|I Bought this 2 years ago For my Kids, now its just sitting in my movie shelf...Box is all smashed up and written on((Thats the joy of having kids)) I liked to older one alot better then this one, ya sure it has better efects and its up to date, but cmon after watching this when you were a kid you wouldnt expect the people to be so diffrent, The Cast Reminded me Of Cheech and Chong, They were &quot;Up in smoke&quot; Lol if you see it you will know what i mean, anyways if you really loved the older Lost in space, like me, you would stay away from this at all cost.

0684853523|5.0|Oops, that's an adverb.  This book is a must read for any writer or wannabee.  Great book, no bullsh--.  I was hooked from the first foreward.  Don't pass this up if you are a Stephen King Fan.
0525945636|5.0|Journey to the land of &quot;what ifs.&quot; The heated space race of 1958 is the backdrop for Ken Follett's new thriller. But he examines what could have caused the two day delay in the launch of the first U.S. satellite. The countdown is on and the action is riveting. You won't get bored. You won't get lost. This is an easy read with an explosive plot. Your bookcase is screaming for Code to Zero!
B00000IAU3|4.0|I have trully enjoyed the song &quot;Thank You&quot;. It was in fact, my reason for wanting this CD. I have not been able to really get in to any of the other songs (probably because I have the repeat button set to &quot;Thank You&quot;!) but do find that Dido puts me in mind of Sinead O'conner and/or Cranberry. Both of whom I have &quot;tapes&quot; (for those of us that can remember those) that I still listen to. I would recommend this CD to just about anybody.
0525945636|1.0|By far the worst book Ken Follett has written.  It is incredible to me that the same person wrote &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; and &quot;Pillars of the Earth.&quot;  Ken Follett has been my favorite author for at least a decade and I always look forward with great anticipation to his new releases.  I am thoroughly disappointed with &quot;Code to Zero.&quot;  Like another reviewer, I found myself getting angrier and angrier as I turned the pages.
0064407667|5.0|I was hooked on the series before I even saw this book, having first seen the next two succeeding volumes in a bookstore. The idea of unfortunate events in the world of children was reminiscent of the ones I used to create while still a child, (do you have bad dreams that are a relief to wake up from?  did you fantasize alternate courses for your existence to take?  If so, this is your book!) so of course I had to read the _Series of Unfortunate Events_.  <br />Lemony Snicket apologizes in each book for the sad events contained therein, but at the risk of upsetting the intro, I'd like to add that in some ways the books are every bit as encouraging as they are unhappy.  A common complaint with books in a series is that they often don't stand well alone -- have no fear.  This book is a complete story in itself.  I warn you, however, that you will most likely end up hooked too, and have to read the whole series anyway.<br />_The Bad Beginning_ was perfect, right down to the surprise ending and the hoped for, but impossible happy solution offered by Justice Strauss.  <br />Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent, resourceful, and kind, but from the opening pages, you'll see that their good qualities are all the good luck they seem to have.  They are orphaned right away and sent to live with a series of people.  In this book, you are with them when they learn of their parents' death, and you get the same foreboding feeling about Count Olaf as the children have. Violet can invent almost anything she needs for a sticky situation. Klaus, a voracious reader, knows almost every word there is, and is invaluable as a researcher.  Sunny, with those teeth of hers, could be a bodyguard despite her tender age. The special skills of each orphan come brilliantly into play for the resolution of this story.  I thought by the end, that I knew how the children would escape from the Count's evil plan to inherit the Baudelaire fortune, but I was pleasantly surprised to be wrongabout that.  <br />Buy it.  You'll like it.  Your 12 year old neice will like it.  By the time you've seen the second book, you'll also be wondering who Beatrice is, and hanging on to the clues given to that seemingly unrelated thread in each book.   I also want to add that the volumes of the series are beautifully presented in the physical printed binding way, as if they're destined to become treasured antiques, and why wouldn't they be, after all?

B000000OTY|4.0|Peter Gabriel is an outstanding live performer and this concert recording makes a valiant attempt to capture the emotion brought forth by a Gabriel performance. A solid list of great songs and true concert recordings help, but the element of joy that is found in Gabriel's live performances is missing. This album gives an approximation of what a Gabriel concert is like but misses the immediacy and power of the performance. The material and performances are excellent; it just can't quite truly recreate the experience. For alternate versions of many of Gabriel's best songs; however, it can't be left out of any fan's collection.
B000050XEI|5.0|I just recently purchased her ''Paint The Sky With Stars'' CD and was so impressed that I bought 3 of her previously released CD's and plan to buy all her music. I have to agree with other critics that although the quality of the music in this CD is superb I wish the songs were a little longer. The songs are a little to short which is a little dissapointing when you enjoy each song so much and it ends so soon. Aside from this she is truely talented and her music is very unique with a combination of modern classical and pop with a hint of an Angelic tone. I still recommend you buy this CD. Anybody who has an appreciation for music will certainly enjoy her music.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This Cd has it all! Soul-songs, bittersweet-songs, and just plain PUNK ROCK SONGS! All tracks are beautiful, but &quot;Around the World&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot;, and &quot;Road Trippin&quot; are my favorite on this well thought and perfect album. BUY IT!

B00004XOWM|3.0|This Cd was okay, but I really was expecting more from this hard rock band. After their great album, &quot;Significent Other&quot;, I thought that they could avoid the sophmore slump that so many bands run into, but it appears I was wrong. Some songs, like &quot;Rollin&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot; are appealing, but most of the others drop below the mark.
B0000524E5|3.0|Let's begin with what this movie is NOT: It isn't Academy material nor is it a cure for cancer.  It IS a fun, romantic (and yes, sometimes cliched) fairy tale about attractive young people pursuing dreams.  The performances are credible and the music propels the story along at a pace that keeps you from concentrating too much on the paper-thin plot line.  For those gray days when you need entertainment that lifts the spirit even if it doesn't tax the mind, this movie fills the bill.  Remember &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, &quot;Footloose&quot; and &quot;Flashdance&quot;?  If you like these movies (and I do), sit back, dispend disbelief and just enjoy the exuberant show!
B00003CXE7|5.0|for anyone who wants to watch an action packed, dramatic, and informative movie, this is a good one for you.  maybe the best movie i have ever seen!  certainly worth buying!
B00003CX6P|5.0|One of my favorite films of 1999.  While it doesn't top the poetic beauty of Minghella's earlier Oscar-winning The English Patient, it's still a gorgeous film.<br />In my opinion, the first half is better than the second, due in large part to the presence of Jude Law who exudes an ambiguous and captivating sensuality.  Who wouldn't want to know this guy? Matt Damon gives a remarkably chilling performance.  Gwyneth Paltrow is like a reincarnation of Grace Kelly though I'm not generally as enamored of her acting as many others seem to be.  Cate Blanchett does well as a spoiled American rich girl who falls for Ripley.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman also gives a terrific supporting performance.<br />However, it's the cinematography that really elevates this film.  The Italian locales are sun-drenched and staggeringly beautiful.  The colors absolutely shine.<br />Gabriel Yared's score provides more than orchestral back-up.  It captures the style and tone of the period and enhances the tension as the plot unfolds onscreen.<br />Bellissima!
B00003CXAT|5.0|It's indeed rare when a movie comes along that is so special, and has such a tremendous impact on audiences of all ages, that when it happens, it's an occasion for celebration; which is exactly what Steven Spielberg gave the world with \\"Jurassic Park,\\" a film that made the impossible possible:  It enabled dinosaurs to walk among us.  He put these monsters from a bygone era on the screen for all to see, and the unique thing about it was that they were real; so real you could reach out and touch them it seemed.  And in doing so he touched the imaginations of every child who sat there in the dark of a theater and watched his creations come to life, and he touched the child that still resides within every adult who came to see his show as well.  Jaded moviegoers and those who affect cynicism as a mission statement of life may scoff, especially now, after some time has passed and the magic has worn off somewhat, but it doesn't alter the fact that with this movie, Spielberg surpassed any and all standards of the cinematic world and set the precedent for all that would follow.  To borrow a line from one of his own characters, he \\"Spared no expense,\\" and simply made one of the most exciting and memorable films in the history of the Silver Screen.  Spielberg pulled out all the stops to make this remarkable film, and it goes without saying that the special F/X are incredible; what's easy to overlook amid all the spectacle of it, however, are the performances turned in by one and all, and most notably by Jeff Goldblum, who brings such nuance and style to the role of Dr. Ian Malcolm.  It's a supporting role into which he immersed himself to create one of the more memorable characters in the film, and his performance-- with the countenance and attitude he lends to Malcolm, even the commanding, mesmerizing way he speaks-- has never received the attention it so richly deserved.  Nor has the performance of Richard Attenborough, as John Hammond, the entrepreneur who makes Jurassic Park a reality.  He's such a gifted performer that he makes you forget he's acting; Hammond becomes real, which makes what he's doing real, and it's just another example of the many things that add up to make this such an incredible movie.  Spielberg and his cast and crew have given such care to detail that it, in effect, releases the viewer from the baggage of even having to suspend disbelief because they're given a world that is \\"real\\" from the ground up.  The result of using all of the magic available, and using it wisely.  Also turning in outstanding-- and entirely believable performances-- are Sam Neill, as Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, as Dr. Ellie Sattler, each creating figures central to the plot and around whom much of the action revolves.  And there are a number of performances in supporting roles that are just too good to go unmentioned as well,  including Bob Peck, as Muldoon, the park's head gamekeeper; Martin Ferrero, as the \\"blood-sucking\\" lawyer, Donald Gennaro; Wayne Knight, as computer hacker Dennis Nedry; Samuel L. Jackson, as computer programmer Ray Arnold; and last, but not least, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, through whose eyes the child in all of us vicariously experiences the wonders of Jurassic Park.  The wonderful thing about a movie like \\"Jurassic Park\\" is that, not only will it forever remain as a testimonial to a filmmaker of genius and vision, but that it will be there for all the generations that follow to discover anew.  The world may change drastically around us, even from one day to the next, but as long as even a single spark of imagination survives, one thing will always remain constant:  The fascination by children of all ages for these legendary beasts that once ruled the earth.  And that is why, when all is said and done and the skeptics have become no more than shadows and dust, this film-- as well as Steven Spielberg-- will remain a cause for celebration.  This is the legacy, and the true magic of the movies.
0316777722|5.0|This is a terrific book of essays and observations by an NPR regular. He is quite revealing about his upbringing, and his lifestyle, but the real fun is his sketches of life in North Carolina, New York City and Paris.<br />His stories on learning French were unique and spot-on to me. He also skewers &quot;Americans abroad&quot;, and French culture. If you like to smile and laugh while reading, this is your book. (I won't be forgeting his brother &quot;The Rooster&quot;, or his &quot;fat&quot; sister, Amy, anytime soon.)
B00004XONN|4.0|EVERYTHING IN IT'S RIGHT PLACE - sampled voices get kinda annoying, but has a cool future keyboard<br />KID A - cool drums, neat voice, and no point<br />THE NATIONAL ANTHEM - dumb lyrics, easy notes, but damn, does that bass rock<br />HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY - awesome. slow dreamy and detached, with lyrics that make you think a little<br />TREEFINGERS - like life in slow motion<br />OPTIMISTIC - sarcastic lyrics and cool guitar. gets kinda messy, though<br />IN LIMBO - works for about two minutes, then begins to drone<br />IDIOTEQUE - dance beats kinda turned me off, but the emotion in the lyrics kept me listening (drums did get pretty cool too)<br />MORNING BELL - one of my favorites on the CD, and I dont know why. That little screechy noise in the end surprisingly reminded me of the whale calls in Pink Floyd's &quot;Echoes&quot;<br />MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK - that last lyric will send a chill up your spine<br />Radiohead reinvent themselves, pissing off some, exciting others. As a whole, the album rocks, painting a kinda barren glacial landscape in your mind. And man, is &quot;the national anthem&quot; fun to play on full bass
0440219078|5.0|I bought this book to give as a gift, and ended up reading it myself. A scary and thought-provoking book, chillingly and beautifully written, right up to the ambiguous ending.<br />I think this is a very worthwhile read. If you have not yet read this book I suggest you don't read many of the amazon reviews. Many of the reviews give away every single major plot point. I find this very disappointing and am glad I did not read many reviews before I read the book, as much of the power and gut-wrenching effect come from discovering the answers yourself as the story unfolds. Read the book. If you want to read other reader reviews wait until you've read the book first. It's worth it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|AIRBAG - guitar and cello put together with chopped up drums. Where can you go wrong?<br />PARANOID ANDROID - one of the best on the album. A pretty, techno oriented part gives way to a menacing guitar riff, before all hell breaks loose, followed by a wild solo followed by... What? Full range of chorus, singing a beautiful melody? It's so beautiful. Bam! Crazy guitar. Songs over.<br />HOMESICK ALIEN - cool jam. Those guitars, sounding like talking aliens.<br />EXIT MUSIC - one of the more depressed songs, the background talking reminded me of the children playing on &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Pt 2&quot;. Huh. Intimate guitar and vocals gives way to fretless bass and crazy sounds that inspire unabashed anger, but a sorrowful kind, like you know you cant win.<br />LET DOWN - one of the more flawed tracks on the album, somewhat dull guitar and refrain, but awesome double vocals and a nice descending melody.<br />KARMA POLICE - sarcasm, sarcasm, sarcasm. But I tell you, when that part comes up where the singer loses himself and gets washed away by the music, it made me want to cry, it was so pretty. Hey, i aint a pansy either. It's just so good to here good music.<br />FITTER HAPPIER - the track you will skip most often, unless listening to cd as whole. Weird, almost like HAL getting emotions.<br />ELECTIONEERING - for some reason this reminded me of Hitler. Maybe it was supposed to. Sloppy and rocky. But its supposed to be.<br />CLIMBING UP WALLS - cool drums and spooky distort explodes in solo, and Thom finally goes crazy screaming. Creepy.<br />NO SURPRISES - not the best, but pretty and sad. We can relate.<br />LUCKY - cool guitar and vocals. This will take a while to get into.<br />THE TOURIST - another flawed song, dull, until that wonderful &quot;hey man slow down&quot; and guitar come in. Ends on the perfect note.<br />The lyrics are a mess, open to any interpretation. The melodies and sheer emotion, not to mention scope, make this thing the best of the 90s. Yeah, I think so to. So sue me.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I am -- or was- a really big fan of the X-Men comic books, [had the complete run from January 1980 to January 1995] So I didn't really know what to expect from the X-Men movie. I came away pleasantly impressed.<br />The acting was top-notch. When I heard that Patrick Stewart was to portray Professor Xavier, I had mixed feelings. I had no doubt that he would do an excellent job in the role, but I was concerned that he might end up being an otherwise excellent actor in a lame movie (&aacute; la Sean Connery in &quot;The Avengers&quot;). I was therefore very pleased to watch the movie and find that wasn't the case with X-Men. Stewart gave a stellar performance, opposite the equally excellent Sir Ian McKellen (&quot;Magneto&quot;). Other good performances were put in by the really splendid Hugh Jackman (&quot;Wolverine&quot;), Anna Paquin (&quot;Rogue&quot;), and Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly).<br />Turning a comic book into a movie is a dangerous endeavor (again, look no further than &quot;The Avengers&quot;), but X-Men pulled it off just right. The movie takes itself seriously (but not too seriously), and--from what I've heard--it remains pretty faithful to the existing X-Men story, without alienating the uninitiated. It also makes the viewer think about important issues, such as racism, instead of just being a brainless, explosion-filled, ammo-laden action movie. Yet the action is there, and movie never gets too heavy or preachy on the issues.<br />Visually, X-Men is stunning, featuring some really slick computer animation, particularly Wolverine's claws and the scene where Xavier uses the mind-machine to find Rogue. The sound and music complimented the on-screen action. The plot and the explanations of the characters' backstories were interesting, and left things wide open for a sequel.<br />Overall, X-Men is worth your money.
0062513346|2.0|Although I consider The Alchemist as one of the best books I have ever read, Coelho's effort with The Valkyries disappoints me somewhat. The story of him and his wife Chris crossing the Californian desert in search of their individual angels is told in a truthful, heartfelt way. The story is beautifully told as only Paulo can.<br />I appreciate the honesty and openness Paulo demonstrates by sharing his true story with us. I don't belong The Tradition, and don't profess to know its secrets. Fundamentally I disagree with Paulo in this book. The main point I do disagree with is that he states that only angels can show us the way to paradise, no one else can. I think if Paulo read the New Testament a bit more carefully, he would realise that this is not necessarily so. Angels are indeed real, they are messengers, they minister us, we do get angels of Death and Wrath, they fight for what is right, etc. Yet Paulo also mentions that in the kingdom of angels there is no good and evil. But, since they are fighting for us, how can this be true? Since angels fight in the spiritual world, there must be a good and evil side.  There are a lot of basic truths that I agree with Paulo, and I think that those make the book worthwhile. Unfortunately it does not compare to the quality of The Alchemist. I found this a tedious read, even though I'm very fond of his writing.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This film is probably the best blockbuster of the summer. It has grisly and rousing action, wonderful technical direction from Ridley Scott, and masterful performances from Crowe and Pheonix.<br />Flaws always first. The opening battle sequence is confusing, and tries to be chaotic, when it is just incoherent. However, the rest of the film justifies Scott's technical brilliance (more on that later). The screenplay isn't as much a story told with action sequences but a string of action sequences with some connecting thread. However, it allows for some great acting. The script introduces a startling relationship between Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) and his sister Lucilla (Connie Nelson), giving Pheonix and added dimension to chew through.<br />And does he ever. One of his three films this year, Pheonix proves that he can act in several diverse roles. This will probably garner him on Oscar nomination. His snivelling, ambitious emperor provides a fine foil for Crowe's Maximus. Crowe finally cements his star status with this film, after amazing turns in The Insider and L.A. Confidential. His performance is brutal and intense. In fact, the screenplay spares nothing on his character, giving Crowe several powerful scenes (the climax, his prison conversation with Lucilla, and his earlier conversation with Marcus Aurelius). He'll probably get an oscar nod as well.<br />Now, the direction of Ridley Scott. I am a huge fan of his, so I was pleased to see him handle both the technical and narrative direction with equal aptitude. His technical direction is superb, ranking with Blade Runner, Legend and Alien. For the balance, he has paid attention to the story (as in Thelma and Louise and Someone to Watch over Me). And it has paid off handsomely. Look for Gladiator to have the most nominations at the academy awards this year
B00000J6AG|5.0|Play is a great album. I had never heard of Moby until about five months ago, when I saw him perform on the PBS show, '54', and, ever since then, I have been hooked. I got 'Play' and loved it.   I think this album is very well-crafted, with each song flowing into the next.  After listening to this album, I found Everything Is Wrong, and then I Like To Score, and , most recently, Ambient, and I've loved every one of them.  One thing I have learned about Moby is that he cannot be put into one category of music. He mixes styles together, and doesn't confine himself to just techno or just rock. Personnaly, I think that there's at least one Moby song (or remix) that people who think they don't like Moby will love. <br />I've read some of the not so favorable reviews of 'Play' here, and the negativity of some of these people is just appalling. Geez, let people make their own judgments.  I'm not telling anyone to go out and buy 'Play' right now. I'm just saying what I like about Moby. <br />Give it a try, listen to some songs from 'Play', and, if you like them, go buy the album or whatever other recording may intrigue you.  Don't let other people's opinions of something you haven't experienced decide whether or not you should experience it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I still cannot believe how many people do not know that this movie exists. I wonder if this film would have ever been released if it was not for the current trend in cult releases on DVD and tape. It may not be the best movie ever made, but it is definitely one of the best fantasy films of modern cinema.<br />Sure, maybe some of the effects may be dated by today's standards or the film may have been marketed for children, but ... who cares? The work on the design of this production alone should have won it several awards, David Bowie's performance still stands out as incredible, and the story itself is a lot deeper than most will admit. But hey, at least that fact has not hurt the film's popularity. Only something as well done as this could withstand the tests of time in a film industry like ours.<br />Regardless of anyone who might disagree as to how good or bad Labyrinth is, no one can deny it's power to generate a fan base that could survive without any means to purchase a copy for so long. Only something that can touch people's hearts and minds could do something like that. The eighties heralded so many well done fantasy productions that I wish it would become a filmmaking trend again someday.<br />Labyrinth, The Never Ending Story, The Princess Bride, Return to Oz, and Legend were truly some of the most painstakingly detailed, amazingly directed, and beautifully scored films that I can think of. I may have originally viewed them as a young child, but over the years not one of them has disappeared from my memories. As one grows older one forgets the unmemorable, but not works of art like these. After just viewing Labyrinth again, I can see that even though I've grown and I've learned many things about filmmaking itself, this movie still amazes me. Even if some have a problem with the pace or are avid haters of muppets, they should sit down and give this film a chance. At times it almost seems as if the characters in the film are just walking through a wonderfully done canvas of colors, and I am not talking about the matte paintings.<br />There are points where the viewer just forgets that they are even viewing a film and become mesmerized by the music, visuals, and feel of Labyrinth. One might think that Bowie's music, having been a fad of the eighties, would have also been awkward after a decade or so, but that is not the case either. The music just seems to fit as if it were never part of the real world at all but just more of what one would expect from mischievous goblins out to have fun or Jareth's attempts at wooing the heroine.<br />If I had to pick one thing about this film that will truly leave anyone in awe, it is the ballroom sequence. I have not seen many films in my life that have given a feel of a hypnotizing dream like Frank Oz and Jim Henson did in that scene. The symbolism equally matched with a romanticized score, perfectly timed dance choreography and unbelievable costume designing make for one of the grandest scenes I have ever viewed.<br />I'm very happy that now after more than a decade, this film has been restored and given a chance at new life. Maybe now more will learn of it and give it the appreciation it deserves.lly done canvas of colors, and I am not talking about the matte paintings. <br />There are points where the viewer just forgets that they are even viewing a film and become mesmerized by the music, visuals, and feel of Labyrinth.

0783229321|5.0|I give it 5 stars though because it was good, I like my funny movies with a little slapstick like Airplane and The Naked Gun, because Movies that are done from people on SNL are just not funny for a reason, I prefer John Hughes Movie's More than this stuff, Animal House was good but you need to see it twice, to know what it is. I like this movie because It had people rebeling against the college and that I loved.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna's newest foray on the pop scene is a complete overhaul over her previous incarnations... and it is completely refreshing. As opposed to artists who returned to the fringe with records sounding just as if the 90s had never happened (i.e. Eurythmics's &quot;Peace&quot;) Madonna always looks to re invent herself. Sometimes, one must admit, it's not as succesful (anyone ever wondered where &quot;Dita&quot; is nowadays?)but this time she walks away with all the honors, and possibly will repeat her feat at the Grammys and the AMM Ceremony.<br />The lady is trendy and she knows where &quot;It&quot;'s at. The title track, plus &quot;Amazing&quot;, &quot;I deserve it&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot; -- that ole chestnut always is good- are rocking, well-crafted experiments of fusion. She has been compared in time to Joni Mitchell... and you know what? They might not be all that wrong.

6304696515|5.0|You wouldn't necessarily think that an adaptation of an albeit famous 17th century French novel would make a relevant and fascinating piece of cinema... but it does.<br />The first thing that strikes you is how well the film is lit and shot. The period locations and costumes are visually sumptuous and perfect. Better yet, the acting entirely matches the skill of the direction that takes its method from the theatre - emotions are conveyed by expression and not dialogue. Glenn Close gives her best performance on celluloid as the scheming Madame de Merteuil, amorally hellbent on bending everyone to her will, no matter the method or the cost, and John Malkovitch is her perfect foil as the cynical hedonistic but world-weary Valmont. Michelle Pfeiffer engages our empathy as the tortured and manipulated target of Malkovitch's desire and Close's plotting.<br />The film is basically a morality tale, but one that fascinates in its exposure of ego, vanity, intrigue and the war between the genders, subjects that are timeless in their relevance, despite the period setting. The storyline, which sticks faithfully to the original novel, remains compelling throughout as we watch deceits within deceits take their tragic course. Whole-heartedly recommended - take your time over it, and enjoy.
0553106635|5.0|I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviews.  I have read most of the major series out there (tolkein, goodkind, jordan, eddings, tad williams, etc.) and this series is far better than any of those.  The contrast people are making with Jordan and the Wheel of time is particularly good.  Jordan's series fell apart after the second book and has become progressively more vapid with each passing volume (even the first two were nowhere near as good as the Clash of Kings and the Game of Thrones).  GRM has gotten better with each book.  His characters keep getting better, the plot gets better, the storytelling gets better, the world is more intricate.  His willingness to put every character &quot;in play&quot; so to speak adds an urgency to every page that is absent from every other series I have ever read (do we really think that Rand Al Thor is going to die before the last book for example?).  You cannot know what is going to happen with each subsequent chapter, only that it will be interesting and perhaps shocking.  On one level the series works purely as a study of medieval politics.  However, the current book suggests that we are about to move into more magical and mystical dimensions in coming volumes with more on wargs, dragons, others, etc.  The plot twists are shocking but logical and now you can see that the major characters are being developed in unexpected ways that leaves open the possibility that the series will devolop in a completely new direction.  A great series that shames all those that come before.  There is not much uplifting stuff in GRMs world but it is tough to walk away from.  Also no kid under 14 should read this book as it is substantially more gritty than other fantasy epics.<br />If the author is reading reads I would suggest no more than 5 books...that should be enough to bring the story lines together and reach a satisfying conclusion. Any more than two more books and you risk jordanizing yourself...writing more pages not in the aid of the narrative but because you know that people will cough up $20 for a hardback.  This series is too good for that. Keep up the good work.the narrative but because you know that people will cough up $20 for a hardback.  This series is too good for that. Keep up the good work.
0788815490|5.0|Why, oh, why can't American films take a hint from these wonderful British films?  No explosions.  No special effects.  No half-naked jiggly girls to keep the teenage boys happy.  Just solid first-rate acting.  Intelligent dialog.  Beautiful scenery.  Is it really too much to ask for?<br />This is a gorgeous movie.  Helena Bonham Carter is excellent, as usual.  You can read the plot summaries from other reviewers here, so I won't elaborate.  But I do urge you to rent or buy this movie.  It's a wonderful story of love, betrayal, sex (yup, there's some of that), guilt, and innocence lost.  It's much more than a mere &quot;chick flick&quot;.
038533348X|5.0|This is clearly one of KV's best books.  He has a way of writing a science fiction book without it seeming like science fiction.  The focus seems to be more on the characters than the plot idea. The description on the book jacket emphasizes all the wrong parts, so don't let that turn you off.
B00004WKII|5.0|I have been blown away.  Outtakes,  alternate versions of Jimi's most beloved songs,  and unrelease live material makes this box one of the best collections I have ever seen.  The packaging is beautiful,  from the outside casing to the liner notes,  which contain dozens  of beautiful pictures,  flavorful novelties like posters and the recording invoices,  and some of Jimi's lyric sheets.<br />There is a strong collection of Jimi's best known material,  such as &quot;Purple Haze,&quot;  &quot;Foxey Lady,&quot;  &quot;Hey Joe,&quot;  &quot;The Wind Cries Mary,&quot;  and so on,  all in alternate mixes,  live takes and some outtakes.  The intro to &quot;Third Stone,&quot;  and the Outtake version of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; are both funny and definitely worth a listen.<br />And it's not just the songs a casual listener would know.  There is a strong collection from Jimi Hendrix's blues,  hard rock,  and pre-metal styles,  which die hard fans will mostly know,  though not as they are released here.<br />Experience Hendrix is a wonderful set which does a great job at portraying one of the best guitarists to have walked the face of the earth.  In the face of his tragic death,  at least we have a lot to remember him by.
6303168507|5.0|I saw this movie just a few days after it was first released in theaters and when it was over I just sat in my seat and could not move.  The emotional impact of this movie is greater than you could ever imagine.  The fact that it is a real-life story helps to bring it home.  Expect to be saddened and deep in thought once it is over.  The tape is great, minus the inconvenience of having to get up halfway through the movie to switch tapes in your VCR....but this is a fault of VHS tapes, not the movie.  This is a classic everyone must own.
B000053V7O|5.0|Some movies are meant to entertain, others are meant to be thoughtful.  Yes, this movie moves slow, but I think that it's meant to mimic the pace of our own daily experiences.  Dale and Francois are meant to be, perhaps, uncomfortably real, hence they each have their disturbing flaws.  (Incidently, I don't count Dexter Gordon's voice as a flaw... it came with the great musician.  Get over it.) Still, I found myself endeared to both. Lots of metaphores thorughout the movie between music, music making and living.  The music is great, if not something of an anachronism.  There are many scenes that seem unecessary, but I think they are unexplained elements that are, perhaps, meant for us to interpret for ourselves. This move is constructed differently than most, so I urge you not to apply the same criteria you would other movies.  It's like looking at a painting for a long time and coming away with your own meaning.  Probably the most artistic movie in my collection to date.
6305363668|5.0|This is not a movie for you if you like movies that allow you to turn your brain off and have everything spoon-fed to you.  This futuristic movie takes a look at the definition of life and the conflict between humans and technology.  It also addresses some ethical questions about creating or destroying life.  The music is awesome and is perfectly matched to the tone of the movie and its themes.
0930289234|5.0|Think you're a hardcore comic book fan? not until you pick this up. A work of genius, this tells a story how a comic book has never been told before. The plotline is the best that has ever been told, with emotion that has never been seen in a &quot;funny&quot; book before. The artwork is just as good. So detailed its scary. No comic book fan should go with out it.
0792151712|5.0|I am not one to cry at movies....I never do.  But at the end of this one I could not help myslef and a few tears rolled down my cheeks.  I realize that some people critique this movie for creating a fictional couple and focusing the movie on them, but in my view, this is what makes the movie so great.  I have always heard about Titanic and how many people died and what could have been done differently to save hundreds of lives, but I never actually got it.  After watching this movie I was able to realize that every single individual on that ship had a story behind them and that every single one of them lost something or someone.  The fact that I could also relate to the story of the fictional couple only made the movie doubly as good, or in this case, dobly as sad.  This is an epic movie which people will enjoy for decades to come, just like Gone with the Wind.
B00003CXDG|1.0|This is just another John Woo movie ; the protagonist ~always~ flies in the air, spiralling like a just-dropped wild-cat, both guns blazing ... thank god for only a pair of hands ; lest we have four or more hand guns blazing !<br />For those who liked the first &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; , be warned that this is the worst of all sequels. MI2 only shares the first two letters in common and that's about it ( and oh yea, Ethan Hunt too ). Besides that, forget Mission Impossible as you knew it. Ethan Hunt becomes a one man army (a la Rambo in Rambo III) instead of being a member of an elite team of highly trained, well-coordinated crack spies.<br />The plot ( huh? ) is terrible and the movie is merely an excuse for special-effects pyrotechnics with the sound-engineers having a field day. <br />On the positive side ( yes ! there IS a positive side ) the sound effects are great and the aural space is indeed very impressive. The visual effects are nice but nothing to write home about. And the scene in which Ethan brings the bike to a &quot;one-wheelie (yippee)&quot; halt and turns around to blow the car ? A definite must-avoid scene ... it reeks of machismo and nothing else to it. And the one in which he jumps sky-high of a speeding mobike ? The lesseor said the better !<br />After all is said and done , this is more of a movie made by the special FX team and the stunt co-ordinators . I guess in all the hoopla, they forgot to budget for a script-writer!
B00000099Y|5.0|I've heard many a review of Tool's &quot;AEnema&quot;, one by amazon.com itself, call this album &quot;muddy&quot; and more &quot;disorganized&quot; than the superior band's other two albums; &quot;Opiate&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot;. I believe that &quot;AEnema&quot; is just as great as the other CD's, just that Tool is trying new kinds of music and takes their fans to other places. Even though the CD was released back in 1996, this album leaves fans guessing at the meanings to the lyrics and titles to this day.<br />This album has, by far, jumped to a new level than the other two Tool albums, both of which focused more on the hard rock and guitar riffs on most of the songs. Several songs on &quot;AEnema&quot; are softer and more lightly textured, but are by no means mellow. Songs such as &quot;jimmy&quot;, &quot;Pushit&quot;, and &quot;H.&quot; are toned down to less hard rock as songs such as &quot;Hooker With A Penis&quot;, but are just as energetic, meaningful, and powerful as every other Tool song. In fact, the contrast between the heaviness in some parts of the songs and the softer display gives a darker feel to the tunes. &quot;Forty Six &amp; 2&quot; is one of the best examples of how quickly the song can change beat and mood, yet still strangely hold onto and keep grasp of the same eerie atmosphere.<br />But old Tool fans don't have to worry. There is still that heavy, hard rock element in the majority of the songs on the album. The three singles &quot;Stinkfist&quot; &quot;Forty Six &amp; 2&quot;, and the title track &quot;AEnema&quot; have the more familiar, older style that Tool is known for. Other great reflections of Tool's raw power and energy are &quot;Hooker With A Penis&quot;, &quot;Third Eye&quot;, and &quot;Eulogy&quot;.<br />A close listener will also notice that Tool's music has become more experimental on this album, as is seen on all four of the instrumental tracks on the album. Although Tool's lyrics are part of their power and energy, they still give off a strange and haunting vibe and mood with the instrumental songs &quot;Useful Idiot&quot;, &quot;Intermission&quot;, &quot;Cesaro Summability&quot;, and &quot;(-) Ions&quot;. Also, the strangely woven &quot;Message To Harry Manback&quot; is a great example.<br />Whether you're not sure about Tool or are just a fan of their previos two albums, I recommend this album to you, and am quite confident that it will make a Tool fan out of you. This is a great CD, and definitely belongs on real music fans shelves. The songs and lyrics are deep, and make you both think and feel them. What's not to like?
B000001EEN|4.0|Due to the people accompanying him, and because of Pete Townsends' nice gesture, this album is often overrated. It's not silly in the way that Oar of Madcap laughs are, but obviously Clapton was not in best shape.<br />It's an emotional affair mostly and a curious artefact of the days that Clapton seemed lost. Also, it's actually better than his mellow studio albums of the 70's (with a reggae song on them).<br />In conclusion: great live blues album by interesting band but not the best.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson's film 'Magnolia' is a movie that captures the full attention of the viewer from the first stories of chance and coincidence to the seemingly apocalyptic storm of frogs that draw all of the characters together.  Some of the performances seem a bit overdone, most notably Julianne Moore as Linda Partridge, but with the small amount of time allotted to develop each character and advance the story, these types of performances are more than necessary to give the viewer a sense of pathos and sympathy for each character and his or her struggles.  Directorally, Anderson is nothing less than genius.  It's very rare to find a young writer/director who is equally adept with a camera and a pen.  The movie is a masterpiece, both complex and visually stunning.  A film like this should be the hallmark of a director's career.  Fortunately for everybody, Anderson has the best years of his career ahead of him.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead continues to produce music that is hard to categorize because they seem to reinvent themselves each album. The music will not be heard much on the top 40 radio stations because it is more art than marketing. This album will appeal to the listener who wants to hear something new each time he or she listens to a song, there are so many layers to each song it will keep your ears and your brain busy for a while.
0688145078|5.0|This is my favorite sibling book.  It makes being the big kid fun and emphasizes the fun things my son does that babies can't do.  It also introduces the idea of the big brother and baby interacting in a happy way (developing an independent relationship without parents).  My son would listen to the story and seemed to absorb it.  Now that the baby has arrived, he will try to feed her his food and when I tell him she can't have it, he will say &quot;Baby can't have it, baby's to little.&quot;  I didn't tell him that she's to little, the &quot;to little&quot; for food concept comes from the book.  He also talks to her when she is in her chair or swing and I am in the next room -- just like the boy in the book.  The only down side is that he doesn't always use her name, but calls her &quot;Baby,&quot; which also seems to come from the book.

0679879269|5.0|I've read other reviews on this book, some of which condemn and some of which praise it. I would have to fall in the praising category. This trilogy is not only excellently written, I believe that it is great for challenging your beliefs and theology. Some would say that this trilogy and namely this book are blasphemous and not suitable for anyone to read unless with extreme caution, are not capable of reading anything except books that agree with every aspect of their own beliefs. This book is a challenge to traditional beliefs of God, btu that does not mean it is bad. If you really read this book with an open mind, you see that the &quot;facts&quot; in this book are very off from those traditional views and if you are strong in your faith at all, then this book will do nothing to you faith and is perfectly suitable for anyone to read.
B00000BKDV|3.0|I've been a Maiden fan for about 2 years now, but lack of money prevented me from buying most of their albums (y'know how it is!). Now that I have a job, I've been investing in large amounts of good music, and that includes this. Just in case you were wondering why it took me so long to but this album.<br />So I eagarly brought home this CD and my opinion was, well, mixed. It was alright, I guess, but I'd already heard most other Maiden stuff (both the Di'Anno albums and most of the Dickinson stuff) and I have to say that compared to Powerslave or 7th Son of a 7th Son, this fell flat on its arse. It didn't grab me and immerse me like other Maiden albums.<br />Now I've given it another chance, and I recognise how good it is. Songs like Where Eagles Dare and The Trooper are real standouts. This is a solid album. But I still don't think it is their best, or even one of their best, never mind a classic. In order to be a good Maiden album, it has to be pretty damn good, and unfortunatly, songs like Aces High (Powerslave), Moonchild (7th Son Of A 7th Son), Chaught Somewhere In Time (Somewhere In Time) or Number Of The Beast are all excellent songs by Maiden that I'd rather listen to and are from, in my opinion, much better albums. This album was overhyped in my opinion.<br />I wouldn't recommend this to a casual fan and definately not a newcomer to Iron Maiden. I think this album should be heard first before you decide to buy it.  A good Iron Maiden album? Yes A classic metal album? I don't think so. Check out Live After Death.<br />3 1/2 stars
047158651X|4.0|At some places The Book is frustratingly superficial, and Index is a disappointment at times. But clearly written, good illustrations, overall impression is good.
B00000BKDY|5.0|I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! I only really bought this album because I heard it was alright and I hadn't heard many of the tracks off it, but I put it in and I was shocked at how good it was! When I first heard the band, I thought they were amazing. I have been a fan of Iron Maiden for about 2 1/2 years now, and inevitably the appeal of Iron Maiden (or any band that I've been into far some time) has somewhat worn off. However, this album gave me the feeling of &quot;Oh my God, this is GOOOOD...&quot;, something which I hadn't got from an Iron Maiden album in ages!<br />The music is well structured, the melodies are great and the lyrics are well thought out (compared to most metal bands at the time). Tracks like Caught Somewhere In Time and The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner are amazing... dammit, they're all great! I haven't owned this for long enough to decide yet, but this might evolve to be my favourite Maiden album.<br />This is a great album. I don't care who said it was crap (one person even said that it was as bad as &quot;No Prayer For The Dying&quot;). I love this album, and it has refreshed my love for Maiden's music where even Piece Of Mind didn't when I bought that a few months ago. This album shows a real sense of maturity and progression. Don't get me wrong, I like thier older stuff as well, but many bands have either produced a string of albums that sound exactly alike or they've changed for the worse. However, just when Maiden thought that they couldn't top Powerslave, they release this - and it doesn't just sound like an improved version of Powerslave! It's probably Maiden's most most unique album in terms of its sound. Fantastic.
0446310786|5.0|I can still remember the first time I read this book. I was in my early teens at the time it wasn't required reading or anything - I read it because I had heard it was good - and it was. I was surprised then how good it was and it surprises me each time I re-read it. I think because it is deceptively simple that I forget just how complex the themes are in it between re-readings.<br />It is told from the point of view of Scout, who is about 8 years old when the story begins and because it is from her point of view much of the 'lesson-learning&quot; themes in it are beautifully distilled. It is left to us, as much as to her, to interpret the actions and the consequences. What starts as a simple summer holiday for her and her brother Jem slowly builds into a complex story of forgiveness, patience and understanding. There is Boo Radley - a mentally deficient neighbour who is seems to only be a figment of legend rather than reality, the angry elderly neighbour who they are forced to visit, their father, Atticus, a lawyer, and the case he has to defend, a black man accused of molesting a white woman.<br />I just loved the way each new story was introduced - in the episodic way things do in childhood, but gradually each story seemed to interweave.Its so beautifully and simply written and the storyline so satisfying that I recommend it - and re-read it every year or so.
B000006045|5.0|Liz Fraser is back! The songs she sings in are the cherry on top of the worlds best hot fudge sundae. Her voice and Massive Attack's wonderful music compliment each other like in the early Cocteau Twin albums. I've been a fan of electronica since the beginning (I even had an LP when I was a kid titled &quot;Joy!&quot; which was a collection of classical &quot;hits&quot; re-done electronically) and this has got to be one of the best ones I've heard. I'll play this until the laser burns through the CD! Do yourself a favor and dump Kid Rock and that M&amp;M kid and buy this CD. This is where its at!
B000035Z3K|5.0|I recommend this DVD to anyone who is a Dracula or Lugosi fan.  This DVD has the spanish version of Dracula also.  The American crew show Lugosi's dracula during the day, then the spanish crew came on the same set with different actors and shot the spanish version at night.  I viewed both versions one afternoon.  If you watch the Spanish version with English subtitles, it's a true treat!  The Spanish version is a lot longer than the English version.  I highly recommend this DVD for you.
0887307280|2.0|Although this book started out with some great ideas, by the middle I was tired of the self-promoting and sappy style. In fact, I could not read the second half at all. I tried to ignore the writing style and get to the meat, but the book was ruined by too many personal stories and pontification when I was looking for straightforward, solid business practices. Some of the basics are there, but they are hidden in a sea of mush.
0783240236|5.0|Here's a great Hitchcock thriller on DVD, full of great extras.  &quot;All About the Birds&quot; is a documentary about how the movie was made.  Watching that makes the movie just that much better, because it illustrates the true genius of Hitchcock's moviemaking.  I would highly recommend this DVD to any fan of Hitchcock.
B00003CXE7|3.0|Ridley Scott dominates the commentary track, which also features the editor and the cinematographer, offering insights into not only how scenes were shot but how the script developed and how the second act was expanded from the original draft. He also mentions Hans Zimmer's score quite often, which he was pleased with, and how it augmented intimate scenes and played a role to the extent of becoming &quot;another character in the film&quot;.  Zimmer has his own documentary on the second disc, too.  Like Wolfgang Peterson, Scott is a fascinating listen when it comes to balancing talk of his approach to directing while sharing production anecdotes from the field.  Listen for the inside joke about the two horses on Maximus' breastplate device!
0792846303|4.0|Modern filmmakers need to watch this film to learn how to make a horror film the right way.  If you like atmospherically scary movies, this is definitely worth watching.  The isolation you feel throughout the movie will leave you with chills.  The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because MGM owns the rights to the film and released it without any remastering.  My brand new videotape has the picture quality of a VHS tape that has been lying in a dusty attic for 20 years.  The 2 channel stereo sound has no bass response and sounds really harsh during loud sequences.  I wish that Anchor Bay Entertainment could get the rights to this film since they would probably use THX remastering with widescreen video and Dolby Surround.  I have read that the MGM DVD version of this film will be from a new interpositive and have picture quality like the restored version of Halloween.  Since it is coming from MGM though, it will likely not have extras such as interviews, and behind the scenes like the laserdisc had.  MGM doesn't believe in that sort of thing apparently.  Technical stuff aside, this is one of Carpenter's best films in my opinion.  It's truly a classic.
6305878323|4.0|In this day of plotlines running the speed of light, the pace of Mary Poppins is an acquired taste, but what a feast it is.  All the Sherman and Sherman songs are good; &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,&quot; &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot; and &quot;A Spoonful of Sugar&quot; cast a giant shadow, but among the others is the poignant &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; (&quot;Tuppence&quot;), a gentle hymn for charity, and a showcase for matte painter Peter Ellenshaw's beautiful renderings of St. Paul's Cathedral.  Ellenshaw and his mystical views of London in 1910 aren't meant to be literal, just imaginative, and fuse the animation elements with live action while acting as a strong character within the film.  The music and choreography are both thrilling in the chimney sweeps' production number, &quot;Step in Time&quot;.  Staged by Marc Breux and Dee Dee Wood, and inspired by Michael Kidd, it uses movie magic to augment terrific dancing.  Both &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; and &quot;Spoonful&quot; are in the third act, dishing up more visual sugar just when similar family films are winding down.  \\"The Making of Mary Poppins\\" is very good and the 1964 promo film of the world premiere at the Chinese Theater is tacky and enjoyable.  The two hour and twenty minute film seems effortless, but other 60s family films that attempted to emulate its magic fell short.  They're on DVD too, but stick with Mary.
0792846303|4.0|Modern filmmakers need to watch this film and learn.  If you like movies where the atmosphere alone is enough to scare you, this is worth watching.  The isolation you feel when watching this film is incredible.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because MGM owns the rights to this film.  My VHS copy of this film is brand new, yet the picture quality makes it seem as if the tape has been sitting up in a dusty attic for 20 years.  The picture quality is poor and the 2 channel stereo sound has no bass response and sounds harsh.  It's a shame Anchor Bay Entertainment can't release this with their typical THX widescreen and dolby surround upgrades.  I have read that the upcoming DVD version of this film will be from a new interpositive.  The picture is supposed to be as good as the restored Halloween.  Since it is coming from MGM though, don't count on it having interviews, behind the scenes, or deleted scenes.  Technical stuff aside though, this is one of Carpenter's best films in my opinion.  It's truly a classic ghost story.
B000002UA2|5.0|This disc is one that alot of people will probaly not give the time of day unless they are die hards but it is well worth the money.  Then again,  most Floyd fans are die hards so they will probably pick this up eventually if they don't already own it.  Floyd fans are different I have come to find out.  The main reason is because they are into the greatest band to ever come along.  Everyone else is listening to at best, second best.  Anyway,  &quot;Free Four&quot; which is sung by Roger is the best song on the disc but closely followed by Gilmour's rendition of &quot;Childhood's End&quot;.  The third best song has Rick Wright on vocal duty and is called &quot;Stay&quot;.  There are several instrumentals and they are really good except the last song titled &quot;Absolutely Curtains&quot; which is not much to speak of.  &quot;Free Four&quot; is along the lines of &quot;Fearless&quot; from Meddle and &quot;Childhood's End&quot; is very similiar to &quot;Time&quot; from Dark Side Of The Moon. The album will sound very nice from the first listen but a few of the songs sound similiar so you might feel like the disc is repeating itself. It isn't.  Enjoy and God bless.
0385484518|1.0|The words in this book do not do justice to the strength of heart and mind that Morrie Schwartz achieved in his last days of overcoming the mental and physical pain and anguish of his degenerative illness.  That awesome strength of will shines through with Morrie as an enduring example of how one man learned how to maintain a meaningful and interactive life despite his increasingly debilitating and humiliating illness.<br />Unfortunately, to learn of this wonderful man you have to plow through the directionless idiocy and simple minded truths and wisdom that the author drew from his Tuesday meetings with Morrie.  Instead of focusing on Morrie, you have to put up with, as another reviewer so aptly put it, the author's baby boomer guilt about his own life and such meaningless dribble as what food he brought Morrie to the weekly meetings.  This dribble is painfully revealing about the author's own self-absorbed shortcomings.  For example, it takes him weeks to discover that Morrie can no longer eat this food, which he brings as his pitiful contribution to his meetings with Morrie and his family.  Morrie obviously wanted him, not his food, yet the author takes weeks to figure this out!<br />As to the truths and wisdom of the book, surely many of us subscribe to one of the many great religions of the world that has taught many of these same truths and wisdom for hundreds, if not thousands, of years --- with far greater cohesiveness of thought and poetry of language.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Ah, yet another Beatles album - this time a collection of #1 hits!  This is a good CD but the Beatles #1 hits are by far *NOT* their best work.  Songs like &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, &quot;In My Life&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and tons of others easily top the #1 hits.  But with that aside, there are some great songs on here - that, unfortunatly, haven't been remastered as was reported before album release.  It's a great record to own, however, because of the sheer number of songs! :)
B00004XPQM|3.0|Even though this movie is rated &quot;R&quot; it seems to me that the intended audience for this film was teenagers.  The events in the film happen to high school seniors.  The plot which could have been developed into an interesting story is juvenile and when things in the movie starting getting a little intense they are alleviated with slapstick humor.<br />All of this does not make this a bad video, just not one that is intellectually stimulating.  If some of the graphic violence was edited out of the film it probably could have gotten a &quot;PG-13&quot; rating and been legally viewed by the directors intended audience.
0140277447|5.0|The book leaves the reader with many questions while describing crimes that are unthinkable.  How could the Imperial Japanese  army turn young conscripts into such bestial murderers?  We are faced with two choices: The Japanese army was so totally undisciplined that its troops ran amok;  or, the massacre and rapes had to occur with the tacit approval if not under the direct orders of the commanders up to and including the royal family.  The latter would seem to be the case if the army was as disciplined as it was reputed to be. The Japanese attacked and sank an American Naval vessel, the USS Panay during the episode.  Carefully photographed films of the sinking were smuggled out and displayed in American newsreels only after the FDR administration asked that 30 feet of the film showing planes attacking in such a way that it could only have been deliberate were removed.  Would history have been different if American ships had been &quot;savagely and deliberately attacked&quot; four years sooner than Pearl Harbor? Revisionists have blasted this book because one of the photographs shows a Japanese tank of a type that did not appear until later in the war.  These criticisms go in the same category as those who point to photographs of bombing raid victims mistaken for concentration camp victims to try to prove that Auschwitz never happened. Chang's research clearly shows that Japan was fully aware of what was going on.  Newspaper clippings from Japan even covered a beheading competition between Japanese officers. The manner in which the rape has been treated by history is an interesting study in itself.  To this day, Japanese scholars who investigate too closely do so at personal risk. How can people get molded into such killers?  Unlike the traditional approach to war crimes that places the responsibility on individuals, Ms Chang makes a compelling case that it was &quot;...a dangerous government, in a vulnerable culture, in dangerous times, able to sell dangerous rationalizations to those whose human instincts told them otherwise.&quot;  An important book.  The interested reader might also want to look into Dave Grossman's book: &quot;On Killing...&quot; for further information on how people can be induced to kill in spite of all of their moral upbringing.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Let me just start by saying, I am and always will be Korns biggest fan. They're the reason i got into Limp Bizkit. I bought their album 'Significant Other' and after listening to this CD over and over, I found it very repetitive. It now sits in the back of my CD rack only emerging so that my friends can borrow it. (In which they return the next day) While my Korn, Perfect Circle, Sunk Loto, Linkin Park and etc.. albums get constent attention. <br />Limp Bizkit's new album is sadly to say just a failed attempt at raising the average listeners heart rate to a mere walk. I got a hold of this album through a friend and am glad i never sprung the dosh. My money is better spent on Korns new upcoming album this year.<br />Not a complete washout, i gave it 3 stars. I think what the world needs is fresh music, like Linkin Park. Not the repetition that comes from the Limp.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is probably Miyazaki's last animation, he determines to make this animation the best of his works and it is a success.  The story of Princess Mononoke is simple and beautiful, Miyazaki interprets his concern of enviormental problems perfectly into the movie, that kids and even adults can actually learn something from it.  If you like this movie, I highly recommend Miyazaki's &quot;Nausicaa&quot; and &quot;Laputa&quot;.  They are Miyazaki's earlier works and my favorites.
B0000214F3|5.0|I waited so long to see this movie, but I'm so glad I finally did see it.  What I would have missed!  It was sensual, frightening, and finally romantic and moving.  I cried so hard I had puffy eyes for a whole day.  The film is gorgeous to look at in every way, has a lot to say about life, character, and time; but most of all, it's just a lovely well-acted film that satisfies in every way.  The Jamaican actress and Pitt's conversations with her are spellbinding.
B00004XONN|1.0|i really don't understand the hype about radiohead and their greatness.  my only guess is that the critics and fans raving about &quot;ok computer&quot; and &quot;kid a&quot; are doing a farely poor job exposing themselves to other music.  If any fans of these two albums had even a remotely diverse taste in music they would realize just how forced radiohead's music is.  there is such a thing as avant-garde musicians doing amazingly fresh projects.  and many of these musicians have a vision.  unfortunately these pathetic pop-stars like radiohead are trying to earn more respect than they are worth.  stick to the cute guitar loops like on the bends guys.<br />-jim
B00003CXE7|5.0|It amazes me that movies about Roman Gladiators are so few.  All the attributes that movie-makers long for; adventure, romance, action, heroism - can be found in a good Gladiator story.  This is why my surprise at the success of Gladiator is somewhat muted.<br />If anyone could put together a modern day epic such as Gladiator it would be Ridley Scott.  Through films such as Bladerunner, Thelma and Louise, and Alien, Mr. Scott has been revealed as one of our foremost storytellers.  His ability to take a conceptually challenging story and make it almost universally accessible, must surely be enviable amongst his peers.<br />Gladiator follows this tradition by taking what was once considered &quot;old news&quot; and pumping it full of modern day movie steriod.  The war sequence well surpasses anything that Mel Gibson (Braveheart, The Patriot) has yet put together and the gladiator fights are brutal but not distasteful in their depiction. <br />From the first frame to the last, I found myself enthralled at this story of a famous Roman general who, when unjustly disgraced, falls into a life of slavery.  His rise through the ranks of the Roman gladiators to a point where he can finally face his nemesis, although bloody, is treated decently.<br />Russell Crowe, who plays the part of General Maximus, is superb.  Indeed, his performance is somewhat reminiscent of Kirk Douglas's Spartacus in that the personality of the character overshadows his physicality.  Russell Crowe was a relative unknown when this movie was first filmed and if Mr. Scott ever considered this casting decision a risk then I believe he hit the jackpot.  I believe we may be watching the creation of a new superstar.<br />Other stellar performances are provided by Joaquin Phoenix, Richard Harris, and Oliver Reed (Who sadly died during the making of Gladiator).<br />Mr. Scott did not skimp on his use of technology in this movie, although this is not entirely apparent until you review the bonus features on theDVD.  In particular, the digital recreations of Rome and the Colussium are stunning.<br />I would suggest at this point that you grab your credit card and order this movie right away.  It will be one of the most welcome additions to your DVD collection this year.
B00003CXFG|4.0|I was not especially impressed with the teasers released for this movie. I just happened to rent it one day as an &quot;Oh what the heck!&quot; What a surprise I was in store for. I will not say it is a great movie, but the effects and the acting make it a very good movie. The crash sequence in the beginning is spectacular. Rhada Mitchel's performance during this sequence is outstanding. Inspite of glaring holes in the plot, the way the characters interacted and some breath taking footage carry this film. The scene where the creatures come out as the darkness settles in is well done visually. To quote Vin Diesel's character it was &quot;beautiful&quot;. The writers successfully manipulated the viewer to pull for first Hauser's character, then gradually shifted to have us rooting for Vin Diesel's character. Indeed Mitchel and Diesel are what set this movie apart from being just another weak attempt at sci fi horror. Their performances are no less than outstanding. I think if  you liked Alien, and the Thing, you will like this one.
0811826848|5.0|The world will never forget the Beatles.   No other band will ever be as good, and no other duo will write songs as good as those written by John Lennon and Paul Mcartney.  When the Beatles first emerged in the 60's, something changed.  This book is an incredible tribute, which is written and presented beautifully with engaging text and amazing images.  This book should find a place in the home of every Beatles fan, and it should be passed down through the generations for them to enjoy.
B0000399WI|5.0|I missed this movie in the theaters and I missed a great movie. I am very happy to see it come to DVD. The story on the surface is about a friendship between two inmates in Shawshenk Prison. Underneath that story is a story about perseverance, and hope. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give stellar preformances here. The movie for me worked on so many levels, while it was criticized for being too long, I, didn't want it to end. I wanted to know what happened to these characters. The DVD transfer is great and I highly recomend this film for everyone. My only complaint is that it was not a special edition. Mr Darabont is a talented and gifted director and I would like to know more about what he was thinking when he made the Shawshenk Redemption.
0375500901|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. Daniel Silva has surpassed himself. What a wonderful read, this thriller. And so topical: the Middle East figures centrally.
B000050XEI|4.0|After listening to this CD for the first time, I find myself asking one question.  How is it possible to create a sound that is so unbelievably beautiful, haunting and ethereal all at the same time?  The answer is quite simple.  Because it's Enya. Need I say more?  From the upbeat track Wild Child to the instrumental Silver Inches, this work is vintage Enya.  The formula may be the same, but why mess with success?  True, it is shorter then most which is somewhat disappointing, but after having waited for five years since her release of The Memory of Trees, I'm not complaining. If you are bothered by the CD's relatively short length, place it in your player on repeat. That should more then make up for it.  How sweet it is......
B0000000LI|3.0|Yanni's setup points to a much higher level of musicianship and composition than his music actually achieves. Yanni brings together perhaps the world's finest studio and chamber music musicians to perform an eclectic style of music that seeks to combine classical, rock, jazz and synthesizer music (sometimes called &quot;world music&quot;) sounds great huh? so where does Yanni fail? <br />first off, Yanni's compositions all follow a very rigid format which goes something like slow melodic classical introduction (usually the best part of the song), followed by a series of solos on different instruments (violin, keyboard, flute etc) and climaxing in an ubrupt and upbeat ending. this gets old. also, if you have ever seen the accompanying video, Yanni looks quite phoney at times because at all times he's pumping his fists and smiling broadly like a baby with gas. this would be ok if he only did it sparingly at the climax or other key moments of his songs but by doing it throughout it just looks staged. <br />with all these great musicians on one stage and with the supposed musical freedom they're supposed to have in this fusion setting, the music could be a whole lot better. as presented, it's only mediocre.
B000003S2K|5.0|I've been into Tangerine Dream for several years now, and finally decided to branch out a bit in my current ambient music obsession.  I've found several remarkable ambient albums in my recent search, and this one probably tops the list.<br />I can put this CD on, press repeat, and have hours of music that doesn't grate on my nerves or get repetitive.  Every time I hear &quot;Ambient 1: Music For Airports,&quot; I hear something new.  And the songs are so simple!<br />Being a software developer, I have to concentrate, so I like to have music that doesn't get in my face or force me to sing with it.  Ambient music is perfect to code to, and this Eno CD is perfect for me.
B000002UAU|5.0|At this writing, 400+ reviews of this album have shown up.  Some say: &quot;A time element of history... if you don't dig it, you're missing the boat!&quot; (5 stars).  Some even say: &quot;I think most of you who praise this album just like it because somebody told you to... the production, the harmonies, the musicianship, and the lyrics are way out of date in this current day and age.&quot; (1 star).  Whether you like Sgt. Pepper or not (or have even heard it or not), people are still listening and still buying.<br />&quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is probably the most complex song here (written mainly by John Lennon).  Lyrically, it gathers information about things John read in the newspaper (a car crash, 4000 holes in Lanchashire), features some fine orchestral buildup by George Martin, the jaunty middle-8th written by Paul McCartney, and the final long coda.  You have to remember that this was performed and produced on 4-track (not 16 or 32).  John's songs include &quot;Mr. Kite&quot; (with lyrics taken from an old circus poster and John and Mr. Martin playing organ parts and splicing in old steam organ sounds to give the impression of a real circus).  John's other songs range from surrealistic &quot;Lucy in the Sky&quot; to silly but entertaining &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning&quot; (probably the funniest song with its barnyard sounds at the end).  Paul's songs range from Baroque: &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; (performed with strings and harp), 1920's vaudeville &quot;When I'm 64&quot; (the surviving Fab 3 are getting close to that age), the psychedellic &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot;, humorous character songs like &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, and rock and roll &quot;Getting Better&quot; (John helped with the lyrics on the last verse).  George Harrison's sole track is the India raga &quot;Within You Without You&quot; (performed with a sitar, a tabla, and an orchestra).  Ringo Starr's sole song &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; (written by John and Paul for Ringo) sums up what his position was like in the Beatles.  Sgt. Pepper is more of a personal statement of where each of the Beatles were at the time than a concept album.  John points out the only true concept on the album was the title track where Sgt. Pepper and Billy Shears are introduced before &quot;With a Little Help&quot; and the &quot;Sgt. Pepper Reprise&quot;.  &quot;But it worked because we said it would work!&quot;<br />Ok, so that explains what I like about Sgt. Pepper as a whole.  Listen for yourself if you never have.
B000001GQT|5.0|Recorded in the Jesus-Christus-Kirche in Berlin in 1972 and 1973, Herbert von Karajan's interpretations of these essential Richard Strauss works are among the best available. Although he receives criticism for his interpretations of other composers, Karajan is a near-undisputed master of Strauss (with whom he shared similar musical aesthetics). Although his 1959 and 1960 London/Decca recordings of the same works with the Vienna Philharmonic are also excellent (and also available at a reasonable price), this recording has a bit more atmosphere.<br />Unfortunately, due to its fame, the very familiar introduction of &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; overshadows other wonderful sections of Strauss' grand tone poem, including the waltz-like \\"Tanzlied.\\" Although the introduction is (of course) played with appropriate grandeur and majesty, Karajan and the Berliners make the rest of this work equally memorable. <br />This recording also features two of Strauss' most famous tone poems, including the impish &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot; and passionate &quot;Don Juan.&quot; Although the former runs the inherent risk of forced humor (the chaos Till creates at the marketplace, the \\"gross grimace\\" Till makes at self-important scholars), I've found that a less literal listening of the work makes it more enjoyable; one does not feel compelled to laugh, sit-com like, at canned humor. Barring these personal reservations about this aspect of the work, Karajan and the Berliners play wonderfully. They particularly work best in the sections when Till feels full of himself after the merriment, misery, and mischief he has created, followed immediately by his trial and execution; in this recording, the judges all sound like humorless, fascistic bullies next to poor Till's pleas; that he was \\"having a little fun.\\"   <br />A perennial favorite of Karajan's, and featured in his first-ever professional concert at the age of 20, the Berliners give a rapturous account of &quot;Don Juan.&quot; In this work, Karajan has few peers (Rudolf Kempe's unaffected approach, recorded at approximately the same time, provides some of the closest competition). Horns thrust, kettledrums pound, strings sigh sweetly... The orchestra climaxes many times, with moments of profound sensual languor... I can think of no other compelling explanations to recommend this interpretation of Strauss' first major masterpiece. Worth the price of the recording alone.<br />Also worth the price of the recording is the \\"Dance of the Seven Veils\\" from Strauss' infamous opera &quot;Salome,&quot; another favorite of Karajan's. This is a work lodged firmly between syrupy Romanticism and cruel Modernism, a dichotomy that melds into a truly special musical experience. For those unfamiliar with the rest of Strauss' revolutionary opera, this dance that Salome performs for her stepfather may whet the appetites of potential lovers of the opera (as it did for me). Karajan's sinewy interpretation of this orchestral piece builds to a wondrously frenzied climax, though with less feline sensuality than his 1960 recording with the Vienna Philharmonic.<br />The combination of Karajan and Strauss creates a dangerous magic. So, without reservation, I highly recommend this recording to hardcore Straussians, as well as novices to the composer's aural wonders.
B00004RF9B|4.0|Great movie, but it had a bad master. This release had various dust particles on it, cracks and pops in the audio, scenes in the movie that jumped (from a bad cut and paste job and which included a nice pop sound), and towards the end of the movie there were some &quot;change the reel reminders&quot; (you know, those black splotches that appear in the upper right corner of the movie for a second or two to remind the guy behind the projector to queue up the next reel). Hopefully this movie will be re-released this for a 50th anniversary with a &quot;restored&quot; master.
0446677450|3.0|I had very high expectations for this book given the positive nature of the reviews and its position on the NY Times bestseller list.  This definitely magnified my disappointment.  I'm writing this review for experienced wealth creators.  I think this is a lightbulb type of book for many people who are just beginning to think about how to make money.  Experienced investors and business owners will be bored with the contents.<br />Much of the material is presented in a dialogue format between the author and his rich father.  I found the format to be tedious.  I kept saying to myself &quot;just get to the point&quot;.  I also found myself craving more detail about specific investments he entered into to make his money.  I enjoyed Millionaire Next Door because of that detail, not because I learned a lot of new ideas.  In certain examples he imparts this information.  In many more he remains vague on the topic.<br />I own a 10-unit apartment building and have read a number of books on real estate investing (how the author made the majority of his money).  I found Rich Dad, Poor Dad to be similar in tone to some of Cook's real estate investing books.  A lot of self-congratulation and much talk about the homeruns.  Unfortunately you're always left to wonder exactly what the admitted failures were.  The author states that much learning takes place even in these instances, so tell us more about them, please.<br />I do not disagree with any concepts presented in the book.  He has a very clever way of presenting and thinking about assets, liabilities and cash flow if these are confusing subjects for you.  He also drives home the point that you'll never be wealthy by spending your energy working for someone else.  If you're like me, you probably don't want to take the chance you're passing up some worthwhile knowledge.  It's a quick read and a cheap book, if your expectations are realistic you might enjoy it more than I did.
052594527X|5.0|What a beautiful story!  Every word of this book was flawless.  Tracy Chevalier has an incredible capacity for blending well-thought-out, creative fiction with 'what could have been.'  Easy but captivating reading.  What a pleasure.  Very evocative of Dutch life in the l7th century, with its strict social hierarchy.  The subtly suggestive romance was a breath of fresh air in this era where nothing is left to the imagination.  This book can be rated 'G' for its decency and delicacy, but appeals to a mature person's experience, intelligence, sensibility and wisdom.   This book is good for the soul.
B0000019HU|5.0|I bought this record, like many others, on the basis of all the great reviews it's received.  i wasn't sure what to expect, but the first track, &quot;breadcrumb trail&quot; blew me away.  i haven't heard more original rock music since i bought &quot;ride the fader&quot; by chavez.  as a guitarist, slint's songs are even more ingenious after you know how to play them.  this record is dark, intense, and not danceable in the slightest.  those looking for lighter stuff, spare yourselves.  but for a truly unique classic, click &quot;buy.&quot;
B00000J9HF|5.0|Giulini unveils this work as no other with the silvery tones of the Vienna Philharmonic. Cappuccilli's extraordinary musicianship in the title role and Domingo's suave and cheeky Duke would steal the show if it wasn't for Cotrubas' definitive Gilda.  Her captivating innocence and sweetness of tone have made this one of my favourite opera recordings.  The music itself is very accessible even by Verdi standards. No regrets here.
B00004Z459|4.0|i just got this CD a few days ago, and already i'm addicted. though it's not especially original or complex music, i'm spellbound. somehow, the simple but intense blend of lyrics, catchy rhythms, and pure raw energy just reels me in. i'd recommend this to any rock or rap lover... it's one of the best blends of both worlds i've ever heard. i personally hate rap, and most rap-metal, but this band seems to have the talent to pull it off well. also, the band's dj has that rare talent of adding to the music, not making it fruity and irritating. i hope linkin park continues this beautiful energy in many albums to come.
B00004XOWM|3.0|I think this album is a good cd and bad at the same time. there are some satisfactory songs like The MI2 theme and both rollin's are great jams to listen to. Hot dog is a contraversial track in my prospective. It is good because the music really goes through ure body and you understand what fred means about the world. Its bad because fred is a little overboard on the f-word. The album isnt a total loss for there are good songs on it, i just wouldnt spend time waiting around for it like I did.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Well, Insomniac was dissappointing, Nimrod, was just dumb, but this... Warning is a great album which proves that even Green Day can grow up and mature a bit.  Songs like Minority, Blood Sex and Booze, and the title track itself really are shining examples of this band's evolution.  I recommend this album not only to Green Day fans, but to all alternative fans, and even those who wouldn't call themselves alternative fans but who are a bit more daring, I urge you to at least check out the sample clips.  Way to go Green Day!
B000001F3C|4.0|Not as good, for sure, as &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; but good nonetheless. Really 4 1/2 stars. If war could be eradicated, done with, gone, just by listening to songs about the sadness, loss of innocent lives, unneccessary hatred and violence, then this album would have suceeded. The lyrics can make your hair stand up, give you goosebumps and make you wish for peace everywhere. This album was a good political statement against war...too bad it wasn't taken seriously.
6305508550|5.0|A must-see for anyone that has ever worked in a cubicle environment, hated work, got pissed-off at a printer, hates the boss, or feels trapped in a deadend job. The deliberate humor slaps you in the face from the get-go and continues to do so throughout the entire film. If you need a good laugh to forget the stress of your crappy job, then you need to see this movie.
B00003CXE7|3.0|This was a good movie to watch on DVD but some of these reviews are ridiculous.  There is a reason why this movie didn't win any awards.  It's just not that great.  It was an interesting story with some good action scenes but overall it is just another action movie.  Crowe did a great job in his part but this was certainly no Braveheart.  If you havent seen it you should, but its not going to change your life or anything.
0399146253|2.0|I had given up buying my own copies of Cornwall's books after years of waiting with bated breath for her books to come out. I now can wait for them from the library. The last couple of books, especially &quot;Black Notice&quot;, left me flat and seriously considering not to read any more of this author's works. However, being 'faithful' to my authors, I did read &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; and enjoyed the fact that everything that seemed to be left 'dangling' in Black Notice seemed to be clarified. I read Last Precinct in a few days; however, I still feel that she is portraying her characters as being very shallow. Just when I think I am going to get &quot;into&quot; Marino or Lucy, Cornwall quickly pushes them out of my grasp. I'd like to see her go 'beyond' calling Marino on his cell, beyond 'hoping' Lucy will be there for her....get some &quot;umph&quot; in her writing. Frankly, it doesn't bother me that I won't see another Cornwall book for the next 2 years. Pity!
B000001EXB|5.0|I find this album to be very interesting lyrically as well as musically. Some of the songs took 2 or 3 listens before I liked them, but now I do for sure, and I love the whole album. I bought it originally for the beautiful song &quot;Something about the way you look tonight&quot; and am so glad I did.  I mean, where else would you get to see a painting of Elton dressed up as Whistlers Mother?
B00004Z4WR|1.0|Let me start off by saying I hate Bruckheimer movies.<br />Given that, I was still willing to give it a go because I LOVE cars, and I LOVE action movies. Hey! Cars *and* action! My kind of movie! I've never been one to listen to critics when it comes to action movies. I don't watch them expecting Oscar caliber performances or great dialogue. I watch them to have a good time.<br />Well, I hated this movie. I was literally counting down the minutes, praying for it to end. <br />There *are* lots of cool cars in this movie. Too bad each one is on screen for about 3 seconds as they are loaded into the back of trailers! Basically, you get to see one cool car, the Shelby, in one long chase. If this movie has any redeeming qualities, it is that chase. However, its not even good enough to make up for having to sit through this garbage.<br />I didn't even find the engine noises to be anything special.
0800128052|5.0|This movie is simply superb.  Having played and coached football, this movie really hits home.  This is not simply a movie about football though.  Its the story of a boy and his dream.  I could watch this movie over and over again with no problem.  The music was fantastic as well. I can honestly say this is the first movie I've ever seen where the soundtrack has such an impact.  It is also one of the only movies that have actually made me cry.  The last scene is such a great climax to an amazing movie.  A very moving picture that everyone could enjoy.
B00003A9QI|5.0|Well, Rachel Portman has done it again! And this tops her outstanding list of scores! Her simple yet, beautiful score for &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is a stirring, and touching work of art! Her recurring theme will bring tears to the eyes of those who were enchanted with the film, as I was! As soon as I saw the movie, I had to have the cd! I went directly from the theatre, to the record store to buy it! And I listened to my favorite track, the first one in my car on the way back to the theatre to see the movie again! This is a must have for any classical music lover! Portman does amazingly well with a piano, and a string quartet to bring the movie to life in our minds! Get it today, you will NOT regret it!
B000002MTU|5.0|What a treat to have a blues album by Eric Clapton. He was influenced by the blues as everyone knows, but has never had a complete blues album until this one. More of a tribute to his favourite blues artists than anything else, Clapton seems to pull each song right out of his soul. Some reviewers have rated him low, because they say he is not a real blues player...duh! Clapton can play the blues as well as anyone,..just because he didn't grow up in the southern U.S. doesn't mean he can't do it just as well. Just listen to his guitar work. Maybe the only thing he doesn't have is the accent...well he is English!! So sue him!
0525945636|3.0|It starts out like a Hitchcock film with a man waking up devoid of any memory or knowledge of his past or present and he has to piece his memory together while saving the space program in pretty short order.  But I agree with previous reviewers in that Follett needed to spend a little more time on the previous life discovery process (maybe 200-300 pages more) because by rushing it he relied on too many coincidences and snap realizations.  <br />I will say that I did enjoy the read and it kept my interest because I wanted to see how it ended but he has done better.  Check the book out from the library or borrow it from a friend, there are better books to purchase.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|What a waste of time and money. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie when it reached video and when I did it was a real let down. How this movie made so much money? Well, I do know, there are more idiots in the world than there have ever been. I did laugh a couple of times, but there was too much emphasis on sex, and was pretty gross at times. None of the class and clever thoughts of the Airplane series or the first Naked Gun. The Wayans tried too hard. Nothing was suttle in this movie. They had to push it down your throat to make you think it was funny. Even my girlfriends brother, who laughs at anything, barely laughed more than 2-3 times. Don't touch this one! Leave it on the shelf!
B00003CWTI|1.0|I thought this movie was god awful. I sincerely enjoyed Anderson's &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, so I was very excited about this movie and wanted to like it. No chance. It bored me to tears. Seriously, can anyone tell me they enjoyed the 3+ hours that led up to the ridiculous ending of this movie? C'mon! The dialogue is tedious and it just tries way too hard. I have no problem with a movie that really has no sensible conclusion or plot, but it's got to be compelling and at least say something along the way. This stinks!
B00003CXE7|5.0|\\"Gladiator\\" has and will change Crowe's status as an actor... FOREVER. \\"Gladiator\\" is an epic tale up there with Mel Gibson's \\"Braveheart\\", Al Pacino's \\"Godfather\\" or Arnold Schwarzenegger's \\"Terminator\\". A wonderful tale (as the preview/trailer states) of a General who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, and a gladiator who defied an emperor. This is a big budget action/drama with a cast of thousands. Accompanying Crowe's wonderful acting was Joaquin Phoenix (he should have won the Oscar best supporting actor) as Commodus, Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, Oliver Reed (RIP) as Proximo, and Richard Harris (RIP) as the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Big sets and lots of help from today's computer technology. Director Ridley Scott spared no expense in making this movie. Disc 2 features commentaries, an HBO making of, deleted scenes, photo galleries, behind the scenes featurettes, and more. Plenty of blood sport and coliseum battle scenes, sword wielding and perils of the Roman/Greek times. * Warning - may not be suitable for youngsters.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Rarely do you get a movie that has it all,story,acting  (Russell Crowe &amp; Joaquin Phoenix are fantastic!)picture, &amp; sound all Top Class ! No doubt the best movie of 2000.
0553106635|5.0|Without a doubt the best fantasy novel I have read in many years.  This 3rd installment of the A Song of Ice and Fire series is actually better than the first two novels.  What makes this series so remarkable compared to any novel or series in any genre is it's brutally realistic character development and unique plot progression.<br />As far as characters are concerned, there is no absolute distinction between good and evil characters.  &quot;Good&quot; characters aren't the pure paladin or innocent maiden we have become accustomed too while many of the &quot;evil&quot; characters seem more honorable than the good characters.<br />Plot progression is virtually impossible to foretell.  Several times during the course of this book I was completely surprised at what I had just read.  And with the apparent rule that no character is safe from death this makes for refreshing reading.  Unlike that &quot;other&quot; series, there is plenty of action and side plots actually contribute to the overall story.  Brilliantly written.  I can't applaud Martin enough.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|With every respect given to the genius of Gene Kelly, the Amazon editorial review that says &quot;The seven tracks (on SELMASONGS) sound like something straight out of a Gene Kelly movie,&quot; is absurd.   SELMASONGS is 100% Bjork and if you like her other albums, you'll like this one, too.   DANCER IN THE DARK is an entirely new kind of musical film, using modern music within the framework of the story, instead of wrapping a story around sudden bursts into song.   A must-see and a must-hear.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Warning, just like all 5 other Green Day cds, is awesome, but it's very different. If you only like Green Day for the Dookie/Kerplunk/Insomniac typed stuff, you won't like this at all! But if you're like me(you appreciate just about any kind of music and like to see bands change their format every once in a while), you'll enjoy this. My favorite songs are Warning, Church on Sunday, Castaway, Minority, &amp; Macy's Day Parade.
0800141660|5.0|If you enjoy period pieces, this movie is excellent on all levels.  Great filming, great costumes, excellent story, and the incomparable Emma Thompson (and Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and more, to boot)!  You can't go wrong with this one (unless you want dark, dreary, violent, bloody, mawkish sentimentality and the like.)<br />This is a beautiful and compelling movie...even guys should like it, assuming you can get them to sit still long enough to get into it.
B00004XONN|5.0|As is the case with all of Radiohead's albums, this one is definately an example of a universe crumbling and disentegrating into something new and scarier. &quot;Idioteque&quot; is probably the best representation of this concept, because it has Yorke rambling about the Ice Age coming and monsters, backed by an Aphex Twin style techno composition. Meantime, all of the songs take you on a journey through sometimes nightmarish, sometimes mystical soundscape dimensions composed by new/old electronics and various instruments-kind of like the pioneer of ambient music, Brian Eno. &quot;The National Anthem&quot; is by far one of the wildest and most experimentative on the set, considering it goes off in insane horn arrangements. The best songs in my opinion are the depressingly mellow &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot; and the driven rocker &quot;Optimistic&quot;, although it's hard to find a favorite because they are all rich with atmosphere and emotion. Clearly a good soundtrack for dreaming. Yorke's fragmented style of writing backs this up further-when we are dreaming, we sometimes here people talking, but they tend to talk in incomprehensible riddles. Perhaps that is what he is trying to express here. So flip on this album, stare at the distorted digital art in the booklet, and prepare to be taken away.
0399146253|4.0|I especially liked the first part of The Last Precinct in that the reader finally gets to know a lot more of the insides of Kay Scarpetta.  I really felt like I was on the way to knowing about why Kay reacts the way she does.  Many readers resent that The Last Precinct retells the story of Black Notice, but being as how the I read the two books a year apart, I was grateful for the refresh.  <br />The final third of the book is definitely contrived and it appears that PC is trying to wrap it up as best she can.  There are too many loose ends that are tied up too quickly.  By the 2nd to last chapter, I wasn't sure if Kay was telling her story from the grave or from the witness stand.  <br />I get the feeling that Kay Scarpetta is going to embark on a new career - one in New York with Lucy at her side.  I am looking forward to the chapter in PC's life.
B00003CXE7|4.0|My sons thought this a great movie...but I found it too dark for my tastes.  I also wanted it set in an earlier Rome...but had to settle for the completely degenerate Rome near the end of the empire.  Oh, well.<br />The acting was excellent; much of the photography was stunning.  The coliseum was fantastic...though much of the fight scenes were too much in the style of an Oliver Stone movie...weird camera angles and abrupt cuts combined to make the viewer disoriented (and, I'm sure, that was the director's intent)...but I could have done with about half as much of it.<br />Well worth seeing...even twice...but I'm not sure its worth buying.

B00003CWL6|3.0|OK...so stop reading if you loved this movie.  Personally, I just don't see that it is that special.  Some scenes are good; a few are memorable...but it's been about two months since I watched the DVD and I CANNOT REMEMBER the beginning, end or much of the middle of the movie.  Somehow, it didn't stick, and my mind must have been drifting.<br />I'm not an afficionado of dark comedy...and this is such a film.  I found nothing to much appreciate in nearly all the characters...and some of them (like the father/marine with homophobia) are such cardboard, two-dimensional stereotypes that nothing they do is memorable...you've seen it all before in real life or in the movies.  There just isn't anything new here.<br />Don't waste much money on this one...just rent it if you feel the need to see it.  About the only thing of interest is seeing the actress who played the little girl in Disney's Hocus Pocus playing a typical tormented teen in this movie.
B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead falls into the much-admired category of progressive, alt-rock. Kid A cements their reputation as a forward-moving, creative powerhouse. Any band that seeks to change and reinvent  their music by exploring new sounds, techniques and goals, and by not following trends and same-old-sounds, gets automatically put on my A-list. The goal heard here on this CD is not commercial success. However, with the amount of praise heaped on this band, commercial success is only a by-product of the superior sounds created here. Though the title track sounds like a MIDI project I did in university, thankfully here it sounds much, much better. The chugging deep bass heard on &quot;The National Anthem&quot; fits perfectly with the horns - coming off as funky and completely enjoyable. The haunting atmosphere of &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot; is deeply affecting and mezmerizing.  The best chance for the mainstream to hear this group can best be displayed on &quot;Optimistic&quot;, the only truly lyrical melodic track on the CD. The bottom line here is that the fresh, unique, brilliant sounds created here are an absolute joy to listen to. Great stuff.
B00004U8H4|5.0|American Psycho is a great movie.  This review is for those who are having a hard time deciding between buying new (unrated) or just picking up a used one at Blockbuster.<br />The unrated just adds more sex in the 3 some scene.  It does not add any violence.<br />If i had it to do over, I would buy the cheaper version.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Just in time for the holidays and a whole new generation of Beatle fans. After a series of Anthologies and a huge book, this collection of #1's made it's way into store without revealing it's true purpose. Defending a Beatle music record. A UK pop boy group Westlife was poised to break a record set by the Beatles so many years ago. Nobody could step forward to knock the would-be record breakers from the chart, except for the Beatles themselves. Slick manuever wouldn't you say? Sure the collection is pure gold, it has been test marketed for decades now! I was sad when I found out that &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; wasn't on the Cd but completely emotionally destroyed when my cousin told me that he heard a rumor that the Beatles are going to break-up. I hope he meant the Bangles.
B00003CXDU|4.0|This flick accomplishes something pretty cool -- it gently pokes fun at various sci-fi cliches, yes, but it manages to also stay true to the kind of heroic and humane storylines that made shows like Star Trek such a cult favorite in the first place. It kind of has its cake and eats it, too -- which is no mean feat.<br />The pace is very nimble and the cast is great. (Seriously, why can't Alan Rickman be in *every* movie made? He's so darn watchable.) <br />&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is highly recommended to anyone looking for a laugh. You don't even need to be a sci-fi fan to get it.
0784011206|5.0|Some people merely regard &quot;First Blood&quot; and the entire Rambo series as brainless, macho action movies. Nothing could be further from the truth. Though the first movie emphasizes it the most, John Rambo is a symbol of many brave men who fought for their country in the politician's war known as Vietnam. &quot;First Blood&quot; shows the reality of how many of the men were treated when they came home, and how it was often difficult to cope with the training and things they'd endured in the war. There's no sugar-coating in David Morrell's outstanding novel, or the movie itself. Rambo is targeted by biggotry from the beginning by town sheriff Will Teasle, played superbly by Brian Dennehy. When he fights back, it's the way the government trained him to: no holds barred and violent. When you watch &quot;First Blood&quot;, try to look past the action for a second and see the human factor it portrays....a factor that is very real.
0380788624|5.0|Cryptonomicon is a literary experience that smacks of a favored vacation or the temporary company of remarkable individual. The ideas, the humor, the plotlines all travel at the speed of the internet. This is an epic spanning the globe and history in the most marvelously constructed fashion. <br />Those that enjoy to read will be best served if they enter without any pre-concieved notion as to what they are about to experience. With time the very distinct cadence of Stephenson's writing will grow easier to absorb. The shifts in time will occur without any awkwardness, and the progression of the story; addictive. <br />I have envy for those that have yet to read this book. Though I don't doubt there is much to be gathered by a second or third read, it is the first journey that will leave you breathless.
B00000I8NC|5.0|GYBE!'s half hour EP offers more in that slim time period than most current rock bands do in a career. the first track by the canadian collective, Moya, follows the usual pattern of a GYBE! song, using swirling strings and subdued percussion to engulf the listener, building both the momentum and intensity as instruments join in and the tempo quickens to one of GYBE!'s best musical climaxes. Blaise Bailey Finnegan III uses samples from the paranoid conspiracy theorist heard on the last album, yet instead of merely creating an interesting introduction for the song, it acts a bizarre kind of lyric. his disturbing poem rambles on top of a vaguely menacing rhythm, which explodes soon after Finnegan finishes talking into what seems to be an orchestral expression of his internal chaos or perhaps his view of the future.<br />a really fabulous ep
1563894696|5.0|I will not make this long because if you have not read this, you need to right now.  This comic book stands out in my mind as one of the finest things I have ever read.  Tim Sale's art looks awkward at first, but you will soon realize that his style somehow tells a story without words.  Sale is brilliant.  <br />Jeph Loeb continues to be outstanding as this is a thriller.  It is a mystery with the great Batman that you won't be able to put down.  <br />I have read this multiple times and passed it around to friends of mine at the office and they love it.<br />Give it a try, you will love it!
B00003CXE7|3.0|I very much enjoyed the visual mastery of this film.  Scott's direction, as always, is top-notch.  Cinematography, art direction, costumes . . . everything visual about this film is dead-on.  Unfortunately the movie too often slips into passages of such extremely grotesque violence that my enjoyment of the film was diminished.  Also distracting is a storyline which lacks depth and originality.<br />This is not a bad film by any means.  It is certainly an accurate depiction of what life may have been like for a Roman Gladiator.  I'm just not sure it's something I needed to see in such gory detail.<br />The true gem in this film, along with superior visuals, is the amazing performance of Joaquin Phoenix.
0380729407|5.0|I read the book for a school project. One night while reading it I read over 100 pages in one sitting just because of the suspense at the end of each chapter. Great read, buy it.
6302732875|1.0|I feel like I was the one who was scammed!  This movie is about whiney old men...and each one says the &quot;F&quot; word more often than the one before him.  &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; it is NOT!  More like &quot;Death of Some More Time&quot;
B00003CWL6|5.0|I always enjoy reading the reviews of controversial books and films.  The ones that entertain me the most are those in which the reviews claims that those who enjoyed the movie are demented, that any sane or intelligent person would have hated the film, that the true intelligentsia would despise it.<br />Naturally, American Beauty got quite a few such reviewers.  I humbly disagree with them.<br />This movie is, in my opinion, sheer genius.  I was captivated by Kevin Spacey's opening monologue, and hardly blinked throughout the rest of the film, except to blink back tears during Spacey's closing speech.  The music is almost hypnotic; the pacing is perfect.  Scenes are as beautiful as paintings, and symbolism is rife.  I've watched the movie five times now, and haven't tired of it.  There's always something more to discover, another layer of meaning to be unraveled.<br />The acting is not perfect.  I agreed with the Academy's decision not to give Annette Bening the Oscar; and while Kevin Spacey was brilliant, the three adolescents all had &quot;off&quot; moments.  But this is such a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.  I was so captivated by the overall impact of the film that I didn't even notice until a later viewing.<br />Borrow it, rent it, or buy it.  This is a must-see.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden's most recent album, Affirmation, has to be the best album I have ever heard (and I have heard a lot!).  Their music is just astounding.  The words are so emotionally moving, and when they are put together with beautiful harmonies, the product is just too amazing for words.  The Australian duo, which consists of singer/songwriter Darren Hayes and instrumentalist Daniel Jones, write their own music, which shows a huge amount of talent.  Not to mention that Darren's aching falsetto is SO amazingly beautiful and Daniel is very talented at playing whatever instrument is needed.  Whether you liked their self-titled debut album or not, you will undoubtedly love this one.  I would rate this 100 stars if I could, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone.
0061002860|5.0|Published in 1926, somewhat before Christie's creative peak in the mid-1930's to mid 1940's, this ranks as one of her best mystery novels.  And in fact, it's my favorite Poirot mystery.  Murder on the Orient Express tends to steal the spotlight, but in my opinion Ackroyd is better written and much more realistic; more character-driven and less plot-driven.<br />Why is it so highly acclaimed?  Any number of reasons.  The casual style, the colorful depiction of the villagers, the brilliant (and very funny) mah jongg scene, Poirot's vegetable-marrow-throwing antics, and of course, the extraordinary conclusion.  Speaking of which, the usual warnings apply.  I haven't revealed the identity of the murderer, but keep in mind that other reviewers haven't been so kind.  However, this novel is a classic that can be appreciated even if you already know the ending.<br />If you read only one Christie, make it this one!
6300247376|5.0|Great movie!  Loosely based on the true story of Albert Johnson.  As in most cases the two are practically totally different.  The movie is good, and the real-life man hunt of Albert Johnson is a great read.  For those whom have seen the movie, The real Albert Johnson also walked away from his cabin when it was blown up!     If anyone can tell where I can get ahold of the Theme music to this movie, &quot;For You&quot;, or want to know more about the book of the real Albert Johnson please Email me.  Hwoods01@yahoo.com
B00003CX6P|5.0|If you love homoerotica, or you love heavy films, this is the flick for you! The story is fascinating and Ripley is played to perfection by Matt Damon (although it appears very few of the reviewers on here would agree with that), but really, Jude Law as Dickie steals the show! He gave one helluva performance-- one I won't soon forget. Heck, the whole movie is unforgettable, and it really makes you think, which is what a good movie should do. And all that homoerotica...mmm-mmm-mmm! I was just beside myself with joy and laughter to see all this steamy interaction between the attractive men in this film. Yeah, 5 stars, baby!
B00000K19E|5.0|Initially, I was not interested in watching this movie at all.  However, once I was finally coersed into watching it, I fell in love!  This is a wonderful film!  The characters, the actors, the effects:  they are all amazing!  Buy the DVD!  The special features are awesome!  The behind-the-scenes documentary is great!  And the commentary version of the film was very refreshing after having watched the theatrical version a few dozen times.  I highly recommend this movie and am very anxious to see what the Wachowski brothers do with the next two pieces of this trilogy.
1559409002|4.0|I had never heard of Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS before playing this Criterion DVD. I was a little bit reluctant because a lot of movies have been recently released in the DVD standard claiming a cult status they don't deserve. But CARNIVAL OF SOULS undoubtedly has a place in this collection and should regain a new popularity among movie lovers.<br />Of course, the movie at times could be confused with a TWILIGHT ZONE episode but Herk Harvey's camera is a lot more creative and innovative than the television cameras of Rod Serling. Our new horror movies screenwriters and directors are after all not sheer geniuses, they steal a lot of their ideas from such movies as THE CARNIVAL OF SOULS. Even the so praised SIXTH SENSE doesn't seem so original after a screening of Herk Harvey's movie.<br />An excellent musical score, good actors and the stunning visual ideas of Herk Harvey are going to convince you that CARNIVAL OF SOULS deserves a place of choice in Movie History.<br />An anti-BLOB DVD.
055321277X|5.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is more than a book of suspense and horror, but it makes you think of things that relate to life.<br />You have to read this book for yourself because it contaplates from &quot;what others have heard about the story&quot;. Here you have a human being that has split himself into two different personalities. One is a man of conscience and the other one is this man who has a taste for evil. The &quot;potion&quot; created by compounding together reactive chemcials makes Dr. Jykell become depended on it, and he has also indulge himself in his evil twisted side. <br />When Jykell quoted, &quot;that man has two sides&quot; (which is good and evil), I think that Stevenson demostrated well within the character that he made a point to what he did and what he had become. That is when he changes from Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde that he was only pulling out what man chooses to be. <br />This shows that man has a choice to be good or evil. But what makes Dr. Henry Jekyll case so unsual is that he creates a formula, a formula that he becomes addicted to, and he can no longer transform back from evil to good. He was premanently becoming Edward Hyde, someone he never thought that he had the capablity of being. Discovering the potion seem like his worse nightmare.<br />And it was.
0684853523|5.0|Wow.  I guess I'm reviewing this more from my point of view than from the average reader.  It reminded me of why I wanted to be a writer in the first place.  Its very easy to get caught up in todays ultra-information age and get side-tracked, but King brings it all back.<br />To those who think the writing mechanics portion was too short, you should be writing, writing, and writing some more, not looking for quick fixes in a how-to book.  Besides its much easier to remember short, helpful hints than memorize pages of rules and regulations.<br />'nuff said... time to write
1568497369|5.0|I'm a junior in highschool.  My Modern Lit. class had to read this book.  It was great.  I normally hate the novels we are required to read in school, but I liked this one.  I liked it a lot.
B00004T37H|5.0|This may be the best movie ever made.  I'm serious.  It's incredibly gorgeous, emotionally moving, philosophically complex, absolutely mythic, with a mix of animation styles that shouldn't work together but do.  I was completely mesmerized for over two hours -- didn't look at my watch once.  Not the first time, not the second time, not the third, not the fourth.  I don't buy videos, but this one I'm buying.
0899664474|4.0|When I read this book and it caught my atenion really fast. It started with the Siddhartha sun bathing near the river bank. He is the handsome son of the Brahmin. After that it talked about Siddhartha and his men conversations. As this story goes on it gets more exciting and more interesting. This is a very good book and I recomend it to anyone who wants a good read.
B000006NPY|1.0|The Pumpkins have always been a very talented and wonderful band, but that all went down the tubes when Adore was released.  How ridiculous can they be, they went from one of the best alternitave rock band to one of the worst.  This industrial computer music is absolutley obsured.  It's like they were getting tired of playing good music.  They use to have a great music sense, but then they did this and I have lost all hope in the band.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I must say, for a rated R movie, they sure got away with a lot.  There are some scenes that are very disgusting, but you can't help but to laugh at it!  This movie is great and the extra footage is even better!  This is an absolutely excellent movie with never-ending laughs!
B00003CXE7|5.0|I have watched this movie 10 times now and not gotten bored.  A definite must see.
B00003CXIY|2.0|I think Road Trip had the potential to be as good as American Pie had it not included the painfully unfunny Tom Green.  His scenes with the mouse and the snake were grating, long-winded and utterly worthless to the plot of the film.  For the first time that I can recall, I actually read through the credits to see if Drew Barrymore (Green's fiancee) was an executive producer.  I figured that would be the only way he would be cast in a film.  Tom Green is a Pauly Shore wannabe (and that, my friends, is not saying much).<br />Other than Tom Green, the other characters were fun to watch and the story was pretty good and oftentimes funny.  Seann William Scott again plays a character similar to his &quot;Stifler&quot; role in American Pie (the oversexed smart aleck), but he plays it very well.  DJ Quills, who plays the nerdy character who, reluctantly, lets his friends use his car and credit card is a big hit.  And all the women are beautiful!<br />If you can ignore Tom Green, you may enjoy the flick.  But there is too much of this unfunny actor to give Road Trip any more than two stars.
6304712499|4.0|This movie has great special effects.  The story line is so, so.  But let's face it; you don't watch a movie like this for the plot.  It is a dark and estorical film that holds some suspense, and a few surprises.  I have seen movies of this sort many times before, but this is defintely one of the better &quot;comic book come to life&quot; movies I've seen.
6303029027|5.0|If a movie stays with me long after I've watched the final credits roll, I know I've watched a great movie. And I'm glad to say that A Bronx Tale is such a movie.<br />This story of C's struggle to balance his love for his hardworking father Lorenzo and the neighborhood mob boss Sonny captivates from beginning to end. I appreciate how Sonny is not written off as a two-bit hood. This is the first movie I've seen that didn't succumb to the usual mobster stereotypes. While I abhored the violence of &quot;the life,&quot; I was touched by Sonny's humanity.<br />One of the most touching moments of the film (among many) was when C seemed to agonize between sitting in the nosebleed section with his father at the boxing match, and sitting with Sonny in the ringside seat. C obviously wanted to go down to ringside, but he seemed to love and respect his father so much that he apologized to his father and stayed put. How many teenagers would do that today? Or at least do so with as much respect and humbleness as opposed to rolling their eyes and smarting off.<br />Joe Pesci's appearance at the end was disturbing but very effective. You could see that he would probably usher in a more hardcore crime element in the neighborhood. So I breathed a sigh of relief when C said he would be &quot;giving the bar a rest.&quot; <br />Since I didn't live in the Bronx during the 1960's, I can't speak for how racial matters were handled. But I found the inclusion of the interracial romance to be well-handled. There was just enough tension and violence to let viewers know that the neighborhood wasn't a racial utopia; but at the same time, the film showed what might have happened--or probably happened, but wasn't talked about much.<br />I think both Taral Hicks (who played Jane) and Lillo Bracato (who played the teenaged C) did a good job of portraying teenage love in an awkward and sweet way. I don't know about anybody else, but I was PLEADING for Jane to pull that door lock up! (Remember Sonny's door test?) <br />Overall, I rank this movie up there at the top as one of the great ones (though severely underappreciated) of all time. Robert De Niro is at his best in this film, though his part seems small. Chazz Palmentieri is also excellent. I wish he would write more screenplays, and allow De Niro to direct.<br />This movie presents themes that anyone (not necessarily any one ethnic group) can relate to, even in 2001. Everything in life is not up or down or left or right. There are gray areas in life that we all struggle with. I think this film does a good job of showing this universal struggle.
B000002J09|1.0|I cannot believe people saying that Led Zeppelin, and in particular this album, are &quot;rock n roll&quot;. That's just not true-Led Zepplelin are really primarily a pop group.They don't have half the anger or ferocity of many other bands.&quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;Rock n Roll&quot; sound so bland and stale that's it's laughable. And don't even bother listening to garbage like &quot;The Battle Of Evermore&quot; &quot;Going To California&quot; or &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, they would send you to sleep if they weren't so annoying. If you like Led Zeppelin you'll like N Sync or Back Street Boys.
0451169514|4.0|It's been a while since I worked up the nerve to read this. It wasn't as freaky as Salem's Lot, but it was pretty bad. It's really amazing that some guy writing words on piece of paper can make me make sure the closet door is shut and that there's nothing under my bed at night.<br />Overall, it's a very good book with part of it in flashbacks and the other part in the present. Very good.
B00000K19E|5.0|you simply can't enjoy THE MATRIX properly on video cassette. If you're planning on getting this movie, just get a DVD player and this DVD. The sound is awesome, the picture is excellent, and there are some really nice extras too. THE MATRIX was the best movie of 1999, you must get it!
B00000IAU3|5.0|When I first heard a Dido song, I thought it sounded a little like the Cranberries, with Haunting vocals and a soft touch. Now I know she has her own style. Every Song on this Cd is beautiful, memorable and are a sure fire stress release. I play Dido at work everyday and we are always being asked who it is. You will not be disappointed with this Cd. Standout tracks include &quot;Here With Me&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot; of course. Buy and enjoy!
1853260193|5.0|If only for the prodigious use of symbolism and the author's unerring sense of verbal wit, Thackery's hefty masterpiece &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; should be taught by all primary school teachers.  Where else can a budding George Osborne or Rebecca Sharp gain the insight and rules they'll need for their societal climbs?  Fairs of vanity are all around us, and where better to equip one's self with the requisite social mores, the perfect dandified behavior, and the suggested utter lack of shame, than in Thackery's fun and brilliant tome?<br />No other novel so effectively presents one character after another, with whom we fail to rally behind.  Throughout the novel the much-catered-to reader finds himself on the verge of throwing his support behind one player after the next.  But, alas, there are no heroes to be found.  In fact, all of the fair's members, save perhaps the quixotic Captain cum Colonel Dobbin, and maybe the saintly though financially hapless Mr. Sedley senior, continuously thwart any attempt on the reader's part at finding one shred of pure decency-anywhere, or with anyone-in this Vanity Fair.  Instead, what Thackery presents his readers is page after page of dubious morals played out in tedious drawing rooms filled with corpulent Nobs, impecunious dandies, and rarefied, although highly mannered, well-born dimwits.  <br />Pathos is in no small evidence in &quot;Vanity Fair.&quot;  Whether it's Amelia Sedley's blind and masochistic love for the rakish George(s) in her life (the son by George senior very much resembles his pathetic father even by the age of 8), or the zenith Mrs. Crawley (a.k.a. Becky Sharp) reaches when at last she is allowed to become &quot;a virtuous lady&quot; (through an interview at Court), the Fair is full of lead-tipped struggles and victories.  <br />We're not meant to shed a tear for anyone in this book.  Instead, we're allowed an unabridged glance at the players and the stages that made up the Vanity Fair of Thackery's day.  The point is--the fair is always open (and always has been, since time immemorial); only the characters and the costumes change.
1568361629|4.0|I highly recommend this book to almost everyone.  It should really get more attention!  <br />The writing is thoughtful and interesting, and the subject matter unique.  The book follows Barack Obama as he grows up and defines himself and his view of the world, as he finds the community that he wants to count himself a member of.  In the end that &quot;community&quot; is really the community of humanity, but this book takes you on Barack's journey.  <br />The author examines his heritage of white, midwesterners on his mother's side and later in the book explores the world of his father, a Kenya of the Luo tribe who came to the U.S. to study.  Three parts of the book I found especially well done. First, the evocation of what it was like to be in Barack's head as a young black man with few black role models in his life and the difficult philosophical (internal) conversation of the African-American community defining itself in white America.  Second, his work as a community organizer in Chicago really dealt well with the complex problems of declining inner cities.  Third, the idealization of his absent father by both himself and his mother and the gradual discovery of the real character of his father and grandfather.<br />Overall, this book was about his struggle to be true to himself and to figure out what that meant.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I have a good collection of tapes of the Beatles,and to say that adding a CD of their No, 1 hits (all 27 of them) to my collection would be an understatement on my part. It's surprising to see that although the Sgt. Pepper album was number one on the album charts in 1967, not one single such as Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Getting better, or With a little help from my friends were to be found on this CD (not to mention any White Album singles). It's hard to question whether or not that these are ALL the no. 1 songs by the Beatles. This is a GREAT CD, don't get me wrong, but it would've been greater if REVOLUTION was snuck in there somewhere
B000002KXO|4.0|Of course nothing meets the high standards of their &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; and &quot;Rumours&quot; releases. However &quot;Mirage&quot; was a welcome release in 1982 when solo Mac material by Nicks and Buckingham had proven the band members could be successful independently as well. It's a tribute to them that they didn't break up for in truth, the sum (of their material as a group) is far greater than the individual parts (their solo stuff).<br />&quot;Mirage&quot; ranks third of their cds to me, much for the reasons mentioned above. The disc is fun and friendly, more welcoming than &quot;Tusk&quot; or anything after &quot;Mirage&quot; (with the exception of &quot;The Dance&quot; perhaps). Favorite tunes: the effervescent &quot;Gypsy&quot;; their best song after &quot;Rumours&quot;, &quot;Love in Store&quot;, &quot;That's Alright&quot; and a few of Lindsey's most fun: &quot;Can't Go Back&quot; and &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; among them. This is NOT &quot;Rumours&quot; by a long shot but it gave one of rock's best bands another chance to show what master artists they could be. And it worked.
006016848X|1.0|This book was awful. Totally repetitive, simplistic, and sexist. Don't waste your time or money. It's authors like this who give the self-help genre a bad name. Gray is a terrible writer, and the information he gives is common sense.
B000000WFF|4.0|again, the spice girls are a pop confection made to be enjoyed, not to change music or get us involved in their political aspirations (a lighthearted shout of 'girl power' the exception). that being said, this is their 'hard day's night', made 2 tie in 2 their movie 'spiceworld'; it is though a bit more artistically reaching, for them anyways. 'stop' is cool motown; '2 much' is primo girl group balladry; 'move over' is a guitar-driven pepsi commercial; and 'viva 4ever' is a 'serious' effort from them. the album ends on a puzzling note with 'the lady is a vamp'-big band, '40's style group effort that makes you think they're gonna start tap-dancing in white suits with 'spice' in giant neon behind them. again, this group is a whole lotta fun, even if they are rapidly becoming a memory in pop culture. so get over yourselves and enjoy these memories. this is not bad manufatured pop at all. we should tell them to re-record '4ever' and start writing songs about their affairs, in an acoustic-guitar-sitar setting. 'rubber soul' anyone? more like 'plastic soul'. but what the hell?
6304080921|5.0|Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, and Madeleine Stowe all excel in possibly the greatest sci-fi film ever. &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; is an imaginative and fast-moving film that keeps you thinking and guessing until the very end. The movie's eeriness and frequent jumping back and forth through time make it all the more intersting. The ending ties into the rest of the film very nicely. I was left in awe after the film ended.
0440213525|3.0|I have just finished reading one of your brilliant novels, The Client.  The plot of the novel was very interesting and engaging.  I really enjoyed the suspense and the thrill throughout the novel, but the story line could've been more realistic and more original.<br /> You have shown a great perspective of life.  By reading this novel, I realized that as we grow older we will deal with dangers and criticisms from others, at least once in our lives.  You have portrayed an important fact quite clearly and nicely.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.  However, the plot of the novel seemed very unrealistic.  For example, Mark is so young and helpless because he's 11 years old.  We don't see many 11-year-old boys getting around by themselves.  It's pretty obvious that they are too young to get a lawyer.  I found it very annoying.  Also, The Client didn't have any twist to the story.  It was really straight forward and in your face.  I like a novel that has some mysterious and exciting climaxes or surprises.   This novel had neither surprises nor mysteriousness, which made it quite boring and tedious to read.  I was expecting more violence and anxiety to the story, but there weren't.  In addition, the ending was very broad.  <br /> In conclusion, I will give it another try and read one other novel of yours because I hear many people love reading your novels.  I may have offended you a little, but I'm just discussing about The Client and how it could've been written better.
B00003CXDG|4.0|Movies are entertainment. The key word here is ENTERTAINMENT. Mission Impossible 2 was meant to be a summer blockbuster, and it was a very effective one at that. If you want dull Oscar contenders, wait until December, please. Oh, and the casting of Thandie Newton as the love interest was a refreshing change. It's so much better than just another non-descript, homely girl (like the ones in the 'Oscar' contender movies).
0792110188|5.0|What kind of fans are you?!This movie does not deserve to be ranked below ANY of the other John Wayne Classics.   This movie was funny, action, and held a great deal  of human values. The song alone is worth more than 4 and one half stars. Shame on you people!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I was (and am still) a very large sceptic of Anime, as is my brother; so when my brother forced me to watch this movie, I knew it must be a stand out film, and it didnt dissapoint.<br />  Put simply, this is a masterpiece of film making. Easily the best animated film I have ever seen, this enemy-less romp through feudal Japan comes complete with menacing demons, and increadibly erie gods. A must have for theater buffs, or anyone for that matter.
B00004THDI|1.0|I would love to purchase and listen to this Soundtrack but it seems that a entirely new piece of hardware is required just to listen to it. Why in the world do we need another CD format and why isnt this disc available on a regular CD also??  This kind of myopic marketing just amazes me...I want the soundtrack, have the money to buy it, as many others do no doubt, but I cant play it if I buy it. I cant think of many things more irritating than wanting to make a purchase and being told &quot;Nope, you cant have it&quot;.
0679720200|5.0|I think that The Stranger is a great book.  Not only is this book an excellent departure from typical modern writing, it is also interesting in its own right.  Meursault is one of the most interesting and well-fleshed-out characters I've ever read, and the book stays succinct, never becoming overlong or drawn-out.  I actually felt Meursault's agitation on the beach, in the heat, with the light shining in his eyes; his annoyance in the cell with the chaplain.  This book represents, to me, what can be done with a character if he's handled correctly, and even only as far as that this book is worth a lot.  But it's interesting, too, which is definitely a plus.  Overall, this book, short though it may be, is a welcome and worthy addition to my bookshelf.<br />Textually, l'Etranger is quite a strange novel.  It defies many typical writing standards, while putting exceptional emphasis on others.  The novel is truly a character study, with the only world-building included solely to enhance the character.  As such, the book probably won't be a favorite of the general populace any time soon, with the need of most people for description, details and heroes, characters that can be cheered for.  Meusault, in any event, is certainly not much of a hero to root for.<br />Reading The Stranger, I found myself wondering what kind of person Albert Camus is (was?).  I haven't read any of his other stuff, but I find it unlikely that he is much like Meursault in attitude, or the novel would never have been written.  On the other hand, how did Camus delve so deeply into the mind of such a man if he's never experienced a similar mindset?  Is Meursault an embodiment of Camus' fears for the human race, what with his passivity and easy acceptance of everything, or is he an embodiment of the author's hopes, in his simple honesty and naïveté?  It would be interesting to find out where Camus got the idea for this particular personage.<br />In closing, I would just like to point out a couple ofthings.  First, I do know that this is regarded as an existentialist, modernist classic piece and whatnot, but I decided to judge it against other contemporary fiction because I don't really know much about that other stuff.  And finally, this is definitely a book worth reading even if you don't end up liking it.
B000002GVZ|5.0|I'm only 20 years old, so I didn't hear Carly until fairly recently when I found this album in the CD player of a house I was housesitting.  This was the first album I heard of Carly's and I was immediately drawn to her unique voice and style.  Now just 2 years after first hearing her, I own all of her albums (including an original LP that she and her sister recored before Carly went solo) and name her as my favorite vocalist, performer, and songwriter.  Though this collection only contains 10 songs, they are some of Carly's very best early work.  &quot;That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be&quot; is in my opinion one of the most hauntingly poignant songs written about the last generation; &quot;The Right Thing to Do&quot;, &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Legend in Your Own Time&quot;, You're So Vain&quot;, &quot;Haven't Got Time for the Pain&quot;, &quot;We Have No Secrets&quot;, &quot;Night Owl&quot;, &quot;Anticipation&quot; (which was written in 15 minutes while Carly was waiting to go on a date with Cat Stevens) and &quot;Attitude Dancing&quot; are also all gems in their own way.  This is an absolutely essential album even if you already have all the albums that the songs are originally from.  If you've never heard Carly or don't yet own any of her albums, this is a good place to start.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|Gee, what do we have have here?  Could it be another needlessly repackaged collection of Beatles songs that, in all honesty, were never that great anyway?  Even more mindless is that it is a collection of their chart topping songs, as if that was a measure of true artistic merit.<br />Of course, as I write this, &quot;1&quot; has already sold something along the lines of 5 million copies domestically.  Does this validate the greatness of The Beatles?  Not really; rather it proves yet again that most consumers would rather be told what is good music as opposed to thinking for themselves.  In sum, The Beatles were the most overrated (not to mention innocuous) band that has ever existed, and this collection is a waste of time and money.<br />Oh no, I've dared speak against the gods of pop.  Let's see how many sheep will say this review isn't useful as a result.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|...and this is coming from somebody who wasn't even alive when any of these records were released. Heck, I wasn't even alive when Lennon was alive, and I still think this is fantastic. There was almost no way this could fail; I mean, how could any collection of some peak moments from a group as talented as the Beatles fail? My only disappointment is that due to the way the CD is laid out (only the A-sides of the chart-topping single), we miss out on &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot;, which are two of the most innovative songs of all time. Perhaps a B-sides compilation sometime in the future? Still though, I can't complain about the quality of what's there. If you need to own these singles in one place (and believe me, you do), buy this. It's a living monument to the talents of John, Paul, George, and Ringo.
B000006NPY|2.0|heres the thing, im a huge smashing pumpkins fan but this album only has two good songs on it, perfect and ava adore.  if you want a real good smashing pumpkins album go with mellon collie and the infinite sadness.
B00000612P|5.0|If you could only have one Rod Stewart album, this would be the one to have. It is quintessential Rod Stewart: brash and raucous one minute, poignant and mournful another.<br /><br />This CD contains some terrific songs, and they run the gamut in feeling from the folksy &#34;Maggie May&#34; to the lyrical&#34; Mandolin Wind&#34; to the pure, motown/rock refrains of &#34;I'm Losing You&#34; . It also contains one of the greatest songs ever written by Tim Hardin &#34;Reason To Believe&#34;. That alone, in and of itself, is reason enough to have this CD.

From the early years being shunned and harshly criticized by most, to the movie years and after as &quot;The King&quot; adored by all, every detail, both personal and professional, is presented in an honest and unbiased, yet tastefully personal, documentary honoring the best of the world's Rock and Roll Royalty.  An absolute &quot;must have&quot; for any Elvis fan!
6305069611|4.0|I first saw this film when it was released in the mid nineteen seventies. I recalled how much I had enjoyed it, when I saw that it was available in DVD. The DVD itself is disappointing, as it offers virtually none of the features one has come to expect from a DVD. Moreover, the exterior packaging itself gives inaccurate information, as the movie became a \\"70s cult classic\\" not an \\"80s\\" one. I only wish that Criterion Studios would select this film as one for their collection, as I they always release beautiful copies of the films that they choose.<br /><br />This aside, the film itself, though somewhat abstract, is terrific, as it is not just a science fiction film with a twist. It is a film that explores themes that are timeless: desolation, alienation (no pun intended), and loneliness. At times, these themes are palpable, due to David Bowie's wondrously androgynous performance which is heartbreakingly moving at times.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple. An alien, Davie Bowie, leaves his family on his dying and arid planet in search for water. He lands on earth and begins his project to send water to his devasted planet by amassing the wealth that he needs to do this. He patents numerous lucrative inventions which eventually find him at the head of a world wide conglomerate. He joins up with a kindly, though stupid and vapid woman who drinks gin like a fish, Candy Clark, with whom he begins a liaison of sorts. Yet, he is always lonely and melancholic, and like her, begins to spiral into an alcoholic haze, sometimes sidetracking him from his purpose here.<br /><br />At some point, excruciatingly sad and lonely, longing for his family, he reveals himself to her for who he truly is, shedding his earthly appearance, only to be met with absolute horror and repugnance by her at the sight of him. She ultimately tries to understand him, but it is truly beyond her ken. He is infinitely sad at this and longs all the more for home.<br /><br />On the threshhold of returning to his planet and loved ones, he is kidnapped by corporate raiders who take over his holdings, and it is here that the movie begins to disintergrate somewhat. Yet, it remains strangely hypnotic and compelling, and becomes a sort of \\"Lost Weekend\\" of betrayal, booze, and promises which will never be kept. A parable of wanting to belong, yet knowing that you truly never will. A story about wanting to go home, but knowing on some level that you truly can never go home again.to his planet and loved ones, he is kidnapped by corporate raiders who take over his holdings, and it is here that the movie begins to disintergrate somewhat.

B0000399WI|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. Robbins and Freeman are excellent and their characters' friendship (essentially the core of this movie) makes it worth watching repeatedly.
B000001GLK|3.0|Pollini's interpretation of Beethoven's piano concertos is quite peaceful, clear and poetic particularly in the 1st and the 3rd concertos.  However, I don't think Beethoven is as romantic and poetic as Chopin.  I'd prefer a more dramatic interpretation of Beethoven's piano concertos with Ashkenazy/Chicago Symphony/Solti and Brendel/London Philharmonic/Haitink being my favorites.  I do enjoy Pollini's performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in D major (the piano version after his violin concerto) a lot and I think which is much better than Barenboim's 1973's recording with the English Chamber Orchestra, but I just cannot make myself enjoy this set that much.
B000000WCV|4.0|This album has something that I'm positive you'll enjoy, and then something that I'm just as sure you'll hate. <br />It took me a whole year to discover the best track on album, &quot;Rollin' &amp; Scratchin'&quot;, because I was too busy jamming on the strength of the singles and I just regarded everything past track seven as filler.<br />Do not let &quot;Revolution 909&quot;, &quot;Da Funk&quot;, and &quot;Around The World&quot; dominate your overall listening time for this album. They are wonderful songs that will take you some time to get tired of, but there's a lot more on this disc!<br />Yes, there is some filler on the second half of the album, but &quot;Homework&quot; has more than enough to be worth your cash.

0767805712|3.0|Wolverine from the X-men. The Fonz from Happy Days. Han Solo from Star Wars. Spock from Star Trek. Ayukawa Madoka from Kimagure orenji rôdo. Even Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet. These characters all have several things in common. 1) They are all very Cool, 2) All were supporting characters (as opposed to the stars) of their particular story, 3) All were the only Cool characters in their story.<br />Number three is the thing that really made them work. It is a proven fact that people like &quot;the cool character&quot; and so many times a writer of a book or a movie or a television show or even professional wrestling tries to make all the characters &quot;cool.&quot; But when every character is a cold, stoic, cigarette smoking SOB with a killer instinct, the effect is diminished. This is the major problem with the movie Gattaca.<br />One could theorize that Writer/Director Andrew Niccol was trying to make a statement about the loss of humanity that occurs in a world built on gene-gineered perfection. But if this is the case, then the metaphor never really materializes. Instead we have a film where all the characters are so cool... so intense... that it is hard to actually identify with any of them. Again, it could be argued that this is intentional, but somehow, I feel as though my inability to truly identify with Ethan Hawke's Vincent character removes something from my enjoyment of the film.<br />That said, I must admit that I did enjoy Gattaca. For starters, the film is simply breathtakingly beautiful. Furthermore, the concept behind the film is very ambitious and Niccol exploration of the idea is very concise and complete. The ideas generated by the questions this movie asks can provide the viewer with philosophical musings for the rest of the evening.<br />The lead actors, Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman (not to mention supporting actors Jude Law and Loren Dean) provide no shortage of eye-candy for male of female viewers. One cannot find a fault in Hawke's actingin this film (or Thurman's to be fair) so much as with the characters they were portraying. <br />The tragedy of this film is that there could have been a beautiful love story here. But the characters are so cold that it is hard to see why Irene (Thurman) and Vincent (Hawke) would fall for each other at all. The only truly attractive quality either displays is unbelievable drive.<br />Despite its faults, this film is still somewhat recommended. The cinematography is excellent and the ideas presented are so insightful that I can look past the faults of the movie enough to give it 3 stars.
B00003CXGP|4.0|I have to say, personally, that &quot;American Psycho&quot; was one of the better films to be released in the year 2000. Compared to the other drivel and cliched movies that Hollywood released, expecting the audiences to unquestioningly choke down with their popcorn, &quot;American Psycho&quot; was a stand out and well-worth checking out, in my opinion.<br />The main character, Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), is the perfect example of the limitless clones that wondered through their selfish and uncaring lives in the American 1980s, devoid of any sense of common human morals and sense of decency. He works and lives Wallstreet, and what sets him apart from his other Harvard Vs. Yale &quot;friends&quot; is that he is completely and utterly insane. While his co-workers are stressing over deciding on which font setting looks best on their business cards and trying to get reservations at the stylish restaurant of the week, Bateman is struggling with his unquenchable lust to murder. The movie takes off from there, trying to show whether or not Patrick will go too far with his evil desires.<br />What I really liked about &quot;American Psycho,&quot; besides the fact that it was better than 90% of the other films released in 2000, was that it didn't rely on gore and gratuitous violence to create an entertaining movie. The fact is that most of the violence is implied. Movies like &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; in the recent resurface in the teen horror flick genre have featured more violence and have left me more disturbed in its visual violence than in watching &quot;American Psycho.&quot;<br />Another aspect is that each actor or actress works very well in his or her part, each showing the total insignificance of one person to the other in the corrupt business world of the 1980s. Some characters don't show up as much because they are just not important, and especially not meaningful to Patrick Bateman.<br />The 1980s are captured very well in this film. From the discussions Bateman has about popular music acts of the time to sly references to sitcoms.<br />This film works very well on three levels: first as a satire of the Yuppie Wallstreet era of the 1980s; second, as a murderous dark comedy; and third, as a surreal look into the mind of a very disturbed individual.<br />If you like dark comedies much like &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; and &quot;Fight Club,&quot; then you'll probably enjoy &quot;American Psycho.&quot; However, if you don't like movies that push the limits to the mainstream, then you'll probably want to skip this one. This one is not for the kiddies (they won't understand) and not for the politically minded with strong left or right tendencies (they won't understand). It takes a weird sense of humor.
B00003CXDG|2.0|They should have named this movie &quot;Matrix Wannabe&quot;. This is everything that is bad about Hollywood summer action films.  The action sequences were beyond ridiculous.  This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall repeatedly.  I found this movie only slightly less annoying than cleaning my cat's litterbox.  The only good thing I have to say about it is that it is visually entertaining.
6305171769|5.0|Halloween H20 I thought would no way compare to the origional, but i was wrong, it was almost better. Jamie Lee Curtis made a great return as Kerry Tate the headmaster of a prestegious private school, when on halloween night michael myers makes his return to come after her, and now her son john, his girlfriend, and their friends. Finally in this movie Kerry gets rid of michael meyers for good.
0812548094|5.0|I'll admit, I havn't read the entire series (just finished Blood of the Fold), but Stone of Tears is the best of the first three. I'll have to agree that it was extremely slow at the beginning, but the battles with the Imperial Order make up for that. Goodkind delivers a extremely well written story, that packs a punch. During the first few hundred pages, Goodkind is winding up, but the last twenty or so, the delivery is so great, that I got in trouble by my parents for not listening to them when they called. A very good foothold for a very promising series!
630451087X|4.0|I first saw &quot;Lost Highway&quot; about 3 years ago when it hit video, and thought it was a good if not great effort by famed weirdo director David Lynch.  On the whole, I enjoyed the warped logic of the story, the eclectic cast of characters, and the sudden conclusion.  On the techincal end, I thought the picture (presented in full-screen format) was fuzzy and murky, and often distracted from the film; that, and the soundtrack (with contributions from Angelo Badalamenti and Trent Reznor) felt underused.<br />Well, recently I purchased the letterboxed version of &quot;Lost Highway,&quot; and was amazed at how much better the movie seemed watching through that squashed rectangle of screen.  The picture actually seemed to be remastered a bit from the original video print (the fuzziness is mostly gone), and for some reason the movie didn't flow as clunkily as it had the other times I viewed it.<br />Lynch is an undeniably talented director, but if you rent (or buy) &quot;Lost Highway&quot; based upon his reputation alone, you might be disappointed.  The dream-like story (about a jazz saxophonist who may or may not have killed his wife, is put in prison, and mysteriously morphs into a young mechanic with mob links) lacks the smooth flow of events that was present in Lynch's excellent &quot;Blue Velvet.&quot;  What's most distracting are the meaningless, drawn-out sex scenes that seem to come one after another in the second act; either Lynch really loved seeing Patricia Arquette naked, or he wanted to see how far he could push the movie's R rating.<br />All in all, &quot;Lost Highway&quot;--even with its noticeable flaws--is better than most of the films mainstream Hollywood puts out.  Even if you don't like it, it will be hard not to claim this film  is a good conversation piece.
0393317552|4.0|The fact that a book that claims to explain the origins of human society doesn't contain a *single* controversial statement from the perspective of the politically correct left should perhaps come as a warning sign that this book is less of a revolutionary exploration than a reflection of current academic biases.<br />That being said, this is an incredibly good book.
B000002UB3|5.0|this album is a masterpiece to say the least.it covers many different styles of music and is the finest album the fab four ever made.so take the 15 bucks out of your wallot and get it right now!!
B000001Y5X|5.0|When I first went out and bought this album I was expecting something similar to &quot;Anti-christ Superstar&quot;, but I found out that I was completley wrong.  This album is much different then ACS.  One thing is that it is not as heavy as its ACS.  The lyrics are also not as anti-god as ACS.  Anyway I would have to say this album is better then ACS because each track seems to have more creative points and the guitars are much more catchy.  To be honest this actually reminds me more of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; than &quot;Anti-christ Superstar&quot;.  Anyway if you don't have this album yet you should buy it.
B000002UAX|5.0|well what can i say that hasnt already been said??this isnt as good as abbey road,revolver,or sgt pepper but it is still essential,so buy it today.
0440180295|5.0|'Slaughterhouse-Five' is Kurt Vonnegut's masterpiece of war and it's consequences to the average joe.  Vonnegut's protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, has come unstuck in time.  One moment he's in World War Two, the next he's a middle aged optomitrist, the next he's a small boy, the next he's on the far away world of Tralfamadore, the next he's delivering a speech that will end in his death.  Through this bumping back and forth through time Billy learns that life is a collection of moments and that linear thinking is unique to the human race.  Funny, sad and thought provoking, 'Slaughterhouse-Five' is an intelligent look at one man's journey through life after living through the horrors of war.  Brilliant!
B0000508U6|5.0|So there I was, laying in my bed, the streetlight shining through a crack in the blinds. I put on Parachutes as my eyes slowly began to close. From the very beginning I was overwhelmed. &quot;Yellow&quot; attracted me to the album, but I was afraid the other songs on the album would be different and unsatisfying. There is a cohesion between these songs which places the audience on a smooth mental plane while simultaneously beating out fresh, quick music which will satisfy your senses till the CD stops spinning. Mostly all of the songs are fantastic, and it's a must-have in any serious listener's library.
0375501851|4.0|Though this book didn't live up to all the hype it received earlier last year, I still enjoyed it a great deal.  When I read a description of the book prior to reading it, I thought it was going to be just about the relationship between Archie and Samad.  However, as I read the book it became more the other characters who helped mold the relationship: Clara, Alsana, Irie, Millet and Magid, etc...  The psychology in the book is very interesting; it is almost funny to think that Archie wouldn't have met all these people and been in such scenarios had he commited suicide.  I also thought this book was going to be hard to get through because there are some many characters; in reality Smith writes about them in such a way that their striking personalities stay with you.  After reading it, I realized how the title of the book, White Teeth, plays a major role in how race, politics, and sex collide in today's cosmopolitan London.  This is truly a good novel from a first-time author.  I hope to see more from Smith in the future.
B00004U30D|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for short attention span movies.  As much as I enjoy movies like this one, in my mind, I'm secretly wishing for them to just hurry up and cut to the chase.  This movie was recommended to me, however, by someone who makes my attention deficit disorder look like I could sit and read War and Peace, so I gave it a shot.<br />What did I think of this movie... Let's see...  It as incredibly unpredictable, which is such a rare treat these days, it is definately NOT the poop from the same dog wrapped up in different paper as most movies are lately, it provides just the perfect blend of ingredients to give the viewer a taste of our main character's state of mind, it's real but quite surreal, it makes a slough of social statements most subtly, which I am quite impressed with.<br />DESPITE the grumpings of all those who think they know better and have a great deal more knowledge of films, or background or whatever it is that qualifies them to tell me what I should and should not like, this movie is STILL GOOD.  This is coming from someone like myself, who us drawn to shallow, light movies because I can't sit still for very long. If *I* sat through it, and watched it, and wasn't counting ceiling tiles or making a running commentary, and this movie was able to hold the attention of a complete 30 year old child, it was EXCELLENT.  It was poignant, beautiful, artful, filled to the brim with talent and worth every grain of its salt.<br />Watch it.  And do so like you're having a huge piece of chocolate mousse cake... taste and savour every bite.
B00004R99J|5.0|Six years ago when I first saw &quot;Pocohontas,&quot; I didn't find it special at all, or worthy of any praise. But in the past week, I rented it, almost as a joke, and fell in love with the animation, the very commendable score, and the lesson learned by watching it. In that period of five nights before it was due, I must have watched the tape twenty times! To me, this is a movie that can't grow old. <br />First of all, the music is, in my opinion, one of the best Disney scores in my memory. Just seven days ago I reclaimed the tape from a friend, and have been listening to it nonstop since. Alex Menkin's music makes the listener feel the emotion portrayed by the scene. One of my favorite parts is the skirmish between the Indian warrior Kocoum and John Smith. This whole musical segment    Six years ago when I first saw &quot;Pocohontas,&quot; I didn't find it special at all, or worthy of any praise.

Just seven  days ago I reclaimed the tape from a friend, and have been listening to it nonstop since. Alex  Menkin's music makes the listener feel the emotion portrayed by the scene. One of my favorite parts  is the skirmish between the Indian warrior Kocoum and John Smith. This whole musical segment is  outstanding on its own, but when viewed with the graphics, it is truly memorable. (Am I getting  carried away???) My favorite piece in the score, however, is the end title &quot;If I Never Knew You.&quot;  This song is amazing. That's all I can say. Another favorite of mine is the song &quot;Savages.&quot; The lyrics  take the other side of the prejudice, that of the Native Americansthemselves. Because in this song,  no longer are the Indians the only &quot;savages,&quot; but the Englishmen are being unrightfully judged as  well. <br />    Next, the animation. The scenes in Virginia are breathtaking, especially the scene with  Pocohontas' and John Smith's first meeting. Much better than that of the flatter animation of some of  the earlier Disney classics. (One flaw might be Pocohontas' waistline, but let's not get in to that now.  Hey, it's Disney!) The animation during the &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; song is unrealistic, but dreamlike.  Another asset is the segment near the beginning of the movie in the storm at sea. <br />    And now I'm about to buy the DVD version of this Disney movie. I have the gift certificate in hand  (er, in computer) and I'm going to purchase it no matter what anyone says about the quality of the  picture. It's gotta be at least as good as VHS, and considering what movie this is, that's good enough  for me. I think this is one of the very best Disney movies so far, and very essential to your collection,  with or without kids! (I'm much too old to be buying this for myself, but youth is inside, right?)
6305499365|5.0|I loved this movie so much that after I rented it I immediately went out and purchased my own copy. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to ANYONE who has ever worked in a corporate environment as either a drone or a manager (I've been both). The movie is so realistic it's impossible.<br />You will be hooked from the opening sequence (featuring Mambo #8) where Peter switches from lane to lane in rush hour traffic only to prove Murphy's Law - The other line ALWAYS moves faster, to Samir swearing up a storm in his car, to Michael Bolton rapping in his car, to the old guy on the sidewalk passing everybody with his walker. Flash forward to the final scene where Milton (the film's true hero) is berading a resort waiter over cocktails, this movie funny from start to finish.<br />Buy this movie if for no other reason than to be able to watch it after a bad day at work or to cheer up a coworker/friend who's had a bad day. You will watch this movie over and over and over again.
B00004YA66|5.0|A great movie with multiple plots.  I watched this movie twice in one day the first day I owned it!  Great acting by Dennis Quaid. Great story line, and a good music soundtrack too. I only buy videos &amp; DVD's of those movies that I think will stand the test of time, and I'll watch again and again. This is one of them.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I bought the CD purely for Californication and Otherside, which remain two of my favorite tracks. But as soon as I brought it home, I was blown away by the quality of the music. I had never been a fan of RHCP, and I figured this would be another Limp Bizkit with two good tracks and nothing else worth mentioning.<br />I was wrong. These guys don't use swearing to the point of making me sick (although they don't by any means avoid profanity), and the words to the songs are quite intelligible! Parallel Universe has a very good guitar solo, and after all the heavy guitars and bass, Porcelain is a sudden, mellow little tune.<br />I couls spend an hour on Easily, the absolute best song on the album. &quot;The story of a woman on the morning of a war/Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for&quot; is an unbelievably deep line, and I cannot express enough the amazing power of the song unless you can hear it for yourself.<br />No CD is a must-have, really. For example, if you are a fan of Yanni, you probably won't like this CD. But if you like deep lyrics and (insert noun here =&gt;)_____ -kicking beats, then this is a CD you'll like.
0375500901|5.0|I loved The Marching Season and Mark of the Assasin, but this just doesn't seem like Silva. Don't get me wrong I'm a HUGE Daniel Silva fan.  I love his common sense detail and easy to follow plots in the past.  This novel borders on everything he's created in the past with characters and places. A few of the previous characters are there but hopefully he'll bring back the painter-assassin from Mark of the Assasin and The Marching Season.  The story line was a little hard to follow at times, esp. the flash backs, but none the less a great read. <br />Basically this is a good book. If you like Silva you'll buy this book anyways. If you've never read Silva then you'll definately want to buy this book.  Reading time is about three to four days, but definately worth it.  Can't wait for the next one.
0553106635|5.0|...and gasp in disbelief. As the book barrels toward the climax like an 18-wheeler with no brakes, every chapter will make you light-headed with wonder and horror. Evil happens to the evil and good to the good in thrilling, shiveringly satisfying events -- and then evil happens to the good and good to the evil in jaw-dropping, shattering -- but somehow equally satisfying -- moments. The final revelation, at the tail end of the epilogue, knocked me for a loop for hours afterward.<br />A lot of reviewers are tearing Jordan to pieces, and while that's somewhat fair in light of his last 2 or 3 books, I have to say the only book that's equalled the roller-coaster ride of agony and ecstasy in A Storm of Swords is Jordan's Dragon Reborn (Book 3 of Wheel of Time). Remember when Jordan's revelations came fast and furious, when his detailed world history was rich and rewarding rather than tedious, remember when you used to shout out loud with the end of every chapter because you could not BELIEVE what just happened and couldn't WAIT to see what happened next? That's Martin's Storm of Swords. The main difference between the two? Martin's story has a murderously hard edge that promises he will never lapse into complacency.<br />Martin is the new master, no question. Jordan needs to study Storm of Swords and remember how to make things HAPPEN -- like he used to do, and still could.
0785791655|5.0|I'll admit I was drawn to this book because of the movie (which is one of my favorites).  But the book is even better... a much more in depth look at &quot;Rudy's&quot; background and his challenges.  Grisham has an amazing way of mixing daily activities with courtroom drama to create absolute masterpieces.  I'm a huge Grisham fan and &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; is definitely one of his best.
B000000W5P|5.0|This cd makes me want to jump-up and down, scream at the ceiling, and dance everywhere I want to dance.  This album screams with freedom and individuality.  It is one of the greatest rock albums ever with its imaginative dirty cords tickling the soul of passion.  Buy this cd...it deserves to be heard...by everyone.
B00000JNO2|5.0|this is a good album. dont no why everyone thinks it is so sorry. this album has excellent songs i mean, searchin, gimme back my bullets, all i can do is write about it, roll gypsy roll, plus they include the live version of gimme back my bullets, and that song rocks. i recommend that if u r a true lynyrd skynyrd fan u will definately enjoy this album
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I was stunned to read some of the other reviews of this CD, people who don't understand the Beatles.  One person, who was obviously a young person, compared them to Men Without Hats and N-Sync!  This person also stated that he/she hoped the Beatles don't make any new music.  Have a clue, dude, the Beatles broke up in 1970!  <br />This album ONLY CONTAINS songs that hit #1 on the Billboard, Cashbox, or British charts.  That's why no Sgt. Pepper songs are on here - none of those songs were released as singles.<br />What's nice is that these songs are put on the CD in chronological order of their hitting #1.  That's why Long and Winding Road is the last song.  As you listen to the CD, you can hear the changes in their music style as they matured as a band.<br />This is a greatest hits album, so don't expect some real groovy insights or a concept with the track order.  Its simply the 27 songs that hit #1.
B00004STPT|5.0|The first viewing of this movie left me misty eyed. Not because of it's ending, but because of the moving song that accompained it. The ending track &quot;Now We Are Free&quot; is most likely the best reason to purchase this album. Melodic weaves were intertwined through the movie, able to give you a hint of what would be, while also letting your ears relish in the blissful tones of Lisa Gerrard's vocals. It reminds me in a way of Enya, a personal favourite. If you love music that is certainly ambient, and peaceful, then you definitely would like this album.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Even if she's reminicent of Sinad O'Connor and Sarah McLachlan, British-born singer/songwriter Dido (die-dough) stands in a class all her own.  After stealing her first recorder, Dido quickly tuned in and adapted to music.  Most of her teenage years were spent touring with her brother and his band Faithless, whose albums contain some of Dido's earlier work.  After relentless touring with the band, Dido quickly learned and crafted her voice.  She also began to make demos of her own songs and music.  Arista founder Clive Davis heard some of these demos and had Dido signed to the label.  The album contains many songs which have the shot of bringing Dido more success.  Much of the album is about love with songs like &quot;Here With Me,&quot; &quot;My Lover's Gone,&quot; &quot;All You Want,&quot; and of course the Alanis Morissette-like &quot;Don't Think of Me.&quot;  Dido proves she's no sappy girl in love with songs like &quot;Honestly Ok,&quot; the bluesy/jazz rhythm &quot;My Life,&quot; &quot;Isobel,&quot; which repeatedly questions/justifies abortion or so it implies, and the Beth Orton-like &quot;I'm No Angel.&quot;  The album's bonus track, &quot;Take My Hand,&quot; is a refreshing and great end to a great debut album.  Much of the credit goes to Dido's amazing writing capability and voice, not to mention musical training.  Don't forget brother/producer Rollo, who helped produce and spice up the album with a large amount of techno and dance beats.  This album should be #1 on the list of albums you need to listen to before you die.  Buy this album, it's worth every penny.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|I see an alarming trend in the movies these days; a big budget movie with a tremendous cast and absolutely no script. &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; is one of those films. You look at a movie with Nick Cage, Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, and Angelina Jolie, and you would have to think it was going to be good, but you'd be wrong. From a purely visual standpoint the film is slick and entertaining, but in reality it is a poorly written mediocre action movie. Nicholas Cage plays Randall &quot;Memphis&quot; Raines a legend in the auto theft community who is forced out of retirement to save his kid brothers (played by the always strange Giovanni Ribisi) life. Raines must recruit a group of car thieves (Jolie, Duvall and others) who are capable of stealing 50 rare and exotic cars in 72 hours while the crafty police detective (played by Lindo) is hot on their trail. From there the movie goes on to be a disappointing mix of bad one liners and stale dialogue. Duvall's talent is absolutely wasted in this picture, and Angelina Jolie's physical appearance is down right frightening (what ever happend to that pretty girl from &quot;The Bone Collecter&quot;?). As a guy I have to admit that I loved the action and the car chases especially the final chase with Cage, but the ending is so far fetched that you wouldn't believe it. Overall I have to admit that the car chases, explosions and hot cars appealed to the guy part of  me enough to say that I liked the movie, but as a movie lover I have to say that I felt a bit cheated.
0061002747|5.0|Murder on the Orient Express is a very exciting book with a really unexpected ending. Hercule Poirot (the main character) solves yet another puzzling crime.<br />The story takes place on the unusually crowded Orient Express (A prestigious Euroean train), which is forced to stop practically in the middle of nowhere because of a snow storm, and nobody can get in or out of it, again, because of the storm.<br />On the train, in the Calais coach, where the murder was commited are some very unusual characters: A big Italian man; The killed man's valet; The killed man's secretary; A Russian princess; A count and a countess; A detective undercover, who pretends he is a dealer of typewriter ribbons; A loud American woman; Hercule Poirot, Monsieur Bouc, and Dr. Constantine; And some more unusual characters.<br />The murder is commited sometime in the night, and on the next day, Hercule Poirot, Monsieur Bouc (Poirot's friend, and manager of the train company), and Dr. Constantine (another one of Poirot's friends) start questioning the suspects (in this case, everybody) and looking for evidence. They know that the killer is very clever, and still on board.<br />When I got this book I thought, well, I'm just going to read about the evidence and stuff like that, and that will be all. Well, it wasn't. The first part of the book (first 50 pages) really isn't very interesting even though I enjoyed it very much. But after page 50, you will not be able to take your eyes off of it. I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning and read all 200 pages in one night, because I said to myself &quot;I won't be able to go to sleep until I know who the killer is.&quot;<br />Get this book. It's worth it.

0783227272|2.0|I look with suspicion at anything that Spielberg lays his hand upon. THis was no exception. SPielberg is the total master of manipulation, disguising himself as a &quot; Great director&quot; . But hes not, he only plays with the audiences emotion using cheap tricks. In &quot; AMISTAD &quot;, slavery issue was almost left untouched, as if it is a normal thing. Blergh !
0688170528|5.0|I read this novel for an English class, but i am so glad that i did.  It was such a good book!  The ending seemed unreal but its the only way it could have been.  I am going to tell all my friends to read The Pact.I absolutly love this book!!  I borrowed it from a teacher and i am now going to go out and buy a copy for myself!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Ok. First off I worship NIN so this is really hard for me to say.  This is the best pop album I've ever heard and the only one I have.  Yes Oops is a catchy song and I thought that it would be the best song on the album. I was just too wrong.  Anyways my friend made me listen to it and aside from 2 songs its a really good album.  I know for a fact that pop albums have one good song and the rest is crap.  Dont ask me to site my source, its just true. Britney's just stick to your head and you cant get them out.  I swear the producers put subliminal messages in them to make the public like them.  I dont know what they did but just listen to it for yourself and you'll buy it.  She's in my CD player right now, along with Manson and NIN.  Plus the best part about buying it online you won't have to buy it from that cute girl at the register.  Get it in the mail and tell your friends off if they get on your case, I do.
B000051VWW|3.0|My first experience listening to Sade was when I was on my way to work at the hospital one night (Registered Nurse on the graveyard shift) and I heard &quot;Hang On To Your Love&quot; from &quot;Diamond Life&quot;. I remember exclaiming &quot;Who is this? Whoever it is, I've got to have it!&quot; I have bought every Sade title since then. I fell in love with the smooth jazz, Brazilian beats, and the sultry voice. Each album was at once sensuous and intense. This CD was certainly long-coming.<br />So, it hurts me to say I am disappointed. I wanted her to continue where she left off. This CD does not have some of the background beats that I have become accustomed to by Sade. No sax. Nothing uptempo. All  relatively quiet. No varience. Definitely mood music. The CD is not bad. It's actually quite good, but not good enough for a Sade CD--especially after an eight year wait.  It's no &quot;Love Deluxe&quot;. I'll play it in the car to get more accustomed to it and maybe it'll grow on me. Sade, please don't wait another 8 years! We need more--more of what you symbolized to us!
0679879269|1.0|Unfortunately, as in the way of many series of books, the first was transcendent, unique, and beautiful. The second explored the universe more, but lacked the true gorgeousness of the first. The third is just odd and dull with a lot of meaningless detail and inexplicably bad dialogue. If you liked the first - stop there. I wish I had.
B00004WKII|1.0|This box set is a mixed bag of live material, much of it re-released, and unreleased studio material. The studio material, while providing some insight into Hendrix' creative process, is primarily composed of unfinished demos of works-in-progress, and does not hold a candle to the finished studio works. All in all, this is among the least impressive material ever released in Hendrix' name. It still blows away most new music.
0553106635|5.0|Martin has returned to the heights he reached in A Game of Thrones with this tremendous work.  This book has greater emotional depth (exploring the perversions and impulses of Jaime Lannister and his family), character development (Tyrion and Jon especially) and momentous events than virtually any other mid-series volume in print.  The action in the second half is tremendous, while the description of the bleak torn lands of Westeros is vivid throughout the novel.  <br />Martin is not averse to killing off (literally) major characters.  In a Storm of Swords, many major players meet their demise and others meet a different doom. Be prepared for the cliff-hanger ending that sets up the last 3 books in the series.  That said, this series is on its way to eclipsing every fantasy series (except Tolkien, of course) in terms of scope, complexity, skill, intrigue and readability.
0380788624|4.0|Stephenson attacks the technology in his books with an amazing amount of detail when he creates fantastical devices.  This holds true in Cryptonomicon even though all the toys in this book are real.  This book is a bulky read, which is what holds it back from a 5 star rating, and I felt that at some points Stephenson discusses masturbation for too long a period of time, which slowed the pace of the novel, but ultimately it is very enjoyable and should be picked up by anyone with the patience for a long read.  I found it fascinating and hard to put down, even though there are two or more distinct plotlines and two distinct eras during which the book takes place.  Worth a look, or two.
B00004THAY|1.0|I love both of these musicians.  I was really disappointed in this CD, though.  The recording quality is mediocre -- sounds like it was done in their garage.  The songs are all too slow and too long, with simply no variety to keep your interest.  I'd definitely recommend you go with either artist's other recent releases instead.
0312955006|5.0|Connelly is a great writer.  I've picked up a few of his books with some trepidation, such as the Poet or Void Moon and I always find myself pleasantly surprised.  The Concrete Blonde is the territory where I feel more comfortable, it is the world of Harry Bosch, Connelly's usual protaganist.  The novel is a brilliant combination of courtroom action and slick detective work peppered with just enough police lingo to immerse the reader in a realistic world without losing them in lots of technicalities.  This book delves into past events mentioned in earlier Bosch novels while not alienating new readers.  Gritty and poetic, Connelly exceeded my expectations with this book.  A must for hard-boiled detective fans, mystery readers, and Connelly fans.

0060987464|5.0|I am a fan of Manson's music, but it was with much trepidation that I read this book.  Two things concerned me: One, would this be some stupid, purposefully shocking book with little or no real value and poor writing, or, two, that I would read things about Manson's life and see things about him that would detract from my enjoyment of his music.  Luckily, neither one of these things happened to be true.  The book is very well written and reveals things that actually increased my enjoyment of Manson's music.  This book is at times very deep and moving, and at times simply informative about Manson's life and early career.  I enjoyed it immensely and have read it several times, sometimes underlining fascinating passages.  Definately worth reading for Manson fans and maybe even for people who have never heard the music.  Certainly of higher grade than any of those typical unauthorized biographies and publicity books.
6304698658|1.0|&quot;Full Screen&quot; means half the movie has been cut.  While the movie earns at least 4 out of 5 stars, the insensitivity of producers of this DVD version is astounding.  Even my low budget DVD player has the option of forcing a widescreen movie (16:9 aspect) to fit my 4:3 TV screen, so what sense is there in not releasing the DVD in widescreen?<br />Even if the producers felt that this film was not worthy of widescreen, or that some views would have trouble with player options, then at least distribute it as a double-sided (wide/full) DVD.  Same goes for the other &quot;Vacation&quot; DVDs currently for sale, which (by the way) should be collected into a box set.
0312952813|4.0|Connelly shows improvement here from his last book, Black Echo.  Fun and exciting, Connelly balances the mystery with the deeply personal aspects of Bosch's life.  Connelly paints a dark picture of LA, and a seedy picture of a down and out cop's life.  Like most of Connelly's books, the twists and turns keep coming.  This  book is less contrived than the last and Connelly shows no signs of slowing down.  Definately worth your time.
B00003000M|3.0|This is not the best &quot;update&quot; of Bob's works that could have been produced.  More care should have gone into choosing artists that could deal with reggae, which many of the rap arists on the CD obviously can't do.  Aerosmith should have not been included either.  What a waste of time!<br />There's a lot of squawking about the references to &quot;thugs&quot; Tupac and biggie.  Well, all the hippy-dippy peace and love people should put down the spliff, sober-up, and remember that Bob was a thug too!  Please do just a little reading...the man was no saint!  Open your eyes and get real.<br />I love Bob, and his music, (and the originals are still the best) but I'm getting tired of the deification of him and his family. I don't agree with many of the opinions here that his music is somehow so &quot;legendary&quot; that it can't be reinterpreted. Interpret away, but do a more consistent job than &quot;Chant Down Babylon&quot;  Oh yeah, and please leave off crap tracks like &quot;Kinky Reggae&quot; and &quot;Roots Rock Reggae.&quot;  These are two of Bob's most worthless songs, and for some reason people insist on putting them on &quot;Best of...&quot; collections.  I guess its simple songs for simple minds...<br />Best tracks - &quot;Black Survivors&quot; &quot;Turn Your Lights Down Low&quot; &quot;Guiltiness&quot;
0312958455|5.0|Connelly writes in a darkly poetic manner which serves this book very well.  This novel reveals more about Bosch's past than any of the earlier books, and it allows readers, old and new, to see Bosch in a new light, while weaving an interesting, heartfelt story coupled with an edge-of-your-seat mystery as Bosch delves into the past and investigates the now ancient but never closed murder of his own mother.  Every obstacle only pushes Bosch further into the case and hardens his determination.  I found myself sucked in very early and I hung on until the very end.  Astoundingly good.
B000002BQK|5.0|Although this album has been out for 3 years it is still my most played album.Every song on this album is incredible but my favs are the roof breakdown and my all all of which display incredible songwriting and some of the best vocal ive ever heard. even if you dont like mariah you will love this cd you wont be sorry.
0811826848|5.0|After reading &quot;Anthology&quot;, I've gone back and read some of the other noteworthy Beatle books.  The others just don't compare to &quot;Anthology's&quot; from-the-horse's-mouth perspective.  Sure, it's probably been sanitized a bit by the authors, but it's still a wonderful read.
0553106635|5.0|Move over Robert Jordan, George R.R. Martin has captured the prize.  Can one actually salivate thinking of this great tale?  Not since I read Lord of the Rings for the first time has my heart beat this fast while reading.  O.K., I'll admit that I have stuck with the Wheel of Time waiting for the great tale to reemerge that was begun in the Eye of the World.  But nine has got to be the limit.  Ser Martin has shown that you can have substance and intricacy without a Britannica length story.   I am absolutly stunned when a major character (or so I thought) says goodbye.  What a twist!  This certainly has kept me on my toes while savoring every bit of this juicy feast of imagination.  If your trying to decide whether to invest or not all I can say is that this is the first time I've contemplated staying home from work just so I can keep reading.
0380788624|5.0|one of the better novels in any genre i've read in long time. Who would have thought that even linux could seem compelling?
B00004ZAV3|5.0|the cd is great - really. but the problem is that these songs are not their best.  by white album or abbey road instead
B00004ZB9D|4.0|Although I like many of his singles, I had never bought a Lenny Kravitz CD because none of his albums have had enough good songs to justify a purchase. Until now. This greatest hits compilation shows Lenny's remarkable range - from hard rock to soul to funk - and the variety keeps it fresh for the listener.<br />Now if the Black Crowes would release a &quot;best of&quot; disk...
B000024QML|5.0|A landmark album. The dance-pop equivalent of 'Pet Sounds' or 'Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'
0553573403|5.0|Unlike other books of its genre, this one trys to portray a world without embellishment. There is no pure evil and there is no definite good. Everything is in between and does things for according reasons. An example is if a king is murdered it is not because the murderer serves some dark god or evil overlord it is because he or his boss stands to profit from the death.<br />A lot of little things like that are what makes this a great book. Also the lack of obvious magic thus far is a great draw. A book like this doesn't really need magic of that sort.<br />The other thing that this book lacks to my relief is archetypes that show up in every single fantasy book. There are a few characters that are close to fitting the mold but far less than would be expected.<br />This book in a way is all about politics but not the kind that we are used to seeing on the glass screen. Politics that are as deadly as any war are what this book contains yet is not what one would think by reading the above sentence.<br />Yet despite or because of the differences between this and other books it remains a read that is pleasurable and will pass the time away.
B00003CX9W|3.0|Don't get me wrong -- this film is fantastic, and by itself it rates 5 stars. But this DVD edition is not all its cracked up to be.<br />First, there's the editing in the Pastoral Symphony, as noted by other reviewers. This is nothing new -- that editing was originally done back in the 60s -- but it makes for some very grainy frames in an otherwise beautiful print.<br />Then there's the re-dubbing of Deems Taylor's parts. As I understand it, this was necessary because the original soundtrack was missing for parts of the extended interstitials. However, I can't believe that they couldn't find a better voice match for Taylor, given the wealth of voice talent in Hollywood these days. If you're used to the original, the difference is kind of jarring.<br />My biggest gripe, though, is the apparent re-mixing of the music. The original soundtrack was full-on surround sound (what Disney called Fantasound) that had the music literally surrounding the viewer, often sweeping about the room to follow movement on the screen. The 1990 theatrical and video releases  contained this Fantasound mix, but the DVD seems re-mixed as a static symphony recording, with the rear channels carrying only reverb. The sound is a bit cleaner than the last go-round, but it's far less dramatic. And the differences are noticable even in plain stereo.<br />All of these things add up to considerably less than a faithful rendering of this film. The editing is understandable since racial stereotypes are unacceptable these days, but the rest is a shame, and hard to understand in view of Disney's usual attention to detail.<br />As I noted, the film itself is well worth seeing, and aside of the editing, it has never looked better. But the original laserdisc/VHS release is far more interesting.
0783229526|3.0|First off, I am not familiar with any of the writings that gave birth to this movie, so I can't write a review based on how well the film adapted from its roots. I can comment from the perspective of someone who had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch the film. The film wastes absolutely no time in starting the mind-bending narcotic adventure that is rampant throughout the rest of the film. A lot of the humor and interaction that occurs between the characters in the movie has to be separated in a sense between what is drug-based honesty and introspect to what is drug-based sillyness and misadventure.<br />The first half of the movie is enjoyable on the lighter side, with the beginning of the binge of binges drawing out some rather interesting behaviors and antics from the two main characters, played to intruiging perfection by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. As the movie progresses, however, the mood becomes very dark, the trip less enjoyable, and at some points it was hard to keep my attention to the movie. It was just that hard to watch. In a sense, though, I think that it may have been intentionally captured in a subtle and unique fashion by the film makers...the essence of the drug rampage that starts with euphoria and petty irresponsibility works more and more in a maddening and destructive way as the marathon continues. The moodiness, the inability to concentrate, and the post-&quot;peak high&quot; aftermath are everywhere in the second half of the film, which is very sobering in one sense, but extremely unentertaining to watch for the most part. But, as noted before, maybe that was by design.
B000051VWW|4.0|I think she has a great voice. But I think she have a very monotonous CD. The songs are regular, not the singer.
6305627401|3.0|As a fan of the original series by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, I really enjoy the blatant fashion in which the characters mock society with the way they act and behave. The way the messages are dished out en masse to us are all at once hilarious for the sheer gall and ease in which it comes out from the characters, unnerving for the fact that its accepted this kind of humor isn't for everyone (you don't want the wrong people buying too much into this), and saddening because most of the misfortune and extremely politically-incorrect humor is simply a mirror of the non-sense that occurs in society without most people realizing it. To explain this point a little better, the feature plot to the movie revolves around a small PTA's fight to destroy Canada because they disagree with the silly toilet humor of two of their citizens: Terrence and Philip. Its funny because its not uncommon for organizations to fight against such issues, especially in the United States, but to the point of genocide and war is an extreme that is so out there it gets a laugh. Its unnerving because the way the organization is characterized is comedic but can be easily interpreted as a negative sentiment about such organizations as the PTA, and for that reason it really is saddening. Saddening because, when you take a step back and examine how these organizations really work, a lot of them really are that fanatic, a lot of the fights are led by people who are good-natured but are corrupted by their own ignorance to the issues they fight against. That however, is another rant all in itself.<br />A lot of the humor is very transparent, a lot of it based on the profanity which is laced in almost every sentence that is spoken in the movie. A lot of the humor, as I noted above, can be interpretive as well. The way people act is both comedic but is also a direct mock-up of society.<br />The only reason why I didn't like this movie was the musicals. They are enjoyable at some points, but seem to interruptthe movie at others, and are completely forced upon us at other times. In all, I recommend the movie, but I also recommend showing extreme discretion as to who watches it with you.
078401213X|1.0|I did not like this movie in the least.   It was a chore to watch and find the point. I had to stop the movie 3/4 of the way through and go to bed I was so bored.
6304806442|5.0|Easily one of the best films of the 1990s, &quot;Trainspotting&quot; centers around a group of youngsters who are controlled by their addiction to heroin. Set in Scotland, where the youth in question live on welfare money to support their habits, the main character Renton (played brilliantly by Ewen McGregor) decides to give kicking the habit another shot, and in the process of trying to sober himself he watches his life, and the lives of his friends, fall apart all around him.<br />There is an inescapable feeling of a loss of hope that emenates from just about every character in the movie. Such external factors as economy, lack of direction, lack of self-control, and fear of almost all things, including cheating thir bodies' craving and having to go through withdrawal, are all telling factors in how they each respond to the different obstacles they face throughout the movie.<br />The movie is definitely not without its funny points, and the dry humor that is seemingly rapid-fired by the characters as they engage in their normal activities of mischief hold substantially more comic value than is seen in most comedies these days.<br />The feeling of closure in the movie is very ambiguous for me. On one hand, you can definitely see a chapter of someone's life come to an end in a disheartening but nonetheless necessary fashion. On the other, the path ahead for the individual has a very &quot;Lady or the Tiger&quot; feel to it, although I'm sure the writers would have us believe that things end in a very good way. After watching the movie, it's not a hard thing to credit.
0887306101|5.0|Great book. The one who wants to become a good trader must first listen to masters. And that what makes these (and The New Market Wizards) books so unique. I understood all my mistakes from the second reading of the book. Plan to read it third time and perhaps more in the future. Gems are often overlooked first time. Book is full of gems. I also suggest to make a bookmarks as you go. Then refer to them. There are common things to all great traders in the world. Common principles they follow and common mistakes they are avoiding. And the best way to discover them - is in this book.
0375703764|5.0|I just received my Bachelor's Degree in English and of everything I studied while in school, this novel, by far, is the most interesting thing I read while in college (although I had to find it myself).  I predict that within ten years (perhaps sooner), this novel will be studied in colleges and universities across the nation -- and well it should!<br />Danielewski has written a marvelous debut!  What I found to be the most intriguing aspect of the novel was that in the house, that the characters never quite feel safe in -- the rooms are always changing --, there is nothing solid for the characters to cling to (perhaps this is why Navidson's son, Chad, spends most of his time outside the house).  This lack of a something solid to hold onto was expertly mirrored in the page layout.  For most novels, we can grab an iced tea or hot cocoa (depending on the weather) and settle into an overstuffed chair perhaps with a blanket over our legs and settle into a familiar and comfortable story with the friends we meet in our novel.  Danielewski, in constantly shifting the page layout and forcing the reader to work to read the story (flipping pages, turning the book around, the extensive footnotes, etc.), takes away the comfortable &quot;falling into the book&quot; feeling most novels give us.  We, as readers, have nothing solid to grasp just like the characters in the novel.<br />This is only Danielewski first novel, so it is exciting to anticipate what he will bless his readers with in the future.  Danielewski has made a bold entrance to the literary scene.  He hasn't just pushed the envelope with this novel, he has knocked it off the table.
0375704027|5.0|I was keeping this book for a friend from out of town who didn't want to carry it during his short trip after he bought it. I decided to take the advantage. It ended up like this: I wouldn't let the book down even when I was eating my breakfast. This is the first book I read from Murakami and I purely loved it. The sculpture of each character was deep and thorough with imaginable but moving trace of life. Every instance seems to push the reality to the edge with the right personality and the right condition, forcing the readers to fall for it uncontrollably. Besides being influential, it's also exposing the raw truth bravely. With characters being suicidal or even died at a young age, the book doesn't seem to be dark and depressing all the time, rather was lightened up once in a while by clues such as the faithful and pure love story of Toru and Midori, which ends the book with promise.  The credit to Jay Rubin, the translator, could never be diminished. It never occurred to me during the whole reading that the book is merely a translation. The elegancy and fluency of its language throughout the book was just overwhelming.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This movie was made for DVD. It was better watching at home on DVD than in the theater.  The sound is great, the picture is perfect and being able to rewind is priceless.   My girlfriend who doesn't watch action movies stayed awake for the whole show and that is the highest rating I can give.
6301966562|4.0|Miles, the nerdiest of nerds, buys a computer, overloads it with info from work, dumps wine on the keyboard and soon, this computer has a mind of its own.

B00004XOWM|1.0|You don't need to hear this album to know that it is definately only for people who are to uneducated in music to appreciate.  Just take their single 'Rollin' ' The second chorus shows why Fred Durst should stick to paperwork at his cushy exec. job.  I beleive they go &quot;You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit?  You can't mess with Limp Bizkit. (why?}  Because we get it on. (when?)&quot;  Probuably took him about 38 seconds to write that! <br />I also thought it was funny how Fred Durst and Creed's lead singer were feuding this year.  Two worst bands feuding i thought it was funny at least. By the way guys, great title for an album.  What's next:   &quot; Banana Microphones and our sour sounding music.&quot;

B00000J6AG|5.0|With 10 years in the music wilderness pumping out quality tunes like Go, Moby may have been forgiven for giving up music and living off what little royalties he had gained. Luckily for us he didn't and instead decided to show us how a great album should sound. <br />The first half of Play is much stronger than the second half but this isn't a bad thing. With memorable songs like Find My Baby, Honey and South Side at the start you are instantly entrapped in Moby's genius like world and this is further confirmed by the hughe hits Porcelain and Natural Blues as well as the utter classic Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad. <br />With a start like this at first the rest is a little disappointing at first but the more you listen the more you appreciate it and understand the more downbeat melancholic music which lets you unwind after a strenuous start and you grasp its true quality.<br />Every song here has its own distinct identity yet the all combine together to produce an amazing album and undoubtably one of the classic albums of the late 90's and one which is a must.

What can be said that hasn't already been said - pretty much nothing but that doesn't stop you speaking of how great they were and this CD showcases what a band they really were with all 27 of their UK and US No 1 hits.<br />Listed in chronological order to no doubt please the chart buffs out there all the songs are of extremely high quality with only about five not in stereo sound. <br />With such memorable classics such as She Loves You, I Want To Hold Your Hand and the timeless Yellow Submarine every song has its place as an all time great.<br />My favourites are the later songs such as Let It Be, All You Need Is Love and Hey Jude as i feel their songwriting got stronger as they went on and these three possibly higlight this most of all.<br />There is one song which i dislike however which is The Ballad Of John and Yoko and this just doesn't have the irresistable charm to it as the others but there is also a real gem in Hello Goodbye as it just sounds great.<br />Looking at it, it is a great introductory to the Beatles but it merely scratches at the surface of pop's greatest and in my opinion there is no substitue for buying the original albums but i would rate the red and blue albums of greatest hits above this as they feature more songs overall but this doesn't detract in any way the quality of this album.<br />Excellent.
B00003CXBK|4.0|This is one of the few movies I've watched where there was never a clearly defined villain.  The main conflict (forgive me if I stay general because I don't want to give anything away) in the movie is between humans that are fighting for land to mine and the forest that is protected by animal gods.  The animal gods fiercely defend the forest from any invasion by man and man continues to invent ways to help annex more of the forest by any means necessary.  The animation has some absolutely amazing sequences but has a PG-13 rating for a reason.  Some of the battle and after battle scenes are very gory.  This movie is not meant to be seen by young viewers.  I can honestly say I've never seen anything quite like it and can easily recommend it to any animation or anime fan that is 13 or older.
0446525537|2.0|so what,I didn't cry. I'm not a heartless person,mind you,I read 'the notebook' and cried alot but this book...well...didn't quite follow up.I think the writer tried too hard to make this book..sad..but it's not! the most emotional scene for me is when Landon and Jamie exchange christmas gifts and that's all.I'm bad at writing review and I don't want to criticize too much, but having the girl died from leukemia at the end of the story, come on! what is this,erich segal's? I have to say this is disappointing. (ok, sorry for criticized too much)

B00003CXE7|5.0|Without a doubt the best movie of 2000, and an Oscar contender. All aspects of this movie are gorgeous-the scenery, acting, soundtrack, costumes, I could go on but see it and you'll understand.
B000050XEI|5.0|Though this CD might be short, it is definitely worth every penny.  It enchants, enlivens, brightens, and relaxes your day.  It starts off with &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;, a song closely akin to &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, with ethereal vocals and a strong piano line.  &quot;Wild Child&quot; is an easily accessible pop-like number along the same vein as &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot;.  The pizzicato strings sound as fresh as ever here, and Roma Ryan, Enya's lyricist, seems to be broadening her horizons with slightly more experimental lyrics.  &quot;Only Time&quot; is hypnotic, with a slow 4/4 rhythm and dreamy vocals.  In the interludes of phoenetic singing, the bass line has a small change in between phrases that gives the song added magic.  &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; is a heavy, latin song which has a very Gothic, ominous feel.  It brings your mind into a dimension of storminess and cloudiness, but it makes you glad to be there.  The only problem with this song is that it ends too soon.  It seems there should be more afterward.  A sweet ballad sung in Gaelic, &quot;Deora Ar Mo Chroi&quot; soothes the soul and mind, and combines Enya's haunting solo vocal with multiple overdubbed interludes.  &quot;Flora's Secret&quot; is a quickly moving waltz where Enya's voice almost soars atop the string section, chiming along.  I can picture a lawn of couples dancing to this song at an outdoor wedding.  &quot;Fallen Embers&quot; consists of Enya's vocals on top of the mix, instead of buried within it with many overdubs.  It shows she has genuine vocal talent and doesn't need to hide within layers of studio production.  This ballad seems to be a follow-up (and improvement) on &quot;Paint The Sky With Stars&quot;.  &quot;Silver Inches&quot; is a stunning but all to brief instrumental tune with pizzicato strings and a soft, background string section.  &quot;Pilgrim&quot; is another ballad that features Enya's voice up front in the mix.  &quot;You cannot change what's over, but only where you go...&quot;, she sings, and the music fits it exactly.  &quot;One By One&quot; is another upbeat song, which has a beautiful chorus section.  It is similar to &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, where the verses are major in key yet the chorus seems to be minor in key.  My all time favorite on this CD, and perhaps one of my all time favorite songs period, is the closing track &quot;Lazy Days&quot;.  It begins like a typical Enya song, and the verses are very pretty with sweet harmonies and an energetic string section.  But when the chorus hits: BAM!  It becomes so hypnotic and pulling you feel you are on a boat on the ocean letting the waves rock away your problems.  Very effective and very powerful.  This CD will definitely be in my player for months, or even years to come.y where you go...&quot;, she sings, and the music fits it exactly.  &quot;One By One&quot; is another upbeat song, which has a beautiful chorus section.

6304119046|5.0|Ok, this is considered widely as the best film ever made, so why isn't it on DVD yet? Is the movie industry still confused at what to make of this amazing film which was way ahead of it's time in 41' and probably still is? When considering how many terrible movies are being put in the DVD format today, it's a disgrace to see Kane only in VHS. Even Welles great B movie Touch of Evil made it on DVD, so why isn't his best flick?
B000002N3N|5.0|The anthemic title track begins &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot;, her fourth CD release.  Wordless vocalizations and forceful percussion propel this song into the stratosphere.  &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, the lead single from this CD, is typical of her earlier fare like &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;, but contains a magic all its own.  The most endearing aspect of this song is its lyrics.  Roma Ryan, Enya's long time lyricist, deserves much credit for her amazing lyrics on this song.  Relax and fall into the images the music and the words make together.  &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is like a hurricane to me.  It begins ominously, like the calm before the storm.  It builds into a frighteningly wicked storm of immense proportions with strings and drums and vocals everywhere. Then, in the middle, it stops, and small lull transpires while angels come down and sing to us.  Then, just as suddenly, the wind comes up again and we are back into the thick of things.  And then, the end comes as suddenly as the beginning.  &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a beautiful ballad which is more lyrical than any other ballad Enya has produced thus far.  In this song, Enya sounds very similar to her sister, Maire Brennan, lead singer of the group Clannad.  &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is another solo piano piece, which embodies the title perfectly.  I can picture myself staring at the wide expanse of the ocean or the land from a high cliff.  &quot;China Roses&quot; is a song of love and a song of the past.  You can feel the slow moving but intensely powerful energy in the undercurrent of this song.  Beautiful synthesized sounds add to the atmosphere here.  &quot;Hope Is A Place&quot; sounds melancholy, like someone has given up hope, and Enya is trying to tell them that it's not too late, it's never too late.  For all in love, hope has a place in YOUR soul.  This is such a sweet ballad with a simplistic arrangement.  &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot; is another instrumental track which embodies its title perfectly.  The sparkling synthesizers and melodies bring to mind a late evening tea ceremony underneath a bright full moon on a late summer's eve.  &quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a soft waltz, a lament, if you will, of something had and lost, here and gone.  &quot;La Sonadora&quot; is the only Enya song to be written in Spanish, and includes some unusual but effective chord changes.  A song to relax by.  &quot;On My Way Home&quot; starts off with a slow organ introduction and moves into a complex bassline as Enya travels on her journey home.  It seems as if your mind walks while listening to this song, with a stop in the bridge as sweet flutes massage your tired mind.  A fabulous way to end a fabulous CD.ctly.

B00003CXGG|4.0|There are people out there that seem to have gotten the wrong impression about this movie: that it's Jet Li's show.  Well, it's not.  And once you get over that, you'll find this to be a very good, though formulaic (in the Shakespearian sense) movie that has everything people ask for.  There is love (eh, I guess it's love), fighting (eh, it's really the computer fighting for them), feuding families (yes, they are kind of feuding), and in the end the boy gets the girl or they become really close friends.  Something like that.  But you see this movie for the action, not the sappy sweet lovey dovey thing.<br />I liked this DVD.  If it wasn't in such a format, I wouldn't suggest buying it--a VHS tape with just this movie is not worth it.  Luckily, the DVD has all kinds of fun things to do around the movie.  There are two videos with it of Aaliyah, so how can you go wrong?
0800141660|5.0|I have to admit to being a HUGE Emma Thompson fan, and also someone who enjoyed reading classics in high school.  That being said, I really feel this adaptation is one any lover of romance can enjoy. The characters are all believable - the older daughter who has to be reasonable and help keep her family going, and the younger, romantic sister who wants to fall in love with a handsome man who quotes poetry to her and takes her on picnics. <br />The adaptation is not faithful - many items were changed to make the story more accessible - but even purists will be charmed at how well the story plays. Alan Rickman is great as the older suitor who loves Marianne and wishes her the best, even if that means she goes with another man he doubts the worth of. <br />If you have a DVD player it's even better - the DVD version has several separate audio tracks that let you hear the actor and directors thoughts while watching the movie. You'll be amazed at the kinds of insights you learn! <br />Definitely a DVD on my shelf that is watched often.
B00004Y87J|5.0|The beginning of the Hitchcock legend. A black and white classic that contains many of the elements that Hitch later used in such films as Saboteur and North by Northwest. The blonde goddess heroine, the innocent man on the run and the mysterious McGuffin; in this case it's secret airplane plans that the spy ring must get out of the country. Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll are the first of the great Hitchcock romantic teams. A film that has suspense, comedy and romance blended together in a way that today's movies can only dream of. Altogether, an early masterpiece!
B00000J7J4|5.0|Santana has always been a favorite of mine. I grew up to Black Magic Woman and Oye Como Va. I was thrilled when this latest version came out and won popular acclaim. It has brought these fantastic musicians back into the spotlight which is incredibly well deserved.<br />I love &quot;Smooth&quot;, which is the song that gets them the most radio play, but the other songs are equally as great to listen to. There is a good diversity of styles, partially because they have different key musicians working with them, and partially because of the range of styles they have explored over the years.<br />A must-have for any Santana lover, and a great introduction for anyone who doesn't have any Santana CDs yet!
0441172717|5.0|Book Review<br /> I usually do not consider literature as a favorite pass-time but sometimes there are books that cannot be put down until you your eyes are sore tired, and Frank Herbert's Dune is one of them.  Although the book is in the science fiction genre, it is a great pick for anyone who appreciates a good story, and the book also includes quit a bit of mystery and romance which fits in perfectly in the world that grips you in and does not let go even after you are done with the book.   I am a big fan of the science fiction genre, especially the Start Trek and Star Wars series.  Actually most of my reading revolved around those two names, so when I stumbled upon Dune, I was not very enthusiastic to say the least.  The book was large and very long (almost made turn away right there), complicated, and dated, but since I did not find anything new in the two categories mentioned above, I picked it up to pass my time   during the holidays, and because I like to spend my free tome in front of my computer I though that I might not even start on the book, boy was I wrong.  I started reading during the second week of the not so long holiday.  I was instantly possessed by the storyline, which was impossible to predict but satisfied with what it revealed to you.  The story is a bout a Royal Family Atreides who has to leave their paradise of a planet to govern a desert planet, which is full of the most valuable substances in galaxy.  The story twist from there on into betrayals, mystery, romance and finally revenge.        I finished the book in less than three days, and the book was almost five hundred pages long.  I had little time to do anything during those three days, and I must admit I was never that devoted to a book before.  The best part about is the ending.  It ends the story in passion able way, and although one can draw a conclusion with it, it acts a lot better as an opener to the continuation of the saga.  In fact the book created four sequels (I am alreadyinto the second book in the serious) and prequel.  The reason for all deviation/continuations is due to a very high critical success of the book and enormous sales that it generated, in fact all of the sequel and the recent prequel have scored very well with the fan base.  Due to the big popularity of the book, there was a motion picture created based on the book back 1989, and featured some big stars such Sting himself (I did not know that he acted either), but did not do the book justice and failed in the box office, and it was very recently recreated a six hour special edition show on the Sci-Fi channel, and although a much better than the first was still somewhat out of place.  I guess some things have to be left to your imagination.
B0000024S0|5.0|&quot;The Times They Are A-Changin'&quot; is Bob Dylan's dark 1964 all-acoustic folk protest album that has gone down in history.  The opening title track explains it all- the times were changing.  Pop culture took a huge revolution in the early-mid sixties.  The record carries an assortment of dark parables (&quot;Hollis Brown&quot;, &quot;North Country Blues&quot;, &quot;Hattie Carroll&quot;), well-told histories (&quot;With God On Our Side&quot;), and two love songs to break the mood, the lovely &quot;Boots of Spanish Leather&quot; (the same melody as &quot;Girl of North Country&quot;), and &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot; a beautiful ballad sung so gently that you begin to wonder if Dylan was afraid that he was being too painful with his sharp criticism of the society.  &quot;Only A Pawn In Their Game&quot; is one of Dylan's best and the best songs ever written, a phenominal anti-racial tale which introduced me to my public nickname, Medgar Evers- (I'm a caucasion who's never been fired at; I just liked the name, and it's from one of my favourite songs).  And &quot;When The Ship Comes In&quot; is a jaunty folk song about the coming of Christ, also very well-written.  Now this must seem to be a bunch of nonsense to you if you don't know the album or songs.  But buy it; it's worth it.  The amazing music of the Greatest Solo Artist of Rock and Roll lives on!<br />&quot;Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught. They lowered him down as a king. But when the shadowy sun sets on the one that fired the gun, he'll see by his grave, on the stone that remains, carved next to his name, his epitaph plain: Only a Pawn in Their Game.&quot;

0679879269|5.0|I was amazed at this final addition to the Dark Materials Trilogy; I found it simply impossible to put it down.  Honestly.  I stayed up untill 6:30 in the morning today reading this book.  It is complex, with an intricatly woven plot, and the entire story is of a quality that I have never experienced before.  The characters draw in the reader, and the plot is so imaginative that it is unlike anything ever before created.  This book, as well as its predecessors, is full or adventure, excitment, danger, and creatures that capture the imagination and bear it up on silver wings.  I know that doesn't tell you much about the actual book, but I can't bear to spoil it's amazingness for future readers. I will warn readers, though, the ending is incredibly sad; I was literally sobbing. This added to the story completely, though, and this is by far the best book I have, in my 16 years, ever read.
B000006TRV|5.0|I work in radio, and I get paid to listen to music (God BLESS America!) and I have always found pleasure in being able to enjoy music by Pink Floyd...and 'The Wall' ranks up there in MY opinion as easily one of the top-10 best albums in rock music. While the debate rages over their inclusion into the pantheon of 'all-time best' I firmly believe that even after listening to 'The Wall' for the trillionth time, that Roger Waters has written a true modern audio masterpiece.  And like most albums you buy and have to skip the 'lesser known' tracks that don't achieve the greatness of some of the songs, with 'The Wall' you just slip the CD in, hit play and enjoy all-the-way-through.<br />Like many fans of Pink Floyd, my first REAL introduction to their music came from the repetitious airplay of 'Another Brick In The Wall Part II' and I'd apologize for the over-play of that tune, but I NEVER got tired of hearing it.  But there was so much MORE to this incredible album.  'Run Like Hell' &amp; 'Hey You' are just two examples of songs that compel you to listen.  And of course 'Comfortably Numb', without a doubt one of 'Floyds' greatest musical pieces.  If you are a fan of this band, and you DON'T have 'The Wall' in your collection, it is high time you forked over the $ and sit back and enjoy some really great stuff.  Trust me, this is rock music that WILL endure.
B00004U8H4|5.0|Patrick Bateman, the yuppie serial killer du jour created by Bret Easton Ellis, is obsessed with all things superficial. Ellis' written world is full of super-attractive young men with secret killer ways. He wallows in his protagonist's masochistic behavior and only occasionally manages to step back and comment on his behavior on a larger scale. Patrick Bateman is intended to be the metaphor for Reaganism on the kill but somehow this message is muddled amidst the non-stop name-dropping and unending detail that Ellis gives to Bateman's ritualistic killings.<br />Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) one-ups Ellis in just about every department with her screen adaptation. The fact that many designers did not grant Harron the permission to use their names in the film could have been a Godsend because it forces Harron to focus on the more relevant nuances of her character. Harron brilliantly establishes Bateman's attraction for all things narcissistic in a scene where he describes his daily facial rejuvenating process while standing in front of his bathroom mirror. If you combine that moment with Bateman's non-stop exercise regime and his desire to dine at the fanciest of restaurants, you have a Bateman that is concerned with nothing more than his own beautification.<br />The infamous threesome scene that slapped the film with an NC-17 rating is a great one because it shows Bateman, played with astonishing madness by Christian Bale, completely detached from the act of sex. Much like Ellis' portrait of Bateman, he is a man more concerned with performance than with the actual act of sex. While having sex with the women he looks at himself in the mirror. He is making love to himself, enjoying his muscular body as it masochistically berates the women.<br />Although Patrick Bateman is a completely loathsome soul, Harron appropriately adds a certain human element to her psycho killer. Even though Bateman admits over voice-over that he is devoid of any emotion there is a scene in the movie where we get a sense that he is seeking some sort of salvation from the world he has created for himself. After bringing his secretary (Chloe Sevigny) to his apartment, he has her leave after telling her that if she doesn't he might do something horrible to her.<br />Bateman's sadistic ways are certainly a product of some twisted childhood or adult experiences but Harron does not choose to focus on this. There is a tongue-in-cheek moment where Bateman apologizes to a dinner-date for being late by saying that he is a `product of divorce' but this is about the only glimpse we get into the character's pre-killer days. It's as if Harron is flippantly teasing us with the comment, knowing that we are itching for some sort of Freudian psychoanalysis of her character.<br />The gore is at a significantly lesser scale than one would be expected considering source material. Aside from one astonishingly executed sequence where a prostitute (Cara Seymour) flees from Patrick down some stairs, the killings in the film are handled in a comedic, albeit disturbing, way. The women in the film do not get much characterization but this is an appropriate thing when you consider that the film is shot through Bateman's eyes, a man that is little concerned with the motivations of his victims.<br />There is a moment at the end of Psycho's wonderful finale where the characters are watching a presidential address by Reagan. They blankly comment on the program and we basically learn that their lives will continue as is. I wish there were more of these moments because so much of Psycho's substance lies in the way that these men are seen as products of the society that was created under Reagan's America. Bateman's soul is one that is consumed by greed and it seems that he has been given a second chance by film's end. Whether he will take this exit or continue this masquerade is open to interpretation and perhaps dependent on whatever political shift should sway the nation.the movie where we get a sense that he is seeking some sort of salvation from the world he has created for himself.

B000002U82|5.0|I have found over the years working in radio that every year a new and younger crowd seems to 'discover' Pink Floyd for the first time.  It is one of the great paradoxes of our time that us 'old farts' and the youth of today can't agree on just about ANYTHING, especially in music---b-u-u-u-t we CAN agree on Pink Floyd.  Who woulda figured on THAT 28 years ago when 'Dark Side of The Moon' came out?  I know it continually mystifies me, but I cannot fault folks for listening to arguably one of the greatest rock bands of all-time.<br />Growing up in Oregon some friends and I would haul hay every summer and there was this pump house along the road out in a very rural part of Northwest Oregon that someone had painted an exact copy of the cover of 'Dark Side Of The Moon' and after seeing it day after day as we drove by it to the barn, I finally went out and bought the album (YES, on VINYL-no less) and immediately decided that THIS was what I wanted to listen to---ALL OF THE TIME.  I eventually wore out my copy, and years later I discovered the durability of CD's and thank heavens my copy is just as pristine today as it was when I bought it 10 years ago.<br />I don't know where to begin when it comes to the music...but this is one of those rare records where you don't have to skip songs because they aren't as good...nope...this is a keeper where EACH and EVERY song stands out in its own way, and has been SO popular over the years, it actually remained on Billboard's Hot 100 album sales for OVER 15 YEARS STRAIGHT!  I think that says a LOT about a band that over the years never truly received the respect they really had earned and deserved.  Make 'Dark Side Of The Moon' one of YOUR buys this year and start off the new Millennium with one of the greatest albums of all-time.
B000053VBL|5.0|Francois Truffaut's THE BRIDE WORE BLACK is an excellent gift of a film to fans of Hitchcock and even to the master himself. There are many nods to Hitch's films and you know Truffaut had done his homework while making the picture (by writing the definitive book on Hitch's films). What makes BRIDE WORE BLACK more than just mere homage is an elevation of suspense and a less stylized, blatant approach to the material. Truffaut does not sell his own cinematic soul and is able to present a terrific suspense story of his own. It was almost like Hitch's work turned inside out. Jeanne Moreau plays a miserable middle-aged woman, both suicidal and murderous, looking to avenge the death of her life-long companion and husband.<br />We see the murder of the husband repeatedly throughout the picture, studied from different angles and vantage points. He is assassinated on the steps of the church, while the thunderous 'wedding suite' plays rather ominously. We find out why she picks her victims the way she does and how they all relate to the slaying. This is one ticked off woman. Some of the murders echoed Hitch, one inspired by FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, another from NOTORIOUS. The scenes and &quot;borrowing&quot; that occur here are not as blatant as you may think, however. They are mostly inspirations and Truffaut puts his own spin on them, meshing them together or taking them apart and reassembling the elements. If you are a Hitch connoisseur, it is fun to interpret what Truffaut is doing with the master's vast material.<br />I was also struck by a feeling of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but with a woman as the main protagonist and the journey turned inside out. Of course, we get the character who has seen this person before and either leads to her capture or is on to her, a staple in Hitch flix. The ultimate homage is Bernard Herrmann's score (he was Hitch's right hand man for years). The 'wedding suite' is louder than usual, resonating evil, and the music as a whole is Herrmann's typical gothic work, brilliant and memorable. Truffaut extends Hitchcock by showing us in more graphic detail some of the killings and the relentless mission this woman is on is not stylized the least bit.<br />Check out the poisoning scene and tell me you don't see Ingrid Bergman looking at Claude Raines circling and bellowing in expressionistic ways. Trains are littered throughout the film, one on the lampshade of a young boy, another with Moreau riding on it. This is all great, but it transcends some of Hitch's work in many ways. The blood-curdling ending is one of the best I have ever seen in film, period. Considering BRIDE WORE BLACK was released in 1968, the horrific ending may have inspired HITCH of all people when he made FRENZY in 1972. Watch both and see if you know what I mean. This is a must see for foreign film fans as well.gothic work, brilliant and memorable.

B000001EUR|5.0|Having been a HUGE Scorpions fan since I heard their incredible, 'The Zoo' I bought this album the day it came out (yes, on vinyl...what's wrong with THAT??) and immediately found that my money was well spent.  The radio was already buzzing with 'Rock You Like A Hurricane' but there are some great tracks in this selection that never made it to the airwaves--but were every bit as good ('Bad Boys Running Wild' is just one example) but I have to admit, it was their ballad that totally surprised me.  Here you have a band that is NOT known for doing ballad's, and yet 'Still Loving You' is one of the best of the 80's.<br />I was such a HUGE fan of this band, it helped me to decide to get into radio where (thank the good Lord) I actually get PAID to LISTEN to music!  I also get extra perks like free concert tickets and backstage passes...and YES, I DID get the supreme opportunity to not just see, but MEET this great import from Germany.  They are amazingly laid back, and very much in touch with the fact that their success depends entirely upon US, the folks who buy their albums and fork out good money to see them in concert (well, not me exactly...) which I found to be very refreshing after seeing the absolutely stunning arrogance of some bands (which I won't say--but their name sounds like 'Rotley Rue'...).  I still believe that aside from their 'Greatest Hits' this remains The Scorp's best CD (yes, I DID eventually upgrade). Grab it, turn it up.  Listen and repeat.
B00000265X|5.0|This is the top album from a great (and very underappreciated) band!  The final countdown has been my favorite song for many years and is one of my favorite albums.  The ballads &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;Time has come&quot; are very touching and other songs like &quot;Rock the night&quot; and &quot;Cherokee&quot; are full of energy and are fun to listen to.  The guitars and keyboards compliment each other very well and Joey Tempest's voice is just sensational.  Europe was a band that had everything.
B00000I5Y6|4.0|Okay, as an admitted Kansas fan, I take issue with the noted absence of a few songs from the 'list' that SHOULD have been added, but since I cannot do anything about it, let's focus on what is good here, and that of course is a fairly good collection of great songs by a band that rarely received the notoriety they very much deserved.  Of course, what SHOULD be on the list of greatest rock songs of the 70's but 'Dust In The Wind' and 'Carry On'...let's face it, very FEW rock bands ever employed an orchestra in their music (I can't think of any offhand, but I suppose there are a few) but Kansas on the other hand used it and made it sound like it BELONGED there.  And durability, (most) of these songs have been able to stand the test of time and sound every bit as awesome today as they did when first released---something you CANNOT say about 95% of the music that has infested the radio in the past 10 years...<br />I have to also say, that despite the view that 'Play The Game Tonight' was a bubble-gum sell-out for radio airplay (which wasn't bad for me since I work IN radio) I found the song to be great.  One of the supreme advantages of working in radio is being able to not just listen to music and get PAID for it, but other perks involve free concert tix and backstage passes...I have seen my fair share of concerts over the years, and you would be amazed at which ones sound great live and who downright reeked...but Kansas was definitely one of the better live shows I was lucky enough to see.  While 'The Best of Kansas' doesn't include what I consider to be their all-time best, I CAN tell you that if you are a fan, you WILL feel the buy was worth it.
B000006SQ0|5.0|Barclay James Harvest never got the success they deserved. A shame, because they were easily on a par with their contemporaries - Genesis, Yes, etc. Live Tapes not only showcases the best songs from the Octoberon and Gone to Earth albums - the zenith period of the band's career - these songs actually benefit from the spacious live sound. Taking Me Higher is thus transformed from a cracking song into three minutes of sonic glory, while Poor Man's Moody Blues stretches the limits of orchestral grandeure. The vocal performances are spot on and the harmonies send goosebumps down my spine. Essential listening, I would say, for fans of symphonic rock.
B000005IRG|5.0|This was a big success in the 1970ies for guitar virtuoso Tom Verlaine. With his band Television he plays (relativ) light guitar rock. No glamrock, no hardrock, no bluesjamming, no extreme psychodelic-rock, but dry, melodic and a bit hypnotic rock. I think he was absolutely sure what he wanted, there is never a feeling of &quot;don't know what to play as next song&quot;, followed by a disapointing filler. Instead it's a clear, solid and consistent performance from start to finish. He didn't accept the 3 min limit of those days for songs either, if the song needed it, it just got longer. It's arrangement is sparse and the album is lightyears away from being overproduced. Instead, the playing is highly concentrated right to the point, with plenty of harmony and melody, not to mention their incredible skill. In that it is very effective. For me this results in a timeless masterpiece, so the release date is of no importance. If it comes to rock-guitar bands with a unique character, this sure is worth a try.
B00003CXE7|4.0|good movie. rather long, but the story kept you interested, so no complaints about that. great props and scenery and the story line was interesting. the action sequeces were full of energy however the only downfall as far as i'm concerned was the lack of grewsomeness (if thats a word). i'm not a blood loving type. not any more than the next person, however unlike movies like braveheart where the action was bloody like it would be in real life, the fights weren't quite as bloody as would be in real life. example, during one of the fights in the stadium, someone gets cut completely in half, but not alot of blood or guts. other than that...i'd definately recommend buying this movie.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Vol. 1-2 contains all the best songs from his peak years of 1974-1985.  Songs like &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot;, &quot;My Life&quot;, &quot;You May Be Right&quot;, &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, &quot;Anthony's Song (Movin' Out)&quot;,&quot;New York State Of Mind&quot;, &quot;Piano Man&quot; and &quot;Scenes From An Italian Restaurant&quot; are radio staples and timeless classics.  In fact, there isn't a weak spot on the album.  Even the two new songs, &quot;You're Only Human (Second Wind)&quot; and &quot;The Night Is Still Young&quot; are excellent and do not seem out of place.  The album is a must have for any music fan and obviously many people agree as it is one of the ten biggest selling albums of all time.
0804106304|4.0|In the beginning of the year I asked my step-mom to recommend a good book or novel to read for my free reading section in English class.  She recommended that I read Joy Luck Club, by Amy Tan.    I sat down one night and began reading it.  It was so incredibly hard to put down, but I had to I had school in the morning.  Personally I am one who enjoys reading short stories compared to long boring ones.    This book is comprised or many short stories from Chinese women who have experienced it all, from the war to death, from life to being the child in a home where you aren't wanted.  All the stories and women are centered around 1 think and that is a Mah Jong table.    The great thing about this book is any women can relate to the stories in it.  They can also relate to many of the characters and the decisions they face in the world today.  Also the way details are explained in this book is absolutely mesmerizing.  Sometimes you feel so connected to the book its almost as if you were in it.  It is a rare and mesmerizing novel that describes the love and misunderstanding that lies between two generations.    I would really only recommend this book to women, short story readers, and anyone interested in the culture and history between Chinese women today.  I enjoyed this book and I am sure anyone else would agree.
0375420525|5.0|i'm only 31 pages into it, and i'm glued! buy this book, it is the most mentally stimulating, basically the best fictional literature i have ever read!  absolutely amazing!  (buy the way, get the hardcover. it's worth it.)
0802130208|5.0|I was unfamiliar with the tragedy surrounding this book and its author, Mr. Toole, and I admit that if I had known the facts, I probably would not have read it (I'm a writer myself, and the worst fate I could imagine is a &quot;mercy Pulitzer&quot; for someone who did himself in because he couldn't sell his work. But I did read it, and I can assure you that the Pulitzer was most deserved: Dunces was one of the most pleasant reads I've had in many, many months. <br />The setting for the book is New Orleans, a place that I love and love reading about. But it's not a novel about New Orleans, it's a story about some very interesting people who're just trying to make it in this world as best they can. But it's no Steinbeck novel -- it's funny, warm, provocative and touching all at the same time. I rarely laugh out loud while reading a book, but this one had me doing so on several occasions. And there were times that I felt an overpowering sadness for the characters as they made their way in life.<br />There were times while I was reading this book that I'd think that Ignatius was me -- clumsy, pompous and just plain wierd at times -- but for all that, people seemed to accept him for just being... Ignatius. I suppose that's all any of can hope for. <br />The only bad part is that Mr. Toole is no longer with us. I'm going to miss Ignatius and his family and friends. Thank you, Mr. Toole, for a most pleasurable experience.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is maybe the best album I have ever heard. I have a discerning ear, enjoying music from Samuel Barber's 'Adagio For Strings,' to Korn's 'Freak on a Leash,' and everything in between. This is one of the best albums I have heard in awhile, especially for a 1st album. If this is a 1st, what's next? One can only hope their other albums do so well.
6305364613|2.0|This, most recent, attempt at bringing Shakespeare's classic romance to the big screen is only partially successful.  The cinematography is stunning, and the director's effort at updating the setting into the 1990s is well done.  However, Leonardo DiCaprio falls flat in his performance as Romeo.  In one of the most romantic scenes (Act I; scene V) Romeo first speaks to Juliet in a dialogue which begins &quot;If I profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this;&quot;  In his performance, DiCaprio runs through these line as though he was late for a meeting with his agent.  Offsetting DiCaprio's performance are several outstanding performances among the supporting cast, notably those of John Leguizamo as Tybalt and Harold Perrineau as Mercutio.  <br />An excellent film for use in an English or theater class to compare with the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli version.  Hard-core Shakespeare fans will be disappointed, but this film is worthwhile if only as an example of how not to perform Shakespeare.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|i really loved this movie and i think it's kinda humorous how one of the reviewers on here said to save your money for the nutty professor 2...i'm sorry, but what they said there was funnier than any of the material in the klumps. granted, this movie is really vulgar but i can't help but to love it. all in all, if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
0385495323|4.0|From the writer of &quot;Fermat's Enigma&quot; comes another lucid, mathematics-based history, this time of codes and cyphers.<br />Again, like his previous book, I was (despite scraping by/flunking all my college math courses) was able to easily follow his history of codemakers, codebreakers, and their endless intellectual battles for supremacy, complete with examples of how do make and break codes and cyphers.<br />Highly recommended.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Watching sleepy hollow was so fun. It keeps you hanging on an action-packed thrill ride.Itis well worth buying.You will watch it over and over. I believe it is one of tim burton best.But be sure to avoid the video tape,it is much better on DVD.
0385493622|4.0|I must first confess that higher math utterly escapes me (I got C-/D+ grades in college math), so I approached this book with some trepidation. <br />To my surprise, it turned out to be the first book on mathematics *which I could actually grasp*. Singh offers lucid, intelligible-to-the-layman explanations of the mathematical principles, techniques, methodologies, personalities, history, and problem-solving blind alleys involved in solving this centuries-old math problem. This is a mathematical detective story, and absolutely fascinating even to non-mathematicians.
B000020617|5.0|This is one of the few CD's I own that I can lsten to start to finnish.  It's nice to see that the art of melody has not been completely abandoned in the pop world.  The songs are effective, and yet do not overtly rely on standard formulae.  In addition, there is plentiful stylistic contrast between the tracks. I appreciate a band that doesn't take itself too seriously, or put more effort into their image than their music.  My favorite tracks:<br />2) Breakout - Attitude and velocity 3) Learn to Fly - The obvious flagship of the album.  It is the most formlua-driven, however it is also the most striking.  4) Gimme Stitches - The &quot;groove boost&quot; in the latter half packs a punch. 7) Live-In skin - Sheer power.  A volcano of sound. 8) Next Year - I appreciate this song for its combination of simplicity and effectiveness.
B00001NFCY|3.0|I like this album. I hate this album. I think Scott Stapp is a sincere brooder struggling with inner spiritual conflicts. I think Scott Stapp is a jerk who verbally insulted me at one of his concerts. Sometimes I can't get enough of this disk and other times I think if I hear &quot;Higher&quot; one more time I'm going to have to strangle my radio. Obviously I have mixed feelings. As a group, Creed is very talented for being so green. &quot;Arms Wide Open&quot; could make any mother cry. The lyrics are nicely mashed together to make moody yet meaningful rock songs. I just wish the lead singer would decide whether he's the Dhali Lama or Johnny Rotten.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Metallica have done us proud. From their early days of thrash metal they have greatly matured and it really shows in this epic bouble CD. Although when heard without the orchestra, the tracks seem completem, the orchestra brings them alive and adds so much power and depth. The two new tracks, No Leaf Clover and -Human, are incredible. No Leaf Clover is a definite contender for the best Metallica track of all time, and -Human is extremely powerful and the string section suits the track so well immediately before it starts to get heavy. The majority of the tracks have an orchestral intro which is so good. I could go on about this CD forever but I must stop. I cannot reccommend this CD highly enough. If you like music that has power, is beautifully put together and that is something special then your life will not be complete without this album.
6304288433|4.0|This movie is one of the best sequels I have ever seen! I really like the way the movie continues right after the first one. The first of this movie is really cool and suspensful! After Laurie enters the hospital, it gets a little bit more boring, but then later on the thrills build up again! That's the reason I gave it four stars instead of five. Jamie Lee Curtis had to wear a wig because she had changed her hair style! I thought that was funny. It is an awesome edition to the Halloween series.
B00000255X|5.0|Desire is great.  This album is the culmination of Dylan's evolution from folk-master to rock wizard.  The stylistic variety of the songs makes the album infinitely listenable even where the songwriting cannot achieve the mastery of Blonde on Blonde.  The songs are all still great and &quot;Hurricane&quot; is of course amazing and touching.  &quot;Mozambique&quot; sounds like a Jimmy Buffett song--in a good way.  This is a very interesting album.
6304873824|5.0|This was a great movie and had very interesting 3D animations.  Thalia was great singing in the spanish version.
B00003CWTI|1.0|After renting this movie, I felt the need to return to the video store and not only demand my money back but my hourly rate for the three hours I wasted as well.<br />This movie, sporting an excellent cast, had great potential.  The first ten minutes of the movie made me feel I was truly in for a great movie.  The next hour and a half kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for how the plots were going to come together.<br />While watching the last hour of this movie, it became obvious that they never would.  The dialog became slow and the characters lost their interest and the common theme that brings the movie together in the end is...<br />I so wish I could tell you how this movie ends just so you WON&quot;T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON IT!  All I can say is...when it rains, it pours!
B00000K3UU|5.0|To keep it simple, I am very sceptical about films when they are released. I never give a film a high score just because I like it, but this film is brilliant. Adam Sandler is a great comedian and screenplay writer and the whole cast fitted in nicely to the theme of the story.<br />I find it very hard to make any bad comment on the film. It is of such high quality that I find it is amazing. Sandler plays &quot;Sonny Koufax&quot; a thirty-two-year-old slob who intends on wasting his life with no job. He makes a living from the money he made in a cab accident and uses it for all worthless stuff. But then when his girlfriend says she's going to dump him if he doesn't grow up, he tries to sort things out by adopting a five-year-old boy (played by the adorably cute Cole and Dylan Sprouse, great actors to look out for) called Julian. Sonny's girlfriend dumps him anyway, for an older man, and Sonny finds it too hard to look after Julian. So Sonny tries to give him back to Social Services but to no avail. Just as Sonny grows close to Julian, with a very warm love, Social Services come knocking. Sonny goes to court and tries to get Julian back, but the judge will have none of that. Even though I tell you most of the story, you have to see it for yourself. <br />To say the least, a film well acted (Sandler does a great Sonny Koufax, and Cole and Dylan play their part even better) and well wrote. Tremendously funny and sad in parts. I remember when I first saw Big Daddy in the cinema, the response from the entire audience was breath-taking. I remember when Julian put up his hand when Sonny was crossing the road and he wanted him to hold his hand, people said &quot;awwww&quot; or &quot;how cute&quot;. And then people laughed their minds off at the most funny parts of film history.<br />This is an amazing film. Every home should have one, or two if you really like it. This is only a small review. If you want a bigger one, please email me at fiveoftwelve@ntlworld.ie<br />Great film...and the extra DVD features are superb. Buy it now!
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is the flagship of what I think a wonderful series on the \\"truth about money.\\" Although you can sense that the book is a simple compilation of the multiple sets of notes, it is still a good read. However, I would suggest skipping everything that Kiyosaki's co-author Lechter wrote. What a waste of paper! Not a single idea. I cannot wait to read his further books. Before reading, prepare yourself for a very rough ride.
B00000IGGA|5.0|engender a strange form of elitism in his fans ... whoever listens to the most abstract or bizzare album wins. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoy some of his more bizzare work highly -- Swordfishtrobones is excellent). So, because this album is more, dare I say, listenable to the average Joe, it's worthy of loosing stars? Ridiculous. And so what if Tom decides not to tread radically new ground? More power to him. I'd like to see any other artist who can be as dynamic as he!
6305718903|5.0|OK, I guess I love religious suspense type books and movies, but this one surpassed my expectations from the trailers to end up entertaining and captivating me.  The theme of the lost gospel were enthralling, and there are strongly opposed viewpoints on this issue in real-life, but the storyline was nonetheless strong and thought-provoking.  If the Catholic church has rejected the lost gospel, we can each form our own conclusions about why.  I personally believe they reject what does not support their strong beliefs to the point where they will find something to prove the lost gospel &quot;invalid&quot; or &quot;untrue&quot; so they can dismiss it.  So I enjoyed this plotline immensely.  The love and affection between Frankie and Father Kiernan was so moving.  It reminded me how loving Christ was and that his message to all of us was, Love.  ...Not celibacy, not hatred of other religions, not religious persecution, LOVE.  Cool movie.  A lot of things to think about.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|A parody of all those pseudo-scary movies, Scary Movie should be ranked as one of the funniest movies of all time! I couldn't stop laughing! Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.
B00003W8NM|3.0|&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a screen on which viewers project their own political and cultural obsessions. You'll find lots of reviewers here praising the film as a pointed attack on consumerism or a wake up call for disaffected youth. These themes certainly are there, but so is a bunch of other crappy culture criticism, notably whining about absent fathers and the feminization of modern men. The film simultaneously undercuts and celebrates its various messages. Are we really supposed to believe anything that comes out of Tyler Durden's mouth? If, in the end, the limitations and contradictions of the Fight Club movement are exposed, doesn't this pull the rug out from under its overall philosophy?<br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a wild ride, and for some viewers its technical virtuosity may have masked its logical, political and moral failures. &quot;Fight Club&quot; wants so badly to have a message. But it says far more about, say, the promise of digital editing than about contemporary culture.
0679879269|5.0|A few words to add to the chorus of praise for this wonderful book. I loved the Golden Compass but felt that the Subtle Knife dragged a bit. This third work brings them all together and is the best yet.<br />I am at that point of grieving when you've finished a fine book. I truly hated to see it end. And I came to love almost every character within - Lyra/Pan, Iorek and Serrafina most of all - that I'm dismayed I won't have another word to read about them.<br />The book is, as noted in other reviews, astonishingly anti-religious. All the folks worrying about Harry Potter should be paying more attention. But while it's a tirade against organized and dogmatic religion, the book is also very spiritual. The spirituality is much more Eastern in tone.
B000002INJ|5.0|Other bands play, Manowar kills!  This is in my opinion the best album by the kings of metal themselves.  The songs are either about metal, or Manowar themselves, frequently both.  I've tried to find another band that can compare to Manowar, but have not found one yet.<br />They are my favorite band.
B000002ADT|5.0|I gave this album to my future mother-in-law for Christmas (she lives a high-stressed life, thanks in part to me). She put it in her CD player and curled up on the couch. An hour later, I wandered in the room when the album had played through. She was so mellowed and deep in thought that she could only say &quot;could you press play again?&quot;<br />Later, fire crackling and drinks in hand, the whole family sat down for a chat and listened to it again. And again. And again. All I can say about this album is that it will really transfix you. It captures you, loses you in thought. This is what music should be - pleasant to your mind as well as your ears. I think that nearly anyone on earth could appreciate KIND OF BLUE in some capacity, and it doesn't get any better than having John Coltrane and Co. backing Miles up.
B00003CXE7|3.0|This is a good movie. Russel Crowe delivers a strong performance as a wronged general, slave and then of course, gladiator. His nemesis is young Commodus the emperor played desperately by Joachin Phoenix. The best elements of the movie are the splendid battles and the action filled contests of the colliseum. The digital effects are riveting if somewhat gory. A fine adventure, low on story and high on sword slash.

B00003CXHJ|5.0|U-571 is probably one of the greatest insights into submarine naval engagement from both sides of the fence. It has the adrenaline rush of Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide along with a history lesson you never knew. A highly believable cast and McConaughey does and outstanding job as the next captain in the making. Superb color and sound and some extras to help you realize the history lesson behind the film. A must have for your collection.

0670824399|5.0|I think Roald Dahl is the best children's author ever!  I'm 20, and I still read his books.  Matilda tells the story of a little girl genius.  Matilda taught herself to read from the newspapers lying around her house when she was a baby and she practically exhausts the local library's collection before she even begins school.  She is an extraordinary child, but she's not just smart.  She has a daring vengeful streak...  She gets excellent revenge on her father for horrid things he says to her.  Once, he even tears up her library book.  You really can't help but laugh and cheer for her when she gives the bad guys a dose of their own medicine!<br />Dahl's gift for inventing extraordinarily horrid characters is exercised beautifully in this story.  Matilda's father is a cheating used car dealer, and her mother regularly leaves 4-year-old Matilda home alone all afternoon so that she can play Bingo in the next town.  The Headmistress Trunchbull even throws a small girl across the playground by her pigtails!  Matilda's parents ignore her, the Headmistress is a holy terror, and Matilda's only comfort is her kind teacher, Miss Honey.  After the Headmistress, AKA the Trunchbull, does some particularly horrid things to the students and Miss Honey, Matilda uses her extraordinary brain to take back some of their own...<br />Like most of Dahl's books, there is an undeniable element of cruelty woven into this story-- but this is the best kind of cruelty!  When the good guys win, like they always do in Dahl's books, kids cheer on the fall of the real evil.<br />Matilda is my favorite Roald Dahl book, but The BFG and The Witches are close runners-up.  I highly recommend all of his books!
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|If you've seen the film, and come here looking for the soundtrack, then I think it's a fair guess to say that the film haunts you as it haunts me. The film was brilliant, but part of its power was the soundtrack's ambient sensory overflow, hitting you as the visuals stunned you, beating you down. For me the soundtrack is almost as painful as the film was - I can't listen to it without remembering Sara's descent, without linking each tear I shed in the theater with the symphony of sound composed by Clint Mansell, wrought from the strings of the Kronos Quartet.  <br />Should you buy the soundtrack? Yes. It's stunning, it's beautiful, and it will bring to the fulcrum of your being all the power that the film contained.
0440213525|3.0|I have just finished reading one of your brilliant novels, The Client. The plot of the novel was very interesting and engaging.  I really enjoyed the suspense and the thrill throughout the novel, but the story line could've been more realistic and more better.  <br />You have shown a great perspective of life.  By reading this novel, I realized that as we grow older we will deal with dangers and criticisms from others, at least once in our lives.  You have portrayed an important fact quite clearly and nicely.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.  However, the plot of the novel seemed very unrealistic.  For example, Mark is so young and helpless because he's 11 years old.  We do see many 11-year-old boys getting around by themselves.  It's pretty obvious that they are too young to get a lawyer.  I found it very annoying.  Also, The Client didn't have any twist to the story.  It was really straight foward and in your face.  I like a novel that has some mysterious and exciting climaxes or surprising.  This novel had neither surprises nor mysteriousness, which made it quite boring and tedious to read.  I was expecting more violence and anxiety to the story, but there weren't much of it.  In addition, the ending was very broad too.<br />In conclusion, I will give it another try andread on other novel of yours because I hear many people love reading your novels.  I may have offended you a little, but I'm just discussing about The Client and how it could've been written better.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I received this DVD for Christmas and loved it! Besides being an excellent film it is jammed with extras. The color and clarity of the film is phenomenal and the sound makes you believe that you are there. Some people have complained about the violence...get over it! What did you expect to see?! If you liked Braveheart and the Patriot you'll love this movie. Action packed and a story line you can follow. You'll be cheering for Crowe (or should I say &quot;The Spaniard&quot;) every step of the way. A must have for your collection.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of the best movies of 2000 and Crowe deserves some awards. Go and see this one.
068484267X|5.0|When I started reading this book, I was unsure whether I would finish it.  The young lives of Frank McCourt and his brothers and sister were so bleak.  McCourt's wonderful writing style pulled me through.  At every turn, the odds seemed to be against the remaining McCourt children (2 brothers and a sister died) ever seeing adulthood.  Despite the grinding poverty and despair of his family, McCourt somehow maintained his sense of humor in many parts of the book.
B000002UVX|5.0|I'm a blues fan and the only reason for that is because of Jimi Hendrix. It all started when I was sixteen and bought the Essential Jimi Hendrix Volume 1 because he was reputed to be the best guitar player ever. I hated it. My untrained ears couldn't understand what was coming out of my Walkman. In time, I aquired a taste for him and all of his influences. <br />I'm a big fan of Carey Bell, Hound Dog Taylor, and Stevie Ray Vaughan among others, but the Band of Gypsys album is the most energizing, and richly intense piece of music I know of collected on one album. It is my favorite CD and nothing else even comes close. (Well, Stevie comes close, but not too close). I would suggest that anyone give this album a chance. Give it a few listens if you have to &quot;aquire a taste.&quot; You may find a timeless album to add to your collection.
6305426651|5.0|If Hollywood had made this movie, it would have been a much poorer film, a clich&eacute; of rampaging Nazis and crying children. Roberto Benigni is flawless in his acting and direction here. The story told is one of beauty and hope amid misery and pain. For bumbling waiter Guido, every day is like a box of joy yet to be opened. He wins his girl with his irrepressible optimism and their family is complete with a little boy. But not happily ever after, because the Nazis have a different idea for Jewish people.<br />Guido's family must relocate to a concentration camp. Once there, he carries on an elaborate deception for his little boy, pretending the entire episode is a game they must win. Benigni does play on our emotions, but in a gentle way that never feels like manipulation. He lets us feel the characters' joy, fear, humor, and pain so subtly, you feel as if a story is being told to you, not watching a movie.<br />I had never before seen a foreign film, but I saw this one twice and bought the tape. You will laugh, you will cry, you will come away enriched.
B00004RFCM|2.0|My wife loves the show and that's why I bought this for her. Picture quality is terrible.  It's like watching an analog transfer of a very old movie tape.  Images are grainy.  You can actually see small black dots seeding the entire screen.  And believe me, this is not my TV, it's HBO!
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|I have to admit that this was a funny movie. It doesn't have a plot and you shouldn't expect one. It is basically making fun of the other scary movies this is why its called a spoof. Get it on dvd so you can see how they made it. Pretty good watch.
B00001ZULV|5.0|Virtually all the single hits plus a remake (with Peter gabriel) of &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot; in crisp, 3D sound. An excellent compilation and a rewarding listen.
B00003CX8J|4.0|I have heard of The X-Men comic books, but that is as far as it goes.  But that would not seem to matter here.  Actually, I would suggest that the X-MEN is directed at the un-initiated.<br />The setting is the near-future.  Humanity has started it's next stage of evolution and a small percentage are born with &quot;mutations&quot;.  These mutations empower the every day individual with some special ability.<br />There is divide in the general population as to how to respond to these &quot;mutants&quot; with some calling for registration and legal segregation and others calling for integration.  You would be correct in thinking that the thematic point of X-MEN serves as an allegory on racism.  Indeed, the opening sequence depicting the taking of Jews into a Nazi concentration camp delivers the theme effectively.<br />The &quot;hero&quot; of this flick is Wolverine(Hugh Jackman), a mutant who has a second metallic skeleton that allows him to shoot razor sharp talons out of his knuckles.  He is introduced to us through Roque(Anna Paquin), a teenage girl whose mutation causes her to take the life-force from another human at a single touch.  Rogue, running scared from her family and friends, teams up with Wolverine who is making a living as a traveling bare-knuckle fighter.  Together, they are rescued from Magneto(Ian McKellen) and his henchmen Mystique(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), Toad(Ray Parks), and Sabretooth(Tyler Mane) by the X-Men.<br />The X-Men are a team of mutants led by Prof. Charles Francis Xavier(Patrick Stewart).  His objective is to teach mutants to control and respect their powers while educating society on the value of mutants.  The overall aim here is for society to accept and integrate mutants.  His old friend and nemesis, Magneto, believes that in order for mutants to survive, they must fight society.  Xaviers team are: Cyclops(James Marsden) who can shoot fire from his eyes, Storm(Halle Berry) who can control the weather, and Dr. Jean Grey(Famke Janssen)who has telepatic powers.<br />The less experienced Sci-Fi moviegoer may find the detailed stories rather challenging.  The multiple stories and themes that run through this movie are complex yet compelling and - as is always the case with &quot;pack&quot; movies - the viewer is often left feeling that they would have liked to known more about each character.  <br />In terms of action, the fight sequences are expertly performed and are very reminiscent of The Phantom Menace's Jedi/Darth Maul fight scene.  Indeed Ray Parks (who played Darth Maul in Episode 1) is given plenty of opportunity to display those same skills again.  The special effects are somewhat muted and serve to enhance the movie rather than to overtake the plot.  I was particularly fond of a scene outside a railway station where Magneto (who can control metal) stops a bullet in front of a policemans forehead and threatens to let it go again.<br />Overall, the X-MEN is a very good movie packed with plenty of story and enough visuals to keep everyone happy.<br />Additionally, I am particularly fond of the the DVD box presentation.  The attractive packaging starts to draw you in before you even watch the movie.  A brownie point for Fox there.
0790734060|5.0|I first saw this movie in my Music Theory class in high school.  I didn't like it at first, but as it went by I LOVED it.  It is a movie that EVERY music major has seen, or even MUST see.  I own it on video, DVD and soundtrack in both formats.  Mozart was a pure genius and a gift from god.  Although the film is not completely accurate, it still is wonderful.
B00004RHZU|4.0|Know what I like about critics?? When they moan about disliking something it is pretty much guarenteed to be something worth checking out. And THAT is exactly what this cd is about. While Pink DOES follow the format set for today's music she brings SO much energy and passion into it. Songs like Stop Falling hold the old school torch quality of ladies past and will stand strong in that list and truly shows her singing capability. Pink is a lady of strength and confidence and her lyrics and voice echo that. Alot of new musical groups have ONE sound and each song mirrors the next. You won't find that on this one NOR will you find one or two you like and the rest ignored. THE ENTIRE CD is filled with great songs and it is quite an addictive CD and will quickly become a favorite in your cd list!
B000051VWW|4.0|I every one i have been a fan of sada quite some time. I FIND THIS CD VERY REFRESHING.                                         BOBBY R. BERMUDA
0195117298|4.0|For the general reader who is neither mathematician nor physicist, this book is a real stretch, but what a great stretch it is!  Barbour understands this and takes mostly successful pains to help us along.  And just as the body feels invigorated and stronger after a good workout, so does the mind on finishing Barbour's book.<br />The central thesis is that the role played by time in physicists' descriptions of the world,  has to go.  Its departure will open the way to unifying the hitherto unbridgeable gap between classical physics and quantum physics.  As Barbour explains with fascinating clarity, both are obviously correct and verified descriptions of how things work; they just don't mesh!  This, for physicists who believe deeply in the unity of nature, is cause for deep frustration.<br />Any book that sets out to address the big questions about `the ultimate arena of the universe' is not without ambition.  That is what led me forward through some tough going early on because, hey,  if this guy is really about to advance a description of how the universe works, I want to hear it!  Well, he delivers.  For Barbour, time, or rather the experience of change and movement, which require time to be real, is an illusion created by the existence of an infinity of possible simultaneously-existing and unchanging  `nows'.  These nows are configurations of the complete universe in a multi-dimensional configuration-space.  Quantum-probabilistic laws govern which nows are experienced, and all the laws of physics can be re-cast in terms of this version of how the universe works.<br />Put your reservations aside and consider the argument.  It's persuasive.  After all, our experience of history is only through records and memories, which of course are part of any now we experience.  After all, we don't truly look `into the past'.  We simply look at records and memories available to us at this instant, and in Barbour's thesis these indeed can reflect other nows, which are other places in the universe, but not other times.  The corollary of this is that nothing moves, nothing changes, in this model of the universe.  We don't travel from one now to the next and experience life like watching a movie made up of multiple still snapshots.  We just are.  The rest is illusion.<br />This last is where things don't quite work for this reader.  What we are seeing is a heroic attempt to reconcile the way this thesis works as a piece of theoretical physics, with a macro-description of the facts of existence and human experience.  Like other such attempts one encounters in this neighborhood of ideas, it hits the shoals of philosophy, not of science.  Here's what I mean: movement and change are facts of existence.  The role of science is to understand their nature, but it is not the role of science (nor philosophy) to deny that they exist.  That's out of bounds.  To put it another way: if you assert that movement and change as we experience them are illusory, what you have done is to redefine the meaning of the word `illusory' in a somewhat arbitrary way.  Again, out of bounds. And it may just be that Barbour's physics is right, just his attempt to bring it back to a correspondence with our daily realities that is flawed. <br />So give this one a shot and stretch your mind!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Anyone who gave this movie negative reviews must be either 50+ years old, or someone who enjoys their English class.  This movie is packed with so many hilariously funny jokes, you won't be able to catch your breath.  This movie is not offensive to me, nor should it be to anyone in or beyond high school.  I cannot wait for Scary Movie 2, I am confident it will be just as good.  My only problem - should have included nudity of both genders, or none at all.
B00004Z459|1.0|I first listened to their song that was on mtv and the radio all the time and at first thought it wasn't bad. Now lsitening to them a little more I thought, yay another band just like Korn.  These guys [are bad], don't buy their cd
B00003CXE6|5.0|Until I saw this film, I was beginning to seriously doubt the ability of Hollywood to produce engaging, powerful, epic films.  My faith is renewed.<br />In part, the film is a tremendous success because it conveys the notion of what it means to be a good person. Russell Crowe as general Maximus shows the viewer that a man (or woman) must act from integrity, and not from self interest.  In the film, Maximus has the opportunity to return to his beloved family, so long as he will endorse the depraved emperor Commodus.  Maximus does not act from self-interest, but rather from integrity by rejecting the murdeous emperor.  As a result, he loses everything, but not his dignity.<br />The film notes how words like 'honour' and 'trust' had lost meaning in the Roman Empire, and similarly poses the question of whether those words have today lost meaning for the viewer.<br />This film is a must see!  It is a classic already.
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|grudgingly i have to admit this movie had some moments i thought were funny, and the humor wasn't too forced.  unfortunately most all the humor was all based on vulgarities, although some was simply ridiculous, which came off a little better since it was not as overused of a tactic for providing laughs. the Wayans are more than a little hung up on homosexuality as a big joke here;  seems like someone is very uncomfortable with their own sexuality.
0385501005|5.0|My girlfriend gave me this book. I guess it wasn't the most subtle hint in the world! From the minute I picked it up I was totally enthralled. I was laughing, I was sniggering and surprisingly I found myself nodding my head in agreement with both Duffy and his girlfriend Mel. I can totally identify with Duffy's struggle as I'm sure most guys can. It's not like we're totally afraid of commitment - it's like Duffy says in the book we just have to come to terms with it. Gayle has a real talent for finding humour in the small things of life and it's this identification that makes this book such a winner from the word go. When I finished the book I gave it to my girlfriend, who cried at the end, then we talked about the book and we've decided to get married! Now, tell me how many books can do that! Fantastic!
B000002ADT|5.0|Probably the most listened to jazz album in my collection.  The viberant sounds of Miles Davis is accompianed by other greats such as John Coltrane and Bill Evans.  &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is Davis at his best. An easy listening, much more structured album than his &quot;Live at Filmore&quot; which is much more lose and open jazz.  This is a must have for all fans of Miles and people trying to extend their music horizons.
B000002KB8|5.0|i guess that this review is more general in that im talking abt black sabbath as a whole.the album kind of epitomises the appeal of the sabbath.......they are the perfect band, ozzy's chilling wail,iommi's titanic riffs and the superb rhythm section of ward and butler.screw led zep! they were nothing more than a bunch of pansies to begin with, this is simply the most powerful and intimidating music you'll ever have the priviledge to purchase and place in your heavy metal cd collection.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|i gave this 4 stars only because 1) 80 minutes is a bit short to cover the beatles hits (it's a bit jarring to open a cd w/ 'love me do' &amp; close it w/ 'long &amp; winding road' but i suppose that's the point, &amp; 2) the methods used to compile this makes it lean towards paul material (as do the 'anthology' series). HOWEVER! the great news is that this is the FIRST cd release of hits from their early career in their ORIGINAL MIXES! yes, not only was this mastered using Y2K technology so the sound wipes the floor w/ those 1987 masters we were all duped into buying, but gone as well are the 1987 remixes for cd that their catalog up to &amp; including 'rubber soul' was subjected to. for the 1st time in over a decade you can hear 'help!', for example, the way it was released in 1965. the beautiful avedon photos are tossed in as a bonus. now if we can just get them to put out the mono mixes (especially the superior mono 'sgt. pepper'). maybe for next x-mas?
B000050XEI|5.0|If you have ever liked any Enya song, you will like this entire CD.  I couldn't be more pleased.
B00000J7JO|3.0|As an old Chili Pepper fan, i found this album to be alright; not exceptional, but not bad.  Californication is lacking from the original Chili Pepper funk that they did so well in &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik.&quot;  If you like Californication the song, then you will most likely love the album, but if you are in search for more of what brought America to love the Chili Peppers, you may be disappointed that you spent nearly 20 dollars.
B00003A9QL|4.0|THIS IS THE FINEST LIVE PERFORMANCE FROM METALLCA TO ME. I'M NOT A HEADBANGER IN REAL SENSE BUT THESE CD'S HAS SOMETHING SPECIAL WHICH GRABED MY ATTENTION. THE ALBUMS CONSISTS OF SOME OF THE FINEST WORK OF METALLICA, FROM THE TRADITIONAL WILD THRASH OF THE BAND TO THE CLASSICAL OPERA TOUCHED SLOW METAL. NONE OTHER THRASH BAND EXCEPT METALLICA, HAS SO BEAUTIFUL OPENNING OF THE SONGS WHICH MAY KEEP YOU HELD YOUR BREATH. SONGS LIKE &quot;WHEREVER I MAY ROAM&quot; &quot;SAD BUT TRUE&quot; &quot;OF WOLF AND MAN&quot; AND &quot;FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL&quot; REFLECTS THE PURE ENERGETIC POWERFUL THOUGHTS OF THE BAND WITH JASON PROVING HIMSELF AS AN INCREDIBLE VOCALIST. WHILE THE CLASSICAL SYMPHONIES OF &quot;NOTHING ELSE MATTERS&quot; ECSTASY OF GOLD&quot; AND &quot;ONE&quot; LEAVE YOU ASTONISHED AND MAKE THIS ALBUM A TREAT TO LISTEN.  SO WHY BELEIVE ON MY WORDS. JUST GO AND CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF, AND YOU WILL KNOW WHY METALLICA IS THE BEST HEAVY/THRASH METAL BAND OF THE WORLD.
B00004X01U|5.0|Can it be possible for an artist to stay in the spotlight for two decades? Is it possible for an artist to grow beyond her critic's expecations, so that one day they too will be bowing at this artist's achievments? Is it possible for an artist to grow more beautiful after 40 and be more relevant today than she was 20 years ago? Yes, it is but only if you are Madonna.<BR> <br />With Music, Madonna forges ahead into another album full of dance and electronic beats. Instead of the sterile environment that many other dance artists fall into, Madonna's album, Music, warms the listener on the first spin. With only a few sparse ballads (the haunting, &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; and the serenely beautiful ode to woman-hood &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;), Music will make you want to get up and dance for the most intense hour of dance music that 2000 had to offer.<br />The album spent 3 weeks at #1 in the U.S. alone, making it Madonna's first #1 album since 1989's, Like a Prayer. The title track and first single, spent 4 weeks at the top of the U.S. Pop Charts and another 6 on the dance charts. With all of these accomplishments for 2000 alone, it would be safe to assume that Madonna will be sitting at the top of the MUSIC charts for a long time to come, solidfying her as the un-challenged Queen of Pop.
B00003CXE7|4.0|The plot won't win an award, but the sets, props, effects, action, and acting certainly might.  This is your basic Roman political intrigue movie using modern filming practices and it looks impressive.  The battles and fights are wonderfully done.  Casting seems right on the money too, with maybe one exception (I'll leave that up to you :-)  It's graphically violent and not suitable for children but adults should enjoy it.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is soooo amazing. I got for under ten dollers at my local music store and I can't get it out of my cd player.<br />1)Papercut-10/10- At first it was my favorite untill I listen to the whole cd. It's so cool with the lyrics and the riffs and the dj in the back.<br />2)One step closer-10/10-I still like this song but I uselly skip through it because I hear it on the radio all the time. &quot;Shut up when I'm talkin' to you!&quot; :)<br />3)With you-10/10- I love how they blend Cheaster Bennington's vocals with Mike Shinado's and then the riffs are amazing.<br />4)Points of authority-10/10- A very catchy chorus and once again Brad Delson has amazing riffs in it. A very cool song.<br />5)crawling-10/10- At first I would skip through it but then I started listening to it and I found it was really cool. It starts out like I don't know sort of a rap-rock balled but it has cheaster screaming it at some piont.<br />6)Runaway-10/10- A deep song about him wanting to runaway. and how everyone blames him for everything but still a good song.<br />7)By myself-10/10- It starts out really fast but it slows down when cheaster sings. But when he says by myself mike shinado steps up to but it back into the *Linkin Park Mood* and starts screaming Myself I ask why, but in my mind I can't rely... awesome song.<br />8)In the end-10/10- This is a little diffrent it starts out with piano in the beginning and ends with piano. It has a very catchy chorus and you would thing you have heard it somewhere else.<br />9)Place for my head-10/10-tied for my #2 favorite song with #11. It starts with Brad playing and then Joe Hahn and rob Bourdon *drummer* join him it really cool kinda dancable I would say. I love the chorus.<br />10)Forgotten-11/10- The best song on here and my favorite it starts right after #9 stops with &quot;From the top to the bottom....&quot; It is so awesome and the instruments blend togather in a way the leave you hanging 4 more and the lyrics are so cool.It gets stuck in my head all day. This Diffently has to be there next single. <br />11)cure for the itch-10/10-Like I said before it is tied for 2nd favorite with 9. but it doesn't have anyone talkin in at after the first part it's just Dj Joe hahn doing some stuff but it is really awesome I could diffently see this in a club and everyone dancing to it.<br />12)Push me away-10/10-A great song with a cool chorus. The chorus gets stuck in your head. It's on some sound track I forget which one.<br />This is a MUST have cd all the songs on here are awesome! I always listen to it straight through I can't get enough of the cd. personally its too short. These guys have amazing talent. And I couldn't see them going away any time soon.
B000050XEI|4.0|Enya has always had a great voice-Diva class I think.  &quot;Wild Child&quot; is my favorite it makes even though it makes no sense-it's something new.  Pilgrim is a bit overworked, it over emphasizes the split road theme (again).   I hate &quot;Only Time&quot; it sounds just like &quot;China Roses&quot;   All are very beautiful and give my woofer a good workout, but this album seems to have a bit of &quot;hey the boss said don't make your stuff so creepy and wierd because we want a wider audience.&quot; so I think that's were some of the intense emotion that was evident in previous albums has gone.  But this as with the other albums takes a few repeat listenings before it grows on you.
B00004TRD8|5.0|I can't wait for True Lies 2 because Cameron has twice shown himself to be a master of action sequels, first Aliens and then T2.<br />I found myself almost cackling with maniacal glee as stepped through the almost endless selection of options.  This even surpasses The Abyss as the best DVD package I've seen.<br />I'll agree that the &quot;extra-special easter-egg&quot; edition isn't really something to write home about, since the ending 2029 coda was left off for very good reasons.  I do take issue with the earlier reviewer who said that this suggested Cameron needed to be &quot;reined in.&quot;  Cameron himself cut those scenes, just as he was the one who cut both Aliens and The Abyss for length.  Cameron knows the marketplace as well as anyone, but he also knows how to package these director cuts better than anyone.
B000051VWW|4.0|I guess she revels in the power of paining fans with very long waits in between albums.  Her last offering before this new selection is her greatest hits collection.  All fingers point toward an end of a career or change of record label once that happens.  Fortunately it was neither.<br />It is worth the wait.  A definite must have if you ever loved her music.<br />By your side is just the sweetest song, too bad she hasn't released the Ben Watt remixes.  <br />Being a Fan I guess I am biased.  But then again, Who doesn't love a little pleasure after the pain.  Love the album! <br />Its still Sade only with a different edge, a rather RnB edge on certain songs where she sounds a bit hiphoppish.  I am not into hip-hop but she's way hip it gets me hoppin'.  Aside from that it is a great recording
B00003CX6P|5.0|Matt Damon plays his role to perfection. While my wife who is a big Damon fan did not like his role in this movie, that only reaffirmed what I already knew, he nailed the role. This movie is a deep, disturbing picture which will leave you with an uneasy feeling in your stomach when you leave. The DVD doesn't have that many extra features which are better than the VHS, just a French version which isn't appealing to those of us who don't speak French. I would rate this as a must buy for a DVD collection as it was the second to make it into mine after American Beauty.

B000022TT4|4.0|Rattle and Hum presents U2 at a moment of time when they were still a band possessed with the innocent romanticism of The Joshua Tree but beginning to teeter over into pretention and self-importance.  Fortunately, the band was intelligent and self-aware enough to avoid falling completely into those traps.  As a concert movie, this movie is one of the best I've ever seen.  The off-stage stuff can be a little uneven.<br />To answer the previous reviewer who wondered about the &quot;extra 11 tracks:&quot;  They are simply referring to the fact that there are 11 songs in the film that do not appear on the soundtrack album (and several songs on the CD that aren't in the movie).
B000001FS3|5.0|Most U2 fans would agree that 'The Joshua Tree' (1987) is their finest moment of the 1980s.  While again with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, this record represented a departure from the musical experiment of 'The Unforgettable Fire' (1984) (much of which sounds dated now) and began a foray into traditional American music that culminated in 'Rattle & Hum' (1988).  Here's a song-by-song:<br />1. \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\".  As one of the ultimate show-openers and perhaps their most popular rock song, if you haven't heard it, you must live under a rock.<br />2. \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\".  A gospel song (which is more evident on the version included in 'Rattle & Hum' (1988)) and one of their #1 hits, if you haven't heard it, you must live under a rock.<br />3. \\"With Or Without You\\".  The first single from the record and arguably one of the best musical and lyrical moments for U2 (the latter being characteristically open to multiple interpretations), if you haven't heard it, . . .<br />4. \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\".  A hard rock song in the musical tradition of Led Zeppelin, U2 delivers one of the two overtly political songs on the record - this one aimed at U.S.  With constant changes to the musical theme and lyrical context of this tune over its appearances on every U2 tour since 1987, it is interesting to go back to the minimalistic original.<br />5. \\"Running to Stand Still\\".  With the beautiful opening on the slide guitar, this ballad sequel to \\"Bad\\" is the first distinct sign that American music was a definite influence.<br />6. \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\".  This is just a simple, solid \\"folk\\" song that benefits nicely from orchestral additions at the end.<br />7. \\"In God's Country\\".  This oft-forgotten fourth single from the record, an ode to America, is certainly catchy and is everything you expect from Bono lyrically.<br />8. \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\".  With harmonica stylings, no where is the American influence more evident than on this prequel to the studio cuts to come on 'Rattle & Hum'.  That said, if there is a weak song on this record, this is it.<br />9. \\"One Tree Hill\\".  A song with a story, it has a distinct energy that builds and is probably the one track that sounds most like the previous record, 'The Unforgettable Fire'.<br />10. \\"Exit\\".  A real brooding quiet/loud rocker, this tune has an atmosphere that has never been duplicated.  The chirping crickets in my headphones still send shivers up my spine.<br />11. \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\".  Similar in approach to \\"One Tree Hill\\", this song is a political ode to mothers who had lost their sons, anonymously, to the Pinocet regime.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie was the first one I bought on DVD. I never got a chance to see it on the big screen and I have been kicking myself ever since.   The DVD delivers crisp sound and picture quality that VHS cannot duplicate. The red coloration on DVD comes out the way Mendes intended it to. Also, listening to Mendes commentary of the movie was very insightful. If you enjoy deep, thought provoking movies that make you stop and think about the way things appear, then this is an excellent movie for you. If you take movies for surface value and don't read deeper, then avoid this movie, cause you won't understand it.
068817776X|4.0|While this story of survival in Nazi Germany is indeed, fascinating, as readers have attested, it leaves many questions unanswered.  Why did the author pursue a law degree long after the Nazis had come to power and it was apparent that Jewish lawyers had a limited future, to say the least, in Germany?  Why did the author remain in the country when she could have escaped, loyal to a selfish lover who refused to shelter her in her hour of greatest need?  It is clear why she became involved with and married a Nazi officer, less clear why she chose to bear his child.  The author's moral authority is weakened by her taking in, then abandoning, an orphan.  She seems to have hardened her heart to compassion in the interests of saving herself and her own daughter.  One moral can be drawn:  When the chips are down, practical skills can save your life.  The author, a trained lawyer, worked as a nurse's aide during the war and as a seamstress later.  Her German law degree proved as useless to her as her worthless first lover.
B00000JXVK|5.0|On Any Sunday is, simply put, one of the best sports documentaries ever produced.  It was one of the first movies I saw as I kid, and since then I have watched it whenver I can. Affectionate and witty, OAS gives a clear overview of the sport of motorcycle racing, showing the both its beauty and its brutality.  We see motocross, speedway, dirt bikes, desert racing, superbikes, ice racing, hill climbing and trials riding, plus a few things I probably forgot.<br />Of course, the film was shot about 30 years ago (it can't be that long!) so it only shows the sport as it existed in 1970 or so, but as snapshot of a time and a group of people, it is nothing less than brilliant.<br />When I saw it was out on DVD I pounced immediately.  The only quibbles I have are with the opening titles (cheesy 80's-vintage video) and the sound.  The narrator's voice only comes out of the left speaker.  Still, considering that this was not produced in dolby surround sound, it's a very minor complaint.
0399146253|1.0|Reading this book was as painful as a trip to the dentist.  By the time I had managed to work my way through the first 100 pages, I had come to the conclusion that for all concerned it would of been less painful if Chandonne had killed Scarpetta and ended this series that has gone downhill so fast.  That being said, I probably will buy the next book just hoping that Patricia Cornwell can find the magic she had in earlier books in this series.
0061020710|4.0|Originally published in 1983, &quot;The Color of Magic&quot; begins one of the most popular (the author's books account for a little over 1% of all book sales in Great Britain!), prolific and unique series to be found in any genre.  While it has its precedents, perhaps, in the short stories of Fritz Leiber (in the opening to this book Pratchett pays homage to Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser with his characters Bravd and the Weasel), and Pratchett's style of humor has been admirably imitated in works such as Steven Brust's tales of Vlad Taltos, Pratchett remains the master of fantastic satire, punning and poking fun at fantasy as well as the society that has spawned it.  Had the cast of Monty Python chosen to write fiction, it is likely work such as this would have sprung from their endeavors.  And I suspect there are many who read Pratchett that touch no other fantasy.<br />While replete with the delightful and bumbling cast of characters and imaginative, often perverse circumstances that typify and enrich Pratchett's later work, this novel nonetheless lacks the focus of much of the author's best stories, essentially a rather rambling and loosely constructed saga comprising four separate tales, patched together by the shared setting of Discworld and the characters of Rincewind, Twoflowers and the inimitable Luggage.  Because of this, despite its uproarious moments of humor, it is not entirely successful.  However, it is our introduction to Discworld and The Great A'tuin, Unseen University and the precincts and denizens of Ankh-Morpork, with its guilds of assassins and thieves, and so many other settings and characters that are so memorably evolved in the later books that one would be bereft were one not to begin the Discworld series here.  Even with the loose composition and shifting, often abrupt turn of events, the rich humor and satiric moments that enliven and punctuate all of Pratchett's prose are in ample evidence here, foreshadowing the gems that are to follow.  And, compared to the vast waste of ordinary, commonplace fantasy published each year, any work by Pratchett is certain to shine out like a star lighting the night.<br />Don't fail to read this: you're in for some real fun!
0441172717|5.0|This book has got to be the absolute best science fiction book of all time!  When reading this masterpiece, I was lost in time and reality. I felt emotional yet it was subtle.  All characters were intricately detailed and believable.  I am reading the 4th book as we speak and will attempt to continue on with Brian Herbert's sequels.  Although no one could mimic Frank Herbert's style!
0399146253|4.0|Hip-Hip-Hooray!  Patricia Cornwell is definitely back up to snuff with her latest, The Last Precinct.  From beginning to end I was totally engrossed.  Wrapping up some unfinished business with finality and opening up new horizons for Kay Scarpetta made this an especially tantalizing treat.  I look forward to what now lies in store for Kay, her niece, Lucy, and yes - even Marino.  Will he retire???  Is Lucy involved with her former boss, Teun???  Stay tuned...only Patricia Cornwell knows.
B00000IUT7|1.0|Unless your Brio set has no hills, you should expect this engine to have trouble.  First, on one of the older bridges, the train was too tall, so we had to remove.  Next, like other reviewers I just read, this engine has no power.  With brand new batteries, and fresh out of the box, it made it up only one hill (one time) without some kind of trouble.  This was without any trains attached!<br />If you're going to have hills w/ a Brio set, you should not use a battery operated engine!
B00004YA66|2.0|Excellent idea, bad execution. We all know that time travel in this day and age is not possible so Frequency takes an uncommon event to try and explain how it has suddenly became possible. But what was needed is an explanation as to why different time periods could essentially be happening at the same time (for a better and more entertaining look at this concept, read Michael Crighton's Timeline), and there is a good explanation that could be covered in a few minutes. While the movie was based on a good idea, and it had some exciting moments, the script left something to be desired. The picture perfect ending is what completely ruined the movie for me (just like the ending to the Waterboy). Michael Eisner had to be involved. There were some good scenes, especially when Quaid finds a way to escape the fire and when James Caviesel escapes from the Police Interrogation room, but other than that the movie goes on with unexplained events and unestablished relationships between characters (what ever happened to his live-in girlfiend?). I watched it and had an idea that it might be good, instead, I was treated to a Disney ending, which definitely was the wrong choice for an original movie.
B00003CXA6|5.0|There aren't nearly as many films devoted to the American Civil War as there should be.  Gettysburg, the best of the bunch, is just amazing.  That's all, amazing.  I can't think of any other word more suitable.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|U-571 was a good movie, average at best. The screenplay was outstanding, if you think about the concept; a bunch of men stuck in a submarine for a long period of time trying to save their own necks. It doesn't make for exciting cinema, but they pulled it off somehow. There were solid performances throughout the movie, although some casting could have been done better, and the movie kept you on your toes. There were 3 things wrong with the movie, inaccuracy, no higher sense of purpose, and Bill Paxton's character.  The inaccuracy may have been what kept the movie alive, and definitely it helps create a great DVD, but all of those depth charges (the source of the explosions) at such close range just suspends any kind of belief in the movie. Then of course there is the race to the bottom of the ocean and the destruction of the battle ship (to borrow a line from Dr. Evil &quot;right&quot;). The other problem is that there is no sense of higher purpose portrayed by the characters which might have given the movie more emotion. Sure the higher purpose was interlaced with the plot, but there was no mention or thought about the importance of their mission. Lastly, and I think more importantly, is the casting of Bill Paxton as the advice-giving father figure. It just doesn't work. It would have been more effective had he repeated an earlier performance; his role in Aliens. The movie needed a memorable smartalick, a role that Paxton plays better than anyone else. The movie can be watched once, but other than that it would just be a waste of 2 hours of your life.
B00000DCHE|5.0|This is an atypical live cd not a greatest hits...maybe a greatest hits that never were. Billy Joel wrote some wonderful songs before his breakthrough &quot;The Stranger&quot; and &quot;Songs in the Attic&quot; is a collection of those. While his songs were solid they get a better showcase here, with a more mature and confident Joel at the helm. The material here is his strongest, even better than his trio of pop classics in the late 70s/early 80s. Best here: &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, &quot;You're My Home&quot; and &quot;I've Loved These Days&quot; but that's leaving out alot of good stuff.
0790729652|4.0|Jack Nicholson delivers a great performance (as always), Michael Keaton (sorry Adam West) plays his best role since Mr. Mom (although too monotone), and we can all agree that Alec Baldwin may be one of the luckiest men alive with Kim Bassinger as his wife. By far the best of the Batman series, Tim Burton does a terrific job of keeping the movie dark and the violence to a minimum for the PG-13 rating. Sometimes slow, and never able to live up to its hype, the comic is more than justified by a movie that is just under two hours long. There are two flaws, no Robin and the Joker dies in the end. How much better could later films have been if Batman had a partner that could have easily brought humor to the film and added some more plot twists to help the movie move. As far as the Joker dying, when did that ever happen in the comics? For the movie it works, but Warner Brothers never looked past the hype of this movie and took it in the wallet with the rest of the subpar series. Overall the movie is entertaining and the sharpness of the picture of the DVD make it even more of a can't pass up movie.
0780627024|1.0|This is one infuriating movie.  A pleasant premise (and the goodwill of an unsuspecting movie audience) is turned on its head and exploited for what turns out to be the filmmaker's banal political opinions.  Nothing in the second half of this movie is supported by the tone of the first half.  I had a days-long disagreement with a friend about this movie in which I came up with a long list of inconsistencies and absurdities.  I invite you to start your own list.<br />But I will say this:  It's a beautiful movie to watch (the transformations from black and white are gorgeous, and there's no denying the visceral power of the very first image of spot color), and Joan Allen, as always, rises above everything she's given.  That's what makes it all the more frustrating.  What a waste.
B000002LQR|5.0|From the moment I heard Fruscainte's guitar on the opening track...to the final few words on &quot;They're Red Hot&quot;...I didn't move a muscle. It is one of the single greatest rock/funk/somewhat rap albums I have ever heard. To go from a party-heavy track like &quot;Give It Away&quot; to a smooth, touching ballad like &quot;Under The Bridge&quot;, is a rarity in today's recordings. <br />Stand-out tracks-Breaking The Girl, Suck My Kiss, I Could Have Lied, The Righteous &amp; The Wicked, Give It Away, (the best track on the album) Under The Bridge, and Sir Psycho Sexy. <br />But don't let that list fool you. The entire is pure listening enjoyment, no matter what style of music you prefer. <br />I highly reccomend this to anyone who likes just good 'ol American music.
1565846117|5.0|it's so engrossing and so good that it read like a movie that would couldn't wait to see the ending. it spooked me like a good book would do and this sort of mystery applied to me. it had some Swedish names and places to contend with - but besides that it was fast paced and involved. really enjoyed it.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Excellent cd, great in concert.  Can't wait to hear more from her--she is going to be a huge artist.
B000002HRE|3.0|I loved Metallica, but this can't possibly be the best. I remember when I lived in Houston and I hated Metallica at this time. The Black Album and the self-titled were much better. When i was only about 7 i actually liked Metallica. But the tracks are a bit dull. I like the 3 singles Fuel, The Memory Remains, and Unforgiven II. The only other good song is Better Than You, all the others sound exactally the same and bore me. It could have been much better. Buy any other album before this unless you're a hardcore fan.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|I found this movie to be rather disturbing in its portrait of people in general.  The careless actions of the actors in this movie are some of the contributing factors to the labels that not only African Americans are trying to break free from, but teenagers in general suffer from these sterotypes also.  It is a shame when a movie as sensless as this one was is at the top of society's list of favorites. If this is what people find entertaining then we need to stop complaining the problems in America because we are our own worst enemy!
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is about as good as A Perfect Circle's &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; with the greatness in quality of the music. It has 2 previously unlreleased tracks, the single No Leaf Clover and Human. I first saw this on VH1 on Fanclub. Well, Nothing Else Matters didn't really need an orchestra is what I thought, because the original already did have one. Some of their heavy metal tunes were hard to think of as having an orchestra in 'em but actually felt great listening to. It's got 21 tracks, including 4 from ReLoad. It has Fuel, (my fave from the album)The Memory Remains, and Devil's Dance i didn't really care too much for. There was only 2 from Ride the Lightning and Kill 'Em All, and it also included the classic &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. Actually, the self-titled is my personal fave from Metallica, and it has Nothing Else Matters, Enter Sandman, Until it Sleeps, and more. it was hard to get very many from ...And Justice For All as it may've seemed little, but was a good choice from the 9-track album. It's one of the first times an album has put a metal album with any symphony, as this did, San Fransisco Symphony. It is a must for any Metallica fan.
0679879269|3.0|I loved this book. From the very beginning I couldn't put it down, and I read the entire 518 pages in three days. The whole time I was reading it I was planning on writing a fabulous Amazon.com review praising every aspect of this book. I loved every single character and every single event and I kept thinking how I wished I was Lyra. My conversations were limited to &quot;Lyra is so cool, isn't she?&quot; and I spent every second of my free time reading it. Then there was the ending...<br /> I absolutely HATED the ending. I think it was the worst ending I could have come up with. Did Philip Pullman write this knowing that people like me who become obsessed with characters, would hate it? I cried for hours, and I couldn't think about anything else. For such a great book, it was a pretty lousy ending. I had to give this book at least three stars, because I loved it so much, and if it had a different ending I would have definitely given it five. I also hate the fact that this was the last book in this series that I loved so much. Now, if there was a sequel...
B00004RFCM|5.0|everything has already been said about this extremely funny and realistic quatuor of single girls - it feels like the writers just spend their days with MY girlfriends - or else, where would they learn to be so true?<br />One thing though: when is season 2 finally coming out?
B00004XOWM|4.0|What is it with rock fans? If the message isnt all about slitting wrists an artist is stamped with the 'rubbish' label. I like all kinds of music, mostly rap and House, but then I heard a few Limp Bizkit tracks. I decided to buy the album and I felt that it was worth my $15 for the songs it included. 'Take a look around' and 'Rollin' I feel are very good songs and are a breath of fresh air from the usual dark message of rock. I am willing to accept that because I am not into rock music much many people may disagree with my review, but to anyone like me who enjoys more than one type of music, I would strongly suggest buying this CD to add to your music collection.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Sure, this is a nice CD, since all the Beatles did was great. BUT I have to say that the best songs are not on this album. Songs that changed music such as Strawberry Fields Forever, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and great songs such as Hapiness Is A Warm Gun, Across The Universe, Because and Tomorrow never knows are not on this CD. They were not number one hits, but I really find the last part of the existence of this band far more interesting than than the early days. So maybe a second CD should come ?
B00003CXE7|5.0|I have personally never been as captivated with a movie in my life.  I heard about people watching it several times and just couldn't believe it. But then I saw it, went out and bought a DVD player and now have seen it at least eight times.   Why do accomplished  people in the present want to watch this again and again? Besides the fact that the movie is wonderful on many levels (acting, costumes, action, music(too evocative for words) sets, etc)and is layered thick with details missed on first and second viewing, there must be more.  I think it could be a search for transcendence in a secular world where nothing is really worth dying for, especially not your self respect or honor.  I know at least one judge who has seen it 20 times!  Anyway, this is a must buy and a must see---again and again.  Betcha can't watch just once...
B00000JGEF|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger has one of his best roles as Dutch, the leader of an elite rescue force which is called upon to rescue a cabinet minister of a friendly Latin American government who has fallen into rebel hands.  Coming along for the ride is Dillon, played by Carl Weathers, who used to work with Dutch in years past but now is a CIA agent.  What Dutch does not realize is that the story he has been fed by Dillon is baloney.<br />Predator plays like two movies in one.  The first third of the film focuses on Dutch's team trying to rescue the &quot;cabinet minister&quot; held in an armed camp deep in the Central American jungle.  The movie then changes gears when the Predator starts hunting Dutch's team.<br />What helps make Predator better than other films of this genre is a really good cast that complements Schwarzenegger, including Jesse Ventura as the tobacco chewing Blaine, Bill Duke as Mac (notice how he is always shaving himself even though he does not have any facial hair!), Sonny Landham as Billy, the Indian Tracker, and the beautiful Elpidia Carillo as Anna. Each character has a well defined personality that makes each one stand out.  <br />The Predator is &quot;one ugly....&quot; as Dutch calls him, and it can best be described as tall creature with a crab-like face and rasta dreadlocks.  <br />There are some minor plot flaws, for example, why did the Predator wipe out Jim Hopper's team before it could attack the rebel camp, but then waits until after Dutch's team has wiped out the camp before he hunts them?  I also thought the scene when they were all firing into the jungle to be a bit excessive, but Predator is still a classic for me.
B00003CXE7|5.0|A film of epic proportion matched by digital technology that leaves the watcher ensconced in a world where to maim and kill is to succeed and survive. Russell Crowe exudes strength, and intelligence, with a winning ability to lead men as empires fall at his feet.<br />Maximus (Crowe), a general in the Roman army, has been slated by the reigning Emperor to lead Rome and return it to the people, removing it from the hands of the senate, which has ruled with duplicity. He finds himself betrayed by a pathetic, power hungry man. No longer a favored soldier, he is sold into slavery, where as a gladiator, his need for revenge grows strong, keeping him alive as he wins over the crowds in the gladiator's arena.<br />The schemes and intrigue that takes place in the darkness of the night, along with the subtle threats that initiate the treachery among family members keeps you craving that justice which is robustly delivered by director Ridley Scott. The final showdown takes our hero to the infamous coliseum, where he faces an array of weapons and opponents. What a satisfying pleasure it will be to witness justice at its finest hour.<br />This Academy Award nominated film is certainly a 5 star production and a movie that will stand the test of time. The surround-sound alone leaves you feeling like part of the crowd as they stomp and cheer for the Gladiators. Other movies of interest directed by Ridley Scott include Blade Runner and Alien. 1/2/01
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade remains sensual, pure, and above all else feminine. Missed you and your music baby.
B00004XQ83|5.0|An excellent sampling of traditional southern music.  This is a great introduction for those who aren't familiar with the music of Allison Kraus, Emmylou Harris and Gillian Welch.  Krauss' vocals on &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; are stunning.  It is also a must own for fans of the genre for gems like the Alan Lomax recording of a chain gang singing Po Lazarus and Ralph Stanley's chilling acappella &quot;O Death&quot;  It is not necessary to have seen the film to appreciate the soundtrack, although it is a good companion to it.
B00003CXFG|3.0|Nobody's Oscar pick, but pretty OK.  Vin Deisel is pretty good, and Mitchell looks great.  Plot is full of holes, but it's a pretty good time if you aren't asking too much of it.
B000050XEI|5.0|I've been listening to Enya for years and it just keeps getting better!  Since The Celts way back when...she just keeps cranking out quality music.  The tunes are haunting, as usual.  The lyrics are thoughtful and thought-provoking, also as usual.  Every song is deeply layered with soft, sweet, mind-bending harmonies.  It's not a terribly long CD, but the length doesn't stand out as a bad thing.  What's there is wonderful.
006109594X|5.0|I don't know what all you nay-sayers are talking about. This is a great book, errors or not. If all you can concentrate on is the errors, maybe you should try writing a book like this some time. It is a really good book, with an interesting plot. And, though it is not likely that the plot could occur, the characters are interesting and the story is fun to read. So, for all you that don't like it, grow up and stop whining. If you don't like it, don't read it.
B000055ZB8|4.0|I recently purchased a newly restored and remastered version of the original silent version of &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. Although it is not absoutely perfect, it comes pretty close. The print that was used was pretty clear and I found it not quite as dark as the previous version on laser disc was. I also like the intertitles  and the original tints. If you wish to listen to a new 5.0 audio track there is a new score that really adds some additional chills. And last but definately not least there are some additional supplementary extras that add some more history to the making of the film {although I would have liked to have had more information on the actor who portrayed Nosferatu-Max Shreck}! I thoroughly enjoy watching this film and never tire of it. I recommend this film wholeheartedly.

B00004Z4WQ|1.0|My one star rating is for the flawed DVD disc--not the movie.  &quot;Scary Movie&quot; is rather crude and vulgar at times, but you can't help but laugh along with it.<br />I--along with many others--seem to be having the same problems with the DVD.  If you play it through a DVD-rom drive, it usually gets hung up on the FBI warning--then it either crashes the DVD player program or the whole computer itself.  I've tried to play it with and without using the PCFriendly program--neither works.  I'm not sure how well it plays on regular DVD players.<br />I've visited PCFriendly's site and looked for support.  They do acknowledge that there have been problems with the DVD getting stuck on the FBI warning, but they insist that it is only a small number of players and not the DVD itself.<br />I have many, many DVDs and have never experienced a problem with any of the titles--except for &quot;Scary Movie.&quot;  I think they just don't want to acknowledge there's a problem and have to risk recalling a bunch of DVDs.<br />Other than all those problems, the film itself is pretty funny.  If anyone has found a solution to these problems, please let us know.
B000002WNP|5.0|Of any CD I own (and I own a ton of CDs), I listen to any of the five discs that make up this CD collection the most. If you're considering getting an Elvis collection that includes music from the 60s, you're short changing yourself if you pass this collection up for a single disc comp. There are too many Great songs in this boxed set to pass up. Along with absolutely incredible songs, you'll find that this box guides you through the maturation of Elvis. It's really remarkable listening to the set slowly move from the cute songs of the early 60s to the more mature songs with his changing, mature voice that started taking over in the later 60s. Starting around the second quarter of Disc 3 (and the incredibly beautiful &quot;Tomorrow is a Long Time&quot;, you really see the change in Elvis starting to take effect. By Disc 5, you're hearing Elvis sing &quot;Kentucky Rain&quot;...a far cry from &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; on the first disc. Only two movies are (slightly) represented in this movie: Tickle Me, which is his only movie that contains songs that aren't centered around the plot of the movie, and Clambake...one of his last movies, and songs from this movie appear near the end of Disc 3.<br />Listening to this collection is really like listening to 5 different shades of Elvis....all of them spectacular in their own way. Listening to this collection is like listening to Elvis grow up through his music.<br />Too many excellent songs in this collection to name. Before I bought this collection, I probably knew about 30 of the songs that made up this 5 disc set. Now that I've been listening to this collection for several years, there are very few songs that I don't absolutely love, and I can honestly say that Elvis' best songs have never received radio airplay.<br />If you know Elvis only by single CD collections and by what you've heard on the radio, then this boxed set, a perfect collection of Elvis music, will take you to a whole new Elvis world.  Get it and enjoy some of the greatest music you never knew existed.ome of the greatest music you never knew existed.
B00003CXDG|5.0|It sure has good stunts. The story line is good though it does not have many twists. Overall it leaves a good impression.
B000002UWF|5.0|Louis Prima was at his peak just before I was born, so he's crept into my life only recently. I, too, saw BIG NIGHT and was familiar with the name, but the music came after that.  My father-in-law, an Italian-American is a big fan. Then, we bought Disney's JUNGLE BOOK movie for our three year old, and heard Prima as &quot; himself&quot; in the King Louis character. My parents loved the movie as much as our son, and started talking about Louis Prima. So I bought the CD and it's now our current favorite. We took the CD when we visited our families at Christmas and everyone enjoyed it (when we arrived at the in-law's house, my son mentioned something to his grandpa about &quot; just a gigolo&quot; and Nonno went wild).  They had a great time listening together.  If you are like us, you will come away wanting to hear more of Keely Smith, but you'll go back to this one when you want to dance!

B0000028RR|5.0|I got this album a few years back, just before Evil Empire came out. I had heard it from other peoples copies, and I thought MAYBE it was worth buying. Upon listening, I was completely blown away, and couldn't believe my ears. Possibly one of the most polished albums I've ever heard, the absolute best track is &quot;Wake up&quot;, because it is all out perfect. I can't really say that I dislike any of the tracks, except &quot;Settle for nothing&quot;, which is a very boring song. For any Rage fan, this album is essential. All the crap about &quot;Renegades&quot; being the best album by these guys is all lies. Buy this one, and crank it!
0812589041|5.0|When I started reading this book, I could not put it down.  Literally.  I read it at work, during breaks, during lunch, during work time by holding it under my desk.  I read it at home, over breakfast, over dinner, during my favorite television programs.  I finished it in two days, and it was worth every minute of lost sleep and then some.  The novel is engrossing from the first page, a fascinating look at a future where exceptionally bright children are pegged at preschool age and groomed to be brilliant military commanders.  Thankfully, Card lets his characters' actions describe their personalities, rather than filling the pages with needless exposition, so the end product is fast-paced yet simply lyrical in its delivery.  A stunning novel that examines what it truly means to lead, to follow, and to be human, all seen through the eyes of genius adolescent.  Fabulous for readers of all ages.
B000002572|5.0|It isn't easy to show what I'm feeling inside...<br />That line from the Boston classic &quot;Something about You&quot; sums up my feelings on this self-titled masterpiece from Boston.  Straight through the album, each and every song has given me goosebumps on numerous occasions.<br />The Radio-friendly sound, backed by powerful lyrics, mesmorising hand claps, and incredible guitar lyrics, made the album stand out from the rest of the 70's albums.<br />The Songs; &quot;More than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, &quot;Something About You&quot;, &quot;Hitch a Ride&quot;, &quot;Foreplay/Longtime&quot;, and &quot;Let me Take You Home Tonight&quot; have all been heard by anyone who regularly listens to an all Rock N' Roll station.  It's amazing that all of these songs came from one album.  This collection of songs was a greatest hits album in itself.<br />I can't say much greater things about this album, and about Boston.  Totally blows my mind, to this day.
B00004STPT|1.0|I dont like the music of Hans Zimmer. I cant believe Ridley Scott has choosen this guy to score an important film like Gladiator. That was really a job for Bruce Broughton or David Arnold and not for a little New Age musician. Who remember the so &quot;fantastic&quot; score from &quot;The English Patient&quot;? Well, what can you expect a guy who needs a help from a woman to compose a score?
B000022TSV|3.0|I got this DVD and another from Baltsa/Carreras/Metropolitan Opera at the same time and I enjoy both of them.  I enjoy Domingo's Don Jose quite a lot however, I just don't like Migenes-Johnson's singing that much - her singing of Carmen may be the worst that I have ever heard.  Anyway, she is definitely better at acting/shaking her body (or dancing) than singing, which is good for a movie.  Plus, this movie delivers much better image and sound although I cannot get Dolby surround sound as what I got from the VHS tape.  I am more pleased with this movie version since I don't want to listen to the noise from the audience while I was watching it, although the singing is not as good as the others on my CDs.  I just bought one more copy of this DVD and I believe my friend will definitely like it.
B00003CX9W|4.0|It's wonderful to finally have the original Fantasia on DVD, and I'm glad Roy Disney went to the trouble to restore it to the roadshow version.  The only real complaint I have is that the voice you hear is NOT that of Deams Tailor but of a voice actor used to restore sound quality to the footage.  Kind of unsettling and jarring, when I am so familiar with Mr. Tailor's voice and the remastered version that came out on video and LaserDisc.
B00003CXBK|4.0|This movie its excellent, the animation rocks,and the sound is great too. It's a story about the war between men and nature; a prince and a savage girl.
0141301155|5.0|&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is one of the most wildly imaginative and dramatically appealing children's novels of the twentieth century. Simply put, kids love it. (Adults love it, too.) The premise of a poor starving boy who lives near the most wonderful and secretive candy factory in the world is inspired. Dahl has a skillful knack for making you want to read the next chapter. Once you meet the interesting characters such as Charlie's Grandpa Joe, and hear about the mythical Mr. Wonka, you are hooked. The pace accelerates as the world learns that Mr. Wonka will allow five lucky children into his secretive factory, if they happen to buy a candy bar that has a golden ticket in it. The winners are mostly awful brats - each one is presented as an example of how NOT to behave. There's something Dickensian in Dahl's wild wit and unabashed morals. But what of Charlie, our hero? How can he find a ticket when he can't even afford a candy bar? I won't give the rest away (there's much more to this plot), but suffice it to say that there are moments of pure excitement and fun throughout this book that will be remembered for a lifetime. And as a children's librarian, I urge you: please have your kids read this book instead of just showing them the movie version. Let them imagine it for themselves first.
630438551X|5.0|Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are two of my favorite actors/actresses and they were perfectly suited in this modern version of Romeo and Juliet.  At first, you may find it awkward to hear an olden language spoken and guns used at the same time!  But as the movie goes on, you'll get used to the modernized and original concept.  The cast was pretty good, especially Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio.  As I'd mentioned, they were just the perfect match for Romeo and Juliet.  The soundtrack to this movie was also great!  After watching this modern version of Romeo and Juliet, &quot;Lovefool&quot; by the Cardigans, would always remind me of the romance in this film (and how cute Leo is, lol).  Anyway...I think everyone show watch it, enjoy it, and eventually love it!
6300215717|5.0|I'm a sap for a good romantic comedy and this has to be included among my all time favorites.  It is sweet, romantic, schmaltzy, enchanting and funny.  Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is feeling overwrought by her royal obligations and tight schedule.  She longs to be free of the burden of privilege, so one night in Rome she slips out of the royal accommodations late at night to see the city.  The trouble is she has just been given a sedative, which has a similar effect to that which alcohol has on a lush on a bender.  She is discovered sleeping near a fountain by Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who takes her to his apartment to sleep it off despite his better judgment.  Joe is a reporter who is supposed to interview the princess the next day, though he doesn't recognize her (extremely implausible, but alright, it is a necessary plot device and this was before TV was ubiquitous).<br />When he realizes who she is, he plots to conduct a surreptitious personal interview with her by showing her around the town and not telling her that he is a reporter.  What results is a charming jaunt about historic Rome that turns into instant love.  There are numerous zany scenes and lots of slapstick humor, but it all works because Hepburn and Peck are so fabulous together.<br />This film was directed by legendary director William Wyler (Ben Hur, The Best Years of Our Lives, Wuthering Heights), who chose wonderful locations throughout Rome to give the romance a storybook flavor.  Audrey Hepburn won a best actress Oscar for her performance as the lovely and impetuous princess.  It was a rich and adorable performance, which that was both captivating and amusing.  The scenes where she was intoxicated were precious and her naïve view of the world was endearing.  Gregory Peck was dashing as the knave, with his understated flair for ironic and physical comedy.  Eddie Albert (most famous for TV's Green Acres) adds to the fun as Joe's scheming photographer who spends much of the film getting drenched and falling down.<br />This film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actress, costumes and story.  It won only three (actress, story and costumes) in a year dominated by \\"From Here to Eternity\\"(Eleven Nominations, Eight Oscars).  It is a delightfully entertaining story that is as enjoyable today as it was in 1953.  I rated it a 10/10.  If you enjoy romantic comedies, you can't go wrong with this film.
B00000IUT7|3.0|I was looking for an engine that could mightily pull my son's train cars around on his Brio/Thomas tracks. In other words, I wanted a multi-drive engine, and reviews I read left me expecting this is a 6-wheel-drive engine. WRONG. This cute little engine only has two-wheel drive. It does a fine job pulling cars around on the &quot;flats&quot; or down hills but once it starts up a hill it gets stuck. The only thing it can pull up a gentle Brio/Thomas hill is itself. It seems when going up hills, because its wheelbase is so long, that the main drive wheels lose contact with the track. A little pressure over the cabin (above the driving wheels) helps this &quot;mighty&quot; engine get up the hills. Unfortunately my son has a problem judging pressure, so this necessary action causes undue power drain on the batteries as the engine works much too hard while it is assisted up the hills.<br />For pulling power, I would recommend the 4-wheel drive Thomas or Percy battery-operated engines. What this engine has over the aformentioned ones is style. The buttons are much better designed than Thomas' or Percy's; there is a seperate button for forward, stop and reverse--very easy for little children to use. Plus add adorable chug-chugging sound FX, forward/reverse lights, easy-to-operate free-wheeling switch button, its shiny red body and it is almost too adorable to resist. <br />My son loves this engine. He seems much more patient with this &quot;mighty&quot; engine's lack of hill mastery than we, his parents, are. But for the price we expected better. Lastly, buy some rechargeable batteries--this engine is a mighty big power hog--and the extra Brio Stop and Go switch track. They are worth the extra cost.
B000051VWW|1.0|Talk about feeling disappointed! I listened to this album 5 times,and still ended up giving it away. I anticipated feeling mesmerized by this album as I have with Sade's previous works, but instead I felt depressed after listening to this monotonous and vacant droning! The groove is gone! Sade, what's happened to you?!
630575067X|1.0|and that's saying quite a lot, considering just how bad the first three really were. Anyone who can find a plot in this monstrosity deserves the Nobel Prize for his feat. If you thought the ending of &quot;2001&quot; was incomprehensible, just wait 'til you see the beginning of &quot;Phantom Menace&quot;. From the opening words,&quot;...the taxation on trade routes is in dispute...&quot; [who wrote this script - Pat Buchanan?] to an end featuring the least convincing fight scene since &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, you'll be treated to dialogue and acting which would embarass first-graders putting on a school play. In the interests of self-preservation try not to see this film on an airplane since you'll experience an overwhelming desire to walk out on it. But shouldn't I be fair enough to mention its redeeming qualities? Okay. To properly enjoy Phantom Menace take these three steps: 1.Fast forward to the pod race scene. 2.Watch the pod race scene. 3.Rewind. Trust me, that's all you want to see.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I often hear a snippet of a song and buy the album (being the music fanatic that I am) - when I heard Dido on the radio one day I knew I wanted to know more about the dulcet voice that had me so enamored.<br />Buying albums based on one song is usually a bad idea.  However, Dido has proven to have a really amazing, excellent album with No Angel.  I really loved it the first listen through, and now after a few more I am in love with her music.<br />How to describe?  Well, the first comparable performer I suppose would be Sarah McLachlan - though distinctly unique, I was lulled into a warm smooth groove listening to this album, much like the warm fuzzy funky feeling I get from Sarah's music.<br />Let's talk about some of the tracks I like in particular:<br />Thankyou (track 6) is of course an excellent song, plays so well and is a joy to experience.  This is the piece that got my attention in the first place, her rich voice is like relaxing in a bath of warm water with a belly full of comfort food.<br />My Lover's Gone (track 4) is really tremendous, the use of harmony and instrumentation takes me to a place of intimate sadness and beauty.<br />Honestly OK (track 7) - what a cool song.  A stunning vocal score and really absorbing groove.<br />Best word to describe this album: smooth.  Buy it.
B000003TA4|5.0|Man,what an album.....what a band!!.Although Nirvana have better  albums(In Utero,Bleech i.m.o),this album contains some of the most pulse-pounding songs ever written.The songs vary from the  raw energy sounds of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;,&quot;Breed&quot; and &quot;Lounge Act&quot;,to the mellow,sometimes depressing sounds of &quot;Something In The Way&quot;,&quot;Polly&quot; and &quot;On A Plain&quot;.Make no mistake, just as Nirvana will go down as one of the greatest bands ever, this album is a piece of history that every punk/grunge/rock/any genre fan should own.Kurt Cobain was a genius,and this is some of his finest work.<br />R.I.P Kurt,I hope your happy,wherever you are.
B000021Y77|1.0|I know all opinions are subjective but I do not undertsand what you could find interesting in this movie. The love story is stereotyped. The boyfriend is an idiot (which makes the girl an even more idiot), the soundtrack is exhausting and the plot is non existing. In this type of movie there is MUCH better which has been done. Please.....
6303614493|5.0|Ooooh how i loved the part at the end when Devan Sawa was dancing with christina Ricca and at the end he said those four words that a girl could die for if their man said that to them. i really think Devan should have had a longer part. i know people have saw this movie by now,but i had to put my ins on this much love peeps
B00003CXBK|5.0|Some anime movies are made with only anime fans in mind. This is an exception. This is a story with a universally understandable theme and plot. The graphics are some of the best I have ever seen in an animated movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great movie.
6305169187|4.0|this was a good movie but not a great movie. it was just an every day good.  Its about a asteroid hurtling toward earth and nasa has to send up a group of roughneck oil drillers to do the job. anywho harry(bruce willis)goes threw changes in the movie from starting out as a joker to being very serious. Although this movie gets a little to senemintal at times its still good.  But out of the two asteroid/comet movies go with deep impact its a little better.
0671578855|5.0|It's not. Or at least, it wasn't for me.<br />And between the laughs, the most blinding observations and insights, bringing tears of beauty, even awe.<br />Where else do you find cats fighting over genetically engineered bugs at a formal banquet, lovesick officers welcoming old flames home at the shuttleport only to find the flames are now men, the realization that... &quot;Isn't starving yourself a betrayal, too, self against self?&quot; or love letters commenting &quot;You were not a ship to be hijacked...&quot;<br />Best appreciated within the Vorkosigan mythos, A Civil Campaign is, even alone, a delightful &quot;can't put it down.&quot;
B000051VWW|1.0|I just couldn't get into this album at all. Sade tends to cover the same ground over &amp; over again, but this time it is hampered by tinny, artificial beats. Drum programming was expected in the 80s, but Sade bucked the trend at that time &amp; in doing so was a breath of fresh air. Now it seems like she's giving in to it, 15 years later. Who knows why. It sounds both dated &amp; trendy at once. If you want to hear Sade at her best, pick up &quot;Diamond Life&quot; or &quot;Promise&quot;. This one rings false.
0679879269|4.0|His Dark Materials series is brilliant! i finished the first two books worried. Worried that the third book would end like they did. Because these books just stopped, without tying everything togeter like i wanted. but Amber Spyglass does a magnificent job of making sure every little curiousity that was introduced in hte first books is resolved. this book, like the others, keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way. Pullman introduces characters i could never have imagined. he pulls you into the heart of the story and then resolves all the problems that pop up. i would suggest this series to anyone who has the time to read them. Lyra's tale challenges the imagination and makes you think twice before dismissing the awesome power children have.
B0000508U6|5.0|when i first heard Yellow, i was immediately interested in buying the cd to see where else this group could take me.  After listening to the full Parachutes cd, i was completely amazed at its earnest and true sound.  The vocals can actually make your heart melt and cause it to skip a beat. The guitars almost float on air in the background.  Now, the comparisons to Radiohead are valid, but its everything that is calm and serene about Radiohead...not the bang-out-loud explosions that we've come to expect at the most unexpected turn.  Buy this cd, stake claim to this group, you wont regret it.  Hopefully they wont become the next Oasis.
B00003RQNJ|4.0|This one really takes me back to my teens, when the movie came out and my whole family went to see it. We were enraptured, and we all went home humming &quot;Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.&quot;<br />I like THAT song sequence in the movie very much. I think it sets up the Butch/Etta relationship nicely and establishes the comfort level of this star-crossed trio. I'm not so sure about the other musical montages (NY/steamship trip to S. America and the Bolivian robberies). The ba-da-da-dums really date the film (hence the reason for taking a half star from an otherwise perfect rating).<br />This movie is incredibly charming, though, in its writing, appearance, and above all, acting. It showcases the first cementing of the Newman-Redford onscreen relationship that was later so effective in &quot;The Sting&quot; (also directed by George Roy Hill). And it's funny and poignant but yet so real in ways that we rarely see in movies today. When Butch finally has to kill someone after all his years of being an outlaw (ironically when he's in a straight job), you feel his gut-wrenching pain and regret. <br />There are so many memorable scenes: the rain of money after the train explosion, &quot;Who are those guys?&quot;, the jump from the cliff, the bicycle ride, Strother Martin in a career-best role, the Spanish cheat sheets when robbing the Bolivian bank, the jokes and banter even at the most grim times. The freeze-frame ending is so effective and benevolent toward us, the audience. I have always appreciated the sensitivity of the conclusion.<br />This movie is a treasure and true entertainment--something my kids enjoy as much as my parents. <br />The DVD has lots of interesting extras. The commentary by George Roy Hill and others in the &quot;making of&quot; sequence is intriguing, especially when you consider the budgets of today's movies and what they managed to do with so little back then. The interviews with the main players are great, and it's fun to learn how Redford met Butch's real sister and how he tried to get her to the premiere of the movie.<br />The movie stands alone, but if you've got a player, I'd recommend getting the DVD for the bonus material.
0517122707|5.0|I think it is important for people to know that you will either love this book or hate it.  I know of about 20 people who have read this (including a women's book club) and most people loved it.  However, the people who did not like it (mostly in the book club), had little good to say.  If you look at the reviews, they are mostly 5 stars and the few 1 stars.<br />If you are open, like a little dark humor and appreciate good writing this book is for you.  Let's just say, it will keep your &quot;valve open&quot;.
B00000064G|5.0|The song &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is a VW ad jingle.  Very melow, slow music ... this is a compliment, BTW.
B000050IMJ|2.0|The original GI6S concerned car theft and had a load of great car chase sequences. This supposed remake spends most of its time forcing you to stare at a bunch of sleepwalking actors moping around. Angelina Jolie is only it it for eye-candy purposes. Nick Cage continues to play some sort of cinematic zombie role. I guess he's trying to weep his way into another academy award.<br /> It is also amazing that Memphis has such an uncanny ability to get people to take up lives of crime by means of his charisma. Lord help us if he runs for president. Maybe then we would have an entire nation of car thieves rather than the current one of apologists for an chronically lying adulterer. On second thought that might be an improvement. Memphis for President! At least he didn't do it &quot;for the children&quot;, just his brother. <br />So, where's the beef? From the rushes I expected most of the viewing time to be spent watching neat car chases. Instead we get a bunch of film zombies trying to juice a totally perfunctory and lackluster plot, with darned few car chases to boot. This flick is an abomination when compared to the original.<br /> That being said, the flick is still entertaining as a mindless summer flick. Angelina Jolie is still most definitely eye-candy and there are some interesting chase scenes, although too much FX are inserted to cover up the lousy chase choreography. I guess that the director thought that zooming camera angles and streams of short views strung together would create more excitement to what are actually quite pedestrian action scenes.
0792156684|4.0|A touching movie, despite the less-than-believable love story.  The DVD recaptures the images and sounds of the movie faithfully.  But I would have liked to see more bonus features on the disc, such as cast interviews, deleted scenes, etc.  For a movie with such incredible success, its DVD version was relatively no-frills, compared to other blockbusters.  Nevertheless, this is a title worth owning.
B00004YW6I|4.0|Hands down, better than her last two records. I first listened to this by accident when my roommate left it in the CD player. I really like this record a lot...
0441172717|5.0|Dune was one of the most intreving books (excuse my spelling) I have ever read.  Its sort of Machavillian in a sense with spies, assassins, and so fourth.  It has very rich layered plots that take alot of understanding to really get the FULL meaning of the book, and lots of new words you need to know (The Imperial Dictonary in the front helps ALOT)  I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading how politics, mystisysm, and religion all play a single role in the Epic adventure.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Thanks for the marvels of computer-enhanced graphics!  The plot of this film is very similar to that of &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; starring Stephen Boyd, Christopher Plummer, Sophia Loren, Alec Guinness, et al.; made in 1964.  There's no doubt &quot;Gladiator&quot; took some big bucks to make just like &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, but modern technology makes the scenes more realistic-looking in &quot;Gladiator&quot;.   Russell Crowe is convincing as one of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius's generals named Maximus who gets the shaft from the evil son Commodus.  After Maximus is reduced to a gladiator fighting for his life and has his wife and son murdered, he successfully fights his way back to a showdown with Commodus.  I don't know if the events portrayed in this flick are historically accurate, but they do make for an exciting adventure.
B000002LMM|5.0|The brittle ache of love unrequited, unfulfilled, forbidden...the smooth, sensuous sweetness of its realization at last...The hot, urgent, coppery red tang of fear, of madness, of peeking under the curtain of reality, into a world that will burn away your sanity like battery acid in just one glance at its wonders and horrors...the warm, terrifying, fetid stench of something not quite human breathing down your neck as you sprint terrified through waves of dark, viscous ooze...not daring to look back, lest you gaze into the yellow, lantern eyes of the beast...and see the silent scream of your own reflection there...<br />No other soundtrack ever created will take you into worlds like this. Badalamenti's collaboration with Trent Reznor on the LOST HIGHWAY soundtrack comes close, but PEAKS is in a class and a category all by itself...<br />Buy it...play it...dare yourself to listen to it with all the lights in the house turned off...

Could you tell the folks at home what Qudditch is?<br />Harry: Qudditch is a game that we wizards play on broomsticks. There are four balls that you play with and the most important ball is the snitch. It's gold and it has wings.

Do you enjoy living with your human aunt and uncle?<br />Harry: No I do not. I can't talk about majic or do anything magic at my muggle house. I have to wear my cousins clothes that are way to big.<br />Repoter: What does muggle mean Harry?<br />Harry: Muggle means in wizard languge human.

6305627401|4.0|This movie is real funny. If you are a South Park fan or someone who is not easily offended and looking for some laughs then rent this movie before you buy it. The movie is different than the tv show{which is good}. South Park is a lot better than Beavis and Butthead. If you like the movie try the tv show. The tv show uses both witty an toilet humor. About every episode is funny. I must admit that I am a fan of the tv show.
B000050XEI|5.0|OK, so Enya uses the same style of layered vocals and synthesizer accompaniment on this recording as on her previous offerings. Who do you want her to sound like, Madonna or Celine Dion? This listener doesn't and is thrilled (and relieved) that her style hadn't changed. How can you improve on an original style that has so impacted New Age music and caught the attention of the music industry?<br />The discerning listener will discover that &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is quite probably Enya's best recording yet. Every song shines, and her ethereal, pristine vocals communicate a refined purity and sacred ambiance you won't find in other &quot;popular&quot; music being recorded today. I'm thrilled that she has remained true to herself, in spite of her commercial success, and has produced another work of art that has the repeat appeal destined to ensure another bestseller (and perhaps win another Grammy?).<br />Four years was a long time to wait, but Enya's songwriting talent shines in original tunes that are destined to become classics. These are simply the best tunes she has ever composed! There is lighthearted frivolity here (&quot;Wild Child,&quot; &quot;One by One,&quot; &quot;Lazy Days&quot;). There is romance (&quot;Only Time,&quot; &quot;Fallen Embers&quot;). There are wise insights (&quot;Pilgrim,&quot; &quot;Only Time&quot;). There are strong instrumentals (&quot;Day Without Rain, &quot;Silver Inches&quot;). There is simply beautiful singing (&quot;Deora Ar Mo Chroi,&quot; &quot;Fallen Embers,&quot; &quot;Pilgrim.&quot;). This recording is a winner from the first thrilling second to the last. A rare gem.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Ok first of all let me tell everyone who reads this that i am not a huge Star Wars fan like some people i know. But the beauty of these movies is that it was the first real science fiction movie that swept the nation by storm. George Lucas had very little money making episode 4 &quot; A new hope &quot; but he pulled out a masterpiece. Everyone pretty much knows the story line, Luke Skywalker( Mark Hamil ) seeks revenge on the empire for killing his aunt and uncle. Him and Obi Wan Kanobi buy a ride with the ever fiesty Han Solo( Harrison Ford ) to find princess the dangerd Princess Leia( Carrie Fischer.) The rest of the movie is pure genius at its best. I highly reccommend these classics that still are running hot just as they were 25 years ago.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's cd is wonderful. The songs are poetic and beautiful, and her voice makes this cd a must-buy. Her songs deal with themes of loneliness, deception, love, and life, and almost all the songs show some trace of other singers, such as Sarah McLachlan and others that she has been compared to. Dido should not be known as the girl in Eminem's song or as the one who plays the theme of Roswell. She should be recongnized for what she is: a great solo talent that is here to stay.
B0000560RV|1.0|Sigur Rós' Ágætis Byrjun is quite possibly the most gorgeous, impeccably produced album I have heard all year. With their latest, the Icelandic quartet has released one of the most potent packages of orchestral sound in recent memory.<br />     And I hate every minute of it.<br />     &quot;Whom could this operetta offend? Only those of us who, despite the fact that we may respond, loathe being manipulated...and are aware of how cheap and ready-made are the responses we are made to feel.&quot;<br />     That's what Paulene Kael had to say in her wonderfully scathing review of The Sound of Music, but the sentiment fits precisely my reaction to this overdone piece of gooey new age schlock. Do I dispute that Jon Birgisson delivers some of the most soul-wrenching vocals ever committed to disc? No. Am I not moved at all by tracks such as &quot;Flugufrelsarinn&quot; and &quot;Ný batterí?&quot; Of course I am. But do I feel that I am being addressed as an intelligent, thinking listener, and that Sigur Rós wants to win over my mind's attention as well as my heart's? Not at all. This record reeks of manipulation. From the layered strings to the haunting vocals to the cosmic production, all I walk away with is an overwhelming feeling of...overwhelmingness.<br />     Initially I thought that perhaps my contempt of this album might have been overkill. I mean, these are just a few hard-working boys from Iceland, right? Well any restraint on my part was dashed when I encountered this little tidbit on the Sigur Rós website: &quot;Let us add one more thing about Sigur Rós. We are not a band, we are music. We do not intend to become superstars or millionaires, we are simply gonna change music forever, and the way people think about music.&quot; Now these may be noble aspirations, but I'm not sure whether to laugh or be frightened. After all, the prospect of this musical Prozac percolating into the mainstream is enough to give me nightmares. And given the lavish praise this album has had heaped upon it over the past few months, it seems as though somebody is taking this seriously.<br />     I'm all for new sounds, for musical experimentation and innovation. For change. But aside from the unbearably pretentious &quot;Hopelandish&quot; which Birgisson howls all over the record, I can't find anything different or special about this work (and even this single gimmick seems to be an awfully blatant ripoff of Liz Fraser's far superior vocals on the Cocteau Twins' albums). After a listen or two, when the trick has worn off, it's actually pretty boring, despite some production efforts (like those annoying segues) to make the album seem deeper and more important than it really is.<br />     I wonder what people who respond to Sigur Rós' music actually take away from it. Are they sad because Birgisson is sad? Do they feel because the violins command them to feel? Is it a powerful experience because the entire package, from the glowing embryonic figure on the cover to the cryptic lyrics, dictates that it must be powerful? I'd really like to know.
0440180295|5.0|Of all the books I have ever had the pleasure of reading, few can match the caliber of Slaughterhouse Five. It is witty, frightening, and unconvential. I had no idea what to expect when I first read the book, but one thing two things that I got out of reading the book were to expect the unexpected, and that everything is related to something else somehow. If you looking for a good read, pick up a copy of Slaughterhouse Five!
B000003S5H|5.0|Jean-Benoit Dunckel and Nicolas Godin have been able to create a musical wonder.  I heard the song &quot;Talisman&quot; (track 5) on an Internet radio station and thought that the song was inspirational. Then started to listen to the other songs, which got me to buy the CD.  The blends of instrumental and soft tunes on this CD are compliments of the producers work. I would like to go through all the tracks and give input although I think you should buy the CD and fell the music on your own.<BR><BR><br />If you are into instrumental and retro tunes you will like this CD.<BR><BR> Have fun listening.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This is not a movie to be reviewed, this is a movie to be enjoyed.  Titanic won a bunch of awards and I thought that movie was a piece of crap.  Gone in 60 Seconds had me yelling at the ceiling and shopping for a muscle car.  Excellent in Dolby Surround, I turned it up and the engine noise took me away.  Awsome car chase scenes, beautiful cars.  I was pumped after seeing this movie and if you like cars and action you will be to.
076790382X|5.0|This is Bryson at his best - short essays designed for a newspaper column and witty as anything.  Some of them made me laugh aloud, and they're great for reading snippets to you partner in bed (especially the part about the number of people in the US who have been injured by their bedding).<br />Some of the essays have contents that are a little obscure, but there is enough humour here to amuse almost anyone.  If you like short stories and appreciate dry, sometimes sarcastic humour, you'll love this.
6303187064|5.0|This is a great great  movie. A man coming from his death after he was murderd with his wife. He gets revange on the pople who did that to him and his wife. Dont get No other Crow movie besdies this. Brandon Talks about death after the movie,it's really werid he said you dont know how many times u'r going to see the moon  shine. It's a epic movie 1 of the best in the 90's it's a beutiful movie, for people over 15. But dont do nothing stupid like what he did, it's only movie..
B00000JJQK|5.0|In my opinion, this masterpiece is still progressive 35 years after it was created.  The melodies are among the bext ever written, rivaling those written by Paul McCarteny.  Lyrically honest and vulnerable. Certainly not as lyrically positive or shallow as the previous efforts.
B000008DA5|4.0|Brian Wilson at the height of his drug induced creativity.  &quot;Smiley&quot; contains harmonies as does the classic Beach Boy tunes but a totally different musical and lyrical style. The lyrics leave a lot to be desired but the CD scores high on creativity and originality.  Wild Honey is a departure from the Brian Wilson pop/beach tunes and more of a traditional pop/rock album as various Beach Boy members take turns penning tunes.
B00004Y62T|2.0|The director (who is also the screenwriter, so he gets all the blame) has sanitized Ripley to make him more &quot;sympathetic.&quot;  Tom Ripley is only interesting when he is not sympathetic!  The whole homoeroticism was wayyyyyy overplayed in the media; there's nothing here that will make a literate, half-sophisticated person sit up and be shocked or even intrigued. Put Matt Damon in an ................. scene and THEN you have him really trashing his All-American image.  The movie completely lost me when Tom supposedly kills Dickie out of frustrated &quot;love&quot; and then in the next scene has him coldly trying to pass himself off as Dickie.  Apparently the novel has Tom killing Dickie in cold blood; now THAT would be more interesting. In terms of acting, Gwyneth Paltrow was annoying.  Only Cate Blanchett I got excited to seeing whenever she came on screen.  I think Minghella needs to stop making these bloated, cinematography-driven allegories and focus on character, character, character.
B00003CXE7|3.0|For a summer flick this was pretty good, but comments like &quot;Best movie ever!&quot; can only be written by people who have seen only &quot;Caddyshack&quot; and Adam Sandler movies in their lifetime.  The fight scenes are where it came to life; boring as hell first hour.  The performance by Crowe doesn't begin to compare to his work in &quot;The Insider.&quot;
B000051VWW|4.0|Sade deserves high marks for staying true to herself and her loyal fans, and not succumbing to the hip-hop pressures in today's overrated music industry.  Indeed, she did picked up where she left off.  The connection is awesome!<br />My premature picks are King of Sorrow and Somebody Already Broke My Heart (boy, oh boy, can I relate).  But as she sings,I wouldn't want to disappoint my future either<br />Although she is #2 on my favorite list, she is #1 for keeping it Rock Solid Real. Her voice is sultry and stronger than pride, it makes me feel so (...) - Trust me, my love is no ordinary love b/c I too am a smooth operator!  <br />Welcome back Sade...........You were missed!
B0000028W9|2.0|Although this album definitely has some strong tracks, overall it was a big letdown.  Cohen somehow goes was overboard into his own style, and it feels like he is doing a parody of himself.  While many of his previous albums are very haunting and engaging, this one just leaves me feeling embarrassed for him.<br />Really, I'm shocked to see all these other great reviews.
6304078102|5.0|This is my all time favourite movie.  I ,who, never cry in movies, weeped like a little school girl.  It was so touching to see the way Glenn Holland finally understands his son; and deals with the pain that his son is deaf.  The entire story is a touching one.  You she the life of Mr Holland through out his years of teaching, which he hated at first, and later grows to love.  He touched so many people in the movie, and the climax of the film shows you exactly how much he had.  This movie will help you appreciate your teacher more..and maybe make you want to become one..or not.----Jay Campbell
B000051VWW|5.0|This album has been long awaiting. Who could not like Sade's voice. She has continue her mellow groove.  Lovers Rock blends wonderful in my 5 CD changer with my other favorite artists~ Ryan Farish ,Sting, and Seal. Check this album out~ won't be disappointed.
0811826848|5.0|This book is great and gives information from were Ringo grew up and up to the band breaking up. I includes all the info that the Beatles' would release. It is full of facts that you wouldn't know like the song &quot;Penny Lane&quot; was the street that John Lennon grew up on. The song &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; was when the Beatles' were in a house and thought that they were in a big submarine.(They were on a LSD trip.)All the behind the scenes that you could think of.At the school I go to it is in the Library. The book was quotes all from the Beatles' and was put together by Neil Aspinall(Executive producer).There are many different people who worked on this book and is tough to list all of them!
0767819594|5.0|This movie is about two stepbrothers that had made some cruel stuff just for vengance or for just pleasure. These stepbrothers Kathiryn(Sarah Michelle Gellar)and Sebastian(Ryan Phillipe)make a bet involving a young girl named Annet(Reese). If Sebastian &quot;ruined&quot; Annet's life and made himself a legend in school his prize would be his stepsister Kathiryn wich he had wanted since their parents got married. If Kathiryn won she would have her stepbrother's car. What happens is that Sebastian started to really like Annet and starts having deep feelings for her and then Kathiryn felt jealous of her because Sebastian didn't love her anymore and makes him feel ashamed of himself because of the person that he has become.At the end Sebastian dies but revenge starts after his death. I promise you that if you see this movie you'll love it.
B000001FS6|4.0|Hey, so this isn't U2's best album. Alright, so there are a few clunkers. Use the skip track button on your CD player, but you'll still need this album for some of the essentials.<br />First, there's ANGEL OF HARLEM, one of their best songs (you won't find it elsewhere). It has a great horn section and evokes the spirit of NYC in wintertime. You also get some good covers, like the Beatles' HELTER SKELTER and the traditional VAN DIEMAN'S LAND (beautiful song sung by Edge).<br />The other reason you should get this album is for the great live cuts. Highlights include STILL HAVEN'T FOUND..., which uses a black choir for backing vocals, and a blistering version of BULLET THE BLUE SKY, complete with some added stirring lyrics. &quot;The God I believe in isn't short of cash, mister.&quot;
B00003CXE7|5.0|This has got to be the best movie I have ever seen in my lifetime.  Even though it contained quite a bit of blood I found the movie to be absolutely facinating I have owned the movie for a week now and have seen the movie and trailer at least 5 times already.<br />Definetly a must see!
B00000253N|5.0|I am a nineteen year old male alternative fan. My favorite musicians are Radiohead and PJ Harvey. There is no reason I should love this record the way I do, but it has to be the single most brilliant album I have heard in a very long time.<br />Bob Dylan sings (very well, by the way) like a desert prophet, who knows more truth than any around him, and who can see further. BLOOD ON THE TRACKS is one great song after another, from the beautiful Tangled Up In Blue to the weepy, careful Bucket of Rain, this album speaks to me as very very few have before. I would definitely put it up there with Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.<br />What is funny is that this CD is a much better listen than his greatest hits record. It has a coherence and a message that is completely abandoned there. I know this may not be the most popular CD on Amazon, in fact, unfortunately, I'm afraid the only people who even remember it already own it anyway, and the rest are stuck with mindless rock like Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock. Well, let them have that. I have this, and I'm much the better for it. I just hope some curious young fan of good music with a message stumbles across this review and takes my advice: buy this CD and you WILL NOT be sorry.
0375707972|1.0|I have to say that I am extremely disappointed...in the criticalreviews that I read for this book.  It is not well written, thecharacters are flat and lack any real development, and the story lineis completely predictable. Over and over I found myself wondering whythe author kept asking rhetorical questions of the reader throught themain character.  As an author it is his job to supply this sort ofinformation to the reader, to develop the thought processes of hischaracters beyond mere questioning to conclusive ideas.  That was justmy first problem with the novel. Perhaps as a result of all therhetorical questions, his characters lacked any sort of development.Often I found myself wondering why I should sympathize with any ofthem.  I realized that the reason I felt no sympathy was simplybecause I did not know them.  The author failed to paint a vividpicture of either of them.  He failed to let me into their world or tohelp me experience what they were experiencing.  Finally, the storywas completely predictable.  It was obvious that she was illiteratefrom the beginning when she asked him to read to her.  This was herhorrible secret that she would die for?  And this is what we were keptin suspence during the whole novel for?  I was very disappointed.  Itseemed so contrived.  Beyond that, the romance was tawdry and smackedof Harlequin Romance.  It seemed extremely cheap, the fantasy of anolder man looking back on his youth, not the tender love that twoadults might feel for one another. Once again, I am shocked to hearreviews call this book &quot;deep,&quot; &quot;evocative,&quot; and soforth.  Read this again people, look at his style, or lack thereof andreevaluate.  Perhaps something was lost in the translation, but thisbook was horrible.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Forget all the deep analyses of the characters and the film...simply put, this movie is hilarious and touching, both at the same time.  Definitely a classic.<br />I am generally NOT a fan of mainstream films, and might have passed this one up due to its unbelievable acceptance by the masses (baaaaaah).  I prefer off-beat, independent films because I usually find the typical mainstream movies a tad ho-hum.  But I found the humor in this very unique and refreshing...this is the type of movie John Waters should have evolved into making.<br />All cast members do a great job, and Annette Bening is particularly hilarious as an &quot;empowered&quot; real estate agent and wife.<br />The movie has some serious moments here and there, and you may see yourself in it from time to time, but I was overwhelmed more by its humor and frankness.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|All you people (Beatles fans) complaining about this CD just don't get it. This compilation is for the youngsters, not you. Bringing new fans into our ranks and have them realize that Backstreet Boys and the like for what they really are. A little eye (and ear) opening is a good thing. I think it's pretty clear, if most kid's today listened to this CD, the Beatles would be &quot;hip&quot;.<br />Long Live the Kings!
B000002ADT|5.0|About 12-13 years ago, I was browsing in a used record shop called &quot;Sams Jams&quot; in Ferndale, MI, in what was called their &quot;Jazz Room&quot;. The clerks would continuously play &quot;vinyl&quot; of the various featured artists, to boost used record sales. Normally, I would hear the tunes, but not &quot;listen&quot; while shopping. This particular day, someone put on a tune that virtually stopped me in my tracks. &quot;My gosh, that's beautiful&quot; I thought! I asked the clerk &quot;what's playing?&quot;, and he pointed to the cover of the featured album, Kind of Blue. The tune was &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;. Since then, I've owned three copies. &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; fans know of this feeling I had, when I first heard this music. It's an unforgettable experience - just as Bill Evans suggested in his liner notes.
0684853523|5.0|I just finished &quot;On Writing,&quot; and I was very impressed with it.  If you or someone you know is serious about getting into fiction writing, this would be a great purchase (as a needed boost or motivator, or just to get into the head of an author who has struggled with his work and become successful).<br />In the sea of &quot;So you want to be a writer?&quot; books already on the market, King's work should stand out not only because of his recognizable name, but because he has put together a work that really can help the aspiring writer.  He is honest and to-the-point -- he makes it clear that he is not out to bore the reader with every detail of the craft or the business, but to share a few stories and a few pointers.  And he does it very well.<br />&quot;On Writing&quot; flows like conversation and doesn't miss a beat even when hitting the nuts and bolts of writing -- the grammar, the presentation, and so on.  The beginning of the book is a memoir which switfly runs through King's childhood and early beginnings as a writer, up until he publishes &quot;Carrie.&quot;  Throughout the rest of the book, though, King keeps up his accessible tone and even offers a lot of interesting details about many of his works.<br />If you are a fan of King and are interested in some of the behind-the-scenes aspects of his writing, you'll get your fill of details.  And if you are, indeed, an aspiring creative writer and need another's words to feed on while you weave your own, this book will suit you well.
B00000163G|5.0|This is 2pacs best album by far! In alot of ways it's even better than Greatest Hits! This was 2pac's 5th album and was also the 1st Double rap cd. It was also the album that made Death Row what it is today. Both cd1 and cd2 (or book1 and book 2 as they are really called) both have a good mix of completely incredible songs and just a few songs which may be classified as fillers, but good none the less. If you had the time you could listen to this album the whole way through 3 times in a row before you had to start skipping to some key tracks. The key tracks im talking about are 'Only God Can Judge me', 'Tradin War Stories', 'Cant See Me', 'Aint Hard to Find', 'California Love','Skandolous' actully ... most of em are classics.<br /> The beat on most songs is really bumping and it's usually accompanied by a really funcky bass line. The rapping on this album whether by 2pac or someone else usually really flows and is as good as youll hear any where else (and mostly better). He never spits out a dodgy rhyme and all the while hes keeping it down to earth and real. He is the best rapper ever there is no dispute about that in my eyez. And I really doubt there will ever be one to top him.<br />There is also alot of guest appearences on this album like snoop Doggy Dogg, Nate Dogg, Rapping 4 Tay, E-40, C-Bo, Syke etc. And this is the album which introduces the Outlawz. The Outlaws as any real 2pac fan knows consist of Kadafi, Kastro, E.D.I, Napolean, Mussolini, Homai, Huessein Fatal and the only female of the group Storm. <br />This album really is incredible, so much so that it's hard to justify it in words. To summarise if you are going to get 1 Rap album let it be this one. This is Hip-Hop at it's absolute best, even if you're not a rap fan there must be more than 1 song on this album hat you will like. If you've already got it, get it again and frame it. If you havent got it then get it right now!<br /> ...
B00004YA66|5.0|What is it that is so amazing about this little sleeper hit? It's that it is true to itself at all time. It doesn't get confusing, doesn't break the rules it makes, doesn't loose any emotion at any time. It's entertaining, it is moving, it is the best film of the year. The writing is amazing. The story is original. But it is the casting that makes this sci-fi drama so good.
076790382X|5.0|Just when I think Bryson can't be any funnier, he manages to wow me again.  For anyone who has spent extended periods of times (i.e. years) out of the States, this is compulsory reading.  His observations of daily American life versus life in other parts of the world are spot-on.<br />For me, his most fascinating and true observation was that when you are an expatriate living away from your own country you feel an amazing sense of your own nationality and tend to wear it openly on your sleeve, but once you return to your own country after years away, you realise that you have lost so much of your original identity.  Its probably been replaced by something much more worldly and possibly meaningful, but inevitably you are forced to admit that you have changed even more than the changes that have occured in your own culture during your absence.<br />I look forward to reading your next one, Bill.
B00004TJTS|4.0|For anyone who had a dog for their friend as a child, this is a must see film.<br />In Willie Morris' remembrance of his boyhood friend Skip, strong performances are given by Frankie Muniz as Morris, Luke Wilson as Dink Jenkins and Diane Lane as Willie's mom, Ellen. And in a surprisingly different role for Kevin Bacon as Willie's dad, Jack Morris, Mr. Bacon's versatility as an actor truly shines.<br />The trials and tribulations of a young boy growing up in the Mississippi during World War II, My Dog Skip will let you remember, make you laugh, and probably have you shed a tear or two in the end.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I got it for my birthday and have listened to it numerous times since - it only took the first listening to hook me!  I see the resemblance to Sarah McLaughlin, but her voice also reminds me of the lead singer of the Cranberries.  This album is filled with energy and emotions and shouldn't be ignored.
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca:  Andrew Niccol has given us a sneak peak to a future world, that's not too distant in the future.  This Movie is for anyone out there who really enjoyed films like (Clockwork Orange) and (BladeRunner) a future world where you are basically told if you are part of it or NOT.. The Music score takes you for a ride and never let's you go.. Gattaca is a rare gem, and the DVD shows a clear picture. This is a movie to buy and watch 10 or more times, Andrew, we can only hope you might do this again.
B000056N8X|5.0|I give the movie 5 stars only because, hey, i liked it in theatres.  And while this version may be better, i've gotten confirmation it is NOT the director's cut.  It's cut by the producers.  The director's cut won't be out till later in the year.
B00003CX6P|1.0|I watached this movie with three other people and at the end the verdict was unanimous - it was awful!  If you are looking for a suspense packed thriller of a movie - keep on looking.  This is definitely not it.  I was hugely disappointed.  While the plot definitely kept you waiting for something to happen - it never did!  You get to the end wondering what in heaven's name was the point.  It was a big let down!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I got this CD just a couple of weeks ago for my 16th birthday.  As a child I had heard many of the Beatles songs, but didn't know who sang them.  I was very surprised at how many I reconized.  These songs are some of their best and is a good album to start with.  This CD is not for the big time fans or people who already have all of their music.  Many of them will find that they do not see these songs as very good.  But, the work done on this CD is excelent.  I was very surprised when I told my friends that I got this CD, that they wanted it too.  It seems like many of my classmates and my younger brother's (who is in 7th grade) classmates are talking about this CD.  I think this a really good choice for teens and a nice trip down memory lane for the adults.  The music on this CD is light, fun, and peppy.  You'll be singing all of the songs soon enough.  It is truly a delightful CD for new timers and even some older fans alike.  (As long as you like the songs) I strongls suggest buying this CD if you like fun and good music.
0440539811|5.0|and it is, too. robert anton wilson is a phenomenon, a god among men. sure, the book is long, but so is life...do you not want to live life because you don't have the patience? this book is now my bible...it contains more insights and revelations that any book i've ever read...and i've read a lot of books. reading this book has changed my way of thought and the way i look at things forever. the basic overlying story is one of a conspiracy that is trying to immenantize the eschaton(a.k.a. bring about the end of the world), and a rival secret society trying to thwart their thirty-thousand year old plan. pivotal story points include atlantis, acid, the biggest rock festival in history, enormous sea monsters, ressurected super-nazis, pineal glands and ancient deities. as if that weren't interesting enough, the author has tied together historical fact and blatant, humorous fiction in such a way that you can't tell what is supposed to be taken seriously and what is a brilliantly conceived lie/joke/plot point. read it, read it, read it. thats all i've got to say. and watch out for the fnords.(ha, ha, ha, you'll never know what that means until you read the book.)
B0000039PW|5.0|I couldn't believe it when I recieve my copy of &quot;Ready To Die&quot;! i was so happy and so hyped cause everybody was talking about this album and i ordered it and fell into Biggie's trance and his very vivid tales about the streets and about the ghetto and it was very haunting yet inspiratinal.<br />I just wanna say that this album is my favorite album of all-time and i'm feeling it's words and it's beats and especially Biggie Smalls very hypnotic voice cause no one can ever sound as original as he sound's and he will always be respectd cause he dropped the greteast album of all-time's and he himself was the greatest!<br />
6304077955|4.0|After watching this movie, or film rather, (I believe films are good flicks and movies are common flicks) I went to sleep dumbfounded. As an amature actor I found this film a masterpiece. As a movie lover I found it thought provoking. As a writer/philosopher I found it breathtaking. The movie was written and directed like all films should be, the director called all the actors to the set with only an idea of how he wanted the film to work. He had basic character skecthes and a brief outline of plot and theme, he let the actors improvise from there. The result is a film everyone should at least see once. As for myself I'm going to watch it several more times to get the full effect. I understand that not every movie is for every person, but the ideas expressed in this film make one think, even question his or her own existince. It is a film not by one director, but by a director, a cast of talented actors, and a crew. If you love independent films, or just what something more from a movie, this is a must have.
B00000JCOV|5.0|i bought this because i heard wait and bleed on the drilling the vein vidio and that was exellent so i bought this albumn with the extra tracks and it was equally good. it was different from what i had heard befor, all of there songs were good and i liked the way they wern't all the same style. each song had something a little different which made me want to listen to the whole albumn every time i put it on.
B0000025T6|5.0|Its really the best album of Springsteen.Hes telling great stories.Each time you listen to them they are getting better and better.
B000005JA8|5.0|Just what this world needs- another Trout Mask Replica review... Well in these bleak times, you just gotta keep the message alive!!<br />In the past thirty years, there have been many incredible listening experiences, but it's hard to conceive of any other recording that has gotten it so right. Trout Mask Replica is still truly and utterly indispensible. It remains the King of the Music's Outer Limits<br />If you haven't heard it, the chances are that once you have, you'll never be the same again! I mean, it will impact on your studies, your career choices, your relationships, your bank-balance and your whole goddamn frame of reference! However, if it doesn't, take grim comfort in the fact that nothing probably ever will!<br />Remember, don't just play a few tracks at one time- with Trout Mask Replica you gotta go the full distance, and with the accompaniments that seem most appropriate to take you on this most incredible musical journey<br />See you on the other side!!
0140186395|5.0|So we all know that this book has many parallels to the story of Cain and Abel.  What I really liked is that Steinbeck took this seemingly simple story of sibling rivalry, jelousy and murder and applied it to the human condition as a whole.  Was Cain evil?  Why?  How evil do you have to be to be evil?  Think evil thoughts, do evil deeds, feel malice in your heart?  Ultimately, this story explains the struggles we all have with our dark sides.  Some characters recognize their faults and shortcomings and try to overcome them.  Other characters accept the bad and either exploit it, learn from it, or learn to live with it.  Steinbeck takes these simple ideas/questions and applies them to a variety of characters of different ethnic and social backgrounds.  Steinbeck did a wonderful job with character development.  There is even good to be found in Cathy, although you have to dig.  I would definitely reccomend this novel.
B0000029LG|4.0|The first cd is a FANTASTIC collection of MJ's hits.  The sound quality is exeptional, especially on the older tracks, with nary a hiss or artifact to be heard.  The songs themselves are terrfic and demonstrate the bredth and scope of Michaels artistry, singing and song writing abilities.  However, the second disc of new material offers some the most heartwrenching, autobiographical and emotional songs of his career along side some his weakest material yet.<br />HIStory Continues (the 2nd cd) is his most personal album to date and speaks of the emotional state he was in after the allegations made against him.  It is, for the most part, a very angry sound.  Understandably so, but it doesn't make for a pleasurable listening experience.  After all, we all love him because of his light effervesant songs that seem to hop, skip and fly through the air (as evidenced by the HIStory Begins cd).  There are exceptions though and they're amazing.  You simply can't miss: They Don't Care About Us (percussive and speaks out about hate), Stranger in Moscow (such a beautifully lonely sound), Earth Song (terrific melody and message), Childhood (my favorite because it's so honest), Tabloid Junkie (dance song with a message), HIStory (exhaustively innovaative and a bold artistic move.) and Smile (just listen to that voice).  Anyone who says MJ is playing it safe hasn't listened to these, especially the title track.<br />So go ahead and get this double album now.  You'll love the greatest hits CD and although the 2nd isn't as packed with hits, the ones that are there are astonishing.
6304935811|5.0|This is one of the better movies that you will ever see. George C Scott did an outstanding job of portraying the legendary general George Patton. This movie does an excellent job of showing World War II. This movie also shows General George Patton and his ups and downs during World War II. This movie was an outstanding historical depiction of the war as well. This was a well done movie that won several Oscars because of it's quality. George C. Scott never played a better role in his whole career. Watch this movie and you will keep on watching it. I have seen it for the 75th time and it is still good. This is a must buy.
B00003CX7L|5.0|I like this movie a lot because it is a funny movie without a single dirty joke. It starts out as a normal day in Andy's house. Then they decide to have a yard sale, and because Wheezy's squeaker didn't work, Andy's mom decided to sell him. When Woody went out to save Wheezy, he recused his friend, but Woody fell behind and a man steals him! The movie is all about how the toys are trying to rescue Woody while he is wondering if he wants to be rescued. The movie is very funny, but the funniest part are the outakes in the credits. in these outakes, you see Woody sit inside a roll of tape, Jesse break Woody's string, a Buzz Lightyear burp, and Stinky Pete letting his natural gas creep up on him! Hilarious movie, a good watch.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|When 1996's 'Tidal' came out, it was clear that its' young vocalist was no flash in the pan. Despite an overall sense of gloominess and woe-is-me, Apple's debut was regarded as exceptionally stunning, drawing accolades for its' unmissable single 'Criminal' and the magical 'Sleep to dream'. It was thus no surprise that people anticipated her follow up album with sky-high expectations of it. In 1999, Apple unveiled her second album, the curiously titled 'When the pawn hits the conflicts...'. The full title actually works out to a mini-poem of sorts, and one that makes LSD-ish sense upon repeated reading. ...Rarely have there been albums where every single song is an unrivalled gem, but this is one of them (non-believers, you'd have to actually buy this CD to know what I'm talking about). Now, both sides of the Atlantic have sung their praises of this album, and I still can't get enough of it, despite listening to the album in its entirety over - literally - more than a hundred times.<br />The opener, 'On the Bound' is a contradictory anthem of deep longing - despite the fierce independent tone of the title, we find Fiona wailing 'You're all I need' with a passion quite unseen since Sinead O'Connor's classic howls on 'Mandinka'. The second track 'To your love' is a grand ode to love, with the songstress apologising for her seeming indifference - 'Please forgive me for my distance' she whispers. This particular track is very effective, and frankly, its almost bewildering how Apple hasn't got the recognition and album sales that she so obviously deserves. Honestly, don't people know how to appreciate good music anymore? As if to reaffirm my bewilderment, the third, and perhaps most gutsy track on the album, simply floors you. &quot;Limp&quot; which was an official single release from the CD early in 2000 works on all levels - musically, instrumentally, and lyrically. Gripping stuff.<br />&quot;Paper Bag&quot; and &quot;Love Ridden&quot; are in the same vein as many of the songs on 'Tidal', though the production values and lyrics are far better. Its apparent that Apple has evolved tremendously as a singer and songwriter, and 'A Mistake', another of the album's I'm-gonna-be-me-and-no-one-else tracks is highly reflective of this fact. One thing thats true of 'When the Pawn' is that it keeps reaffirming the Angry Young Woman image more so than 'Tidal' and the listener can get weary of this after a point. At places, its Apple's stunning talents as a writer that retain your interest in the song and not the music (like 'Fast as You can' - perhaps the most commercial of all the songs on this CD), but in most others, its a combination of innovative music and sheer lyrical poetry that keep you hooked. The final songs on the album are 'Get Gone' and 'I know' - both sung about a lover who could have done better, and these are among the slower paced, deeper tracks on the set. Not that I'm complaining. Fiona has proved time and again that shes a true master of the Love Ballad, and what better time to show off this skill? <br />'When the Pawn' is an album that you come out of feeling light-headed and enriched - something I haven't felt since Tori Amos' 'Under the Pink'. On second thought, that particular album actually left me with a headache, but it broke new ground, which is something that Fiona has done here. What affected me most about this set is that it gets you in a way no other collection of songs has done through the last year. I've listened to Eminem, played my old Rolling Stones records again, and yes, even bought Spear's 'Oops...I did it again', but I haven't ever faced an album with such repeat value. I couldn't possibly recommend this album strongly enough, so all I'll say is : You'd better buy it to believe it. Its an absolute must-have.

B000002NFM|5.0|Don't be fooled here...The Prodigy are defining their music away from the &quot;electronica&quot; genre and are geared more towards rock. That is how the man behind the music, Liam Howlett, put it in a magazine interview some time ago. To listen to the first three full-length Prodigy albums is to see how their music has progressed and evolved.<br />&quot;The Prodigy Experience&quot; was a much more rave-oriented work than &quot;Fat of the Land&quot; is (&quot;Fat&quot; being a play on the word &quot;phat&quot;, &quot;the Land&quot; referring to Essex, a region in Britain where Howlett resides), and &quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; is a little darker, less &quot;happy&quot;, and more mature dance album than &quot;The Prodigy Experience&quot;.<br />Comparing &quot;Fat of the Land&quot; and &quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; is comparing apples and oranges really. Both are exceptionally good albums, but they are almost worlds apart in terms of style. Dance fans may find &quot;...Jilted Generation&quot; to be the better of the two albums, but the fact remains that the electronic/rock hybrid &quot;Fat of the Land&quot;, is an excellent album from top to bottom, with just about every track on the album captivating the listener with the raw and thunderous roar of the synthesizers, the relentlessly deep bass lines, the howling of the singers Kieth Flint and Maxim Reality, and the exceptional skill in which Liam Howlett ties it all together so that no one track sounds like another, yet each track has the distinct and unmistakable sound that has helped move dance culture into the forefront.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|You have never heard of the Beatles?  Have you been living under a rock your entire life?  Of course, someone who thinks &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot; is one of the greatest songs ever makes me suspicious of your music knowledge.  Did you even go to school?  Ever hear of an encyclopedia?  The Beatles are in it, but unfortunately, Men Without Hats aren't.  Check it out, and gain some musical knowledge before you post here again.  You are comparing 35 year old music to the techno crap of today.  I have never met anyone or heard of anyone who never heard of the Beatles.  I just find that extremely wierd.  I have this album, and I play it constantly.  Every song is great.  For a band that broke up 31 years ago to have the number 1 album in the world is utterly amazing.
0517209764|5.0|Several reviewers have criticized this version for its lack of commentary.  This may be true.  But for the reader who wants a complete collection in a beautifully bound copy, of Shakespeare's works this is an incredible bargain.  You will learn much.<br /><br />I feel that you will actually learn more by reading it *without* commentary first.  In that way you will gain your own opinion of the works.  Any other way would be like someone telling you what to think of a Van Gogh and then seeing it - you would be biased.<br /><br />An interesting note for pop music fans - you may notice a certain 'similarity' between music by The Police and Sting and Shakespeare's sonnets.<br /><br />Buy this book - you won't be disappointed.
B00004VWAF|4.0|...before you start listening. Because from note 1 this recording drops you in the middle of an intense, funky musical experiement unlike anything made before it. It ebbs and flows, with stellar performances from all players, but it doesn't let up in intensity for the entire length of the disc. This is not background music.  The best experience of this disc is had by listening to it loud and uninterrupted.  Also with an open mind. Anathema to jazz purists, On the Corner should delight and challenge those with funkier predilections.

6305842442|5.0|\\"Blade Runner\\" relies on two tremendous driving forces. The heralded visuals which have been imitated countlessly over the years, not just in science fiction, but music video, thrillers and commercials. While Blade Runner itself borrows a few elements from Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis\\", it distances itself from the great German piece with a realism that is uncharacteristically grounded (pun intended) for science fiction.<br />The startling thing about Blade Runner is that every year that passes by, Los Angeles bears a closer resemblance to this skin grafting, smog congested, racist society that was projected by novelist Philip K. Dick, director Ridley Scott, visualist Syd Mead and screenwriters Hampton Fancher and David Peoples. Organ and tissue implants are better known today as plastic surgery. LA is a town in which such an emphasis is placed on physical appearance. Inevitably, clones created from a superior genetic stock would arise in a society such as this.<br />The Director's Cut gives the smoky and towering visuals more breathing room and the subtleties of Ridley Scott's detail come to light. The central conflict and irony of this film is that you have a sardonic Humphrey Bogart disenchanted Blade Runner commissioned to seek and retire all androids, regardless of their own personal involvement in a crime that was committed Off-World. This forces the androids to kill in order not to be killed.<br />Just who is the true protaganist of this film? Deckard is just doing his job, and is, for the most part, a static character. One moment largely affected by the additional unicorn scene is when he finds the origami unicorn on the floor. This is one of the few intuitive moments where Deckard reflects on the human nature of his own being. The unicorn is a dream that Deckard imagines, and dreams are our own to treasure and fear. The origami folding Gaff places the very mythical creature in his dreams. He dissects Deckard's mind much in the same manner that Deckard smashes Rachael's precious childhood memories.<br />I could go on much longer, but for the sake of this recommendation, I hope the complexity of this story speaks for itself. It is emotional in a deep sense and the visuals are stunning for its time. Many of the model techniques and wire effects outdo its contemporary rivals who utilize digital effects. They are close to 20 years old, and still drop jaws all across the world.Rachael's precious childhood memories. <br />I could go on much longer, but for the sake of this recommendation, I hope the complexity of this story speaks for itself.

B000002G7E|5.0|Seeing as how I slammed the 1st reocord I felt obligated to comment here....Without Nico's irritating voice and Warhols control Lou Reed is left as the Helmsman and what we get is one of the greatest records of all time....The seventeen plus minutes of &quot;Sister Ray&quot; could've stood alone.....the rest is an added bonus with &quot;White Light--White Heat&quot; being one of Lou Reeds best songs. Forget the Nico-Warhol record with the stupid bannana on the cover---buy this and buy it now.....
B00004XOWM|3.0|Bizkits first album was good, their second totally disposable, this one is not great but it is fun, in a funny sort of way. First off any 8th grader could have written the lyrics to this one that is true if you dont believe me just listen to it. Musically it is an interesting experience though. It is not a bad album just a misunderstood album. What I mean by that is a normal person cannot sit and listen to this and not laugh at the lyrics, but I kind of think this the general idea of half these songs anyway. Mr. durst is not going to stay up all night and write intelligent songs we already know that so why try to hold him to that standard. Musically these guys are pretty good the album has a fun side to it. It is primarily a rap-metal album it doesn't pretend to be anything else. Since there are so many bands in this genre at the moment that have no business playing music, you might as well stick with the band that does it best in this genre. It's just my advice take it or leave it.
B000002IWQ|4.0|This Rush album for me marked the continuation of the cooling off of Rush's optimism, and moving toward much more personal &quot;Why is it like this?&quot; themes.<br />Also, at some period, during the &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; album the band began writing songs apart- Neil writing the lyrics and taping his drum parts apart from the other two, who work together to write the music.<br />They really like this arrangement, but for me, it is the explanation for the different music. Of course, they have grown as musicians and as people, and I know that with age, people's viewpoints become more conservative. This may have something to do with it as well.<br />Even though I liked Hold Your Fire and Conterparts in places, it lacked a cohesiveness that other Rush albums often had. Maybe it's my own predjudice for 20 minute songs, I don't know...<br />Mainly, though it's a good solid rock album, but lacks the emotion of previous albums, except in places.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Wow your standared Jerry Bruckheimer film, a plot that has more holes than....wait I'm thinking...anyway the plot sucks. But Bruckheimer films are always fun more than anything else. The DVD has good special features and good sound and visuals as well. The actors are good and the movie is pretty funny. Plus it has Nicolas Cage which makes it a must see. Pretty much your typical &quot;guy&quot; movie, a hot chick, cool hero, fast cars and lots of action. Buy if your a guy, otherwise a definite rent.
B000001ESF|5.0|I know that my title may sound pretentious, or even tend to make people dismiss my praise as slavish adulation. Be assured that this is not the case. This album is the peak of hope and optimism, in a heavy metal package. The fact that there is agressive sections in the music addresses the paradox of optimists everywhere- how to be optimistic in the face of adversity, and still remain yourself.<br />As any fan will tell you, this album and much of the thought that comes through in Neil Peart's lyrics was inspired by Ayn Rand. I did not know this until many years after my first listen to the album, however.<br />For me, the heavy metal experience has always been the utter focus that comes from all the best experiences in life- this album takes you on a roller coaster ride from birth to dissillusionment, peace, and finally redemption and fiery death.<br />I know that the impact of this band has been huge on a certain segment of the listening audience, and progressive music and metal as a whole.<br />Even greater was it's effect on me. I was in 8th grade when I first heard this album, and it changed music for me forever. I still remember how I felt when I first heard it. I listened to the album for days afterwards, over and over. Now, Rush's music is the soundtrack of my life.<br />The thing about the progressive stalwarts such as Rush and Yes, is that their optimism is tempered with a taste of the negative, and a hopefulness against that negativity that resounded with me deeply as a young man. If one seeks idealism, books and music are the places to find it. I you seek such a thing, look no further than this album.<br />The impact of this album comes from both the lyrics, which are hope as I said, but also from the breadth of emotion demostrated. It's a 30 minute child-to-man story. All the steps are there- Realization, Competence, Naive Optimism, Struggle Against Authority, Aquisition of Identity, and finally the Return-to-Heaven fiction we all seem to need somehow.<br />Other Rush songs, such as the Fountain of Lamneth from Caress of Steel attempt to do this same thing. It's a recurring theme in their early work. It is also the reason many people prefer their earlier work- say up to Moving Pictures. Afterwards, there is glimmers of this, but it's not the same, or it's more condensed.<br />For me, I must listen to this song at least once a year from beginning to end without interruption- the full 23+ minutes- to really get a feeling for it. I do the same with La Villa Strangiato from Hemispheres, and Cygnus X-1 from A Farewell to Kings.<br />I would agree with the editorial view that they have backed off on this idealism somewhat after this album, but is has always remained until the last 3 albums, which I have been dissappointed with.<br />My Highest Recommendation.br />Other Rush songs, such as the Fountain of Lamneth from Caress of Steel attempt to do this same thing.

0553106635|5.0|The only thing that puzzles me about George R. R. Martin's phenomenal series is that it is not put front and center of every booksore, and online retailer; not raking in every literary award in existance; not hailed in the press as a book that trancends the often limiting classification of &quot;fantasy fiction.&quot;  I know that other Amazon reviewers have claimed (rightly so) that Martin eclipses every contemporary fantasy writer.  What I want to establish is my opinion that Martin deserves credit as one of the great writers of our time.  Period.  If you haven't read any of Martin's work yet, get your hands on A Game of Thrones.  By the time you soar through the first 3000+ pages of the series the 4th installment might just be ready.
B000001EXR|5.0|This album, if it had been released when it was intended (before the reunion), would have completely confused many music critics. What this album, more than any other KISS record proves, is that the four members of KISS...Paul, Gene, Eric, and Bruce, could truly write songs. From a lyrical standpoint...just listen to what is being said. No sex. No fluff. No filler. These are lyrically great songs dealing with very real &quot;life&quot; issues. Musically...Bruce Kulick finally had his chance with this one. Not only did he co-write 9 of the 12 tracks and sing on one...it is clear that he played most of the instruments with strings too. If only this album had been packaged and promoted the way it deserved to be. <br />Being a fan for over 20 years, this is in my list of top KISS albums ever. Very dark, very heavy and most importantly very listenable.

B00000DFSK|4.0|Rounding up U2's first decade here is the The Best Of 1980 - 1990 and this features all their memorable hits With Or Without You, Pride and other classics of the 80's. Every song here is worthy of its inclusion here but my thoughts are that why have such seminal tracks in their career been omitted such as Two Hearts Beat As One and Gloria which were both hit singles not just album tracks like Bad. I know this has to cater for the whole world and so some songs that were hits in one place and not another have been left out but would it not have been better filling the full 80 minutes of the CD or even adding a second disc to add even more great songs and just to here more of Bono's great voice. Despite some great songs being missing you can't fault what is actually on offer. Pride was that track that pretty much broke them worldwide and sounds as good today as it ever did. With Or Without You is just pure genius and will never go out of fashion as neither will any tracks here. I like Desire as it is just a great tune with good guitars and also Sunday Bloody Sunday which was how the band felt about Ireland's troubles and this is brought across really well in a quite amazing song. If i had to fault the CD i would say When Love Comes To Town doesn't quite live up to the hype and just isn't that good. This would be the only criticism to a great album and also the re-recording of Sweetest Thing is just brilliant. Long live Bono and U2 and all we can hope for is that they continue making quality music until the day they die.
0451191153|5.0|this is quite possibly the best novel i've become involved in - and i use the phrase wholeheartedly.  it is impossible to come to the last page of the novel without acknowledging at LEAST some amount of self-involvement.  i definitely would not say it's a book by which one models his/her life; roark is referred to as a hero.  if a hero is someone whom one aspires to be, roark is not that.  if a hero is someone whom one admires, roark is that.  if other critics consider this the flaw of the novel, they haven't considered the loose definition of a &quot;hero&quot; anyway.  this novel could result in self-improvement only in the reader acknowledging the pedestal which humanity too often ignores, too often dismisses as too distant a reach for his piddly self.  the wistful beauty of this book is that hopefully, the reader will gain full awareness that roark's integrity cannot be matched.  as other critics stated, he is basically untouchable, unmarred by his surroundings - well, the breathing types of surroundings in actuality.  whether the reader hopes or not to match this, the fact remains that his character does not dictate the human heart - just its stifled cry for wings.  however, the entirety of the novel may provide inspiration and a much-needed mirror.   excellent piece of literature.  great for any beginner on the concept of objectivism.

1556154844|5.0|This book is a goldmine!  The wisdom that McConnell conveys in Code Complete is obviously born of experience.  By approaching software from a 'construction' view, it is clear that the author is well aquainted with the fiasco that can result from poor planning.  I am especially impressed by the emphasis on modularity which seems to be a dominant theme throughout the book.<br />Also significant is the encouragment to document the code as you go, whether it is a parallel effort or incorporated as comments in the code itself.  (Reading undocumented code is like going down a road with no signs, signals or landmarks at all!)<br />The book also offers a great OBJECTIVE treatment of the different Programming Languages.  The focus of the book on method and structure gives the reader a strategic angle for defining the requirments and choosing the correct language for the task at hand.<br />Even though I am a novice at programming, I don't feel alienated or intimidated by Steve's delivery of the subject matter.  He has a gentle, consise style, laced with tasteful humor and comfortable exhortations to do the job right the first time.  Code Complete is a great resource for the seasoned pro and the beginner alike, and the content is sure to be applicable for decades to come.<br />I value this book and recommend it to ANYONE who is envolved in software development.

The only reason it got 2 stars is i love the song rollin, but that is the only decent song on the cd.
B0000524CY|4.0|&quot;THE EXORCIST (The Version You've Never Seen)&quot;<br />When this movie was originally released in 1973, Billy Graham warned it contained &quot;real evil.&quot;  Perhaps he's right.  <br />This ultimate horror spectacle terrified and fascinated an international audience of many cultures and languages with its truly shocking depiction of innocent, cherubic Linda Blair's transformation into a vile, pathetic vessel of Satanic possession.  William Peter Blatty scripted from his best selling novel which was allegedly based on a real case of possession.  The original DVD release included a fascinating &quot;making of&quot; documentary that reveals director William Friedkin as an arrogant bully who had no qualms about physically abusing his actors in an attempt to get a desired reaction on camera. <br />This new version is a cut based in part on author Blatty's restoring of deleted material from Friedkin's first cut and includes about ten minutes of new and extended scenes, the most shocking of which is Blair's infamous &quot;spider walk&quot; down the stairs. <br />The informative conversation with Blatty and director Friedkin are not included on this version, but there's an exceedingly strange commentary track by Friedkin that's kind of like a description for the blind of what's on the screen.  There's hardly a word about the directing process, the subliminal shots, the brilliant sound design, behind the scenes events or even the spectacular effects.  One gets the notion that Friedkin pretty much made this film by himself. <br />Friedkin makes a whopping mistake when, in describing the terrific opening scenes shot in northern Iraq near the ruins of ancient Ninevah, he recalls the Biblical story of Joshua bringing down its fabled walls.  Ooops, Joshua battled Jericho! It's Jonah, who is said to be buried in nearby Mosul (where they also shot atmospheric, underground bazaar scenes), who had something to do with Ninevah.<br />The great underpinnings of this story revolve around the resurrection, as it were, of the actual middle eastern demon idol Pazuzu from a place of renown evil by a priest-archaeologist (Max Von Sydow) who has to eventually confront it again in a final showdown half a world away.  There is no why to all this, because that's what makes evil, evil; it's irrational.<br />That said, this remains the most frightening of all mainstream films and it still delivers the horrors that generate nightmares.  Perhaps that's because when it's over, there remains the unsettling feeling that the demon wins the battle.  That fear conquers all.  Perhaps the devil's greatest lie.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Who ever would have dreamed that a compilation album by a group that stormed on to the scene 37 years ago would be the number one selling album for the first week of 2001?  But, really, folks, what can you say about the Beatles that hasn't already been said?  These 27 masterpieces are representative of the Beatles at their best, and there's even more out there on their original albums.  The Beatles are the kind of group that makes today's so-called &quot;musicians&quot; seem like grade school spoons players and singers.  Enjoy this album; the music is great!  It don't get much better!

Nonetheless, I must retire this review early, since Code to Zero DID manage to keep me reading until 4AM last night.  I quickly returned home from work today just to finish the delightful work.

0788812807|2.0|After enjoying the classic version of this movie, which I would rate a five star movie in every way, we inadvertantly purchased the messed up &quot;Fully Restored&quot; &quot;Masterpiece&quot; version.  Throughout the whole movie my wife and I looked at each other making comments to each other like &quot;there it goes again, the voice changed&quot;, and, &quot;I don't remember that&quot;, while our daughter, who usually enjoys this movie to no end wandered the room playing with her Barbies.  Disney &quot;Fully Restored&quot; this movie as only the current Disney could.  They must have assumed right away that it needed alot of improvement (mistake), added scenes (to further explain the story to the audience?  another mistake), and added a whole lot of dialog (again, to further explain the story?  An incredibly large mistake.)   Or maybe this was all done to make it look more like the sequel, and to charge a few more quid.  First, the movie needed no improvement, it IS a masterpiece in its original form.  It is a classic story, told and illustrated in a very good format.  The new scenes are unnecessary, to say the least.  Our child loved to follow the story from scene to scene rivetted to the tale, the interaction between the dogs, and the action in the chases.  I know that I loved that too.  Now with the new scenes and the added dialog it is just too much.  The dialog is the most disappointing part of this tape!  The original voices are kept from the original scenes, and new sometimes very dissimilar, voices are used in the new scenes.  Peggy Lee's voice is there, and then its not.  Another voice with some random city accent is added.  The same for the other characters.  The emphasis is on the dogs and their interaction with the human characters as another creature in their lives in the original version.  Now the humans have much more of a part in the movie taking the focus away from the dogs.  The original Lady and the Tramp, Aristocats, and others were very well written and directed.  Disney took those very good movies and did a ruinous adaptation.  On the reverse side of the box it says, in very hard to read script, &quot;This film has been modified from its original version.  It has been formatted to fit your TV.&quot;  How misleading!
B00003XACV|5.0|A glimpse at the 70 or so reviews that have sprung up...  for this masterpiece gives some indication of how important Thomas Newman's score to the 1999 Sam Mendes tour de force has become. It was indeed a special film that required something extraordinary from its musical collaborator. Newman hits the spot with the ethereal soundtrack to our vision of a man who is clearly either losing it or learning to get it right, whichever way the viewer interprets Kevin Spacey's tragi-comic deviation from the life that is expected of him. The two principal themes of 'Dead Already' and 'American Beauty' are deeply moving and pass the test of standing alone, away from the images of the film. <br />Thomas Newman has managed to extend the tradition of exellence that is expected from such an outstanding musical dynasty. The Newman family sits at the heart of 20th Century American music, with its variety of messages displaying a quintessential American sound, from Alfred Newman's scores of the 1940's right up to the present day. Anybody approaching Thomas Newman's work here for the first time should take time to listen to his work on 'The Player' and 'Shawshank' as well as picking up cousin Randy Newman's outstanding orchestral soundtrack to 'The Natural'. <br />In summary, an exceptional piece of work that will justifiably stand the test of time as an 'American Beauty' in its own right.
B00003CXDF|2.0|The antidote to a horrifying disease has been stolen and the bad guy's going to steal the disease too to make $37 Billion pounds. Tom Cruise has the (im)possible mission of stopping the villain. To do so he recruits the love interest, who's just a dewdrop of beauty on the screen, Ving Rhames, and an Aussie bloke who flies the helicopter a lot. <br />That's pretty much it for the plot, but what do you expect from a movie that had the stunts mapped out and the actors hired BEFORE the screenplay was written??!! Yes, the stunts are tremendous. Even more so becuase the actors did a majority of them on their own. The first act, and even half of the second, are good, and the movie had promise, but the second half is ALL fight/chase/shoot-em-up scenes. Or closeups on Thandie's hair blowing slowly around her face while she looks sad. (And the one white dove cracked me up!)<br />I loved the first &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; and wanted so much to enjoy this one. It fell short of its mark, because I wanted to be entertained, but part of that entertainment means I get to escape *into* the movie. When the viewer starts thinking, &quot;Oh, no, not more stunts&quot; the director has lost them.<br />John Woo fans, on the otherhand, will wear out their DVD drives!

Newman hits the spot with the ethereal soundtrack to our vision of a man who is clearly either losing it or learning to get it right, whichever way the viewer interprets Kevin Spacey's tragi-comic deviation from the life that is expected of him. The two principal themes of 'Dead Already' and 'American Beauty' are deeply moving and pass the test of standing alone, away from the images of the film. <br />Thomas Newman has managed to extend the tradition of exellence that is expected from such an outstanding musical dynasty. The Newman family sits at the heart of 20th Century American music, with its variety of messages displaying a quintessential American sound, from Alfred Newman's scores of the 1940's right up to the present day. Anybody approaching Thomas Newman's work here for the first time should take time to listen to his work on 'The Player' and 'Shawshank' as well as picking up cousin Randy Newman's outstanding orchestral soundtrack to 'The Natural'. <br />In summary, an exceptional piece of work that will justifiably stand the test of time as an 'American Beauty' in its own right.
B00004T37H|5.0|Let's just say this.  I was skeptical about watching this movie, I am really not a huge fan of anime.  My experiences with the Japanese cinema has been mainly the films of Akira Kurosawa.  But this movie is perhaps the best animated movie I have ever seen.  The story is full of symbolism and is more intelligent than anything to ever come out of Hollywood.  The landscapes were reminiscent of the cinematography of Kurosawa's epics. I particulary liked the way hatred was portrayed, eating inside of you like a plague.  And how, like in real life, there are no true heroes or villians.  The story is one that someone of any race, religon, or nationality can appreciate.  I highly recommend this motion picture to everyone.  However the violence may be a little graphic for younger viewers.
B000002V07|4.0|I first heard the song FADE INTO YOU on a jukebox in a hip coffee shop. I immediately ran out and bought the CD. I have to admit, I only really like two songs on it:FADE and FIVE STRING SERENADE. The others are all depressing and unpleasant sounding. But the two songs I do like are so haunting and beautiful that they were worth the price of the whole album.
B00003CXBK|4.0|When a movie ranks in the top ten of a traditionally Hollywood film critic's choice for all time best movies, you know it has to be good.  Truly an epic, Princess Mononoke is a story that could only be told through words or animation, no live film could do it justice.  An amazing story line far more interesting than what you'll see at the box office or winning awards at the Academy, this movie deserves high praise.
630024797X|5.0|5/3/03-I'm editing this review just to add that it is apparently available for sale on VHS (it wasn't when I first wrote this), and this is a very very good thing!  I hope now there are plans for a DVD.<br />Even though you can't buy \\"Paris, Texas\\" at the moment, at leastI hope to convince someone to go rent it. It is an equal to Wim Wenders' other and better-known masterpiece, \\"Wings of Desire,\\" and it was easily one of the best films of the 1980's. It is a simple and beautiful story of a man reunited with his past that he is also trying to escape, and, well, I really can't think of a single thing wrong with it. Some people may find it slow or dull, ...)<br />\\"Paris, Texas\\" contains some of the most beautiful cinematography I've seen in a film, and I only have seen it on video! I will also never forget its many touching scenes, such as when the family watches the filmstrip and ultimately rekindles the relationship between Harry Dean Stanton and his son, the shot of the skyscraper as the son listens to his father's voice on a cassette tape, and the windshield wipers slowly scraping the window during a summer rain. Okay. I'm done being poetic.<br />The film is also a statement about the alienation of living in the United States. There are many scenes of modern life: skyscrapers, airports, highways, but they are all have this empty and sad feeling about them, rather than the \\"industrial strength\\" we usually associate with such things. But, at any rate, this is a far cry from a \\"message\\" film. There is no real pat moral or political statment here, just a wonderful and moving experience, also much like \\"Wings of Desire.\\"<br />Rent \\"Paris, Texas\\" and if you see it used anywhere, buy it. It is about as perfect as a film as you are going to see.
B00000BKE1|4.0|Alot of people constantly put down Maiden cd's of the 90's but I have to say this is a solid hevay hitting album. Sure its not the greatest but its pretty damn good and definetly worth getting. It contains one of Maidens greatest songs &quot;Be Quick Or Be Dead&quot;, other real good songs on the album are &quot;Afraid To Shoot Strangers&quot;, &quot;From here To Eternity&quot; and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. So if you are a true Maiden fan youll definetly get this album cause its really worth it.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I strongly disagree with this albums negative critics.  This is a great pop Christmas CD.  I can't understand why anybody would trash this album. This CD is fabulous work of Christmas cheer and enjoyment. Her voice is amazing. I give her lots of credit for this work. O'Holy Night is absolutely breathtaking. Yes, certain songs have a pop twang to it, but of course it's Christina. If people want the original Christmas musical tunes than stop complaining and go buy a Christmas classic CD like I did. This way I have a collection of pop and classic Christmas music. People be happy it's Christmas and open your mind. I am in my 30's and listen and appreciate different types of music and I find this album to be a pop artist Christmas masterpiece. Keep up the good work Christina. I highly recommend this album to all. It is a mix of pop Christmas and vocal enjoyment. It is amazing that such a young woman could have such strong mature vocals. This album has a mix of fast &amp; slow tunes and makes you want to dance, and at the same time sit back and enjoy the beauty of her voice. Please, go buy it. Those of you who love Christmas and music will appreciate and enjoy this album.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|This is one hell of an album. The year 2000 and Iron Maiden is still rocking strong. This album is nothing short of heavy hitting and some of the songs will get you pumped. 2 of my favorite songs on the album are &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; and &quot;Ghost Of the Navigator&quot;. It's over all an awesome album and definetly worth checking out.
B000006OS2|3.0|I do so wish that Turner, or whoever owns the rights to this movie would release it on DVD from a better print of the film. I love this movie, it makes me howl with laughter. This laughter is mitigated by the horrible copy the DVD was pressed from. Sheesh. There is a much better copy available, I have seen it on VHS.
B000002LUB|5.0|After a good(but strange) release in TYR, the Sabs returned with their most modern-sounding album ever!  And though Tony Martin is a good vocalist, I think Ronnie Dio far outshines him as far as being nasty and charasmatic.  &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; is Black Sabbath's most modern recording, it is also has a more mature feel with lots of incredible energy!  And while this album might not feature the sludgy-riffs of the early 70s...the quality of musicianship is fantastic.The prime cuts on the disk surface very quickly, the first being &quot;Computer God.&quot;  A real old school main riff and then--Tony explodes into one of the most frenzied and energetic guitar solos he's ever done!  A truly awesome track!I'm not going to go into a detailed description of every track, but if you're looking for quality metal...this is a must.  What more could you want from an album?  There's angst, great Dio vocals, guitars, guitars, and more guitars!  Highlights are very frequent in this disk and absolutely no song is filler!

B000002UB3|5.0|While Let It Be was their final release, Abbey Road was the result of the last time they recorded together in the studio.  Despite the annonmosity and frayed tensions among the band, Abbey Road shows that they could produce music head and shoulders above everyone else.  &quot;Come Together&quot; has a Chuck Berry riff and George Harrison's &quot;Something&quot; has became a standard with even Frank Sinatra recording a version.  &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; has Paul McCartney flexing his vocal muscles and &quot;Octopus' Garden&quot; is a fun and goofy Ringo Starr composition.  &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; is aptly titled as it has an urgency and yearning John Lennon vocal with heavy guitar playing.  &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; is the best song George Harrison did with the Beatles with it's optimistic lyrics playing in stark contrast to the dark clouds surrounding the band at the time.  The song suite that closes the album shows the band were still willing to push boundaries and it is appropriate it closes out with a song called &quot;The End&quot;.  Abbey Road marked the close of the recording career of the greatest group in music history.  In the six years that they made music in the studio together, they produced songs that not only affected the music world, but the world as whole.  From their hair, to their clothes to just about everything they did, they gripped the public's image and attitudes.

B000002UAR|5.0|After the progressive leap with their prior release, Rubber Soul, the Beatles took another mammoth step forward with Revolver.  The album was experimental and sounding like nothing else they had ever done.  George Harrison makes his writing debut with the album's opener, the biting &quot;Taxman&quot; and also contributes the melodic &quot;I Want To Tell You&quot;.  &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; finds Paul McCartney writing baroque sounding track with some deep lyrics and then shifting gears with the sweet and tender &quot;Here, There &amp; Everywhere&quot; which is so simple yet complex.  John Lennon contributes the psychedelic &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, the laconic &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; and the sly &quot;Doctor Robert&quot;.  &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; has a blaring horn section and &quot;For No One&quot; is another mature McCartney track.  &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; shows the band could conquer the novelty song arena and is a perfect fit for Ringo to sing.  The band started to get heavily into drugs at this time and the chemical influence courses through the album.  Revolver set the bar up even higher than Rubber Soul and everyone else in music was stuck trying to leap over it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|When I saw Fight Club in the theater, I hated it. Although the movie started very promisingly, I felt the violence and machismo was gratuitous and nauseating, and the end made very little sense. When it came out to rent, though, something made me give it a second chance, and I watched the DVD. Simply based on the first half-hour of Fincher's commentary (all I had time for before it was due back) I bought it, and now it is my new favorite movie! <br />The four commentaries are simply amazing, peeling back the layers of the movie like a big onion, revealing hundreds of beautiful little touches that are easily missed in a casual viewing. The solo Fincher track is engaging in its own right, but when you add Norton, Pitt, and Bonham-Carter it really provides a well-rounded view of the relationship of the characters. The extras (on their own separate disc) are equally fascinating, covering special effects and CGI that appear so seamless I didn't even realize they WERE special effects. Even the packaging of the disc is entertaining, with the inclusion of mostly negative reviews of the film (not a very orthodox marketing ploy, yet very in keeping with the spirit of the film.)  <br />This disc is a must-have for any fans of the film, and even non-fans should rent it and get a whole new perspective on the movie.  I'm glad I did!
B000002UDB|5.0|The first American releases of the Beatles' albums were often very different than the original British versions.  Capitol would remove songs and then combine them with hit singles to create additional albums for the public to gobble up.  Thus albums like The Beatles '65, Yesterday &amp; Today &amp; Something New were created and albums like Rubber Soul &amp; Revolver were altered.  Magical Mystery Tour, the soundtrack to their bizarre TV movie, was actually altered to the benefit of the American record buying public.  In the UK, the album was issued as an EP, containing only the first six songs.  The title track sets the premises of the movie and is followed by the pensive &quot;Fool On The Hill&quot;.  The instrumental &quot;Flying&quot; holds the distinction as being the only song to give songwriting credit to all four band members.  &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; is a trippy George Harrison number and &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; is a big band ballroom number.  &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; is one of the most lyrically complex Beatle songs and one of their best.  The last six songs were added to the US release and gathers the band's singles from 1967.  The two-sided hit &quot;Penny Lane&quot; &amp; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is the best one-two punch in musical history.  Magical Mystery Tour is a forgettable movie, but a memorable album.
0679879269|3.0|The book starts out fine (though I find it hard to get back into the plot after waiting for three years.)He ruins the book by making it all religious and adding stuff about the underworld. PLus he seperates Will and Lyra right when they figure out they're in love, though they're only 12 or something. Just when I start to like her parents he throws them in a bottomless pit. Also, I don't see how the scientist lady tempted them, what happened to Will and school, and wasn't Asriel trying to kill the authority? what happened to that? I got really confused. So I guess just cuz I couldn't put the book down, doesn't mean it was the perfect finish for the series.
B000002TYX|5.0|When Anthology I was released in late 1995, it spawned a second round of Beatlemania.  The album explores the band in it's infancy as we get a chance to listen to their earliest known recordings, from their Cavern and Hamburg days to their first demos and audition tapes.  We get little snippets of dialogue from the band and Brian Epstein and live performances from after they started to get big.  despite the fact some of the sound quality is below par, it is a real treat to hear the roots of the band.  You can almost picture in your mind what it must have been like to have been back in those days.  Even though the band had broken up 25 years earlier, the public still couldn't get enough of the Beatles as the album became their first ever to debut at number one.
B000002L99|5.0|The debate will rage for as long as music is popular about whether Sammy or David was the better lead singer of Van Halen, but think about this: Van Halen sold MORE records with Sammy than they did with David...now that doesn't mean I like one more than the other, I just want those who hate Sammy to know that I happen to like this CD...a LOT.<br />When I heard that David Lee Roth was going solo, I figured that was THE END of Van Halen as we know it...b-u-u-u-t the boys did something that NOBODY expected: they found not just another guy to replace Dave who could sing, but he was a VERY successful rocker himself--AND he could play the guitar, too!  What a great combination.  But COULD they duplicate the success they had enjoyed with Diamond Dave???  In a word: YES.  From the get-go '5150' (which is the Los Angeles Police code for escaped mental convict--no joke) was primed to be a HUGE multi-platinum success that would rival ANYTHING they had done before.  Hard to imagine<br />Van Halen being able to eclipse 'MCMLXXXIV' (1984) but in MY personal opinion, this ranks as Van Halens best CD ever.  Sammy didn't just jump-start the band, he helped to rocket-launch them into uncharted territory gaining entire new fans as well as retaining most of the originals as well.<br />Almost overnight, Van Halen re-claimed the throne that many had felt they had been forced to give up when D.L.R. took flight. Now as for their follow-up albums...not NEARLY as good as '5150'<br />however I give high marks for their efforts with 'For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge'.  I have been fortunate enough in my career (in radio) to have seen both the Van Halen of old, as well as Sammy's version, and I hate to say it, as much as I like D.L.R. he was so obviously DRUNK during the show I saw that the other guys were actually getting mad at him ON STAGE on front of the entire crowd.  At first it seemed like a joke, but then Dave's actions BECAME a joke.  He had to stop one song when he couldn't even remember the words...infuriating the band--and the crowd. Aside from that, they put on a killer show, but I wouldn't recommend seeing them with Dave on the sauce...conversely Sammy's version of Van Hagar as many started to call them infused something totally different into their live performances.  I saw Sammy on one of his solo tours, and even HE wasn't as fun to watch and listen as he was with Van Halen.  This might seem as though I am totally prejudiced AGAINST D.L.R. but in all honesty, HE was the one who left the band...and as a result, saw his career turn into a big joke.<br />I felt that it was a monumental mistake to let Sammy go, but with that done, they HAD a chance to bring Dave BACK--which they apparently had fooled him into believing was going to happen-- but I guess this was their calculated way of getting back at him for quitting the band in the first place...who knows, but after that they got the guy from Extreme and we all know how well THAT<br />decision went...(Van Halen 3 is the WORST selling album they have EVER released).  IF you are a fan of Sammy Hagar AND Van Halen, then '5150' is a match made in heaven.er the words...infuriating the band--and the crowd.

B000002UAF|5.0|A Hard Day's Night was the first Beatles film and it perfectly captured a day in the life of the band.  It took a look at Beatlemania and showed that the fab four were engaging, charming and humorous in addition to being great musicians.  The movie's soundtrack showed a tremendous leap for the Lennon-McCartney songwriting team.  The title track's crashing guitar opening and oohs in the chorus give off tremendous energy.  &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;Anytime At All&quot; &amp; &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; are all great rockers.  The album's highlights are the two ballads &quot;If I Fell&quot; and &quot;And I Love Her&quot;.  They both show a mature and deeper side to the band and that they were more complex than just being lovable moptops.  They are exquisite numbers and two of the band's best.
B0000025D0|5.0|Darkness on the Edge of Town boasts Bruce Springsteen's greatest lyrical achievement, including what I consider to be his finest individual song, &quot;Racing in the Street.&quot;  Virtually every song on the LP resonates with the overriding theme of the album: that an essential part of the American experience is exploring the darker side of human existence -- the forces antithetical to the American Dream.  Yet despite this often melancholy subtext, which echo in songs like the title track and &quot;Badlands,&quot; Springsteen, as he often does (with the notable exception of &quot;Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; [e.g. &quot;Youngstown&quot; ends with the mill scarfer destined only for the &quot;firey furnaces of hell&quot;]), manages to convey an ultimate sense of optimism.  Even the devastating ballad &quot;Racing in the Street&quot; -- a paradoy of the saccharine pop hit it skewers -- ends with the hero vowing to start anew and &quot;wash this sins off our hands&quot; . . . .
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles set the bar with Revolver and Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys jumped over it with Pet Sounds.  The Beatles, especially Paul McCartney, were astounded by the album and it helped spur them to their greatest musical achievement.  While alot of people don't consider Sgt. Pepper's as the band's best album, I think the White Album is their best, the ground breaking and influential nature of it can never be denied.  Up to that point, no one thought that a pop album push the boundaries and be a cultural statement.  By creating an alter ego and using a unifying concept of attending a show by the band, the album broke all the rules.  There was not a hit single from the album and the songs merged into one another without distinction.  Even the packaging of the album broke all the rules.  Usually albums were slapped together with little or no thought to the packaging.  The band spend upwards of $100,000. on the album's artwork.  The album's cover stands as pop culture icon on its own and a true piece of art.  It was also the first album ever to contain a reprint of song lyrics.  The songs themselves have almost become irrelevant to the mystique and aura of Sgt. Peppers, but &quot;With A Little Help From Friends&quot;, &quot;Getting Better&quot;, &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; and most notably &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; are classics.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie is an oh so important and pleasant reminder that you don't need to have sex, action, violence, special effects, big budgets, box office draws, or complicated scripts to produce quality.  IT'S THE STORY that drives it all.  And within is a very powerful one but one without a great deal of dialogue or bravado.  In this case it was totally unnecessary.<br />The only rebuttal I would make to any critics who say that this film moved to slowly is that the director was trying to create a sense of time and distance.  That of a life, relationships, regrets and revelations.  None of which happen in a moment or are necessarily singular events.  Wisdom comes with time and in small increments just as the trip (in the film) demonstrates.  So for me the story did not move slowly at all.<br />If you need to be bombarded with the stupidity and inane activity that occurs in too many Hollywood films today then the Straight Story is definitely not for you.  On the other hand if you can appreciate truth, honesty, and the beauty of the human spirit then you will truly revel in The Straight Story.
B000002UAI|5.0|Beatles For Sale contains some of the darkest lyrics on any Beatles album.  John Lennon was experiencing a difficult time in his life, struggling with the immense success the band brought him.  As the only band member who was married and a father, he felt conflicted with all the adoration from the female fans.  The dark lyrics in &quot;Baby's In Black&quot;, &quot;No Reply&quot;, &quot;I'm A Loser&quot;, &quot;I Don't Want To Spoil The Party&quot; and &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; are all heavy and a departure from their usual upbeat songs.  The darkness is tempered with the tender &quot;I'll Follow The Sun&quot;, the rollicking covers of &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Music&quot; &amp; &quot;Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey&quot; and the number one hit &quot;Eight Days A Week&quot;.  Beatles For Sale continues the band's growth and maturation.
B00003CX6P|1.0|This adaptaion of the first of author Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Ripley&quot; series of books simply sucks out loud.  While the movie sticks to some of the main plot lines of the book on which it is based, it gets totally lost as the film progresses until finally it leaves the book completely and goes off into the abyss. The &quot;Ripley&quot; books are some of the best crime ficiton ever written.  I've read all the books and recommend them highly, but any fan of the books will want to bypass this movie. If you must see this movie, read the book first and then bring a barf bag when you see the film.
B000002UAC|4.0|With The Beatles is the second album from the Liverpool Lads.  The album definitely has the feeling of being slapped together to capitalize on the success of the first album.  The album contains one of their all-time best songs, &quot;All My Loving&quot;, though. It is a classic pop song and can probably still elicit squeals from teenage girls.  The album has the greatest r&amp;b feel of any their releases with three Motown covers, &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;, &quot;You Really Got A Hold On Me&quot; &amp; &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; which they gave to the Rolling Stones and they released it as their first single.  Despite the slapdash feel, the album is still classic Beatles British Invasion rock.
B000002C25|4.0|I don't see why critics and even other Oasis fans keep downing this album.  And I certainly don't see why it was thought such a failure . . .&quot;Some bands will never sell that many records in their whole career&quot; . . .  With the exception of Magic Pie (it just rubs me the wrong way) I like every song on this album.  Be Here Now is one of my favorite Oasis songs it's  just plain head bobbin', foot tappin' fun.  Don't go away is by far the best track on this album.  And I love Girl In the Dirty Shirt.  Oasis rocks and I'd like to talk to anyone who feels the same so e-mail me at yub_yub@excite.com
B000002UAX|5.0|After pushing the limits of music production and stretching the boundaries of recording, The Beatles took the band back to more organic roots.  The band took a journey to India for spiritual discovery, but while they were there, their pens were flowing.  The band entered the studio with a plethora of songs.  Instead of trying to whittle them down, they decided to release their first double album.  There are barely any traces of studio gimmickry, just the band operating as a four piece. Sometimes when their muse hit them, they recorded with only one or two other members, sometimes solo.  The album bounces all over the place, but it is the hodge-podge nature that makes the album so great.  From the acoustic based songs like &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;I Will&quot; and &quot;Honey Pie&quot; to the tongue-in-cheek sounds of &quot;Back In The USSR&quot;, &quot;Glass Onion&quot; &amp; &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; to the avant-garde, noise collage of &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, the songs all seem to fit. &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is the lowdown, grittiest, dirtiest song the band has every recorded and songs like &quot;Piggies&quot;, &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; and &quot;Everybody Has Something To Hide Except Me &amp; My Monkey&quot; have a socio-political bent. &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; contains an Eric Clapton solo and is George Harrison's signature tune, &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot; is the first song written by Ringo Starr to appear on an album, &quot;Happiness Is Warm Gun&quot; &amp; &quot;Revolution I&quot; find John Lennon in a social commentary mood while &quot;The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill&quot; show he can be as creative and funny as Paul McCartney is in &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;.  While Sgt. Pepper's is a creative landmark, The Beatles is the band at its best.
B000002LEM|2.0|I just can't get into Sammy Hagar's singing with Van Halen.He has a OK voice,but somethings missing.I've even enjoyed some of his own recordings,but 0U812 will be my last Van Halen CD.1984 was a Masterpiece.The band was a fun group,now there old Men,singing about Doing it untill we're &quot;Black and Blue.&quot; What a joke.&quot;Finish What Ya Started,&quot; was the reason I bought this CD in the late 80's.It's the best cut on the album.If anyone wants to buy this record from me, you can have it for a buck.
B000002UYZ|5.0|While the Beatles were together, they never released any greatest hits collections.  Shortly after their break in 1973, Apple &amp; Capitol released two, double albums, collecting all their hits and favorite album tracks together.  The first set spanning the 1962-66 era shows off their loveable moptop days when Beatlemania first took over the world.  &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, &quot;Day Tripper&quot; &amp; &quot;Ticket To Ride&quot; are just a smattering of what this collection has to offer.  The album also contains some of their work from Rubber Soul &amp; Revolver which shows their musical growth.  The Red Album is a must for any music fan especially those who loved the raw energy of their early days.

B000002UB6|5.0|Let It Be was the final release by the Beatles.  Culled together from the abandoned Get Back sessions by Wall of Sound producer Phil Spector, the album is a fitting close.  The project was supposed to be about the band getting back to their roots and although the Mr. Spector adds orchestration to several songs, the album does convey that feel.  The title track is a touching tribute from Paul McCartney to his mother and a perfect epitaph for the band.  &quot;Two Of Us&quot; was written by Mr. McCartney for his wife-to-be, Linda, but it takes on a whole new meaning in its duet with John Lennon.  &quot;Across The Universe&quot; suffer from Mr. Spector's production, but still is a magnificent John Lennon song.  &quot;For You Blue&quot; is a fun George Harrison song that Mr. Lennon plays some inspired slide guitar.  &quot;The Long &amp; Winding Road&quot; is still great despite the sappy strings and &quot;Get Back&quot; provides the perfect capper to the album.  The Beatles had already ceased being a group when the album was released, but the world was still shocked and stunned when, in 1970, their situation was revealed.  It's kind of appropriate that they never recorded together after 1969 as they embody the spirit of the 60's and they got out before they got old.  Their music remains forever young.
0553106635|5.0|George R.R. Martin is the king of the fantasy genre.  He is doing things that nobody else is even thinking about in their work at this time.  To mention him alongside other mere fantasy authors is to lower the respect and pedestal I place him on.<br />Enough with the hyperbole.  This novel is by far the most gripping book I have read in a long time.  You can pick it up and read the first 400 pages.  But after page 450 or so, I could simply not put it down.  Every chapter is an amazingly compact story of its own, which can and does, gasp, advance the story line.  Reading a 900 page book by GRRM leaves you howling, gasping, and begging for more of the tight storyline.  <br />There is no one else who does what he does right now.  There will certainly be imitators in the future.  All hail the once and future king of fantasy.
B000002UA9|5.0|Please Please Me was the Beatles' debut release and is the album that helped to spawn Beatlemania.  The album is a split between Lennon-McCartney originals and covers.  The originals show a nice balance between uptempo numbers like the classic &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; &amp; the hysteria-inducing title track, midtempo tracks like their debut single &quot;Love Me Do&quot; with it's famous harmonica and ballads like &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;.  The covers give a little hint of what their famous Hamburg shows must have been like.  They bounce all over the place with songs like the jazzy &quot;A Taste Of Honey&quot;, the r&amp;b flavor of &quot;Chains&quot; * &quot;Baby, It's You&quot; and the manic &quot;Twist &amp; Shout&quot; and the Ringo sung &quot;Boys&quot;.  Please Please Me set the stage for their world domination.
B0000039QP|5.0|This two disc collection is essential for anyone who is interested in rap music, R&amp;B or modern music in general. Notorious B.I.G (aka Christopher Wallace) was one of the greatest lyricists of our time. This album represents some of his finest works, and his last.<br />BIG was talented in that he would just show up to the studio, listen to the beat, spit rhymes, and finish the cut in one take. Very few people can do what he did. This style was bad for one reason, after his death we are left with a few songs still not released, and no more in production. This is why &quot;Life after death&quot; is an essential album to have.<br />The first disc, the life side, has smash hits like &quot;Hypnotize&quot; and &quot;Mo' money, Mo' problems.&quot; Although the album starts with a skit which was a continuation from the first album (a suicide by BIG), the life disc is laced with many upbeat champagne style rap music.<br />The second disc, the death side, is very intense and lays out the blue prints for BIG's eventual death. Songs like &quot;You're nobody (till somebody kills you)&quot; really is spooky. All of the songs were from his heart and songs like &quot;sky is the limit&quot; are upbeat and motivational.<br />This album which i can sayis the best one I have ever purchased. Too bad we lost such a talented person at the age of 24.<br />Rest in Peace BIG!
B000002UZ1|5.0|Released simultaneously with the Red Album, The Blue Album spans the band's output from the 1967-70 period.  Despite the fact they only released four albums in that time period, this double album merely touches the tip of the iceberg.  They produced the most influential music in history during that time and songs like &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends&quot; and &quot;Something&quot; aptly show their diversity and brilliance.
B000053ZRR|5.0|I own this dvd and have watched it many times in Dolby surround sound. I can't watch it enough. The quality of this dvd is great. I was at the show in Nov. at the Forum in LA and even though there is nothing like a live performance, this dvd was the closest thing to being there. These guys put on one heck of a show. They still can rock. For any die hard BonJovi fans, and even the casual fan, I highly recommend this. You wont regret it. The 30 minutes of interview and backstage stuff is great. There are also 2 videos from the Crush CD, including one not released yet.
0140187650|3.0|I finished reading this book and sat back, totally baffled. On the one hand, the words are gorgeous. It &quot;feels&quot; like it's intelligent, like the author is a great thinker. I could not imagine what was bothering me.<br />So I researched Hannah Arendt.<br />No one should ever read this work without understanding her tortured relationship with Judaism, her self-hate, the complete schizophrenia that consumed her. She had as her &quot;Doktorvater&quot; one of Germany's most brilliant anti-Nazis, Karl Jaspers. Jaspers had become required reading for serious Christians, whether Catholic or Lutheran, if they opposed Hitler's regime. And Jaspers remained Germany's conscience in the first decade or two after the war, when people wouldn't talk about how many Jews had been annihilated and the society concentrated on rebuilding instead of healing. Hannah Arendt had this exceptional person as her mentor and philosophical guide.<br />And then she had Heidegger. She was his mistress before the war and after it, and she crafted his defense, saving his neck at the trial in Nuremberg. Heidegger! The antithesis of Jaspers. And somewhere along the line, she seems to have lost her sense of identity, neither living as nor dying as (ie, buried as) a Jewish woman.<br />I doubt I will ever understand Hannah Arendt, but the split personality she exhibited enabled me at least to understand how she could possibly deem Eichmann's evilness as &quot;banal&quot;. She was willing to believe the facade, willing to swallow the lie that he was just doing his job, willing to write that perhaps he was telling the truth when he said he accepted his initial promotion that vaulted him into the direct neighborhood of Adolf Hitler because he believed he would be riding on the sideboards of cars as a body guard.<br />Sadly -- and I mean sadly, for Hannah Arendt squandered a great gift -- she is the one who was self-delusioned. Not Adolf Eichmann. He knew exactly what he was orchestrating. This book misses that essential point.
B00004X01U|4.0|Everybody's heard the title track to Madonna's latest CD, &quot;Music&quot;. I liked it right off the bat because I'm a big fan of hers. Personally, this album doesn't come close to matching 1998's &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;. Half the album is boring, but there are some brilliant songs on here, such as &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot;, and &quot;Gone&quot;. But the best song on here to me is &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;. I can tell she put a lot of thought into the lyrics. The song is something that everyone can relate to because nobody is perfect and there's no such thing as perfect. We can finally see Madonna maturing musically and emotionally as well. I'd buy it, but listen to the songs I pointed out.
B0000524CY|4.0|This version's crystal clear soundtrack adds a lot to the creep factor, crank it up and turn down the lights.  Picture quality is great, as well.  <br />I didn't know what to expect from the new take, but I like the subliminal images.  The best (and hardest to notice) being the faint image of the demon Pezuzuu (sp?) near Regan's bedroom door (Look on the left side of the door as Mother exits the room, in the scene where she comes home to find Regan alone in the house).  Creepy...<br />The radio/tv clips are silly.  They are just trailers that we've seen last month on, yeah, the tv and radio.  The director's commentary is extremely boring.  The guy doesn't tell us anything other than what we already know by watching.  Seems like he is reading from the actor's scripts.  I was hoping for something like the 25th aniversary's documentary, only in a commentary form, but no such luck.<br />That said, rent/buy it anyway.  This just gives us an excuse to watch it again.
B000050FEN|5.0|I got this DVD for Christmas and was looking forward to seeing it.  Particularly, I wanted to see the alternate ending.  Well, to summarize the whole experience, I watched the movie, and was reminded of just how good it really is.  Then I watched the alternate ending, which should really be called the &quot;alternate&quot; ending or even the &quot;damn near the same&quot; ending.  There was very little difference in the plot.  So, if you like the movie, get the DVD.  But don't expect anything cool for the other ending.
B000050HTO|5.0|Let me begin by saying I used to think Dylan had one of the worst voices in modern music.  I am also not a child of the 60s or 70s folk music.  This is the only Dylan album I own.  I believe I am the market this is targeted towards.<br />This is an excellent overview of Dylan classics, capturing the musical history in a chronological format.  Even if you are not a life long Dylan fan or did not protest Vietnam, you will recognize most of these songs.  Even the songs you will hear for the first time will be very likable and enjoyable.  The producers avoided picking some hard-core folk songs out of a 60s pot festival.  Because the selections span about 30 years, you get a broad view of Dylan's music, making this one of the better &quot;best of&quot; albums available from any artist.  You will also realize what a talent the man was as a performer and a songwriter.  It is evident that he wrote outstanding music in that so many bands covered his music.  Those songs borrowed by others, along with recognizeable Dylan classics, are all on this 2 CD set.  I am sure there were some good songs left off, but if you are not a big Dylan fan, you will not know the difference anyway.  What I do know is that if you have ever thought of buying a Dylan album but stopped short of doing it, or if you have one or two only, then get this one.  It will be a great start towards enjoying Dylan and appreciating one of the best talents in the past 50 years.<br />Regarding his voice - it grows on you the same way a singer like Nanci Griffith does.  Besides, Dylan's combination of lyrics, style, tune and voice all combine to allow him to offer something sorely lacking in music - originality.
B0000071J0|5.0|This is Le Orme's masterpiece. Where there are many other outstanding recordings within their extensive catologue this is by far their finest hour.

B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I got this DVD for a present. The DVD has so many features, I know see what all the hype about DVDs are. About this movie, It was funny from start to finish. I love the way it makes fun of all those stupid non-scary horror films of the 90's. If you love comedy movies, and who doesn't, then this movie is for you. However, the older you are, the less you will enjoy it as this type humor is for the younger people. I watched it with my dad and he laughed maybe 10 times but when I had a small new years party of enthuastic 20-year olds, it was non stop laughing. 5 of 5 stars. I think the best scene was when that girl went into the gym teachers office and......
0790749815|5.0|Hitchcock had done similar films to this one  (*The 39 Steps*  immediately comes to mind), but with  *North By Northwest*  he reached the very apogee of the cross-country caper.  This movie falls into a very distinct genre -- it's hard imagining this great entertainment ever being topped within that genre.  For a romantic crime caper it's certainly ambitious:  nothing less than the United Nations building, the vast terrain of the Midwest, and Mount Rushmore will do.  That may say something about America's state of mind in the late 1950's  (literally, The Sky's The Limit), but it says even more about Hitchcock's willingness to pave well-worn paths with imagination and  (dare I say it?)  delight.  Some of the movie's famous set-pieces are now a part of Americana, so there's no need to go over them -- chances are slim indeed if you haven't seen Cary Grant in his humorous Gray Flannel Suit running from the crop-duster.  Speaking of Grant, this may be his best performance.  There were several  &quot;Cary Grants&quot;  during the course of his long career -- and here he's the epitome of his later urbane and self-deprecating persona.  He's so urbane and self-deprecating in  *North By Northwest*  that this role doubtless stands in people's minds as THE Cary Grant role, subsuming all previous  (and later)  manifestations.  James Mason is somewhat less satisfactory as the Bad Guy  (his cuffs are as well-starched as Grant's, but he lacks the charm).  But perhaps the movie's biggest revelation is Eva Marie Saint, shockingly icy as Grant's love interest.  Hitchcock remade forever the woman who was Brando's dishrag in  *On The Waterfront*; the result is the Master's most startling female character.<br />If you love movies, *North By Northwest*  needs to be a part of your permanent collection.
0679879269|5.0|This was a very exciting adventure. I'm not religious and some of the subject matter was slightly disturbing but its just a work of fiction. Science fiction/fantasy at that. No one got upset with Star Wars and the New Age \\"The Force\\" Religion. So why get upset here. ... I don't believe that the authority was god. I think that the dust was God. Or the form he took in this story. The dust was everywhere, Knew everything and touched everything we did. It cared for us and love us. It seem to cling to us more when we lost our innocence.     I'm sure there is lots about this story that I didn't get correctly. That went over my head. I'll have to think on it and figure out some of that deeper meaning of it all.     Yet I did enjoy the story and to me that's what's important right. So if your not upset with controvesial themes give this trilogy a try.
B000021Y77|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I had the same feeling as after I saw the Matrix. I was confused and didn't know what I thought of it, for sure. The next couple of times I watched it, it became better and better - more and more interesting! This movie is brilliant and awe-inspiring. Even if you hate reading subtitles, you will probably enjoy this movie anyway. I'm glad I own this DVD.
0385501005|5.0|I loved Mr. Commitment!  While reading the first chapter I caught myself laughing outloud.  It was easy to see myself in the words Mike Gayle had written and easier to see my boyfriend (of 5 years) as Duffy.  I have read portions of this book aloud to my boyfriend and it has helped us talk about our relationship.  For hopeless romantics this is a must read!
B00004T9UF|5.0|ok. i am going to start off saying that this cd will probably offend 99% of the people on the face of this planet at some point. but that aside, if you just sit down and listen to the entire thing, you will realize that: 1)Eminem is incredibly talented and probably the best rapper alive today, and 2)that the lyrics are NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. on one song he says &quot;half of this stuff i just make up, to make you mad&quot;, but people are still too sensitive to realize that it is not meant to be a guidebook for living your life, it does what it is supposed to, and that is be an awesome cd with incredible rhymes and more emotion than anything a boy band or even half of the real bands out there have ever done. yeah, KIM is about killing his wife, but it's not like it is glorifying it. it is a really sad, angry song about someone who was betrayed by the person that they loved. is it offensive? yeah, probably to most people. does that change the fact that it is a great song on one of the best cds i have ever heard? definitely not. this song is an emotionally charged masterpiece, and everyone should at least give it a chance. listen to it once, and see if you don't agree with me.
B0000039QP|5.0|I got this album for christmas after seeing a barrage of the albums songs on MTV. Every song I seen on MTV was well written and all of them had good instrumentals to go with it. <br />I got the cd and opened it up, threw it in my cd and listened. The intro leads off were ready to die did. The songs on cd one are very good, Notorious BIG is the rapper, the greatest. Vocally pleasing, all the time. His rhymes are top, on the song &quot;last day&quot; the Notorious BIG teams up with the Lox to make a truely gangsterous song. Mo Money Mo Problems is also a good song. Very Popular.<br />CD 2 is much better in my opinion. It starts of with &quot;Notorious Thugs&quot; a song praised for its vocals and rhyming. This has got to be one of Biggies best. I Love it to death.<br />This cd, being Biggies last compleate cd/set, is a must have for all rap fans.
0679882820|5.0|This was the first book I bought for my son and it is by far his favorite.  We began reading it to him when he was about a month old. It is easy to memorize for parents since you'll read it again and again.  He laughs anytime we recite one of the pages out of the blue.  It always calms him down and holds his interest.  I highly recommend this book.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I only &quot;found&quot; the Sound of Music about 10 years ago and it instantly became my favorite movie.  The music is wonderful and carries the whole story.  Now, my 4 year old daughter also loves this movie with Maria, the children, and even the captain as they all sing together.  I am thrilled that this classic has been added to our library.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Cd is quite good. I think it's music and rhymes would really please any rap, hip-hop fan. It's funny, disturbing, and in a way, original. If you are they type of person who takes lyrics very seriously, and is expecting nice lyrics, then this cd isn't for you. But actually, the lyrics and rhymes are very well done, in songs like &quot;the real slim shady&quot;, and &quot;Stan&quot;. Among every other song too. Like I said before, this Cd will entertain any rap fan, and it probably won't make anyone that was looking for a good CD, with good music, rhymes, and a sense of humor, regret buying this cd. The cd really shows you Eminem's talents.
0684874350|4.0|Frank McCourt retells his unfortunate past in Angela's Ashes.  McCourt begins his unprivaleged life in New York, and after his father was fired from drinking on the job, many times, he moved to Ireland. The book Angela Ashes gives the reader a different point of veiw on a poor Irish Catholic family.<br />This book introduced new writing styles to me.  McCourt writes in long run-on sentances for example.  It was easy for me to loose focus when sorting my thoughts through the endless commas.  This could have been McCourt's way to emphasize stories.  I am unsure.  Another element McCourt uses in his book, which differs from most books I have read is his unique dialect the characters carried.  Dialect helped the imagination create a face.<br />All of these elements help to create the big picture in Angela's Ashes.  McCourt shares with the reader a special personal story.  The tones he sets are so unique and personal.  The way he describes his crumy life makes the reader so depressed. Yet, the way McCourt shares joy with his family, and his self is amazeing.  There are complications with his father, but love too.  McCourt commonly uses the &quot;show don't tell&quot; method to demonstrate these feelings.  Athought McCourt uses this method to describe situations he does not use this technique in describing the scenes.  He leaves the details to your imagination.  Even though he writes no vivid details you have this gut feeling you know what everthing looked like.<br />This is a special book.  It opened a door that helped me realize hardships in life make you who you are.  They made Frank McCourt a successful writer.  God works in special ways.  I especially enjoy this quote from McCourt that describes Angela's Ashes, &quot;When I look back on my chilhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all.  It was, or course, a miserabke childhood:  the happy childhhod is harldy worh your while.  Worse that the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worseyet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood&quot;.  This quote gives a definate meaning from the author.  Any reader can appreciate this book.  I recommend it to all readers.
B00004T9UH|1.0|Eminem is the soundtrack for &quot;The Future Losers of America&quot;.  All of his songs are negative and spiteful and meant to bring out the worst in humanity.   &quot;Stan&quot; contains lyrics that promote the killing of homosexuals (well at least that's the way I interpret &quot;stabbing a fag or a lez&quot; means).

0684853523|5.0|After more than thirty block-buster thrillers, horror-meister Stephen King has penned an unusual primer for the prospective writer.  This is not a simple &quot;how-to&quot; but is an interesting perspective of the author, his background, and his approach to his craft.  (Although he seems to think of it more as his addiction.)  Additional significance comes to the book because King was working on it when he was almost killed in a vehicle-pedestrian accident in the summer of 1999.  After leaving the hospital, King returned to the book and finished it as part of his therapy.  The book is in three parts.  The first part is biographical.  King relates his background, including his early urges to write stories, in order, in his words, &quot;to show how one writer was formed.&quot;  The second part is a treatise on the business of writing.  King uses the analogy of a carpenter's toolbox, along with a story of how he once helped his uncle replace a window screen.  After lugging the massive (and heavy) toolbox to the job site, his uncle used only a single screwdriver to complete the job.  When King asked him why carry the whole box when only one single tool was needed, the uncle responded &quot;I didn't know what else I might find to do one I got out here, did I?  It's best to have your tools with you.  If you don't, you're apt to find something you didn't expect and get discouraged.&quot;  The third part recounts King's near-fatal accident, his recovery, and thoughts on living and writing-which to him are the same thing.  All three parts of the book are interesting.  For someone interested in writing as well as reading, the middle part is the most significant.  King does not present any new, world-shaking formula for good writing, but he restates many of the standard guidelines in the no-nonsense style that is the hallmark of his novels.  This is a far cry from presentation of style manuals and creative writing courses.  He does provide emphasis on certain points-some of the tools in the artisan's toolbox.  Anyone who likes to read and/or write should enjoy this book immensely.  (There's an adverb-sorry, Stephen-but I have tried to avoid passive voice and long sentences.)
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Many people say she is not a good singer because she is already an actress, ok maybe one should stick to what they know, but i'm sure that if Jennifer was a singer instead of an actress, she would be doing pretty good. I am not a fan of Jen., but, I bought this Cd to see what it had, and I wasn't dissapointed. It had some great songs in it, despite the sometimes annoying chorus being repeted over and over again, it still is good. Especially some songs like, waiting for tonight, that I'm sure anyone who buys this Cd will like, or feelin so good, which is also a cool song that I heard in the radio many times, also, lets get loud which is also one of the best songs in the album, to the duet she does with Marc Anthony, whis is a nice song to. The album also has some nice ballads, and good rythms and styles.

B0000025DD|4.0|A must have for any true Floyd fanatic.As you can tell by the sound samples it has a true Floyd feel to it. &quot;Short and Sweet&quot; is probably my favorite cut, though &quot;No Way Out Of Here&quot; is obviously the most famous track from the album. The whole album is pretty dark though. It's definately a mellow, &quot;kicked back&quot; type of recording. &quot;No Way Out of Here&quot; was written by Ken Baker of Unicorn. Unicorn recorded it origionally in 1976 on the LP &quot;Too Many Crooks&quot; with David Gilmour producing that album. it has been re-released on the &quot;Best of Unicorn&quot; album. The &quot;Best of&quot; is also produced by Gilmour and he plays pedal steel guitar on several tracks. If you are a true Floyd/Gilmour fan as I am, you should pick it up also. It's even better than this album.
B00003CXDG|1.0|This movie is bad. I can't believe that this is the best that they could come up with for a sequel. Good effects and stunts are only good when they are believable in the context of the story. Right from the beginning the movie looses all believability and credibility.

If you don't remember Talk Show... you're like 98% of the population. While it did have a few shining moments, the disc was for the most part gutless and forgetable. &quot;Talk Show&quot; consisted of the DeLeo Bros', Kretz, and an unknown putz attempting to sing. It is clear to me that as talented as Kretz and the DeLeo duo are (boy howdy!), the creative mind &amp; direction is Scott Weiland. &quot;STP&quot; should stand for &quot;Scotty's Total Project&quot;. Just kidding... I love the STP's and I think I can honestly say that when &quot;Core&quot; came on the scene in 1992, my life was forever changed. There are a few bands that define ROCK each and every decade. The 1960's had the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones. The 1970's had Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd, The Who &amp; Black Sabbath. The 1980's had Rush, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Van Halen, Def Leppard, etc. The 1990's started with Nirvana &amp; Pearl Jam, Metallica, Alice in Chains, Dream Theater, etc; but ended up with the Stone Temple Pilots. Alternative, metal, &amp; rock - the STP's cover the spectrum. #4 is not as hard as &quot;Core&quot;, but it is harder than their 2nd and 3rd albums. There are some lighter tunes that have a late 1960's tone (&quot;Atlanta&quot; &amp; &quot;I Got You&quot;) to them as well as some hard crunching heart pounding adrenaline surging songs (&quot;Down&quot; &amp; &quot;Heaven &amp; Hot Rods&quot;) that make you want to slap your little sister silly with a wet noodle. Other wonderfully different songs are &quot;Church On Tuesday&quot; and &quot;Sour Girl&quot;. The STP's continue the pace of the hard rocking route, but they throw in a few (almost) weird songs to throw you off a bit. You may find your brain asking yourself, &quot;Is this a hard rock band, an alternative band, a progressive alternative metal rock band...?? I think this is the mark of a truly great band. STP fans will dig #4... and it gets better after repeated spins.lternative metal rock band...?? I think this is the mark of a truly great band. STP fans will dig #4... and it gets better after repeated spins.
B000005J56|5.0|The attention and success of this CD is well deserved.  Sensual, spicy music played by old timers that still have what it takes.  But I did not like the follow up solo records as much.  For more of the same (good lyrics, impecable production, good arrangements, that 1950's feeling) try instead Cachao's Master Sessions Vol 1 and 2. Or Gloria Estefan's modern classic Mi Tierra.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Being a huge fan of the comics and cartoon series of X-Men, I was excited to hear about this movie :)<br />I must confess the first time I saw it was on my comp. I had downloaded a ripped *.asf of it. And it was GREAT! <br />I then went to see it in theaters to experience it on the big screen, and Wow! <br />The story line about criticism about those who are different was clear. The actors were great (Hugh Jackman did an amazing job, along with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen)!<br />Overall, I give this movie 20/10. The DVD was excellent and worth every penny!<br />Looking foward to the sequel! Great job Bryan Singer!
B00004XOWM|1.0|I'll make it simple.  Limp bizkit is a band who sold out to get known and to sell.  Three Dollar Bill will definitely be their best album, they will never top it.  The band members lack talent, all Wes knows how to play are power chords, John's drums are awful, all he knows hot to hit are the bass drum and snare drum, Sam's bass, is worser than significant other.  Sure, they seem like cool guys, but they need to focus more on their music not focus on making noise elsewhere, make noise, but good noise in the studio.  But go ahead and buy this album, you have your own opinions.
B0000041A9|4.0|Okay, so a couple of years have passed by and my opinions AGAINST this recording have become somewhat moderate.. and, even though it doesn't REALLY matter, seeing as how my review seems to get on the nerves of so many Slava lovers out there I am changing my words.. this is what Edit button is for, yes? :)<br />I still don't like this recording as much as I like some others which I mention below. Why: for me this often sounds more technical than musical, although of course still musical than un-musical, mostly due to places where things are played too fast to appreciate the phrase. For example, the way the Rondo in the g minor sonata is played on this recording directs the attention to the extremely-clean fast notes rather than the musical value of the phrases. It goes by so fast that I can't even recall what notes I just heard; what is this, Paganini? Even in the first movement of the A Major Sonata (No. 3), rushed moments are found at differet places. <br />Nevertheless, Rostropovich does put out a great amount of lyricism in this recording. Richter is, of course, just awesome, and between these two musical giants are many a great moment of musical subtleties and blood-boiling fire, and it would be completely mindless of anyone to call this recording, out of all adjectives, banal. Moments like the beginning of the second movement of the A Major Sonata are simply ethereal (although again, I just can't like how he bams right up to the top just before it goes to Allegro vivace - but then the Allegro vivace is played with exemplary control and lyricism). There now.. happy? :) <br />So I hope this now brings all of us to reconciliation. I do know what I'm talking about, and I love Slava and I love the way he plays (most things), have enormous respect for Richter; and I, too, like numerous things in this recording. See, I bumped my stars up to 4 now! But we still have differences in our tastes and though I do not mean to dismiss a certain universality of things truly beautiful, to each his own.. although I think I have made up for my \\"insult\\" to your music gods now. :)<br />And for those of the unconcerned party, I also suggest Ma/Ax recording of the sonatas and variations for their most unaffected and fresh interpretation; for the Beethovenian temper, passion and lyricism, Du Pre/Barenboim performance is  worthy of every bit of your investment. A more classical presentation of extremely refined taste is the Fournier/Kempff set, which also contains all the other works for cello and piano composed by Beethoven at a super budget price.
B00004XONN|4.0|I've noticed a tendency with fans of groups like Radiohead, and also with progressive rockers like Yes (GREAT group!).  Diehard fans will worship anything they put out.  This is definately the case with Kid A.  People are entitled to their opinion, but in mine, Kid A is a good album, almost but not quite great.  It has moments of sheer genius that leave me in awe.  My definate favorites are National Anthem and Motion Picture Soundtrack.  National Anthem (which my band has covered several times; I am the bassist, so I get to do the simple but infectious bass riff) is a spectacular idea, layering progressively wilder jazz horn cacaphony onto a solid unchanging bass groove.  It is so original.  Motion Picture Soundtrack is the most beautiful song on the album, starting with an soft pipe organ.  It climaxes with this choir sound and makes an unbelievably moving ending track.  Optimistic is an averagish radio single type.  The opener, Everything in its Right Place, stuck in my head due to the also infectious electric piano part.  Other than that, most of the actual songwriting seemed a bit inferior to me, musically.  The melodies of most of the song seemed a bit weak and run-of-the-mill.  Not a lot of musical creativity, just a lot of experimentation.  Thats fine though...if you see it as an artistic statement, and not so much music, it can be considered &quot;perfect&quot;.  It is a good album to listen to all at once.  Dont buy this expecting the exceptional musical genius of OK Computer, but buy it if you are a Radiohead fan, or like ambient music.  It is better than most of the stuff out there, just not the Album To End All Albums Just Because It Has Radiohead On The Cover like a lot of these other people are saying.  People who say stuff like &quot;you just dont understand it&quot; or &quot;it must be over your head&quot; are rather full of excrement anyway.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|While not exactly Academy Award material, Gone In 60 Seconds should at least receive the auto-show club award of the year for best presentation and showcase of some mighty fine actors; the vast array of awesome and powerful sporty muscle and exotic cars ! With her gorgeous streamlined curves and a front and rear end that just wouldn't quit, best actress award should go to &quot;Eleanor&quot; (O.K., so Angelina Jolie is not so bad herself in her tom-boy,scruffy blonde image). Eleanor as the '67 Shelby Mustang GT 500 turned in an outstanding and powerfully-driven performance. O.K., enough of the auto puns and cliches. However, speaking of puns and cliches, the one scene where they could have done without was the scene with Cage and Jolie waiting to steal one of the cars where Jolie and Cage start making sexual references about male and female genitalia and the sex act in relation to car parts during a semi-heated romantic scene. Other than this contrived scene, performances by Duvall and other actors were above average to convincible as car thieves. As a multitude of other critics have already pointed out the film is not food for deep thought,or any other kind of thought except sheer fun, adventure, excitement, entertainment, and CARS !All say one thing--ADRENALINE ! Gone in 60 Seconds is truly the stuff action packed films with a so-so story line are made up of. Nothing pretentious or stuffy.Just casual fun...Take it at face value it it is truly a fun film (visual and audio-wise as well)...<br />One last comment;For some odd reason I kept on expecting or thinking that Billy Bob Thornton would have also been good for one of the roles in this film or a quick cameo as a mechanic (maybe it's the Angelina Jolie connection or somethin').Hmmm...
B00004YRQA|5.0|I considered buying an unofficial memory card. After reading the reviews, I reconsidered and spent the extra money. It is very worth and don't fall for anything else. This memory card is well worth the money (50 Canadian Dollars!) It is a great value.
B000002LIX|5.0|I was introduced to Jane's addiction in early '89 with &quot;Nothing's Shocking&quot; and was an instant fan from then onward. Two years later, I saw them with Rollins Band opening for them, and at the 1st Lollapalooza tour. The glamour, power and the sheer twisted insanity of this band is difficult to describe into words...it's like describing an acid trip in writing. It cannot be done. These 4 guys KNEW what sonic beauty and passion in music was about, and took it to a level unmatched to this day. They can excite, ignite, incite, and leave you with the best aural orgasm you ever had! They were the Led Zeppelin of alternative metal-rock and can STILL send shivers up and down my spine. You want power? You want glory? You crave the chaotic beauty and elegant insanity of a true-blue rock 'n roll lifestyle?!? Listen to these guys; you and your naked lovers will be glad you did...
0399146253|5.0|This book is amazing.  I have read all of Cornwell's books and this one was just like all the rest - out of this world.  It starts out a little slow - but once the train is full steam ahead there is no stopping it!  I couldn't put it down.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Very few movies in the past ten years or so have caught more than my attention to want to review them with so much praise for director, actors, and yes (something that is quite overlooked and muddled in some of today's Hollywood blockbuster extravaganzas) the STORY !Gladiator is one of them (sorry Titanic or Phantom Menace, you were close runners up in my list) Where Ridley Scott was once ridiculed for directing such cult sleepers like BladeRunner or being coined as a sci-fi director only associated with Alien he has outdone himself with this astounding piece of cinematic art.As an Arizona native I, too, like Scott saw the gladiator painting in a Phoenix, Arizona museum that inspired him and his sense of direction for the &quot;look&quot; of the film. He captured it magnificently ! The only minor annoyance was the shaky and jittery camera work during the battle between the Romans and Germanians;I soon understood the overall effect and purpose of this. It was very symbolic that in time of war nothing is perfectly still or &quot;aesthetically&quot; balanced or pleasing to the eye;It is all chaos and destruction without any sense of focus.Ridley Scott put the viewer in the middle of the battlefield with this technique!...Also, while maybe Ridley Scott might have been influenced at all by such other gladiator classics like Spartacus, he avoided using typical Hollywood golden era movie star images (the good looking chiseled chin American actor witht the stylized 1940's or 50's slick haircut to play a Roman soldier in ancient times). Yet, as stated in the 2nd dvd disc he also avoided making Gladiator a typical historical time piece that read like a world history lesson in highschool from a text book ! Scott knew how to balance his directorial means...<br />Actor Russell Crowe has definitley cemented his bonafide great actor status with this role. Had a stereotypical Hollywood pretty boy played the role it would not have had a very profound and credible overall effect to draw interest to the main chartacter Maximus.Connie Nielsen as Lucilla also proved herself very worthy ! Joaquin Phoenix played Commodus with every bit of flamboyant evil verve (almost melo-dramatic) but it worked.Actor or Sir Richard Harris gives a very fine and strong performance that does bring some classy ambiance to Gladiator when the heartwrenching story is anything but;He is a powerful presence in the film as well.<br />The Hans Zimmer soundtrack is one of the most haunting and evocative scores that will stay in the viewer's mind for quite some time.It is both compelling and ethereal in nature that exquisitely expresses every nuance, emotion, and motion of the film and characters precisely...<br />The dvd bonus material disc is every bit a treasure and wealth of information on the making of the film and the history of the the &quot;real&quot; Roman gladiators. The day by day diary of filming by one of the actors is an enjoyable read (if your eyes don't strain from reading your t.v. screen).<br />With entire contents and packaging of this film it is a definite keeper for any serious movie or dvd collector.However, don't just buy it on the basis of the technical dvd aspects but rather on what is really the heart of the package;The film itself ! ...
6305131406|4.0|The first of these three is a classic. Stallone as the vagrant Vietnam veteran falsely arrested and escaping to rage a one man war on the officers who are after him. With a great atmosphere and a small death count, you see that action films don't necessarily have to have lots of people being killed to succeed.<br />First Blood part 2 is not as good but is still enjoyable and takes the format of a normal action film with Rambo rescuing P.O.W's from Nam.<br />Rambo 3 is again similar to 2 with Rambo mounting a rescue mission to save his friend Colonel Trautman. <br />Overall, many hours of entertainment that you will enjoy, and despite a slightly dodgy third installment, still worth the money.
6305171769|5.0|I thought that Halloween H20 was the best Halloween ever. It had a great cast of today's hottest stars.I bought it for 6.99 as a pre-viewed movie and I honestly though it was the best movie ever made.I've watched it 8 times since buying the video.
0679890475|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this book-and all the others by P.D. Eastman.  We may have to buy another as she particularly enjoyed teething on it before she started enjoying the book for the story.  I am not sure if it is the story itself or the illustrations (she especially likes the cow) but I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a book to give a little one.  We just received &quot;The Alphabet Book&quot; which is also one of her favorites, and I have ordered &quot;Go Dog, Go&quot; for her as well.
B00004RF9B|5.0|While you watch this movie, keep reminding yourself that it was made in 1956. What Star Wars did for visual effects in the 70's, this film did in the 50's.  I haven't seen any other film from that time period that is as visually stunning and realistic.<br />Believable acting throughout the film, marred only by the stereotypical 50's style comic relief.  Any cinema buff would want this in their collection.
0441172717|5.0|Don't get me wrong - I like science fiction as a genre, but some of it is just too technical and unbelievable.  I'm more of a history fan.  And I guess that's why Dune is so appealing - it is a very well crafted science fiction novel, but because of the concept of the family histories, the trade wars and other issues it has the feel of a historical saga as well.<br />In addition there are great characters, inhospitable deserts, evil bad guys and giant worms.  What more could a person want?  But all in all its a real saga - a great book and a great read.  Science fiction fans rejoice, and those who wouldn't normally consider such a book will also enjoy it.
6305558167|4.0|This is one of my favorite all time movies.  There's no better Arthurian movie around.  It's got brilliant characterization, a feast for the eyes and terrific sound.  I saw it years ago, and had to have it as one of the first DVD's I bought.  <br />It's a story almost everyone already knows, but the way it is portrayed here is masterful.  Each scene sets the current mood of Camelot.  If you turn off the sound you can easily watch the rise and fall of Camelot just from the sets and lighting.  Superbly subtle.  <br />Any sword/sorcer/mythos geek has to have this movie.
0399146253|1.0|I usually enjoy Cornwell as a quick, mindless, entertaining read, however I am unable to finish &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;.  I am half way though and loath the thought that I may pick it up out of morbid curiosity to see how it ends.<br />The writing is choppy and unclean.  A 12-year-old could have written the first two chapters due to their simple sentences and syntax.  Later in the book there are huge chunks that read as if they were hastily added filler.  <br />When writing a sequel an author needs to walk the fine line between boring readers of the first novel and alienating new readers.  Cornwell does not do this well at all in &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;.  I glossed over whole pages of badly written background information that was clumsily inserted throughout the book.<br />Worse than the hack writing, are the characters who have become characatures of themselves.  Marino is gruffer and even less PC than usual, Lucy is still a precocious yet absentee niece (and yes, Cornwell fears that lest we forget, she is still a lesbian), Kay is wallowing in self-absorption.  <br />The whole tone of Kay's monologue (yes, that's what this book is - &quot;Kay's whinging monologue&quot;) is maudlin.  This is exacerbated by her interactions with Anna, her friend the shrink, who's only raison d'être so far is to give Kay a sounding board for the regurgitation of her woes.  <br />Three books ago I would never have thought that I would one day hate these people and want them to go away. Someone needs to tell Patricia Cornwell about character development.<br />&quot;The Last Precinct&quot; reads as if Cornwell had written under duress to fulfill a contract.  It would seem that she is as tired of her characters and the story as I am.  Time to hang it up?
B00003CX8J|4.0|Finally, a decent movie made about a great comic book!  A rarity for anyone who's seen The Punisher, Superman, or the multiple Spiderman flicks!  <br />Excellent storyline and characterization.  Would have loved to see more back story, hopefully there will be that in the sequel.
0783226063|3.0|Here's my problems with Dune, editing, the story is very entertaining up to the part where Paul and his mom are stranded out in the desert. Then the film takes a dive off a cliff, crashes and burns. Very lengthy and important parts of the novel are skipped over with just two sentences in the second half of the movie, they would have made entertaining parts of the film too! Some very important characters are barely in the film for 3 minutes, and the last 40 minutes are mind bogglingly incomprehensible and sloppy!<br />I'm not talking about Lynch's direction either, I'm more talking about his editing, I mean, I have NO IDEA whats supposed to be happening in the second half, who these characters are, what they are doing, and again, that embarrassing skip through the middle and the end, and main parts of the story itself. Imagine this, a film is going fine and well and the story is great, then say some mad person got a pair of scissors and started randomly cutting large parts of the film away, well thats what your seeing, so many things under developed, not enough explored, it could have been good like that too but the again the ending so horribly edited, the best part of the novel completely left out!<br />But on the bright side there are wonderfully dark sets and costumes, Lynch's direction is claustrophobic and hypnotic. Some people say the special effects are pretty bad, well if your going for realism I guess they are (except for the spice mines which are great looking and very realistic, but again, they are only in the movie for about 1 minute), but they give this film an other worldly quality.<br />Very disappointing and very unfinished movie, still very entertaining to watch, must be seen in widescreen only! There is an 190 minute cut which doesn't do much but make the film seem even sloppier. The best way to describe this movie is as one Dune fan said, a 2 hour trailer for an unfilmed 12 hour movie.
0785784659|5.0|'Long Walk to Freedom' is not a thriller, nor a novelists dream, but it is one that will stay with me always. An important story about Apartheid and an inside look at those living it. I wish that I could convince everyone that I knew to sit this book out, to review it and take it's lessons to heart. I found myself bookmarking many a page, just so that I could go back and study certain quotes, or things that were difficult for me to contemplate, but were NECESSARY for me to understand. There are so many things that are accesible to everyone- aids that will help them to open their minds and souls to the idea of freedom and equality towards every race, every background. But so often they go unread, unstudied. I urge you to have this book in your hands, in your heart, and later on your shelf to share with all who may come across it. Knowledge makes for a better tomorrow, and this book enlightens, encourages, and inspires. A must read.
6304711905|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Despite a few artistic deviations from historical fact, this movie resembles the actual Earp story better than most that have come before it. Dramatic and well-acted, I would consider this movie a must for any Earp buffs out there, as well as for those who just love a good western. Kurt Russell actually resembles Earp a great deal, and seems to capture some of the seeming hipocracies of the famous lawman. I my opinion, Val Kilmer, usually underrated as an actor, delivers a wonderful, over-the-top performance as Doc Holliday, almost stealing the movie.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|This movie makes you laugh histarically, but it's jokes are somewhat repititious and if you see this movie more than 3-4 times, you get bored.

B0000508U6|3.0|I first read about the band through Billboard magazine's web site and how they were a huge success in the UK.  Then only a month ago, I heard &quot;Yellow&quot; on the local radio station here in Detroit.  After liking the song very much, I decided to take a chance by buying the CD.<br />For the most part, the CD doesn't disappoint.  A few words would describe the music:  moody, melodic, atmospheric, lo-fi.  And yes even depressing at times.  But the band's seemingly depressing music comes across to me as uplifting in a strange way.  Both the lead singer's soaring voice and the soft guitar playing are hauntingly beautiful.  It reminds me of standing out in the middle of a beach watching the sunrise.<br />In any case, if you're into bands like Travis (similar sound), Radiohead, and (the lighter side of) The Verve, you'll definitely love Coldplay.  Standout tracks include &quot;Shiver&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, and &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; (a very uplifting, jazzy song if I might add!).  By the way, the music video for &quot;Yellow&quot; is probably the only video I've seen where the lead singer is walking on the beach singing in front of the camera the whole time!

The parody of certain Catholic beliefs makes for a wonderful spoof; but still gets you thinking about the scheme of God and His(Her) sense of humor.  I truly feel that God does have one and that He/She enjoyed this film as well.  If you haven't seen it, rent it then you will buy it!

0780631684|4.0|This movie has an interesting story and a few cool scary sequences. It is true that the actors are not all that good and that some twists in the scenario are... well... not so good either. Anyways, if you are looking for some thrills and don't mind about goofy stories, this one is for you. I recommend watching it with the sound cranked up a bit. The atmospheres in this flick are sometimes pretty damn creepy! Better than Scream? No way, but better than the rest of the slasher films, that's for sure. As a bonus, you have Sean W. Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) playing a goofy New Yorker sports fan. I like this guy!
B000000OTY|4.0|For me, this live album was recorded at the wrong time.  It showcases what was then Gabriel's latest studio album, 'Us', which is not widely regarded as his strongest, in musical terms.<br />So we get plenty of tracks from 'Us' and its predecessor, 'So', but no 'Biko' (an early concert favourite), and biggest sin of all, nothing from 'Security'.  I would love to hear how 'Rhythm of the Heat' or 'San Jacinto' sound in concert, but I guess they are to complicated to perform live with a small band.<br />The highlight for me of this album is 'Steam', which has a great intro, very unlike the studio version.<br />It is wonderful to read the other reviews of this album here, because the reviewers have clearly got more pleasure from it than  I have.  I'm determined to give it another hearing!
B00004U1EU|4.0|This film marks the rebirth of Julia Roberts. The casting agent picked a peach when they made this one. Julia is perfect opposite the lush Cameron Diaz who sparkles in her role as the naive bride-to-be. The movie has a heavenly sound track which brings many decade-or-so old classics back to life. Whilst the dialogue is laden with hilarious inserts from Rupert Everett who is the epitome of gay charm. As romantic comedies go this one is up there: one for the video rack- hey, buy the soundtrack too!
B00003CXE7|5.0|i thought the dvd quality was excellent along with all the extras such as extra and unseen footage. russell crowe and joaquin phoenix are great in there roles as well as the cinematography which was beautiful. the movie makes you take a second look at yourself as well as those around you. the fighting is superb and makes you quite educated by the time the movie ends. i recommend this movie highly.

0783228007|4.0|The movie starts a little slow, Clint's character seems tame at first (by his standards), but he picks it up quickly as he throws one of Robert Duvall's \\"hired hands\\" down a flight of stairs.  After that, it's Clint all the way as you know him!  He has some classic one-liners, which is entertainment in itself if you like the Eastwood style of westerns.

0790738139|5.0|Seeing this movie after Gladiator, it is easy to see where the choice of Russell Crow for that role was made.  Pugilistic, doesn't even come close to his character here.  Hit first, ask questions later!<br />This was a well done movie, each character was well developed.  You could see how they each clicked and interacted, who liked who, why and why not.  Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger and James Cromwell do a masterful job fleshing out their respective characters. The script they had to work with was excellent as well.<br />The action was fast and you had to pay attention and recall the situations and information you heard before.  One scene was a complete surprise to my fellow movie watchers, but did not surprise me, because I thought the line of questioning &amp; facts at hand peculiar and pointed to a certain end.  See if you will too.<br />This movie is set in the late 40s or early 50s, in L. A. and highlights the sordid actions on of the police department.  At that time, the mob had just lost a boss and there were quite a few things going on that the police force was called in for.  Not the least of which was as consultants for the movies.<br />You see three ways of dealing with police work.  One way through Guy Pearce's character (Ed Exley), who looks all moral high road, but explicitly for the purposes of advancing his career.  Then there is Kevin Spacey's character Jack Vincennes, that is the department's link to the Hollywood movie sets and the shoot em up gangster versus police movies of the time.  He's in it for the glamour and the payouts.  And then finally Russell Crowe's character who, is an avid wife-beater pursuer, but will do anything his boss tells him too.  Also he will think nothing about acting as judge and jury and executioner if he thinks it's justified.  Put these three together in one department where James Cromwell's character Dudley Smith is the chief of the department and there is bound to be an interesting time.  This chief knows how to use all of them to his ends, from his movie connections, his strong arm and the people he makes visible to the community.  It is amazing the balancing act that must be done.<br />If you like an involved drama that keeps you intrigued, this is it.<br />The physical violence is limited to shooting and fighting.  The sex scenes are implied, but one is somewhat violent.  The only nudity is at a distance and very brief. Due to the violence and the cops portrayed negatively, I would not recommend this movie for children..

6305949972|4.0|I would prefer to give this three and a half stars.<br />This is a beautiful movie and has been one of my favorites since I first saw it. Tim Burton is a genius, and knows how to bring out this dark, surrealistic beauty in all of his works. Burton's imagination of the lands where holidays come from (if you've not wondered, I'd say it's time you begun)  is brilliant, with Jack as the king of Halloween. I'm glad Burton didn't choose something tacky like Jack'o'Lantern, or Mr. Unlucky, or any of those typical named beings associated with Halloween. Creating a new being only added to the movie. A few of the lines are corny, and some of the delivery seems strange, but that happens in most movies.<br />As for the VHS, I found all the additional stuff they put on it to be silly. Save it for the DVD; I understand that they were trying to make that information to be more accessible, but I hate fast forwarding through the movie jsut to get to the interesting info. Most other movies save it for the DVD... they could have too.
B000002UAO|5.0|Kicking off with the funky Drive My Car, this album never lets up. With all songwriters firing on all cylinders, this is one of the most complete band performances of The Beatles' career. Lennon in particular shines here, the standout being In My Life, which is his musically and lyrically peak - although I didn't realise that George Martin speed up the solo until recently, which drive me crazy trying to play normally! Norwegian Wood, Nowhere Man, Girl and Run For Your Life are other great Lennon tracks. George puts in two great songs with If I Needed SOmeone and Think For yourself, while Paul's Drive My Car and I'm Looking Through You are fast and fun affairs. The only problem is the mixing of the channels of Drive My Car and Run For Your Life - if you listen to them with headphones its like splitting your brain in two. But first time Beatles listeners - this is the one to get for sure!

0684853523|4.0|I am decidedly not a Stephen King fan but a writer nonetheless.  I picked this book up as a whim and could not put it down for the following three days.  Behind a cavalcade of horror literature lies a sensitive man who knows his craft.  I found more helpful bits in the first section, his autobiography, than I have in any writing books of late.  Even for those not enthralled with the horror genre, pick this book up.  It's worth it.
B00000F1D3|4.0|At last a dance album that has intelligent lyrics for a change, unlike a lot of songs these days (Ricky Martin's &quot;She Bangs&quot;, for one). She has a strong powerful voice that doesn't get drowned out by the music. &quot;Believe&quot; was the first song that I had heard that used the vocoder, and unfortunately, now it seems that every artist and their brother are using it. I used to like it, I still do, but it can get a bit annoying after hearing it too often. But I really like this album, it's upbeat, and if it doesn't make you feel like dancing, then nothing will.
630280082X|5.0|Reviewers who complain that the story is trite are missing the point. This is a seemingly sincere attempt to pay homage to blues roots and show realistically, with greater sensitivity than I have seen elsewhere, the source of this music. If you have little interest in the blues, skip it.<br />Although it was contrived to please popular taste, the movie doesn't sell out its source material, and is brave enough to avoid an easy boy-gets-girl ending. In any honest movie about the blues, some pain is necessary; so it is, here. <br />After I happened to see this on late-night TV, it stayed with me for days afterward, and gave me an itch to revisit the South to see what I missed the first time around. A very worthy, intensely memorable, and deeply sincere movie, with a superb sound track.
B00003CXDV|4.0|I love this movie! As a trekker, I thought it was a halarious ode to Star Trek. I especially love the whole idea of the character of Guy Fleegman as the designated &quot;Red Shirt&quot;, destined to die before the first commercial. This movie is so witty and entertaining, a true delight!
