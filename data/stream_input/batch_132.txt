B00BGUMF9W|5|replaced my broken lift arm. not exactly the same hole pattern but useable.
B004NBEFXA|5|Easy install
B006HGA7VS|5|Awesome Jeep top with all parts and accessories to install. Makes the top easy zip on and off. Easily converts to a Bikini top in minutes.

B000V4YKLK|4|Fit just fine.
B00JGJG8VG|5|As the title says, it is a good product.
B000EQATEC|5|These new shocks stiffened and smoothed out the ride of my truck a lot after replacing the stock units which had 160,000 miles on them. Only time will tell how durable these ones are.
B0012P1QN2|5|replaced service port in my Camaro.  perfect.
B000L50ZVI|5|I have used zymol on my collector vehicle since I purchased it and I love it.  Easy to put on, easy to rub off and the shine and protection left behind are worth the price.  My vehicle is 21 years old and the finish still looks like it just left the showroom floor.
B00032KBFE|5|Just as expected
B00MXJELEC|5|Forget the wattage listings for these lights- they bear no connection with how much light they throw off- I was surprised how much light it threw off- while the beam is small, it is very bright.
B001BNASPM|1|The white around the star already came off.  Only put them in a month ago.
B000FW61SI|3|Works as advertised.
B00SO1YXY6|3|Not as sturdy as I expected.  A little too flimsy.
B0012X23NG|5|Worked just great. Adjustable height is great !!!!!
B002YK9GZY|5|Incredible sport look for your Lancer with an easy installation procedure
B00G23Y37U|5|Great deal
B003U2L9N2|1|Fits 2004 jeep grand Cherokee Laredo like a glove. However, the gap where the key slides in allows water into the fuel tank. This is going to the amazon landfill.
B00BCRMA9Y|5|These seat covers are just awesome. I bought them expecting their quality to be a bit off, but they are just so soft and comfortable. They look amazing and my dad really loved them. Would make an awesome gift for anyone who wants to improve their car. I would totally buy them again :)
B0012TWRBS|1|missing the hole for the 2nd ball. rediculous
B00AKEZ3VM|5|Product arrived quickly and was as described.
B00LAFE40Q|4|Direct replacement for the worn and broken springs in my girlfriend Malibu. Rides higher and better now.

B000BUQODG|5|Worked as expected. Good product
B00062YUUS|5|Works great for dwell and tach reading on late model cars.  Very easy to use and light weight.
B00E4CQGVW|3|thought lenses would be darker
B000T9LZDI|5|This stuff is GREAT !
B001NI7KE2|5|Very happy with the product.  Out GMC Acadia is sorely lacking in clothes hanging convenience, this took care of this problem.
B0031BHYZY|4|nice sounding deep exhaust
B00M78820I|5|My daughter and I both used our car shades today for the first time.  We were both pleased with our car shades. ”
B004SSAESS|1|After a month it started to disentigrate!
B0024NO6FG|5|Good quality easy install also fast shipping
B000766862|5|Only issue I had was my jack and cover . When reinstalled the bolt was not long enough.  Had to unscrew it from handle to make it longer.  Cant wait to put my gear in it. Cant even see it under the seat. Just wish it had not been so expensive.
B00JH2GMMC|5|Me and my brother both had our latches break on our 09 GMC Sierra center consoles. Body shop told us we would have to replace the whole console. I just couldn't believe that so I did some research and came across this latch. It took 10min to change. Fit was perfect and tight.
B00M2QMHK6|5|I needed a seat that allowed me to get up close to my bikes when am working on them.  Wanted comfort and the convenience of having the tools readily available.<br /><br />Well made.  Sturdy.  Wheels are hard plastic and rolls easy. Big tray to store parts and hand tools.  Seat is height adjustable and very comfortable. Am going to enjoy working on my bikes now...&igrave;n comfort.
B00HLW18T2|4|Super bright! Let's see how well they hold up.
B000CNAV1I|5|My all time favorite gasket sealer.

B0057DA90G|5|I have had it on for month or two...couple of car washes. Easy application ...durability.
B00651C8HG|5|Screwed right into the mount for the original wire antenna of my Ford Escape.  I like the macho &#34;stubby&#34; look and reception seems the same as the larger antenna it replaced.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Exactly what they promise.
B00SF3CB6A|4|Worked perfectly for the $20 charge.was very easy to install. Only problem is that it is slightly smaller than the original that's why I gave it 4 stars, If you can live with that then this is a very good buy
B000C8ZH5S|5|It works great with my 91 Nissan D21 pickup, 2 wheel drive, 4 cyls. Took me 20-30 mins to get it installed !
B0008G1NB6|4|Quick & Easy
B00029J3ZW|5|Good product keeps my motor cool and under 190°. Easy installation works perfect
B00606P1H0|5|Perfect fit & a lot cheaper than going to the dealer.
B00A4ABF8W|5|This stuff is great, I have a black 2015 Mustang and wanted to make sure this car is as clean looking as possible. This does a great job, not professional grade but for the price you can't beat it. I also washed and clayed my car before using this.<br /><br />It took me 5 hours to go through all three bottles but I was also taking my time. Also make sure you get more pads, about half way through the pad was saturated (I could have been using too much compound).<br /><br />Compound: make sure to do small sections, I was taking too big of a bite and it was hard to get everything off. I also tried to park my car in my garage at a diagonal and (like an idiot) brushed up against a few items and left some good scratches. This stuff got one scratch completely removed and you can no longer see it, however the other scratch I was not so lucky and there is a small chip (only touch up paint can fix that)<br /><br />Polish: Same with the ultimate compound make sure you do smaller sections as it can be hard to remove if left to dry (not as bad as the ultimate compound). After applying this I was just amazed that it made my new car look newer.<br /><br />Wax: This stuff was easy on easy off. After applying the wax it just sealed the deal and the car looked great. I was able to do alternate panels so that I wasn't just sitting around while the wax dried)<br /><br />I also did my motorcycle that had very obvious swirl marks from the previous owner and it really made an improvement.<br /><br />I have a ton of photos to share.
B0002SRH7O|3|Looks sort of nice. However, some of the tools have dented threats - I'll have to find a thin file and hope for the best.
B000EQR5YE|5|OEM replacement perfect fit
B001BFPPM6|5|fits and works
B00NC8UEY4|4|This bracket is not for a 20&#34; light which I knew upon purchase from reading the reviews.  Knowing that it was for a 22&#34; bar, I bought a 22&#34; bar to mount on it and everything fit perfectly.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have is that the brackets did not come with the foam protective pads.  I used neoprene washers to keep them from sitting directly on my paint ($0.48 from the hardware store).
B0093RRSXS|5|good
B00CIVKPT0|5|Literally two screws (difficult to get to, but not impossible) and one clip and I fixed the AC for $23 when the mechanic wanted $150.
B000C9TCFS|5|verry god
B00684TAYY|5|Easy to program
B0049MVBMG|5|Fit my 98 Pre Runner perfectly
B00EK5EECG|5|Work well, the fit is within a centimeter or an inch.
B0002Q7ZKK|5|Easy install.....works great
B004VR0H1A|5|easy to install and is looking good on our F150. great purchase. i wish this product wouldn't have included the plastic part only because I wouldn't have a way to remove the scratches.
B008N6AQXO|5|Awesome. Worked like a champ when I was steelhead fishing.
B00U15L3H8|5|For the price I can't complain. The alarm is LOUD! and the lock isn't going to be a onguard lock or a kryptonite lock of course, but for the money it is &#34;solid&#34; but the alarm is more of the reason why I brought it and not for the &#34;lock&#34;. I already have a very big onguard U-lock on my bike and have a seat that doubles as a u-lock on the way. This is just a extra last step of a deterrent.
B004D5Q296|5|Castrol Magnatec 5w20 oil with Mobil104 filter works great for my 2011 Hyundai Santafe Awd. I so alot of stop n go traffic, especially living in NYC, and whenever I do my oil change twice a year I notice that the oil is still pretty clean and clear when the mechanic drains out the oil. Engine is always smooth running too.
B00CH4GYQG|1|It did not fit the Peg Perego vehicle I had hoped it would fit.  Reading reviews made me think it would.
B00QJ81R72|5|Product worked exactly as described.  We were having a hard time finding a mirror to fit the windshield on our 180 Bayliner boat since the windshield has a rounded metal edge.  This mirror worked perfectly and did not require any drilling - it clamps over the top of the windshield.  Highly recommend this product to owners of Bayliner boats that have windshields with rounded metal edges.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Easy to install. Great value, Works better than expected.
B00QMWQK2M|2|not bad
B008B6R8SM|5|very cukis
B0017T7WHW|5|Love this product.  It is easy to use and works great
B00SLFHH5M|1|Product did not fit at all on my Subaru. Holes didn't even match up. So I will be returning this. And there even making me pay for shipping for the return.
B000NC0SA2|4|Good replacement product at fair price.
B000C9ODD4|5|Fuel pumps are not all that easy for me to install in a Chevy 350, and I do NOT like getting stranded in remote, wooded areas when a cheap aftermarket fuel pump goes out.  So, from now on, I will be using AC Delco fuel pumps -- I believe that they are the best quality fuel pump that I can buy, and I will Gladly pay a little more for the Reliability that I demand.  Also, the fuel line connections line up better with the fuel lines on the truck.  If they don't (aftermarket cheapie), you'll have to replace the Old, alcohol-hardened fuel lines before installing an aftermarket pump.  That makes a tough job even bigger.
B008FCCSD2|5|Excellent thank you<br /><br />I need front and back shocks if available
B00376B120|5|Just fine
B0002UHVAA|5|Ordered this after returning the mainstream store (WalMart, Fred Meyers, etc) Rhino version.  Returned the Rhino because it leaked instantly.  Yikes! Reason for the leak is the Rhino swivels inside the connector fittings and that is a BIG no-no in my book.  Last thing you want in a black tank connector is any possibility of leaking.  That will ruin your day real quick.<br /><br />The Valterra is a solid piece of heavy duty plastic.  No swiveling here.  Solid. Thick. Plastic. Much thicker than the Rhino.  The cleanout feature works amazingly as well.  Just bought a used RV and spent quite a while (probably 5 or 6) instances of running the cleanout after our first use.  Probably never done on my 2005 Terry before.  Now it looks clean as a whistle.<br /><br />This is a must have for any RV/TT that doesn't come with a black tank cleanout hookup.  Best $20 you'll spend on your RV.
B003CSL44S|5|Excellent fit and not bad looking.  I thought I would take them out after the snow cleared, but, they look good enough to leave in.
B00RCKN97W|5|Looks so nice good quality.
B000XFLTHA|1|After using them once, I have come to the opinion they are cheap and worthless. The belt buckle won't stay shut and the fall down.
B00N8L0WMO|1|It worked great for awhile. I really like the suction cups that help it stick to the windshield.  I also like that it's reversible.  The main problem is that the edges dry out and start to flack out.  It took we awhile to figure out where all the black crap was coming from. I realized it was the sunshade so I threw it away.
B00I5CRJ0Y|5|I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN TWO!  I just love this pattern.  It was super simple to apply and looks great on my Jeep!
B002AV7AXC|5|Work as expected. Good price.
B0090R5R70|5|excellent as described
B006P87216|5|Looks good on my vest
B00FXAA4WQ|5|excellent as described
B00HSFAR0S|1|This does not fit a 2013 Santa Fe sport. Bought in May and just tried to install today (August). Tried to return but was informed I'm past the 30 day return policy. Do not buy.
B002UC6XTI|5|Fast delivery. Product fit with little or no alterations in my 92 RV
B0071B61XG|5|Fit was great half price over parts stores.
B007NQ38HG|5|Thank
B00UB3CV7G|5|Great gift
B00KB507J8|5|Great buy exactly as pictured fast delivery. 5*****
B00TGAG6GM|5|Really nice decal. Works perfect on the hood of a wrangler. Great easy follow instructions so that you don't get any air bubbles or mess it up
B0009SQQ1A|5|Was exactly what I wanted
B00X1P99ZI|1|Clutch lever was correct one, brake lever was not. Decent quality, about what you would expect for the price.
B00CGTVCIC|5|Really like the feel. Had to get on but great once it's on.
B009DJXQIC|5|[WAS WELL PLEASED
B00NLMRTB2|5|Everything we expected, as seller description. Prompt service. Very pleased.
B00GN0V8W0|5|Great item. Does what it says!!
B00OOOV566|5|Fast shipping and fit and work better than the originals.<br />You will need a special &#34;star&#34; bit to remove the original Chrysler bolts.<br />You can get those &#34;star&#34; bits at Harbor Freight for cheap.<br />You also might need some help holding up the hatch while you put the new ones on, or use a long 2x4 to prop it open.<br />I would recommend these, from this company, to anyone!<br />WTG Partsam!!
B00BY5GF3Q|4|Good quality. Only time will tell its durability.
B002BHYT8Y|4|As Expected.
B0087GRB1K|4|Easily installed . Looks good. Seriously lowers exhaust Back Pressure. Obvious result is a bit more HP
B00N9LMXUC|5|My car sits in the direct sun all day long while I'm at work and this shade is exactly what I was looking for. The Jumbo size fits my CR-V great and I just have to put the visors down to keep it in place. Fills up the whole front window nicely and keeps the interior cool. Great price and quality product.
B0002SRH60|5|Works perfectly, very well made, just wish the threaded bolt was longer
B004PZG7LC|5|I got this item for the Jeep. The seat covers are really a good fit. The design of this item is really good. They have left those small elastic pockets so that the material does not tear while installing. They really look fantastic too once you install them. The item comes with the 2 sets of covers each for the driver & passenger seats. They also have the covers for the headrest.    The only downside like some may have already explained here is the pain in installing them. Especially the front driver & passenger seat covers when you have to push the covers through the seat so as to pull them on the other side & attach to the velcro strap behind the seat. You'll have to remove the headrests on the front driver & passenger before installing them.   I tried the &#34;sliding the plastic bag idea&#34;. It didnt quite work for me. This is what i would suggest. Get an unusable CD / DVD & instead of pushing your fingers through, place the cd right between the velcro strap & slowly increase the force pushing it. The cover would come out from behind the seat. Be careful though not to apply too much force. Bend the seat a little too while installing. That would help.   Once the cover slides from behind, if you cannot pull it with your fingers, try & pull it gently it with pliers / tongs. Pull the cover tightly from behind the seat so that it sticks firmly to the velcro strap. The covers also have these buckle clips which go under the seat & attach from the behind so that its a rigid fit. They also have these hooks that can clip to the metal part under your seat.   I also got the rear seat covers for which i have written the review under Item # 13264.53
B00SBZRKEU|5|Yes it works very well<br /><br />But it would be nice to have a hard case to put in after use
B0002NUO5Q|3|Good product but fades in sun.
B00P2R5W36|5|ok
B0071HE2SQ|5|I love it
B00RY9WWWY|5|They are great do their job
B000CO7DZ4|5|great qualilty
B004GBJAOG|4|Tool looks to be good value but I have yet to use it
B004804N7E|4|It is what it is... no big deal.
B002R0KXMQ|5|Perfect match and fit for Jeep Liberty 2005. Son came over and installed in 5 minutes.
B00KY8LRH8|3|Not bad
B008SDK89O|3|It works, but the flap on the end that is supposed to extend its height and length doesn't really stay in place if you try to use it, and it didn't seem to come with all of the installation hardware or screw holes one might need to make it more permanent. That said, we do use it. For basic applications that don't require the extender, it should be fine.
B00HVKGITE|5|Takes a little bit to get used too.  To put the helmet on, the chin guard must be off.  Once the lid is on connecting the chin guard takes some effort.  After some practice it installs with ease.  Loads of air flow through the helmet when at speed, somewhat noisy though, but I wear ear plugs all the time so no problem.  The sun guard lever is hard to find when riding.  T
B00IBOLOMA|5|Very good. Fit me 2015 Fusion perfectly<br />Hook to stops exactly.
B0056VL9Z8|1|Would have given no stars but package did arrive; so that rates one star I guess. I have a 00 mustang and part didn't even come close to fitting. The headlight wholes are not as pictures. Just wrong part all the way around. Not even sure part went on mustang period.
B002G2261G|3|Being the guy who waxes the 5 cars in the family I'm always looking for a better more efficient method. These microfiber bonnets looked like a good idea for removing the wax after the application. Using a paste carnauba wax I found that the bonnet filled up with the wax residue rather quickly. The wax in the bonnet was also getting hard due to the friction. The package indicates you should use a brush to remove the wax after each panel, but that didn't work for me. I instead used a microfiber towel which I could turn frequently to remove the wax and then tried the second bonnet just to polish after the wax was removed. Haven't noticed any swirl marks and it looks good. I just don't know how much extra shine was attributed the blue bonnet. Probably would work better for apply the wax, but I don't see that as a real benefit. The packaging recommends microfiber for buffing, removing wax, polishing &finishing. I would be afraid to use this for buffing for fear of burning the paint. A foam pad would seem safer.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Better than others and the best price around! They LOOK great, and fit great! Don't slide either.
B00KTIUG5C|4|worked the way their were supposed to
B00FC221BC|1|First set lasted 40 days, second set lasted less than that, It looks like i have to stay with the old yellow stock lights since both sets lasted through the short warranty period
B0002NYBC8|1|product leaked out faster then the 134a. I even replaced all the &#34;o&#34; rings, compressor, orifice tube and compressor. Don't fall for this product like I did, 30 some dollars up in the air .
B00QKR2HQM|5|It is awesome!
B000EQ6IAG|4|Great stopping power, only downside is there is A LOT of brake dust. If your wheels are black, or you don't care what they look like, then it won't matter. If you want them to always look clean... good luck. Personally, I drive in a lot of rush hour traffic, which calls for aggressive driving, and I'm glad to be using these brakes cause I'm pretty sure I'd have rear-ended somebody by now without them. (Note: I have EBC Greenstuff on the front and back and put all 4 on at the same time so I can't say for sure what these alone would do, with the other set being a standard set.)
B000EDOST2|2|Not what I was expecting. Should have read description more carefully. Stakes are difficult to drive into dry, rocky soil. Hard to get the strap over the awning unless you're tall. Scraping this and getting ratcheting straps.
B007ZXXSHW|5|great stuff
B000TYVU1U|5|worked ok so far
B000XSGL48|5|great dry lube for mt bike
B006IV6CAW|5|Nice and loud
B000O5DUP8|5|great item:  had ithe lights intstalled on a cargo carrier.
B004O1YSWM|5|Great
B000CAINEI|5|Love it.  Bought two for this horribly hot summer in Portland. Works like a charm.
B001N729FS|5|I've bought 3 of these cutoffs over the past year for various cars and they all work great and are easy to install.  Very pleased.
B0091Q3NCG|5|excellent as described
B00FGKGI2I|5|Smells just like a new car. Most other scents smell cheap, I was skeptical, but this really captures that fresh paint/adhesive/new leather/molding smell of a new car. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00JNL68Y4|5|handy
B00DSR49FE|5|Great
B002303NW2|5|great product... I wish they wouldn't shift at speed,,, need a better anchor system... but I love them ....
B00NEJSYEI|5|Same quality as the floormats that came with my car.Only problem it did not fit my 2011 Cruze LT built on 1/2011. The holes where the clips go in are not compatible so they don't lock into place. I ordered SKU 95021072 instead as I suspect this is the correct fit.  *Update* SKU 95021072 Fits my 2011 Cruze LT built in Jan. 2011
B009DK3OII|3|This was a very cheap replacement part but you get what you pay for.  I ended up returning this and buying a OEM replacement from Lexus.
B00EKKDKHG|1|Really wasn't satisfied
B00RFCDN6O|4|works just fine
B00M0YRYQM|5|Love the shirt for when I ride my quad
B002IVEPLY|5|Perfect fit
B002R1DI8G|5|These headlights saved me the time and money of having to try the 3M headlight restore kit. They look as good as new OEM lights. GREAT DEAL! 👍
B00757KJTI|5|looks great - works good.
B0049W2VDO|4|Fits my 2013 Polaris RZR 800 just right. Instruction are not user-friendly , and sometimes it is hard to understand what exactly is required to be done for the assembly. The adjuster increases the driver's seat height by about 2&#34;.
B004C6OBBC|5|It's a pin, what can I say
B00008RW9V|4|worth every penny
B00LHQ2WOS|3|Nice pad really liked it. Didn't stick more then a week.
B00HTP8N0I|4|Product arrived quickly and was as described. A little lighter duty than I had hoped.
B005TD0X96|5|I used this on my motorcycle exhaust and it worked better than I thought it would no more leg burns great product so far there's no fadeing like outher brands do so I would recamend this to everyone.
B0073MG1QU|5|I am glad I found this radiator on sale.  It really beats the plastic tank versions - so far.  It has larger coolant passages so that even being a single-row radiator, it does a great job keeping the old '95 YJ cool even in the crazy Texas summer heat.  It also looks very nice under the hood too, kinda' custom look.  Everything bolted straight up, no having to slot holes to make up for poor workmanship at the factory.
B0075CUJWU|5|After much, much  research I decided on the WIX filter for the WRX.  Subaru a few years back used OEM filters made in Japan that are black in color. These black filter have a great reputation unfortunately almost totally unavailable in the USA now, Subaru then awarded the new OEM filter USA contract to Fram The new Fram made OEM filter is Blue in color..  Subaru has a specific &#34; high&#34; bypass pressure relief valve. The only filters made as of today that meet that exact spec are the Japan black OEM, the Blue (Fram Made) OEM and the Wix filter. If you do your research ALL fram filters ( including the new Fram made blue OEM)  have a bypass valve at the bottom of the filter. This will allow contaminants to wash down the outside of the filter and back into the engine when the bypass valve is open. The WIX filter has a patented bypass valve at the top or the entrance of the filter. When the WIX filter is in bypass the oil is never contaminated like in a Fram made filter.  Wix is now a global company but got its start in Gastonia NC, USA  in 1939 and still has operations and manufacturing in Gastonia as well as all over the world. Why trust your car to anything less than a quality WIX filter made in the USA with the correct valve spec and does not contaminate your oil when in bypass like the new Blue OEM filters.  Shame on Subaru for not using WIX as the new OEM supplier.
B001NOU92G|3|Bought this for spraying Zolatone inside a boat.  Clogged up pretty bad.  Maybe if I would have ran the Zolatone through a strainer or took the little filter screen in the gun out sooner, it might have worked. It was the only gun I could find with a big enough tip for the thicker Zolatone paint.
B0011YTZAU|5|PURCHASED FOR A FRIEND
B002WP362U|5|Works Great
B001O7F83C|5|car runs like a champ after changing to these wires
B00LVAIDES|5|Manufacturer's exact replacement with 5 year life.
B00KQEH2P6|5|Another EXCELLENT value for a dexos approved engine oil. Buy this 12 pack and you should covered for a year. On par with the Valvoline synpower engine oil line.
B00029KA68|5|Fits like a glove!!!
B008DKRKWU|5|i would like to say thinks to the seller<br />and the adapters work with me
B00LUPOSD4|5|Nice
B00CASDZKC|5|Great mats! Tried another before these and it didn't have full seat coverage. Paid a few extra dollars after reading these reviews and found it all to be true. Fits perfectly, install in less than a minute (on a 2015 Honda CRV), and even looks like a quality mat. Highly recommend for those with toddlers!!
B00KFO6DNE|3|Not very flexible, other than that it was ok. I strongly advise you put a daub of superglue under the crown cap.
B000IE0HF6|5|Make be feel a little safer.
B005BNYY26|5|Great - thanks..
B00EA0ZB7I|2|If buying these lights I suggest trying them out as soon as possible I waited until the return  date was passed and one don't work but the one that does work is bright
B002VX31UK|5|Perfect fit, and easy to install.  Everything I needed was included in the package.
B0057A9HES|5|Solid constructioon; straightforward design.  Frees up the front and back of the engine while keeping pan off the floor.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Works great.
B00YRHWZ5K|3|Seems to do the job but gives an annoying chirp usually when I turn off the ignition on our 2016 HR-V. Have this installed in the center rear cup holder which took a little creativity since the horizontal outlet leaves very little clearance over this device.some device ports will be blocked when installing this in that particular spot of that specific model car. I rotated this so that the outlet plug blocks the device's daughter car outlet port  and to provide a corner in the cup holder for the power cable to be routed up to relieve strain.
B005CS5KMI|5|Excellent, we'll buy from them again.
B00KZPN6UQ|1|Worked great first day.  Very accurate.  Day 2,  read only zero.  Tried several times to re-boot. Will be returning.
B00EAM6HEC|5|Wonderful sets of horns already got them set up for early christmas presents.
B0094JZSR8|1|Inaccurate for one, a little too short for reaching inside dual, needle stopped holding the reading in a day or two. I don't know, maybe mine was manufactured on a Friday 5 mins before quitting time.
B002GTK8K0|1|Good quality and easy to install but the bolts were pictured with a hex system but came with a Phillips system instead which I could not tighten enough to stay in making them essentially useless . If they came as pictured I would have rated them as &#34;Five Stars&#34; . Very misleading.
B00029XGAU|2|Not any louder than a stock horn. Not worth the time it took to wire.
B00GFWMAZK|5|Had a vacuum leak from the seal in my disa valve also had a failed disa valve :O after rebuilding it with this kit I no longer have a vacuum leak and my car is much more responsive!
B008RJVW9Y|4|Use it on my terrace divider, had protected facial gear on to protect myself but it was easy to use.
B00KLSZ632|4|Very nice and easy to install.
B00267PZUK|5|this tool is worth every penny of the price, it worked perfectly and quickly.<br />when I broke three plugs on my 06 f150 I was freaking out, I didn't know what I was going to do, then I found this tool online<br />the first plug I removed with this tool was a little unsettling with all the crunching sounds but it came right out.<br />the next two went alot quicker with more confidence.<br />just take the advice of other reviewers and use plenty of oil and anti sease
B00B3XUBES|5|Arrived as advertised
B0048EBE0O|5|Love this. Makes it cooler in the car after it has been sitting in the sun all day.
B0009NWQWI|5|Worked great on a 2 weeks, 2000 miles trip through the mountains and at 80 on the highways. Kept the suitcases dry through a couple bouts of heavy rain. The extra room allowed us to bring a couple more things with us AND give the kids more legroom, win-win! If anyone is interested you can fit 4x [[ASIN:B00MW1STB2 American Tourister Splash 2 Upright 25]] in this as long as you don't fill them to the point where you have to use the expansion zipper on any of the suitcases. We did wash the van twice to make sure that the dust and grit didn't damage the paint, but otherwise it required no special attention.
B00NEL6HT0|5|the fit for my 2014 prius is perfect
B000E283SA|5|These work great but so do the cheap ones from the parts store. Check first.
B001V9V1WA|5|Fast shipping and great product 5 stars all the way.
B00AR379U4|5|This carb came ready to use right out of the package. Simply bolt on and its good. I reccommend that u buy an air filter at the time u buy the carb so you dont do damage by getting dirt sucked into it. Well worth the price!
B00G6RLTKG|5|It's a must for us who use the Camelooiler. Only the original oil works for my oiler
B000CH14WO|4|Seriously a pain in the ass to put it considering you have to remove the old bushings (i burned them out) and then thoroughly clean inside where the new ones go. But after installed i will have to say the front end feels alot more solid and stable over the bumps.
B001AWLJG6|5|This is a great product, which I use to store my bike upright in a tight garage.  The components are high quality and sturdy. The bike feels very safe in the stand.  This should be a no brainer for anyone looking for such a stand.
B00XLT5ICC|5|I bought this for my laptop and It got the job done I would highly recommend this to a fellow Hydra agent.
B004PL63Z6|5|Great quality product. I purchased this item mainly for the security that the ball can't be removed by someone looking to steal boat trailers. I also like that it had the added drop length which gives you a more level tow.
B00MIZT7OK|5|i bought three! i gave the other two to my mom and sister.. it's really cute, i love cats! and that's not all, it's a small weapon too. at least i can carry it with me all the time unlike other sharp objects... i just love it! :)
B000CSRA26|1|Had these on a couple of previous vehicles and loved it. I put it against it, without sticking it on, and looked good. Went ahead and stuck it on and still looked good. Got in and cracked the windows an inch and took a look from the outside. Disappointed! You could pretty much stick your fingers in it without having to bend your fingers. Which ment rain could EASILY get in there. Brought the windows up half an inch and STILL disappointed and rain could still get in. From the windows being closed, I ended up just barely tapping the windows down and took a look outside. The back windows and the top half of the front windows were Ok but the front part, where it slopes down, still looks like rain can still get in it.<br />I looked at the instructions and pictures of how it was to be installed after all that. I DID IT EXACTLY HOW I WAS SUPPOSED TO AND SAME OUTCOME... DISAPPOINTED! Made sure the product fit my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee again, Jeep 05-10 Grand Cherokee . DISAPPOINTED! Now stuck on my jeep and getting in contact with manufacturer.
B00MY5BYFE|3|Good products but the clips are not included !!!!! I've never seen that before ! So I'm obliged to reuse the formers which I'm not supposed to do .
B0045MITCU|4|Fits the filter for a 2012 RZR 800 - looks good, fit snug, perfect.
B00C53K3XO|5|all that it was advertised to be, only took seconds to program it for operation. Thanks for simplicity
B00TTLR8W4|5|You want Soap? You got Soap. !! Man...This stuff is Soapier than any Soap I ever Soaped anything with!!! lol
B00KMR3GT8|1|Mine did not last very long..bulbs started to burn out..water got inside....not very good for the money
B008MCGC7S|3|Plug didn't match
B0004ELKC4|5|Used on the vinyl part of my Fleetwood folding camper. Love this stuff and a little goes a long way.
B00RBQ6HS0|5|Great Product, easy to install, and I can't believe how bright they are.....Keep in mind you will need to provide you own length of wire and switch to complete the installation. Great buy
B001EAQTRI|4|I'd say it got rid of about 70% of the noise that came over the audio line I was having trouble with.
B0002UEOLO|5|Great price and great to use when servicing your engine.
B00RH3AMIS|4|Haven't used them yet. But look like any quality strap I've ever seen
B0085FOZUI|4|This looks great on my car! I even had it painted and its durable.
B00FXEQALQ|5|Looks great
B00K0VMXDQ|2|Returned.  Couldn't  start up my Lexus with a dead battery.  Car tried to turn over but died right away. Had to buy a one of those chargers the size of a regular car battery and that worked without a problem
B00RE8IM42|5|Install these on my 2002 Miata. Superior to the HID bulbs I installed on my Nissan frontier two years ago. Like them so well on the low beams I purchased a second set for the high beams.
B00KWGU71Y|5|Fits snugly in the received without any &#34;sneaking out&#34;. It can be a little hard to get back out, but the piece of mind that it will stay in is worth it. It also does a great job of keeping dust and water out of the receiver.
B000KPU8F2|4|Only needed it once and worked great but haven't needed to use it on my double battery diesel to check of it has the cranking amps to start it
B0001EX1VU|4|Great price and value.  They make a HUGE difference!!
B00IIHKPA2|5|I would recommend this 10 times over. This is polyurethane construction, tough as nails.  My wife has run this into the curbs three times and it bends back to shape. The paint falls off so you might have to get professional painting or just don't run into curbs. Better than fiber glass because one hit and that's gone, this one works great. I purchased some smaller nuts and bolts to install it rather than using the screws that came with it. It looks awesome.
B002ZS4QCS|4|Not as strong as expected. Stick out too far from back of seat but bendable. Might be better options out there.
B000KKLLX0|5|Works great.
B002MTTO72|5|convenient size and good value
B00CJ69BXA|5|Great pads.
B00E3BQRBI|2|Looked nice in the pictures but upon arrival the casting on every single one was pitted. Would not recommend to anyone I know or repurchase.
B0085CG8ZQ|5|Easy, quick and perfect fit.  Smooth transaction.
B00MB88NYY|5|Works perfect half the price of oem
B0027QWNGO|3|I bought this trash keep because Im crazy about the cleanliness of my car. I saw this product and like that it look like a &#34;non trash&#34; looking trash keeper. The space to place your trash is a bit small. I placed one cup and a couple of crumple papers and it was filled. I still use it to keep stuff and use the bottom zipper compartment to hold wipes and such. I would recommend if it was a bit bigger.
B005E9ZZUW|5|Fit was perfect easy install with new ball joints
B0081SBJVC|5|Perfect fit on my 250 efi 3.0. Charging up great now
B0006IX7WY|5|clean and simple, does a nice job holding things together.
B00G8OIVPI|3|The finish and welds are good. Slightly louder than stock with a small amount of &#34;rasping&#34;. The throttle response is better (quicker rev's) The install was difficult due to the stock exhaust bolts were rusted and broke when I removed them. The Depo pipe may lightly touch the front cross member or trans. causing a small amount of vibration due to the rubbing. The best advise I can give is take your time (about 2-3 hours)......just take your time on the install.
B00537FIRU|5|Great price, just had it installed in my 2011 explore. 👍👍👍
B000JIND4S|5|My car doesn't have the most modern up to date  security system installed but ever since I bought this club I can sleep a lot better at night knowing my car (94 Integra )won't be jacked and helps deter would be thieves. Simply just hook around the brake and the other around the steering wheel when it's lowered all the way down and lock the club in and done. You get 2 keys for this thing so don't lose them. I keep one on my key chain and the other I keep at home in a safe place. If I had another car I definitely would buy another one.
B00Q2PB024|5|Easy to install and I really love the look it gives my truck
B001FLOP0Y|5|Perfect fit for our '98 Camry!!!  Definitely did the trick.  Car starts every time now and runs smoothly!!
B00V93AJEE|5|I love them they stand out great buy 👍
B00LW8VWHO|5|Worked just like it should . Shipping took about a week and that was OK with me . Generator is running like new now . The fuel connector was not the same but a  small bend in the fuel line allowed it to work fine . I just ordered an air filter so you may need that also .
B002UC8MJW|5|Works great. Good quality
B0016IMFEO|5|Great product
B00X96V0JM|4|Looks great but sound is low
B0091XT102|4|VThis Light bar is amazing. i thought it was going to be horrible and fall apart and not work but this light bar has 7 different patterns and each one is unique. this is great for day or night time and it has 360 degree lighting. i have nothing bad to say about this product.
B004J0YS00|4|It works and fit
B00CQH6J64|3|Picture makes you think you are getting a jet kit but it is only one size jet.
B001892VAE|5|I use this to fit all three windows from my JK unlimited soft top. Seems to work just fine!
B0009IQZFM|5|Meguiar's X2000 Water Magnet Microfiber  Drying Cloth was excellent , It really hold a lot of water  and it doesn't streak. Its now my go to cloth for my car.
B0041P8YM6|5|A little challenging to install, but looks great.
B0022ZN6WU|5|Fit the Arrow Shadow Honda perfectly, like it was made for it, love it.
B005DKIIJW|5|My 2nd one, love them!
B0009H523Y|5|Fram is the only product i will use on my cars.They work great.
B00N4WIAE4|5|Works as designed. Must wear premium breathing apparatus and use in a WELL ventilated area. Best to leave overnight for curing.
B00KHA1EQC|4|The roof came in but the mounting hardware sent was for a different model. I contacted Massimo directly and they were very pleasant and responsive. They shipped the new hardware right away and the installation went great
B00BYH6C1E|5|These work.  When I turned in my leased auto I forgot to take them out.  No bother in getting another set.  They do the job.
B00KHA15XE|4|The windshield arrived but with the newer mounting hardware. I contacted Massimo directly and they shipped the correct hardware immediately.
B000F5DQWY|5|Arrived on time and was easy to install, sounds great.  Not what you expect to hear from Prius C
B00EK5F0NS|5|Fit just right
B005MZXUZ0|5|Excellent
B00DE95XXS|2|very thick and did not properly fit in license plate holder
B00NJ3KYGU|5|I bought these to match the color of the LED headlamps on my 2015 F150 King Ranch.  They look great.  I can't say how bright they are as of yet but I didn't buy them for additional brightness.
B000EDDQEU|5|I'm glad I bought this battery. It's small and lightweight, but still has enough power to start my car's engine. Just a side note, you may need to buy a terminal kit to fit your car's battery cables. I had to buy a top-post terminal kit for mine.
B000NWA8HU|5|Much cheaper and easier than going to a dealer.  Replaced due to the dash lights fading in and out. Fixed the problem easily with this.
B001UGJPXQ|5|Great
B003G9G4X4|5|Get what you expect.
B003QU3HW4|5|Perfect! the product shipped on time and arrived in excellent condition. It is soft under your feet which is nice cause we leave are shoes outside of the camper, so having a soft rug when coming out is nice.
B00NSV85PK|2|Look nice but will blow off of your vehicle. I purchased to and they both blew off the second day I used them.
B00CFCHSO2|2|sent it back did not match color in car
B00V361LXA|1|The part was not made well.  The connection for the motor was lose.  This allowed the unit not to function as it should.  Returned
B0009IBJE4|5|My hubby loves this and says it will come in handy in the winter to come.
B00CSWEJZU|3|Honestly, nothing great about it, feels like my towel does the same job as this.
B009PIO4AK|5|I have the 2015 Camry Hybrid SE - and this mat fits perfectly! I am so happy with it. It covers the bottom of the trunk, not the walls / deep back. It matches the floor matsfor the seats. Hopefully it will last, but so far, so great! Love them!
B00F8TB29G|1|Gave this 5 Stars back on August 9, 2015 when I bought it. It is now rusted beyond belief. It said that it was stainless steel and had a 10 yr warranty.  Not cool!  I am now looking for a quality replacement.
B00I8J42S6|5|Worked perfect on a 1991 R3500 with 4L80E transmission filter and gasket made in Taiwan and seems to be of good quality. Also comes with the grommet to hold the filter in the transmission would buy again for the price.
B0040DUCGA|5|Nice
B004HAEFMI|5|Great
B0010AN0SI|5|Exact replacement, fast delivery.
B00F4MUYN2|5|I purchased this vest for my son as a gift.  When it arrived at his address on time he could not believe the quality of the leather vest and it's great design. I got a call from him says how happy he was with my gift to him and it fit perfect. I read the reviews and purchased a size larger than his normal size. He was pleased that he could wear a hooded sweatshirt under it and be comfortable. Then he went on about how great it was that it had a cell phone pocket on the inside. I give this item 5 stars
B001AVSIOI|5|Keep the lock well lubricated.  I didn't and it froze up during the winter with all the salt we have here.  and I had to cut it off. This happens to all locks in my experience so I can't fault the lock.  It didn't rust like other locks I've used.
B00A0GIJHA|5|Perfect fit, and made of quality material. Immediately smelled better in the cabin of our van.
B00L1S0JU6|5|I'm going buy one of these every other time I order off of amazon so that I get a collection because they work so well. They're easier on the finish than a chamois and absorbs a lot of moisture. Its a detailer's must have and DIYer pro-tip tool. 5/5 for sure
B006H1BWTO|5|I purchased these to mount my LED's.  They arrived quicker than expected, look great and installed easily.
B000XJRYQ6|5|My husband and I recently adopted two kittens and have chosen not to de-claw them. After three months of scratches, tears, and missing leather, we had come to the conclusion we would have to replace our two leather sofas in order to have decent looking furniture. After doing some research, we decided to try the liquid leather pen I hopes of not needing to spend money to replace the furniture or have it reupholstered. We now HIGHLY recommend to anyone looking for a cheap fix! The brown color blended perfectly with our couches, and they look like new! granted, it did take 2.5 hours of painting over the scratch and buffing the excess off, but the end result was well worth it. I'll spend a Saturday doing this rather than purchase new furniture any day! We are definitely keeping a pile of this product for future use!
B0050M85ZA|1|This shirt was at least 2 sizes too small.  I couldn't believe it.  Plus there was no instructions on how to return this shirt.  I wear 3XL, and the two sides didn't even meet to where I could button the shirt.  I was extremely disappointed.  HOW CAN I RETURN IT!!!
B00651CLCS|5|Great product
B00BV1WVMW|5|this paddle works great without breaking the bank, the tip has what seems to be a reinforced coating to aid in preserving the paddle while using to push off of rocks or stream beds and it is comfortable in the hands to use.  I wish it could get me more time in my local creeks
B003FBV8ZW|5|excellent as described
B00L1XI69W|5|bought as a gift
B00KC8OLYQ|5|Worked perfect and was easy to install if you look up the procedure on YouTube.
B00474A1M2|4|Worked as expected
B000H7CJAK|1|Not a good deal after you have to go out and buy acid shop carefully
B008D2ICAC|5|Worked great.  :)
B003BGPBG8|4|A little pricey for what you get, but there was a noticeable performance improvement...
B001FFY334|5|It fits like it should and functions properly.
B0009IQZPW|5|good product
B00MIHIYVA|5|Everything about this is great. Well worth the money.
B00TGCHEAM|4|One of the bolts wouldn't thread in
B00C2NRQUK|5|Perfect fit for my 1997 dodge dakota V8 magnum. My mechanic installed in about 15 minutes by the time it was all adjusted. Very good quality belt and good price.
B001KSAB7I|5|Very easy to put on. Works and looks great.
B005MYPUXG|5|Exactly what I was expecting.
B00MGSC2IW|5|I replaced both filters today on my 2014 Ram 2500 cummins, and saved over $100 + tax by doing it myself.<br />If this is the first change of the filters then be warned, the factory has a habit of not lubing the O-rings, making removal a real struggle. The engine bay filter is hard to get to, so make sure you have a socket extension. The rear filter near the tank is also difficult to get to on a 4x4, much easier than the engine bay filter, but be prepared to struggle.<br />I have a 4 post lift which made the read filter easier to get to. At 6' even I had to use a step stool to get the engine filter out, it is buried down there for sure.
B003YYMM1E|5|Very easy to apply. Looks great on my car.
B0075YX9WK|5|very good service from Volar Motorsport inc
B00KB8BREO|5|great product,thanks.
B007JEK0B4|4|If i can figure how to get to lnstall it l am sure it will do the trick.
B00BR5L3QC|5|I received this helmet from my fianc&eacute; on my birthday and was very pleased with it. I have a size medium and yes it's a little tight but broke in just fine and I like my helmet to stay on my head not wobble so that didn't bother me. I'm writing this review because I was just in an accident with this helmet on. Best 50 ever spent it helped save my life. No damage other then some scratches. When my head hit the ground honestly felt like I laid it on a pillow great helmet. Just wish I could get my hands on another medium one. Hard to find one though. Thanks iv2 for that you get 5 stars and I stand behind your product.
B00QBV4ATO|4|Too short but it still works. The holes for the arms are cut a little too small.
B000NUT3NM|5|Excellent product and service
B00G620ZVU|5|Product arrived quickly and was as described.
B000CB0KJ8|5|work great
B00LMOIPDC|4|I like it
B001WUT1UM|5|I read many of the bad reviews and decided to take a chance anyways since they were the only ones I could find like this. I'm glad I took the chance since they seem of better quality than what I expected after reading them. They look like they will last and actually covers my entire seat!
B003NOD4VW|1|Order arrived without the keys as pictured.
B001C64BMO|5|Got an 09 Chrysler Sebring touring fit perfect no problems n half price of local auto stores
B00A6Y9X5S|4|it is what i needed and at a reasonable price
B000B7RCLM|5|Purchased to replace the spark plug in my snowblower.  Immediately upon removing it from the packaging, I adjusted the gap, and installed it in the snowblower.  Fired right up!  Works like a champ!  I'm a happy customer.
B00HYHWSO8|5|Perfect fit for explorer 2013. No smell. Delivered in time.
B00SDX4JPI|4|Works well but does get dirty pretty fast for me.  I love the feel and the superhero/comic book theme.  I just wish the colors were a bit more adult, subtle, muted.  Also, the design should have been put at an angle so the image is different all the way around.  Right now there are a number of heroes you can see, and a number that you never get to see because they end up on the back.  If the fabric was cut at an angle instead of straight that would not be an issue.<br /><br />It works wonderfully and was not too hard to put on.
B00KHUQAY8|4|Good
B00J262R9A|5|Outstanding
B00DWVN08I|5|Fits perfect on my 2&#34; hitch... Who doesn't like bragging they own a Toyota and it isn't flashy on my truck.
B001GG05ZM|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE
B0014E3MSS|5|Old ones were hard,stiff, and cracked, bought two, no more leaks easy to install, flexible, great quality, best price on the net, fast shipping
B004EDF8HY|5|made my hyperflashing on my LED turn signals go away! tip to people who install this, you have to push the clips on really tight to make sure it splice. I spliced it multiple times and it didn't work, and I thought I had a broken resistor, but turns out I was just not pushing it hard enough. and to answer some other questions other buyers may  have, yes they're removable (your wires would just be a bit bent, use some pliers and a really really skinny flathead), and if you have front LED turn signals, you can install them in the rear turn signals (even if they don't have LED), and they still work.
B006E4SKQ2|5|fits my 2010 honda lx coupe perfect and looks great, goes perfect with the gray and black theme i got going inside the car
B001AZ38O4|4|This kit had *almost* everything necessary to do the brakes on my 1998 Toyota Sienna.  It lacked only two very thin washers, which I just reused.  Everything fit perfectly and was in good shape - nothing bent or rusty.
B00UM58RUI|5|Great value for a bike helmet. Not for street use or motor sports.
B001KPCG7E|5|Great - thanks..
B007MUY8U4|5|Lips worth great Ottomans wore out everything is doing great.
B004GCHM4K|5|Work perfectly
B00199LQNQ|4|they work
B00IAJ99IC|5|Easy to install and better than advertised! Green is perfect for this year because the cup holder and display are also green!
B00ZCE2Z5W|2|Easy installation but the car charger fuse burnt and the out let to plug into the music box had to power going to it. So I had to to buy another power cord
B00TMFR0HA|5|Bright at night - works great!  Excellent purchase!
B00VH643H2|5|My husband has a habit of grabbing up my dish towels and washcloths to use for other things than dishes and bathing so I decided to get him some of these before I end up choking him. He and my daughter got a laugh at out of it! I personally have used these - had to wash his car to do it too.  HmmpH. I simply tossed the dirty ones into an old small wastebasket in the garage until I had a load that I could throw in the washer. They washed up well and can be reused over and over again. They are made of cotton as are most towels because it really soaks up the moisture the fastest. They are a great size for many things and not just in the garage. I may need to buy some more to wipe down my outside table and chairs, store some in my trunk for emergencies etc.My son-in-law had a habit of grabbing up his wife's dish towels and cloths to use for other things than dishes, so I decided to give him some of these for Christmas. He and my daughter got a laugh at out of it! I personally have used these before and was satisfied. I would toss dirty ones in an old small wastebasket in the garage until I had a load that I could throw in the washer. They usually washed up well and could be reused over and over again.
B009W391PQ|5|2003 Pontiac Vibe. Car moves, car shifts. Can't ask for much more from transmission fluid. Dropped the pan and changed out the filter and gasket with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NBSQ78?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1  worked good.<br /><br />Heads up to those changing transmission fluid in the 1.8 Liter Toyota engines, manual says 3.25 quarts when just doing a drain and fill. When I dropped the pan and filter with car raised up in front slightly I had about 5 quarts come out. Just know how much transmission fluid you need ahead of time, easier that way.
B00G6188EM|5|Excellent products
B00KHA2Z7O|5|Just as described it  fit perfectly.
B00KV7GQC8|1|Did not work for my car
B0017QNWR4|5|ok worked as expected
B00XQE8PVS|1|They don't stay in one spot. Very frustrating with the little to no grip. I'd recommend looking at alternatives.
B00JINPJD8|5|Great quality, design, and finish of a smart product.
B00KLIWMCU|4|Size was perfect.  Arrived on time!
B000KLZG3U|5|Amazing...Concentrated, I got 2-3 times the amount of washing I could do with the same amount of Meguiars Ultimate Wash and Wax...smells great and leaves a nice cleanliness that is ready for waxing
B003N8J6A6|5|Awesome little fans.  A little loud while running but not a bother.  Let's me know they are &#34;On&#34;
B00UGBQ7W8|4|Ordered 5 got 4! Other than that great decal!
B008YDJ56U|3|Gasket kit is great, all there. I expected the seals to be included but like the title says its a gasket kit. You get what you get and that's it. Worth the money
B000NU67V8|5|Excellent
B00CGTVCIC|4|Stays on the steering wheel very tightly and doesn't slip. I love that it doesn't have odors either. I bought the cover because my steering wheel was very slippery and I thought this would greatly help; it did help, but not a great deal. It's not as grippy as I wanted or expected. Other than that, the cover is great
B0031GTXQW|5|Excellent locking gas cap, at a great price.
B00W9OR3XW|1|If you like to gamble on what you buy, then go for it. If you want to know what your gonna get and when you'll get it and know it works. Then get something different.
B00EC0Z28O|5|Perfect fit!
B006KIZANI|5|awesome!!
B00009PGNR|5|owned 6 mos. fits in our freightliner cascadia perfectly. hint to all you people-the fuller you fill it, colder it stays! no prob with latch. didnt arrive damaged either. would buy another.
B000CB6FNS|3|Good but not so impressive
B00JGJH8QU|1|Delivered July 6th. The second time I used it one of the male terminals melted. I tried to return the item to have it replaced and it says the last day to return was August 8th and today is August 9th. Beware of 30 day only returns. Now I have a $60 hunk of plastic.
B00SCJNG7A|4|Lights fit into bumper like a glove. Had to grind down part of the metal where the bulb is inserted. Used a metal file on one and it took about 10 minutes. A grinder on the other and about 15 seconds. There is no way you can fit an after market bulb (I used Sylvania) into the socket without grinding down a part socket itself
B007S0LDME|5|Great for the Holding Tank Treatment.  No more smells.  Great product.  We have been using it in our RV Tank for years.
B004MXN71U|5|great!!
B00HV0S69O|5|I'm very pleased. My order came early and the item was just as described. High quality and affordable. 
B008NA314G|4|Goes on easily.  Directions are clear although you need to do it once to fully understand the way it goes on.  Sits on outside of window, but appears very solid material once stuck on.  Looks great
B00GE9Y5IE|4|Do not fit as perfectly as advertised, otherwise they are a good product.
B0059SA7KQ|5|These are great fasteners I used them on the fender liners for my XJ.
B001GBUX2M|5|Fit like a glove / easy to install
B000AM8C5I|5|Its the only product I put in my trucks engine besides oil. I also use it in the transmission and differentials. NASA uses it, its in the Guinness  book of records as the most viscous substance made.
B0031I0NCS|5|Decent price on an OEM rotor.  No pulsating after installing which has happened with rotors bought at Advan** and Autoz***.
B00WXYSYA4|5|Great ebayer
B00DNJPWSA|5|Great item. Fits my bike like a glove! Good strong material.
B00449YCIO|4|It fit my 2001 A4 and it worked.  Like the other reviewer, I had trouble with the piece that connects the two moving arms together with the motor.  In my case, I wasn't able to remove the metal piece that is attached to the motor because it was rusted on.  I reused the old part it instead of the piece that was included with the Vaico linkage.
B003U4PERW|5|This fits in the ashtray slot and is fantastic.  Now we have a place for our coffee travel cups while traveling in our 1973 VW THING!!!  The holder came is black as the only option - my husband spray painted it to match the color of our trim!
B003YJLAIK|5|Works as described.
B000RFLR0U|5|Great tool,found short within minutes
B00F5MCLE6|5|Made the job of washing my car much easier, unlike the soap water and bucket use.  Really soaps a vehicle; however, soap one side of vehicle and sponge clean before moving to next side.  Otherwise, soap will drip down the car before you get to it.
B00EEKOBWA|5|Great product,  fast delivery
B00QSNZBU2|3|Fit into place but the clips that connect the tailgate rods broke when I snapped them on.
B0013G040G|5|It was a perfect fit.And it works well!I will tell everyone where to buy for an great price and perfect fit!
B003VEZSYA|5|My husband is big into educating others on the rewards of recycling, and the dangers of not doing so.  This sticker on his car says it all for him.
B00OZ2VTTK|2|Don't recommend, unless you want to do a ton of fabrication Like I did, do not buy this one for a 2010 STI. All in all it works great for me after I fabed the crap out of it. You'll need an accessport or tuner afterwords to get your vehicle to run correctly and idle right. Hope that helps
B000CIGDAG|1|It's not a deeper pan for a 48re its the stock size
B007IOOIVS|5|Pretty good quality and was really sharp. Works as expected.
B00OZ1UJCE|5|Looks and sounds amazing.. and for that i thank you
B008IXN4RW|3|The &#34;bar&#34; is a white gum eraser. Using it noticeably lightened my tan colored shoes--presumably by leaving residue behind. Using the brush did not help to get the white color out.  It would be great on white or very light colored articles.  It's okay for anything else.
B00330A8Z6|5|saving  on gas  more  power
B00NWF5RUI|5|This is very solid product. Extremely easy to program. I did it in less than 5 min for a 2004 Chevy Silverado 2500hd.
B00WH6MIIW|5|Shipped fast & looks amazing in my FJ!
B005N53AM2|5|Fits perfectly on my jeep wheel. No issue with smell. It went away quickly. Only issue is the color fading but that's due to the sunlight from my roof being off.
B004TQZHNQ|5|The tire cover is just what we wanted and it looks great too!
B00JZSQWK0|5|I love this ring. The oval is retro, and it makes the remote &#34;key&#34; very distinctive with the anniversary logo. A small accessory, but a winner.
B004AQZA3W|5|Excelent
B00VM84DTS|5|Fits very well and as advertised. Easily adjustable to make it the &#34;perfect&#34; fit.
B001RBDTT0|5|Came fast then I thought love it always wanted the sticker now I got it !
B001TJ3HUG|5|Works great for the vehicle leather, we use it all the time to keep it maintained.
B00UVVAVMU|1|not for dodge pickup
B004PLAK5A|2|Worked well with my engine conversion until it died 2 weeks later. The plastic underneath the lens appeared to be halfway shattered out of nowhere. No light. Just died. It only had 12 volts from car. I ordered another one. Will see how this one holds up.
B00JQZG15S|5|Exactly as expected. Compact, bright.
B00YZ0Q4A6|1|No.  The rings did not fit.  They did not stop the juice from leaking.
B00HTV2JEI|3|It very, very slightly leaks from the ball bearing. It's good other than that. If I hadn't already locked it in I would try another one out.
B00PH5LG5Q|4|This works okay as a light weight vacuum.  It is small and compact.  Very easy to stow in your vehicle.  I received at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
B00KVVBEWQ|2|Ok the only way to describe this hard to use.  I have been using it only for local Los Angeles travel so I can't speak for the ease of use for long trips.  It took way longer than my phone to reroute if I missed a turn or went a different way.  It took such a long time it forced me further off course.  The battery life is annoyingly short.  I would have to say it only stayed charged for about 25 minutes.  I only have one outlet in my car and usually keep my phone plugged in so this alone makes me really dislike this GPS.  Honestly my phone is so much easier to use for navigation than this is I don't see a need for this at all.
B00BITR8WU|5|Easy to install. Only took a few minutes. Much cheaper than purchasing from Auto Zone or Toyota directly. Fits 2006 Toyota Tundra perfectly.
B00KCW5HNG|4|Its a seriously quality made product. The chain adjuster blocks are lightweight but beefy, which is a huge improvement over what came stock with the bike that tended to deform over time. I really like that the left side is keyed perfectly for the axle so it doesn't shift as you tighten the axle nut. The spools themselves have awesome fat bolts that are allegedly annealed to bend rather than break. What I don't like is that they're touted as protection, which yes they will certainly protect, but the face of the bolt is nearly flush with the surface of the spool/slider. If you lowside and the bike slides, you're 100% going to deform the face of the bolt and there's no way you're getting a hex bit in there to extract it. Not quite sure what R&G was thinking here...if you go down with these you're going to need a cut-off wheel and some vice grips to get the bolt out, honestly.<br /><br />I really appreciate the size of the bolts over the stock 6mm units that go into the swingarm, however(I had woodcraft units originally in the stock holes, and had the bolt bend and snap during a get-off in a way that made it pretty much impossible to extract, hence why I went for these). One thing to note is that end-to-end distance between the two spools is not the same as in the original spool mounting holes on the swingarm itself...meaning that if you intend to use these as lift points with a non-adjustable spool stand, you're probably going to be SOL so keep that in mind!
B006Z907TY|5|Just as described, fast delivery.  Very convenient to have your own extender, no problems on American Airlines flights.
B007R9ZUD4|5|love it! had it for a few years now, not a single stone has fallen off yet!
B00KHSN6S8|5|O K
B00125W9TM|5|Worked out great!
B007AOQORC|5|These car liners are perfect for my 2015 Camry SE Hybrid. They are great for protecting the carpets. As noted by others, the levers for the gas and trunk are covered - but I think that's fine. If you want one for the trunk, item 44541 fits perfectly into the SE Hybrid.
B003YJNCS6|5|Like the lead free idea. Water tastes very good or better than without lead free.
B004UQR1M0|5|I've been looking for a lug nut cleaning  alternative to my toothbrush for quite a while.  Wish I'd known about this a long time ago.  It's much more efficient than a toothbrush, and faster, too.  IMO, a bit on the expensive side, but I'm glad I bought it!
B000WK4CS4|5|Exactly what I needed. Trust this seller and product.
B001D93D5Q|3|Not as white as I expected still has a yellow glow.
B002XLHUQG|5|Holds the tires really steady and keeps camper steady.
B000CAINDE|3|Your average car shade.
B0051SERD2|5|Used this when a clutch line leaked and made bleeding the TR2 system a 15 minute job... and Dot 5 is worth the extra trouble of converting; getting the tygon tube stretched to go on the nipple was a 5 minute job but a match and needle nose pliers will get the tip over the nipple - that and brute strength,
B000IYSH9O|5|Just like factory. Easy installation and fit like a glove. No issues after 2 months of use. Would recommend as a replacement.
B006B2XQQ6|5|Definitely the best window shade I have ever seen!
B000BZG8ZU|2|had to return; did not fit my 2001 audi a4
B001INL9BW|5|Bought this as a mothers day gift for my mom who is a huge thumper fan. Was way worth to see her light up and immediately put it on her mini van window.
B001D20WOS|5|Doing a comparison to the OEM filter on my '09 Camry Hybrid, this is a great match in terms of material quality, pleat count, etc.  Very satisfied with purchase.
B00539IV3Q|5|Perfect for a dan
B007ZDIZFM|5|Fit like they should and look good, they are for 4 door civics not 2/3 door.
B001U8MPMM|3|Not for 60/40 seats
B00T7DOA6Q|5|Great product
B001O54U9M|5|Was a direct replacement for my 99 WJ with the 4.7 that had began leaking at the crimped fitting
B0002STTSY|3|It is an excellent crimper for its price. It does perform  well and I am very happy with the purchase.
B002P8SM32|4|Good replacement.
B0015YE3QC|5|Easy on and off application. I really like the bottom strap that can be used in areas with high winds to keep them in place. Glade I bought them.
B0002Q804K|2|worked well for a few months.  it is about as short-proof as the titanic was unsinkable though as I lost taillight functionality after a few trips to the boat ramp.
B00AC6Y6XY|5|Love this thing! Fits the Honda Grom nicely.
B002UD0GIG|3|Removes minor scratches and cleans plastics, but it not a fix-all.
B00GXRLJT0|5|Awesome
B00P2QAASO|4|The initial shipment only sent one of the two ordered. After figuring out proper message for missing item in shipment I sent and Email and Amazon says they are shipping the missing item,<br /><br />The item itself is a little smaller than I expected. They are quality material and should make it through my sons driver learning period. I would recommend these to a friend.
B00Z9FMU9U|5|Bright & great led lights
B00WZA1A1Q|5|Fit easily and quickly to a 2009 r6s. I'll update if they don't hold up.
B009AAEK3Y|5|6 screws pulled the consel back replace the module, very easy and fixed the intermittent problem of it not shifting into grar, at a very great price.... don't forget to plug the lighter connection back together.  Lol
B005ERMCPA|1|Super hard to do it I throw it away
B000CINV88|1|This product has a warning label that is disturbing. This product is known to cause cancer and birth defects in the state of Calfornia and I'm sure everywhere else their just more strict. (Proposition 65) I'm just pointing this out because the warning label should be in the description of this product on Amazon. As well as I do not buy products with these types of warnings. This product is messy and leaves residue.
B003UVCY00|5|Powerful light.  I have small dogs, my yard even though it has a small fence is adjacent to woods.  I'm afraid, since my dogs are small that wild life would hurt them.  I stand in the middle of my yard with this powerful light shining. Moving it back and forth as to deter any animals that might be in the area.  Great product.
B001P2A9I0|3|The installation was not at all like the instructions seemed to say.  The picture on the box was nothing like the contents.
B000C2AOGQ|5|Fit right in
B000RT80RY|4|As described
B00JW4O9FC|5|So far so good for my 1987 325 is.. almost as clean as stock.. so far haven't fallen off..
B005C95JDW|5|Awesome
B00252BVC2|5|Everything you could expect, very good price.
B00MINH13G|1|Wiring diagram is wrong. Anyone know what the correct wiring is?
B000C55T7W|5|worked perfectly for my 2001 cadi
B007KPUXVY|5|Good buy. Fast service.
B00JPLVS2Y|5|Ordered this awhile back, just got around to installing it.<br />Looks good in anodized red.<br />I measured against the old one and preset the jam nut to give me a starting point once installed.<br />Removed the old cyl.,  installed the new one, making sure to put the pivot spacer in its proper place and orientation.<br />Reconnected brake line, bled new cylinder and tried operation. Voila!! Clutch pedal now activates remote cylinder, which disengages clutch. Success is so sweet!<br />Good price.<br />Good quality.<br />Placement of bleeder screw is perfect for easy access when bleeding.<br />I would recommend and would buy again.<br />Fast shipping too!
B00MCIYNWE|4|Cool real looking patch
B000GV52KG|5|These are great highway pegs. There is a lot of room for adjustment so you can make them fit just-so.
B00HM9JZ76|5|Just what we wanted.
B00678LJRW|1|So I got mine thinking it was what I needed but the mechanic I brought it to said it was the throttle cable for a ski doo.  Can I still return it?
B0002SRJDG|2|Plastic spouts is too stiff and causes it to jump out of the fill hole and makes a mess.
B0058EBVXS|5|Never a problem! great battery!
B00V5PWWBE|5|Came fast fit right and did not disappoint
B001A0J2JO|3|The mirror is great, but does not fit my murano 2004 mirror.  Had to remove the spring loaded clip.  Then, I used self-locking ties to hold mirror in place.  Looks tacky, but does the job for now.
B000EDSSDY|5|Perfect to level your rv, trow it on the floor and go from there
B001810SHA|1|BEWARE...I put this in my car, followed instructions....immediately the compressor ceased. Serpentine belt burned off. Had to get car towed to repair shop. Apparently I overcharged the ac unit because the GAUGUE ON THIS DEVICE WAS FAULTY. Now I am stuck with a 850$ bill for replacing the compressor and belts.....you have been WARNED. Never Never buy this. May have worked for some people, but if you get one with a faulty gauge, you'll be out of luck.
B0009LSXAE|5|Product arrived quickly. Does tend to get on paint even when careful. Wipes off with a water covered rag. Doesnt stay black very long.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|These are not mounted yet but they are very nice.
B0007YGZA8|1|Not a good replacement. Doesn't line up with original bends and is also to long. Bottom nut placement is to low and is bent in the wrong direction. I have sent jbugs an email asking for assistance. Has been over two weeks with no reply.
B0105MROLK|1|pot metal clamps? first one snapped before it would stop spinning on the engine guard and I didn't get refund for shipping them back TTMT never again!
B006B3C3XC|5|These are very bright.  No flicker when dimming on or off. Perfect swap for OEM replacement.
B0081F0VFK|5|Lost the passenger side mirror of our 2012 Honda Odyssey when it got hit by a tree branch. Once I watched a youtube video on how to get the passenger door panel off, this was a piece of cake to install and worked immediately. Exactly what was needed and got delivered with amazon prime same day!
B0077T23IO|3|Overall the stands are decent quality for the price. The stands require some assembly on arrival, instructions are straightforward. The set i got however was in poor condition. The snap-rings holding the wheels onto the stands were all bent as if repeatedly jammed on and taken off, the wheels themselves looked as though they had seen extensive use. The lower ends of both stands looked as though they had been rougly handled and hamfisted into place with their mates several times. Even after all this the stands still work for the job they're designed to do, though i had to replace the snap rings for the wheels.<br /><br />The paddles themselves could use a thicker rubber, but again for the price i wasn't expecting it to be Top tier quality.<br />I would not reccommend these stands if you own a bike over 450lbs. I ride a Yamaha FZO7 and after a little diet(currently 378lbs wet), there is a small amount of flex when the bike settles on the stands. I thought this was normal, but using a friend's higher grade stand resulted in no movement what-so-ever.<br />Overall I'm content with the purchase, even if im not with the quality control at venom.
B009WAAM70|5|Works fine. No need to spend any more money than what this costs.
B0042VTYXM|5|Item was as described
B00N3404I8|4|Fits my bike well. Better response from the brakes now.  Only issue is it doesnt have the same bend as the factory line and so with the DRZ you REALLY need to force it as far as you can toward the outside as you tighten the master-cylinder banjo, otherwise it will rub on the rear spring.  Easy enough to do and working great!
B00N9LQBZK|5|So cute, they call me the queen where I work and I love cats so it was perfect for my car.
B00450DEI6|3|Cheaply made. After first washing there was water inside the seal.
B00TACQ6L6|4|Fits great but does let wind in I did fix it by just putting layers of electric tape on the gasket to make it a bit thicker. Over all its a perfect fit for my 2001 chevy silverado
B005A8ZBW4|5|Great addition to my bike.
B00AXRRF26|5|Great deal
B00K87UU32|1|Not well at all, split in half after being installed only a week, rode about 3 hours before noticing the split in the middle of the boot!!
B002QOYS42|1|This item might work on a bicycle, but after about 1000 miles on my ultra classic, I couldn't keep it tight on the handlebar. I threw it away after it kept twisting and vibrating against my left turn signal controls.
B00ERYNWVE|1|decal sticks to boths sides of backing and cannot be separated without a great deal of effort and loss of portions of bird. No hope of applying properly. The decal is either old, not designed correctly or stored in hot environment.
B00KT5DJCC|3|I installed the parts and everything fit,I put about 1000mil on and developed a bit of a squeak, I'm also getting a lot of brake dust on my rims. Which is why I replaced my old brakes.
B00HHH1N2I|3|Not sure if these bulbs live up to there quotes. &#34; 30 percent brighter than standard bulbs&#34;.<br />By comparison, these are probably the best &#34;filament&#34; bulb replacement, but shadow in comparison to most LED bulbs.<br />They are almost comparable to the luminescence of todays modern LED bulb.<br />Perhaps, these are a good replacement considering they are the only incandescent bulb on the market I could find.<br />But they are probably the only replacement for someone who desires to change the standard amber bulbs to red.<br />These did not snap in as easy as my stock bulbs, and I thought I was going to either break the bulb or my connector.<br />But eventually they went in. Not exactly or as smooth as expected for a replacement bulb, not like OEM.<br />Also, from looking at the photos I uploaded with this review, anyone can clearly see the stock amber outshining the Putco.<br />Yes, yellow (amber) is a brighter color than red. But if these are &#34;30% brighter than standard bulbs&#34;, the Putco Mega red should shine<br />just as bright as the OEM bulb.<br />When I installed these and compared them, it was a significantly noticeable difference. The red looked very dim like it was lacking power.<br />Also, these do not look red from afar, at least not to me. Up close they are clearly red, but these are barely noticeable in the daytime and at night.<br />As I mentioned, these are probably just as good or slightly above LED lights. I may end up purchasing a set of supposedly high end LED lights just to compare them with my Putco bulbs.<br />If they are in fact the same brightness as the LEDs, to save on amperage draw, I may switch these out for a set of LED's. Will post my results once the LED bulbs are received and installed.
B000765MHI|4|a little louder than I would like, but definitely does its job well
B00CELYMB6|1|Didn't really cover as expected. Seemed to be more clear liquid than paint. Seller asked for return but then said it was same as others so I just cancelled for a refund. A lot of trouble not to solve my problem.
B007XP5G3Q|5|worked as expected
B00EUN9KP4|4|License plate cover met all expectations of our golfing grandsons
B00VKXSF3K|4|Love how the blue lights make the interior lock.
B0007M3094|5|Already own another Curt Class 3 ball mount and needed a longer extension.  Built to last.
B00KA0KSD4|5|This thing is great.  Great material, does not look cheap at all, holds just enough stuff (hat, shorts, sunglasses) to get around town.  Definitely recommend
B00K007R6U|5|Excellent product. I smoke a pipe and keep Ozium in my car full time. That is a must, that is the reason, I buy four at a time, great product and long lasting in the Georgia. Heat of 90 plus degrees. If you have not tried this product, give it a try and you will be a believer.
B00SUNHB7Y|5|Unbelievable easy to install! Also no other equipment is need. Many other systems require extra hardware. This kit include everything besides basic tools obviously. Grab some electrical tape though if you want to double seal your ports with the included heat shrink wrap. Also it only took 3 hours to install and I was taking my time with 0 electrical experience.
B004C6Q50M|5|worked perfect
B002UVCK8C|5|Nice decal - Sticks well
B004QS8FTK|4|It fits our 2014 Toyota Tacoma well and the Velcro straps hold the bikes securely to the pad.  We also use bungee cords to secure the back wheel.  Go ahead and order extra Velcro straps because you'll lose one or two of the ones that come with the shuttle pad.
B003LSJJJ6|4|These are very comfortable, and the transition lenses are AWESOME.  Will have to see how they hold up in a sandstorm, but for now they're a great purchase!
B00E9E55IK|5|Worked perfect
B000C5DL3Q|5|Perfect OEM replacement and couldn't be easier to change! Don't let some yahoo charge you $30-$40 to change it. Buy this and do it at home in under 10 minutes.
B00TJ19MNM|3|These are sheepskin inserts.  In the seat and center back is sewn a the sheepskin.  The rest is artificial.  My advice is to spend the 200 plus and get the real deal.
B00JTGOV9M|5|Excellent product implemented in a shunt telephone extensions...
B001OKD8VI|5|Worked
B00FZJLCSU|5|Perfect!
B00NN80YFC|5|This thing works perfectly! I have it secured to my wake tower on my boat! Love it so far! I did have to get different clamps but that was because it wasn't made for wake towers!
B00VGL76CM|4|Does the Job.
B000EALHHG|3|Works alright on clothing.
B00NEJSHIQ|5|Color not exact match but is otherwise identical to my worn out factory floor mats.
B00P9R8O7K|5|Seems to be fairly well made , guess I'll know in about a month or two.  Had one similar to it years ago , and it was coming apart in less than a year.
B000CB42BK|5|Good morning!!have a question you said me this shock matching with my ford 2004 f150 x4 but it's a small size #!if you can check the right shocks and send me part number  ?I can return this Monday the rong parts!!thank you sorry for the inconvenience!
B00XZ9OKAY|5|Took awhile for me to set up but once it did works perfect
B00HEDAXU8|5|just what i needed.
B000E0E6GK|5|Well worth the money  fits great
B008G1XL2E|5|Awesome shipping. Just like originals.Nice part!
B004ALM13O|5|Good quality and good fit for my 1984 Datsun 720
B00RHMPR7A|5|Great buy; everyone I've shown or demonstrated to just love it, in some case ordered their own.
B008XN7SM4|5|I have a set that did not include a 22mm. If you work with/on high end or aftermarket wheels you need this.
B00124509O|1|this photo looks like its a cut out<br />the one you get hardly sticks (awful quality)<br />I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS FIRST<br />Here is a kicker it came in a box! with bubble pack????<br />WTF?  A sticker could have been put in an envelope<br />I threw it away - sad
B00JBZ9EXE|5|great stuff
B002DOME1E|5|Haven't used these yet, but they appear to be exactly what I wanted.
B0082GKQQW|2|Wonderful . We all loved it
B000AMBHG4|4|Almost a perfect replacement in my 2005 Terry (Fleetwood).  The mounting holes are about 1/4&#34; different so know that going in.  Otherwise if you're replacing a CCI LP gas detector, this is the best option I've found.  The price is a bit of a punch in the gut but its one of those things you have to have with any RV.  Replace it every 5 years as recommended.
B00TQ07IOQ|1|Cheap and thin.  Deluxe???
B011YIUL78|5|Though we have tinting on our van window, my children have complained for quite some time that the rays of the sun have still been reaching them and bothering them, especially when we are parked and sitting in the car waiting for my husband to run errands. This is especially an issue with my youngest son, who is very young and not very patient with things that irritate him...and he especially hates getting hot!<br /><br />I saw this set of 2 listed on amazon and decided to order. I had very high hopes that these would remedy my problem and give my kids some much needed relief from the sun. My package arrived quickly, just as described and in great condition.<br /><br />I was quite pleased with the material from which these shades were made and they seem very nicely constructed and like they will hold up to the wear of the sun for quite some time. They were easy to place and stayed in place perfectly. Now the real test...after installing we went on a long car ride to do several back to school errands and my kids were very pleased with the shade and sun protection these provided! They didn't complain even ONE time and my daughter even commented that she felt much cooler this trip. To me this means that I made a wise choice in ordering these and I am quite glad that I did! We love them!<br /><br />I received this product at no cost to me and have provided my honest and unbiased review in return.
B005992QKO|1|After about 3 months these pins had corroded to the point I couldn't take the hitch off or adjust the height.  After an hour of work pounding the pins out I freed the hitch to inspect it.  There was corrosion all over the entire hitch and both pins.  Since then I ground down the hitch and it works OK but continues to corrode.<br />Now today I went to unlock one of the pins and the keyhole has corroded to the point It won't unlock.  useless.<br />Buy one of higher quality if you live somewhere with weather.
B00G4DW320|5|great product...fast shipping
B001TXBUZG|5|Got my rack a few days ago. Put it on right away, well attempted. The two bolts on the side u have to take off were really difficult. My friend and i both had to sit on the bike while my other friend loosened them to prevent it from lifting off the ground. We finally got it and i use it to deliver pizzas. It's perfect.
B00BFDI0G2|5|Arrived fast...easy install of OEM equipment.
B00HCF4W28|4|Fit with no issues
B0006Q7H36|5|Great anti-seeze compound... easy to apply with brush on clean surfaces and withstands cchemicals used in automotive.
B00AOCUZUY|5|Nice radiator. Fit right in my nova. Dropped the temp of my car 20 degrees.
B009OLVVH2|3|Very spendy but very bright
B005M4GC74|5|Great
B007ZDXVQK|5|Very high quality product and great service
B007D5480S|5|fit my 2014 prius perfectly and since it is so easy to install and remove I only put it on when I need it.
B001P9RUU8|1|This Catalytic converter is not CARB California compliant.
B00QMWQK2M|1|Total waste of money! Don't buy these! I purchased this set and within a week the lining around the drivers side mat was coming apart.  Stitching is worthless and you would do better to just put paper towels down before you buy these!
B009PHDB4Q|5|Just as described. Super easy to install. Thanks
B00F9EEMMY|4|Works great
B00THLPSXM|4|I have gotten SO MANY positive comments about these headlights. It didn't fit the headlight opening perfectly, but they do fit just a minor gap on the p/s. Also, be aware that since they are smoked you will not be able to see as clearly and that's even with high beams on. This is only in certain areas though. Overall, I really like these headlights and so do many other people!
B00KX9WXW6|5|nice and heavy, should  hold up well
B00VH8W5KM|5|Great quality and easy to install
B0002MA3P8|5|For this budget you can beat them. They give decent output. They cover the spot before the bumper that is left out by headlights. Try to place it as close to the ground and on either ends of bumper for maximum efficiency. Do not remove the black housing that is covering the bulb as it is there to preventing these lights from blinding on coming traffic. These come with all hardware and even diagram. It has relay and fuses as well so chances of electric fire is small/nil. construction looks very good as well. my only complain is there seem to be some water going into the housing during car washes. But its been a year and none of the bulbs are gone. So I guess the water entering is small enough not to cause a short. I really love them. Cant ask more from a $35 bumper lights.
B000GTFH3A|5|Arrived quickly and is exactly as described.
B00CFQAHSM|5|Works great. It is much more powerful than computer fans people install. Plug and play- basically. It does run of the battery directly so it is up to anyone to install interrupt switch - or not. If you have a light kit with a horn some wire splitting may be required since fan an a horn share the same plug..... In any case the fan will run for about 2-3 min after the bike shuts off. This is much better than dealing with repeatedly overheated bike.
B000WZ5JPY|5|Perfect fit on 2015 Tundra. Easy install
B0041CDPQO|5|Fast shipping and product is as Exactly shown plugs right in and go
B00K9BD4IK|5|Just wow , I have to say the best Quality decal on the market!!! And the seller is awesome takes good care of there customers
B008S9QQ6C|4|Works as advertised.
B005CHFD62|5|Ty
B000NJAAA8|2|Worked just OK - Dawn Dish Soap worked just as well - you really need to scrub hard with a brush on your hands & knees to get the roof clean.  Also makes the surface very slippery after you spray an area.  Would not spend the $$ on this product again.
B002UC2XD8|5|Fit and works great!
B000BQUEWC|2|Cheap but functional
B000BPQGRA|5|Just installed and so far there is a noticeable increase in engine response and also power! Hope they last for a long time!
B003WLQNBE|5|Excellent product! Easy installation. Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Shipping was super fast. Thank you for making my life easy.
B0019I2V40|5|-- update aug, 3 2015 -- After about 500mi I notice that the passenger side is now clicking when changing directions for the first time. I took the wheel off today and double check all of the bolts to see if that was the issue but it didn't help. I originally lubed up the contact points well but not excessively but I can't see that lube really lasting long anyway so it's probably a fitment issue. I will contact Akebono to see what they say before I change my rating.  -- original review -- I used these on the rear of my 06 Jetta a few years ago and now purchased the fronts. They feel a little more progressive (which I guess can be attributed to mushy) but I like the feel and they stop just fine when you lay on the brakes. I used the Zimmerman Z-Coat rotors (idparts had the best price when I ordered). You might want to pick up a brake sensor connector repair kit from eBay. Mine was broken. Part number is  1J0973802.
B002SB03IS|5|I bought this for my new Tacoma.  I had a bed mat similar to this for my GMC Sonoma.  The purpose is to protect the bed from the 500 to 700 pounds of bar steel I haul on a weekly basis.  I also use it on occasion for personal landscaping hauling bulk mulch and gravel.<br />The rubber mat also prevents things from sliding around.<br /><br />This fiber reinforced mat was heavy enough to be protective.  The bottom side rubber button texturing provides drainage.  Fit was excellent....just drop it in.  There was no need for trimming to accommodate tie downs. Price was good.  Actually cheaper than third party offerings.
B0007M30BC|5|Great product at a great price.
B00IPS3H1I|5|Excellent oil. Used it on my ford ranger with 150k miles.
B005NWEEEI|5|Cheapest I could find.
B00Z7KIZPA|3|I got this for my Jeep Wrangler.  I don't like to sit my purse on the floor mats and I don't like it on the seat because it has a tendency to slide off the leather which can end up with contents all over the Jeep.  Well, while the concept is good, the product needs some work.  The straps are way to long and unless both seats are in the exact same place (which seriously who's are?) the pouch ends up being diagonal and well, sloppy looking.  I need something that is going to be firm and tightly held not loose and floppy.  Like I said good concept but it needs some work.
B0006IX7WY|5|You can't go camping with an RV without these in your refrigerator. Well, you can, but I don't want to be there when you open you refrigerator the first time after driving a long way:)
B00C7I4XQ0|3|Good size, but spills salt each time you unscrew the cap. Aside from that it works fine.
B00IQVBVO4|5|It looks beautiful on my car--I'm a Patriot!
B00D52FF7I|1|Only came with one bracket. It is not plug and play
B0009IQX90|5|Works great for bird droppings, even in a hurry. I usually just spray once, wait a few seconds and lift off with a microfiber towel. The first such product I've purchased (based on reviews)-- glad I did.
B000C3YST4|4|very good for the price.
B003N5IHHM|5|Nice decal - Sticks well
B004TR8M3W|5|Easily pull 30' trailer.  No sway from large trailers passing.  Driven in some light wind, ~10mph and you can feel it pull, but the entire vehicle moves (truck+trailer) and never felt unsafe.  Easy to put on and off.
B00UHD4HJA|4|great price for the number of stickers you actually get! i gave the set to my nephew.. told him to stick them on on his laptop. :)
B004A6JA2O|5|A filter of this quality for this price point is fantastic. So easy to replace my old one in the 2012 Prius I own. The dealer charges $75-80 for a less than 5 minute action.
B00MANSZCA|5|Looks amazing on the front of my blacked out truck
B00069CN2I|5|Fits great on Tahoe love these!
B004UM6DLE|5|This stuff stinks like crazy but it works! I used it on my new clean ( purchased 3 weeks ago and already washed many time) and the car has a born on date from the factory about 6 weeks ago so the car has not had time to get dirty or so I thought. After a few minutes I could see the iron particles start to run or bleed down the side of my car after using IronX. I truly thought my car was clean. I am thinking it was iron from the rail delivery.<br />After the IronX I used a clay bar and I think the Ironx  did most of the work for me as the clay removed almost nothing.<br />Recommended product but must be used outside as it stinks almost as bad as a skunk.
B005A7508K|5|Well made. Perfect fit for Honda Civic 2012
B00E5O7HDU|5|just beautiful...great
B005OL7K4E|5|How can you not love it...
B000JZ79NC|5|:)
B00IY2CR6Q|5|This wiper arm, combined with the Trico 14-C Exact Fit Rear Wiper Blade (which clips on the end of this wiper arm) returned my new-used 2005 Durango to a factory look. I had to bend it back a little bit (as if  bending it out for window cleaning) to get the nut to start threading with the small enclosed key in place. Very easy to install, and from now on I'll buy the inexpensive trim-to-fit wiper blade replacements to avoid purchasing the Trico again.
B000XJG304|4|I only had to repair couple of very small puncture holes, on my Yamaha FZ1 seat and and backrest on a Honda Valkyrie. It did a pretty good job.<br />I'm not sure how well it will work on larger tears or rips!
B00IMEX0AI|5|It's like having a different car!  I wear hearing aids and no more wind howling through them.  I can actually hear the radio now. We don't have to hang on to everything in the cockpit so it doesn't fly out.  Only downfall is I can hear my wife telling me how bad I'm driving.  I received it four days before estimated delivery date.  Good company.
B000C5HFCE|5|Well worth the money. I replaced the Yamaha boat standard straps that I could never get to stay tight and had to remove and store when launching. The BoatBuckle straps tighten and loosen easily and stay in place retracted on trailer after launch. I added one to the bow also.
B008VDIVHC|4|It was delivered as promises and quality is good...it would've been great if the screws that come with it to attach the license plate are too short and require a special size allen or torx screwdriver that aren't standard size; I had a set of allen wrenches with almost all of the sizes except the one required.
B0082OYG3I|5|fits and looks great
B0031GR07G|5|Easy installation and working perfectly!!
B00LEBLI82|3|Bulbs are great for current draw and how hot they get, but they are dimmer then the 1141 bulb they replace, hence, you have to have more on for light.
B001NN7BBO|5|Works great!!
B00JXYGNKA|1|did not work would not switch in
B004O844DS|5|Worked perfectly. Used in BMW X5 for camping trip. I also bought the extended peice and cargo net.
B00DU6R7TI|5|very nice i like it !
B0051WJEZY|5|Great product
B004ZF4RXC|5|The lights are great and have had no issues! Would highly recommend!! Fast shipping and great service.
B00CMHY0UA|4|after install it worked great. I wished the install was as easy as some have claimed.
B000C8T96Q|5|Good product and quality
B00JMGAZIA|5|Works well,good product.
B005FJXWP6|4|These seems like quality components but they were not drop in replacements for OEM 07 Honda Civic brake rotors and pads.
B010C8FAWW|5|It is great
B00QN943CI|5|Works great and it was a great price!! Thank you!!
B00439Q05S|5|Fast shipping, great price!  I installed this about a month ago and it works great!
B00F47Z2J8|5|Great lights very bright good buy
B00SGD5NGO|5|It works as intended good results
B00XFS3OU2|5|decent quality does not loosen up and better than the stock phillips screw
B009S94RK8|5|Very Nice product
B00KTJ9LD4|5|PERFECT a
B00S1NT2SE|1|Did not fit the adjustment screw well,kept slipping so I took the screws out and<br />made slots for a screw driver.
B002I1QC1U|1|The supplied studs are coarse thread studs and the supplied nuts are fine thread.  While using a ratchet to install the emblem, it felt as if everything was threading in fine but I quickly realized that the nut was not threading on the stud but instead the stud was threading into the emblem which after three full turns had stripped the threads out of the emblem making it completely useless.  For reference the studs actually take two #8-32 coarse thread nuts that are not expensive but are still an additional cost and trip to the hardware store if you don't have them lying around.
B00E63THQA|4|Great product for price!
B000EQU2QC|5|This is exactly what I needed for my 2006 Chevy cobalt and solved the problem of my taillight bulb popping out! WAY cheaper than manufacturer prices!!
B000R3PCE4|5|A gorgeous chunk of aluminum delivered very quickly!
B004I0IAI2|5|Had a brain fart and backed over a rotting stump causing my OEM passenger side foglight to shatter. I picked this one up for ⅓ of the dealership price. Fit perfectly in my 2007 Silverado 2500 classic.  Installation was a breeze. All you need is a 10mm socket on a ¼&#34; drive.
B00S2097FE|5|Nice novelty itme
B000SNBSMI|5|Easily stuffs back into the included bag and fits well into the luggage for easy travel. Keeps the bike dry even in bad storms. Love it and the price as exceptional...
B010CA65P6|5|👍
B00NZ86KB2|5|Factory new and arrived on time!
B000B8GAPK|5|perfect cap still works
B007I6Z05Y|5|A great hood lock. Took around an hour to install and the level of difficulty is easy to moderate. The side screws pose a challenge to install.<br /><br />Otherwise looks sturdy and awesome on my new wrangler unlimited sport JK 2015. It is an absolutely essential item for SAFETY.
B0014VU1SU|5|Works great
B000BUQOB8|5|Good
B004CM5WPA|4|arrived faster than expected.great product
B002KMMBEY|5|A+A+A+A+A+A+A+
B00AEC9DNY|4|So far, so good. These parts were a great bargain and installed very easily. My truck runs great and is even getting better gas mileage.
B00X6DVHUK|5|Absolutely perfect!
B004APM12G|5|Just what he wanted!
B0040Z9C32|5|great fit!
B001FZNIL2|4|Pretty nice net for the price.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|I got this for my son's car.  He has a midsize VW and it fit really well.  We live in a very hot area and being able to use a front shade makes a huge difference the next time we get in the cars.  Happy with this purchase!
B004I12MXK|5|Great deal can't tell the difference.
B00B1F19DK|2|At first the kids loved these headphones.  The headphones connected to my 2012 Town & Country with no problems and the sound was great.  However after only a few uses one of them cracked and then a few more weeks another pair cracked in the same place.  They weren't even used 10 times but I think the act of the kids folding the headphones is what caused them to break.  For the price I was hoping to get a long life out of the headphones.
B00WY5L09O|5|Give yourself 20 minutes a side and your headlights will look almost perfect.  Used Flitz after the rubbing compound and I think it gives a better overall shine (which means the finer scratches are gone.  I used it with a cordless drill and some water so it was more like wet sanding and the disks lasted longer but took longer to get rid of the hard spots on the lens.  I tried another product that didn't use the drill adapter and believe me, you don't want to waste your time sanding that much.
B007TYNAD4|5|Great kit and fast delivery.  No complaints.
B00KUAL17G|4|Soft no scratch and washable.
B0006IX85K|5|Great for dehumidifier drain hose<br />Nice price
B0000AY2BR|4|Well made and bright.  I'd suggest this for anyone looking for a 'forth' light.
B009YP8PH2|5|weighs a ton but seems well made
B00D9S3ZGG|5|great!!
B001J9ROPK|5|Perfect fit for 2004 330xi
B00EYVJUAW|4|LIKED SLIGHTLY SMALLER DIAMETER
B00MTK89RA|5|Kinda cheep but look good worried if they will fall off after I power wash it after missing hope not love the look though
B000C2Q6KE|5|I got this to install myself but didn't have time.  Turns out that there were other problems besides this that my '98 GMC suburban had, so it was good I had my mechanic do the work.  After all the work was done, my Air Conditioning worked fine.  It turned out to be a lot of work for the mechanics, my evaporator needed to be replaced and some other hoses.  I used Four Season's brand to save cost for the other parts too; I think the quality is there.
B001O0BJUK|5|good price and it works well in my towncar
B004ZO3VN0|4|good item
B00E0NSL54|5|Works as well as advertised.
B001KO84I0|5|Just finished changing a motorcycle tire and used this to remove the valve stem. Works like it should.
B00IUV7PFO|2|Voltage reads at 18.19 and keeps jumping around randomly. 16-18.88 beeping nonstop. Faulty battery?
B001KSDZXK|1|Sorry ACDELCO. A control arm that fits a 98 BMW 318i , does not fit a 98 m3.  Thanks for wasting my time and money !
B00Q88Q7CS|5|This works great and installed in about ten minutes. You'll want to have a multimeter to figure out which wire to cut but once that's done it's a breeze. I've been told when riding with a group that whoever is riding in the sweep position can see when I break before anyone else. Hopefully the cages are seeing it too.
B00QU3YAIY|5|Keeps hot stuff hot several hours. Great for coffee or coco.
B00JBQQZHQ|5|As expected. But really difficult to install.
B00S4OUNQ0|4|Nice touch
B004ME8MZ0|5|Fits tight, works great, no issues with quality,  good value
B008ZDYLC2|4|The device worked well for reading out the error codes on the car and also allowed real time monitoring of the readouts for all of the sensors.  However, I had to run in generic mode.  It didn't seem to have a lot of cars loaded into the device.  I was testing a 2001 lexus, so it wasn't a new car.  I bought an extension cable, but the stock cable was long enough to plug in on the lower left side and run up and across the dash so that the person in the passenger seat could run the device as we drove.
B00HRSTQ30|5|Super bright! Very easy to install and very fast shipping!!!
B00IPS4APU|4|GOOD GOOD
B0030X2XOK|4|We used these locks to secure historic documents in a public space where we had previously had an item stolen.  The locks allow us to secure, very inexpensively, irreplaceable documents and photos that enhance the visitor's experience at this monument.  They are invisible to the visitor but provide the security without the need for costly electronic alarms or surveillance cameras.  This is a terrific way to ensure your valuable wall hangs are protected in an undetectable way.
B002529YXU|4|exactly what I needed to change Volvo oil.
B009VTNA6C|5|Very good product good handling could not be happier
B00AMALSQ8|2|Super fast shipping. Since I didn't know the part number, I relied on pics to order the part. When I received it it looked diferent from pics. It fits and works but it's not the same as what i had.
B0030HGQ6W|5|EXCELLANT PRODUCT!  EVERYTHING WORKED JUST FINE!
B000GD5FMY|5|Great product and it arrived on time.
B008L5J5G6|5|Great.  Have not had a need for the addon flash
B008VQ1CE8|3|I was a little hard to tighten on the gear shift, but we got it to work.
B00DLMGH0Q|5|Can't beat the price, have been on for one week now without complication. Keep in mind though. If you have projector style headlights the color will be a little off. Example, I have the 8000k but coming through the projector headlights they look more like 6000k. Just thought I'd share.
B000P17NXQ|5|Makes a huge difference in how my trailer stops but caution do not set to max setting  it came defaulted to 15 I made the mistake of not toning it down abs the first time I towed it was locking up my trailer tires when I applied the brake about 3/4 of the way if recommend starting at abbot 8 fir a 2k lbs trailer and bumping it up until you find your sweet spot and don't forget to buy the vehicle specific harness for your truck makes it a 10 min job and you don't have to cut or splice in most cases simply hook up a ground eerie and plus in to the pre weird harness must trucks come with
B001PYSROG|5|Good  set
B000BVRZ74|5|New formula for years now and works great. steel wool 000 windshield, put two coats of this, let dry to haze twice, slap a drenched rag on and wipe off. Done!
B007VR71HA|5|Have two of these rack.  They are fantastic and easy to install.  My recommendation is that a 2x4 is used against to wall to ensure that all the studs are hit.  The rack can be installed on the mounted 2x4.  The feet that are on the bottom can be adjusted to compensate for the 2x4 additional distance from the wall.
B0050SKK5C|2|Will not fit 1969 Corvette with manual 4 speed.  Interference with clutch linkage (Z-bar).
B009F590L6|5|Easy to install, very good quality, very happy with is product.
B009B6IQHS|4|So far so good. Came within a week. Easy installation. Its Worth what you pay.
B000CI6H2A|4|It is doing it's job.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  Now if I could just keep my 2 year old from taking it off the window. Lol. Came fast and just as described.  I would definitely buy from this company again.
B001DRJ8OS|3|Disapointed to see made in china on an AC DELCO box.
B00ED3YVWS|5|Great - thanks..
B00IO9CG8S|4|First time I used this style of brakes. Everything fit and looked great. Customer service was great. Got answers to my questions within and hour of me sending an email.. The only thing I don't like is they are louder than stock brakes.
B0014GCDAE|5|Fit my vent with not problems.
B000NJAAA8|5|The product I ordered turned out to be fantastic, did the job it was supposed to do clean and protect, thank you so much for your time on sending me the package directly in a timely manner.
B006D9WHU8|5|Replaced my tired stabilizer on my 2004 TJ Rubi and this Teraflex works great. I can drive on the highway at 55 mph and I have almost zero steering vibration. would recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade or just replacing.
B000C83QHY|5|Worked great in my truck.
B00NWGZ3A6|5|Very small - only about 1/2&#34; thick.  Comes with a form fitting hard plastic case.  The display is large and easy to read.  Auto ranging and even measures capacitance and AC frequency up to 100KHz.  Only downside is 400mA (0.4A) limit on current measurement.  Larger, more expensive meters often include a 10A input.  Otherwise, this is a really nice meter with more features than most folks will ever use.  I have yet to check measurement accuracy and will update if any notable problems.
B000CAVE5S|5|Excellent fit for a 1999-2002 Saab 9-3 if your air conditioning compressor seizes.
B00123J79O|5|If you have any noises that are easy or hard to pinpoint, this chassis ear will give you 100% confirmation. I have used this at least 2-3 times a day since I received it and it has pinpointed the issue every time.<br />  I almost replaced front struts for a noise while turning the wheel. I wasn't 100% positive though. After hooking up the chassis ear I actually found the noise coming from the steering rack. Struts are a common noise on the particular vehicle I was working on and if I hadn't had the chassis ear I would have made a mistake that cost me 3 times what this tool cost.<br />  It's ease of use is amazing. So simple to hook up and use.<br /> I will never diagnose any front end noise without confirming with the chassis ear again. I wish I had bought this machine years ago. This should be a must have for any DIY or technician.
B001R5VVTQ|4|This is a good product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is Masterlock could have used a higher quality lock and charge me an extra $3.
B00AKEWUMM|5|Fits fine in my 2003 Chevy Tracker.  It seems to be constructed sturdily.  Not really much more to say about it than that.
B000C9HIUE|5|Exact same springs removed from my 91 Chevy Caprice.
B00ENOP4M8|5|Worked exactly as described.
B00Q4AS1G0|5|Great!! My lock like new in 25 minutes! 325i
B007BXCLQU|5|I use purolator filters in all my cars, off road polaris rzr and generac generator. Do internet searches for proper fit. 2 day dilevery with prime and a great price.
B007ILANWY|5|works very good but NEEDS igniter !!
B00V14XVGY|4|Bought this color on the website great color and fast shipping. I just with they would give more detail on what colors would show just like the speed shape if black or white pigment is added. I would also like if they did free shipping for orders over a certain amount and a thank you note couldn't hurt (just from a small business aspect). The pigments are wonderful however and will be ordering again..
B008EKTB7G|5|Item arrived in good condition and fit my gulf stream and made the appearance of my travel trailer look good again.
B00TG8ZP0W|5|I am so happy with my license frames, my car looks beautiful, thank you!!!
B00NEL6HT0|5|Mechanics at the dealership had never seen these, but they installed it very easily.
B00D3298A0|5|These floor mats are a steal!  I needed new ones when i became and Uber driver, and these really helped my car look (and smell) like new.  The smell is strong for the first week or two, but I kind of liked it.  Mmmmm neurotoxins smell gooood.
B00DJ4FGMQ|4|It is oil
B00340FBUC|1|They stick out and look odd. I didn't expect that.
B00JMCCDXE|5|This is the best Pennzoil products on the market made from natural gas processed through a GTL chemical process that yields a high quality base stock ready for additives enabling it to meet the API-SN, ILSAF-GF-5, and ACEA A5/B5, A1/B1 standards. These are the highest standards for gasoline engines either in the USA or Europe. Now is Amazon would only carry it in the 5 qt containers.
B005ZHRNOE|5|this fit my 07 gti pretty much perfect. it does a nice job keeping the heat out. it rolls up well, it's smaller than my old accordion style sunshade.
B00542X7AY|5|They give you 3 choices 1 should work yellow one worked for me
B007TY59W4|5|Item came quickly and was exactly as advertised. I am incredibly pleased!
B00MXLRXE0|5|Came in early.. match my 00 R6 perfectly.. came white..match picture..worth the money for sure..
B008ZDYLC2|5|This item paid for itself during its first use and it's still saving my family, neighbors and I money.
B00IDHJZXU|5|Very good product!
B00B8Z5D12|4|Quality parts only problem with the fender is the top hole for mounting to the grill support is missing but I just drilled one.
B00HVHJR1S|5|Excellent
B0068FVLAE|5|It was exactly what I expected and the fit was perfect.
B00VGH34Q8|4|Pefect fit and use for my range rover sport
B00VE399TK|5|It was awesome I love MI mirrors thanks
B00BTGDR9A|4|Pads work good. But come with pads that you won't use.
B002X1NLOQ|5|i like it
B008CE070E|5|WELL BUILT DOES THE JOB OFFSET PIN HOLES GREAT
B00REQ1YCQ|5|All is good
B00P8DEXFC|5|Perfect fit and good quality
B00BWB36V6|5|Perfect. Installed in 5 minutes. Fit was perfect and other than the plastic seeming a tad bit thinner, it was exact replica of OEM piece. Fraction of the cost of what dealer was going to charge me to replace cracked taillight.
B000QFVJ5O|5|These work great.  I was able to change front motorcycle tire and ready to ride in about 2 or 2 & 1/2 hours.
B001ET0O6Q|4|Nice set up,  easy to install.  Between removing the factory exhaust and installing this one, all said and done took about 45 min. The only negative, if I had to list one is that it is much quieter than I thought it would be,  was hoping for a little more grunt.
B000CO7IK4|4|Works as described. Some play in the housing where the wire leads attach but shouldn't affect performance.
B00MPRAYY8|5|We use this Reservoir as a vent for the fuel cell in our cars. They work perfect. We added a filter in the side nipple so it can breathe. Very easy to mount and solid construction. We are using the same system in
B000CO7QLK|1|The dam shredder valve busted soon as i removed the ac machine from it. Lost all my freeon gas. Dont buy this i know its cheap but u get what u pay for.
B003M78PGE|3|I originally purchased this item in October 2011 for our non-everyday vehicle. As others have said, the handle doesn't return completely to its true resting position, but it met the needs of this vehicle at the time.  Now I have a young driver that is using the car daily.  The handle broke after about one year of intense use.  For a cheap replacement to &#34;get you by&#34; this fits the bill.  I am moving the rear door OEM handle to the driver side and will consider this option again to replace the lesser used rear door.
B002BJEG3U|5|great product...fast shipping
B00HE9UBHW|5|The  device came within days and it has met my expectations after installation.  Interesting how my local car dealership where I purchased my car did not cooperate in giving me the specifics about the  part.  Fortunately, Subaru  headquarters did cooperate with me.  They perceived intelligently  that I would  have a problem purchasing a Subaru again if they did not offer me this important product information.  By the way, I am real happy with my Subaru Outback purchase  of  several years ago.
B001CEJH0W|5|This was easy to install works well and will save you a small fortune from having the dealer put one in for you. It's seriously easy, if you can change the filter on your home AC unit you can definitely install this filter!!
B0038N51M8|5|Looks great!
B0044GB6MM|5|perfect fit,great price, on time delivery.Just what I needed
B008I7PAUC|1|Mirror is a piece of junk.  It will not go high enough to see appropriately and is a driving hazard.  Maybe it will work for someone under 3 feet tall which I am not.  I am not a giant either, 5'8&#34; tall.  There is also a stupid rubber boot inside to supposedly cover the electronics & motor behind the mirror but it was off and impossible to reseat correctly.  Initially I thought the boot was blocking the movement of the mirror so after trying to reseat it I ended up removing it entirely  but the mirror still wouldn't work correctly.  The mirror does angle down dramatically to view the ground next to back door...not very helpful though. I even tried flipping the motor in case it was assembled incorrectly but it didn't help much.  What a waste of time and money.
B002Q0RIRK|5|Excellent quality.
B000C544X2|3|Not genuine moog brand but worked fine.
B000NJ14B2|5|worked  great
B00ENR73MY|5|I love this decal!
B001Q4KZTK|5|Exact fit. Thank you very much!
B00G3BRNZ0|5|I drained out Castrol High Mileage Synthetic blend from my 07 chevy Suburban with a 5.3 and replaced it with this royal purple high mileage.  At start up it sounded about the same...Slightly less noise I would say.  I'm not sure if you can say it was quieter because of the Royal Purple or because the Castrol had 2,500 miles on it and it was time for a change.  I will say that it did have a little valve noise at first.  It did however quiet down after about 2minutes; which I would assume is about how long it took the oil to fully cycle through the motor and coat the metal surfaces well enough.<br />I did notice a difference on long road trips and after I got the motor really warmed up.  The Castrol always had a slight valve rattle even when it was just poured in.  The Royal Purple seems to keep the noise down at all temps, especially after long trips when the engine is nice and hot.  When I pull up to a stop I no longer have the infamous 5.3 afm rattle.  If you know about the chevy afm motor you know what I am talking about.<br />My 5.3 has never really had a problem with excessive oil consumption, so I can not speak for oil burn with the Royal Purple.  I generally have put .75 to 1 quart per 3k.  I would not consider that an oil consumption problem.  I have 120k on the motor and it runs Very strong; 1 quart every 3k is fine by me.<br />Overall, I think it has made my engine run a bit smoother and quieter.  I will buy again.
B003P5PJNK|5|very pleased.
B00QPQD1NQ|5|Arrived on time, but was very disappointed because it did not work at all. I e-mail 1byonet about there product and with in 1-2 days had another one in the the mail to replace the defected one. Received the new one and it works great. Great product and fantastic customer  service. Thanks 1byone
B00HWPYU6Q|1|IT LOOKED GOOD AT FIRST BUT IT STARTED TURNING A GOLD COLOR I ACCUSED MY NEIGHBOR OF STEALING MINE,NOW THAT I SEE ALL THESE REVIEWS I AM GOING TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM!!!! IT WAS GOOD WHILE IT LASTED I WISHED THERE WAS SOME KIND OF PROTECTION FROM GETTING RIPPED OFF ON AMAZON WITH CHEAP ASS KNOCK OFFS.
B001O07TAO|5|Good
B005FLZQZ8|5|Good front grill.
B00HCTIW0W|5|Easy to install. Makes my door strong again
B000YS9P54|3|Worked but not for a large family.
B008FCG3XI|5|Product fits great. Box arrived a little damaged but no harm to the mat.
B005NXMFW0|4|A snap fit! Hope this holds. Time will tell
B006ZVF9H2|5|They worked on my helmet and that made me happy.
B005O01SDE|5|Perfect fit, good price and fast shipping. No complaints.
B00RSHZLTI|5|Very good quality and arrived when promised. Already moved it to another vehicle without any problem.
B0007WTE08|5|Works Great
B00J9OJW7A|5|The initial device I received did not work, but thanks to Ivy an excellent CSR for Buyee who quickly shipped a replacement, I am very satisfied with the final product.
B0009IQZPW|5|Meguiar'sX3070 Soft Foam Applicator Pads  made my polishing easy to apply just the right size for the job.
B0077CPV12|5|I used a friend's lift to raise the entire car, then wait for 30 minutes for the exhaust to cool.  The items works great...
B005VXE64W|5|Fit right up to the existing holes. I had to go by the hardware store and get some 5mm nuts, because this doesn't come with nuts, and a friend of mine &#34;helped&#34; me by throwing away the original ones.
B00ZE5RGTY|5|This is a great kit for the price. The phone mount isn't quite as nice as the one I have that suctions to my window, but if you don't have one of those, the included mount is a great option.  The car seat catcher works very well.  It is a little bit too small to just sit between my seats, but the bottom of it can rest against the space on my floor between the seats and it works well there.  The sticker is really great!  Best &#34;Baby On Board&#34; sticker I've seen.  It is clever and has a funny design.  All in all, this is a really great kit for the price and I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an affordable option for these items.
B002ZBWKAU|5|This thing is awesome, my tires get low on air pressure and a quick pump will bring is all back like new. It pays for itself with the cost of using those gas station tire things.<br /><br />also, it works for bikes and has an adaptor for sports balls. I'd say it's the best thing for the money. Maybe you could get a little cheaper but, this is definately excellent quality and you won't be dissapointed that you bought a chincy piece of junk.
B00II5YD4S|3|After using for a few months I wish I had gone with a larger blade. However it seems work alright, just too small.
B003AW45PG|3|Works on my '98 Civic LX. Definitely not like the OEM links, though. There's no metal spacer between the two middle washers.
B0077CSNGW|3|It fits perfect for my SUV and looks awesome, however it had a strong bad odor that transfers to your hands when driving or rubbing your hands over the steering wheel. It lasted for two months, I have it little over two months. Now it's fading.
B004ZVRGXO|2|Damn good bulb were small but I bent the piece it works amazing but blinks while the car is off will this kill my batt I think so  I am removing till I find out more
B000BGM89Y|5|GREAT SYSTEM !!!  The lower drainage on this one is brilliant compared to all those with top-side drainage.  It rolls along just fine and it a breeze to empty & rinse clean.  Very sturdy too !
B000HEBR3I|5|When the product arrived in its original packaging, none the worse for the trip, with just the address label, I wasn't sure if it would work. IT DID! And timely shipping/arrival too!
B008CLNYPC|5|Fades a little bit but still works great.  It's kinda a dull black but no rust after a year.  Plenty of mounting options. Bought one. Then bought another one a year later.
B003QU3HW4|5|this mat is awesome!! we took it to our beach vacation, and it was perfect for the whole family to lie on without getting all sandy!! would definitely recommend!!
B001C6Q7US|5|Auto parts stores (Advance, Auto Zone, Napa) near Raleigh, NC, wanted well over $100 for this item, some even had it in-store. So my decision was to save $100 on the part & have family go w/out AC for several days in mailing time...or not. Even worse financial outcome if I had the dealer do it. Vendor here shipped it @ breakneck speed & had it in 2 days instead of estimated 5 or so! Thank you! Our ride is an '05 Suburban w/ manual HVAC controls (not digital face) & thankfully, this is truly an easy problem to fix since our issue was hot air blowing from the passenger's side, instead of driver's side...so we only had to access the passenger's side unit, which is right under the glove compartment. Driver side is far more of a bear as the dash has to be dismantled. As far as the recalibration after install, you can get verification that it's taking place because if all is fairly quiet, you can actually hear the unit &#34;whirring&#34; as it's doing the recalibration. I did have to go through the process TWICE before the passenger's side started blowing cold air...so don't have cardiac arrest if it doesn't work after your first recalibration pass. That is, after bolting the part in & plugging in the wiring harness, had to disconnect battery for two minutes, reconnect, remove 10 amp HVAC/ECAS fuse under hood for 60 seconds, turn ignition key to &#34;on&#34; (all the way w/out starting engine) for 2 minutes, turn off key, then start engine. Had to do all that two times. This definitely qualifies as one of those automotive repairs you can do yourself @ monumental savings to yourself & family.
B00396FBRY|3|For the money the mini ear works ok. You can only really hear anything through the clamp attachment, the end that's attached produces zero definitive noises. I'm giving 3 stars because the clamp attachment is excellent. The price is low so with this you honestly get what you pay for. If you are looking to replace your stethoscope with this tool just don't throw the stethoscope away because this will not replace it.
B008UFPSB8|5|Replaced after 175,000 miles! The original cabin air filter looked like an ecosystem when I took it out! The clogged filter may be the reason why I needed to also replace the blower motor resistor.
B0031I5Z80|5|Very happy did the job that was needed of them
B000PGXP5G|5|quality made, works as advertised
B000LV7XN0|1|I received a defective blade.  One of the two blades does not lay flat on the windshield.  The result is that there is a big gap in the wiping.  Will never buy these again.
B004HFGV8O|5|Very nice quality, mounts great on flat surface.
B00OYAFQL0|5|Excellent, so easy to get on I don't have an excuse not to wear it. Breathes better than expected too.
B000JILNAY|5|Blue - club - really like.
B00B90J9YI|5|This is a great buy works great but not a direct bolt on following instructions for the name brand one . Works awsome
B001VZN6ZY|4|Small easy install
B008VO5Z7K|5|Great part, best price I could find.
B00W6J0WYM|1|Tape was not strong enough.
B000CQ482I|5|Extremely simple to use. I found instructions online, but would recommend finding forums that discuss the full extent of what you need to be thinking about when installing a V8 into a 6 cylinder produced car. Great product! Looks great too
B004A6O8YO|5|Great
B00IN5X2P4|5|The cargo liner fits my 2015 Toyota Highlander perfectly and is just as advertized. I am sure it will be in the vehicle when I decide to trade it in or sell it.
B00XYCFJPC|1|Junk stopped working after two weeks! Don't waste your money 0 stars!
B00CIJ3T1S|5|I love my kayak sticker
B005QCD6V2|2|Solo tiene letras por un solo lado
B000COV00I|5|Great product
B000CMHVGM|5|Life saver, new trailer plugs coming with 5 pins vs 4 old style
B008J9XML8|1|Bought these 8 months ago. Mounting them was easy but now one of them has lost the black and is now a bronze color which would be fine except the other one is still black and now they look odd.
B008E5XIJ8|5|Keychain is very well made . Infiniti emblem is heavy and does look very classy .
B000BKC25K|5|Perfect product
B00CJUW3HW|5|I got a different TARDIS sticker, mine is the new logo the WD TARDIS logo, still awesome.About the size of photo graph, goes on super easy
B008W11DWI|5|Fit like a glove. Top quality welds and materials. Very heavy duty flanges.  Be sure to longate the bolt holes if installing on a header with larger then stock mounting bolts
B000C6MLIQ|5|Great - thanks..
B00PF5PHWG|5|Happy with it
B00LEBLI82|5|These LEDs were as bright as my old incandescent bulbs with a lot less heat and much less power drain.
B008X72XV6|4|Didn't last through winter but the seller sent me a new one at no charge.  Will hope for this one to last longer.
B000CI1Y2I|5|Outstanding, I'll buy from him again.
B003YK96YO|5|was easy to install and works really well; better than I'd expected. only thing is that when retracted, it hits the bumper pretty hard from the spring tension.
B000JFHNEC|5|as described
B0013FSR7E|4|It came on time. It fits my vehicle. it world well.  I give it 5 stars.
B0001EFSTI|4|Got this mainly for the bottle opener function, but it is VERY hard to use.. there is little grip and I had to go through multiple spots on the cap for it to come off. Other than that, the size and functionality of this is quite good.
B00B7A375C|5|These Fit quickly, easily, and flawlessly to my 2009 r6s.
B00CKYH0IO|4|The mount was a prefect match.  Quality appeared to be as expected.
B000XQI3EQ|5|Perfect going to get it installed tomorrow!!!! 
B00JA80PEO|2|For the price it needs to perform. These might be alright for workout headphones but when you put them on in mc full face helmet, good luck hearing the music. Microphone takes up too much real estate and speakers are weak to stay in place. Installed two separate systems on two different full face helmets and my issues were present on both. Not impressed.
B00EPDLYTO|1|Rusted quickly.
B000CSGWZC|5|Great plug. Bike runs like a champ.
B00541775Q|5|Great product and fit my 2013 Pilot perfectly.
B00J9TZBBQ|5|Good quality, exactly what I was expecting.  Fits my large grill with ease and keeps it dry and clean
B00606NJ0G|5|Fit is perfect for my 2015 Sonic LTZ Hatchback. Works well in keeping the heat buildup down as well as protecting the dash area from the damaging rays of the sun. You can tell this sunshade was specifically made to fit my Sonic vs. those one-size fits all ones. The only drawback to this shade is that when rolled up and not in use it definitely occupies some space, but that does not out weigh the benefits it provides. The shade is well constructed and should serve a long life of protection. I highly recommend it.
B000AU45CY|5|Just what we needed to revive our boat trailer. Good product.
B000TYHQ18|5|:)
B000E24APU|4|I was happy with this product. It worked as well as I wanted it to, though not perfectly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the final step doesn't work very well. The only type of repair I could see the last step working (where you apply the texturing paper to the colored paste so it looks more like leather than glue) is if the area you're repairing is completely flat so it can completely adhere. In my case the repair was a challenging one, a 6-inch tear along a cushion seam. The patching fabric was enough to cover the tear, cut in 3 strips. The seam has a lot of folds so the texturing paper just wasn't flexible enough to fit the contours, so the repair ended up looking somewhat lumpy. One more thing, this &#34;no heat&#34; process looks like it was a lot easier than the other products that require heat treatments.
B0026M9DZS|5|The sway bar itself is beyond excellent. The end link bushings / bolts are excellent. Everything is excellent except the rubber mount bushings. Chuck those and get some blue Moogs. Installing the subframe will require more jack and muscle if you have it completely off. The vehicle will surely handle like a dream after your finished - providing all else is well and you use the Moog bushings. Amazing! I'm a GM Tech. of 16 years. I'd rather have this than something form our parts department. Sometimes OEM isn't all that great or cars would be great.
B002PYBZJO|5|definitely helps me identify what the lights that come up on my car mean. This was a good investment!
B00QL6OXSW|5|Grate stuff
B00C7S9K8Q|5|This is an awesome bar for the rough country TJ hood mount.  I installed them on the same 40a relay as my 18w LED cubes which I installed on the window mounts.  The bar is heavy, well designed and seems to be built to last.<br /><br />Everything arrived quickly and well packaged.  Couldn't ask for a better sale.
B00J2PL5K8|3|They look good but one of my lights flickers and the fact the bulb is not hidden.
B00M9EYYNO|5|Very heavy duty, nice and wide and well built. All around great product. Great for lifted trucks, very happy with my purchase..would recommend, only drawback is they need better delivery options, had to wait a week to get mine. Other than that they are worth every dollar.
B001O25GA2|4|good one shot extinguisher
B00DILTFP4|4|Wipers for me are somewhat hard to distinguish between one brand or the other and in many cases I will go with the lower priced or a better brand if it is on sale.  Perhaps my windshield is less curved than other vehicles?  With my cars being in Florida, they are constantly exposed to the severe effects of the sun and various types of bugs,etc in their lifetime.  In my experience, the blades never seem to last long enough to get to the chatter stage of wear, but that of small patterns of streaking from grit or abrasions.  Supposedly you should change them every 6-12 months, but it seems like I have to do it about every 4 months.  I have yet to reach that point with these wiper blades, but so far they have not done anything to let me down.  I will change their rating higher (or lower) depending on how long they last in comparison to others I had tried.  Also, when the product description highlights their easy installation, I have yet to come across one that is difficult when using the near universal hook clip, as the hardest part usually comes when blades won't release easily after a particularly harsh season.
B00LG07MZE|5|all I can say is excellent customer service from this seller.<br />They go above and beyond. If you have a issue, no questions asked. Great seller.<br />Item worked, I just got confused by the photos. Item is loose around the edges, not wired, just the inside circles. But great for over large windshields.
B000NU5LP6|5|Needed this stuff and the price on Amazon was great. No issues with the product, aside from the smell of course.
B004J7B8L0|5|Perfect fit. Seems same quality as OEM.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Overall im happy with product, very easy to place and sufficient coverage and it comes with 2 so i have one for the other side window. Delivery was prompt no probs!
B000JIND4S|3|It is easy for a car thief to remove this:  Cut a slot in the steering wheel.  The metal under the rubber grip is thin.  Takes less then a few seconds with a bolt cutter.  Of course the steering wheel is damaged but most thieves are looking for other parts.  That said, this product does keep the casual &#34;joy rider&#34; from taking your car.
B000CGVSHG|5|Fit better than the OEM one and MUCH cheaper. Fit on my mustang gt on the hydro boost to rack line came with all parts needed and didn't have a flare nut like the oem
B000EDUTWM|3|Thought I'd see if the white double sided foam tape has gotten better over the years. It hasn't! Box itself is nice but scrape the tape off and mount with screws. Check your hardware store for these corner mounts.
B00GODGN9E|5|This is our 3rd CTEK charger, and we love all of them. It definitely help maintain the battery life of our often idle car. This was originally recommended by our Porsche technician as a cheaper alternative to the Porsche-brand charger. The Porsche charger looks pretty much the same but arguably this one works better as it has more functionality (more stages) and of course the extra testing feature.<br /><br />In my opinion though, the extra testing feature is useful, but only marginally because you'd rarely use it. Hence, it is probably worth $10-20 more than the CTEK MUS 4.3 regular, but not more than that.
B00E1ETJNU|5|looks great and adds to the black and blue theme i got going on the outside of the car
B00P2D3VZG|5|great bulbs. highly recommended. 👍🏼👍🏼
B00LTX81B2|5|Good to have at home.
B00RGZWIW0|5|It's been real solid so far....fit's well and has kept things organized.  Recommended.
B00HZ873UA|5|Awesome! Ordered a 3842 for my 05 ram<br />Hemi and you can tell a world of difference! Must buy, easy to operate. Diagnostic code reader is great also! I reccomend!
B0002Q7BZE|5|2003 GMC Sonoma worked great. Easy to install.
B00X09K07Q|1|Side Marker and Turn Signal wires were manufactured reversely! The brighter one response to my side marker and the darker response to my turn signal. After I turn on the side marker, there is no response to my turn signal at all
B005HAYDR4|5|Great price and appearance
B0058VF7KO|5|Definitely make my truck stand out!
B001ADA26S|5|The unit fits well and installs in a matter of minutes!  It is shaped to accomdate the factory installed subwoofer. It holds a fair amount of gear, and gives secure storage to the items.
B004AIHKT2|5|It worked great on my Chrysler 300 Touring. 2007. I did the work myself and after 2 hours it's working like New.
B0055EK3JO|3|I would not buy these again.  They add a little extra to the car, but are very flimsy. This is one time I should have headed to other reviewers reviews.
B00OWPRW64|5|like discribed
B004W0QJ9K|3|ok but these are kind of small so please know that before your buy them. That being said they work fine on the door of my F150 arm rest
B00NUB3DZK|2|I bought a used truck, my intention was to use the little round lights for step illumination and the other step lights as puddle lamps below the steps to illuminate the ground, i might incorporate them somehow, however they are a lot less brighter than i was hoping. At the same time i purchased the 3/4 rounds i also purchased some 3/4 round RED lights that when illuminated are like lazers that were manufactured by Tec Niq where the clear ones were not. When reading about the light mfg. Tec Neq does state they were the 1st to develope that style of light, so that may mean the knock offs dont see the same appreciation for a equil product. By trade i am a mechanic so in my travels i will use the clear ones in a project somewhere but for what i was wanting them for i only rated them with two stars👎
B005E3AWJW|5|Took a couple tries to program but worked perfectly
B000GBIQ5O|5|Perfect fit and totally worth the money spent.
B00KTJ993Q|5|Excelent
B007IUYEFC|5|beautiful little horse shoes!! arrived fast exactly as pictured
B00BD62X9Q|5|Adding trailer lights to a Toyota RAV4 couldn't be easier. Easy install and I recommend checking youtube and watch the video install makes the install that much easier.
B00SJXE9R0|4|Grate
B007ANWAO4|5|Love it!! Great fit
B007PKJUKO|5|I used this carb on an 88cc crf50 so I had to adjust it some which I fully expected.  The carb works great though! Starts 1st kick.  I would imagine if it was stock displacement that it would have fired on the 1st kick,
B003WDDLTO|5|Handy way to add a quick-connect to a motorcycle battery for charging.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Received fast, Applied to my car -- works as advertised as stated in the detailed reviews.
B00DGZD6VQ|5|Good Buy. You can add a whole lot of keys in this.
B0042XORMI|4|I just got this last week so your mileage may vary with your experience.<br />These fuses seem to be just as good as their more expensive but better labeled fuses. What do I mean by that? My other fuses I had have a more visible coloring for the fuse number on the tops of each fuse. You could argue that they are color coded but not all the colors are the same as my other fuses. I'll update if these fuses don't hold up but for the price, quantity,  and quality so far. They're a very good replacement if you,  yanno,  don't mind the little inconvenience of the numbering.
B00062ZDAO|4|I like them but the only downside its they look a little little low quality but obviously they work.<br />If you want your engine to look better on a budget this is your item.
B00RSQBTUO|3|Not much like the OEM part, the foot surface is not solid, I'm not sure I'd recommend this to anyone...even if the OEM part is much more expensive.
B00EDFM83A|3|I purchased these to use in my rv they are not as bright as the 921 bulbs I plan to use them in landscape lights instead
B000CCOL3I|4|Good stuff for Direct Injection Engines.
B00JAEL5RE|4|Slow shipping but good product
B00CF767HQ|5|Perfect fit thank you.
B00MN7AIGE|1|Does not work.... I purchased this for my 2015 scion tc and it does not work...the lights turn one color and the remote doesn't change the color or anything at that.....do yourself a favor and buy something that's a little more trust me you'll be a lot happier
B00B8TZ1O2|1|First off, it didn't fit my window, not even the square part of it. Second, you cannot see through these. If you put it up, you might as well just black out your back windows so good luck looming out them while driving, which is unsafe. Third, its so hard to get all the bubbles out or for this to even go on straight probably since it comes rolled up tight. The characters are cute though, that's the only good part of this product. I should've used my $7 for something more useful.
B003JIMN0U|5|love it!
B0000AZ7WJ|5|worked out great, and great price and fast shipping
B009LQFVUI|5|Excellent
B00FELPN0W|1|This &#34;bumper sticker&#34; is smaller than a post-it note. Even if you rear-ended me you wouldn't be able to read it. Would work as a laptop sticker, but not as a bumper sticker.
B00CI6HYOO|5|You can't beat OEM spark plug sets. THEY FIT precisely as the car was when it was made and the quality is unquestionable normally.
B00J15J9XO|1|One less south african in america ..good ridance
B000NW6X24|5|Came in AC Delco packaging and works great.  It was one of 3 parts I needed to fix the secondary air system on my 05 Trailblazer (the other parts being AC Delco 214-2222 [air injection valve] and AC Delco 219-351 [air injection valve gasket].<br /><br />I did not have to replace part AC Delco 215-454 [secondary air pump] and you may need all or none of these parts to fix your Trailblazer.  Be sure to do appropriate troubleshooting to determine what you need.
B00DWKWSTG|4|One of the best HID Ballest I have used. Product plugs right in for easy install and very quick..<br />Delivers awesome power to HID bulbs, fast and smooth ignition of element.  No flickers or hesitation!!!!!!
B0002MB80C|4|Comfortable cover that was easy to put on, and doesn't shift easily with use. It looks stylish. The stitching has come apart a little where I place my hands, but that isn't a big deal. Because it is black, it can get very hot from the sun, so be careful.
B00CLFZSGS|5|So glad to finally have one of these for my vehicle!  At the perfect size, it's not noticeable (exactly as it should, or should not, be) except to those who know what it represents.  I only wish I'd thought to make a template first, because it's slightly off from where I wanted.
B00RVUFNH2|4|I ended up only using the grill S-Line piece but it fits and looks great! The clips that come with it are silver and should be black but a little spray paint solved that
B000BIYN3Q|5|great price and quality
B00C4XFMO0|5|One of the few A/C recharging refrigerant cans that don't seem to contain the &#34;stop-leak&#34; product/chemical that can cause more damage then good in the car.<br /><br />Worked great in the two cars I used it in.
B009DJS79U|5|Enjoy your purchase
B001RM6WV6|5|Works as intended.
B00X2TUW1I|5|Purchased the larger size of these sun shades for my 2012 Nissan Rogue and they are perfect. They definitely help cool the inside of the car and have been removed and replaced several times without any problems. Nice to have to help keep the kids cooler.
B0027UPPK6|5|Worked
B00K2CUQYG|5|Excelente
B000C42SKY|5|Works like the original.
B006QMIJKY|2|Works great but was shipped without the clips so it does not go up when the trunk opens.
B007JMOTJK|5|Fits badlands 12,000 lbs winch like a glove
B0041QN6SW|5|Fits my 2014 HD Ultra Classic like a glove, look great, more chrome to keep clean.
B003YMTJ9O|5|Works great for our 1995 wrangler!
B005I4PPSU|5|It was in good package. Wasn't cheap material.
B00SRF68QU|5|Nice addition to my Jeep and it actually serves a purpose. I have knee problems and this is very useful during long drives. Definitely recommend this item to all the Jeep troopers out there! DON'T WAIT.....get it now!!!
B008G23DDU|4|Maybe not the fit and finish of OE but very good for alot cheaper and they do look good.
B00VQUXXWA|4|Great size. Serve it's purpose. but the suction may need improvement. but overall great product.. fast shipping.
B007USCM7E|5|Worked as described. The enclosed instructions and you tube video directions are easy to follow and my a/c is working perfectly again.
B00BYH6C1E|4|excellent product, worth every penny!! treat yourself to this
B00B4E9S9A|4|The size is correct, the font is correct. It was delivered in a timely manner. The emblems are plastic and came in a GM package. I would have thought OEM emblems would have been metal.
B008KO79Z2|3|Decent looking helmet, but it kinda starts falling apart after a few months of using it.<br />Like today one of the visor screws just fell out.<br />Other than that, I am happy with it.
B003LITDQA|5|Super!
B00OFRUWF2|5|Good product, meet expectations and delivery was on time<br />Thank you
B00KTMMQJM|5|The kids love it. The tires are wide enough to give it some stability and it is loved and I mean loved by the 6 year old grandson.
B00MXGROV2|5|Easy installation, quality steps for under $200 dollars and fast shipment.  First-rate experience!
B00NPIUFMM|4|These are supposed to be drop in replacements for a 3157 Dual filament bulb. They are not. On my Jeep Wrangler 2000 there is virtually no difference in the light intensity between the Running light (dim in theory) and the Turn Signal mode. What I did to &#34;fix&#34; this was to add a 35 Ohm 5 watt (1%) resistor in Series with the wire that feeds the Running light filament contact, for each front light. This brought the light level down to slightly brighter than the stock incandescent 3157 bulb, Now there is a HUGE attention-getting difference between the Running and Turn. I went with a white LED to get the brightest light, and the color is a nice Yellow with the existing lens/light cover. So I took off a star for the extra hassle of having to determining the right resistor value. ordering on Ebay and installing, but the end result is truly amazing. I used a EP26 Flasher module that is made for the Wrangler TJ series and it produces a standard flash rate that wont get you pulled over by the fuzz.
B00R1J5O2M|5|I installed these on my bumper and hooked them to a pump wired to a pushbutton switch on my dashboard.<br /><br />Now, when someone is tailgating me on the highway all I've gotta do is push a button and they back way off!
B009FUF6DM|5|These are wonderful -- I confess I &#34;subscribe&#34; to them and use them for the dirtier, greasier cleanups and then toss them rather than wash them. But when I was caring for my ill husband, the color-coding helped with bathing and I washed them then. Just don't use bleach, wash blue with blue, etc, don't wash with anything else. My well-meaning son washed them all together with bleach, and their &#34;magnetic&#34; slightly antiseptic qualities were ruined!
B00FP0LHA2|5|Initially had a problem with the 3 cables that I ordered. Requested a return. Got response from Ann Hymel and she was very sincere in ensuring that I was happy as a customer. She sent me replacement and it's all perfectly working now. Would have been one of the irate customer but Ann handled this perfectly and professionally. Highly recommended! Great deal considering the price and excellent customer service!
B0009JKGKQ|5|Great stuff, would buy again.
B003WDEYPE|5|This works great for a Deltran battery tender plus.  It costs a fraction of what Deltran wants for exactly the same thing.  There is nothing special needed.  Both use the same SAE type connector attached to a length of 18 gauge wire.<br /><br />My battery tender flashes the green and red lights sometimes when the battery is disconnected when using this cord.  No cause for alarm, the battery tender is simply being confused by the electrical interference the long length of cord is picking up like an antenna. The cord is not defective. Simply unplug the battery tender if it bothers you.
B00R8MS6PY|2|The ends are correct and work, but cable is much too long and hangs up on brush etc.  This is just a generic brake cable, not specific to my bike.
B00DBENUQS|1|does not fit
B00721HWY2|3|False name.  They should advertise the correct name to this sunglass.  THey are Kick Back Freedom. 2 different glasses.  But they work.
B001CZB6M8|1|The leather plunger does not form a good seal, only creates 45 psi. A new one should get upto 140 psi.
B000E35VMA|5|Perfect fit and looks just as good as the OEM part.  This one goes from the bottom port of the radiator to the auxiliary transmission cooler.
B007VXCYOO|1|Anode and cathode was backwards on the plug. Led lights are polarity sensitive.
B00VFXYAEI|1|Had it on my pickup for 2 months then water for inside and destroyed it. Only used it a dozen times.
B005GSK0OC|5|Nice googles.
B00Z80KDWC|5|Perfect fit for my 1999 SAAB 9-3 turbo manual transmission. All the mounts for the oil cooler, inter-cooler, ac condenser and fan lined up perfectly. Be prepared for a solid day of work to install the radiator. The bumper cover and bumper have to come off to unbolt the oil cooler, inter-cooler and ac condenser. Use milk crates to suspend the oil cooler and condenser. The battery has to be removed and the upper power steering line has to be unbolted. Use bungee cords to pull the steering line away enough to sneak the fan shroud out. There are a few more wires mounted to the radiator the need to be removed. After that, the radiator pulls up and out. The only extra parts were new clamps for the inter-cooler hoses and new screws to bolt everything back together.
B000CF6S3Q|5|EZ install.  Looks great.  Keeps water out and allows us to keep window open to let air in or heat out.
B0116GZP1A|5|I was on the hunt for one of these for a project motorcycle I've been working on. One of the features that I wanted to incorporate was a way to charge my phone (which I also use as a GPS) when I go on long rides. This little kit came with a mountable housing and quick disconnect wires. This didn't come with a manual so I'll just throw it out there that red is positive and black is negative, but you might already know that if you are looking for one of these. I was able to get this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion, but honestly I would've gotten this one anyways. I must also note that the build quality of this is actually pretty good for the price it's being offered for.
B005UGJUAK|5|These pipes are excellent! They were delivered fast and real easy to install. Never changed pipes before, but with the instructions that came with the package made installation real simple. The sound is better than I hoped for. Now people hear me coming on the road. Highly recommend if you're looking for some pipes to give your bike some real deep throat and a loud sound.
B002XJNQSY|5|easy to put on
B001CEJH0W|5|Perfect fit in my 06 Tacoma, Keeps the cabin air as clean as it can be when off road.
B00P3FU4EY|5|Note: This is a OEM Toyota product that does need a rivet gun from Home Depot or Amazon. Easy to install
B00L8FN5D0|5|Great mirrors for my 2014 fz6r. Better than stock. They sit lower and add style. Easy install. Love em.
B00KTJ0EA8|2|Received this product quick, however it broke it two weeks. Big waste!!
B005HFYE1O|5|So far I have installed 3 of these relays and everything is working perfectly.  I am relying on these to run the off-road lights on my 04 TJ.
B003AT6EYO|5|this is a good price for a good receiver
B001Z5U3H4|5|Well made.  Good fit
B00TQ07IOQ|2|They don't stay in place and they're curling in the heat. I went too cheap.
B000LG8GI6|5|My key fob came with instructions that worked like a charm for my 2002 Camry! Perfect buy to replace my old broken fob.
B00480BVXS|5|The Camco 42150 Flying Insect Screen does what it is intended to do.
B00KX0SDBA|1|What was pictures and described was not what I received. I payed over $40 and received the $12 7piece BMW decal set. Was not carbon fiber or even replica.
B00L9CQPNO|2|Well they looked great when I first got them. The mirror part itself is made of plastic.. the reflection is distorted slightly. The blue faded completely in one half a day ride.. they don't adjust well...
B00075XCV2|4|Installation was a bit of a drag, but not the hitch's fault.  Weld nuts on the 2000 Jeep Cherokee I mounted it to needed tapped.  After that, it went on fairly easy.  Fit perfect, though a bit tight around the exhaust pipe.
B0038YGUN6|5|This screen fit perfectly.
B00SZZKU02|5|The GOOFIT 100cc Big Bore Performance Kit turned out to be an amazing kit for fixing my scooter issues. The parts are quality made and they offer easy installation. Overall, it is a good performance kit with a very reasonable price and I am totally impressed with its quality.
B00THH9I7I|5|Excelent. Simple use
B00TA60BJA|5|The fender is a heavy gauge steel and very easy to weld. Very little prep was needed before painting. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B005J43I56|5|Perfect fit, just what was needed.
B002XMSB5O|4|good
B003STUY8I|5|it is exactly what I was looking for
B000EQR5YE|5|happy  happy
B00PXN494W|1|Very poor quality, full of scratches
B0007XQ3CE|5|Works nice.
B000CSD65Q|5|just as described also a motorcycle not listed as compatible is the yamaha v star 250 or yamaha v star xv250 (2013) but i hear those bikes were the same for a very long time mechanically. its very easy job to do on your own just make sure spark plug wires are securely attached to the plug before starting hope this helps someone
B00M0443ZW|5|Very bright.
B00GLLW3AM|5|Very good illumination and very well made.
B0069TQL54|5|Good the best
B00IV6YSSK|5|Awesome for the price, even though it isn't dot. Looks nice.
B000IYNVTA|3|This item has solved a ongoing problem with not getting cool air while both driving and while at a stop. However, it operates fairly rough and can feel it shaking when being used. I think it is a bit off balance and the weights could be off a bit. Being able to drive when it  is over 100 degrees out and 60 degrees inside, it is something I can over look for the time.
B00666GNXA|5|:)
B006LGKHIM|2|Be aware that this item is shipped from China.<br />A standard water bottle fits very loosely in this holder.  If you are riding at high speeds or on a bumpy ride you will probably drop your water bottle!
B004HE56EU|5|great pads for the price.  fit a 2005 Hyundai Tuscon as intended.
B00P6UTAQ4|4|It looks great. My 2001 RAM 2500 V10 comes with a factory lift in the back. Making the front seem to sag....These may have been a little difficult to install but when the job was finished my truck was only a quarter inch lower in the front. She looks great.
B00SKODWBM|4|There were some minor fit issues but all in all a great product and great look on the truck.
B00O83FKTQ|5|Great product very easy to install
B000BGM89Y|5|We have an older camper and this suited our needs perfectly for the two of us.  We were able to wash dishes and takes showers without worrying about running out of water for four days.
B00144BIC0|5|Very easy install. Make sure truck stand out
B00FY90MH8|3|Twice the size of a postage stamp!  Not happy with this product for the money.  $3.99 for three little flag stickers!!!!!  I read the dimensions, so I knew what I was getting.  The final product is well made and sticks well to my welding helmet.  But I'm just not satisfied...will not recommend.  These vinyl stickers, I feel, are over priced.  My fault...not the seller.
B002N4MAM2|3|These wipers work well enough and are extremely cheap! Besides that they also tub and drag enough on the windshield to make a repetitive annoying noise while in use. A great buy for a vehicle you don't drive much or need to use for long drives.
B00AMUI3E8|4|The instructions provided with this are a bit wrong. A least a template that was provided to show where to drill into your bed was wrong. One was ok but the other was too short. I drilled an unnecessary hole in my bed. Otherwise not a hard unit to install and looks good. Just ticked about the instructions.
B00KLSZ632|4|Installed 6/25/2015. They look good. Fit was perfect, a simple plug and play. These were the best switchbacks I've tried. The white is very bright and has a clean crisp with color without any hint of blue. They actually add to the lighting power of my headlights. The amber is, well amber. My truck requires four bulbs in the front and the colors were identical. They did require load resisters, (remember, one resister per bulb). The functions are flawless.   The reason for the four stars was due to the amber being not as bright as the white.Maybe 30% dimmer. FYI: I have not contacted the vendor due to the fact that they all work and the intensities are exactly the same with the four bulbs. I do like them. [Search You Tube for &#34;2011 SILVERADO JDM ASTAR LED&#34; to see how they look in use]  Today, they have been in my truck for approximately six weeks. I will write a follow up when they fail and hopefully wont be for a couple of years. The pictures I've included were the best my &#34;Cheapo Deluxe&#34; camera could do
B00G6ENGXW|4|Fit perfectly
B00GE9Y5IE|5|Easy installation, minutes not hours
B001UKOGLS|2|The rear covers are a freaking nightmare even with the instructional video
B00F0SL4P2|5|Perfect replacement.
B0026N55MW|5|What can one say about a piece of plastic...it does the job at a great price.  I like the way that it is fool proof, myself not being a mechanic, it can only go on one way, so even I couldn't mess it up.  It fit perfectly on my Geo Metro and now it runs great.
B0016HNPNU|5|Worked great.
B005JVPI4S|5|First of all, the pictures are not the described product, what you get will look very different.  Perhaps they will realize this and correct it, there are folks out there who get all bent over mistakes like this.  Now, about the Steeda CAI for the Mustang V6, this mod will make your six banger scream.  Granted, the late model V6 engine is no slouch, but there is room for improvement and this intake provides the most bang for the buck.  Be advised though, a custom Steeda tune is MANDATORY!  Strategy tunes built in on SCT, Diablosport and other brand tuners do not provide a proper set up for this free breathing intake.  Your engine will run too lean and you will end up buying a new motor, you don't want to do that.  That being said, if you expect to achieve an improvement in gas mileage  you will be disappointed with the Steeda.  If that is what you're looking for, you need to be looking at the K&N or the AIRAID products and a tuner (SCT or Diablosport), you will get a noticeable improvement in performance & mileage.  However, if what you want is 'throw you back in the seat acceleration', if what you want is the beginning of a 227 cubic inch Monster, then this STEEDA Cold Air Intake, along with the STEEDA custom tune using either tuner is the ONLY one that will take you there.  If you take it easy around town, you may manage keep your gas mileage about the same as you had while driving  aggressively; driving it easy is not as disappointing as it would seem, you can still feel the muscle, oh and the difference in the sound of your Pony is very sweet.  Should you continue to drive it aggressively, you will come to experience, 'The Grin That Never Dies', who cares about gas mileage anyway.  BTW, you do need to use Premium Fuel, 91 to 93 octane.  You can find the STEEDA POWER PACK which gets you this intake, an SCT X4 tuner AND a Steeda custom tune at a substantial discount over buying them separately.  Installation is pretty simple and can be completed by one person in an hour or two.  An extra set of hands can be helpful during assembly of the new intake, but is not a requirement; I am 62 and have some mobility impairment; working alone, I completed the installation, including the tune in about two hours. My 'Stang is a 2014 V6 Coupe, factory stock except for this Steeda upgrade, over the next year I will be adding BBK Shorty Headers, BBK 73mm Throttle Body, Ford Racing Touring Axle-back Mufflers and a Ford Racing X-pipe, then I intend to take it out to Royal Purple Raceway and see what she will do in the 1/4 mile.  I think I have covered just about everything in my review, but just in case you didn't get my point, here it is: GET THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN, YOU WILL :-) A LOT!!
B007524XBI|4|Exceptional fit on my 2015 Sonic LTZ Hatchback. Easily installed and looks good. This hood guard will only protect the very forward edge of the hood from chips but does nothing to deflect the debri from the rest of the hood. The aerodynamics of this guard does not allow for a upper flow of air over the guard to re-direct debri from the hood or windshield.
B00NSEMQR0|5|Fits great and looks good
B00C5S5NY8|4|Good product and easy to install with spring coil assembly set.
B00CJGNMXA|4|I'd recommend this grille.  I like the aftermarket lights you can get for S10s/Blazers but I like the more open grill of the Sonomas/Jimmys.  This grill means I get the lights I want and sort of the look of the Sonoma/Jimmy grill.<br /><br />Pros: Good looks; seems just as tough as the original grill; for the most part, the tolerances are within check so the lights fit well enough.  I did use aftermarket lights though.<br />Cons: The metal clips used to attach the grill to the truck were a little hard to put back on this grill in some places.  Like I said, the tolerances are pretty good but not perfect.
B001C6JC6O|2|incorrect axle for a 4runner.  Only has 5 lug holes instead of six.  shipping and packaging was excellent though.
B00DT42TRQ|1|The silencer didn't fit right, and it's too loud without it. It rattles all the time and sounds like s***. If you like your car, don't buy this. Just save up and get something quality..
B00AKA9XVW|5|Exactly what you are expecting. Great cover.
B00CAJ6O4A|1|MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE YOUR EXISTING ANTENNA AGAINST THIS ANTENNA.
B008Y41LUM|5|Perfect fit for my tomberlin crossfire 150cc
B0006IX87S|5|Works great!
B00GYIXXVU|1|Sent it back.  Too big and bulky for my need.  For ANY need it doesn't need to be that big and bulky.
B003BSB7PU|5|Used it for the first time in my RV gray tank.  Totally eliminated the odor rising from the sink, and dumping the tank was not a disgusting process.<br />This will be my go to product from now on!
B003CJEJIU|5|There really nice looking. A little pricey with real carbon fiber sleeves as decorative parts that go around the Sliders
B00OD43NMQ|5|This cover is great fits perfectly and nice embroidery will definitely look at this company again
B009X1XDZG|1|does NOT fit this truck
B00FV1MLUA|4|They look great on my truck. I love the in channel design. No problems with the install or window function. They could be packaged better. There were some marks from where the items touched each other. A little cleaner wax took care of it.
B007ZDDUCK|5|I have a white Kate spade purse and wallet that I stopped using because they were really dirty and hard to clean...until using this stuff. In less than 15 minutes, both were bright white. I previously used saddle soap, but the leather still had a dingy look afterwards.  But with this leather cleaner, the dirt easily wiped away. Plus, it didn't darken the white, soft leather. My purse and wallet look brand new again.
B00T2GT9L4|5|Worked like a charm. I've tried it on a Toyota Corolla 2006 5 stars .
B0000AY4YT|5|This product worked GREAT!  Used on an old boat and it really improved the look of the oxidized paint.  IMPRESSIVE PRODUCT!!!!
B000V7W4E2|5|Good product will be ordering more next week
B00R1J5G3E|3|Good product good price didn't fit my vehicle
B005TC5QUS|5|well made and not too small.
B0057I3TVW|5|works great and much less $$ then OEM
B003VAZ6OG|5|work great more channels
B00C7PTMFU|5|Perfect fit on a 1972 Chevy K-20 pickup w/ TH350 transmission.
B000CHKUJ2|5|Matched original perfectly.
B008R096FA|5|Good size and good reception
B000AL8VD2|5|Great
B009XQHTP6|5|The 90 Degree locking valve stem connector along with the capability to inflate or deflate makes this tool very handy for maintaining air pressures on motorcycle tire's that have minimal room to access valve stems.
B00BMZU90I|2|BEWARE!!! Just by dumb luck I noticed a hole in one of the welds! It was where the pipe is welded to the flat piece that bolts to the head. Luckily I have a welder and was able to fix it myself.  Also, the two holes that fit on the studs in the head, were off just enough to make a really tight fit. Tight enough that I had to persuade the header on with a hammer.
B00FALW192|5|These compounds are great. You have to know how to use and which application to use. If not v38 does it all and is smooth. Will post pictures of car do ya can see the results. Best results when used with bufx102hex. It goes hand in hand. Recommended highly. A must have
B003CJ95V6|5|This filter works great.
B004P3TN7Y|5|Thanks for all.
B00U6G97J8|1|Didnt fit my grille at all wast of money threw them in the trash
B005ADY8V4|5|love it
B008Y7Z664|5|I have a 13 year old vehicle and an 11 year old sheltie. So I had a previous license plate holder for 11 years.  Last week I had my vehicle detailed and wanted to get a new holder that was not faded.  This arrived quickly and is very nice.  As a bonus, it matches the color of my CRV better than the previous one I had did.
B000C9TBUE|1|Incorrect fit for my vehicle. Amazon garage said it fit but it did not.
B009DJNNR6|4|Fit perfectly but the color was not exactly like the original.
B00CT2Y8IC|5|Fit perfectly on my Geo Metro.  Great price on a new air filter.
B006V7TBBA|2|Decent enough lights.  The on/off switch was bad. Went to an auto-parts store and got a new one for $5.00, hence the two stars.
B005CNN5IY|4|Bought to use with 2014 FJ Cruiser, the twist locks did not fit properly and therefore the liners would not stay flat and tended to move around, contacted Husky Liners directly and they were very responsive.<br />After a couple of emails back and forth they quickly sent out a replacement that fit properly and a pickup tag to return the defective ones.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether they were defective or Amazon misguided me by saying they fit but I'm really happy with the replacements and with the company Husky as a whole!
B00NLMD2H2|2|Said it would fit a 2012 Camaro, but the side mirror covers are in the wrong location.
B0024E6W02|5|Excellent product well made does the job no leaking at connections
B00FP0G5EK|5|Easily installed and works good
B0027QWNI2|2|Cheap but functional.
B005ESER7U|5|verry good
B000LQG4OO|5|Work's  great
B000EDOSKQ|3|A OK
B00VF4CKXK|5|So happy to have this great decal!<br />Kudos to Yoonek Graphics: My first decal was damaged. They replaced it promptly, at no cost. I am beyond thrilled. With such wonderful customer service, they have found a customer for life!
B008WF0TBK|4|Looks good on my modified 2015 Stingray
B00ARJPKGS|5|Great price. Good quality. Fast delivery.
B0058TVYSK|4|There are holes inside it, make sure you silicone them shut before believing it's water proof
B000182EVE|5|works really well keeping rain out. stuck really well. easy install!
