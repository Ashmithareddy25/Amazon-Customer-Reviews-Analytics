B000GTTW90|5|I purchased this XXL Falcon Cover for my 2010 Road King Classic that has a Memphis Shades Fairing and 12&#34; Long Ride Shields Windshield. Cover fits perfectly, leaving only the tiniest bit of front tire showing when tucked in for the night. With the fairing removed it covers the whole bike with room to spare. There are 2 straps that you can use to secure the cover under the bike, and between those and the elastic bottom the cover didn't flap...even during a crazy dust storm in New Mexico with winds up to 55 mph!<br /><br />I was skeptical about the compression bag that it all packs back into, but it's actually very easy to figure out. It packs down to about the size of a Folgers can (the big one) and fits in my saddlebag, only taking up about 1/2 the space!<br /><br />The cover is vented so you can cover your ride before it's 100% cooled down. Vents also prevent any moisture from building up inside the cover.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying one of these covers!
B0017OANWI|3|I bought these a few weeks ago to make my lights appear more white without converting to HID. So far they haven't burned out. They're not as bright as my old ones. But they do appear more white than normal halogen headlights. If you're buying for the color, I would recommend spending a little extra for HID conversion kit
B00C2WKZRC|5|This is a low cost IC, so I did not have very high expectations for it. I was very surprised when it arrived. Well constructed, good material, nice welds, no damage, except a few surface scratches. Overall it is very good for my application!
B0024ECDL4|4|Use every time we camp. Black ring hard to turn with wet hands
B000BZZPCC|1|Nice rotors, very pleased with appearance and perception of quality.  Fit the bolt pattern, etc, but are far too thick for 2009 Honda Accord 4cyl brake calipers (I'd estimate 1/4&#34; too thick).  After discovering this during install and doing some more research, I think Centric Parts 120.40036 is the correct part number for 2009 Honda Accords.
B005NLQAHS|5|Great product havent had any issues with it yet
B00HVPX12G|5|Great price
B001AQD89S|1|Ballast did not last even a couple of nights; one bulb started flashing the second night and it is not longer turning on. I would not recommend anybody to purchase this product. No issues in regards to return my money, however that is not exactly what I was planning when I purchased the kit.
B0017T7WHW|5|Very strong.... Take care on its opperation. You must remember to buy other thing like Hi-Lift jack ORB Off-Road Base and Hi-Lift Jack HK-B Black Handle-Keeper.
B000CSIRXW|5|Does the job very well for a replacement plug very good purchase.
B003YNYCJ0|5|perfect fit on 06 Mazda 3 Sport
B006FR2C12|5|Compared to crg mirrors these work just as well. One crg is approx $65. These were half the price of one for the pair.
B004J869AE|2|Wiper was missing the part that locks it on to the arm. Returned for refund which was taken care of quickly.
B00L7X80AG|5|Made my truck look great
B00BSY719A|5|great
B007P14NPU|5|A NOISELESS, patient spider,<br />I mark’d, where, on a little promontory, it stood, isolated;<br />Mark’d how, to explore the vacant, vast surrounding,<br />It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself;<br />Ever unreeling them—ever tirelessly speeding them.  5<br /><br />And you, O my Soul, where you stand,<br />Surrounded, surrounded, in measureless oceans of space,<br />Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing,—seeking the spheres, to connect them;<br />Till the bridge you will need, be form’d—till the ductile anchor hold;<br />Till the gossamer thread you fling, catch somewhere, O my Soul.
B0068OZ25K|5|There is a ritual you have to do to the FOB Gods. If you follow these steps you will be rewarded. It took me 4 times to get it right so don't give up. I feel like I'm of average maybe above average intelligence. But don't ask that question of my wife or brother. It works but you MUSt follow the step order to a TEE! With that being said the remote seems like its made of the same material the OEM one is. For this price ill follow the steps. Toyota can Kiss my Pepe! $149 for a remote and $55 to program it. What a bunch of Richards!
B00HRMST8O|5|Looks better than OEM lightes.
B00OBYD5TO|5|new look to stang
B007EWGEWA|5|Got them for my dad. He is an oSu alumni. Was pleased with the look of the mats & thickness. He was excited they had the oSu emblem & it is hard to find Oklahoma products now that he is in Illinois. We were pleased with the price. They are holding up well with the bad weather.
B009NV8GLW|5|nice touch,  worked as expected
B00KEVX7ZK|5|looks awesome on my bike
B0014BV0T4|5|Looks great and just as described. Great quality looks like original equipment and great price. I am very happy with this purchase.
B000C9KQSA|5|Works like it's supposed too! The belt continued to have a slight squeeking noise for the firste couple of weeks, but that was only until the parts had been worn in.
B00MWNZ4XQ|2|junk
B00DQRSK9C|5|Ultimate cranking power
B005KDO9C2|3|Well. I bought these bulbs for my 2003 Hyundai Accent. What I found is that they are in fact brighter than the $4.00 NAPA cheap bulbs, but not significantly enough to pay fifty bucks. I had them in from May to December of this year and one of them blew. Some might think I touched the bulb which led to an overheat. I did not. I wore powder free latex gloves while installing them. There is NO warranty on Sylvania's website. So I went out and bought Phillips crystal visions I think. They are the same color / brightness and they are about 15 bucks cheaper. If you want bright white bulbs then get HIDs (If your car legally supports it.) If you wanna take the risk and try out some LED headlight bulbs then that's up to you.<br />  Overall they worked great while I had them, and they are whiter / brighter. I just don't think I will spend that much on bulbs again. I think some cheaper bulbs my do just as well. Just giving people a heads up.
B004HPSI6M|2|The car charger does not charge the Garmin consistently, and I have problems with it turning on at times - it seems to think it is hooked up to a computer!  Also, at times, it stays in that mode rather than going on to loading the maps and giving me directions and the only thing to fix it is force it to turn off then it resets itself.  This has happened about a half dozen times in the month I have had the unit.  Should have bought Garmin brand, I guess..
B005XUZMQ4|1|for the price i had purchased it for, it wasn't worth it. it lasted my about 8 months before i had to go and replace it again. when it comes to electronics, i've learned when it comes to electronics and you XJ, it pays to stick with mopar.
B00B7LYICC|5|Nice items actual metal not cheesy plastic. We reused the original plastic gasket material since the one that came with the unit was a little too rubbery and wanted to keep coming out of place. Some instructions would have come in handy also.
B000IYX6RW|1|The part in the did not fit a 1992 Chevy K1500. Amazon made me pay return shipping even tho the green check mark said this fits your car. As far as the part goes,who knows.
B000EBKG9A|5|I'm not using it to cover a whole window, which is what I suppose it is originally intended for. I just have a few bright LCD lights from appliances that are too bright for my taste. I just cut off a little piece of this sheet and it sticks with surface tension (no glue). You can always remove later. It is PERFECT!
B0084LT7EW|4|Great design and fit's like a glove
B00GEZEVIW|1|I ordered this tag for my boyfriend for Christmas. In the picture it looks like a metal finish (around the edges), but when this product arrived, it looked like a bad screen-printed flex sheet pasted on an aluminum plate. The background also looks beige instead of gray like the picture suggests.<br />The really bad part was that this plate was shipped from China, half-way across the globe, wrapped in soiled bubble wrap and in an envelope! Needless to mention, it arrived bent. The seller was very good about issuing the refund to me, but it really ruined the Christmas surprise. We just ended up buying a vanity plate from Lids instead, for the same price!
B001QVEC4W|5|Great product over all superior build quality when compared to factory oem standards.  These come with zerk fittings and can be greased! Perfect fit for my 1998 Ford Contour, if you live in the North East I highly suggest before installing these coat them with roll on bed-liner product such as Herculiner.  Overall extremely pleased with this product.
B000C8BMVG|3|Nice radiator. Fit well, however the transmission cooling lines on my 98 C1500 w/ a 5.7L are 3/8\\" however the fittings on the radiator are 5/16\\". I had to buy two 3/8\\" to 5/16\\" inverted flare transmission adapters. Bought them at O'Reilleys for $6.51. Amazon web site confirmed this was a fit for my truck. Not a huge deal, but it delayed my repair and added some cost.
B00ATGHWQU|1|Tomkoz is soo not the best sticker seller please go back and search for another one! Cheaps decals and stickers too
B000CSW3SM|5|Can this work for 2001 Honda accord?
B00EZD4DZQ|4|Perfect fit and 4x cheaper than the dealer cost!
B004JMDWCI|5|well says does not fit my 2014 arctic cat 450 but after looking at arctic cats mounts for my 450 it listed other model that they fit. according to warn this mount fits those other models so took a chance and ordered it only glitch was a mou t on the left frame rail was where my ubolt should go but was able to install at slight angle and works fine. now i can get a 54in blade instead of arctic cats stupid 50 in blades.
B000SL4AA2|5|I have used it many times already and I love it!  The first time I had to use it, I had a flat tire and didn't have time to read the instructions. It was so easy.
B002XM5E6S|5|DEasy to install and fit perfect.
B000E3GGYW|5|These seat covers fit really well on our 2004 Optima and 2001 Accent. I've gotten lots of compliments and laughs about the seat covers. I've had them about 2 years now and they're still in great shape.
B001PWFPRU|5|in fact you can push the tailgate up halfway and let go - it will stay there for a few seconds then slowly drop back down.  we had it installed at a garage... note you need one of those star screwdrivers to install (at least on a dodge) - we have 08 3500 ram
B0027QR2SI|5|Item arrived quickly, new.  Fits perfectly in the car secured to the middle console....you dont even have to remove or untie the trap to empty the garbage...simply open the velcro straps at the bottom and release trash into another bag and throw away.  This item is not sold in stores that I could find.  Very happy.
B007NGB5VM|5|Sizing is right, quality is very good.
B002G225QW|3|These did not last long, got a bit floppy, but good for the price
B007N1Q16G|5|I'm happy with my purchase, I thank you.
B001NZQIFM|5|Perfect fit on our 2013 Tundra.  Cable was long enough to mount anywhere you wanted in the &#34;knee&#34; area.  Anywhere else, you will need longer.
B000BYGDZG|5|Looked exactly what was in my truck.  Replaced the old without an issue.  Even came with 3 new screws to hold it in place.
B00KXE3Q3Q|5|Very good quality!
B007EEWPMQ|5|I get asked all the time if the sticker is real and I get asked where I got it from.
B000QS3JPE|1|Cheap piece of plastic
B002LNGKVC|5|I have been a car cleaning fanatic all my life, but since I started using griots polishes I can see a marked improvement in how my vehicles look.
B00BDEPR7I|5|One of those little things on a trailer that breaks and is annoying. So glad this company stocks all the little parts. :)
B0020J866Y|5|Honda kept it simple with these Mats. They are made of nice thick quality material and came with all the original socket holes where you can run them through the floor teeth and they sit nice and snug.<br /><br />They are all black, and once you put them in your car, assuming its a black leather interior like mine, it really finishes the look. They are also very nice with cleaning. I take them off, run a little water through them, maybe run a wash cloth around the seams one time to get all the dirt out and they're back to being good as new.<br /><br />Highly recommend it if you care about your Accord.
B0073UM97C|5|Worked perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for. It was a direct replacement for the OEM.
B00A0IEC2E|5|Perfect! Pretty easy to install. It took about 20 min.
B009VI5F7U|1|Received it in good time ,but side fell out when installed. Had to return it. Bought one locally with life time warranty for three dollars more. On the plus side our money was refunded without a hassle.
B0094ECRAO|4|whats to say.
B004323RS8|3|Lowish water passes through due to the 3/8&#34; size. I only use it out by the pool, so not a big problem.
B00LL4CEBW|4|Came really quick! Had to sand down the paint and use a hammer for the peg, but overall, it was great! Looks amazing on the bike
B000E81VN8|5|This thing is definitely sturdy.  I didn't read it in the description so i'll let people know that the dividers have velcro not only on the outside as straps, but on the bottom of the inside as well.. I'm not saying its hard to take off, but those thick velcro straps are strong and are the opposite of flimsy.  Fits PERFECTLY in my 2015 Rogue.  Essentially the exact length across and the width about reaches the back seat to the middle divider in the cargo bay, in front of the divider you can flip up, so it doesn't even move. Fantastic.
B0053ZAIYU|4|I wanted a bike light- &#34;just in case&#34; -(you know how it goes-especially when a bike is your only transportation!) & a small &#34;emergency light&#34; is a much better idea than being without! (Especially at this price! Thanks!)
B00E1SROQU|5|Great fit, without any brake noise or braking issues.  Ford Expedition driven from Maryland to Las Vegas towing a 6 X 12 trailer up and through the mountains.  Callahan is definitely a brand I can recommend.
B006X8BFLQ|5|Does what it's supposed to do. Had to bend the tabs a bit to make fit but overall easy to install. I wish it matched the upper grill. I didn't even think about that when I ordered it.
B00DUMWINM|5|Nice Sticker, easy to apply and easily read. The red really makes it stand out. Just watching people shake their heads was well worth it
B000FW4LMG|2|Not what expected
B0010GFSF0|5|Best price I could find for real OEM part
B005SGZGW8|5|Great antenna replaced the original on a 2003 corolla type S with this one car looks much better not having the original which was pretty long great buy
B00L40GT5K|5|Great product and quality!
B000C9LOHW|5|Fit my 2008 Chevy Avalanche 4L60E deep pan.  Arrived wrapped in plastic with the gasket flat!  Very nice.  Bent, folded or stretched gaskets are a pain.  I'm not sure the name of the gasket material, but it's the dense papery gasket.  I like this type of gasket because it seems to be easier to remove when replacing.  No leaks with proper torque.  Comes with filter, pan gasket and the seal.
B007RVQXRO|5|Parts were easy to order, came promptly, had installation instructions and were easy to install.  They look and perform like OEM at considerably less money.  The Toyota dealership wanted, yes, $300 for these struts.  Just silly.<br /><br />I will buy from these guys again when the need arrises.
B001QVDWCK|1|I do not think that this item is a raybestos tie rod end. The box it came in (Raybestos Tie Rod) said made in<br />Germany but the tie rod is marked made in Great Brition.
B000CITKCE|5|I put these on all my vehicles that are in storage.  I bought them on a recommendation of another car collector.  His cars sit all year run only a few times and he's not had a dead battery in years.  Fully automatic, just leave it plugged in without a worry!  Waterproof so I have mine mounted on board in my wave runners.
B0002SR4Q8|5|This product makes removing the oil filter like a walk in the park. It's spring loaded, the harder you turn, the tighter it grips. No regret and will recommend for any one who is looking for a universal oil filter wrench
B00032K50U|1|I bought these screws for my car(2006 ford escape) but they were completely the wrong size.  I thought that license plate screws would be universal, but obviously they are not.
B001U028JK|4|I just received this camera, and plan to use it in my travel trailer to see if any cars are behind me.  I am not very keen on tying this into the trailers parking or reverse lights.  On a hunch, I tried to hook the wires up to a 9-volt battery.  Lo and behold, we have a picture!  I am currently testing to see how long the battery lasts (and it is an old battery).  So far, it is still transmitting after 30 minutes.  If it lasts a long while, I'll have to find a 9volt connection from an old radio, snip it, and splice the wires together.
B000KKPFFA|5|This is a superb product and no home should be without it.<br /><br />This stuff is extremely strong, solid, and easy to apply.  Once hardened, it is rock solid.<br /><br />It is grindable, sawable, cuttable, and drillable once hard.<br /><br />Great product, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />.
B0064VJOVK|5|Helps the car look nice. I wonder if the tape used to adhere the chrome will damage when removed. I think as long as these are as reasonable in price I will continue to buy them
B00DZ35HES|5|Battery is working well thus far without any issues.
B004GCDMKS|3|need some work to fit
B0036QX4EY|5|works great for my 2013 Ducati Hypermotard with rear spools
B000FTE304|5|Looks great on my `07 Trailblazer.pay attention to the rh & lh markers indicating what sides goes where, easy to apply.
B002TUJTSS|5|Perfect for winter riding. Offer the best protection from the cold. If you 4 wheel or snow bike in the winter these are the ticket.
B0002MAE5C|5|i like the look these covers give my lights and my vehicle. they are 5 inch fit and are pretty tight fit when you put them on but they do fit good.
B009QM6GYW|5|This set made pulling both door panels on two different cars very easy and did so with no damage to panels or fasteners.
B00274JM7E|5|This inexpensive, yet very attractive organizer is awesome.  I always keep a box of tissues in my car.  I traded up to a suv with a deeper storage console, but my tissue box had to be maimed to fit in there.  I love that I can put this on my visor so that its within reach, and I don't have to open anything if I need it while driving down the road.  It is not obstructive, but it was a little distracting, so I moved it to the passenger side.  You can easily replace these tissues with any brand.
B001RBCU90|5|love it!!!
B00L4V9ECY|5|Very easy install on HID bulbs, great quality. Hooked these up and the computer error on my car went away finally after dealing with the error message and noise for weeks
B000C01TUS|5|THE front brake choice (if you are sticking with stock brakes) for my 2006 LJ Rubicon is the Centric Premium rotors and EBC Yellowstuff brake pads.  Before the Centric/EBC brake combo, I would be literally standing on the brake pedal when descending a steep hill.  Now, only moderate pressure is required.  I am beyond pleased with this combo.<br /><br />This review is specific to the combo of the Centric Premium rotors and the EBC Yellowstuff pads.
B000COBVXE|5|Great price
B000N3342A|2|was a pain to put on,<br />then at the end of winter the cheap screws started to rust. now it looks horrible so i'm goning to put the original back on.
B008H3YIV4|1|Only lasted - 10 hrs --
B009GX0H0U|2|it didnt fit properly and it didnt even stick well. waited a long time just to be disappointed. ill just find one in a local store next time
B002MEJB1Q|5|Excellent extra behind the seat storage! Will fit in any car or SUV. Great product!
B000EFN03K|1|Very attractive lights. But they burn out very quick. Sooner than incandescent . LED are suppose to last long time.  Have them on all my trailers. They have failed even on trailers that  are not submersed . Today I have started replacing them with another style as they fail. Unreliable, poor quality.
B007HBKRJY|5|Very nice hitch. Easy install
B001NYK9NK|3|I purchased this part in April and installed it in my tailgate.  The handle just broke in July, for slightly over 3 months of use.  We do not use our tailgate that much, so the handle broke with very little use.  The description says limited lifetime guarantee, so I contacted the manufacturer and this is the reply I received:<br /><br />\\"I regret that your recent purchase has not met your expectations.  I will be happy to direct you to the website or retailer you purchased this item from.  As a wholesale distributor, our only involvement is shipping product on behalf of our customer.  Any questions or issues about the product you purchased must be directed to the Retailer you paid.  We cannot provide any other assistance.\\"<br /><br />I will follow up with Amazon, but poor quality and lack of service from this manufacturer gives this a poor rating.<br /><br />Update:  Amazon replaced the product with no issues and even sent the replacement out next day air.  Still disappointed that the product failed so early, but I am hoping it was just a bad part.  Amazon sure made good on the replacement though.  So, 1 star for the product and 2 more for Amazon's response bumps this up to 3 stars.
B008C4L46A|4|Would totally recommend to any SOA fan. Looks awesome on my laptop with other Sons of Anarchy stickers I purchased.
B00150P0O0|5|My ex is the one who initially turned me on to these and I've kept one in my car ever since. I've never ventured from the Squash scent because it's just that good. It's fresh without being overpowering, it lasts longer than anything else I've used, and the cassette itself isn't gaudy or ugly. They're a bit steep on the price, but well worth the garbage you buy anywhere else. Definitely recommend.
B00NIY2IJ6|5|My mom lives out in the country and deer run across her roads all the time. This would be a great tool to use for when that happens. They are affordable and the size is just perfect. It's really hard to not hit a deer when out at night, especially since you can't hear or see them when driving. These air horns will work great for warning others of the oncoming deer and also scare the deer away so that they don't get hit or run into your car.
B004X0VNSQ|4|I got it in the mail and put my things inside to see if it was really air tight. It is. I was surprised how tight the vacuum is.
B00176MKCC|3|With great anticipation of being able to use this cover if I got caught in an unexpected rain shower, I received my new cover quickly as promised. The first thing I read when opening the box was, \\"we highly recommend that you wait at least 10-15 minutes for your exhaust pipes to cool before covering depending upon the type of motorcycle or scooter and location of exhaust.\\" Well, there goes my need. I guess I could partially cover the scooter and wait, but I chose not to keep the cover. Otherwise, I would recommend the cover as it is a good one for all other purposes. The gentleman I spoke with at the company was really nice and will be happy to let me return the item. I am hoping to get back my shipping as I would have never ordered the item had I known about the time needed to wait before using the cover - regardless of the heat shield. Perhaps posting that on the listing might be a nice idea.
B000CMH1WQ|5|Highly recommend getting a 90* drill bit converter, and some mounting tape just as a secondary precaution.
B007MUY958|4|Lift supports weren't easy to find. Tried a local auto parts (franchise) store, they ordered the wrong item, so I decided to go online. I ordered the same item that was already on my chevy 1500 with the Leer top. This ordered part worked as expected, but took longer to receive (11 days) than expected.
B000X2IUKM|5|I love this cushion! if you have any tailbone (coccyx) pain, this is great help! I use it in my car every day, since I have to drive a lot! have one in the office too, I recommend this cushion if you have any pain or discomfort while seating!
B004U1O9Q6|5|I have gotten compliments on these sunglasses that fit over my prescription glasses.  They have style which many \\"fit over\\" sunglasses do not have.  I am well pleased with them.
B008MMDTI8|1|it does not keep time. the cover for the battery keeps coming off which makes it stop keeping time<br />waste of money
B000CMKF5G|3|Okay. Not the highest quality.
B003I6CWHM|1|This product was awesome.  P & G screwed it's customers again by discontinuing it and now people who had the foresight to purchase supplies before they ran out are in turn ripping off the public.  This filter was $9.99 brand new.  So you can pay $35 and have an additional 10 washes but when it runs out it runs out.  I wouldn't buy this filter from this very greedy individual.  Just move on and find a different product.  I agree with the other reviewer, you may as well by the premium filter thing for $249.  What a rip off.
B002GTMF7E|5|Quality is good and the install on my Suzuki C90 was easy.  I did not have to reroute any cables but if these risers were any taller, I would have had to replace the brake and throttle cables.
B000C1Q6KU|5|Good parts at a good price.  Fast shipping!
B007TY06JA|5|Perfect fit
B000BGM89Y|3|If this thing had very Good wheels I would give it 5 stars all day long, If this thing had very good and quiet wheels, and was see thru on one side I would sell the one I have now and buy it.
B000EVYGZA|3|This is just okay. The readings can at times be flaky. I often have to turn this off then turn it back on to get an accurate reading. No, it's not the batteries. This happens even with fresh batteries. I'm currently looking for a better, more accurate multimeter.
B001C6Q834|5|Bracket is made of heavy metal and appears to be powder coated black. bolts included in the package.Been on the truck six months. working fine.
B001NIAH9W|5|this heavy duty strap was what I been looking for hope it holds up to the weather
B003V501EG|5|If you like good quality wipers at a reasonable price, look no further. I think you are going to like these bad boys made by Rain-x.I think they are totally awesome. Try them.
B004YLU362|5|It was the perfect birthday present.
B000COL4A4|4|It'll do a good job keeping dust out of the back of your truck. I would recommend it for anyone who drives on dirt roads at all.
B00AH7X3F0|4|This is a great bag and the magnets are strong. I have already used it on one trip and the bag held and didn't move at all. I dont even use the straps it came with as the magnets are more than strong enough to hold it.
B001NZHHFM|5|excellent price and fast service (delivery) on an outstanding factory part, thank you amazon i've saved so much over the years!!  delphi compressors have performed very good for me and my family, friends , highly recommend Delphi if you are looking for quality and durability!!
B00E8KG12O|5|This was better than described, it arrived sooner than expected, I put it on my truck right away. Lots of comments,  even ford fans laugh. I was so pleased I order more the next day from this supplier. Thank you again
B0050NAP66|2|First timer. I did get the OEM liner out cleanly. All upper/door trim and on one side all panels must come out. Other side top half loose. I located replacement plastic panel fasteners at NAPA. Black is the only choice, you must have them. Match length & diameters. The new Acme liner is about half the thickness of the factory headliner. I am not sure about its insulation qualities, we'll see. THE GOOD.  Nicely finished, cloth/foam glued to ABS every square inch.  Color matches close enough.  ABS is flexible enough it helps to get it back into vehicle.  NOT SO GOOD. The cut outs in the ABS were just not quite right.  Better front to back than side to side. These are the cut outs for sun visors & end supports, grab handle, coat hanger, and cab light. I got it in, barely. What a PITA!  The included velcro strips are helpful to support, say the back half.  This is still a two person job at times.  After moving it every little way trying to find the ideal position, I eventually had to commit to the passenger side with grab handle & visor and then to trim the drivers side visor mount cutout.  I then pulled the dome light fixture (again), pulled down in the center while simultaneously starting the drivers sun visor mount.  Once mounted, the middle just pops up.  The visor end mounts are in but show some of the exposed cut out.  At this point I'm done with it.  2 days work.  I won't attempt this job again except maybe for a single cab small pickup.
B000OAX7YC|3|The quality is just OK
B007UMC8SI|5|I bought this for my son.  He really loves it.  The yellow color is bright. It came pretty fast in the mail, too.
B00029JHGW|5|Just want I needed to finish my car and go race.<br />Shipping was fast and product description was. Perfect<br />Would definitely purchase again if I need to
B000UVUAFO|5|I have a black car. Did that get your attention?? I have an '03 VW Jetta and while my car has always shined up pretty well, every time I take it to the stealership I know there's going to be some fine scratches somewhere the mechanics were working at. I hate it when I look at my car in the sun because I always notice that stuff. So last year I read a lot of reviews on scratch removal, tried a bunch of expensive things, and nothing seem to work on those pesky fine scratches. For those of you who know, anytime you even look at a black car you're going to get fine scratch somewhere because of it. So I read this article about Quixx and thought \\"It couldn't hurt.\\" So I bought it and it sat in my basement for a while because I had really bigtime doubts. Today I had to do a couple things to my car and figured I would finally give Quixx a shot. So I found a tiny scratch, followed the instructions and \\"POOF!\\" the scratch was gone. No fine white line remaining, no nothing. I figured I would give it a shot on a larger, more noticable scratch and \\"POOF!\\" that one was gone. THEN I took a flashlight and followed up over the spots I used Quixx on and STILL did not see anything. I am now a believer. Since car paint is a \\"poly\\" I'm guessing it manipulates the paint to close the gap where the scratch is. I read a lot of reviews on here where people said it messed up thier paint. Again I am guessing they had older paint and would not reccommend using it on an older paint job. My only suggestion is to follow up with your own polish afterwards. That polish cloth they give you scared me a little bit and while it did shine up, my polish and cloth works better for that. I am actually looking foward to going back over my entire car with the stuff, I highly recommend it!
B002YKBPXA|5|For walks in the hood.
B00L3FUVFK|5|Never even really thought of carrying a little 12V compressor around in my car with me but man the day that I received this little guy I ended up getting a flat tire. Go figure. Needless to say I am very glad I had it. It is very small in size which is nice to just have in the trunk area. It doesn't pump a tire up from dead flat to full instantly so those of us without patience might have to find something to do for the couple minutes it does take. Not too noisy. I would say for the size and the price its pretty handy.
B00KVO4RZY|5|Love it is Made In USA.
B006VODTYS|1|Passenger side mat keeps moving.  I thought these were supposed to be laser cut for exact fit?
B00C5SOMIQ|5|Got the struts at a good price and In good time, I pulled the old ones out and put the new ones in with no hassle of swapping springs over. solved my problem. easy as abc.
B00FTNN91A|1|The company is awesome!!! The problem is the part does not meet the quality standards of the OEM. The plastic clips that are intended to hold the latch rods are too flimsy/loose & do not grip the rod tight enough to allow the mechanism to hold on while opening the door. Second the lever that is suppose to be controlled by the lock/unlock portion of the cover does not stay in place (low tension) therefore it slips up/down & does not allow for opening the tailgate.<br />Bummer, but so far everyone I have interacted with @ this company is STELLAR! waiting on return postage.
B008BGKA96|1|i thought the air freshener is a car that gives out fragrance like most fresheners, actually it is just a picture of a car, which is misleading and disppointing. for that price, we can get an actual little car air freshener, not just a picture. i want to return it with full refund otherwise i will file a claim with amazon. should not have bought without positive reviews.
B007FMTTFS|5|Fit perfectly on my customer's xterra. This got rid of the abs light.
B00LULJIW4|5|Perfect for my Ham Radio Portable Solar Power Generator
B003DNJ728|5|I needed a car cover for my 2007 Impala SS. This cover fits it perfectly from front to rear and comes down to the wheels.  Every inch of my vehicle is covered. It stands up to high winds, which I saw first hand the second day after I installed it. It's light enough for a one person install yet the material, in my opinion, is good enough to protect my cars finish. The price is fantastic! All around, this cover is an excellent buy and the fit is perfect! You will not be disappointed!
B000C2UHU4|5|great
B009F4JHHO|5|I like about it that it is very small and fast (Andoird Torque says it can query about 20 params/second).<br />Pair this with an android running Torque and you can monitor all your car's OBD parameters.<br /><br />It can also be used with FORscan to monitor Ford's (especially Focus).
B000VAJ17M|4|Ok, first let me say these are very well made chains and the cams  are the way to go in my opinion. When ordering i used the ordering guide that you can click on the product page, I made sure i selected the QC2228CAM as the chart  called for that chain for my tires, however upon getting the chains nowhere on the bag did i see my tire size of LT 265/75/16 all sizes marked on the bag were for 17, 18, and 19&#34; tires and though they fit snuggly  i wasnt satisfied so i simply moved the cross chain back one link and that did the trick. I put them on and tightened them and then drove out my driveway and back (about 1700 feet) and then re-tightened them and now they are  tight. I went back and double checked the size from the sizing chart and double checked what i ordered and  i was right but i have no idea why  they came the way they did and since it was a simple fix i see no reason to give them less than 4 stars
B0041UC7OC|4|This Side Replacement Fog Light fits my car and i like it and it's comfortiable at night when fog light is lighting.
B009D0S0FU|1|Piece of crap. Didn't work. Had to tape the connections to get any readings and the internal resistance was crazy high and all the readings fluctuated too much to get any useful information from it.
B0047RV8WG|4|I had these since 2011 and they're still bright as when I bought them. No major issues with them, except for 2 bulbs that the resistor de-solder but I took the bulb apart and solder the resistor and put it back together and it's still working. Can't complain about the brightness of this bulbs.
B0002V2FEQ|3|This unit works good. I have had the trigger jam a few times, which requires me taking the lighter inside out and placing it back in. The first few times you use this, it will emit a bad smell. So before you use it in public use it at home. I use this to repair cell phones, for heating up the glass and loosening adhesive, so it works great for that.
B001DONZXQ|5|Works as expected.
B000637TNM|5|Great conditioner for softball gloves, horse bridals and saddles and any other leather material.  Soaks in, softens leather and makes it somewhat water proof.
B008ZT78EO|4|This is a very nice plate cover.  Its like an expensive frame for a so-so painting.  I knocked one star off because there's not much clearance between  glass and plate  mounting bolts that's stock with Ford and probably with other OEMs.  I had to get new low profile bolts to make this work on my car.  It would have been nice if these were included with frame.
B001KS8PIU|5|Just installed it today looks good lets see
B000C09022|5|This product was less than half of the oem and works just as well if not better. Good Deal , good product
B0062BHOOG|5|good machine
B000YCDVBE|5|Good product, my vehicle looks cooler.
B00TGODETA|4|Working great
B0007UA1NE|5|works as promised, my filter is back in and working well
B0079ZB9UE|1|Don't fit
B003IS3HV0|4|I first used this product on a brown lambskin leather jacket.  The Jacket is a size Large, and falls right below my waist.  I applied the leather honey to every inch of the leather on the jacket, and it took just over half of the 8oz bottle.  A little really does go a long way.  After I let the jacket air dry for 24 hours it was almost back to its original/brand new color and feel.  I left a small section on the inside untouched so I could see/feel the difference, and it is remarkable to see how bad my jacket had gotten before I used the Leather Honey.  Also, I own many leather cleaning and conditioning products, and I have quite a bit of leather clothing, so I promise you my opinion on this product is worth checking out.    This conditioner is great for jackets, gloves, belts, and purses, but I would stick to mink oil and Apache creme for boots.  Leather Honey does not have the water repelling ability of Mink oil, but it is semi-water protective.  The directions say to use a sponge to apply, but hell it is a lot easier just to use your fingers.  Do NOT allow the leather material to come in contact with anything while it is drying.  Dirt will stick to it like white on Michael Jackson.  So, my 2 cents:  buy leather honey if you need to restore/protect/condition any soft, pliable, leather.  It may require multiple coats over several days time.  For boots, stick to products made for boots.
B001JT5QBO|5|The only problem is that the fan is a little loud but this think kicks out awesome power and kina heats up my cab. Otherwise perfect product.
B008KZKA0M|5|Perfect!!
B002OUMU66|3|Product works fine just a bit big for my application.
B00A82JVNW|5|great product just as advertised very happy customer
B000EDUUIA|5|The Camco 44442 AccuPark makes it a snap to consistently park that car of yours exactly where you would like it to be.<br />I bought 2 because I wanted both cars specifically parked where I could easily and safely leave room for our recumbent cycles.<br />So whether you have a need to make sure your garage has everything where you want it to be or just simply want the peace of mind that every time you park your vehicle you are being safe and protective of equipment near by, give these little gems a try. But once they are stuck to the floor with their built in adhesive strip you won't worry because you will be glad they are there quietly and simply doing it's job.  No need for flags or flashing lights or wasting batteries like some devices. Yeah, this one time when batteries aren't included and the good news is they don't need them.<br />In a perfect world, every place you park would have Camco AccuPark waiting to help you. Till then, at least buy one or two for YOUR parking space.
B0000ATZEG|5|This lock is of good quality. and I will post pictures of it on my Facebook, It was a good deal
B000BW8NGA|4|replaced the old wires, do what there designed to do.
B003CW4ZOK|5|Arrived on time. It cost me only $25 to install it and it is working. I don't get the TPMS light flashing any more.
B00ENZFO4U|2|This arrived quickly and it seems pretty sturdy but it is really small. Too small for my purposes so I sent it back.
B009FU77ZM|5|As soon as I opened the box I could tell this shock is of a higher quality. I put Bilstein's on all four corners. Once installed they leveled out my FJ and the ride felt new again.
B005QWJIQ4|5|took far too long (several weeks) to deliver but for an OEM, this vendor had a great price.<br />I just wouldnt plan my garage time until you have the part in your hand.<br />I believe they use the FedEx Fiasco shipping method with the great black hole in tracking where nobody has it but its on the way.<br />The vendor reported it SHIPPED almost immediately though. Kudos for their effort at least.
B000ER68LO|5|I love these. I've had two on my black Explorer for over a year now. I have driven thousands of miles through all weather conditions, and they still look great. I get loads of compliments on them. I saw a coworker that has a plastic cross on his company truck and no one has said anything against it, so I'm back now to get one of these for my company truck too. Cheers! :-)
B004GCCDO4|5|Perfect fit
B00A1A6PT4|5|Perfect Fit and easy installation.  I'd like to smack the engineer who decided to run the coolant through the belt tensioner on the 3.8L but whatever.. It just makes for a more expensive tensioner replacement. It's easy enough to install with some hand tools.  I always lubricate the o-rings so they don't roll when installing and makes for an easy installation.
B001CEG90I|5|It's an air filter.
B005KDOAP8|4|AFTER LOOKING FOR THE WHITEST BULBS AVAILABLE I FOUND THESE. THEY ARE MUCH WHITER AND ARE SLIGHTLY BRIGHTER THAN STOCK.  IT IS EASIER TO SEE THE ROAD AND LOOKS GREAT IN MY CAR.
B009HINM4M|5|very good
B00HQZAYCQ|4|Great change ,easy to install only a little overprice but I like it ...
B004EIBXAA|2|fairly fragile construction.  but worst thing was that it failed to charge at the 2 amp setting after only a few days.
B004VL4KM8|5|Perfect fit and same exact length as the original so (while you should get the tracking done after after replacing track rod ends) you can at least count the rotations to get the new ones set quite well.<br /><br />Fitted my 2004 Audi TT roadster.<br /><br />Looks like a very well made and solid part, time will tell of course but BA aftermarket parts seem good OEM replacements based on my experience.
B000XQ9MGE|5|I purchased this to use as a 12v power supply for my astronomical telescope -- and it works very well for that application.  Much to my surprise, I also had to use it twice already to help friends jump start their cars, and it also worked flawlessly.  It holds a charge well, and it compact and well thought out.  Highly recommended -- you never know when you'll need it, and it takes no more room than jumper cables -- and is easier to use.
B002P2TWIM|1|I have a 1000 lb capacity tongue jack and this is too small, the other model number for these is way too big. Pretty disappointed that I can't find one that will fit.
B0015N27UM|1|If made in China doesn't matter to you then it's a cheap alternative to the American made Warn receiver shackle.<br /><br />This is also the very same receiver shackle under the Superwinch brand.<br /><br />I personally buy American over Chinese import if I have the option.
B0089KNGNQ|5|great item worked well
B001P29X4G|5|Made my headlights so much brighter!!
B00SK4KUVM|1|Hello, my led bulbs are flashing and I have an bulb error code than comes up.
B000CEP1V2|5|this was the correct pump for my 1999 nissan altima...once i accessed the old pump the new pump was easily installed and worked perfectly
B006D1GJ5K|5|Perfect!!!!! love the brightness
B000YCAM70|5|Really made my wife happy with these fantastic custom fit weather mats for her 2011 Lincoln MKX!  The material is thin, yet strong, and the items we put in the cargo area stay put without sliding all over the place.  Made in USA was a big plus too!
B000FW7V50|5|Didn't believe it, but it works.  It cleans and adds enough lubrication to your fuel system for a smooth and quiet running engine (as long as you aren't using it to try and &#34;fix&#34; a problem).  This is maintenance product to keep things running smooth, quiet and like new.  It does just that.
B004R388JG|4|Having a bike rack has worked out great!  I wish I got one sooner.  This one has done the job, however it wobbles. It's necessary to use bungee cords to stabilize.
B0040QOXDU|1|Not only does it distort vision but it is bulky and would be a problem if in even a minor accident since it would cause a head injury.  I suggest that you discontinue selling this product.
B0068TYFFS|1|This sticker is only the black outline, with no white part. It's not visible on darker-colored cars, and it's hard to stick on properly because the black parts are not connected. I am returning this item.
B0028OJAIY|4|Tunes are ok. The drip on their side if the lid is not replaced
B004SFKJIQ|4|The camco really came in as a life saver while we were remodeling our bathroom. My daughter had seen one in a little cabin she was working on in Divide Co and we had to have one. Really like it as a stand by
B0015S991C|5|Stop the car like they should, what else is there to say?  Bought because of Raybestos reputation, too soon to determine life expectancy.
B00BDJ85FO|5|Perfect fit
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Worked great! Charged my phone the whole ride!
B002NTA28G|1|I own a 2003 audi a4 quattro and I bought this item from you but it didn't fit my car. Mine's got one ending instead of the red and black ones, plus, the magnetized sensor is shorter on mine too. Thank God I just spent 20 bucks on this.
B007RLPX4S|2|comes broken
B004LH0CCE|5|good
B00M2PS1RA|5|Good product, gets the job done.
B00353PWAW|5|Really does take care of your cars paint and adds an amazing wax like shine leaving a great car looking awesome
B005HR1EGA|3|The sign was bent because it was not properly shipped, and it's not worth the money to send it back.
B00NOKPPK8|5|Works great.
B000A0EJ9I|5|I've never been unhappy with a Fram product.  They may cost a little more but they are will worth it.  All the Fram filters are an exact fit on all my cars.
B002QEFNP0|5|well made! the new bushings and pin are well made and went in with no problem
B001G73JP4|5|Couldn't find any dealers with it in stock and was getting frustrated until I found this.  The price beat the local dealerships by quite a bit and the service was quite prompt.<br /><br />Fit the old beamer like a charm.
B00480J4J6|1|Not very bright
B0006305RY|5|My engine light went off, when I put it in my gas tank
B0049CK8XO|4|This item came with the parts in the picture as well as a relay, three fuses, two-sided mounting tape, three twist ties and a screw.  The only issue was that the instructions stated that a 10-amp fuse for the converter unit was provided, which in fact was not the case.  I will head to the auto parts store for that one.  Not a big deal.  I did not use the screw provided for the ground wire but used a nut and bolt that I had on hand instead with an existing hole in the car body.
B009DJSEM0|5|Fast shipping. Great product
B00500GOWS|5|Just purchased this Jacket to use it as a casual everyday Jacket ,however was looking for a suede,but when this Jacket arrived ,it's exactly the one in the picture.Not bad at all .solid and quality with snap on buttons .Looks good ,very well made .Definitely recommend this Jacket ,doesn't matter if you're a biker or non biker .It's a great Jacket shirt like,But little pricey.
B006GFBJD0|5|Great product. Very durable. Applied it to the glass of my rear windshield and have not seen any fading or peeling.
B0042Z0E6E|4|Absolutely beautiful and dries instantly. We use it for outside our travel trailer so watch for sparks from fire! I already have a hole in it and I'm super bummed:(
B004TMM9X6|5|Fits perfectly on 2001 Corolla, replacing broken part. Great service and right price. Bought twice from this seller.
B001SIDH08|1|the item i received is wrong.. the picture shows that the color of the checkered is black and white. what i received is white and red checkered. can i refund my money?
B00651BGTC|5|I was hesitant, but believe it when I say this works better than the factory antenna on my truck! I get better reception!!!!
B00DQQLX38|4|Comfy with a nostalgic look.
B00228KSPU|5|I LOVE this bumper sticker. I am going to buy as many as I can afford and pass them out at work and in my neighborhood. America better pray he is gone back to Chicago in January 2013. NOBAMA 2012.
B00KB8LPTQ|5|Love the Look of my tires now!!
B000CLOT6S|4|bit pricey but fit was great and all the pieces youd ever need for rebuilding including clips and check balls.
B004RCOUP8|5|Does what I bought it for.  Works good.  I use it at my RV control panel where the hose comes in from he bottom.
B003V5IG7A|5|Cal-Van tools are well made also. And having the right tool for the task at hand makes life easier. So I am well pleased with my purchase of this tool also.
B001RMTY8E|5|Item delivered on time, was as described.
B000FKIURK|4|I purchased these for my Honda V 65 Magna.  I have a 7\\" round light modification done previously.  These headlamps are a little larger than 7\\" and I had to cut my trim ring to install.  <br />The lighting power is a big improvement over the stock lighting.  Over time, the reflectors develop crack and fade thus, reduce the light beams focus.  These are very good lights.  I was at a convienence store with a riding friend.  We pulled up to the store and the reflection of my headlamp compared to his was far better.   <br />I'm sold on Hella products, there is good value and the lighting makes me feel safer.
B00CMWDRHM|5|Works on so many cars. Easy to program with the Dorman tool.
B000NJ7KTW|5|Very well package and just what I expected an excellent product.
B000K1MYF8|5|Fit my 06 F-350 great.  Saved nearly $200 over the local tire and suspension shop's quote doing this myself.  It was easier than I thought it would be.  No more front end clank and rattle!!
B00RBDQAE4|3|Not impressed with the quality. Not even w/ the design... For 2 dollars, it's a rip off.
B00EVY2SKG|3|I bought these microfiber cloths based upon the description that they were &#34;Ultra Thick&#34; as stated in the title.  I wanted the thicker cloths.  I am disappointed that they are the same thickness as every other standard microfiber towel I have.
B009B6IQLO|2|The product I ordered was clear... and that's what the picture showed but when I received it it was purple...
B00B0I5YM0|5|these are great leds and are a bit brighter than the incandescent bulbs I replaced these with plus no heat issues
B00CNA2BV6|5|This does what it says and works way better than the shammy's i use for drying off my vehicle. I also do lawn work alot and could see where this would help keep me cool during the hot summer months, i'll probably be ordering some more of these soon!
B008BVNMKK|3|they look great but hard to put on
B0085OM3VW|5|A very nice key fob......... looks great in my classic '58, '60, and '63
B001KQ3JOM|5|Cheap and install is very easy.
B009PJJFEO|5|It is the perfect fit for the 2005 Dodge Magnum
B0048FPQPM|5|Awesome product. Fits perfectly for my 2010 Toyota Corolla. I have a black/grey interior going on, all black seat covers, flooring and now dash. My interior doors and plastic are grey and this helps protect and make my car look nice. Easy install, minimal work needed to make it sit flat on my car (5 mins).
B003O0VPXE|5|Fits well, stops the annoying sag from old worn out struts.<br />Installs in about 30 seconds!<br /><br />Be sure to get two.<br />And replace your two trunk struts while your at it.. They're probably gone too.
B001QVBWE0|4|Good
B000UDH0FA|5|Came in good shape, with some promo stuff and a free sticker.  It is just as described, it looks exactly as the picture and shipped faster than expected.  Great seller, great item.  Oh and it is printed on a high quality backing.  I think it will stick to anything and hold up for at least a decade stuck to even a car window.  Peace
B000OUW7KC|5|Can use an old, bent hanger if you want, but why not bust out a few bucks for a dedicated tool?
B005FL2DGS|5|Jeep stops noticeably faster and smother with these installed.
B00NS6YZFY|5|VERY PLEASED WITH THESE SHOCKS FOR THE PRICE
B00BTO51YG|5|The package was delivered pretty quick, earlier than what promised. It is not realy like the picture shows. Logo is really small and is more like a big cotton towel that holds to the headrest. Little loose, slides here and there but over all I like it since protects my light interior seats. I wish they made it for the rear seats.  I have a 2014 Fiat 500L and love my new covers!
B0076KBPNI|4|Its a good product. Cant complain.
B000UK9RAO|2|Look red but are actually Orange. Careful ordering these.
B000GU3X2G|5|On time delivery! The part fit on my 2012  Kawasaki Brute Force with no problems and works well with my Cycle Country State plow.
B0038KT546|5|good quality
B003BDW0TM|3|Has not improved my fuel mileage, sounds nice. The screws were not labeled! Had to play the guessing game where they went.
B001FE7I0U|2|Ordered 2 of these.  The one with rubber boot works as described and intended.  One shipped WITHOUT the rubber boot (which is useless, especially in North East).  They very quickly shipped another one, which arrived again WITHOUT the rubber boot.  I will not be making the mistake a 3rd time.  I've now been delayed over a week waiting to perform an alignment after part is installed.  Bummer :(
B000BQK5YY|5|For the value it is great
B0000CBIK5|4|Great
B00176FTW0|5|repair the mower on less then 15 mins worked great
B003D10QR0|5|I got this PA speaker for my 01 Yukon Denali. with the provided mounting bracket, I was able to mount it behind the grill(i like things looking as clean and stock as possible) and it was a perfect fit.  I also painted it black so it can't really be seen but can definitely be heard!!!  I have it hooked up to my cobra 29 lx cb radio that has a PA speaker outlet.  You do need a mono plug to connect the speaker wires to so it will be accepted by the cb radio output.  It is definitely loud and clear.  Instead of having to buy noise makers, just download an app on your phone and play it through the mic. Great speaker at a great price...well worth it.  It is also very heavy duty an can see it work great on commercial/fleet vehicles.
B0091JCDVK|5|Works well, and was what I was looking for.
B004C65FSK|5|excellent
B0009XXM0S|5|This fit and works on my 2007 Mustang V6 just great.
B000AMOEM8|1|Product takes a lot of work to use. After applying product leaves a haze on glaze which has to be wiped off so you can see through it then your windows won't fog for a little while. Not worth it.
B00AGAENF2|1|Mounted the light and turned it on and 6 of the LEDs didn't work. Really frustrating
B007XZJWTA|5|Wasn't what I was looking for .. But the product was well made .. Had absolutly no problem with getting a refund .. This company put there customers first .. I will purchase from these guys again ..
B00U0UWPAS|5|Fast shipping .. great product
B008YFTB4E|5|I was very cautious when buy these cause I knew if there was a faulty one I'd get  it I installed these on my blazer in 15mins simple plug an play set up  cut it on one side didn't work traced it to the bulb called kenen they shipped me a new set for free I was looking at the harness to the blub found a wire not pushed in the connector all the way boom it worked and they have done great I drive a hour to work an a hour back all at night these have done great
B000OUXA0S|4|Works as advertised, follow the instructions and line it up as instructed and it compressed the spring correctly
B002EQQ5ZW|5|Great little tap to use the small cans of r134A.. High quality and worked great. Recommended. There isn't much more to say about this little tap. If you need it, then you need it. This one is a good value and was high quality.
B00LBF5AYO|5|Real nice decal!! Looks perfect on my land rover :) defiantly worth it!
B002OR4242|4|I replaced an older unit that even though it was supposed to sense charge level and go to a maintain, was always boiling the batteries out.  This unit came with step-by-step instructions for replacing my unit as well as the DC distribution panel.  The output is clean DC that modern electronics can use, even when powered by generator.<br /><br />This is absolutely the way to go.  It cured all my electrical problems.<br /><br />Instructions were provided specifically for the unit I was replacing, and they were overall very good, although they did identify one of the wires as being a different color than it actually was.  It was pretty easy to tell that based on the labels on the lugs of both the old and the new unit, but it was still a bit unnerving when I first powered it up. It is possible that Alpenlite used the wrong color wire when they made the unit, but I would think RV manufactures would stick to standard color codes.<br /><br />I would say that someone with a minimal amount of electrical wiring experience should have little trouble installing it, and if someone were to look through the instructions, and examine what they are replacing, and have doubts, it would not be a big job to have it professionally installed.  From what I have read online, they have excellent technical support, but I did not use them for my installation.<br /><br />I wish I had done this years ago instead of waiting until my battery charging circuit failed and forced me to do something.<br /><br />One more super positive:  This unit is American made.
B00CHRSA6U|5|product was as advertised. easy installation, direct fit and worked great.
B000CMHVBC|5|I have used these shades before. I am glad I was able to get more from amazon. These shades really keep the car cool compared to the inside shades. Because, the inside shades does not prevent the windshield from the heat in turn heat transfer into the car. These shades are a bit hard to get used to in the beginning but a breeze later hooking it up.
B00GVHFCMW|5|I really like this product, this is what I was looking for, until I found it online here, super easy to use, with extra tools it makes my life easier. I like the flash light included. I will recommend this product to all of my friends and family
B004EI6A8K|5|great
B002JOVUO0|5|I love this stuff. You can pretty much use it on whatever you want to without worrying about it sticking to the surface forever. 1/2 inch is perfect for mounting LED strips to pretty much anywhere, which is the main reason I buy/bought it, but it has so many other great uses.
B00BD2702U|3|Good price and great shipping but didn't work at all when I installed them but thanks anyways should've seen that coming
B00B27KM12|5|just right
B00K6D23DS|5|The switch is great quality. Perfect size and easy to install. I will buy more later for winch, and other accessories
B000M5X0IM|5|Lube brush works well enough.
B0007VNZMM|5|Good price all metal bumper. better price than going to the dealer. would recommend thru installation kit. husband likes it.
B00FSIN0U6|3|good light - just a bit on the yellow color - not white as other led bulbs we have , it is bright we had to order opaque lenses to cut done brightness
B003Z9RFU6|5|It was easy to install and looks great.  I had it installed by myself in 10 minutes.  Time will tell how durable it is.
B003NZ4XO8|4|This is a good helmet for the price. It is pretty durable however my gloves ripped and the goggles scratch pretty easily. I deffinately would recommend this to a friend but if u get it u shud get different gloves.
B00HVIGLBG|5|Fits my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee perfectly.
B000EH4V0Y|4|Does what I wanted- keep fluids contained, when pouring.
B00DBENAXQ|3|works fine fairly large for appication
B009SHJH00|5|I restored a 1973 Mach 1 and used LED bulbs from a restoration auto parts company.  They were better than the bulbs but lacked some intensity. I bought these LEDS and replaced the single bulb LED's and what a difference. I also used the whites, blue and green for my instrument panels and my side marker lights. What a great difference in the brightness.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to get away from the glass bulbs.<br /><br />Richard
B000BRFQS8|5|I bought the latch as a back up.
B004O9WC18|4|Great Product
B00I5055P2|5|Thought the spacers are only 2 inches thick. Gotta remember the pivot point is right there at the struts. The center front of my 2005 f150 4x4 bumper went up 3 and one quarter of an inch. Thanks MotoFab. Looks great and didn't even break a sweat on the installation.
B0080N3C22|5|THis USA Flag license plate frame is built in great quality.  I recommend it to all patriotic motorcycle riders who is looking for a USA flag license plate.
B0043AV4NK|5|Wasn't sure about buying this so read the reviews and took everybody word and glad I did.Best muffler for the price sounds nice and deep on my v6 200.
B005XBTF0M|4|Bought the H4 6000k Hi/Lo.<br />Dislike the halogen Hi-beam<br />The Low Beam was Diamond-white very nice,<br />In low beam, the aiming was like high-beam, making a night time looking like day time.<br />But had to take it off immediately since it was aiming incorrectly.<br />Did not want to blind drivers or get a ticket.
B00JDTTXFM|4|I received the grill damaged, although I don't believe the damage was from the manufacturer. it is of good quality and has a good finish. All the mounting brackets and hardware were there. I didn't install, so I can't comment of ease of installation and fit.
B001JHIODS|1|I have had these STICK on plastic leds, DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ONE PICTURE. POOR QUALITY. Even 3M tape will not stick to it back. Had one blew away at summer 100 degree. Mirror cover left with ugly 3M tape...sad.
B000VB0ZQ2|5|Unit appears identical to factory.  Complete with all wiring and hose connections. Flushed tank and installed with fresh gas and engine started right up.
B000BQWHDQ|4|Works as advertised but if you don't turn the elbow into the funnel VERY TIGHTLY it will leak. Only fits in the travel trailer bumper with the two parts disconnected, so every time I use it I run the risk of a leak.
B0083XMY8M|5|I've had these in my 2008 impala for about 10 months now and they are still working great and are really bright, just make sure they are the right size for your car and you shouldn't have any problems.
B007ZYXHEK|4|Great glasses! Fit well, and are light weight and comfy!
B000CB0XFE|5|Local auto parts store couldn't get the right one. Found it on amazon. Perfect fit for my 89 toyota pickup
B001O77CMW|5|This thing has been so useful for me. I've had this guy for the last two years and on 3 different bikes. It has room for a helmet and a bunch of other things. Is pretty much identical to more expensive brands but equal in quality. Would buy again in a heartbeat.
B001GH1O9C|5|I ordered Daystar KJ09101BK since Amazon garage said these weren't for my 98 Cherokee XJ. As it turns out I should've measured. After I had everything torn apart I found out I had the wrong bump stops. After cutting the heck out of them to make them fit everything finally went back together.<br /><br />Cherokee XJ owners double-check your measurements. Instead of buying Daystar KJ09101BK I should've bought Daystar KJ09114BK's.<br /><br />Aside from that, these were perfect for a 4&#34; lift on 32&#34; tires.
B00NJAMTNO|5|Awesome product very happy with the decal and they go on so easy very happy with the product and the product got here in no time
B000E5W9P0|5|You can't beat the price. Acceleration seems to be better but I've not taken a road trip yet to see if the gas mileage improves. Way better than buying disposable filters.
B00ASSDRSG|5|Excellent product!
B000V5CIJK|1|I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK. I WILL NEVER ORDER THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  I WILL ORDER FRAM PRODUCTS FROM NOW ON.
B0065SISA0|5|Awesome looking! And even better looking on the front of my Cadillac :) thank you!
B007YIZM22|3|The bearing fit just fine. Just a little more noisy than I would have liked it to be.
B004X29NHW|5|I knew that these were for a truck or SUV, but I wanted them for my daughters car and this was the only size I found. They still look great and protects the floor board and rug. Everyone loves them. Either that or they're liying because they want a ride. They pitch in for gas so either way these mats are a hit.
B006WQRFW2|1|This is probably the worst quality bearing I've had on a car.  The ABS plug didn't fully connect and had to be zip tied into place and even then the abs sensor wasn't reading propertly (reading wheel was going 50mph when standing still).  To top that we needed the car working so kept it on without proper ABS and then within 6 months of installation it was making noise.  I needed another so I got a warranty replacement (had to pay 40 for a deposit which seemed ok) and bought a second figuring that the quality couldn't be bad for all of them.  That was a big mistake. I had an identical experience with the second one and the replacement they sent was for a non-abs car.<br /><br />The support process for Detroit Axle wasn't very good either.  The person I was dealing with left the company and when I got to someone they wanted me to pay another 40 dollar deposit (which I did on the first) when it went bad again and with the 3 bad/incorrect hubs I had I just wanted a refund at this point and they wouldn't do that (which is fine - it's not their policy) but they did want another deposit to send anything out and planned on keeping my first deposit to pay to ship the replacements.  I've learned my lesson and will pay a bit more and buy local or from Amazon directly or Rock Auto.
B004JC19RI|5|PERFECT!
B000WLHGJA|5|I used to make fun of people in my neighborhood that used the Bumper Bully until I bought my new car.  I felt a little silly using it at first, but it works!  The ONE time I forgot to use it I ended up with a gouge in my bumper from someone's license plate frame, which cost $100 to have touched up.  I use it religiously now, I don't care if it looks dumb, just remember to put it in away before you drive off!
B00DRJ6TKG|4|Good quality looks great
B004VLEMU8|4|Excellent
B002M1PEHE|4|works great in polishing plastic head lights.
B000CP8708|3|These are to easy to install at all. I just ordered to OEM splash guards.
B0066S3WJG|2|Should have improved over the factory version by now.  It's flimsy and only works half the time.
B0036GGFFE|5|Seller shipped as advertised, thank you for that.<br /><br />Product itself without question is the best bearing on the market, I would only use All Balls bearing on any bearing replacement on any project needing bearing.
B00BD9HYGU|5|Great helmet, Looks and fits very nice
B00KTJ2U8W|1|The plastic mold is too thick to fit all the way into the ignition - the collar on the ignition prevents the key from being inserted all the way. And unless the key is inserted all the way, it won't turn the ignition. This could be fixed one of two ways: 1. make the blade of the key about 3/16 inch longer - you still couldn't fit the plastic part into the ignition collar, but the key would go all the way in, enabling you to start the engine, or 2. slim down part of the plastic housing nearest the blade of the key - it can't be any thicker than a regular key for the first 3/16 inch or so past the blade.<br /><br />The remote works, and you can use both the remote and the key to unlock the doors, but it doesn't actually work as car key to start and drive the car. If all you want to do is unlock the doors, there are much cheaper options.
B00KDRDWV4|5|nice hubcaps
B004ZF39T0|5|This would have to be the best HID kit I have ever bought I've tried other brands but they don't last would 100% recommend also comes with cool suitcase
B007N76NXQ|5|fits on the front of my stock FJ80
B0036U3RJC|4|very pricey but they fixed the problem
B004LY01W8|5|Good quality,  delivered fast and in the original BMW packaging. Nevertheless it is expensive if you consider what it is bad what it does. The manufacturing costs most likely do not exceed $5
B000AP8DZY|4|Not a bad wax, not sure if it's better than any other. Might switch back to Nu-Finish as I didn't see much difference
B00CHI8ACI|5|Great service. Keep up the good work.
B008DYK2LW|4|It works, but not something that will last for years. About 6 months to a year and replace.
B00B3TI11W|5|This 200 pound spring was hard to find. Works perfectly on my son's size small intense 951. He only weighs 70 pounds.
B00029KC3E|1|Thin and flimsy. Disappointing.<br />Real fire sleeve is the way to go.
B00HMZFEDO|5|Item as described
B00K8J1T62|5|Very Cool & Awesome looking on the car window.  I ordered mine JUST as shown in the same colors (as these are our school colors).  My daughter was super happy with it!  :)  Very cute!
B005DIQGRU|5|good product no issues
B001O9YRAU|5|Full disclosure.  I didn't buy these from Amazon; if I had I'd have saved a few bucks.<br /><br />These are extremely well-constructed saddlebags, well-designed and easy to load.  Only had them a month, but they make loading my FJR bags much easier, and eliminates carrying the heavy FJR bags to & from the bike.<br /><br />As other reviewer noted, if you over-fill the bags, they are hard to fit into the hard FJR cases.  I consider this really the responsibility of Yamaha for the design of their side-opening cases.  In designing Bestems internal bags, they faced the tough choice of making the bags smaller, reducing capacity, or larger to let the user adjust the load to suit themselves.  So, yes, don't completely pack the Bestem bags, or they won't fit.  Leave some space in them, and expect to somewhat nurse them into Yamaha's trickily-designed cases. I've found the easiest way to do so, is to remove the cases from the bike, & set them on the ground.  Then stuff the fabric bag into the case, tucking as you close and latch the case.  Only after closing the case on the ground, do I load it back to the bike.<br /><br />It WOULD be nicer to be able to load without removing the cases from the bike, but again, I think that's the problem with Yamaha's design.  Even without Bestem's bags, the problem is the same.  Seems the nifty appearance of the side-opening panniers won out over the utility of a top-opening saddlebag for Yamaha's designers.  Love the bike anyway, and can tolerate the inconvenience.
B000GZWSUO|1|received 2 like decals instead of a left  and  right and after a few e-mails and promises i still didn't get what i paid for i finally gave up and excepted my losses ,no i would not recommend  this company
B003MD3TKK|5|Looks sick af
B004X1TO3G|4|My roommate loves them.
B005ESTYCS|5|This side mirror matches my 2000 2-door black Honda Accord perfectly, and I am very happy about it for the price I paid!
B00L32LWJM|4|It fits perfect and was a good purchase. I purchased this in PA and had to travel to CA because of military orders. It held up fine in the rain and the 3000 mile trip.
B0015PMZN4|5|Exactly what I needed to safely pull carrier bearings off a Ford 8.8 differential. Includes everything you need and pulled the bearings off very easily.
B00BTG0RMU|5|Very good product. Easy to install and works great. The 60CS fit perfectly.<br />I haven't had it long enough to say it's durable.
B000GTX78W|5|Needed a clutch replacement on my vintage Yamaha Seca 750. The mechanic wanted over $300 for the job. I do have mechanical experience with motor driven vehicles and it's recommended you do too before attempting this. With service manual in hand, I replaced my clutch friction places purchased from Amazon for the best price I could find at the time. It is also recommended you replace the steel plates, while you're in there and have it apart. Soak the friction plate in fresh oil that would go in the crankcase for at least 24-48 hours, ensuring the actual friction material is contacting the oil. Stagger the plates so all surfaces are exposed. I soaked mine for 4 days. This ensured maximum life from the part. Saved over $250, enjoy high torque and quick response. Even if you have a mechanic do it, purchase EBC parts for confidence of a quality street part.
B002P8H7QU|4|price was great. shipping was fast. packaging was good. mirror arrived non-broken and works fine. The mirror fit perfectly except that the wire was 3 inches too short. I had to cut the wire from the old mirror and splice it onto this one to get it to work. There was no chance I could stretch it and get it connected without the splice.
B00E1SOZR6|5|Great product
B00F4YHODS|3|This is good to add some quick pockets to your car but getting it to stay on the edge of the seat like is physically impossible since there is no sort of strap or anything to keep it from free swinging so for me it hangs forward in the front seat and provides small storage that can be flipped out of the way easily. Bottomline I probably wouldn't recommend this one in particular but rather one with a bit more storage for the purpose that I am now using it for.
B00AFBXQNC|5|Bought it for my boyfriend. It has a nice sweet candy like smell and its very soapy!
B009DJSP4C|5|Worth the money! These aren't cheap by any means. My Expedition has been running well with these since they were installed!
B0002MB442|3|My car exhaust is smaller than measurements mentioned on article. Anyway, I put this tip and I tested. Surprise, no resonated sound heard at all.<br />In the other hand, it's a pretty nice tip, looks good, but....no resonated sound. It's a shame.
B007VXTQ2C|3|ok
B003ZW8NMW|5|Good
B000CPLWX2|5|I purchased this for a 1999 Ford Contour, it installed in about 5 minutes and works great.  It solved the not starting in the rain problem I was having. I recommend this product.
B000OAG63G|5|Shower head kit is all that it promised to be and more. At first I wasn't sure that the on/off switch was in a convenient place but it has proved to be just right, and, importantly, it provides an easy way to conserve water. This shower head maintains the correct water temp, even when turned off and then turned back on again. The smooth plastic body washes off easily and doesn't show water spots. I'm thinking of getting another one for my sister's birthday.  She'll love it too. Suggestion: I do wish there were an option for buying this product without the hose and fittings.  I didn't really need them because I had ones from an past shower head. Oh well....it's an opportunity to think up an art project using those parts!
B000C8TS9Y|5|Clutch equal or even better quality than oem. Absolutely no problems so far. The clutch itself is made by &#34;exedy&#34; tough, that's printed on the clutch disc I received.
B00X69UBBK|5|Used this on my Fatt & Black 2007 Road King Custom. Perfect .
B000XEBI9K|4|The bumper bully looks,  fits well and mostly does the job, however, I wish it covered a few more inches on each side. A lot of the damage occurs on the corners, the area left unprotected by this guard. Shipping was super fast and the item arrived as promised.
B005DM0OC4|5|A necessary evil if you own a 6.0 liter Ford. Bought for a 2005 F250 and took about 30-40 minutes to install.
B000F79Z7M|5|Great product and easy install....before you remove tape backing, do a dry fit to see how the line up.
B003TQFBIS|5|Keeps the gun working like new.
B0054N8VM2|3|Love the look of the helmet, but too big for me and I couldnt send back because the box got destroyed.
B0009IQZFM|1|Bought this despite the poor reviews, figuring maybe since most of the reviews were older that they may have improved the towel since then.  Nope.  Quite possibly the worst towel I've ever used.  It basically just pushes the water around on my car and soaks up some of it, but doesn't really DRY the car.  It just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air.  My old beach towel worked 100x better.  And I thought Meguiar's was supposed to sell good quality products.  Live and learn, I guess.
B00LTX30MW|2|Works ok not as good as I thought it was
B000CNLCHU|5|Perfect fit,well machined,looks good when you polish it!<br />Bolts included(required).<br />Better that the De Rale  OR Mr. Gaskets spacer kits.
B0065FRBZ6|1|There is not a speck of leather in these bags, despite the description.  (The attaching straps, may be made of cheap thin leather; but  I surely would not trust them to hold heavy tools for very long.)  The rest of the bag is made of a variety of vile-smelling synthetic plastics.  Very stiff, would easily hold its shape.  The attaching straps will be useless without modification unless you luck into a mounting situation that the narrow range of adjustability would cover.  Note too, that unlike some bar-bags that have provision for attaching to either vertical or horizontal supports, this bag will mount only to vertical  bars--like a sissy bar or fork legs--without some cerative alteration.<br /><br />I actually love to modify and fuss over universal parts to get them to work on my bikes.  Buts this bag was not worth the trouble.
B00DBENCZC|1|Disappointed. They were duds , didn't work.
B00DSD5ALU|4|Received this item within the delivery estimate. Sticker looks a little cheap and doesn't seem to be a vehicle quality decal, but I haven't applied yet so not sure.
B00BP5NQG4|5|What can I say they work
B001RV08B2|5|Ordered Helmet through Helmet City via Amazon on Saturday, arrived Tuesday afternoon. No more hassle with glasses.  Built in sun shield works well.  Excellent value.
B0010E3JUI|5|You better change this in your car if your car has them. The first time i changed mine they looked like moldy cakes pretty gross. I then think I was breathing that mess in. The air is a lot fresher in the car after you change them. You save a lot of money changing this your self also.
B00TV6S8ZI|5|Fit perfectly.  Holds starbucks cup perfectly.
B0002KKP9E|5|These pigtails are just what I needed to connect the Grote  LED lights that I Bought for my utility trailer. They work great.
B004RPJWHQ|4|Like the title says, not many notice this item until mentioned, then \\"wallah\\" I think. People love it. just a fun conversational piece....
B009TC9PG0|4|Blows cold as advertised.  Easy to dispense. Will see how it holds up over time.
B00802FZUU|5|They fit nice .. look awsome ... super bright ..
B00EB703PU|5|Great quality heavy duty product, fit fine, work wasnt even bad. Had to call Sixity for a question they were a joy! definitely recommended to anyone replacing axles
B0024NT0IY|5|good product for the price
B00092893E|5|Tried this with my 9 year old SUV V8 Northstar and experienced good results, smoother idling. Put some in my mother-in-law's coffee and it took care of that problem too! I love this stuff!
B000COC0GQ|4|It is difficult to get in the airbox.<br />Had to remove the airbox, insert the filter - close up the airbox and re-install.<br />Should have been just like replacing the OEM filter - it wasn't.
B001EQVST6|5|not much to say here.  just put them in my 2001 Jetta TDI and they are working. the glow plugs should last a long time (4-5 years with my driving and climate) but I cannot comment on durability until they fail.    great price on Amazon and fast shipping. the only thing of note is that I ordered four of them and they shipped from two separate warehouses resulting in two packages but both arrived on the same day.
B00L888TVA|5|Made in Montana. Gave an extra o-ring in case the one size is too big and also included a tether.
B0069A36CY|1|Not at all what I thought it was. It's extremely too small &&& WAY TO expensive for such a size
B0026IW52U|1|If you'd like to just waste money, this product is for you. I see zero difference in lighting. Serious Disappointment!
B000CQ6L5A|2|the ad dances around with words BUT this oil is partially recycled oil....which does give me pause to use in a 30,000 car engine.<br /><br />they, i think, should be right up front with FULL disclosure in the description.<br /><br />when i read the actual label when mine arrived, i have asked to return it.<br /><br />if i had a junk engine, or something less expensive i 'might' run this oil.<br /><br />i would also think that if something did go wrong with an engine, the dealership would take a dim view and perhaps not honor any warranty. again, great pause for concern.<br /><br />will valvoline then stand by an engine failure due to their oil...can you imagine the fight to get resolution?
B00H87FEWW|5|My husband recently purchased an all original Grand National.  He takes if for a ride one afternoon and this cap falls off!  He looked for hours but could not find it and was very upset.  When he found it on Amazon he was thrilled.  When it arrived he was even more thrilled.  His car is now complete and we can rest easy again!
B005UO70ZO|5|Totally surprised my injector stiction stopped completely within about 45 miles.  The truck starts much easier on cold mornings and is quieter than it once was. Runs like it did when new. I think I will keep her another 250k.
B000H6P55W|4|easy to use on top of my Terrain and I did not have the crossbars as shown in the picture but did not have any problems.  No extra straps used.<br />ok for the money<br />not waterproof at all
B000CAW81C|5|Quick service; quality parts;  easy to install; the quality of the bits permeates the product.<br /><br />Will always use this brand!
B002AKFA94|5|Test your skills. How well do you know where the front of your car is? You will find out. This is a very handy product and at bit like coming home to a circus clown.
B007R4L16O|2|Expensive for such a small thing plus the end of the keychain feels like bending every time it goes in my pocket.
B0066QWP96|5|This is the perfect fit for the 2007 Mini Cooper S Hardtop. The plug is perfect and there are plenty of clips to attach it to the speed sensor so it's nice and tight. It fits right into the back brake pad just like it should......enough said. Buy this and save yourself some time and money.
B00KL3ALGO|5|I opened the package and stuck it right on the window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee - easy as that. Other reviews had me nervous about how it sticks to the window, when you open the package it will be obvious. Drove around with my twins this morning to test out the effectiveness and it worked exactly as I wanted - no sun in their eyes.
B000QUXYXE|5|wished these would have originally been put on truck
B004WRK7W8|5|These floor mats are very heavy duty and work like a floor mat should. It catches all wet and dry dirt that you may carry in on your feet. They clean up great and look like new once you have washed them. I would recommend to any and all.
B0010GEBSA|4|I was having voltage issues with my Chevy Malibu. This coil along with a ground strap was the solution to my issue. Good product
B007KFMR8Q|5|This is a great deal ! Thanks it looks good on my car. And also fast service thanks Justin Soler
B00E5IUVYI|2|Daughter bought to clean white fabric nike free running shoes. Did not do much of anything to clean them. The shoes still look very grungy. Could be that this cleaner us not meant for fabric. But, she was disappointed in the result.
B000ZAZ3YS|4|We wanted to get these for our kids seats so the car seats and spilled food wouldn't ruin the seat. They seem to serve their purpose well. They are a great deal for the price.
B00332GCAO|3|Just installed today, so I will need to update this later. It's almost too wide for my cab. The left and right edges hang off onto the curved part of the back of the cab. Maybe that's just how they had to do it, but it seems a little wide.
B004Y8LB7K|5|Fits perfectly! Money well spent 😀
B002K4M3DQ|5|Although this hasn't been tried out yet, my husband just loves this gift.  Everything is as described , now lets just hope it doesn't fall off the motorcycle while riding.
B000VU57YS|5|Great heavy, perfect fit
B00BJCN80M|5|Not much to add about these.  They do the job, and the UFO angle does make is easy to get in those hard spots.  Super soft will not scratch your finish.
B003UY5I0K|5|CAme quickly and met my expectations I would by this product again. No trouble with the vendor or the product
B006X8AUAS|4|Fit my 1984 C10 with no problems.  Clips must be cut off of your parking lights and they don't really attach that well to to new grill but you can make it work.  For $65±, I'm very satisfied.
B00897MDM4|5|exactly what you expect, worked for my 2009 Subaru Impreza 4d 4wd 2.5i ,<br />just wanted to share that quick nugget of info
B000A3GK4M|5|Great product and easy to install.
B0009JKI7W|5|fast shipping and great quality
B000E5XM06|5|Easy to clean and a lifetime filter.  Should keep my mower from getting 'strangled' by a clogged filter.  K & N are SUPER filters.
B0002SR2RY|5|It's a socket.  It's black.  There's a square hole in one end, and hexagonal hole in the other.  If this is what you're looking for in a socket, you won't be disappointed.
B001IDU7XI|5|Amazon needs to rewrite their product description for this item to include Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors.  Despite what their sorting software tells you, this item will fit perfectly between the seats of your CVPI.  I installed it with 4 sheet metal screws and it's more than rigidly mounted.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to other CVPI owners?  You bet!  Excellent quality for the money and more than enough storage space.  I may even mount my CB radio inside the console!
B004X9BT1I|5|Almost unbelievable! $40 versus $260 at Auto Zone. I was not sure, but after replacing many of these in tank pumps, I decided to try.<br />It's been in a 99 Venture van for over a month and works great! Checked fuel pressure after installing it was at 60 PSI. Thanks for saving a ton of $$. Looks exactly like the Delco pump that was in it.
B000EZICII|5|Great car shampoo. Thanks.
B00B3VTKHE|5|Fit perfectly. I'm very happy to have my cup holder back.
B007TYAUDW|5|This product is just great. It's a perfect match  My husband installed it in about 15 minutes and it was dark outside. This price is awesome!  I looked at the local Chevy house and the price was over $300. I looked at Car Quest and the price was over $150.  Shipping was super fast.  I figured about 7-10 days.  I placed the order 6-14-14 and received it 6-17-14.  I just hope I don't have to purchase the matching side!!
B008RZ8PZC|5|good price and fast shipping
B002G29N30|3|good size but a little on the thin side.  My old chamois was a lot thicker.  Did not think to look for thickness.
B0002MSY7C|5|After looking at many different home improvement stores for what I needed and not being successful, amazon.com came to the rescue. This product is exactly what I was looking for and I wasn't one bit disappointed with my purchase!
B004QQLQT8|3|the blade itself is GREAT BUT IT DIDNT COME WITH THE USUSAL INSTRUCTIONS OF HOW TO REMOVE OLD BLADE AND ATTACH NEW BLADE :(
B000H81BUS|5|I received and was very happy with the quality of it, it is made of good materials and put together well. I could not wait to put it on my jeep.
B00FRZMJOI|5|MDXERS! I hit 203,000 Miles. Replaced plugs, and ignition coils. Its running smoother so far. Also MDXers, clean carbon inside intake manifold. Last thing would be replace EGR valve. Easy to do all steps  :)  -  Dave
B001F89Q9M|5|love the tassells
B001KR79Z6|4|It meets my expectation and is inexpensive.
B0017T7WHW|3|Becomes harder to use after about 10 uses.
B00JN0U4SQ|4|Looks kind of cheap but looks decent from far away
B00CIFS5D4|5|Fast shipping from seller. Parts fitted nicely on my harley vrod
B000CFUP9O|4|worked out good fit right no leaks .
B001FAGL84|5|fit great and is built well
B00BMTZRWY|4|I don't know how many stars to give It because I didn't have to use it yet. All I can say is I connected it and it read the cars computer properly. It seems simple to use.
B001E8EK1C|3|Sometimes the sumug of difrent colors show up on TV screen, I do not know why, please suggest if you know. Thanks
B00IAZ6164|5|Product was as described.  Great Price. Fast shipping.  Would order again.
B0009IQZH0|5|good one

B007ROUQ6U|2|AS DESCRIBED, GREAT PRICE FOR 2 BATTERIES
B007KPR93Y|5|This was installed on a 2012 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 classic LT for passenger.  There are 5 different mounting holes, but on this model Vulcan with stock exhaust I was only able to choose from the lower two holes.  This was not an issue though.  Required a mounting adapter for this application. I was quite impressed with the mounting adapter.  It came with two set screws to make a solid mount. Very satisfied with Kuryakyn products. Easy to install and took less than 30 minutes to install.
B0031HEIDY|5|They are good replacements.
B000W0RQ8C|5|I purchased this to secure the CSI W580 winch receiver and shackle combo. High quality and the end cap to cover the lock is a bit of a chore, but once secure no problem. This looks great.
B000CO9VFY|5|This filter provided the very noticeable horsepower increase.  Highly recommended it, much better MPG.
B00BF2V8ZS|4|well built light, not as bright as my kc hilites though.
B00K150ZJA|4|Update on 2/8/16:  I have used this winch a lot on the back of my tractor to help with large, leaning tree removal while clearing my property for our new home.  It has worked in a stellar manner each time used.  One of the last times used was to &#34;try&#34; and keep a ~70' tall oak tree with very large limbs located more on one side than any other, from falling onto/being supported by other trees and creating a very dangerous situation.  This did not work as I could not get the winch wire rope extension high enough to provide enough leverage on this very large tree, along with not being able to anchor the tractor to a tree in the now open, cleared field.<br /><br />In the end the tree went in the direction I was trying to keep it from going as the leaning tree pressure on the winch caused the tractor to eventually crush four large, rubber wheel chocks behind the tractor's tires and started dragging the 7500# tractor with its brakes locked as the tree was very slowly falling away from us.  The winch operator did not notice the tractor was being dragged over the winch control cable and it was ripped from the winch.  The situation then went unrecoverable, quickly.  I have no idea how much weight the winch was supporting as it and the tractor were being drug with what was left of the wheel chocks and with brakes engaged, but am sure at some points it was FAR more than the rated 12,000 pounds before the dragging began.  I have used smaller chocks on the wheels of my Jeep GC with no chock damage with its 9,000 pound winch at maximum pull.<br /><br />In the end the synthetic winch rope was embedded on the winch drum between various layers of rope and sections appeared to be melted/fused together somewhat from all of the heat generated in this greatly overloaded condition.  However the winch nor the rope failed and are still functional.  I need to replace the existing damaged 7/16&#34; synthetic rope with new 1/2&#34; I have waiting and am planning on purchasing an identical Smittybilt winch to replace the 9k unit on my Jeep GC.<br /><br />Original review:  By the time one purchases a less expensive Chinese winch and adds synthetic rope to it, the price is close to this Smittybilt and nowhere near the quality, performance and warranty.  I have not used it yet but will update in the future after I have hauled some cut oak trees up a hill with it.<br /><br />I have just installed this on a portable 2&#34; receiver cradle to use on my tractor's 3PH.  The synthetic rope is 7/16&#34; diameter, which is pretty hefty and all of the components and construction seem to be high quality.  At today's winch prices, I see no reason to purchase anything less than a 10k# class winch for automotive recovery purposes and a 12k# for just a little bit more money is the way to go as a starting point.  I have a 9k winch on my Jeep GC that is ~ 8 years old and feel it is borderline in capacity.  I am not an expert, but the general standard is one needs a winch capacity that is 1.0 - 1.5 times the maximum expected rolling weight capacity of the winched vehicle.  And the greater the winch capacity the better the performance.  I like a minimum of 1.5 times the weight, but all circumstances are different.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Very good quality<br />- 7/16&#34; synthetic rope.  I will not use wire rope for safety and weight reasons.  Possible abrasion of the synthetic rope is not an issue for me.<br />- Waterproof<br />- Reasonably priced<br />- Efficient 6.6 HP motor with 193:1 gear ratio for relatively quick recovery speeds<br />- Excellent limited lifetime mechanical warranty with a 3 year electrical warranty<br />- Excellent remote control with a magnetic portion to latch onto anything ferrous metal.  This will be really handy when using the winch and not having to look for a clean place to lay the remote while using it- just &#34;stick&#34; it on the vehicle.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  There are no instructions on how to install the rope, which is no bigdeal for one experienced in doing this, but would be helpful for a newcomer.  Search the Internet for instructions if you are new to this sort of thing.<br />-  The hook on the rope is permanently attached and rated at 3.1T.  It is a stout looking hook but I would not intentionally purchase a 3.1T hook for a 12k# winch.  There is no easy way to remove this hook and replace with a different one.  I will use it and see how it goes. The professional looking hook on my other winch's synthetic rope has no rating on it at all.  I assume Smittybilt knows what they are doing.<br />-  This is a nit really and not a con, but I was expecting this winch to have a waterproof solenoid box, which it is not.  However, the solenoid is an all-in-one unit that is sealed.
B00DMIGHYU|3|These bulbs required opening up the hole in the foglamp housing of a 2012 Jeep Wrangler with a rotary file in my cordless drill to get them to fit. By my measurements, the holes in the housings were 0.025 In. too small. Or the bulbs were too big if you want to look at it that way. Also, one of the alignment tabs needed to be removed because it was not at all in the correct location. I can see how some folks would not like these bulbs. They really should be plug and play but custom stuff rarely is and I am a mechanic so it was no big deal to me. Once installed correctly, they worked just fine and seemed quite a bit brighter than the stock incandesant bulbs. My customer liked them and will report back if there are any complaints with the light output at night.
B0076HUU00|4|Can't beat it for the price.
B001LHVOVK|5|Works great and saved me a ton on getting diagnostics from the shop and also great to reset and faults !!!
B0083W1A9W|5|Works great.
B004ZG7ENQ|5|Was sceptical to buy this seat but after months of researching I finally did. I'm 6 foot 4 on a 2013 wide glide and this along with my kuryakyn forward controls were the best money I've spent on my bike. The seat makes a huge difference. The back support is great. The seat has a perfect feel to it and narrower up front to allow leg movement. The only downside I see, but I knew it before buying, is the passenger area is a little bulkier than I had hoped, but the comfort quickly makes up for it.
B000UOBIZC|4|Must be used with the leveler blocks, To flimsy to be used by themselves. Light and ok quality.
B000LG8GI6|5|Gd
B00EK59IUO|5|i bought these for my 95 hatch and it did the job 100%. they fit no issues even though my car was in an accident a couple owners back. the bulbs fit right in the lenses. good product.
B008XNZZ7O|4|Good product<br />Will order again. Make with some fragance too
B007TY2RMO|5|Very very happy with this product. Affordable price and Exact replacement very easy to install and it's working like champ.....
B002P8JGT6|5|Works great, cheap too
B0002JMLUQ|5|Bought this to try and help the shifting on my 2001 Volvo S60. These Aisin Warner transmissions are known for their issues and sure enough mine was taking long to shift between gears and forward/reverse. Doing a flush fixed the problems for a while but they seemed to come back after about a year. Adding this to my transmission helped it tremendously. The shifts are quick and without hesitation as they should be. So far I've been running with it for a few months now and all seems well. This may not be a permanent fix of course but it can definitely extend the life and give you some time before a rebuild is required.
B00FJDH600|3|It works but can already tell it's going to break once again
B000CBVKHY|4|Was awsome until -20f weather froze the double sided tape to failure.
B00SSEZBFY|5|It's a bumper sticker
B0016AMF9C|4|Came as described.  Large, as others said, but I'm a big guy and that is what I was looking for.  Works fine so far.
B001OMLEFI|5|Covers a family style roll bar for YJs. It looks good and it feels good. It is a kind of charcoal static like black close up but whatever. I had to make holes for the front bars to attach to the rest of the roll bar but it was easy to just poke two holes. The padding was thin but I don't know what to compare it to and it did make a big difference.
B00C4NO322|5|Great quality and stylish
B000IY6A1G|3|Bought a left and right caliper.  One was perfect and was assembled incorrectly.  Had to dissassemble and remove the caliper mount and install the one from the old caliper.
B003VXRPL0|4|Exellent product
B00BEVZCDE|5|Hubs loved these.  Thank You
B0019WRHWW|5|Works Great!
B002YXQLIG|5|Awesome!  If you plan on selling your boat, then you may not want to spend the extra money on this 238 seat mounting system.  If you plan on keeping and using your boat then there is no better seat mounting system.  I've tried them all and this system is the best!
B0030DCU2U|5|Item was exactly as described.  Installed easily with instructions provided in the package and on-line.  Very pleased not to have paid the dealer $400 to have it done, plus I had the satisfaction of doing it myself.
B0029VERHU|5|years later, im writing this review because I forgot before.<br /><br />very nice items, i recommend to all! and to all a farewell!
B000A8JLIY|5|Great price and they work too
B004X5QSQS|4|Perfect fit. Perfect price. Obv easy install. I just took the top metal bar off the new radiator and it was a perfect fit. Recommended !!!
B00DPJOL44|5|Great
B009CCM6CC|5|Replacement was simple.  Watch a youtube vid if you need to know how.  The finish was slightly different than the original but barely noticeable.  Original has a slight texture vs this one is a flat matte.
B000CO93RA|2|replaced bulbs in my Tacoma with these in May 2013, both burned out already in Jan 2014.  this is the second set within 2 years
B00B7MW0T4|4|Exactly as expected and easy to install
B0062HIN7C|2|I ordered a size medium based on your measurements. A Medium fit more like a xl. other than the size the helmet is nice.
B001GAVGX8|5|Well made!
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Great product....works well.
B0050DCX2A|5|I read the reviews, yes it is plastic. So what, it looks good, installs easily. There is plenty of plastic on your bike now. Why pay an extra $130 for a metal cover, when you can cover up the stock one for so much less. If you follow the instructions, you will have no problem with it falling off.
B000NZPK1G|1|No FIA tags on belts. SFI date is almost  year old. Not acceptable for my SCCA use. Not sure why my shipment didn't have the FIA certification as others in the comments section did.
B00877SL2M|5|Looks great!
B00SW8TJ8Q|4|Very well made light,  haven't installed yet so can't review how it works
B004ZF3JB8|5|Great product, great seller, HIGH QUALITY... HIGHLY Recommended. VERY SATISFIED
B009OBVXDO|4|worked great thanks
B000HEBR3I|5|Superb!  I would recommend this two any one.  Simple to use.  Just put in two batteries in flip the switch.
B00CQC8OP8|5|As expected
B00HVHYX3U|5|rubber guard will definitely protect from the weather
B0048FP53U|4|My dashboard cover fits well and has significantly reduced glare from the black dash.
B004K23KX8|4|The x2o 10, 000 has been a great asset to my jeep! I have used and abused it. I have swamped it out in creeks and mud holes. Used it totally submerged in mud and water several times. The only issue is they should have tig welded the cable to the coupler that bolts it to the drum. And wish the line speed was a bit faster. Other than that no flaws or issues I have been able to find.
B009DK3T4M|4|they not as rigid as the OEM shields but they're effective and installed easy.  they should have come with new clips to install but it was easy finding them from the parts store
B000OB16OY|5|Product was as I expected and in excellent condition, and shipping was about three days, even on super saver! Nice MBRP pipe comes with clamps and instructions.
B0032FTS4E|5|Perfect fit, fast shipping!
B002MY6ZZG|4|Worked to protect the winch hawse.  Holding up fine after many uses.
B00HTRL7K4|5|I love this sticker I have it on my toolbox is very nice I wanted preciate all your of your help
B0015PPWUM|4|lights fit well, their high quality, and they look good. everything i expected. the only issue is on one of the lights a reflector had broken off and fallen to the bottom of the casing but i live in Alaska so it probably happened during shipping.
B00466V9AY|5|I have had this for some time. The only problem I had was the printing on the buttons wore off pretty quickly. But, you come on, not hard to figure out. Red is for emergencies and the other 2, one locks the other does not. So, not a huge deal to me. Especially for the price I paid for it. It was very easy to set up. Just follow the directions that come with it.
B005FJXZE4|5|great brakes for that price
B004U00QR8|5|I got this front set over the hump and it fits perfect for my 2011 CRV. While on the expensive side, it will do the job of keeping my floor from the salt and snow. Well made and shipped on time.Saved me about $30 to order from amazon vs weathertech. I was worried it would be a 2nd because of the cheaper price, if it is I can't tell.
B00004Y61S|5|This is a replacement for my first one which I had for many years, they do wear out over time 15 years and a lot of tows and snatches later it finally gave it up and snapped. Hopefully with this one being made in china it will last as long as my old American made one. it seems to be of the same quality as I compared them so far I have not had to tow or snatch anyone from a ditch but it's only Jan. and more snow is coming tomorrow :) so I'll put it to plenty of use over the next few days while it snows. You'd think people in Michigan would know that snow means even a 4x4 will slide!!<br /><br />UPDATE 2014..<br />O.K. winter got real bad I pulled 100 plus vehicles out of ditch's snowbanks and even they're own driveways. I gotta say this strap is great. I even pulled a county plow truck out of a ditch even though he didn't think a f150 could do it I did it.  recently we had a storm that took out a bunch of treee's so being on call i had to tow a few of them off the road then sit all night at a primary feed power line till the power company arrived love the strap so much I am buying another. well worth the money even if mde in china!!!
B001P4E2W2|5|I have used these on my zx6r, gsxr-600, and now zx10r. They are track proven and just as good as any of the other top name brands for much less price. 3 years of track experience and 14yrs of street experience, this is a great buy and product. I will be buying again for future sportbikes.
B0009V1WS4|5|Works great locks in place as it should. I take care of it and it is garage kept. No rust after 2 years.
B00JAYFBM4|4|I'm glad I got them to protect my new car.  They are adequate but marginally custom for the cost, a little pricier than I liked but good enough quality.  It's not rainy season so don't know about how well they do with water yet.
B00BITW45G|1|it is not  160amp maybe 90amp i am not happy with it
B001O0CAB2|3|I did quite a bit of research in looking to upgrade the look of my 2006 Accord Coupe's headlights. I found that many independent reviewers found the IPCW's to have the most pleasing color and output, so I bought them.  I had Sylvania Silverstar Ultra's in and left one in to compare to the IPCW that I installed on the other side. The color of the IPCW is similar to the Ultra's but does look better. The white seems to have that faux HID look, more so than the Ultra's. Now, lets not kid ourselves here, the IPCW's might have a better look than the $50 ultra's but they are no where near HID quality.  When comparing light output, the IPCW's do have better reach than the Ultra's. I'm not sure why....the Wattage is the same and the ballasts look identical. It could be a mental perception thing - but they do seem to be about 10-15% brighter than the Ultra's.  Overall, for the price they are GREAT!  If you are looking for a strong performance light though...they will leave you wanting more.  Since I purchased the IPCW's, I purchased a new set of lights after talking with the Honda dealer during a routine oil change. He told me that the only way to actually increase light output is to increase wattage. I asked him about wiring issues with upgrading from a 55 watt light to a 80-90 watt light. He told me that import (Honda/Toyota/Lexus/Infiniti) wiring can handle it with no issues. He suggested that Ford/Chevy might have issues however and has seen blown fuses on the American made cars.  I purchased some Hella Xenon 85 watters for my lows and 100 watters for my highs.... and they are fantastic! Wattage makes the difference without question. So, if you are reading this and are wanting brighter lights with higher useable light on the road, go with a higher wattage bulb that will fit your car models light size. These lights are claimed to be \\"off road\\" use only but as a deputy sheriff, I can tell you that these lights do not put off enough \\"stray\\" light to cause concern. This appears to be as good as it gets for non-HID lights.  Good Luck!
B00FSIN0U6|4|have not install .
B006JFR0B2|5|Luv it
B0068FV9EW|5|i had to fix a badly crimp chain connecting link. The bike shop told me it would cost $55 dollars plus the link. I went on amzon and fix my problem for under 20 bucks. Super easy to install and it allows me to remove and reuse the link for service.
B004HIHYQE|4|Easy install, looks great.
B00Q7K3SZ6|5|LOVE IT!
B007M5QH4Y|5|worked great
B000C11JMU|5|Self installed this two years ago.  It's still working perfectly.  Couldn't ask for more!
B00J202W0A|1|NOT STURDY THE AREAS THAT YOU PUSH CRACK VERY EASY
B002OKVGSO|4|This mirror is nearly perfect. Other reviews stated that it shook or left a gap for water to get in.<br />I installed this mirror myself, I'm a 17 year old girl with no experience and it only took about 10 minutes of actual efforts. The mirror fit on my car like a charm, no shaking, no gaps. Matched my 2011 Nissan Sentra 2.0S perfectly.<br />My painted cover was undamaged from my previous mirror so I popped it on the new mirror, this did not fit perfectly. I admit it was probably from my accident or taking it off the old mirror may have warped it. There MAY be space for water to get in, I doubt it will do much harm.<br />It has no noticeable differences from my other mirror, power worked perfectly, as fast and smooth as my OEM mirror.<br />I highly recommend this mirror, install it yourself and save the $100.<br />If you find it shaking, you may just have not tightened it enough or knocked the mirror itself loose.
B00DE3MGXO|5|Nice set comfortable
B001P5SU24|5|Best charger you can buy. Keeps battery up to snuff over the winter and all yr long if you do not have a chane to ride
B003A04IDC|5|Thanks again for your availablity for having the parts I needed.
B004D5XYKQ|1|The hitch cover outside diameter and depth does not fit well in my 2007 Tundra pickup receiver. I bought another from a Toyota dealer here and theirs is much better quality and fit.  I threw theirs away.
B001CJHU9W|3|Works fine for checking tire pressure. If adding air to a tire, the chuck frequently pops off the valve stem. If the hose wiggles just a tiny bit the chuck either pops off or slips so that the valve core is not depressed. The short stem where the air hose chuck goes when you add air is too short which makes it unhandy to use. Checked the accuracy of the gauge with a couple of other gauges and all are within 1 or 2 PSI of each other.
B004VDVO5W|5|Excellent but the small pieces don't fit the Lincoln towncar03 to 11 . I actually only needed the large pieces for the pillars and they fit. So I'm satisfied.
B0001EX1WE|5|Perfect fit.
B00A93UNL4|5|This is a rather large reflective sticker.  I am very impressed and it looks good on the back of my truck window.
B00AC5EV2G|5|this is the best product I have ever bought from amazon I was completely satisfied with the final product and I love the way it sounds on my bike. It truly sounds like rolling thunder when I ride down the street. I love this exhaust they are awsome
B00KTLZRNA|5|This is a reservoir with screen that functions as a filter. I change it every time with steering fluid flush.
B000ALBRGU|5|Now my trunk lid will stay open!<br />Easy to install, even though the truck lid is heavy.<br />Delivered on time and at a fair price.
B000OLA6DG|5|Great shocks, great ride, better life than most, plus they look better, in my opinion. Priced a bit high, but you get what you pay for, and these are worth it.
B002M4GECK|5|They fit great
B005CNNIV8|1|IF U DON'T MIND TO SPEND $123.95 + TAX FOR REFURBISH PRODUCT GO AHEAD .......................<br /><br />OTHER THAN THAT IT TOTAL FIT INTO MY 2013 DODGE CHARGER R/T<br /><br />WINFIELD CONSUMER PRODUCTS = REFURBISH
B005SEKL3O|5|this oil is very unique but if you have an engine that can run thin oil then this is the cat meow.
B00MJ47C2O|5|Just perfect...
B002669U3O|5|Easy installation that made a silly screw up less of a hassle to fix. Luckily my painted cover was undamaged so I was able to swap it out with the one provided so it would match my car.
B000SXCLIS|5|A very durable and nice looking motorcycle cover. Overall, a great deal for the price. So far it has stood up well to the harsh wind, sand, and heat of the California desert. Great fit. I went out of town for a week and left my bike covered up outside. I live in the flat and barren California desert, and it's winday all day everyday. I was worried the winds would rip off the cover, but when I came home it was still snugly covered!
B00LHUI4XM|5|Great product great service
B00042KG3A|5|heavy duty...and large...heavy...get the proper system to brace it to your rack or bumper...
B006H9C6SW|5|Bought this for my 92  300 zx and its perfect. Noticed increased performance and its easy to install. Great product
B000O824Y8|5|I didn't want to use a pine 2x4 and sockets this time around, this kit made it easy and now I know for sure I didn't damage the seal or races. Disc's are made of a soft aluminum and only one disc was a bit too large for my inner race but because the disc is softer than the race there was no damage. Saved me time, worth it.
B000XSGKYO|5|perfect.
B000RGXLG2|5|If you like the way Rain-X works when applied to your windshield (another product I love) then you will like these wipers.<br /><br />It almost seems like with every wipe you get a tiny application of Rain-X.<br /><br />I recommend these wipers for purchase.
B003QJWTYM|5|By far the best tie downs I have ever seen or owned. They are easy to use and store since they automatically roll up into themselves
B00FZQAQHG|5|Exact fit for my 2008 Jeep Liberty. It was easy to install and works perfectly!
B001JECK36|5|I don't have any complaints for my steering wheel cover.  The color is appropriately shown in the picture.  To give a good size of the wheel cover, it very easily fit over the steering wheel of my 2010 Toyota Corolla.  It actually will still move in a circle around the steering wheel (slowly, over time) so it is an easy fit and would definitely be good for larger steering wheels as well.
B003UT6LCO|5|I contemplated buying this for awhile and finally bought it a year ago for my 2005 Toyota Tacoma. Also bought one for my moms Toyota Rav4 last month. No regrets. Though the oil may not drain as fast as before, I still like it. I've done two oil changes since installing this and it's super easy to pop open and close back up..
B001EOV45G|5|Amazing quality . Its fits well : Suggestion instead of fitting the way shown in the product pictures , fit it horizontally i.e. the T connector dust connector on the size instead of below the hitch opening
B0009H51MG|5|Does the job.
B0002NYE0M|5|This thing is awesome, it works great and is easy to handle. I would recommend it to anyone, if I had a lot of machines to greese at a time I would get the 18 volt but only because the battery time would be longer, but I only have a skid loader and a few other machines and I'm very satisfied.
B000BYB7H0|5|This motorcraft cop was a great replacement . My car runs just as good before cop went bad . I wud highly recommend this for 2004 mustangs gt.
B000EJTI4G|5|This is a replacement charger, other has given me over 4 years of excellent service. One of the best features is the battery checking. Love the 3 ranges for charging. I do a lot of gel cell batteries that can not take six or twelve amp charge rates, Would recommend this charger with confidence.
B007YVQ0UC|5|Excellent product. Fits exactly as described, and fast shipping.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Awesome product! Bought for a long trip in the car for my infant and they easily pull off and reattach wherever we needed it to go.
B000EVWDAK|4|I'm very Happy for this product ,it help me a lot ,and save me a lot of money, But there is one thing the issue of this Product is not available to MAC Computer, it's only PC, other than I Recommend this BRAND.
B00O1UHGUM|5|happy with produce
B008P6XDBY|5|Fit great as long as you get tight they don't seem to move around.
B000EVWDU0|5|Fast shipping and great monitor.
B002MQCY7C|4|My only advise when installing is to install OVER the D-rings instead of under. I say this because I can't find a way to remove the quick release from my helmet without totally destroying the quick release. When it's on, it's on for good.
B00CBQFE8E|5|These are perfect! I purchased some wheels for my car and didn't feel like tearing out the TPMS system from old wheels and tires. These where half the price of discount tire and they installed them for free when I had them put new tires on my wheels. They were no hassle, and worked right off the bat.<br /><br />They fit great on my 2014 Mustang GT.
B000COBLJI|5|On time delivery. Notably better quality of light than the standard 55/60 watt bulb for my 2005 DynaSuperglide with  the road illuminated quite a bit further and better vision w/I the beam pattern.
B004HCM9H4|5|Love this product.  Use it on my cars regularly.  This purchase was just to replenish my supply.  I highly recommend this wax for good protection and shine.
B003VDX5D2|4|Needs a better clip to attach it to tailgate to prevent rattling when driving. Other than that it's very functional.
B0023058PM|3|I bought for my Honda 750 shadow spirit c2. Definitely to big width wise, alot tucking, but i needed to cover my air hawk cushions, i wasn't sure what all this rain we been getting would do to my cushions while at work. So for the money and peace of mind i purchased. Better than to small i guess.
B00FP0LHA2|2|The plug does not fit very well in iOS devices. It is a very snug fit and not easy to fit into the device.
B00COYNZJ8|5|This makes my 2005 Honda Accord look epic!... When it's parked in the sun, not recommend while driving. ;) I purchased a few more for my family, and friends during Christmas, and they all love them.
B000GTUMFI|5|Orange went on the bars
B002QH5FI2|5|I love these frames. All black feels very classy to me and they are hard to find in stores. I have been very satisfied with this purchase!
B004L6FICE|2|this part does not fit the 2003 Mitsubishi Galant ES, Even though the Amazon website states that it does. This part looks almost identical to the one that's on the car, With the exception that the bolt holes are too small on this part from Amazon.
B000JZCZ9A|5|This hub assembly was an exact fit for my girlfriend's 06 Civic LX 1.8L. Though amazon does not classify this as a working piece for the 06 Civics, it is. I did a lot of digging to discover that this assembly is the exact same as a Moog hub assembly. Moog took over this brand a few months back so if you are looking for the best hub assembly out there, this is it. Installation took me about 25 minutes from jacking the car up until tightning the lug nuts back on. I have a lot of experience with working on cars so for the beginner or intermediate DIY-er, i would plan on about 1-1.5 hours from start to finish.
B0089FGFGQ|3|Ok product for the price, &#34;leather&#34; feels very thin, knuckle protection seems sufficient, but doesnt seem to fit quite right. For the amount of riding i do these days, they are sufficient.
B00HAJV5WG|1|sticker is only 2 by 2 usable inches. And does not peel off backing.
B005CDNCQO|5|fixed my service engine light
B004LV2WB4|5|Look great like the oem
B00429NKWK|5|Did a really nice job. It all looks for naught till the last step.
B00318NVRM|5|bought these for my 2007 toyota yaris. quick and easy install. product arrived quickly and had not visible signs of damage. thanks amazon!
B009DJNN4O|5|Perfect fit.
B00KGPBEE0|3|Was shipped promptly and arrived in a timely manner. One of the bulbs was defective and flickered off and on. Tried the other bulb in the same socket and worked fine. They are quite bright, but the ice blue is a bit darker than in the picture. I'll try ordering another set and see if I have better luck.
B00FGK86QE|5|Happy with purchase.
B0099QJ0O8|5|What can I say...they work beautifully. I bought them as a replacement for my previous HID bulbs which were giving me trouble (sometimes not firing right away and some dimming). The first thing I did was install a HID harness to wire the bulbs directly to the battery as opposed to the stock headlight switches as most people do. After that, I installed these bulbs and they're very bright and fire (turn on) right away, every time. Great buy especially for this price.
B000GU3KHO|5|I was looking for a cover for my Honda Shadow Aero that wouldn't break the bank.  This one has turned out to be an awesome find.  It's a lil thin, but seems to be strong and is working out very well.  Will definitely buy another one when its time...
B001A6ULZC|5|This shield is really great! It's tint is excellent for those hot sunny days right around the corner. Goes good with the Bell Arrow Matte Black!
B004AGEL82|5|Very high quality coated rotor, no issues again top quality.
B001KS3VMK|2|Don't fit !!!!!!!
B00ANP3BIU|5|great factory part
B000UFGJ8C|4|I used this with an orange cutting pad, and followed up with the Klasse AIO and SG products.  This did a great job of removing the swirls and really bringing back the Sapphire Black color, and my car looks great.  It was a bit of effort, and I did go over some areas more than once, but it does a really nice job.  My car is 11 years old, and had lots of swirls due to auto car washes, and this was the first time I used a polish on it.  Will definitely add this to the annual list of chores.<br /><br />Side note - if you have water spots, you may need something stronger to remove.  I wasn't able to remove the water spots on my car.  Who knew they were so hard to get out?
B00IETRT8A|5|Just installed these step motors last week. With the instructions i found on line.installation went easy. Gauges work again. Speedometer was the only one that was messing up but replaced all gauges while I had the cluster apart.
B0048G21OK|3|I almost returned this because I bought it to block the glare from the sun and while it seems to help some it doesn't completely remedy the issue... haven't had enough sunny drives to fully factor that part, but I have seen the reflection of the carpet in the windshield instead of the dash as I used to, which is a bummer...yet I think the carpet is slightly more transparent than the dash was...  It fits the dashboard but not ideally, I have mine just loosely on with three small pieces of the tape. I wasn't thrilled about applying the velcro to the dash and it would take another person and an hour of frustration to attempt to get it on the dash perfectly, which may not be exactly possible as it's not seeming to lay perfectly, though it's clearly the correct one and molded after my dash shape. I thought with time and laying in the sun and such it might rest a little more accurately, but so far no change. I think of it kind of as a dust trap...but figure I can vacuum it like the rest of the upholstery.  I guess I'm underwhelmed. I feel like an old fogey with my safety inspired dash carpet..but I had good intentions.... now to order my special glare reducing sunglasses instead, ha ha.
B0045G09TC|4|The product came within the time frame that was given, but do think it toke a little long for such a small item it is of good quality so I'm happy with the over all purchase
B004K7VNDC|5|We didn't have any problems and it's the exact same thing sold in your local automotive store except it's a LOT cheaper
B00GC8RSG8|5|Yes right on!!!
B00FQ0ROZS|2|the light works. pretty bright but is a flood light NOT a spot light!!! I guess i will use them somewhere but is worthless for driving. pretty unhappy to say the least...
B0080CDDO0|4|Wheel cap fit in 2006 VW Alloy wheels (charcoal 5 double spine)
B00DJ68I2E|1|I did a boatload of prep of the floor.  used their cleaner, dried everything, and mixed per the directions.  Let it dry while I was gone on a trip for a week.  Then came home and left the garage open each day for 3 days in 75F - 85F temperature and about 20% - 40% humidity.  In my book, it should be nice and dry.<br /><br />Scratches easy, and when I wiped up some automatic transmission fluid I spilled I mopped the floor with simple green and water at a ratio of about 7:1, water to Simple Green.  Well the floor went dull, and where the ATF was the floor paint bubbled!  Look for something else my friends...
B000BZJE9C|4|Product seems to work great for my BMW 325i e46. Installed quickly and worked on first shot. It did not include the o-ring, but I was able to reuse the original ring.
B000GZX73G|5|Quick shipping and good product
B004I0TFEU|5|The taillight was a perfect fit. I was concerned it might not match the other taillight because of the low price. but it looks like the orginal
B000IYEMBQ|1|Replaced both front wheel bearings in '05 Nissan Murano in November of 2011. One or both replacement bearings (TIMKEN HA590046) have failed after a little less than 11,000 miles, and 16 months - warranty is 12 months. I paid over $250 with S&H - could have saved a lot of $$$ and bought cheaper, but thought I was paying for quality. You might as well buy cheaper parts, since the pricey ones fail just after warranty anyway!!!
B005C1B6LO|5|It arrived quickly.  Its thin though it seems durable enough.  I haven't put it on my vehicle yet so I a not sure about the adhesive tape.  All in all it is pretty bad ass.
B000C16XL2|4|This part would be a 5 star if only it wasn't the 3rd time in 5 years that I have had to buy it.  Fortunately, I still think that I save $$$ by buying it from Amazon and installing it myself.  I only wish that it would last longer than 2 years.  As for the product itself, it is exactly what you need to fix a broken window regulator in a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado.  I admittedly have no automotive repair skills, but I was still able to replace the part in less than 30 minutes.  The first time took about 60 minutes.<br /><br />All in all, good product, shipped quickly (arrived 2 days even though I picked standard shipping) only wish that it could last a little longer.
B00068XCQU|5|Got the battery tender to keep my kids truck charged.  Also use to keep a scooter and van battery charged when not in use.
B0007M306W|5|This will fit on the Reese interchangeable ball set also.  I use it on mine.  I was willing to try it at the cost.  It works
B000UODGIY|5|I would certainly re-buy this block/pad system again.  We've had it now for over a year I believe and I have been very happy with the pads and this &#34;stop&#34; is also very handy, works and eliminates a bit of anxiety of driving off the blocks.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|I like how it folds up small. Do wish the storage bag was stitched a little better. I can see that it will want to tear with use, but still for the price, I am quite pleased with the quality.
B002KT5ZPO|5|I live in Denver and we have 25 feet of uninsulated ex piping running in our basement.  The temperature usually dips below zero 5-10 days a year and last year we had our pipes freeze and a connection to our bathroom sink pop off.  Luckily I was home to minimize the mess but the need for pipe heaters was clear.<br /><br />After procrastinating for 9 months or so I finally pulled the trigger on this product days before a sub-zero cold front hit.  Installation is very straightforward and the interface with Easy heat 10802 plugs worked perfectly.  Instead of the thermal plug which turns on the pipe heaters at 50 degrees, I opted for the Etekcity ZAP wireless remote to control the outlet manually.<br /><br />I got everything installed the day the cold came in and the trial by fire went flawlessly.  I left the product on for five days until temperatures climbed over 32 and had no issues with my pipes.  This combo has proven to be a very economical way to solve a potentially expensive problem.
B002TWY6SO|5|well this sticker is perfect for my zombie obsession and sticker obsession, i put it on my laptop cover instead of my car and love it. great product. do buy :)
B0050D1NF8|4|This has become my nine year olds favorite necklace, all his friends at school think its awesome. The quality is good for the price, would buy again.
B003IHPR4G|2|Not very sturdy... Kinda disappointing
B000GV1UFM|5|Worked how it was supposed to, nice fit and finish of all the parts. Worked for my dirt bike and my chainsaws. I would recommend it.
B000GU24HG|2|Basic cover
B008B03LKC|4|These are so cute, but of course they are so small, I'm probably the only one that knows they are there. I love them anyway!.
B006B7YLX8|5|Very nice install. Took twenty min. Fits well. Small horsepower gain,and better sound.Matched with 3&#34; exhaust with a Magnaflow muffler its really nice. 22.5 MPG highway. Before my truck was getting 18.5 MPG. Get it dont look back. you'll love it!!!!!
B002XRGX5E|5|Fits 96 Tahoe perfectly.
B0057V3ZEA|5|I give them five stars but I broke them 5 days after installation my bike was knocked over and I don't have frame sliders
B00KJGPMZI|4|A bit complicated to use but we're really happy with the performance. They've stayed paired almost all the time.
B000B8LKZ0|5|I bought this item to use on my 2001 Buick Regal LS..it fit just like the orginial OEM..WOrks perfect so far....I would recommend.
B00JU65OP6|5|We love our Sun Blaster, makes driving into the sun so much easier!
B000IOKU12|5|This is one of the best features I have added to my bike one of my co-workers told me it was a must for me to get and he was right we both work and ride bikes for the Sheriff office this is a must if you want to enjoy your ride gives you extra comfort while keeping the bike safe
B005DPDYV4|5|They have been on my car for a month-did not get loose or chip or fade.  Very great accent to my black rims!  Wish they had a few more deisgns available but these'll do!
B000COB440|5|It'work great
B005E3AD1O|1|The key received is not the OEM GM key displayed in the photo.  This key is a generic knockoff without the GM logo.  Not happy with discount key.!
B001LHVOVK|1|No Battery needed.  It runs from connector power.<br />When my engine light came on, I order this code reader from Amazon with next day delivery. It is very simple to use with only an Enter and Scroll button.  Just plug it into you socket (usually under the steering wheel) with the ignition off.  Then turn on the ignition,but do not start the engine.  Now press the Enter button and when it reads the results use the scroll button to access the different menu options.  Use the enter to select the menu item.<br /><br />It found my error code P0171.  When I fixed the problem, I used the code reader to erase the error code and turn off the engine light.  It also reads the Ready Codes.  After the problem is fixed, these Ready Codes will re-set automatically after you drive for a few days.  As I understand, these codes must be re-set before you take the Smog Test.<br /><br />Review Update:  This item stopped working after a few months.  I would NOT buy this product again.
B005FL5GEE|5|I was looking for a replacement set of front rotors and pads for my Pilot. Everywhere I looked I found either stock replacements or extremely expensive aftermarket makes like Brembo. I needed an economical alternative that performed well. And that's when I found Powerstop. After the initial break in period these brakes stopped faster, smoother, quieter, and sooner than stock. Best part is they look great and with there coating stay looking good too!
B000CP0KHG|5|We use these in our business for balancing 12&#34; wheels and tires and find them to do a great job.
B000C1LLPA|5|excelent product
B0000AXQPA|5|Works great! Does not stick out as much as I thought it would which is great. I recommend this, worked great with my Boss stereo.
B00JVHLS3G|1|Poor quality. Bought this within two weeks the white had faded to a cream/ugly off white color. The adhesive also came unglued within about 3-3.5 weeks.Fortuantely I was using this for a project and not on my car, but if I had bought this for my BMW I would be really upset having such a piece of junk on a nice car.
B006QMKXU8|2|Online ordering system led to this model for 2012 WRX. Did not fit my application,I had to send them back
B003BDW0TM|5|great
B003VLBPJA|2|I ordered two of these nets for the explicit reason that they had plastic hooks. Unfortunately the nets I received had metal hooks like most of the others. The seller was apologetic and graciously refunded my money.
B001OMVCIC|5|So far I like these Air Lift 60818 rear air springs. I installed them in my 2010 Ram 1500 Quad Cab 4wd about a week ago. Installation took about 45 minutes total, following the detailed instructions from commenter Maury (THANKS!), although it might have been quicker if I had attached the lines before installing the bags in the springs. Even so, it wasn't difficult. I just jacked the rear end up, put jack stands under the frame near the lower trailing arm mounts and let the axle down until the rear springs were fully extended. Folded the bags and 'fished' them in between the coils (by hand, no tools needed). removed the caps and made sure the bags re-inflated. Slipped the upper spacers in and attached the lines. It took quite a bit longer to run the lines and install the Air Lift Controller II (See my review). To be honest, I haven't had a chance to tow with it since the install, so I can't comment on that, but will update this review after I have towed a load with it.
B000KLZG3U|5|Amazing...Concentrated, I got 2-3 times the amount of washing I could do with the same amount of Meguiars Ultimate Wash and Wax...smells great and leaves a nice cleanliness that is ready for waxing
B00GOQFDQA|4|Nice saddlebags.  Seem to be good quality.  Were a little difficult to install under the saddle due to the thickness of the straps overlapping and making the saddle hard to get back into place (although the saddle set up on the Honda Shadow is a little less forgiving and adaptable than other systems I saw). Once in place, the volume is good and the bags are secure on the motorcycle.  I am glad I installed these on the bike.
B00335HNJU|4|These floor mats are great products for fit and color match. This item however is for the ISLE between the rear bucket seats (second row). THE PICTURE SHOWS THE SECOUND ROW MAT. THIS IS NOT A 2ND ROW MAT...... Again after receiving the correct item I'm completely satisfied .  Amazon makes returns a breeze.
B00AYJK02K|5|This was purchased for my husband's Trailblazer that was second hand and did not include it's remote.  He had it programmed in a minute and it seems to be durable and have great range.  The price was so reasonable he is thinking of getting another one as a backup for the set of spare keys.
B00MH56BHC|4|We have many adult jerseys but this is the first youth purchase. I got a girls small for my 5 year old. She typically wears a 5 or XS. This almost didn't fit. Quality is awesome just like every other Fox product I have purchased unfortunately the garment runs extremely small.
B00IWEV104|5|worked perfect good quality
B000FRLO9Y|5|High quality charger and maintainer, and it can also desulfate batteries that have been discharged.    For this price, it would be nice if it came with the \\"optional\\" cigarette lighter adapter.    Also ideal for preventing loss of power to your car's Electronic Control Module (car's \\"brain\\") so as to avoid the ECM having to re-learn short and long term fuel trims, etc...
B00062ZOFS|5|I just installed the K&N filter in my car yesterday.  I havent driven it all that much, but i did notice a drop in engine vibration when i was sitting at red light.  Its just an air filter, i dont expect much noticable power output.  Im just hoping for better mpg and over all engine cleanliness.    Also, im being eco friendly because i dont ever have to use another air filter Ever Again.  I will keep recycling this one.    Best    Kevin
B00H9S71LW|5|Amazing packed with a lot of features for troubleshooting diagnostic issues with my daughters 2007 Seabring.
B00AOIM2CC|4|I was happy that I was able to get this scan tool to work with DashCommander and my Ford Powerstroke.  (among other products).  My only negative was two things.  The LEDS are bright and blind you at night and the unit doesn't power off so you have to remove it after every trip so you don't run your battery down.  Gets old plugging and unplugging every time you get in the car.  Other than that I have really enjoyed keeping tabs on my truck!
B003Y8NTFS|3|Average product
B002UC4TJO|5|Bought two of these, one to replace the broken one and another for backup.  Fit existing holes on closet wall. So easy to install.
B004UBUTYM|5|I Just installed this in my 2013 R/T and I have to say I love it. The sound from this thing is incredible. It also feels like I found a few extra ponies at higher rpms. Packaging was very good and all pipes and hardware arrived in excellent condition.<br /><br />Just a few notes on my experience installing this:<br />  1- There may be clearance issues between the exhaust and the aft cross member (the stamped steel one, NOT the aluminum one for the transmission) which will sound like a metallic vibration or &#34;buzz&#34;. In my case, no matter how much I tweaked and adjusted, the noise persisted and I had to place some washers between the cross member and body at the mounting studs for a little extra clearance and the noise went away.<br />  2. It may be necessary to remove the rear fascia before you begin to remove the old exhaust . In my case I couldn't get enough room to move the exhaust rearward to get it out. Also a large plastic or rubber mallet for persuasion is very helpful to help get the exhaust pipes apart.<br />  3. Use ONLY silicone spray for the exhaust hangers, NOT WD-40. The reason is WD-40 will cause the rubber to degrade and shorten it's service life.<br />  4. Download the color instructions from Corsa's website.
B0045UY8I6|5|I installed these blades a week before a heavy wet snow storm and these performed flawlessly!!!!! the best wiper blades I ever bought!!! no streaking or ice/snow build-up at all.
B003YCINNM|1|Returned them. Cheap and cheesy
B001GH5P6U|1|this part is no correct for the nissan Pathfinder 2005
B0083W1FV0|1|Let me start off by Saying i have installed around 8 pairs of hids so this was not a error on my end.<br /> The HID kit looks to be of good build wiring for the most part looks pretty good quality.<br /> Heres my issue never in the rest of my installs have i had to hook up grounds or hot wires to my battery everything was plug and go, being i have good general knowledge with wiring all in all its not to big of a deal just more work. I hate the fact that i had to connect both hids together and run a wire behind my radiator, but still not so bad. After all work is done i check my grounds my hot all my connections i turn the truck on and to my surprise nothing, not even a flicker. Once again i checked all my wiring and everything looks ok. Be careful when ordering this product it may be worth it to pay a couple of dollars extra to have less aggravation.  Its been 2 days and I cant get this figured out.
B00R91OOJ6|5|It was pretty easy to install and still sticking on so good so far.
B00I0H27EW|5|EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS, THANK YOU!
B001CEG96C|5|I had a Saab 9-2x Aero that I needed a replacement cabin air filter.  I really like these.  I definitely felt like I noticed an air quality difference once I replaced the old one.  Most people dont replace these often enough.  The previous owner of the car must have gone a few years without replacing it and it affected the airflow as well when I used the AC or vents.
B00236XLA0|5|Quality material, looks much cleaner vs. the plastic white dealer plates.
B00450FLAU|5|Bought this for a White Elephant christmas gift. My 11 yr old nephew got it. He and his cousins thought it was the BEST gift ever.  They said it worked great.  The adults all thought it was plenty loud!
B007K8LOJ6|5|Product fit great in my car... Quick shipping and price was very reasonable... Great seller
B002OMVSCG|4|Installed easily on my Dodge ram 2500. Looks great. Only complaint is that it is not centered perfectly.
B000CJ04B4|5|Exactly as described
B002O95M3K|4|this product works well for my 2012 GMC Terrain and is also easy to install so check if you need it for you HID installation on your vehicle....
B0045MYEQ0|5|perfect!  I would recommend it to anyone!
B000C9CBPQ|1|It was nothing wrong with the one i had. Just kept it.
B009FU6O24|5|BILSTEIN I LOVE YOU
B00KQEHHPG|5|Ordered on Thursday, got the pack on Saturday just in time to do Oil Change.  My 2013 JSW TDI requires oil that meets VW 507.00 standard and Total is one of the 4 approved oils available in the US.<br />It costs about the same as the Castrol LL03 which i have been using until now.  No difference noted during engine operation.<br />Castrol LL03 is a green colored oil while this is just lilght gold colored.  Not sure why that is but it doesn't really matter.  My oil gets dirty within 100 miles of oil change and it stays black for the remaining of the OCI.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants excellent product at an good price.<br /><br />Approved VW 507 oils.<br />Castrol Professional LL03 5W30 (VW Dealerships)<br />Liqui Moly Top Tec 4200 5W30 (Napa may have it, if not can order it)<br />Motul Specific 5W30 504/507 (Some VW dealerships/ebay)<br />Mobil 1 ESP 5W30 (PepBoys)<br />Total Quartz INEO 504/507 (ebay)
B00083B84G|5|I bought one for my self. A good buddy had a heart attack I gave him mine. Then I bought the one from Amazon. He just passed away I got it back. Now I am keeping the first one and giving the second one to my son.
B004B61B34|5|Very easy to install and works good
B001P2GZZG|4|these tips were exactly what i needed . cheap and functional , looks good as well . the price is definately right to boot.
B00HJ6O4A0|2|This had a very strong plastic smell when we first got it. I had to wash it several times and air it out outside for days. The concept is good, but I would buy one that is made out of different materials next time.
B000C7ZRBI|5|This part fixed my problem with not being able to start the vehicle using the key, I would turn the ignition on, then jump the solenoid with a screw driver.  The part was easy to install, and worked great once installed.  And this switch also fixed the back-up lights too.
B0083G3AXC|5|Fits on caravan sports infinity zero gravity chair very well.
B0010E3JUI|5|This filter fits very well, seems to be as well made as stock honda filters and has carbon in the mediem.
B00CL0ZTHG|5|It does the job I wanted it to!
B00HYIKEKW|5|Great faucet up-grade for RV showers, works and looks very well.
B004EIBWQ0|2|I purchased this to charge my older battery, the charging process seems to happen as expected. When I plugged in and clamp on the battery, it slowly charge from 85% to full in a couple hours. Unfortunately, my battery still died in a couple weeks. Luckily Amazon offers the free return policy and I got full refund for this charger as I need the money for a new battery.  If the battery is old, you need a new battery, not a charger.
B0048CLZRS|5|Looks and sound very nice!<br />little bit in a high end on cost but worthy the moneys.<br />Highly recommend to anyone looks for exhaust system.
B00F68HKHM|5|Just amazing !
B00IT6VVZU|5|Awesome
B000I66JEM|5|OMG I LOVE THIS THING.  I keep cash and a spare key in it and nobody knows its there.  VERY heavy duty, well-built.
B0053P69IO|5|Fit perfectly.  A bit of a pain to remove, modify, and re-install the big plastic undercover on my 2013 Toyota Sienna,<br />but the hitch bolted right in to my Van with the bolts supplied by Curt.<br />P.S. -- I had U-haul install the hitch on my old 2004 Sienna, and their solution (unknown to me at the time) was to remove and dispose of the undercover.  If you want something done right - do it yourself !
B00540KPS8|5|This is a great accessory, holds soccer balls, foot balls and other beach stuff  It's easy to open and to grab things out of and fits the bed perfectly.
B002I1EDT8|5|This is a fun little sticker.  Held up well to heat, cold, and rain.  High quality vinyl that gives everyone a good laugh.
B000COS8FI|5|Moroso tire pressure gauge was what I expected and intended for use. Ease of use and accuracy was key to my acquiring this gauge. Performs very well.
B000O3TC8O|5|These were perfect for my 6.0 ford.  The instructions were easy to follow and install.  The studs seemed to be very high quality.
B00C5QYGRA|2|Item was not clearly described.  It fit, but not securely, and would not remove bolt.
B0031BUMJO|5|fit perfect
B0073MFKA8|5|got here quicker than I was expecting, I put it in and it is a direct match for the one I pulled out, except no holes in the wrong place. Everything lined up perfect
B000VYH666|1|very dissappointed
B004FGY6HI|5|it's exactly what he wanted for his 4 wheeler for deer hunting. very satisfied. he has used it now for over a year with no problems
B000C9MXLS|5|works
B001N80918|4|Good item for those wanting to use it as a quick seal. It worked perfect on my roof repairs. I would recommend this product.
B0009IQZJS|5|Does an excellent job as a &#34;solvent trap&#34;.
B00L7E80IW|3|Not like Tempo
B00K0JAO6G|4|These are great gloves. For the fit, i am glad that i bought a large size (I would say i have average size hands for 6 foot). I was not too sure if that was going to make them bulky and hard to get a feel for the throttle but they worked out great. Sure they are bigger and harder to feel / do things in, but that is what you should expect from warm weather gloves.<br /><br />The orange color is good for when you are simply waving people on or making yourself known. Has no interference with the grip whatsoever.<br /><br />The material is well put together and lasts. The stitching is great!
B00G9W95BI|5|Use super glue to secure plastic part to grenade soo it doesn't fly off after awhile of driving
B005VLMOUW|5|I got this to ride around town with my husband.  Fit is nice, and easy to get on and off.
B008DUMQ4M|5|fits perfect. material is cool. not sued but classy not cheap carpet. worth the price. again, perfect fit. will but one for other cars.
B006N94BWU|5|They fit 95 zj limited 5.2L v8 don't be afraid of the price for two of them i am kinda lucky it came with two i only needed one for the driver side link but when i was trying to get it lined up with the sway bar and get it on i kinda screwed the threads up on it so what i did was said whatever and got it all lined up correct with the one i screwed up the threads then switched out with the other it came with and it went on no problem so i was kinda lucky the price i paid for two of them people are buying one
B00EJRF9T2|2|Everything is plastic to fit it to the car.  Set screw area on the plastic cracked, not very secure.
B007Q1DQHK|5|If you own a 2003 - 2006 Silverado or GMC, and the Heating/A-C stops working. This is probably the problem. They short out (condensation from plugged A/C drain line ) or resistor burns out. Easy replacement. A few screws, a couple of plugs, and you slip it in.
B000YE6SS0|1|Do not let the attractive price lure you into the \\"UGLY\\" quality!  After 2 bad units I finally went with a brand!  Amazon should reconsider offering these low quality units that are so safety critical!!!
B00BLZ93T2|1|All labeled in Chinese. Didn't receive any instructions. Not the item pictured - close but different enough to not be able to hook up. Never could figure out the winning combination to get a signal out on the NO connection. I thru mine in the trash - useless.
B006QQGBHS|4|Great fast shipping and everything perfect !!'
B00G0KRHKK|2|These are quit strong for my taste but do smell good
B009D3SEB2|4|The paint wasn't an exact match to my car's color ('04 Camry) - it was a bit lighter. Easy to use. The bottle comes with both a pen tip and a small brush, which is convenient.
B000OV9JHK|1|This was not as pictured, it was a piece of junk. I'm very disappointed. The connector was a different color as well, which means it will not mate with the red one I was trying to connect it to.
B00ET2C4BI|5|Went on easy and does its job perfectly, I would recommend this product.
B00C890GBO|5|Fits well, reasonably priced. Pretty happy with it, owned Vega for years
B006FUT09G|4|good product
B007XZK8NY|5|God
B001PLYWAM|5|Works well so far, easy install, looks nice
B004EKYB7U|5|These knobs were a perfect fit on my 2006 tundra, I have had these on the truck for some time now and they are still holding up great. Just as good looking as factory!
B002R0XT9K|2|Metal clip doesn't secure the plastic ends of the side marker to the headlight housing resulting in a loose fit and rattling. Very disappointing, but for the price manageable with a little fabrication.
B000CFS00U|4|The item arrived quickly from the vendor, the instruction manual was not the right one, went online to the Airlift site and downloaded the right instruction manual. The product itself was of quality and had all the needed pieces to put the unit on the truck. The end result turned out great. I did have to add a 3/8&#34; flat bar spacer to make the alignment of the top bracket work. You do have to drill 4 - 3/8&#34; holes in the frame for the top bracket. For the lower brackets that fit on the top of the rear end & shackles you may have to cut the U-bolts down to create enough space so the bottom bracket is not sitting on top of them. to do a quality job you will want to take your time and get the alignment of the air bag right.<br /> The one other thing it where to put your air supply fittings, ,I opted for a manual filling and air adjustment method. I routed each airline down the inside of the frame to the rear of the truck, utilized the 2 bottom holes on my license plate to mount the left & right air shrader valves. It really worked out nicely.
B0000UUX52|5|Works great
B004AFTDC2|2|both lids leak.. very disappointed.
B005NLQAHS|1|Sometimes causes the check engine light (and others) to come on. Probably fake hardware, even with &#34;Fulfillment by amazon&#34;.
B001UJB7MK|5|GREAT SOUND , GREAT PRICE.<br /><br />i always change mufflers on my vehicles cause not only sounds great but it saves me gas. by 25%<br /><br />thanx flowmaster & amazon
B00076RLB8|5|Holiy hitch !!!! Just wanted to put a fishing basket in the front of my truck ! You could tow a tank with this think ! Well worth the money .
B001QWTT6C|3|Okay, but small than I thought
B00CRM2MWS|5|Very easy to put on. Stays on the seat and doesn't move when you get in and out of the car unlike some other sideless seat covers.
B000CGFS0Y|5|works great
B000IHI80O|5|Good, solid product that worked great.  Instructions could be clearer about the fact there's 1 tube that's ALWAYS used, and then you use one of the remaining 2 depending on your vehicle, and that the drain adapter just pries straight out, but is rather difficult the first time.     Oh, and tech support warned me to not pour the oil OUT too fast or it can get up into the air vent and spray out next time under pressure.    Pros: functioned perfectly, durable, easy to use, quick suction, stable    Cons: instructions not great, hard to remove drain adapter first time, tubes can pop out while moving them around (I've learned what not to do now), can't hold my M-series' full 8.5 quarts
B000182DPG|5|I cant attest to any power gains but I do like K&N's product line. I have a K&N filter in all of my vehicles.
B004A34G94|4|I can not &#34; love &#34; a amp board but I like it a lot.  It was easy to install and works great like you would expect it should.  It would have been nice if it would have included a an end for the large wire as it was hard to find that size.  I went to an RV service and they gave me out of their repair supply.
B001M581A8|5|They send plenty, these have always worked for me.
B0058E201U|5|My husband bought this when his old style motorcycle battery died. This newer technology one has worked great. We were shipped the wrong one, but their customer service was great and they got the correct one right out to us.
B00GJMQEQC|5|Fits great, feels great. The lining zips in and out very easily, and even though it’s snug, I can still get a hoodie underneath for more warmth. Great jacket.
B008OIRXOG|3|These were not the easiest to install on my 2012 Dodge Durango. The passenger side fell off within a week even though I followed the installation instructions to the letter. Not sure what went wrong.u
B000J3ABQ6|5|Nice welding, good finish although the front and rear were from two different lots so one pair is powder coated and the other is a yellow zinc plating. Installed with Rancho U-Bolt Kit and BDS 2&#34; lift spring packs and everything fit perfectly.
B007V1R3H4|5|This is much less expensive than at the local parts store. It cured my car's poor performance problem. I recommend it.
B00EIIH6PC|4|I pretty much worked...I have a big star in my windshield on the passenger side...this didn't hide the star, but I think it filled it well enough to inhibit &#34;running&#34; of cracks, which is the main thing I was worried about.
B00LPSOAX4|5|A most versatile kit that comes in very handy in many situations! !!
B00I5058AY|5|Great product, a little extra work to fit onto vehicle but kept the good ride and gave it the level look I was after..
B000NSN7O0|3|came without any nuts and bolt so had to go and buy those
B005Y81OAS|1|I am very disappointed because the wrong ones were sent to me and when I called and spoke to the person, he was not willing to send me the right ones I had order in the first the place. I made sure I was ordering side steps for my 2014 Jeep wrangler 4 door, and 2 door side steps were sent to me.<br /><br />Very Very disappointed!!!!<br /><br />Kerri Willey
B002304O70|3|The sleeve is cheap and thats okay because its inexpensive. it gets the job done for my gsxr 03, but its not smooth like the OEM.
B001G4ZTVE|5|They worked great as expected.<br />Nice primer gun too
B00BLZ14ZS|5|high quality parts.
B000GTTWD6|5|Product was exactly as described....  2 years later and is still working perfectly!!  Would def. recommend this product to friends/family.
B00634MMMG|5|I purchased the Star Of David Decal in order to place it on the back window of my vehicle, and proclaim to the world my pride in being Jewish, my pride of Israel, and my intention to communicate my message to the world. The product arrived promptly and in perfect condition. It is exactly as described and the quality and size is impressive. I would definitely purchase more products from this seller.
B0049LVY9C|5|I bought this for our car since my husband is from Hawaii. He wasn't too crazy about the flowers but it is otherwise great. No complaints from me.
B000KIVPME|5|This is a top notch creeper, works great.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to work underneath their car.
B000CB7DWK|5|It is hard to rate a filter and even harder in the winter.  Let me say this: the filter media seems identical to the original, but this Mann filter has a cardboard frame, just as is shown in the Amazon product photo.  The original Mercedes filter has a plastic frame and a foam gasket.  So does the picture in the enclosed Mann installation instructions.  It is possible that the filter sold today by Mercedes at the dealership also has a paper frame.  This is my reason for 4 stars instead of five.  Time will tell if the cardboard flap seals on the Mann filter work well or not.  In any case, I am pleased right now.  I'll update this review if my opinion changes after pollen season this spring and summer.<br /><br />July 31, 2013<br />Update: 5 stars<br /><br />Pollen season has finally come and this filter has worked great.  I use air conditioning all the time due to allergies and the air is always clean in my car.  My dashboard is black and rarely needs to be cleaned.  This filter has performed exactly as designed.  Make sure you pay attention to the airflow arrow. It can go in right or wrong.  As luck will have it, I initially put it in wrong, but corrected it, as I did not notice the arrow at first.  I will order another at the end of the year.  This filter is easy to ignore, but it absolutely necessary to replace periodically.  My airflow improved dramatically after removing the previous filter.  I will not let that happen again.<br /><br />I recommend this without reservation to anyone requiring a cabin filter.  My experience with Mann filters over the last 25 years is consistent.  They are excellent in every application.
B00A8VFEN4|4|Good fit and comfortable but I still have to wear earplugs b/c when a bug hits it sound like a drum.
B00132A7DE|1|This Digital Dash Camera worked for a day then went haywire  on me. May be I got a bad one.
B000P4RZ0O|5|Very Good!!
B0026I5Z22|5|Ordered on Sunday December 7th, said it would be here between the 11th and 14th. It shipped on Monday the 8th and got here on Tuesday the 9th. I opened my well protected package to see my aerocatch hood pins. Everything looks great, everything was there and I will install tomorrow. I'm as happy as could be with my order. Unless I come back to complain about these once installed, I couldn't be happier.
B004B6D16Y|5|Good condition and it fits, but they don't like it when you wear it to the bank for some reason.
B004W6IU32|4|Pontiac Grand Prix Replacement Tail Lights Unit - 1-Pair<br />Looks good, easy to install, Bulb sockets fit no problem! fast delivery and the price was reasonable.
B007SXJIJ6|5|I have a Mercedes Benz 2009 C300 4Matic Sport (W204). Check Engine Light was reporting an error with Thermostat Sensor, and Oil Temperature was fluctuating up and down on the dash, or ready very low. Turned out to be a faulty sensor within the Thermostat, and purchased this item to replace it. The only difference between the MB Factory Thermostat and this one, is a Mercedes Emblem. Everything else is the exact same so it's essentially OEM.<br /><br />There are Video Tutorials online if you need help, One by FCP Euro I believe who also sells this Thermostat with Coolant. (Although Amazon is cheaper for the Thermostat alone). The only other part you will need is some Coolant, as you will lose a good amount when you remove the old one.<br /><br />Make sure you use the same Coolant that is already in your car to top it off, or do a full flush. If the Coolant is not pre-diluted, you'll need to do a 50/50 mix with Distilled Water.
B004U3THY8|4|Like the product but question the way they package and store the lugs. Yes, they are just lugs but they pack them in a plastic bag within a box altogether so they bang up against each other during shipment which causes chips and scratches in the paint. The main reason I knocked off one star was because several of the lugs had rust inside on the threads. I easily cleaned them with a wire brush but these are new and I should not need to do this.
B003LJKQ6U|5|Reliable cabin filter.
B000E8T80Q|5|In our household,<br /><br />we have 2009 Honda, 2002 Camry, 2011 Kia Optima.<br /><br />I use Purolator PureONE filter in all of them.<br /><br />These filter have great filtration rate, and after doing about 50+ oil change jobs by my self,  I do not use anything else.<br /><br />I often buy these in bulk and carry them in my car, just in case I need to do a oil change with local auto shops.
B00HHGSNTA|5|Fast, inexpensive and great quality
B001TXDNWE|5|Product was just as described, noticeable performance on my bike. Filter was in good condition with plenty of oil for initial use.
B000CAZ5ZI|4|very good
B002BSENFC|4|These are very thick and will provide great protection...but..don't expect them to go on without trapping water behind them initially.Due to the contour of the Dodge Ram headlights, it is impossible to get the bubbles out during the initial installation. Even using alcohol and water, as per the recommendations, it takes a few days in direct sunlight and patience to eventually get the trapped water to evaporate and to press the bubbles out. Overall great product, just be patient.
B002SP69G4|5|Seems very durable. I thought at first it did not fit on my 2010 Ford Escape because the original filter just fell in. A little force and it snapped right in. The fit seems like it should filter better also. This should be the last filter we buy.
B004OI3MNG|2|Gun is OK. It applied Al's liner but i found it was not easy to dial in the texture i was going for. It is harder than texturing sheet rock. Quality is good. Buy the LMR from Al's too, it works nice.
B003NS5NK8|1|With a 4.5 star rating with over 100 reviewers I thought I would give this a shot to restore a scratch I had on my Lexus.  Although I was a little hesitant when I saw the abrasive pad as part of the kit, however I followed the instructions to the &#34;T&#34;.  The result is, you guessed it:  the finish on my car is worse than what I started.  To be honest, the majority of the scratch came out.  However, the clear coat came off with it and attempts to restore it proved futile.  Look, I'm not an auto hobbiest and I don't doubt the veracity of the reviewers when they enthused over this product.  If you're constantlt working with filler and restoration products, you accumulate more expertise.  However, for the average Joe, I really think this product is not a good idea.  The problem comes at the scratch removal stage which is to know when to call it quits.  In my case, I used light to moderate pressure and did not exceed 10 second intervals (per the mfr's instructions). There are two problems:  the foam emitted from the pad obscures the level of abrasion.  Even constantly wiping it won't do.  Also, the mfr stating that &#34;dulling&#34; of the finish is no problem (it will be restored later) is misleading.  I wish anyone good luck using this product.
B0010GFW88|1|low quality
B001GJ3FIS|3|Since this did not cost much, I did not expect much.  The construction is decent, however, it is heavy and after holding it a while, my hand gets tired.
B00KNX3GW8|5|Great purchase.
B00EUZAF10|3|Not a big enough difference on my 14 Tundra to had been worth the money.. Install was very easy though.
B006R7PHI0|5|Item was as stated. Used it first weekend we received it. Worked very well easy to fold up and store as well as sweep off if sand or dirt gets on it.
B000BB84X8|5|If you've ever tried to clean the underside of a RV awning you'll find it better be summer and your in a bathing suit.  This product not only takes all the scrubbing out of the project but after you put it on you can back out rinse with a hose.<br /><br />This is truly a product that can save you a lot of work.
B000UNLVDM|5|I am from the south & have never seen snow chains before. I was going on a snowboard trip in NC & didn't want to get stuck on the top of the mountain if a blizzard hit right before I checked out. I ordered these for my Acura TL & practiced putting them on in the yard. Granted, there was no ice/snow & it was warm, but my first try I had them on both tires in 10-15 min, & that is with watching a install video online because the instructions that come with it leave something to be desired. It took less than 5 min to take them off. I tried it a second time & had both chains on in 5 min & off in 2 min. Very fast & easy, I can't speak for the durability since I haven't had to use them but the design is simple!!
B00DYSMTV8|5|Very good !! Winderfoul
B002BS40X2|5|I liked this vest but my son did not. The quality was great for the price. Would purchase from you again,
B002UC8OCC|5|Had to replace our hot water door and frame.  Lost the door in a big wind storm while driving through Texas.  The frame and door fit perfectly on to our 12 gallon Suburban RV tank.  The 10 & 12 gallon are the same.
B0071DN41G|5|Bought these last winter and it has been about 6 months. They were pretty easy to put on, a little tight when you roll up the window on them and they look really sharp. Known company and great product.
B000C5A1DE|5|Works well in my Honda accord.
B000BGM51A|4|Installed just the leg part on my camper to replace a lost part.
B0045T4PP8|1|Not what I thought I was buying. I thought these were the eyelashes that stick out. They are decals. I will read the fine print next time I order, decals is not what I expected.
B00CS9CO6Y|5|Used this for a beach trip. plenty of room in it. we have racks on our vehicle so the straps ran front to back. Stayed tight and everything stayed dry..
B005VDXTZ4|5|The belt looks great and functions perfectly. I would recommend this belt for anyone wanting something other than a plain belt.
B008MRHDT4|5|esta muy bueno el producto me gusto y a mi primo tambien que es a quien regale esta muy contento
B0091YV1F4|5|This things are nice and bright, they went right in the stock spot with no modifications and no problems. Thanks
B0027UMVQC|5|Same as with the winch mount.  Works great on my used Polaris.  the rollers help keep the line on the winch from being tangled.
B00TACQD0U|5|Fit as should
B000JD39WO|5|quick and easy to apply. fit perfect with 08 civic sedan
B00E92ZQIQ|5|Wery nice
B0073W8F0K|5|bought this in December and one of the ballast just went down deb d d d d d d a
B000EVYI6W|5|Great
B004AGIY5I|5|Using on 92 sportster looks great!
B0009IQXFO|5|If I could bathe in this stuff, I probably would. I've used dozens of car shampoos over the last 20 years or so, and this Meguiar's Gold Class is definitely the best. It doesn't take much to get a nice cleansing foam going, and once you do, it applies and washes with an ultimate smoothness that I haven't been able to find with other soaps. And not that it matters, but it's also got a really great scent, which is a nice little bonus when you'd rather be doing other things besides washing your car.
B00I3AOZRS|4|The product worked perfectly. They are bright enough to do what they are supposed to do. Quality is not the best BUT, BUT, they do work.
B003LSJJJ6|2|Used mine for the first time yesterday and couldn't wait to get home and send them back.  They fog as soon as you stop as the foam doesn't allow for the best circulation.  They are VERY uncomfortable to wear, if you are wearing a 1/2 helmet.  The foam/glue shows very poor craftsmanship.  Yesterday was very sunny and it was very hard to be looking in the direction of the sun, despite the lenses actually turning black from clear.<br /><br />I would look elsewhere.
B000RH20N6|1|Wont go on with the luggage rack. Because everything is at an angle, it offsets the holes. Hard to explain but they don't work.
B009DIWO2M|5|This air filter is a great replacement and half the price of K&N filters. I didn't get any crazy power adding results but it fit without any issues and works as it should. If you want crazy power adding results put an LS1 in your XJ!
B0013CRFA2|1|Unfortunately, gotta one-star this one. These arrived with an auxiliary cable glued on that I had zero use for. It was sealed to the bulb's wires by a four wire cable attacher that was affixed at the factory. It took two people to hold it carefully and cut off the unnecessary cable.<br /><br />Then I put the bulb in my Saturn Sky, that someone else had deployed an H11 HID kit. I could not close the headlight port cover, because the bulb's lead wires stick out too far. But wait, that's not the worst - it has some terrible flickering issue. I thought it was my ballast, but I swapped them and the problem persisted.<br /><br />Needless to say, these are getting taken out as soon as a new set arrives. I wouldn't trust them for a single road trip.
B004TH9Z4M|5|This is great compare to other wood handle. It is cheap and does its job.
B00282YGGM|5|These blades are less expensive than what is available in the local auto parts stores and work quite well.  I was having trouble finding the correct size locally without special order.  As always, Amazon came through with flying colors.
B005CEHTEY|5|Worked fine, 3M always good
B001NPMX7Y|5|So far, these are working great on my 98' Volvo S70. No flicker. No unwanted dash lights lighting-up. We had to hit the hardware store to find a piece of metal that we had to bend and fashion into a mounting bracket. But this has completely transformed the amount of light available now on the road. For only $50!!
B00MJ43ZQG|1|Does not fit Mazda 3 sedan... Too long on front windows.
B00HNW9C52|5|Fits vey nice
B003UQBE38|4|Just the thing for the Boatswain's Mate on the go. This decal is on the side of one of my Gorilla Boxes which has gone from Kuwait to Colorado, then back to Abu Dhabi. It's still there even after US Customs slapped a sticker on it that I had to peel off.<br /><br />Note: When they say 6 inches, they mean it. This is a pretty big sticker.
B000UK2IXW|5|this product met my satisfactions and was sipped promptly. no damage and good price. I would recommend. it.<br /><br />Works wellt.
B00527SLLQ|5|I bought this battery about four months ago after looking at several.  I was, as you may be, leary of the low price, but because of other good reviews, gave it a shot.  It went in easily and is still working great.  I assume by now it would have faild if it was going to.  One little wrinkle.  I had to buy smaller bolts and nuts to attach the cables as the ones for the old battery didn't quite fit.(less than a buck at the auto parts store)
B00B5KXKYW|5|Very good product. It's fit perfect with my agv rp60.
B003NDKB8M|5|Received the KN air filters and they were exactly what was needed for our Infiniti M-37...did not realize they shipped two to a box, so returned two back to Amazon with no hassle, ease of return, and Amazon credited my account in a very timely fashion. Bottomline, great product was shipped on time, and no issues with the partial return - Amazon is a brilliant marketplace!
B00D2HTIIS|1|It was broken with in a few weeks of purchasing it. :(<br />Really nice while it lasted
B00E1SQ9RU|2|The price is the only good part. These rotors rust extremely fast. My front rotors look like they are 10 years old whereas my back ones that are original BMW look like new even though i haven't changed them out.
B003MANZ7A|4|Great product and quality but does not come with Bolts to mount it
B00UHZYTJ6|5|I'm sure everyone's worst nightmare is getting suck in the middle of nowhere when your car or truck's battery quits. Sure, if a nice stranger is around, he/she might be able to give your vehicle a jump start, but there might be a time when nobody is there to help you. If this situation ever does occur, it would great to have a car jump starter kit on hand.<br /><br />I've seen these type of kits online, but the Volitigers Car Jump Starter Kit is the first that I've ever tried. I received a complimentary kit yesterday in exchange of my honest thoughts. The kit features a battery charger, jump starter cables, home adapter, car adapter, USB cables and a storage case. There is a multipurpose pocket knife as an added bonus. It takes between 6-8 hours to charge the battery. It has a LED light with three different modes: flashlight, strobe light and a SOS light. There are two USB ports on the battery charger.<br /><br />The battery may look small, but it has a lot power. After the battery was full charged, I tested it out and it seems to work pretty good. It would me a great gift for Father's Day this year.
B005NLQAHS|4|This unit works very well but the software interface is frustrating. You have to just look until you find an app that agrees with you. Otherwise this work wonderfully. I found that for people who say they have trouble connecting, if you'll just start your Bluetooth, launch the app, the unit will connect automatically. I never had any issues.
B00B3P26N0|5|Great sticker, fast shipping, and a great price.
B00EC2CA0K|5|Very Strong, No Problems. More HD then expected.
B00N09INMK|5|Wow what a great replica of awesome giant forest machine, it was on time very happy with you customer service is top self , thnx and I will be a very satisfied returning customer
B00ODR69QK|5|This is how the brake lights work on transit busses; when you back off the throttle the retarder kicks in so the brake lights come on. Yes I know how stupid it is but people actually tailgate 40-60 thousand pound vehicles even though hitting one is like running into a concrete wall. I'm going to put these on my car and pick-up.
B0085XKIW4|1|Did not fit bike as listed.
B000C15CRS|4|Replaced my fox mustang balancer like a champ, great price.
B000WKICWQ|5|I wish it were not so pricey compared to other brands.
B00BMWQ7RU|2|The first unit I bought the pins broke and I couldn't use it and had to return it. The next unit I got went through the programming ok, however it still didn't work when I went to start the car
B0033YHLFM|5|Put it in my 2005 f150 supercrew front passenger door. Works fine a little slower than the drivers door but still strong. I installed this thing in about an hour and half, very easy fix. Dealership wanted like 300 bucks to fix this, yeah right. For some reason they taped the switch wiring against the drive motor, makes the wire very tight when plugged in so i cut the tape to give the wiring some slack. Makes more sense to me to not have wiring on the motor any ways.
B0084ZKVAM|5|As described.
B00G3BRNVY|5|I get better gas mileage out of this oil, and the interior of the engine seems cleaner after using this (I've had to change the valve cover gaskets twice and there was a notable difference)
B003NS5NK8|5|Worked great.
B00CMF6OR4|5|Very well built, sun visor are amazing, but air intake could be better, on a hot summer (like in south America) you will think twice on this for a ride!  I don't know if this special design for naked bikes really makes difference on speeds above 160 KM/h 100 mph.
B000LY0U82|5|awesome fit for ls swap!!!! Hooker products are always top notch. I will be a customer for life. 1979 c10
B008BL0C76|5|I bought this to replace my standard 2006 SR5 roof rack because I like the styling of this one better.  This is the one made for the Urban Runner so it is black instead of the silver/gray on the sport editions.  Installed very easily and have no problems whatsoever.
B004AQR53K|5|Product works as stated. It is constantly reading power. It has shut down power to rv twice, so apparently doing its job. Glad I purchased!
B0015PTTZ6|5|I love 'em - I bit too bright, if you can call that a fault, I feel badly for the folks behind me in night traffic stop lights.... I can see my turn signals illuminating street signs 1/4 mile away!<br /><br />They look great and the wrap-around lenses for the backup lights light up the sides which the OEM never did.
B000FGCYZ8|5|I am very pleased with K&N products.  I don't know if it added any horsepower but it runs fine.  No issues with it.
B000E24352|2|Not Stainless steel as advertised.
B000BZX92K|4|Excellent product thank you for your work.
B005WXNG06|2|It fits my little Yamaha Ovation, which is only 94 inches long, but will not fit my 380 Skidoo which is 100 inches from nose to tail, and even has the short windshield. The product description says it will fit sleds up to 115 inches; don't believe it.
B0067UAWSM|5|Seems to do the Job!
B001KP20C0|1|Horrible not a woman's  size more of a kids size<br />Vest looks like it s made for a child<br />I would not recommend it to anyone
B0046I3I8I|1|These are very small not happy
B00433SIQI|5|Great!
B00ELASYIA|5|Great set of cables!
B0092QQDDQ|5|This will be the perfect gift for my butthead brother. It looks very official; when you see it on a vehicle you first think the owner must be a state employee of some kind, and that's perfect.
B006TAF7DU|5|I gave it to my dad for father's day and he loves it!
B002FBNL44|4|WORKS  GREAT
B00ESLBSJY|5|Amazing
B00AJUDY54|5|These mats are great. Good quality, not made cheap. They look nice in the vehicle and of course, suit their purpose.
B005RA706A|5|These are a perfect fit for the Vision.<br />No smell as others have reported. I'm not sure I would be able to fully pack them and then put them into the saddle bags, but that is more a function of the design of the Visions saddle bags than these inserts.<br />Would definitely buy again.
B00KLSZ632|5|These bulbs are nothing short of Awesome. Put them in my 2000 F250 SUPERDUTY and they look great. I love the switchback part of the bulb.
B000KYWT96|5|pleasure doing business, I give 5 stars. I will buy stuff from this person again .<br />everything is perfect, I'm happy you're happy so it's all good
B00PXO85DW|1|Straps broke the first time I tried to remove it from my F150.
B000FG4IGG|4|I really likd it  but the word cure should be on the other side of the ribbon so the words cystic fibrosis can be seen more prominate.
B0006Q7H36|5|I use it on my bolt action rifles. Much better in my opinion than a spray or drop lubricant.
B000679GJI|5|I think the reason for mixed reviews is because it works well on flat surface areas like the arm or back of the sofa but maybe not as well on cushions. I had several spots where the plastic like surface had been scratched off by my cat clawing it when he jumped up. I peeled all the loose pieces off and filled it in with this and it looks like new again! If you look close this product is not quite as shiny as the other area but I was able to mix black and brown to color match it perfect! This product dries just like the plastic like covering that was on top of the leather before my cat scratched it up!
B000E7WLJW|5|The bag is made of durable plastic and it fit perfectly over out hitch carrier.  I liked that is flexible and the size allowed us to fit a lot of luggage.  We drove through rain,  dusty/windy areas and everything inside was protected.  Also,  the height of the bag was just right and did not block my vehicle's brake lights.  We purchased a bungee net to go over it, and keep it extra secure on the carrier.  The bag does come with straps though and they seemed to do the job just fine.
B000CJ05ZE|5|This Item is great for changing options on your alarm. Works Perfectly. Would purchase again if needed to.
B003UT3S6Q|5|I'm skeptical of no scrub wheel cleaners, but this one seriously works by just spraying on and hosing off. I have a Ford Focus ST, which makes some serious brake dust; Sonax cuts right through it no problem. I am surprised by how well it works. People aren't joking... it has a unique odor.
B0001EX1W4|3|Model number was for in channel install.  When recieved it was for outsde window frame.  Sent back.Ventshade needs to update Application site.  Have used their products before,and  was satisfied.
B0048EE1TK|5|These do the job for a great price.  The fit was great and so far quite durable.  Love them.
B004KGCN8W|5|I received this and could not wait to put it on my car.  It is a great tribute to make for a lost pet.  I got many compliments on it and people wanting to know where I got it.
B00C5SYH68|5|Good quality American made oil filter. The XP means that this filter is made with filtering material that works well with synthetic oils. It also has a bypass valve.
B00264RXWQ|5|It works great and looks good!<br />When I installed it I replaced the clutch cable too, took about 10 min to install both.
B001C6L5DM|4|Works great and fits perfect on my 03 Mazda 6s!!
B001OMVCIC|5|Great product I tow a 29' travel trailer and it hold it level with 30 psi
B0009JKI8G|1|I purchased this item in May and it didn't get much use over the summer due to the lack of rain.  However, as it has been raining more recently, this blade has been showing how bad it is.  It streaks horribly no matter how much I clean it.  At the same time I installed this blade on the driver's side of my car, I installed a basic blade on the passenger's side.  The passenger blade works just fine.  Save yourself money and just buy Anco blades since they are cheaper and work better anyway.
B00062YEJU|5|I have an old truck with a turbocharged, stroked small block Ford. I have a big cam in it and only make 4-5 inches of vaccum at idle instead of the normal 15-20 inches of vacuum, this made the brake pedel very hard to push and the truck didn't feel safe during hard braking. A friend suggested I add a vacuum canister as I had been considering switching to hydraulic assisted power brakes but that is over $1,000 in parts. I could have added a vacuum pump but that was $350. I tried adding this can first as it was the cheapist option. with a minimum amout of work I had this mounted and plumbed in my truck and it has worked great, my pedel is much easier to push and the brakes feel normal again.
B001O1O9YW|5|Less than half of what the dealer wanted for these mats.  These are manufacturer original - not knock offs. Perfect fit.
B000E9Z49Y|5|multiple purchases a month, smells way better than the others and does a great job cleaning as well.
B001LHVOVK|5|It reads my 1999 Honda Accord error code with no problem. But you have to fix the error before clearing the check engine light using this tool, otherwise the engine light still come back on.<br />Works as described and worth the price.
B00737GY3U|1|I would call this a very low quality product, don't buy it.  The wire gauge is dramatically lighter than all the previous 4 pin connectors I have installed on both boat and utility trailers.  JUNK
B001INL9JE|5|Rain or shine this thing seriously stays on my car, I have never had a decal sticker last this long and still look this good. Love it!
B001EOYIKE|4|It's a trailer hitch and it does what it's supposed to do. I would say that this is the most important thing about it. Luckily I also found it incredibly easy to install. I didn't need to put my CR-V on ramps to install it and it only took about 10 minutes.
B0002SRH60|5|Removed hub almost effortlessly when two other brands would not budge. I used it to pull a front  hub on my 1993 Chevrolet c1500 pickup.
B0031HEIDY|1|The bulbs may be okay, but I'm unsatisfied because I can't use them (returning them).<br /><br />Amazon lists this headlight bulb as a replacement for a 2010 VW Jetta but that is INCORRECT.<br />The correct bulbs are &#34;H7&#34; bulbs and Amazon says Sylvania H7 &#34;does not fit&#34;...  That's wrong again!<br /><br />So buyer double-check first, then you won't have to do a return etc....
B00SNRXHDO|1|I got the helmet in a timely manner, however it was not what I expected so I sent it back. I ended up paying for shipping both ways... Not worth it....
B00141Q42C|5|I have been using these Bosch blades on an '05 Volvo V50 ever since I bought it, change them about every year.
B009IFIMD0|5|no problems.  fit fine.  looks normal.
B0029TQDLA|5|they do the job....have bought quite a few of these from various places.  too bad they don't sell them in stores.
B001O0A1X6|1|I love the way this top looks when it is fully on but, it is a pain to take off I can remove my hard top in less time. the rear window has no way to hold it up when you roll it up, you have to completely remove it, and then, to replace it you have to basically remove the whole top. To reattach the header bar you also have to remove the whole top and then reinstall the top from the front to back and if it is not 75-80 degrees forget getting it back on. I had high hopes for this top but not anymore.
B000R8F47Y|5|I have used this for any variety of load sizes in the bed of my truck and its a great safety measure to take when securing different load sizes.  Very strong and strechy rope!
B006B80FL4|4|This filter looks better than the stock one and installs in minutes. It is the \\"dry\\" filter so you don't have to worry about the air sensor getting oil on it. Air flow is a bit higher than stock, but not by much. It lacks the wire mesh air diffuser like the stock filter, however I've not noticed any issue.
B001G4Z5J0|4|I've used this carrier a few times now.  It definitely added noticeably to the comfort level and whine reduction from the back seats of our SUV.  Used it on some long trips we took last summer and to transport tools for a renovation project.<br /><br />Basically, does the job ... I recommend getting a roll or two of reflector tape to increase the carrier's visibility at night.
B005NLQAHS|5|This works just great with the Android Torque App. I highly recommend it.
B00E4QWW84|5|Love these little toppers, right from the park.
B00877SL2M|5|Their bright and work great. I only had 1 go bad after 2 years of use.
B00LCIHT1C|5|fing awesome
B001BK7SAS|5|I bought this instead on spending $150 at a Chevy dealer, I installed this in 20 minutes and it works great!
B00CTAPGX0|5|Very nice looking...
B000CFQB8S|3|Shipping was great, but when I received the package, I noticed that the box was wet. I opened it to the bottle leaking. I had 3/4 of the cleaner product left, and had to replace the bottle. Hopefully yours doesn't get messed up :)
B000C2M8CO|1|This was the wrong part and was nothing like the picture...the wrong part number was on the package.  Need to redo their catalogue
B00763KCM0|5|Good customer !!! Good item
B00G4L23PY|5|Just ordered my second set of these great bulbs.  I bought the original set in June of 2013 and had my first one burn out 16 months later in October of 2014.  As far as these higher power lights go that is pretty good life.  I had the Sylvania silverstars in a previous vehicle and I don't they they lasted even a year..  I think that is weird since as far as I know Osram and Sylvania are the same company.  These are made in Germany and they are of good quality... nice bright white light without much of the blue look.  If you can find them at a decent price... I think these were around $30 delivered from Amazon,  they are well worth it.
B000CMKEKC|5|The floormats fit perfectly in my 1995 Ford Ranger XLT pickup.  Super-super heavy duty and easy to just hose clean.
B003177EZI|5|best farkel added to my bike helps you attain good riding posture
B001W6LGGS|3|First I want to say I am waiting on a replacement, which was easy no questions asked. It was simple to install, but once hooked up I have terrible reception  (signal from transmitter ) it is a long truck Dodge ram 1500 quadcab. But I ran the transmitter halfway up the bed . So it's 6 feet away at most. So I'm hoping with the replacement transmitter all will be great and I will update this review.  If I end up with the same problem I will probably just ask for refund.<br /><br />Update: the second camera worked the same way. I ended up keeping it because inbetween the glitchs I could make out if I was about to hit something. I would not recommend this product.
B001FAGKBC|5|I am a 52 year old grandma and put these on by myself!  Taa-daa1  ;)  Good quality, and they look great.  Very pleased with product.
B001AWLTX4|5|This is exactly what it states a lightweight skull face mask.  My son used it for a haunted hayride where he scares people and it worked great.  The seller stated everything correctly and shipped immediately
B009S31VVW|5|Fit perfectly. Great transaction!
B0041MGA52|1|Only lasted 4 months and I was replacing again went to autozone this time will never skimp on quality
B000CFS028|4|Installed on a 2008 Toyota Sienna and when packing heavy for camping and pulling the boat with our family of 4 I noticed a improved handling, headlights were aimed correctly at night and ride quality was a bit stiffer but still good quality ride.<br /><br />Biggest test was camping with a rack out the back with some heavy items I can't put in the van as rear sway changing lanes was of concern.  Still have to remember that sway weight is behind the back wheel but changing lanes was no problem and vehicle handled great.<br /><br />I have on order a 18' 9\\" boat which loaded with trailer should weight in close to if not over 3,000 lbs.  It does have trailer brakes (Anything near 2,500 I would recommend having brakes on a trailer with this van).  Max capacity is 3500 boats are tongue light and 266 hp should be plenty with no mountains to climb.  Most drives to launch are under 5 miles, but a few trips of a hour and a few a 3 hrs.  Currently pull a slight shorter boat with no problems, however didn't really need air bags unless fully loaded up for a week trip with the boat.<br /><br />Easy to install and good idea even if you only load up a few times a year.  Keep some pressure in the system even over winter to avoid pinching the bags.
B007Z75632|5|Best bang for the buck.
B000EBMLIY|5|My husband and I recently purchased a '06 Jeep Wrangler with broken door straps. These were around $4 for a pair (yes, you get two when you place one order) and easily adjustable. Took all of five minutes to install, and it only took that long because I encountered a stripped screw. The strap's fabric is folded over and sewn in even sections to create slots. These slots are how the strap adjusts in length. Simply slide the strap up off the factory-installed hook and slide it back on in a different slot to make your door swing wider or tighter. They do what they're designed to do and have held up well during the month we have had them. They seem sturdy enough. Can't beat the price + quality.
B001QVZ52K|5|A well made product at a reasonable price.  I used this to replace a solid steel line on a 62 Thunderbird.  Helps to eliminate vapor lock and allows flexible routing.  Not for a concours restoration but certainly is technical improvement over the stock line.
B000E4RYLA|5|Fit the car so it did the job I needed it to do.  It works well on the car door.
B001F8O4US|5|These liners arrived quickly and fit my 2015 Dodge Journey perfectly. I would highly recommend them if you live in an area that gets a lot of snow and rainfall.
B00068XCQU|4|it charges more slowly than my old charger.<br />It doesn't have a meter showing how fast it's charging.<br />I like that it keeps the battery charged without over charging.
B00PT18QAQ|5|This is my first tire pressure gauge! It's very simple to use! Would recommend to everyone.
B0049U16XW|5|good
B004W7KS2C|5|Fits just as it should. Installation took around 20min while taking my time.
B001EOWQ5I|5|Very simple to install. Almost fool proof. No cutting, No splicing, plug n play. Removing the trim panel was a little tricky but install was still less than 30 minutes.
B004W7R7XU|4|looks good,very easy to install. seems more of a shield against pebbles than it will be for bugs. I'll find out when I take a long road trip.
B008BE02D2|4|Not as bright as white, still have a slight yellowish look to them but much brighter then other cheaper bulbs.
B0016KAAIA|5|I got this hitch just to install it on the car for emergency's, and it fit great.  Here in ND, it snows and if i get stuck, now i have a place to tie a tow strap to get out of a snow bank.  thanks, easy to install, I just modified one heat shield a little to make this fit perfect.  thanks.
B000N4UQL6|4|I recieved this unit and it was packed well.  i researched around the web for a good reviewed and easy to use battery backup that would be simple enough for my wife to use and not be intimidated by it.<br />i charged the unit up as instructed for 36hrs.  I tested the unit out a few times and was pleasantly happy with it.  i had not chosen wrong.  the cables are long enough that i could place the unit on the ground and easily hook up to my Plymouth Grand Voyager.  I also tested it on my HHR and it worked beautifully. I no longer have my 4x4 truck, but I don't think the leads would have reached with that one.  I had the unit in my van for a backup for my wife for over a month.  it recommends that you rcharge it every few month or so.  Recently, I pulled it out of the van during a storm where we lost power to the house, so that I could use the 12v lighter outlet to charge my cellphone.  I checked the power on the unit and it was still at 100%.  This is after 3 training scenario tests I did myself and with my wife without a recharge a month earlier.  I was pleasantly surprised with how it held the charge so well.  However, the reason for the 4 star was for the quality.  The 12 volt outlet didn't work.  The next day, I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a prepaid shipping label.  I shipped the unit back and received a replacement a few weeks later.<br /><br />Overall, this was a fabulous choice.  it is not a light unit.  It holds charge very well.  It has a simple on/off knob.  if the leads are hooked up backwards it will even tell you!  It is a no brainer.  You can check the internal batteries charge simply by a push of a button.
B000C57K9M|4|These struts added the good handling that had disappeared from my 04 Impala. It took about 3 hours for me to put them both in alone. I had never done a replacement like this before but it was straightforward. Between the YouTube videos and the instructions in the box, it was pretty simple to do myself but you HAVE to have the right tools like a sledgehammer, wrenches, and the sockets. If you don't have a sledge hammer for this, BUY ONE.<br />The struts are great and I like them for sure.
B003G1C7V0|3|Installed On my 98 accord good fit
B000VSY4HG|1|Does not fit my 2015 F350.  The receiver lock is not long enough to go through and lock.  It is over an inch short, my truck does have a 2 1/2&#34; receiver with an insert which is why it;s not long enough.  Quality looks OK.
B004QJLE9C|5|Great product, very happy.
B003IOITIK|5|it dos what its made for ... i wish the cable was just a bit longer ... other then that its good
B00SHZJX7G|5|They arrived within the specified timeframe. They were easy to install on a 93 Volvo 940. Far cheaper than Volvo brand replacements. Couldn't be happier with them. I will amend my review whenever I know how long they last but so far so good.
B000IBELD8|5|I mean, it's a light bulb... it flashes when I turn on the signal on my bike. It's bright. Makes turning a whole lot easier.
B001GF2T3E|5|This is a great sunshade!  It fits perfectly and is very sturdy.  I was worried about spending this amount on a sunshade but once I received it and used it, I felt it was worth the price.
B00WGUJ3AA|1|Not too happy.
B0002KKIUK|4|Easy to use once all is masked off.  Three coats over a days time.  First rain and didn't see the beading that I expected to see?
B00IKSN34E|4|Easy to install, right to the point
B007WWM16K|5|My original Evo mats started disintegrating, so I had to buy a replacement. These look exactly the same as the original ones, and appear to be OEM ones - so I am quite happy.<br /><br />UPD1: I've bought it for ~$69. If you are paying more, you might reconsider;<br />UPD2: Driver-side mat has now developed a rip on the right side, close to the middle (for no apparent reason, I do not place my foot there. Not seller's fault, but FYI).
B000GTZNYI|5|I love motion pro tools.  The best for motorcycles.  I have most everything they offer for motorcycles.  Very durable.  A company that makes tools for the working class rider.
B00GWEQ732|5|I attached this to my office chair and it supports my neck perfectly.
B000XY6Z66|5|Fits great for my trip. QUALITY shows--well made to last. Made travel so easy. Hard to locate this locally. So glad a quality company had this item and shipped on time.
B000WJCXNG|2|THIS HOSE DID NOT HAVE THE CORRECT CONECTIONS ON THE ONE END. IT WOULD NOT BOLT UP TO THE ONE END, SO I RETURNED IT.
B00PEAU0L0|4|Nice oitput. Od say more pirple than blue.
B00AYA3Q0M|4|Perfect fit for my 2005 Toyota Tacoma.  It is plastic in nature.  I wish it had been more of a rubber quality.
B001TJ7CRK|1|this is no good it go on but has soon as it gets wet it come right off.This was not worth the money
B00HVGRR0W|5|Works perfect
B0019470XQ|5|Replaced the old lights on my Pop-Up. They work & look great!
B00138FAMQ|4|The frame and clear license plate covers were easy to install and only the top two fasteners had to be used.  The covers were great since they covered both the top (fasteners) as well as the bottom where no fasteners were used.  The only downside was corrosion of the metal frame due to salt and other chemicals used to deice the highways. I would suggest that a heavy coat of wax or a clear spray be used to protect the metal from corrosion.  They are a very nice addition.
B001EP27YC|2|Would not fit 2004 Volvo XC70. On the right side had to use sledge hammer to widen the mount. On left side had to use tool to widen both holes because holes were not aligned. Did not have to modify rear bumper.
B00HLUJX6Y|3|For my 95 Honda accord wagon I had to order a trans cooler, the OEM fan would not fit, the drain plug & one lower fan stand off hits the cross member.<br /><br />Since the A/c fan fits fine I replaced the rad fan with second A/c fan.<br />I raised the radiator 1/4 of an inch cut the one fan stand off & replaced the drain plug with a flush plug.<br />I also had to modify the top hold downs.<br /><br />It seams to be keeping the car cool & I'm hopping the larger trans cooler will help my trany.
B00U87J5AQ|4|I had an issue with the lacking of a gasket -- I contacted the seller, and they did not know how to resolve the issue, but they tried to help, and were very courteous and prompt to answer my emails -- but, upon doing some web-based research, I realized that the manifold and test pipe were mocked-up from a 95-99 Plymouth Breeze (same as a Neon, but with a different collector flange setup). Once I figured this out, I locally sourced the needed components: collector donut (Walker # 31531), and a bolt and spring kit (Walker # 35031), the combo costing about $30. As well as, the #3 cylinder pipe is too close to its lower bolt hole, which means: you'll need an Allen head bolt, and that bolt will have to be threaded in first, and you'll have to walk the manifold to the cylinder head with that bolt (this makes for a slow install, but it'll work). Other than those issues, the header and test pipe are a great deal! It's a short-runner header, so the noticeable power gain is mostly in the top end of the power band, but it's there! I coupled the exhaust with their Short Ram Induction kit, a new intermediate pipe, and an OE muffler (all sourced from Amazon), which keeps it quiet, until I go wide open throttle! Plus, I wrapped the header, and test pipe, with header wrap, which dropped the under-hood temp. a bit, and there's a noticeable reduction in heat from the cabin floor. All-in-all, for less than $300, I completely replaced my exhaust system from the cylinder head back, and it sounds, and runs, great!
B002QEFORC|5|EASY REPLACEMENT
B0002KR88A|5|Works as advertised...
B006C1OFWU|4|worked just great  easy to program  but lettering stared to wear off after just a couple of days  and now completely gone
B0087LSQYG|5|Installed these in the dome lights of my 2010 Mazda 3s hatchback, great improvement over stock. Its a hit and miss with led but these bulbs worked for me, so I will be ordering another set tonight for the rest of the car. Shipping was also fast as well, ordered these the same time as I ordered an item shipping from New Jersey (I'm in Maryland) and I got the led first from California.
B00FSIN0U6|1|both light bulbs started out very good. After 2 months one of the bulbs started to flicker. Also very hot to the touch. not a very good life span for LED. I think it should last a lot longer.<br />Well, at the three month mark, both bulbs are not working. Amazon shows that it's too late for a replacement.
B005446EVQ|5|Great product gets job done and the whole kit is great everything you need for maintaining leather products
B001S2ZITM|5|The old one rusted through. I ordered this one and had it installed in less than an hour by myself in my driveway on a 2001 GMC C6500 Topkick. It required only basic mechanics tools and was not difficult at all and my fuel gauge works perfect.
B00D42AFS8|5|works great
B002P2TWBE|5|I use these on each corner to level out my food trailer. Hold the 6,000 lbs perfectly.
B00HUMSYIG|5|GREAT PRICE GREAT SHIPPING EXTREMLY BRIGHT
B00LIAOUU2|5|Muy gooodddd
B005NDQC3S|5|Top notch people, took very good care of me.  Its service over price that commands my decisions to repeat business.  And I will return.  Thank you so much for the help in these tight times.
B002H8YSYW|5|Exactly what I was looking for, good quality.
B0006IX7W4|5|great product,fantastic price,easy to install,time saver on set up,looks like they will last a very long time,we are truly satisfied
B004RBVM0U|5|Product as described.
B005BWGRF4|5|It showed up on time, is reasonable, and it fits the passenger side as specified.
B002MBUBTA|4|I used these in a stereo installation, and they are a great way to distribute power or ground to several sources.   I used them to distribute switched power for cooling fans and accessory lighting.
B00MOR4CFG|5|These look great in my 2005 Lexus ES 330. This Lexus is the first year for the ES to have factory projector headlamps. Projector Halogen is standard and HID was an option. Mine had halogen. These LED headlights are simple to install and look like the HIDs. My Lexus repairman is considering selling these as an alternative to costly factory HID repairs.
B000NRW67K|1|I have ordered two of these from Amazon and neither one fit!Even though the web-site description both times specified it would fit.The problem is some cars have the finger opening on the lid and some don't.The description both times specified,for lid with finger opening only but when I got the item it will not fit because it is for the fuel door without the finger opening!
B003SZWRZ0|2|Didn't fit on my 2014 JKU but installed it anyway. I wasn't able to use lower fasteners so I only used upper ones. It still looks good but not exactly what I expected. The materials and finish are good but it is formed wrong. Too expensive for the quality.
B001SZNDC8|1|I were disappointing this refillable A/C Dye Injector is not working  please take my world you will waste your money.  I learned from mistake
B004GFTC0E|3|The kit worked perfectly as expected for my Lexus fog lights, but nearly ruined my actual headlights due to horrible leftover spirals and haziness!  To finally fix it I ended up having to wet sand again at 2000 grit by hand then, then ran the 3000 grit drill pad, and lastly I applied Meguiars Plastx at a really high speed to remove the haze that was left over.  I ended up not even using the 3M rubbing compound.
B009DJV8PU|5|Great item, fast shipping and good price
B00FJXKE5E|4|The device itself is a 5, but the I cannot give it a 5 yet as the app for Android, an obviously necessary part of the duo, does not have all the features the iOS app does yet.<br /><br />Fantastic little thing, though; especially when paired with IFTTT.com
B00867HUMK|5|Made these into magnets for toolboxes. Love them.
B00KTIYXLU|5|ships really fast and very easy to program the dealer wanted $179  and these we're under $10 and they work GREAT with excellent range. Thanks a lot
B0036UPUVU|1|The picture of an aluminum cup is very misleading. If I had realized that I was buying a plastic cup with a screw on lid I would not have bought this.
B009F4JHHO|1|I've tried to get this to send to my phone, but can't get it to work. Also the cover for the circuit board came off the first or second time I disconnected it. I would give it 5 stars if it just worked!
B007RW2WUU|4|So, here is the deal...it fits, but it takes a bit of work to get it to fit.    The rubber seal that goes around the edge of the new filter is slightly thicker that the one you have now (because the one you have now fits). The clips that hold the air collector down onto the air filter won't reach because the new filter's gasket makes it sit too high, only an 1/8 of an inch but enough to make you a little frustrated because it simply wont snap into place.    So you have a few choices, you can remove the gasket altogether but that would not be recommended since it needs a tight seal.    Option two, remove the rubber seal from the old filter and put it on the new air filter. It is easy, it takes just a minute or so and then the filter will fit like it supposed to.    Once you do that, bingo, it snaps right into place.
B0002ZVMQO|3|Good price
B000GTXZC0|2|The Yuasa website touts, '..continuous research and development, along with unwavering standards of manufacturing quality have made us the largest American manufacturer and the largest distributor of batteries for powersports vehicles of all types.  That does NOT say their batteries are necessarily made in the USA, of course..just that they are the 'largest American manufacturer'.  I've been told by a battery store clerk that Yuasa is NOT the battery it once was since manufacture was moved to China.  Of course, that battery store could not GET me a Yuasa, which is what I was looking for.  Some folks don't view Taiwan (listed as the origin of this battery) as China and I do understand that point of view.  Neither do I think that 'Made in the U.S.A' necessarily makes it 'better'.  Certainly this battery is NOT made in the USA.  I bought THIS Yuasa because the brand has performed exceptionally for me in the past; EIGHT years of service on the last one I had!  Other batteries?  Not so well.  An AGM battery advertised as about the best thing since sliced bread didn't last two years, and worked poorly for six months prior to its two year anniversary.  I contacted that vendor..got NO response at all and that 'wunderkind' battery cost almost TWICE as much as this Yuasa.  If I find this battery does not hold up, this review will certainly be updated.  Some notes of note.  This information from Yuasa for this battery:  'You will need 30.4 ounces of acid to activate this battery. The correct SG would be 1.265.  I charged the battery as per the included instructions.  The battery tends to fully charge to around 12.8V.  I'm not counting 'flash' or 'surface' numbers..but what the battery settles to.  Certainly, I don't get the starter motor speed from this battery that I did off the AGM..when it worked.  An AGM battery will settle to well over 13V..likely 13.2V or so.  BUT..if a battery doesn't last two years (correctly stored and treated), I consider it to be a lousy battery.  ..like that big yellow booger of an AGM battery was lousy.  **update** Purchased in April of 2014, it is now September of 2016.  This battery went dead with no warning, no indication of problem or of being tired.  That's bad.  I used to trust Yuasa....have for almost 50 years.  No more.  This battery is a loser.
B00LUXZCTA|5|Boy oh boy<br />Podium superbike , my hat goes off to you guys<br />Very professional honest patient<br />They operate perfect like a honda cbr 2007 600<br />I love doing buisness with them<br />Can't wait for my next order<br />Keep it up guys
B005JVNQPQ|5|My wife is very tought on her garden tools and doesn't clean them after each use & by the end of the season the tools are pretty rusty. Workshop Hero is a Hero because it removes the rust without damaging anything and I can avoid having to buy another expensive set of tools. I'd recommend this for virtually any type of tool that can be submersed in liquid; I would be careful with items with leather handles like some knives with stacked leather washers but appears safe on rubber & micarta.
B0002MAWX6|3|Guess I should have read between the lines... Just ended up being a little less than desired, although it arrived on schedule.
B00KLCI91Y|5|Awesome delivery was fast and very happy with my purchase Thanks !!!
B000N4YGMQ|1|Magnets too weak doesn't hold anywhere!!couldn't take out the screws to put on the batteries and when i did the light would work whenever they wanted too.
B005U8IRYI|5|Awesome product! Best quick release on the market!
B000C8ES6C|5|excelente
B003CJN96S|5|Good stuff.
B0046I3I8I|2|Product was defective when it arrived, one of the wheel covers  was unstiched at the seam, I had to sew it together, They did fit my tires perfectly, did not have time to send it back.
B005DMEUV0|5|I just installed these on my car yesterday and they look great! Although  the installation took longer than I hoped (45 minutes to 1 hour) I was able to use the included instructions along with the website to get these covers all set up!
B00HR26TOU|5|Easy to install and excellent quality. This gives the car a very exquisite look over the stock lights. Over all great buy
B004QF1JFU|5|I bought these gloves for a motorcycle course I was taking...they worked perfectly for the course.  Fit was extremely well (I am a woman).  Class went well, then I bought a Harley and I use these gloves every time I ride.  Can't say how they will hold up over time, but they are perfect for me right now!
B00274JM7E|4|Can buy their replacement tissue packs or fits any normal tissues nicely, which makes this a good product for any vehicle. And with how inexpensive they are, I bought about 6 of them! Tempo Tissue holders for everyone!!!
B000GU0H66|5|This part worked Perfectly for my 1984 Honda Magna Motorcycle, was glad I was able to find to find the part for it
B003SBXK8C|5|I have searched for a helmet that I would love for riding our ATVs.  I bought this helmet mostly for the graphics, reviews and price.  All the helmets I saw in our town were $100 plus.  The helmet arrived and fit perfectly (I ordered a medium).  The sun shield is easy to use even when wearing bulky winter gloves, the slide is on top of the helmet.  It comes down a lot further than the shield on my husband's and I feel that it adds protection from wind.<br /><br />I haven't worn this in warm weather, just the cold winter weather of North Dakota.  There is air that comes through the visor so it feels cool instead of hot.  My head didn't sweat like my husband's did in his helmet.  Nice ventilation when I want it or I can shut the vents to stop it.  The nose piece is nice, but was removed immediately as it only fogged up my glasses and the shields.  I wear a half face mask and that relieves some of the cold.<br /><br />It's not heavy like some helmets, but not super light.  It feels durable.  I like the reflectors on the back, these help when you are riding ATV at night on country roads.<br /><br />My only complaint was a flaw in the graphics.  But that happens.  And unless I point it out you really can't see it.
B00132CG4M|5|Simple, functional, works exactly as promoted, easy to install and saves on the back! The price is very fair. Very happy with this product!!
B009V9AAGU|4|Smells great. Looks awesome.
B00BUJ5SAW|5|This is the real-deal OEM part.  Buy with confidence.  Your BMW will be very happy to have a genuie BMW part.
B00N7KNDBI|5|would this number plate surround fit our plates here in good old New Zealand Esther Edwards,esther.joy.ed12@gmail.com
B00B0ZA90K|5|Purchased item over a year ago.  Installation instructions were perfect - install was a breeze.  I put it in my Western golf cart dash.  It has been trouble free and the custom upgrades for the 'look' of the speedometer are incredible, i.e.; lighting, colors, font, logos, etc., etc., etc.!!  Don't miss the chance to spice-up-your-ride with any of their awesome products!!  Richard from California
B00H36Y2JO|5|I have a few large 6V batteries sitting around my shop, so I bought this regulator so I could use my XGS9 solar panel to charge them from time to time. I also bought the 12V regulator for the rest of my batteries. These regulators are very well made, and work great. They have an LED that lights up if you hook up to the battery backwards which is useful. They also have a bright LED that clearly shows when they are charging. If a dark cloud passes over the sun, you can actually see the LED turn off, and then fade back on when the sun comes back out. It seems to work well.<br /><br />I originally planned on just rotating a few panels around to different batteries once a week or so, but after using the xgrid products for a while, I think I am going to buy some more panels and just keep them connected all of the time. Both the panels and regulator are very rugged and well made. You can't go wrong with these.
B009PJJI8M|5|It fits my VW Passat 2001, and it was very convenient to purchase it online for such an affordable price than having to track it down at a dealership.
B00IBOLYFC|5|I got this few days ago and no complains! they are amazing! and above all fits perfectly. (Honda Accord 2014 sedan, sport)
B00I53Y20S|5|Fit's perfect to my Jeep Grand Cherokee 2002!
B0006H933M|5|I was apprehensive about purchasing and installing by myself.  I have a small travel trailer and had to use some small tools to get to everything but the product and the instructions that went along with it were exactly what I had hoped for.
B004XEQMLU|5|Awesome keychain. I drive a Scion TC and it's nice to have a matching keychain. So far no problems with the letter peeling off
B0012UK3M2|4|the big difrence for me is no longer having 2 noticeable beams. now there is one rectangular field of light with a different whiter color and much improved side vision. very happy with them....hope they last....letcha know if they dont!
B00G49NYT0|5|This takes most of the elbow grease out of cleaning my painted white wheels. It's awesome.
B000S2VXBU|3|This looked like a direct replacement and seemed to work fine.  6 months later is does not work and I had to have it replaced.
B000GZVIJG|5|Great addition to my 14 year old motorcycle. Already has paid for itself on the road. Fits nicely in my saddlebag. Also received this product quickly.
B003INQ8QQ|3|Frist cup lasted a couple of weeks before it stop working .But they are just the right size for what i need hope the second one will last longer.They do warm up good and are not as heavy as the last one i had
B000OUW78O|5|Well worth the money I paid very decent quality for the price and worked well every time no complaints about it
B00480FHIS|4|Priced a little high, but these are an odd bulb that nobody carries in the parts shops around here.  No issues but I wish they were cheaper.
B00ANR0L36|5|Perfect
B00513G82U|3|i like it got plenty if of space it will hold alot of stuff good shipping . the only thing the bracket was supposed too fit any bike but it dont i had to make a bracket
B000DT7Y7A|5|good pump
B0014B5X4W|1|Wrong parts for my truck so was not happy . Had to go to auto parts store an pay new parts.
B0009TS0WC|5|Best price out there.  This is the 2nd one I bought within a month since I left the 1st one sitting on my bumper.  Since I bought a new trailer I needed this adapter so the brakes would unlock when I shifted into reverse.  I should probably buy another one for when I lose it again.  Using on my 2008 Toyota Tundra.
B003L2ZVRG|5|Have used Honey Leather Conditioner for several years.   It is the best product I have found to condition & soften our leather furniture.
B00IS91J9Q|5|Bought this for my husband as a gift and he really likes them.
B002EBSLA4|5|sweet
B0012ETPUE|5|I have been purchasing the Sylvania Headlights for several years now, and they are excellent!  They have bright beams and illuminate very well the road ahead - have always been satisfied with them.  I have recommended the brand to others that I work with.  I highly recommend them!
B00D79XAQC|3|Love the concept. The device came in and the laser did not work. My issue is the the tracking is not very smoth.it is sticky which makes it difficult to opporate
B006ONRYWO|5|Fit Polaris 570 Sportsman great, look nice.
B005LEZUDC|5|Just as if I bought it in the park.
B000A2N7K8|5|This replaced our old KleerTemp thermometer that we have use for at least twenty years.  The old one still worked very well, but after many years and at least five different homes the white edging on the numbers had faded away, making it a little hard to read at night.  The original was a gift, and I recommend this as a modest cost, very useful, long lasting gift.  Or just buy one for yourself.
B00KTIQU4I|1|the network quality was very cheap
B00HJDJAKM|5|been looking for this a very long time
B00FY19Y84|5|The sticker is perfect. The item arrived on time and was exactly as described. I've been looking for one of these for a while and this one was everything I ever wanted.
B004I0KABW|5|Bien
B004J9FVR0|5|Fit the 2008 Acadia perfectly.  After removing worn out supports per instructions found online, StrongArm supports simply popped right on.  One tip...after attaching end to liftgate, use pliers to carefully turn other end of support slightly so that it faces the right way.  After doing that it was easy to snap into place. StrongArm supports seem slightly stiff but much stronger than OEM supports.  Can't speak to durability yet but the cost and convenience savings of doing the repair ourselves with the StrongArm supports over having to take it to dealer for repair make this a win!
B0047FR70U|4|I purchased as a gift for my fifteen year old son who loves Fox and his favorite colors are red and black. I have not seen him wear it.
B000H94F6E|5|this was a gift and with the easy of usage was a no brainer.  Just plug it in and hook it up and the unit does the rest.
B000ZANVBU|5|These seat covers fit perfectly.  They are very comfortable and do not slide or come undone.  They look and feel like they came with the vehicle.  Immediate improvement to looks and comfort.
B00OVC4D2O|5|These look great on the car....it's something you don't see often at all and it adds a very cool but subtle element to an already luxurious car....
B00GPUKSLA|2|Didn't smell like lavender. Not as fragrant as I would like. I will stick with diffusers.
B00032K32A|5|good stuff
