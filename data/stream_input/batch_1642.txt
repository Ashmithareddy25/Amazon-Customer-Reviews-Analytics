B0085X31VE|5.0|I cannot get over how good this album is. I just randomly came across this group on youtube and I'm so glad I did. At first I thought, hmm, progressive black metal, that's interesting. Then I kept listening and I was so impressed I had to buy the CD on the spot. All the musicians in this group seem like virtuosos. Everything is so tight and perfect and the songs, no, the arrangements are so well done from start to finish. This album deserves to be listened to on a nice stereo system with good speakers at high volume. Also, I'm not a fan of Opeth, Between the Buried and Me, or Devin Townshend, so I won't even compare Ne Obliviscaris to anything like that. To me, it's just not in the same ball park. Just get this album right now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game has always been epic across various platforms. That hasn't changed with this app. You have to remember that with this version as it rewinds Minecraft back a year or so. The version that is being downloaded 0.4.0 Alpha, so expect it to be brought up to current standards over the coming months.<br /><br />The controls seem awkward at first. Plus there is the \\"mystery factor\\" of figuring them out with tutorial, like all Minecraft games. Suffice to say, after 10 minutes, they became natural and was able to begin wailing away at some stone. Some people complain about the same hand handling jump, and that actually ISN'T a problem. The game finally autojumps for you, so you can actually get out of your deep mines faster. Doing a standing long jump isn't hard though: I tapped jump and then forward... it worked fine and easy so I am not sure what is the problem. Granted you have people also decrying that this doesn't work on Kindle Fire, so who knows the motives of those users. :-)<br /><br />Major differences include the fact that the quick bar has less slots. It's not been that bad as long I remember to keep what I want in those slots. There is no hunger meter. Chests are limited to small. You are blocked from setting two chests next to each other. I am sure this is in anticipation of adding large chests without glitching in the future.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a Minecraft player, you will not be disappointed with this iteration. It takes you back a bit, but not so far that you will be impatient for the future upadtes - Trust me, it's great right now.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|We have this video on dvd, but now my 6 yr old daughter wanted to buy it for the ipad.  She loves the movie!
B008C1O8CA|5.0|For those fans who were frustrated with 21st Century Breakdown, this album is for you! It's been a long time since we heard Green Day just having fun. As the title of my review suggests, this album is fun, fast, and catchy. It's a blast!
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game....I play all the time and I'm addicted to it. sometimes it lags and makes me mad. o well stol love it
B000JK8OYU|4.0|LOVE the Beatles, like this album. One reviewer said it best: it is a Beatles extravaganza. When I play it, it is often as background to anything else I may be doing (cooking, cleaning, writing, or drawing).<br />NEGATIVES: I find that I'm fairly moody about it; sometimes I enjoy the transitions and remixes--and length, while other times I just get annoyed, eject the disk, and spin a good ol' fashioned album from the band, in its original form.  Also, Sun King is a god-awful experiment (it's called \\"Gnik Nus,\\" and played backwards). Stupid.<br />POSITIVES: The clarity is incredible; While My Guitar Gently Weeps, a song I never really liked very much, sounds AMAZING on this album, and completely converted me; finally, they didn't mess a whole lot with A Day In the Life, if at all, which was a very smart move. Arguably the best Beatles song ever written and performed. No need to get crazy there.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I found this product by searching for \\"kindle fire case\\" on Amazon. After reading multiple reviews I decided it was for me and bought it. Imagine my surprise why the case came and it DIDN'T FIT my 7\\" Kindle Fire! This is a terrible product that does not do what it claims.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|After the first 10 times or so of having sex, it became predictable. While definitely a different kind of sex than I am accustomed to, it became not so exciting. Could have done without so much of it.<br />As for the story line, it mimicked the old Harlequin romances of the 70s.<br />If I'd known what it was really like, instead of just the hype, I would not have bought it.
0316228532|4.0|The portrayal of the characters on this book is very deep and real and as original as if someone really lived through the situations, totally different from her previous published Harry Potter fantasy series.<br /><br />I think it is kind of risky for J.K. Rowling to try a totally different audience category since she had tremendous success in the children/teen areas.  However, it also shows that she is willing and confidence to try it without worrying about the result.  She really can afford to write whatever she likes and that makes this book very personal (to what she likes to write about and what she experienced or witnessed in her life).<br /><br />We certainly miss her unique capabilities on creating the Harry Potter series and hoping that she would continue on that path.  Harry Potter had motivated millions of children to read, which was a huge success consider we are living in a world of video games and movies.  I still hope that she will create another fantasy series (friendly for all ages) that will lead more children to read and even to write their own stories.  Her success in writing and how that changes her life and status in the world is so amazing.<br /><br />Keep up your GREAT work, J.K.!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|its simple to navigate and easy to organize your notes. I love it. everyone should have this app because its just so good
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was an \\"easy\\" read with a powerful and thought provoking message.  The book gave me a message in an easy to understand, yet timely message.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've been a Jack Reacher fan for years - enjoying each and every book by Lee Child.  I'm sorry to say that \\"Wanted Man\\" is somewhat of an exception.  I found the first half of the book a challenge to read - more than half is comprised of discussions between a hitchhiker, Jack Reacher, and three characters who pick him up in Nebraska.  Something is not quite right as they travel toward Chicago - stopping twice en route to be questioned at two different state police roadblocks.  The book trailer states that nobody is telling the truth and nothing is as it seems. A true statement, which makes the story hard to follow.<br /><br />The second half of the book starts rolling when Reacher is shot at by one of the passengers - leaving him for dead while the trio make their escape from this nosy passenger. The story gains momentum here and the picture becomes clearer.  This portion of the story is much more enjoyable to read, written in the typical Reacher fashion of past novels...Jack must out-think,out-smart and overpower the enemy in swift calculated movements if he is to survive. I could not put the book down from this point on.  Now I'm looking forward to the next story to see if Reacher ever makes it to Virginia to meet the female who's voice captivated him in the previous story.<br /><br />I did also learn something from \\"Wanted Man\\" that will guarantee me winning some wagers at the bar - I can now talk for over a minute without using the letter \\"A\\" in any of my words.<br /><br />John Podlaski, author<br />\\"Cherries - A Vietnam War Novel
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I pre-ordered this book and read several negative reviews on it before I started it.  Unlike some, I enjoyed the segment of the car ride - I slipped into Reacher-think mode and enjoyed parsing the clues right along with him.  And of course there was plenty of action in the story when crunch time arrived.  Now, I am waiting for the next installment - will Reacher FINALLY make it to Virginia, and what will he think of Susan when he finally meets her??  I do hope Lee is already at work on this storyline.......
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved it. Honestly I think every highschool student could relate to it in one way or another. I'd definitely reccomend it(: Can't wait to see the movie!
0385344333|3.0|It's always nice to have Reacher back.<br /><br />This time he's in the driver's seat, literally. He's hitch-hiking again and this time, it turns out to be beyond dangerous.<br /><br />Jack shows up with a broken nose, but standing upright, sticking his thumb out and \\"trying to look friendly\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's not going to make it all the way to Virginia - not tonight, anyway. He's got some bad guys to handle.<br /><br />A man is murdered in cold blood. Two men slink away from the crime, 'jacking' a car on the getaway. They've kidnapped a woman and now they've picked up Jack on the side of the road. Only they don't know that Jack has particular skills.<br /><br />A good mystery for Jack to work out. I was a little disappointed that Jack was so willing to stack up the body count seemingly without much evidence. That's why I gave it 3 stars.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is everything it says it is. you have a great visual and you can change the color of the battery. an all around great app.
B0088X7YU0|4.0|I have never read the novel but enjoyed the first Starship Troopers movie for what is it was, an action movie with political satire.  If you enjoyed the first movie you'll like this one.  It contains new characters and the return of Carmen, Ricco and Carl years later.  How much later I am not sure.  But the movie was entertaining with good animation great action and a good story.
B005LAII1C|2.0|I was expecting much more from this movie. It did not have very good acting, and the bear was just stupid. I almost felt like I should laugh at parts just because I knew that was were the joke was.<br /><br />This movie is a good time waster so rentable, but not buyable.
006441034X|3.0|Love the story...but the condition of the book isn't very good.  The speed at which I received my order was fast.  The book looked good on the outside, but I have to be very gentle and careful when I open in because the inside binding is cracking and ready to fall apart.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|What was this movie all about? Did all the funny parts get put into previews? This movie was not funny or entertaining. This is one of only a hand full of movies that I almost stopped watching. It seemed to have no rhyme or reason for anything. I rented this movie because I like Johnny Depp. I have liked a lot of his movies. This was a complete dud!<br /><br />I cannot in good concise even say it is rentable or a time waster. It is neither. Just skip this one.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game on my Kindle Fire! Now you will see that a lot of reviews say it lags...well it does, BUT it maybe lags 1 out of 50 times for me, because all you need to do is optimize before you start up the game, and you are fine, Problem Solved! I would also like them to update so that you can disable powerups, like on other devices. Other than that this game is very enjoyable and one of my favorite games right now!
B005LAIHZE|1.0|I am not going to waste much time on this.<br /><br />Terrible, Terrible, terrible! You can't be serious.<br /><br />Not a good movie, not a time waster, not rentable, and of course do not buy this. Flush your money elsewhere.
B008D30K7E|1.0|I thought the book was very poor and so ludicrous that it was not even funny. I struggled to finish it. It has taken me weeks and normally I would read a book in a day or two.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|This was a typical bond style movie, or worse. It's plot twists were predicable, the action senses were below average, but wait there's more he has two genes altered so he can do anything. Let the adventure begin, wow. How is it that you can shoot rockets, machine guns, grenades, etc and they never seem to die.<br /><br />We need new writers in Hollywood.<br /><br />It is a good movie for a time waster so rentable, but not buyable.
B004I654WQ|5.0|The price for this DVD/Blu-ray was the best. This movie came on Disney and my 2year old loved it and couldn't stop watching it. So, I went to target to search for it. To my suprise the DVD alone was 19.99. So I looked on-line to see if I could fine a better deal and I did. Amazon had the best deal, I purchased it from my phone while still in Target. I received e-mail confirmation immediately and the DVD was in my mailbox three days later. Let's just say my son is a happy camper!
B005LAIHQS|3.0|I seen the previous two MIB movies so I thought I might as well watch the third. A lot of the time the third movie falls way short. This one was no blockbuster, but it did not fall short either. I thought the movie stayed true to the core of the rest of the MIB movies without getting to crazy or turning into a back to the future movie. It also did not go into some long winded discussion about not bumping into someone you know or the fabric of time will rip.<br /><br />This movie is a good time waster so rentable, and if you are into the MIB series enough buyable, not for me though.
B003N5VOUO|1.0|This film is so ridiculous and unbelievable, it's laughable.  It could have been good, it really could have.  The filmmakers made it WAY too long, and tried to tackle WAY too many themes and issues for one movie.  The film also left a really bad taste in my mouth, because it reinforced these ideas: 98% of white Americans are ignorant, racial-profiling, anti-Muslim idiots, 99% of Indians living in the US are way more compassionate and open minded than other Americans, there was mass anti-Muslim chaos happening all over the US after 9-11, black people are much nicer than white people, George Bush is mean and impersonal and Barack Obama is friendly and personable, etc etc etc.  The hurricane scene was COMPLETELY over the top-  I can't believe anyone could even watch it with a straight face, let alone release it as a \\"serious\\" scene.  Please don't waste your time with this movie- it's way too unbalanced, biased, and ridiculous to warrant your attention for 3 hours.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|When you can predict every turn and plot of a movie it tends to be a bit boring. CGI does not make a good movie. Also, just because it is a precursor to great films does not make it great either. If that was the case prequels to Star Wars were great films, and they were not. This movie was boring. I felt like I was watching it just to watch it. It did not grab my attention at all. Did it have a cool flying ship and futuristic guns and gadgets, yes, but so what. I almost laughed when the lady said my company spent 1 trillion dollars to go on this mission. This was meant to pop your eyes. Wow! 1 trillion dollars! That's just crazy money no wonder they have a huge spaceship. Give me a break.<br /><br />To all those reviewers who think this is going to be a classic down the road, LOL! The reason SciFi movies are classics is because the broke the mold and thought outside the box. This is just remade for the next generation.<br /><br />Not a great movie but a time waster.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Been playing this game for a week now. Extremely addictive. Yes it's kind of like angry birds but not at the same time. Also yes it gets harder....it's called figure it out. To the comments that feel it's hard to get you to buy things.... The real gamers called, they said get over it cry baby and figure out how to beat it. I did and I bought nothing. 2 points for me! Lol.
B005LAII3U|1.0|Classics beware. Your movie just might be remade in 10 years for the next generation. Just because you have CGI and huge explosions that take down a whole city block does not mean it is a great movie. They need to stop remaking these movies and start thinking again.<br /><br />I can say that this is a good time waster so rentable, but do not buy it. It is not worth the extra money.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book has an appealing title and triggers your interest to buy it. Once you start reading you realize that this book only covers in a small part what you had expected - the hunt for and killing of Bin Laden.<br /><br />It starts with the very mission to get him but is then interrupted by narrations about past training sessions and previous missions.<br /><br />The book is still interesting though but it could have been a lot shorter and more focussed on what the title is promissing.<br /><br />Nils from Berlin, Germany
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I cannot believe how many bad rating this movie got.<br /><br />This has been one of the better movies of the year. I thought it was a good take on an old classic. The CGI was good, but not crazy to the point of unbelievable. Overall I would give this movie a B.<br /><br />It is a good time waster so rentalbe and it is buyable.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|Worked fine at first.even after the last two updates including todays app is not working.What's up I bought it when you had it on google and where is my money.
0345803485|2.0|I too was referred to this book from a friend (also a mom with young children) and of course heard about it from the news and TV/magazines.  I hadn't read a good book in a long time and finally thought I found one...<br /><br />my friend said it would be a fast read...and it was....you know why? because the second half of the book..i totallly turned it page by page, skimming...it was so boring and repetitive, no storyline, just sex sex sex...i could not take it..just stopping to read other parts (when she visits her mom etc)...way too hyped and very disappointed in this book.  too much of nothing.  don't recommend it unless you have a lot of time and idle time....otherwise I have read better books
B008XG1X18|4.0|seems a little more confusing to use and find friends on the app than the browser or phone however I enjoy the flexibility of using accessing it anywhere
1932100660|3.0|The only problem i had with this book was i felt the actual data, the actual findings of the China Study took up all of 3 chapters. It may have been my fault, assuming the book was just going to be about the findings. But i sort of lost interest half way through. I felt the same topics/facts/etc.. were being repeated. I read my share of articles and health-related books and besides the actual China Study data within this book..I've read it all before, nothing new.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just loved this book! I couldn't put it down. The details author Suzanne Collins gave made you believe you were right there in the arena with Katniss and Peeta.
B009B51K9U|5.0|I'm really really impressed with this album so far. It really is a fun one to listen to, and reminds me so much of my high school days listening to Dookie and Nimrod. Green Day is returning to it's roots and really appealing to it's core audience, I believe. Glad that I purchased this, and for the $5 deal, you can't beat it. I'm more old school and usually buy physical CDs (not a fan of digital downloads as much), but can't beat the price. Go get this album!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was very excited to buy this book for my Kindle Reader but...$17.99...are you kidding ? In this economy ??
1574216988|5.0|This is a comprehensive guide for the new tangler. Lots of examples, fun and satisfying. Better than the other books I have purchased on Zentangle! I reccommend it highly.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|This was TReacher at his best and certainly makes you wonder just how many more sutuations Childs has up his sleeve.<br />Keep them coming
B0091REZMW|4.0|love this game. happy to finally get it on my kindle but upset because while I'm waiting for my energy to rebuild my coins are being depleted. that shouldn't happen.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I have been using this app for some time now but it decided to stop working for me all of a sudden. It keeps saying to check my connection but my internet connection is fine.  Ibe uninstalled and reinstalled nothing works :( looks like i have to find another downloader smh
B008476HBM|5.0|The reading experience was pleasurable due to the contrast between black text and white page background. I would have loved to see illustrations though.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book and series are great. Very good character development and story line. Quick read and very entertaining! I recommend this to everyone. I can't wait until the 6th and 7th books come out.
B008NR90HQ|5.0|Not too long as 74 minutes but even 5 minutes of gary lasts a lifetime when you see him play. Great versions of the songs in my opinion and voodoo child was a brutal version of all the versions have seen through the years as only gary could pull off....Was a bit confused on the liner and at the show saying he is one of the best british guitar players as he was born in belfast,Ireland?<br />But realize he lived almost all of his life in England so probably consider him a local no doubt. Another must have for Gary Moore devotee's like myself that play almost every night his concerts after all are asleep and wonder what could have been in the future from the master. A++++++
B004UID2LC|5.0|feiggin tight. best app in the market. great for down loading all kinds of videos and music. works good on GS3
1439153663|5.0|Wow. This was a great novel.  I was totally immersed in the novel and held captive by its depth. The characters come alive and leap off the pages. At times I felt I was there. Please read this one... it does not disappoint.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|I've wanted my own copy of this movie for a while now.  Thanks to my daughter Ashley for her gift money, I now own Amelie!  Amelie is a very creative, thoughtful, and colorful movie that makes you think.  Love it!
B00846REIS|3.0|I saw this book after reading the Fifty Shades series.  I decided to purchase and read on my Kindle.  At first I compaired the writing to Fifty Shades. There are some similarities. I did end up really liking the story, though the ending was lacking for me.  I will read the follow up story.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie was pretty faithful to the book.  I agree with one of the critics that the shaky camera thing wasn't necessary all the time but it did give it that feel of reality.  Katniss was well very well cast and the way the Capitol residents were dressed was very close to the way I imagined them.  Well done.  I'm looking forward to the next one!
B009AMAKJU|5.0|I found the book to be enjoyable and just as entertaining as the Movie. Both book and Movie are compelling with intense drama from beginning to end. The engaging story tugs at the heart, and the entire colorful cast of characters in the film did a great job of performance as we follow Charlie's footsteps into a circle of friends to compensate the emotional trauma in his life. After seeking therapy for his social problems, he meets two friends and is taught how to party. Every character has problems from a troubled past, some learn to cope and others cannot get past a tragic event. The themes for this movie is finding love, being accepted, learning to cope, and the true meaning of friendship. Many viewers will be able to relate to the emotional trauma, and some viewers may find it difficult to relate if flashbacks of a troubled past are too disturbing. Overall, the characters light up the screen, and the heartfelt story keeps your attention throughout. Highly Entertaining from beginning to end!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Every indie author I've seen is now putting posts on Twitter and Facebook advertising their own erotic literature with a reference to this book. It's THAT big. J.K. Rowling big.<br /><br />I don't quite buy into all the hype, erm, but I have bought each book in the trilogy. Sure it's over-hyped, but its actually pretty good - and a triumph for authors who start off writing indie fan fiction and aspire to greater things.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|My wife and I are big SOA fans and being able to sit and watch the previous season without commercials is great. The price made it even better... Thanks Amazon for the great bargain!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I saw that people put how it was hard to get more coins but i know a cheat code. If you go and set your  date for a day ahead then you will automatically regain all your coins. Hope thos helped!
B0086700CM|5.0|I find it very funny the way the man just rushes out the temple..lol... He must of stolen from those monkeys before and it finally caught up with him.. lmao
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is very good.  It ranks right up there with Tolkein's books.  I'm looking forward to reading the entire series.  If it's all as good as the first two, I'll be a very happy camper.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I dare you to play just one game.<br />its stimulating and keeps your brain sharp.  Wish school was this stimulating.
B008220AVW|5.0|This is an outstanding movie about Katy starting out and growing through the years, and getting more and more popular!!!  She sings songs from her concert, and I just loved the movie<br />thoroughly.  She is a magnificent Pop Princess, and I think this DVD will prove it to you.  It shows the good times, and the sad times of her success, but she's still number one with me!!  Bill board is naming her \\"Women of the year\\" in Music history, with her top songs, and her movie, and her touring all around the world!!  I don't know how she did it, or where she got the energy!!!<br />She is a great performer!!
B0041CPG2U|5.0|This has to be one of Charlie Sheen's best episodes ever.  They really nailed the female \\"Buffalo Herd\\" mentality.  I had this on an old DVR that I no longer use.  Glad I could find it again on Amazon, and can now access it from anywhere.
B007M45PMU|4.0|A friend first recommended The Lumineers to me because I liked Mumford and Sons. If you like soothing, folksy music, listen!
0316228532|1.0|Well the book was so-so.  Ms. Rowling should stick to her original audience. I actually borrowed the book since I would never pay $17.99 for<br />a Kindle book.<br />Amazon roped us all in with this initial prices, remember?  Now we are starting to see what's coming.  Of course it could mean a resurgence<br />of bookstores I suppose.
B0091XRL86|4.0|I watched this movie with my 6 year old son. We both loved it. Few 6 year olds can avoid the alure of a priate movie and there's pleny of humor that most adults can appreciate.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Perhaps it was all the media hype that made me buy this book; to see what it was all about, or maybe it was just a desire to read a good book. My budy and I practically raced our way through this book and within two days we were both finished with it and rereading it.  Mr Owen did an amazing job of detailing his time as a SEAL and also does an amazing job of making you feel like you are in the helo with him and his team.  I'd recommend this to you so much I bought it for my dad to read!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this game when it was the free app of the day.  I LOVE this game and the non-color version too.<br />The only problem with this game is that I'm color deficient, so it makes it a little hard for me to play, but there are little things that help me with playing it.  Like having the number of colored blocks being a different color.<br />In closing I would recommend this game to any one I know.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Very Emotional and Touching.<br />So sad to loose such a caring person. He was so concern for others and many never realized the real person.<br />God Bless his family, loved ones, and all.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|great movie, great book.  the series, however is debatable.  I wait with anticipation the next movie, but honestly, based on the book alone, i'm  (sadly) skeptical.  If they altered the book's story, it could be amazing....and i could be hooked for a while.  I'll admit, i've watched this 3 times in the last month.  :P  I dont' know, i just really identify with Katniss.  great movie--particularly if you like archery, hunting and female empowerment.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Great album - took a while to get used to - especially the title track. But it is now firmly esconced in the pantheon of his great albums. Worth every penny. Bob Dylan is truly a national treasure.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great to have access to this wonderful app on my favorite kindle! I could and sometimes do spend hours on pinterest. so engaging and entertaining. the sky's the limit to fun on Pinterest!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|Amazing record, each track is beautiful. Will be listening to this for a very long time (:<br />Congrats on getting out there, Imagine Dragons!!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The first half of the book flows well, the two strands moving along and slowly joining up, the tension building. Reacher's deductions of the situation are clear and clever. The second half becomes clogged, too many doors to open, too many shots missed and the deus ex machina saviour unrealistic. Also very annoying for a non-USA resident is the interminable references to locations, highways and States, requiring detailed map knowledge, when, really, it doesn't matter. The first Reacher book that has disappointed me, not enough meat and the tension just slips away in the last chapters.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|In my quest to build a quality gaming PC on a budget I stumbled upon the i3-3220.  It's a powerful current generation processor that will ensure your system is future proofed for several years to come.  For $5 you get a 10% improvement in performance over last year's i3-2120 so, why not?  I bought this off Newegg but there are no reviews up on Amazon, so I'll give you one!<br /><br />While there are games out that can utilize four cores there aren't a whole lot of them out there.  Including new releases you'll be able to play 99% of what's out on maximum settings providing you have the graphics card to match.  The only titles that won't stay at a consistent 60+ fps are games like Battlefield 3 where you have enormous 64 player games.<br /><br />In my Steam library the most graphic intensive games I have are the Crysis games, a heavily modded Skyrim, Arkham City, and Max Payne 3.  So far, they've all been at a consistent 60+ fps with everything turned up.  I know for a fact the upcoming titles I'm interested in (Black Ops 2, Tomb Raider, Crysis 3) will play the same.<br /><br />So, if you're on a budget and want to save the $100 I can safely recommend this over the 3570K.  You also save money on a third party heat sink.  At idle I'm seeing 28-33c and 60ish on a full load.  I'm very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />My Build:<br />Gigabyte GA-Z77-D3H<br />Intel Core i3-3220<br />G. Skill Ares Series 8GB (2x4) RAM<br />HIS Iceq X 7850 (OC'd)
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Fine I won't write any comments if I can't just five star the book!<br />Everyone knows it's good anyway - why read the reviews?
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I love all of the Sex and the City seasons, as well as the first movie, and I loved this as well. I hope there will be a third movie. I wish they would never stop:)
B008GANNIC|5.0|POD is truly an amazing group. I listen to not only the music but to every word Sonny sings. Something always hits home now matter how often I listen to their music. Thanks Guys!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I absolutely loved this album. This is one of the few albums where there wasn't one song that I disliked.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This season may very well be the best. Things get SO intense, especially the last half of the season. Way to go FX!!!!
0762777931|5.0|I have owned this book for over a year and just bought another for a friend. Kris is smart, funny, clever, an amazing writer, and really took control of her life situation. I devoured this book from cover to cover upon receipt. I have absolutely spread her word. She is so inspiring that I have adopted her way of eating (JUICING) and have completely changed my life!! I feel sooooo much better, look better, and am losing weight. There is so much power in her words and green juicing.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to take their health back, feel better, and change their lives for the best!!<br /><br />Thanks Kris for the inspiration!!
B006TJXZ30|3.0|Without Calendar and Skydrive support you really don't get anything that the Kindle Fire unified inbox gives you except a prettier in box and limited folder functionality. Come on Microsoft you can do better  than that......
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|I liked the concept, but the controls got sluggish (Kindle Fire). At some point toward the end of every game it stopped responding to touch screen input - tap 5 or 6 times before it would respond, and by that time it was too late to line up your squares and the game was quickly lost. It was frustrating and I didn't think it was going to help the kids with their math fluency so I uninstalled it.<br /><br />Update: after re-install, it works much better now on the Fire. Thanks! I don't know how long it will keep the kids' interest, but for now they're playing it. (I enjoy it too, starts off a little slow for me, but wouldn't want it any faster for the kids.)
B00881VLCE|5.0|a wonderful,  relaxing way to kill time (instead of people) while waiting in line.<br />the puzzles are challenging and delightful to look at. download. and enjoy,  price cannot be best.
0756407125|5.0|This is a truly excellent series thus far. Well written, fabulous world building, engaging characters and situations.  Between the two books there are about 2000 pages (at least on my ereader), and I finished both in under a week. With stories like this who needs TV?<br /><br />My big question - with this series as his debut, what's next???<br /><br />Oh - and a note for Patrick - HURRY UP with the next one!!!!  please, bitte schoen, pozhaluisto, s'il vous plait.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I can not get this to work on my kindle fire it says connection is bad but its not I dont understand everything else works

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great Reacher book.  I've read all of this series and have enjoyed them tremendously.  One of the few authors whose books I buy without hesitation becasue I know it will be enjoyable from start to finish.
B000025JMP|5.0|\\"Elvis: That's the Way It Is\\" is a small compilation of songs from the 1970 documentary of the same name.<br /><br />The primary weakness of this disc is that it's missing some notable songs from the setlist such as \\"Suspicious Minds,\\" \\"In the Ghetto,\\" \\"Can't Help Falling in Love,\\" and performances of his older hits, among others.  However, this flaw is relatively small as these songs can be found on other collections.  The tradeoff is a compilation of songs performed by Elvis that might not be as well-known in the popular consciousness, but are executed with a level of depth, energy, and sincerity that Elvis tapped with astonishing consistency during the early post-comeback years.  Elvis is arguably at the height of his powers here, with standout performances of \\"How the Web Was Woven\\" and \\"Patch It Up,\\" and even showing his prankster side on \\"You've Lost That Loving Feeling.\\"<br /><br />The highlight, however, is the magnificent cover of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\"  The song starts off very softly and builds to a crescendo that absolutely overwhelms the senses, particularly in the final verses when Millie Kirkham's high, distinctive voice comes through clear as a bell, nearly lifting the backup section to the same emotional level of the song as Elvis all by herself.  The disc is worth purchasing for the inclusion of this song alone.<br /><br />If you're an Elvis fan or simply enjoy a well-crafted set of songs to listen to, don't hesitate to purchase this.
B007TML4EI|5.0|At times the physics engine can be too subject to randomness(adding a beam unconnected to the structure on the other side of the field can make or break your design), but this is a fantastically engaging engineering game.  The challenges have a wide variety of difficulty, and are varied enough that you continually have to come up with new solutions.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love that I can blend my own multiple selections with this. With most similar apps you can only choose one of their offerings at a time. with this, I can have birds singing in the rain and add a flute in the background if I like ... and I do.
B0034G4P94|5.0|\\"Warrior\\" was an awesome movie and I don't even like fighting!!  The storyline will touch your soul and leave you feeling good.  The fighters aren't too bad to look at either for a couple of hours...made me want to buy the DVD!  I highly recommend this movie!  :o)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 in the trilogy.  After Ana breaks it off with Christian, his ugly past come to the fore.  I wanted to claw Mrs. Robinson's eyes out with my own freshly manicured nails!  But alas - love conquers all.  And while it's conquering - it's seriously HOT!  Yum!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever on TV, and with one of the best pilot episodes too.  It's strong from start to finish, has a realistic feeling that makes it seem like you're right there in the midst of it, and has a great cast.<br />Terrific action and tightly written stories coupled with really wonderful character development, portrayed by amazing actors - what more can you ask for?  It's a shame it was never recognized for more awards, for Goggins and Chiklis especially.<br /><br />I do have to agree that the packaging is an issue - I have a later version with the sleeves, so while the discs haven't been scratched, it is not the easiest thing to get them in and out of the box set.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book #3 of the series. True and everlasting love is never without its challenges. Christian and Ana fight through many issues including malice and hate but still manage to love each other and it will make your thighs sweat! Yum!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games book so much that I downloaded the next two books and read them all within ten days.  The stories and the characters were so much better and colourful than portrayed in the movie.  Can't recommend it highly enough
0345803507|3.0|hey sad rear the they you are gave bar star those yours hose name nome bone mob hp hit quirk
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Alot of fun, similar to Diablo 3. For a free game I think it rocks. A few small quirks but nothing to wine about, at all.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a exceptional movie. Well acted, directed, etc. and interesting location. Sometimes when you have this much acting talent in a movie it can fall flat, but not this time (the younger actors were very good as well - a nice balance). There was nothing that I didn't like about this movie and kudos for creating a story about older folks that didn't show them infirm or demented. These folks started new adventures, brought closure to lifelong desires and found a soul mate while all the time both entertaining and educating us that getting older is not necessarily the end of a full life.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|this game is amazing,  you should really get it,  I mean hey its free you don't like it you can easily uninstall get memory back without a cost
0345803485|5.0|I have read good and bad reviews of this one but I loved it.  I don't know that I will find a book or another trilogy that I will enjoy more.  While the characters are not what I am used to I couldn't put this one down.  I took all three books to work and left them for the book exchange and they all diappeared right away.  I think some people are embarassed and don't want anyone to know they are reading these books but I say get over it.  Enjoy the book.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|THIS is the story that started it all. The rebirth of the greatest comic book character of all time. Pulled out of the light and plunged back into the Darkest corner of our frail minds. If it wasn't for this story we wouldn't have Nolanverse. There is a Batman in all of us. We all see injustice every day in our miserable existence. Whether it's done to us or it's forced onto others. Rape, murder, or people being murdered by insurance companies who deny coverage. Jobs lost in favor of maximizing profits. Children dieing from disease and starvation. The strong always devouring the weak and helpless. We experience or witness this everyday but continue with our lives as if we are civilized. Are we? The greatest crime is corruption. Corruption of our souls. Corruption of our minds. Corruption of our hearts. Inside our shallow shell is a darkness longing for justice. We bury it. And we do it well. The dark Knight returns because evil men prevail when good people do nothing. All it takes is one. History has showed us that time and again. This is why Batman is the most beloved superhero. There's a Batman in all of us buried under superficial
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game... Very addicting. I love playing it everyday. I love the prizes and bonus coins! cant wait to unlock more stuff.
B005LAII08|5.0|My wife and I took our kids for a night out we could not have seen a better movie. Our children are  6,10,and 13 and mom and dad we all loved it now my 6 year old is a boy my 10 is a girl and the 13 is a boy again we all laughed and had a great time vary funny and good story. The story is a classic and will watch over again.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is really nice. appealing to the eyes. and it WORKS I just love all the functionality of it great app. must have for kindle fire! I don't care what other reviews say!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is fantastic - the best and easiest I've used - I HATE the calculator in my desktop and wish I could use it in the desktop!  And yes-it is so very simple!!! Just what this babyboomer wanted! Thanks!!!
B008MM9630|5.0|this game is so awesome it a good game for kindle fire it doesn't crash it and this game is a good time waster so if your a person with a kindle or something and is looking for a fun game to play this is the game to download :)!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read an average of two books a day.  Usually one is \\"heavy\\" and the other is light. I am a heavy reader.  The main character in this book is dull as are all the other characters.  The basic character formation never really gels until you finally hit the point of not caring about the characters.  This book could have been vastly improved by an experienced editor who was not afraid to \\"use the red pen\\".  I purchased this book from Amazon for my kindle.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very well written account of SPECWAR progression to Seal Team 6.  The first hand account was a humble approach to an incredible epogee of training and capability, culminating in the operation in Abottabad which killed UBL.  Fantastic easy read!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|right every time! tried to stump it and couldn't its pretty crazy! . . . . . . . . . . . .
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is such a great app. it asks you if you want to use it some times. it is a great way to get biblical info. and a good source of the lord
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Fast moving and very interesting from the SEALS perspective.  Brought into view how they regulate their lives.  Also brought new information on the background of the Bin Laden raid.  No surprise that Obama had nothing to do with the operation, other than saying ok, go ahead.
B007UXTG8M|4.0|When examined closely, it turns out sex addiction is just as debilitating and soul-crushingly painful as any substance abuse problem. Shame is like a slow motion train wreck where one can often perceive the pain before it's even felt. It's not an easy film to watch at times, but Fassbender was riveting in his stripped-down, brilliantly understated role. Bottom line, for a film buff who can appreciate the artistry of this raw character study, it might be a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood fare, but it's certainly not for everyone.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|NWU type I gear on full display in this hollywood movie.<br />HOOYAH thumbs up for me watched it five times for some good alien whooping and to their credit they did some good whooping themselves
B004OA2G0E|5.0|This album is fantastic. But it is hard to truly appreciate it without hearing it on vinyl. Some of the rich, deep, resounding tones in this music break down the limited bit-rate of digital media. Even the uncompressed WAVE files from a CD can't quite fit the bill. To hear this music correctly, you basically have to have the vinyl, a good turntable and receiver, and some excellent speakers and subwoofer.<br /><br />However, there is another important component to truly understanding how great this music is, and how great this band is. You need to hear Radiohead play this material live in their DVD (and Blu-Ray) release of \\"King of Limbs, Live From The Basement.\\" Seeing them translate the heavily machine-based studio material into a live performance with instruments pretty much proves that this band can do anything. The DVD also features the debut of Radiohead's newest member, Clive Deamer, who plays drums alongside Phil Selway, and who has joined Radiohead throughout their 2012 World Tour.<br /><br />I highly recommend listening to their other material from this time-period, including their single \\"Supercollider & The Butcher\\", and their digital single, \\"The Daily Mail & Staircase\\", which comes from the aforementioned \\"From The Basement\\" performance.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really great app for doing homework, or even work at your job! This app has everything a calculator should, and is really easy to use! Clearly printed buttons are a great way to make sure your calculation is correct, besides seeing it on the easy to read calculator screen! Love it!
B008ER9QLK|5.0|This is a phenomenal cycle.  I can say this even after seeing many Ring Cycles in my life.  The singing is top notch from everyone and the stagings are very faithful to what it seems Wagner would have wanted.  I can say that I will be watching these performances over and over again.  If you have blu-ray that is what you should purchase.  Visually, it is exquisite.<br /><br />As to the conductors, both Levine and Luisi are wonderful.  It is clear that their concepts of Wagner are different but it is important to realize that both are valid.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I thought I would not like this book. Several pages in it hooked me and I couldn't put it down.
0525457585|5.0|As a young child I would slip away into my in-house school library at lunchtimes and read this book.  The words leapt off the page and each of them were entirely magical.<br /><br />Just recently, and (now rapidly approaching middle age) I have again peeked inside its magical covers.<br /><br />With some books, the passage of time can lead to disappointment. Our memories of what we have read as children can become distorted.  Not so with this book.  It has a timeless quality.  It is a beautiful book and I thoroughly recommend it.
0375831002|5.0|I adored this book. It made me laugh, cry, and think. Set during World War 2 in Germany, this is not your average Holocaust tale. The narrator is none other than Death himself, which fits the story nicely. It was beautifully written and the further you get into it, the harder it is to put down. The characters were great, Liesel is now one of my favorite protagonists plus her papa, Rosa, Rudy, and especially Max.<br />Warning: This is one heartbreaking story but it is worth it.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Is it the app or is it youtube? I don't know. What I do know is I'm tired of. the inconsistency . All I'm looking for is a way to reliably view and download youtube videos. This ain't it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A way to organize the dozens of lists I continually need to add to or edit.  I've  barely scratched the surface of ways to use.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Child's writing is up to its usual level of fine craft and suspense. Reacher though, seems to have stalled as a character. Given this lack of development, he becomes more and more, a cartoon, a cut-out standing in for Child's commentary about life in the U.S.[[ASIN:0593065735 A Wanted Man]]
0062082353|5.0|I thought this book gave a great insight to a true American hero. I think in today's world warefare has changed and so have our soldiers. I'm glad we have men like Chris Kyle on our side!
B008RYN44U|5.0|This is a really strong CD of well crafted pop music. Gwen Stefani's voice is creative and fresh sounding on every track. Its interesting to hear the stripped down versions on the double CD edition. You really need to listen repeatedly as different textures and rhythmic elements will push forward. What a great band!
B008L1PYQU|5.0|I LOVE THE UPDATED VERSION OF THIS RECORD... In true Kiss form, take something great and make it better! Almost 40 years old and this record still ROCKS!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addictive. can't put the game down. great game for all ages. downloaded this game on all of my devices.
B004H83IG4|3.0|There has certainly been better movies but I love Ryan Gossling and this was an interesting movie.  It was a bit odd and certainly sad for both parties actually. A bit slow but I would recommend if you like Ryan Gossling.
B0057VDGNK|3.0|This sound track is more enjoyable with the film images but playing the music by itself is quite depressing apart from the first two tracks which are the best.  Overall disappointing.
B008OOYALE|4.0|this game needs goals and a way to win gold if you rank up. an it needs an app of combinations to breed dragons that you want.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Great movie, lot better than expected. More action than i thought would be in it. Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron made the movie great Would reccomend this movie if you are into scifi and fantasy.
B005LAJ1HW|2.0|The digital copy code space in the redeem paper was in blank, I can not download my digital copy<br />can you help me up??
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Very Funny I can stop play It! It has variety on game mods. The only thing is that if you start a level you can Not skip the tutorial
B0055PMJMW|4.0|Michael Connelly writes the best mysteries consistantly and these 3 short stories are a good addition to his full sized novels. The character, Harry Bosch, continues to be complex enough to be interesting and the plots always hold some surprise twists.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It starts off pretty easy, but gets harder with each level. This game really makes you think. It's an awesome game and it was free.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This handy utility is easy to use and has a nifty graphic display.  Works great on the Kindle Fire.  Highly recommended.
B002DQFHKM|5.0|Although it's questionable to show this movie to children, my father showed this older-than-we-are classic to my siblings and I in the 80s; boy am I glad he did! This soundtrack took me back to my younger days and prompted me to pop the DVD in and take a trip down memory lane... do yourself a favor and purchase!
1452110581|5.0|This is a wonderful look inside a cats mind!  I always knew they were thinking strange thoughts.  A laugh out loud charmer.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|can play now and then or endlessly when board. others seem to be so much then wait this game keeps you going.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It is mostly his life story, not up to my expectations. It is good reading if you want to know what Navy seals go thru
B004M5HUXE|3.0|it's charming, but dated.  if you can push thrugh the preachness, it is nice to know you have read one of the classics. Sex scenes wouldn't even garner a rating, these days. But members of our book club gave it a solid 3 out of g.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's easy to use and nice to have access to all the translations.  I love the audio feature,  especially the reader with the English accent on the NIV.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a fun no brainer game to play just to relax I will recommend to others just need coins quiker
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|What a great book can not wait for the next one.I have read all the books with Jack Reacher in and think it is time he had a partner as he is getting a little long in the tooth and his body will be broken and his mind will be fused.I think he needs a girlfriend as his sexual urge fades away and his new partner should take all the crap.As jack is nearly 50 and still has the brains to defend himself his body must be getting older and those of us that are passed that age know what it is like when the body starts to fail no matter how hard we try to keep fit[[ASIN:0385344333 A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel]]
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun app, very colorful and cute pics, can vary sizes. All in all worth downloading. Can time yourself and app provides variety of puzzle pics.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Levels are not hard to figure out.  It's like there's a certain way to complete each level and it's your job to figure it out. Needs more levels.
030758836X|4.0|Great sentences!<br />I think the story is clever and the characters interesting.<br />This is not a complicated story but it offers a few surprises that keep a reader reading.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is very helpful.  I can take notes on my phone and they will automatically sync and show up on my computer and other devices. The additional apps that work with this app are so helpful for collecting and storing important and miscellaneous notes.
B00887490Y|5.0|Watched this today on Netflix and wow! I loved the imagery of this movie! I was taken by total surprise at the ending as well. You do get an idea of what's going on at a certain point when she explains some things. I think this movie was wonderful and it was actually refreshing to see something different with good intentions. The sad thing is, so much of what this movie is about is true. Either way I love it and plan on adding it to my list of movies to buy! Highly recommend!
0385344333|3.0|Ridiculously pedantic explanations notwithstanding, Child's mind-numbing repetitiveness really prevented this novel from reaching the level of enjoyment I have come to expect from his Reacher series.  Maybe the next one will be better.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|Ok I didn't rate that other junk since I'm just collecting the Bella doll and not playing with it. She is so beautiful. If your fans of the movie it will make a great addition. Or if you just love beautiful dolls I highly recommend either way. She is sitting up on my Twilight bookshelf looking very elegant!
0374203032|4.0|What Money Can't Buy is an analysis of the embedded moral reasoning in economic thinking and how economic reasoning influences our norms and values.  Sandel argues that monetary transactions for goods and services does not necessarily lead to socially optimal outcomes as the framework which legitimizes the use of monetary transactions often degrades our sense of community and norms and values.  In a sense, what money cant buy is a sociology view of economics.  The book is separated into major chapters, the first tackles queuing systems, the second incentives, third is on markets and morals, fourth life insurance markets and finally naming rights and the takeover of civic life my commercial interests.<br /><br />For me, the book starts out the strongest with its chapter on queuing systems.  The paying of those with idle time to stand in line for congressional hearings by lobbyists and the selling of shakespeare in the park tickets (in manhattan) are used as examples where the norms of first come first serve are overwhelmed by auction systems and how they promote different outcomes.<br /><br />The author then goes into incentives and how when money is used to change behaviour it can be seen as a form of bribery and corruption.  In particular paying kids for grades is used as an example, paying ppl to lose weight as well as paid sterilization of crack users.  The well chosen examples by the author forces the reader to think about their value system and how it can be reconciled with \\"efficient\\" market outcomes.<br /><br />The next topic covered is how markets cannot replace certain kinds of relationships and awards.  In particular awards based on some form of well defined merit, nobel prizes, oscars etc... as well as things like friendship are corrupted if money is a factor.  The author goes on to use outcomes of specific situations and dynamics to argue that the use of markets often change the social norms of an activity and as such economics cannot be viewed as a framework to optimize outcomes but often influences the dynamics of a situation permanently.  For example when parents were made to pay a penalty for picking up their kids late, it increased late pickups as the penalty payment became viewed as a fee rather than the breaking of a social norm.  When the penalty payment was withdrawn, behaviour remained bad by parents compared to before the implementation of the payment in the first place.  Also the use of blood donation vs getting paid for blood is used to show how when paying for blood is the norm it reduces the amount of pure donors.<br /><br />The author goes on to discuss the life insurance business and the business in monetizing such claims today in return for cash leaving the buyer with a claim on someone else's life for which they have no insurable interest.  The underlying change in behaviour by those involved in these transactions here weakens compared to blood donation but nonetheless one questions why there is a place for such a market when reading the chapter.<br /><br />The author ends with a chapter on the inflitration of advertisement to community activities.  Examples of putting advertising on one's house, one's car, one's forehead are all used.  The inflitration of advertisement into sports is used as a primary example as is the magnitude of the payments.  The change in the price of tickets and the the salaries of players as well as the market value of sports paraphenelia is discussed.  This is among the weakest of chapters which relies on nostalgia and romanticism versus a strong point.  Moneyball is used as an example of how statistics has made the sport more boring rather than helped the sport.  I definitely do not find as much strength in the reasoning towards the end.<br /><br />All in all What Money Can't Buy brings up a very important point.  Economics does not exist as an intellectual discipline to be applied neutrally to improve outcomes.  It changes the framework of various situations and the resulting dynamics.  If the introduction of money changes the framework of thinking about civic duty then it influences outcomes non-neutrally.  As a result economics can tell us within a market setting the best way to facilitate trade or construct an auction but it cannot tell us that the market setting best serves the communities interests- that is for the community to decide from potentially a higher moral plane.  People have many aspects to them many of which have nothing to do with desire for money and thus money cannot be used as a measure of utility.  People believe that statement to varying degrees, but the fact that they believe in them in varying degrees means there is legitimacy to consider when market outcomes might not serve common interests.  I definitely dont believe as strongly as the author on some parts but this book needs to be considered very carefully as the main lesson has strong merit.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie but because of Taylor & Alex were in it I thought I would give it a try. Rented from Redbox Tues and loved it! With the exception of killing Eric Northman :) My favorite parts were when they got help from the old timer vets and the old battleship. And the guy that lost his legs was so awesome! It was just a great movie and I highly recommend it. I'm gonna ask for the movie for Christmas, if I can wait that long to watch it again :) Enjoy!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|This is the third book of the Fifty Shades triology and I think probably the best. It seems as if the author E.L. James has evolved into a better writer. Or perhaps there was more focus on the story line instead of just the sex. While I am all for a bit of titilation, I found the first two books quite over the top in the sexual description, and to be honest, after a while, found it quite boring to the point I simply skimmed over the \\"hot stuff\\" to get back to the story. In Fifty Shades Freed the psychological delving was interesting and lent depth to the characters rather than just portraying them as a sex mad rutting pair. I felt the scenes with Jack Hyde could have been more tense and dynamic (they were skimmed over fairly quickly), that was, after all, Christian's fear, that Jack would harm Ana, so a more intense and constructed storyline could have been adapted. However, in general, the book was quite good. I would give it three stars.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It's well written, but I don't care for the whole domination thing. Would love to read other books by this author. Until then, I doubt I'll read the remaining series.
B007SGM084|2.0|After all the hype and not being able to get the 50 Shades trio from the local library - waiting list too long!  I finally broke down and purchased the set on my Kindle. The story line was good, not great and just too much sex. I ended up after a while just flipping through the 'kinky sex-ery' parts to 'read on'. It read like best seller list bad porn cleaned up just enough to peddle off to the average Jane. Sex I love SEX, I work for a motorcycle magazine so not a prude. Don't get me wrong... so I say read it just to say you have but if I had it to do over again I would have saved my money. I definatly would NOT want to see my mother or mother-in-law reading these books. Too much TRASH not enough CLASS.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game and good graphics. Sucks when you run out of coins though,  but put it down for an hour and you'll have more.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I love superhero movies but only own two comics: Kingdom Come and this Dark Knight Returns. The comic is excellent -  wickedly funny and vicious.<br />I have seen almost all the DC Comics direct to video movies and thought they were uneven at best: Justice League Doom being the best (along with Superman Batman Public Enemies & Green Latern First Flight) and  Batman Gotham knight and Justice League Crisis on two Earths being my least favorites.<br />Batman the Dark Knight Returns Pt 1 is Great. The original comic is such a legendary and well known entity, I was worried they would ruin it but they did well.<br />It was a little to colorful - meaning I thought they would have went for a more muted coloring like the comic but overall that is my only complaint - other than missing a few cool images.<br />I am highly anticipating the relase of pt.2.<br />I was a bit disappointed there wasnt at least a cameo of big blue.
B00884GR0W|3.0|A great and well-developed game, but it crashes repetitively on the Kindle Fire. I don't know why no one has spoken about this. This is the second time this game has crashed on me and now I cant even open the app. I'm sorry, but this game was a waste of money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there should be easier games because so you can get points quicker so you can unlock more stuff also if you lose your progress then you can get up to speed at ko time at all.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Its great! Especially when I'm in a hurry and I can't wait for my computer to load or the news to come on. It's fast, easy, and free. Love it!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I wish there were more and more of these games they are amazing........ I couldn't stop playing it it is soooooo addicting
B008602KQI|1.0|Save your money on this one.  Unless you enjoy long, drawn-out dialogs with little or no action.  Very boring and couldn't finish the last half-hour.  It's kind of like survivor with less action and disconnected story line.  Can't imagine why it won so many awards.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Purchased the book for my husband, a tough one to please.  He could not put it down.  The details were fascinating, intense and captivating.  He was hungry for more on the subject!
B001KWP54S|5.0|If you love the blues, you will love this album!  I'm from Memphis and listening to this album is like going home.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|its a good port of the game, but I wish it had all the mini games and the zen garden of the pc version...
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Like alotta people who saw the promos for this, I went mostly to see the \\"Man Candy\\" (treat myself)... I expected some mindless entertainment with hopefully a good story thrown in.<br /><br />I'd heard mixed reviews about this movie goin in but I put that out of my head so I wouldn't be biased.<br /><br />Wasn't impressed... I almost walked out of this movie (and probly would've if it had been 30min longer) which NEVER happens with me... the concept was there, but not executed very well.<br /><br />The stripper routines were supposed to be 'sexy', but they just bored me... during one I was thinking \\"couldn't you come up with something else?\\"... the plot was interesting slightly but not very good, and I didn't buy the \\"love interest\\" angle between channing's character and the lead girl (can't remember her name).<br /><br />At points in the movie, I was bored and checked my watch...<br /><br />All in all, just not a very good movie... yes, the guys were cute but that's not enough to hold my attention<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend this one, but you may like it more than I did *shrugs*
0525953728|2.0|I picked up the book a little before starting to read Black Banners (another book written by an intelligence operative in the FBI, Ali Soufan), and I found that there is very little worth reading in No Easy Day. As much as Mark Owens may be an accomplished operator within the Navy SEALs, it becomes clear very quickly that he is no writer. With themes as naive as \\"Never make the same mistake twice\\" and the blatantly obvious avoidance of contractions within quotes, No Easy Day comes to light as a nonfiction written by a man with no other purpose than to tell the story himself. There is no new information that comes to light on the most captivating operation of the novel, and other than that Mark Owens seems to ramble on about how SEAL team operatives fight against America's enemies and how partisan politicians actually are.<br /><br />I'm not going to recommend this book to any one interested in becoming more acquainted with the War in Iraq or to better understand Al Qaeda, but in a historical sense No Easy Day offers a unique perspective on the events that transpired in UBL's final moments.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I am a fan, but this book was just OK. Most of these books require suspension of disbelief. I can accept that in a plot. But this one was improbable and kind of dull. I had a \\"have I not read this before?\\" feeling throughout the book. Almost every writer eventually taps out a series like this. Is Reacher overreaching? Is the author starting to type rather than write? Interested to see the next book
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My family loved it. I would watch again. Very great movie for children and adults. If you are looking for a great family movie this is a great one.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|When I am in the mood to see Gerard Butler,I watch this movie. I wish I owned it but can't afford it.  I think this was one of his best movies.  The quality of the picture is generally good.  I just like switching to Amazon every once in a while because I like the qualify of their movies.  Phantom of the Opera is one of the top love stories.  I feel so sorry for him at the end.  At least he had a few precious moments with Christina.  And he isn't a professional singer.  He pulled this one off quite well.  I will always watch the Phantom.  And I always cry.  I have watched this movie more than ten times.  I love it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Premise sounds dull as dirt.  For $17 for a computer/Kindle file??? No thanks; I'll wait until I can gete a used one for a buck ninety-five.  Rowling is NOT God, even though the kiddies seem to think so.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I don't want to give away the story for those who wish to read this. I read it for book club and it did generate some discussion, but all of us came away with a different understanding of the story. I can say that there really is not much of an ending and the ending provided is unbelievable given the lack of tangible evidence. Blood on the shorts after supposedly breaking a neck? Throwing in the bit about the found dog seemed too convenient when there wasn't much else to support a truly violent tendency. The parts about growing up and rough play seemed like typical boy stuff to me. The author relies too much on congecture and the book remains unconvincing. I was disappointed.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is awesome because I get to play people I don't know and get to play with my friends.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i think this app is for 8 to100 year olds i think it is a time waster if you like fun games than this is the game for you it is fun when you get extra coins and special coins u also get prizes and theres also also all kinds of puzzles and you collect puzzle pieses to finish a puzzle im still on the first puzzle the prizes i go is a flamigo i recommend this game to all ages it takes a long time to get coins though
B0090P98Z4|5.0|its all in the title.  extra words so I can post the review.  just a few more words ... fried pickle.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I never buy music without hearing it first but I took a chance and just bought it.<br />All I can say it is one of his best ever.<br />I recommend if you like Bob  Dylan you need to own this CD.<br />My wife hates it,I love it. A glass of wine and a nice cigar goes good with this CDV.
B008KEOEKA|2.0|Why Iva, why????<br /><br />After all the complaints from around the world about the \\"loudness wars\\", including derision from luminaries such as Bob Dylan and you go and jump on the bandwagon and do it to your own back catalogue. They sounded just fine with the 2001 remasters. I bought this with trepidation only to have my doubts confirmed when the first chords of Crazy came CRASHING through my speakers....and on it went for the whole album!!<br />I am going to buy a second hand copy of this from the remasters circa 2001 and hear this fabulous work the way it should be heard - with DIFFERENT harmonics, not ONE LOUD NOISE.<br /><br />Avoid!!!
B007R41E8O|4.0|This was a fun game, lots of challenges and puzzles. I like that it has a hint feature, and in some of the puzzles it allowed you to skip it if you did not solve it in time.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|I always have loved Sonic the Hedgehog&trade;!Super classic!So when I saw Sonic the Hedgehog&trade; Episode 1 &amp; 2 and Sonic&trade; CD,I'm like,&quot;Woah!I gotta get this NOW!&quot;.Awesome gameplay,average controls,and killer bosses!Just like the olden days!
0316228532|3.0|i actually only paid $10 for this book, because i got 15 dollars today for doing a survey at the mall, therefore i don't feel like i lost too much money. This book is weird, i would have rather seen Rowling do a book about Draco Malfoy and his family, that would have been much better
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game its very interactive and fun. I would definitely recommend. this game to others! Allows you to really enjoy the many facets of this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this game can keep the kids entertained for hours. I also like to play during down time at work. Hours of fun!!!!  Recommend for everyone!!!
B002ZG98FU|3.0|To begin with, I'll state that I really enjoyed this movie, but it is not among the better movies I've seen. This is one of those comedies that hypes itself with legendary stars - who, unfortunately, are slightly past their prime.  The original previews showcase the pairing of two legends; Harrison Ford & Diane Keaton. However, the thrust of the movie is from a manicly brilliant performance by Rachel McAdams as the producer of a morning tv show. McAdams carries the movie with her frantic management, overcoming each bump and hurdle of her life to keep the tv show running smoothly. Ford & Keaton play the lead on-air personalities... but the movie is mostly about McAdams' character. And while Keaton's performance is worthy of her adorable appeal, Ford seems tired, and is merely going through the motions. The movie does have its moments of \\"Oooos\\" & \\"Awwws\\"... some good bits that tickle your funny bone. It's not a memorable comedy... the kind that becomes a classic... but it is good entertainment, a nice story, well worth a repeated viewing.
B001NB3IJU|1.0|Plain and simple to the point, this is by far the worst Who album ever made. Listened to it again recently and it still stinks, did not improve with age at all.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|This is a rarity for me - the second half of the book I found myself fast reading it, a line here, a paragraph there, advancing almost as quickly as the Kindle would allow me. And not because the book was so greatly written, but because I wanted it to end, and I still wanted to find out if somehow it would turn out to be as great as the reviews here promised.<br /><br />The first half of the book - there was suspense there, but it seemed mechanical. Things we have already encountered in other books and movies. And the characters, especially the main one, were neither likeable nor interesting.<br /><br />Even though I'm sorry I bothered with this book, I'm giving it two stars and not just one because I liked the ending.
B000FC10MU|5.0|The first three times I read Neil Gaiman's \\"American Gods,\\" I kept thinking how much it didn't read like his kind of work (I was used to his happier, wittier, fairy tale type books).  This fourth time through, after having read more of his other works and more of the afterwords he's put them, I realized that it really does read like him:  his milieu is \\"fairy tales\\" AND myth.  This book falls smack in the middle of myth.  Also, a lot of his work is dark, and this book is dark.  There does seem to be a slight difference in tone, though.  \\"American Gods\\" lacks almost all of the witticisms present in his other works and, somehow, it feels more \\"real\\" (probably because he invented only the characters and seems to have tried to keep the settings true(ish) to life). It's a very well-written, well-characterized, well-described dark book.  I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.
B005K17RU0|4.0|If it wouldn't just disappear off my screen I'd give five stars! But it doesn't force close and freeze like some other weather apps I had prior to this one. It is still in my menu just sometimes goes off the home screen. Not that big of a deal.
B008AWBQGW|3.0|not same LS....but good. most of the songs i really liked. guess it is hard to really be excited, when early work was the best.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Everything was great except for ending. Very suductive and sexy but written as a woman would not graphic like porn.
B001HN6918|5.0|All I can say is that my grandkids, who live in Israel and NEVER heard of Kung Fu Panda LOOOOVVVVVVEEEEE it. Ages are 13, 8, 4. Each one asks to see it over and over again.  I will have to buy them number 2. Universal themes work.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Angry Birds is hard to put down once you start playing, I just have to kill those pigs. Some levels are easy and some take some strategy. Great game, much better without the ads.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book into understanding the lives of the SEALs and their passion to protect our country no matter what. I have always been a great admirer of the TEAMs and this book outlines a better picture of their lives and what goes through their minds as they go into and perform extremely dangerous missions in the name of this great country of ours. GOD bless these men and women and all of our military personel. We could all take a page of their discipline and dedication into our daily lives.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Entertaining storytelling, as always. Reacher continues to be one of my favorite fictional characters; Lee Child rarely, if ever, disappoints.
0385344333|4.0|A Wanted Man is the new installment in the Jack Reacher saga.  Jack is on the road again, in hardscrabble parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri.  En route to Virginia, he hitches a ride and finds himself in a car with two men and a woman.  The woman is twitchy and nervous.  The men seem self-assured, perhaps even a little arrogant.<br /><br />What Jack has not yet learned is that a murder has occurred in Nebraska.  What he will come to learn is that the two men in the car with him were probably involved, though many things remain unresolved--the identity of the victim, the identity of the two men, their position (bright side/dark side) vis `a vis the law and the identity of the woman.<br /><br />Jack must escape from the two men and then pursue his own investigation in tandem with a local FBI agent.  Something `big' is involved because the area is quickly populated with agents from the Bureau, the CIA, Homeland Security, et al.<br /><br />The novel is not as claustrophobic as it sounds (or as it might have been).  The suspense occurs in Jack's mind as he sifts through verbal and physical evidence without disclosing the fact that he is doing so.  Eventually we leave the constrained spaces of the first and succeeding cars and get out into open territory, with a large number of villains ensconced in a very interesting facility.  It's Jack against the world but we all know that he prefers it that way.<br /><br />On balance--a solid outing.  Not the best of the Reacher novels, but up to Lee Child's normal standard.  Most of his readers will enjoy it but I suspect that most of his readers will also be ready for something a little different in the next novel--a fresh setting, some interesting Reacher backstory, a little love interest, a less conventional plot, etc.<br /><br />As we say on the students' papers--a high B+.
1609611543|3.0|This book throws out everything I knew about whole wheat products being a good heart friendly food. After reading this book I have been undecided on what to eat now for my own heart and diabetes issues. The book certainly points out a new direction - one that is difficult to follow in our culture. Almost everything I eat has been based on wheat products from breakfast to lunch to dinner - the choices  are now not so simple. I am sure that the book has a lot of truth - but it is hard and difficult advice to follow completely .<br /><br />This book will wake you up and get you to thinking about your diet. THERE IS A VERY STRONG MESSAGE INSIDE THIS BOOK! I am not so sure that everyone is ready to follow its recommendations.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I like this game especially since its free. the handling can be a little difficult at times but it is a decent way to pass some free time
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a fabulous series.  Couldn't stop watching it!  Maggie Smith is terrific as the Upper Class Aristocratic Grand Dame of the family. Can't wait for Season 3!!
B000002L9Y|4.0|Christine McVie is the best thing about Fleetwood Mac!<br /><br />There, I said it, and if ever an album proved it, Tango does. She blows away everybody else's tunes with her tours de force, Everywhere and Little Lies. I hadn't heard this album since it came out, and recently a fellow guitarist lent me the entire Mac catalog. After marveling as always at Peter Green's gorgeous tone and exceptionally musical blues playing, which never gets old, I moved along to the Buckingham/Nicks period. Rumors is just crazy good, as it was the day it came out and still will be in fifty years. Great melodies are great melodies and that album is chock full of them. But it wasn't until Tango, over a decade later, that they truly grabbed the musical gold ring again.<br /><br />Tusk was a weak follow-up to perfection, at best, and Mirage has only one truly memorable tune to my ears. So by the mid-'80s, after Nicks' solo career got going, most of us who were awed by Rumors had given up on a real sequel. Then Big Love came out, and while it's a fine song, it doesn't have that epic melodic and harmonic sweep of the best Mac tunes. Then we heard Everywhere.<br /><br />I just started listening to it again last week, and I haven't had a tune become an earworm again that fast in years. I can't stop playing it; the gorgeous singing rings tightly around those melodies as that perfect muted guitar riff sets it all off, while Mick plays a straight four with his trademark little fills that move everything along so well. Nicks does what she does best---perfect high swooping harmonies---and Christine delivers a truly sweet vocal. I've always loved her voice the most of the three; Songbird anyone?<br /><br />And no doubt about it, Lindsey's production polished this gem to sparkling brilliance. A truly great pop tune deserves extra attention, and to my mind overproduction only occurs when the melody takes second seat to the sound, which LB avoids beautifully here and throughout the album. Sometimes I could live without the little vocal break coda, which sounds kind of Enya-ish, never a bad thing, but is just filler here. Still, I could see the Beatles doing this tune and it fitting perfectly with their canon, and you sure can't say that about very many songs written in the last 40 years.<br /><br />Little Lies has almost all of the same attributes, with a somewhat less stellar melody, but even better chorus singing by Nicks and LB. Hooks like that are any band's dream, and two on one album is a real score.<br /><br />Other than those two tunes and Big Love, only Sara really moves me much, even with the pills really starting to show up in Nicks' slurred phrasings and bits of flat pitch. And it's always nice to hear Stevie singing about anything other than how much she misses Lindsey and how she'll never forget or get over their Ultimate Moments. God knows he got tired of hearing about it, as he reminded her and us in so many tunes, perhaps best in Tusk's What Makes You Think You're The One? And having just listened to their catalog, it sure does get old hearing her moan about missing him over and over and over, even 30 years later, so you can only guess how much it drove him nuts.<br /><br />But everyone always talks about Buck/Nicks when they mention Mac, and Christine gets short shrift. I say we rethink that and make her the real star! Her songs of love are pure and unalloyed, not covered with the patina of yesterday's glories like Nicks', or tinged with LB's mild confusion. She just keeps on forgiving and moving on towards new hope, and how can you not love that?<br /><br />Wrap that feeling in a melody like Everywhere and you've got one of the best soaring pop singles of the '80s. It clearly should have been the lead single, but apparently Lindsey's ego couldn't have that; he and Stevie always thought they were the Mac, but in the end it's really Mick's and John's band, and time has shown that it's Christine's wonderfully kind and extremely musical feel thatlifted this band into its greatest moments of musical joy.<br /><br />Maybe they've got one more serious jewel left in them...?<br />If so, my money's on it coming from Christine.lifted this band into its greatest moments of musical joy.<br /><br />Maybe they've got one more serious jewel left in them...?<br />If so, my money's on it coming from Christine.

B008RV5K5E|5.0|I expected this movie to be good but it was amazing!!!..an excellent addition to the Batman films it exceeded my expectations. A must have for fans.  I am quite worried about the actor portraying the Joker in part 2 ...I miss Mark Hammil but hopefully this guy will bring something to the table. Part one however is amazing & definitely worth getting on blu-ray... hope to see a killing joke & a death in the family film soon!!! with Mark Hammil!!!

B005PKLKS6|5.0|One of the best things I have ever seen actually gave me the chills. Best show on television nothing better
B007FEFLTO|5.0|There are reasons why Ken Follett is one of my favorites, if not THE favorites and Winter of the World is another shining example of why.<br /><br />WOW picks up ten years after the end of Fall of Giants.  While it does have the original cast from the previous installment, it's more about the second generation: their children.  It spans the time from the rise of Hitler and his Nazi regime, through the Spanish Revolution, WWII, Pearl Harbor, the advent of the nuclear bomb, the subsequent bombing of Japan and ends in the 50s.<br /><br />While its well researched and equally well told, it wouldn't be anything more than a history book if it weren't for a diverse and nicely constructed cast.  Winter of the World has that in spades.  While putting his characters through all kinds of world changing and hellish scenarios, Follett never diverges away from interpersonal drama, relationships and subplots.  What he puts his characters through runs the gamut from the uplifting to the downright terrifying.  Loves are won and lost, families are born, battles are fought, atrocities are lived through and overcome.  Each and every character is well fleshed out and reacts logically.  Using a combination of personal motives and moral codes, Follett's characters react to the real world and historical events he's made them a part of in a believable and logical way.  They react to what's going on around them and make their decisions based on their beliefs and the state of the world around them.  Nobody puts fictional characters into true events like Ken Follett.  *As an aside, my favorite characters and story lines center around Lloyd, Carla, Woody and Daisy.*<br /><br />It's an amazing accomplishment that, for the second time, he's interspersed the real and the fictional into such a broad sweeping and well written work.  I don't know how he does it but he does.<br /><br />I've read many of the previous reviews and see the low average rating.  As it turns out, many of the one and two starreviews are from people complaining about the price...even BEFORE the book was released.  Rating a book solely based on the price before ever even reading it is, in my humble opinion, silly, uninformative and unfair to the author.  If it's too costly, go to a library.  If if wasn't to your liking AFTER having read it, then base the review on that.  Complaining about price is a waste of everybody's time.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />Winter Of The World is a fine example of why I love Ken Follett's books and, more importantly, why I love to read.  You just can't help but get swept up in the characters and the time periods he writes about.  Fantastic.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK. I loved it. I am amazed, I am in awe, and I was so moved by Slammed. I was just floored by Will's maturity, his strength, his focus, his heart and everything about him. He just wowed me.  It took Layken a little while to get it, but she did and I was rooting for them the entire time. I would like to write something beautiful, a review that would adequately express my enjoyment. But words fail me right now, so I will have to settle for I loved this book.<br /><br />Thank you to Netgalley and publisher for the complimentary copy of this book.

B008I3QZKU|1.0|I'm a huge Killers supporter and been a fan since 2005, but this album is awful. Just about every song seems forced and there's just a lack of creativity. Gone are the glory days of Sam's Town and Hot Fuss, in which the best eras took place. If you love Brandon Flowers and don't care to hear the drums, or the guitars, then this album is for you. The band uses brandon's voice to drive the songs, and rarely if ever is there a guitar solo or even a cool baseline. It's like a desert(maybe this is the desert brandon is reffering to in songs) for those things and when there is a bit of guitar or drums it just seems a cluttered mess. It's a huge mistake to to rely purely on brandon's voice and his lyrics, because it makes the album one dimensional. When Brandon isn't up to par, the whole song collapses on it's self and has no chance. Brandon has a great voice, but he doesn't use it in the smartest of ways. He often makes the song cluttered and exhausting. You can tell they tried really hard, and in fact probably too hard. The good songs are just not there ,and the highlights are few and far between. The best song is Runaways, but that song isn't anything to write home about. The lyrics aren't vague enough to leave to your own imagination and are too literal. Pretty much all the songs are about love and fading love. Flesh and Bone is another highlight, along with Heart of a Girl, and From Here on Out. If you hate ballads then stay away from this album, as most of these songs are ballads. If you are thinking they might be as good as the ballad,\\"My List\\" you are wrong! If you liked the awful album Day & Age, then there's a good chance you will like Battle Born. Also the title track Battle Born tries to be a rock song,but fails miserabley.It's such a boring and forced mess. These aren't your brothers killers!
B004GTLFNW|5.0|besides reading most of the websites related to fitness and weight loss, I also read few books purchased from Amazon, I already reached the diet that works for me, and have a fitness club superscription ongoing (which unfortunately can't end till another year ).<br /><br />I have read the whole book in few hours, and the good things I can say about it are:<br /><br />- It is realistic, practical and doable, furthermore it gives a guideline on how to manipulate an exercise difficulty, and workout difficulty.<br />- The way the author talks (writes) is very affective and motivating, I liked it.<br />- There are many exercises in this book (104), and also ready programs for all fitness levels (4) and it helps you decide what fitness level you have easily in order to know where to start.<br />- The way he approaches food and diet is simple and clear, yet he puts clear and simple steps on what is the right diet program, he didn't come with something new than what is written in many websites, he just put it in one place and in a simple way.<br /><br />I always believed that it is possible to have good fitness level without using any equipment, but didn't find enough information on the internet, this book put them all together, I did only the first day of the program so far, I might update the review with more details later.

B003G88WTO|4.0|I had heard about caribou in the past and some freinds of mine told me that he was a good artist, but i never got around to cheacking him out. I was surfing through the music store at Amazon.com and the album \\"Swim\\" was on my reconmendations list. Being curious i sampled a few songs. after a few minutes of listning, i found myself drawn to the solid beats and groving to the almost hypnotic sounds that were being generated. Considering it was only 5$ at the time, i of course bought it. With a talent at creating mezmerizing sounds and a flow of variaty, Caribou has done the music world a favor and makes an origanel CD few seem to appriciate these day's. While im not a fan of a couple of song's on there {Kaili and leave house} the others show a good foundation. All in all, If you are a techno/Indie Rock fan like me, I would deffinatly give it a shot at least once.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always liked this game and love this version. I enjoy that when you are out of moves it will reshuffling. the one thing I don't like is the advertising.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Fun game. Graphics are not the best in the world, still there not the worst either. So far so good. Will continue to play game.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I cannot actually review it because the game won't download .It won't even come up.I am a huge Angry birds fan and its very dissappointing!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The most relevant information I've ever seen offered in a battery usage app, presented with the most rewarding and impressive graphics!<br />It even breaks down forecasts based on ultra specific tasks and situations, like whether on wifi or not, using camera or video, etc.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good game. But I agree with everyone else..there should be a better way to get more coins. You have to either purchase them or wait a very long time to build them up. Also most of the prizes fall over the edge... Coin pirates is MUCH better!
160094048X|5.0|I have been vegan for quite some time (about a decade), and I consider myself to be a vegan food connoisseur. For some reason though, I've always had issues with cookies. I've tried many recipes I'd found online and failed every time. Whenever I'd travel I would read labels on cookies, cookie mixes, refrigerated-just-bake concoctions, you name it, just to find a good vegan cookie, and I could never find one. Then, I learned I was gluten sensitive, and I thought it was hopeless because what were the odds (LOL, seems a little melodramatic--cue the violin please!). One day, I met some lovely ladies in a vegan spot I frequent and told them about my struggle, and they recommended Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar. I ordered it online as soon as I got back to my car! (It took like 8 days to arrive via the US postal service! I just knew they'd brought back the donkey express service, it seemed so slow. I was so anxious!) As soon as I got the book I made chocolate chip cookies. The best EVER! I didn't use all the various flours mentioned, and they still came out perfect! I made them 3 times in 5 days because my brothers and me loved them so. So I rate this book highly. The cookies were great every time and I look forward to making more. The book is adorable and sturdy and some of the recipes are ambitious (There is a recipe for my favorite Girl Scout cookie...oh she went there!)So, yeah...I have only used one recipe, but it's because it was sooo good I got stuck at the first one. It goes down as a bad mamma-jamma in my book...fine as it can be, lol.<br /><br />Peace y'all! Be merry.

B004AW64CM|3.0|I love this movie but being in a rush I clicked on the sing-a-long version instead of the regular version for automatic streaming.

B007WFTFG6|4.0|I got this to do with my 4year old grandson. I like it. Its a little hard for him to stay inside the lines but he enjoyed it; me to because it was raining out side. We both had fun with it. Liked the big pictures of animals. Another pluses was that I got it for free from amazon.com. A good comp. To get books from of all kinds.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|32 Years ago a freind and I went into our main City (Auckland, New Zealand) to listen to the new Live release from Supertramp. It was a promotion by one of our Record Stores (known back then as \\"The Record Warehouse\\"). The deal was the album was played live on a huge sound system in our main Central Square (from memory a couple of thousand of people turned up). It was at night, no visuals just listening to the entire album. If you liked it you could walk back up the road to the Record Store and buy it for a special one off price ($12.99 fom memory). We listened, we loved it, we went back and bought it.<br /><br />32 years later along comes the DVD (which was recorded at the same venue as the album, just a couple of days later).<br /><br />I have just finished watching it last night, and all I can say is.... FANTASTIC. These guys were brilliant, fantastic musicians and composers...from 1974 to 1979, four great albums, what a show and fantastic set list to close out 1979.<br /><br />If you like Supertramp and / or enjoy great music with great melodies and vocals played by great musicians this is a 100% no risc disc.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this, if it sounds remotely like you I think you'd enjoy it too.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|I must confess to being a lifelong Bob Dylan fan, so some may consider this review stilted. I bought \\"Freewheelin'\\" in 1964 and haven't looked back. That being said, I am truly awestruck at the emotional reactions this album conveys. While not as world shaking as say, \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", \\"Tempest\\" instead delves so deep into our emotional psyche as to be at times almost scary. Case in point: I had listened to the record once through when my wife came home from work and we gave it a second spin. The title track had just completed and I looked over at her to see her crying her eyes out. Yep, it is that powerful.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this record is filled with dark stories of death, murder, power and lust, hate and revenge. It will make you face your mortality square on while laughing out the side of your mouth. Dylan's sly humor infuses the record. These are timeless themes of human feelings recounted by our greatest storyteller wrapped in the music of our land throughout the history we know and a lot we don't.<br /><br />I'm not going to give a song for song account. That's best left for the listener's own interpretation. I will say this. Every song save one is a powerhouse of Dylan at his best. I found 'Roll on John\\" a poor fit for the other, more intense storytelling contained in the record.<br /><br />One other point. Although I did download the album to get a first listen, do yourself a favor and buy the LP package. If you don't own a turntable, beg, borrow or steal one. The difference in sound is astounding to the point of cheating yourself by listening to the album on cd or by downloading.<br /><br />Old fan or newcomer to Dylan should love this record. Those of us who find his work without peer will treasure it. This Tempest blows wild and free. We continue to see nothing like him yet.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I've wanted a nice but not excessively expensive watch for some time to replace my older Citizen Star & Stripes racing watch.<br />This is a beautiful watch with the two toned stainless, white on black face with yellow chrono hands.<br />The sapphire crystal was the clincher.<br />I've had many compliments on it.<br />Definitely recommended.
B008XFB86Y|5.0|Fantastic use of violence in the face of hopeless odds.  Makes efficient use of violence to propel the very simple story.  Also another nice introduction to western audiences, of Indonesian forms of the arts of Mars, and of the Merantau concept.
B009HNDHFQ|5.0|I am so happy that we are entering a new season and by the end of the season premier, it looks to be a good one. After the 100TH episode with The Reaper, it has been a bit downhill and anti-climatic. The Unsubs rarely last more than an episode and just have not been quite as interesting as before. I know with changes in characters, who's leaving?, who's coming back? that may have impacted the writing. The addition of Jeanne Tripplehorn does not fit in as of yet. Reading comments on other sites, many are in agreement. I do not get, or welcome her character's impact on the show. We already have The Smart One, and though he is brilliant, he is more than likable. The new co-star comes across as \\"bitchy\\", we already have that with Strauss. Jeanne Tripplehorn has seen better days, so why would they attempt to replace the irreplaceable with her? Prentiss taking over Elle went smoothly. Agent Rossi fit right in. She does not. It doesn't seem that the shows returning characters accept or like her, how can we? Other than that, the creepy part at the end of this episode promises a great season and I am looking forward to it. If something happens to the new agent and she no longer comes back, I would not be saddened.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|I got this originally as a Free App of the day.  I've been playinv off an on since then.  First: you DO NOT have to buy anything to win.  In fact, I have bought nothing, and have beaten all levels and have only one upgrade left.  Sure, there is in app purchasing, but it is inconsequential and never nagging.  It just makes the game quicker (and I'm my opinion, less enjoyable to do so).<br />Graphics are very nice, and there is an HD option that improves them (I prefer non-HD).  Everything is easily recognized.<br />Gameplay is smooth, never stutters on my Epic 4G touch.<br />Challenge: moderate to hard, but you can play 'endless mode' side missions to upgrade (which is necessary if you don't purchase).  I enjoy the variety of weapons and upgrade options that are nonlinear.  Overall, i rate this up there with plants and zombies for time invested and fun.  Well worth a few bucks of game play!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it work great. I use it so much tells you how long you you have till the battery runs out
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Author E.L. James does an admirable job of 'tying up' the story line associated with the 'Fifty Shades' trilogy.<br /><br />'Freed', the third book in the saga of Christian and Ana finds the characters continuing their sexual power exchange - now as a newly married couple - while confronting issues and circumstances from the past; chief among them - abandonment, possession, unrequited love (different [e.g. kinkier] than D.H. Lawrence themes) and jealousy.<br /><br />These are also recurrent in book two and particularly relevant in the trilogy as resolution is sought and gained. What separates 'Freed' from books one and two is the further character development of its principals, both protagonist and antagonist and those surrounding them.<br /><br />This is a fitting conclusion to a publishing enterprise that has elevated BDSM to a higher level of literary consciousness.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|OMG! I really like this app, it saves my kindle so much power and saves me time waiting for the thing to charge

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the whole Hunger Games series.  I was disappointed that it had to end!!  It was a page turner right up the the end!
0307594165|4.0|As a writer, I start each book by Toni Morrison with great anticipation, knowing she will show me some innovative new way to write, particularly when it comes to viewpoint.  JAZZ was my first Toni book and is still my favorite.  Written in first person I kept wondering: who is \\"I\\"?  A character obviously close to the story's characters.  About three-fourths of the way through the book, I got it:  \\"I\\" was Toni, the author herself.<br /><br />In HOME, interspersed between chapters written in third person (the author describing the scenes and the characters) are short chapters in italics written in first person from the main character, Frank Money, to the author - telling her the truth about things.  Often in writing a story a character \\"takes over\\" and this is a delightful way of showing this.<br /><br />What didn't work as well for me was when Toni switched from telling the story from Frank's point of view, to three-fourth of the way in, to his little sister's.  And earlier, to that of Frank's girlfriend.  I would have liked more from each of them, because I always feel her female characters are always more convincing.<br /><br />Her descriptions of life for blacks in the 50s offered a strange mixture of nostalgia and horror.  And she never mentions whether a character is black or white, so we can only guess and assume that the bad guys, like the evil doctor, are white.<br /><br />Because of these concerns, I wouldn't rate Home as one of her best books, but I'd take a book by Toni Morrison over any other book any day.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The app freezes up and crashes more often than I'd like but otherwise the app is great. Sometimes it cannot retrieve the original webpage. love the search categories, easy navigation, ease of repinning, and it is constantly refreshing to fetch more pins.

1416550550|5.0|I really enjoyed how creative this story was. It is a little hard to follow at first, due to switching back and forth between time periods, but worth the read. I thought the characters were well developed, and the author did a great job of describing all of the settings and landscapes. I'm looking forward to reading more of Kate Morton's books!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Throwing in my two cents as one of the few people on the planet who hasn't read the HP series. (My kids were the perfect age as the books came out: young enough to love them, old enough to read for themselves.) I pre-ordered THE CASUAL VACANCY and inhaled it the minute it hit my Kindle mainly (I will admit) because it's a remarkable moment of publishing history, but I was quickly drawn into the story. The characters are people I already know, because they are the people we all already know. In the end, I liked this book on its own merits. And I liked it a lot.<br /><br />Rowling is a terrifically strong writer; you can't fault her on craft, and I like that she doesn't feel the need to do any acrobatics or post a billboard - THIS WAY TO THE BRILLIANT WRITER - on every page, as is the irritating case in a lot of literary fiction. If you're able to set aside the JK ROWLING of it all, you'll love or hate this book on the strength of what it says about people. Folks. Relationships that are the opposite of magic. Politics that are petty. The youthful compulsion to crusade - at any age - and the crusty compulsion to squash the crusading of others.<br /><br />Early on, it's noted that Samantha \\"enjoyed [Miles'] pomposity with precisely the same spirit as she liked, on formal occasions, to wear a hat,\\" and Rowling is able to enjoy the faults of these characters the same way. These are the characters Franzen would write if he had more tenderness and less literary dyspepsia. Observations about resonant, everyday dynamics - conversational currency, backhanded charity, the lie of self-sacrifice - are made with more wry than sly and not a whiff of self-righteousness.<br /><br />This is a quiet book; some will say cozy, but I think there's enough edge to prevent that. I loved the dry Britcom humor. A thousand little understated zingers make THE CASUAL VACANCY a pleasure to read in the way that the [[ASIN:B008PAG0BU Mapp and Lucia]] books are a pleasure. As life unravels for the people of Pagford, we have a goldfish bowl view, but that understated tone keeps things from going totally soapy.<br /><br />A book that kept coming back to me as I read was Joseph Heller's [[ASIN:0684841215 Something Happened]]. I can't think of another instance where an author from whom so much was expected took on the profoundly risky task of reminding us that there is nothing more human than the mundane.ople of Pagford, we have a goldfish bowl view, but that understated tone keeps things from going totally soapy.<br /><br />A book that kept coming back to me as I read was Joseph Heller's [[ASIN:0684841215 Something Happened]].

0345528581|5.0|Over the past four years, I've become very interested in \\"self-sufficient\\" fitness (i.e. no gym or equipment necessary).  I look back on my numerous purchases (many by John Peterson, Charles Atlas, Mark Delisle, Convict Conditioning I and II, Naked Warrior, Matt Furey) and I can firmly assert that this is my favorite of the bunch.<br /><br />I - the background stories of his SEAL days makes for a fun and intersting read.<br />II - the nutrition section, while brief, is very effective.  It's actually not that hard to focus your diet on meat, fish, fowel, eggs, fruits, veggies, nuts and seeds. While he doesn't push \\"paleo\\" he's clear that these items should be the focus of your diet.<br />III - an extensive amount of exercises that need no equipment<br />IV - great programming to work the exercises into meaningful routines that take you from basic to way beyond what a mere mortal (i.e. non-Navy SEAL) could likely accomplish.  I will say that some of his modalities take a little gettig used to and are difficult to do properly at first (tabatas, ladders, pyramids, etc.)<br />V - he's got a great app for android and apple<br />VI - he's got an active forum where other users of these methods help each other (and yes, Mark actually posts there).<br /><br />This book is one stop shopping and helps with all aspects of fitness.

B00110K62U|5.0|As an avid and loyal fan to Les Miserables (book and musical), especially the 10th Anniversary musical, I was extremely worried after reading all the negative reviews.<br />However, I received my copy today, and watched it with my family (who are also huge fans), and I can say that the quality was great and the left out scene of Gavroche's \\"Little People\\" has been put back in.<br />However, my only problem with it was the audio. I was pleased with most of the songs, however, the audio leaves much to be desired for some certain songs. Most of the solos are perfectly fine. It is mostly during the trios, quartets, etc. that you can hear the difference. Since one of my favorite songs is \\"One Day More\\", I was upset when I couldn't hear some parts, including Marius', very well. And since I know it could be better (listened to it over a thousand times on Youtube), I was quite disappointed with the audio.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the overall quality was fabulous, and I cannot wait to watch the 2nd disc \\"The Making of Les Miserables\\"!

0547564651|4.0|I really like this book.<br /><br />Tough dug into real issues, talked to experts and explored their research, asking deep questions.<br /><br />Some of his conclusions were more feel good than fully explored, but that was rare!  I learned so much about success and raising children.  While I don't agree with everything realize that his research and sources are innovating in a developing field thus are still learning themselves.  And his sources are both super smart and very committed thus even when they haven't fully come up with a final answer they lead you to follow the direction their research is going.<br /><br />One profound conclusion Tough makes (because I believe it myself) is that parents in the better schools are often setting their kids on a safe path but one that doesn't encourage innovation or risk.  Yes!  And so few writers are willing to point that out...and it limits the options long term for these \\"safe\\" kids who are facing a more rapidly evolving and more competitive world.<br /><br />Why four star and not five?  I didn't always agree with the conclusions Tough makes from his research.  But you should still buy the book and read every page!  I'm just pointing out that it isn't all fact and readers should question his conclusions.  A lot of the research is too new or limited, but is heavily valuable as it's so important and ground breaking.  Readers just need to do an analysis as well, and judge for their own child or circumstances.  So, for example, I've read the Charles Murray book he references, and disagree with how he characterizes Murray's point (to support his thesis).  Murray does not claim that children who score poorly on standardized tests should not go to college.  Rather he points out our high college drop out rate, especially for children who enter college unprepared, and suggests being realistic about what our child can accomplish.  Not all will graduate (they don't).  He then points out the best plumber will earn more and be happierthan a mid range or less manager.  So ,know your child and push them in their best direction; they will feel like failures if you set them up for goals they can't accomplish.  Tough uses this Murray line in reference to a very determined young lady who does well her first year in college, despite her poor test score and scattered history...but only after she'd completed one year of college and didn't graduate!  So, yes, I totally agree that kids like her should be given all support and opportunities; she's working and fighting hard to succeed.  But, i think Murray would also agree and Tough mis-quotes him.  One person's opinion.<br /><br />Great book, even if not perfect.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Seriously funny stuff from a very intelligent but quirky woman. She can describe an everyday event in a way that not only lets you relate it to your own life, but gives you another perspective - which only occurs to you when you are laughing out loud at her antics.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Like FROZEN PLANET,this is an excellent product from BBC. It's simply amazing, an absolute pleasure to watch. The presentation, the case where the dvds are placed, are quite nice, everything in very good taste and quality. Something to remark especially is the definition of the images and the quality of the sound. Narrated by David Attemborough, it is always a pleasure to listen to,the same as the excellent music by George Fenton. And what you see and the way they worked to film the scenes is something certainly outstanding. Anything I can tell you will always be surpassed by having the experience of watching it. And you will want to watch it over and over again and through the years. No wonder why the NEW YORK TIMES said it is a masterpiece and the CHICAGO TRIBUNE said it was the best dvd of the year and an extraordinary achievement.<br />PLANET EARTH THE COMPLETE BBC SERIES
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I do not read horror novels.  My life is scary enough as it is!  However, I was encouraged by friends to read \\"11-22-63\\" because of King's treatment of time travel.<br />What a great read!  Oddly, knowing that the hero of the story could not possibly succeed--because the date of November 22, 1963, IS history, after all--distracted me not a bit from a suspension of disbelief.  Yes, there were horrific parts (the author is who he is), but the perfect and uplifting conclusion made reading the chilling parts well worth it.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I have not finished the story, but it is because I seldom want to pick it up and read. Perhaps the protagonist will become less introspective and self demeaning as time goes by, but so far she seems to be the most worthy person in the story.  I have to remind myself that something more interesting may happen, but I have yet to feel anything but voyeuristic.

B00887490Y|5.0|This very good film shocked me as few others did since \\"Seven\\", surprised me as few others did since the \\"Usual suspects\\" and in a couple of scenes also scared me (although ultimately it was not half as scary as I expected).<br /><br />The story happens in Cold Rock, a little half-abandoned town in the state of Washington, where for the last couple of years somebody or SOMETHING abducted seventeen little children, babies or toddlers. There never was a viable suspect and no bodies were ever found. Terrified local residents nick named the person or THING behind those appearances \\"The Tall Man\\". A local nurse, Julia Dening, will finally become extremely concerned by the question \\"Who, or WHAT, is The Tall Man\\". A mute young girl, Jenny (Jodelle Ferland), who is the only one to really have seen \\"The Tall Man\\" with her own eyes, holds maybe some clues to solve the riddle...<br /><br />This is a very clever, very surprising thriller which manages to preserve the suspense for a very long time. I managed to understand what is going on a little bit earlier than it was openly revealed, but still, it was only 10 minutes before the end...<br /><br />Actors are doing great. Jessica Biel is here excellent and as always extremely beautiful. Joelle Ferland proves once again her great talent - she will be a great star one day! William B. Davis, the \\"Smoking Man\\" from X-Files, plays the role of the local old and slightly hapless sheriff - or is he really so hapless? Stephen McHattie, a Canadian veteran actor, does a great job as a tenacious detective, Lieutenant Dodd (he is mostly known from second roles, but his threatening face is rather unforgettable...). Last but not least, there is Colleen Wheeler, who plays Ms. Johnson, a local crazy woman - Ms Johnson is a secondary but important character and Colleen Wheeler played her perfectly.<br /><br />I would advise to NOT read more detailed reviews or even watch the trailers, so you can go see this film like I did, without knowing anything else other than what we can guess from the poster at the cinema entry. The surprises are important and the director did all he could to give us lots of false clues to prevent the secret of being found too early.<br /><br />Now, if what you need is a classical horror, here you risk to be a little bit disappointed, because this film is... well, something different. As father of little children myself I must say that I was quite troubled by the whole story and GREATLY shocked and upset by the solution. But I am not giving any more clues. Enjoy the film and decide yourself what you think of it.hing else other than what we can guess from the poster at the cinema entry.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|My wife happened to catch this (edited version)movie on a local broadcast TV station. She just couldn't stop talking about it and laughing out loud trying to describe it to me. I had to find out what all the hoopla was about, so I tracked down a copy on Amazon and purchased it. Guess what? She was right. I laughed my ass off. If you like wacky British humour (notice the British spelling) with a touch of \\"black\\" comedy thrown in for good measure, then this movie is for you.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I enjoyed the last Green Day. In fact its the first official record I bought from the band. Then I realized I only enjoyed three songs on it when it came down to it...this Cd I enjoy a few more. The first half of the album is solid. Classic. Then kill the dj is comical yet hard driven and catchy. I just fear the 3 records they put out will be worse and worse each release with uno having the hits.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|I had heard mediocre reviews of this movie, which again shows us not to worry about critics.  This movie was excellent - action packed, delicious! Top Notch action movie with top quality acting!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|I got this app as a FAOTD, and I've played through the all the built in levels.  The \\"one button\\" control has a reasonable level of sophistication, without requiring too much timing and coordination.  The built-in levels are of medium difficulty -- they require some thinking but are solvable.<br /><br />One interesting aspect that I have not explored deeply is the on-line portion.  It seems like there are 9000+ user-submitted levels to try, which is pretty overwhelming.  I played one and it seemed a bit more complex than the built-in level, but was solvable.  I attempted another, but I had to go before I could think through it.<br /><br />Overall, I think that this is a solid game for the built-in levels alone.  The online portion is a good bonus.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read the book quickly as you were anxious to find out what happened to his wife, but after completing the book, I realized I did not like any of the characters.  Hard to like a book in which none of the character are even remotely likable.  It did give you insight into many of today's marriage issues.  Do we only think about ourselves ... do we take the time to consider how our spouse might feel about our actions?  In that respect it was a good book.  I will say that all my friends loved the book!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|had fun playing this game cant wait for the next one.  wasn't over quick like some of the other games I have played
B009329Y30|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS THE BOMB!! IT MAKES  ME SMILE AND CRY BUT IN A FANTASTIC WAY!!!!!!! SOOOOOOO GOOOOOODDDDD YOU SHOULD BUY IT...............IT'S BETTER THEN RENTING TRUST MEEEEEEEEEEE
B000UIVRXG|5.0|We love this movie!! Great British humor. Could watch this movie over and over. Unique plot with a twist, highly recommend.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Now before we begin let me just say I'm a HUGE Green Day fan. I liked them before but I REALLY got into them during this Summer. I cranked up the radio whenever Oh Love played on the radio. So you can imagine my excitement when I heard that they were releasing 3 new albums in a series in the end of this year and next year and the first album called Uno! was being released on the same month of my birthday. Well let's just say I started telling all my friends how this album was going to be boss. Well I'm proud to say that my hype lived up because Green Day's Uno wins my Album Of The Year award. Every song on here is awesome on here and I'm glad that I own this album so I can tell my kids about this album when they're my age. I'm 13 BTW. So if you see this album buy it. 10/10 5/5 stars do whatever you can to get this album. And yes I will be getting Dos! but as a Christmas present. Alright peace.
B007TK77QE|1.0|With no competition from other book stores on the Kindle this is what happens: The Kindle book costs more than the hardback.<br />Guess we will see more of this as Amazon sells more and more ebooks.<br />A pity...
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I'm glad i'm done with it so I can focus again. This was the only book I read after watching the four movies. But I didn't feel I need to read the previous books first
B00422LESO|4.0|I read this on vacation. I liked it, it's a mindless read and is fun.  I'm surprised at the people who didn't like it.  If you want literature, this isn't it but if you want an escape...go for it!
B000FBJF3M|5.0|This book was fascinating from the first word.  How to build an aquaduct was never one of my prime learning goals but it never occurred to me how much scientific knowledge was needed for such an endeavor.  That such knowledge existed in those early A.D. years is astounding and the author makes every bit of learning a wow experience. At least for me. Sad that such a civilization should fall to greed and mismanagement. But then most civilizations seem to.
0439023521|3.0|I wanted to love \\"The Hunger Games,\\" but I liked it instead. It is a life-or-death plot--that's for sure, and Collins strives for drama and suspense by the overuse of sentence fragments. However, I am aware that she is aiming this novel at a younger audience, while I am a senior citizen!<br /><br />The storyline is brutal. It is about a teenager who is forced to compete in one-person-leaves-alive event. The main character, Katniss, survives through her skills and uses these same skills to feed her family. I won't spoil this novel by saying too much.<br /><br />Still, in spite of my minor criticisms, and a few letdowns, this is and interesting read. I tip my hat to Suzanne Collins--she engages her target audience, and that's what writing fiction is all about.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a girl so I love looking at fashion and hair.... they have a whole section for that.... they have probably 10 different sections... if not more ;)... but I like how you can create boards and repine all the things you like. and also can follow other people (and ,of course, they can follow you too) but all in all this is ky favorite app every downloaded... so get it and enjoy!  ( but you don't have to,lol)
B00571F26Y|2.0|The cell phone app isn't bad in the \\"doesn't work\\" sense, but I forgot that once an electronic book is on my phone, the only way to share the book would be to give up my phone for a few days.  (The kindle we have is currently tied into my wife's account and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get it to use both accounts.)  Not going to happen.<br /><br />So, - if you are downloading an e-book that you may want to share, put it on a real kindle, not on a cell phone with a kindle app.<br /><br />As for the book itself, he makes the point that the problem with being overweight is not sugar or sweets but the extra protein in hybrid wheat.  Since pre-hybrid wheat does not have the extra protein it does not appear to be as bad.  Then he repeats himself over and over and over.  Then when he finally decides to set up a diet he takes the traditional diet writers ploy of eliminating anything he can imagine that might put on a few ounces.  For massively overweight people this may be necessary.  I'm willing to find wheat substitutes, but cutting out all things made with sugar, all high sugar fruits and so on, amount to a major change in my diet that is a bit much.<br /><br />For myself, I will be trying to do the substitute and see if the research he quotes really works.  He mentions that there is a protein in hybrid wheat that specifically causes the so-called \\"beer belly\\" fat to accumulate.  Remove the protein and supposedly that will reverse itself.  Since I have only accumulated about 20-25 pounds in the 50 years since I graduated from college, I'm not looking for a massive weight loss but more of a targeted loss.<br /><br />I would rate the book higher if he limited the changes in diet to the subject that the book was supposed to address.  I hope it works.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|All time sci-fi favorite<br />Amust have for your collection<br />Not just special effects... But a great story which is not common nowadays
B008N5UX9M|2.0|I am a huge Maiden fan....<br />However, this is very uninspired. I expected alot more from Steve Harris. The basslines are very nice. There are a couple decent guitar riffs....but very \\"80's rehashed\\" sounding. The vocals are VERY uninspired. It just doesnt have the chemistry that I hear from Harris' work with Iron Maiden. Dont get me wrong, I wasnt expecting Iron Maiden. But I was expecting something energetic, from one of metals MOST energetic bass-beaters in history.<br />This doesnt work. Its doldrum. And unfortunate. Maybe next time?
0545425115|5.0|I'm sure everyone has their own opinion on this book (and the rest of the trilogy) and has given it quite forcibly, but I just had to throw my own 2 cents in. While I don't compare this book to the great literary classics, I do feel that this book captures something much more than you would imagine from a best-seller. It's creative in its retelling of the myths that it was drawn from. It's splendid in the characterization of a scared, yet admiringly brave not-girl,not-woman. I think that it goes beyond the mass market appeal, even if the mass market doesn't know why they're so drawn to it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very nice to relax by at night before you go to bed. I enjoy it very much, it has a nice challenge to it, but for me, it is just a simple way for one to relax and gives the brain a peaceful moment.
B008NW67E0|2.0|It starts quiet, builds louder, then builds to everyone singing and banjo playing fast, then maybe gets quiet again. Lyrics that sound profound about how I won't be stopped or I'll hold out but don't really make a lot of sense. They all sound like variations of themes and tunes from the last album. It is a cool sound, but gets old after 2-3 songs.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Still a bad story line. Yes he is rich! Get over it. If I have to read \\"Oh my Fifty\\" or \\"Oh my Mr. Grey, Yes Mrs. Grey\\" one more time I will throw my Kindle. (If I had the book I would of burned it) Not worth the hype. And DONT MAKE A MOVIE!
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Another great album from one of metal's most consistently solid bands. Cool tunes, great guitar work, and killer energy! Testament still play like they have something to prove, and I for one, hope they keep doing it this way. The production is spot on as well. Kudos!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Loved this game on my Kindle Fire! When I upgraded to the Kindle Fire HD, I was less pleased.  The graphics are more difficult to read unless I wear magnifying lenses.  And this is when I play in the landscape mode!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Omg wat else could you ask for? gives you weather tweets maps serve warnings seasonal allergie warnings its just great!!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|If you were a fan of Mumford & Son's breakout record, \\"Sigh No More\\", chances are you will immediately love this album. It's filled with the same melodic styling, guitars, and banjos that came with the first. And this is in no way a bad thing. Fast paced banjos and acoustic guitars are a defining sound for this group, and their sophomore album is no different. But it is more refined. The quality immediately stood out to me as an improvement. Subtle nuances are much more noticeable and there's a certain depth to the sound and the balance of ever component that makes this album an improvement off the first. Not a leap, but at the very least a step.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"Sigh No More\\" you should enjoy \\"Babel\\".
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app really helps when i need to check my juice i recommend it for you! its so awesome. thanks!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Often,  Pinterest crashes when starting up. Also, I wish I could add a new pin with the mobile, Kindle version. I love Pinterest, but I don't like being limited to repinning others' photos. I find I often have to switch to my computer for full functionality.
1604680547|1.0|I did not quite expect to get so many variances in heart shape in the book. Considering on the variety of flowers and animal in real life, I expected a broader selection of such. I was very dissappointed. I would not have bought the book if I would have known this.
B004F1F32A|4.0|Exciting movie is well worth the rent!  Neeson is a great in this movie and very believable as a bad ass dad trying to get his daughter back.  Good action scenes and can't wait to see what they do with Taken 2.
0307405095|5.0|This is the best and most thorough pie and tart cookbook I have ever seen!  It came quickly after ordering on Amazon.com, and easy to read with beautiful illustrations of each recipe. It is paperback, but large and very sturdy. The cover is a wipe free paper product which will be useful for we bakers who dig into the dough. Great tips, clear and simplistic instructions--and a variety of pies and tarts that would appeal to bakers for all occasions!  I love that you can also use storebought puff pastry, which still results in beautiful home made versions.  I hope to bake as many of the selections as possible over the holidays to give as gifts.  I am already increasing my workout sessions as a precaution!  Happy Baking!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game! I only wish there wasn't an add between every game. I assume the pay version is ad free??
B00005JLXE|5.0|WELL I LOVED THIS MOVIE IT WAS A SERIOUS STORY LINE NOTHING FAKE ABOUT IT AND BULL'S EYE WAS A AWSOME BAD GUY NEVER MISSED TILL HE MET THE AWSOME DAREDEVIL HAHAHAHAHAHA.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Cool, fun &amp; entertaining game. A bit easy, but good overall. Wish it had more levels, great job developers, keep the fun coming.
1401307450|5.0|Anthony Kieidis pulls no punches, holds nothing back, and leaves nothing out of this gripping book.  I've never turned pages faster in my life.  This is a walk through the life of Anthony Kiedis.  From his late childhood through his years with the Chili Peppers.  The foot is never let off the gas.  Some of the depictions are difficult to believe, but trust me, as the story goes on you really get to know the true life of a rockstar.  I don't see Skynard of Zepplin riding any rougher than Kiedis.  This one is a must read, no exceptions.  Roller coaster doesn't begin to describe this ride.  It's like none other.  I'm tired of trying to formulate an adequate description.  Just read it!! It goes by fast.  Hold on..
B00633W614|3.0|I was so fascinated by the first episode in the Clifton chronicles that I had to buy 'The Sins of the Fathers', which I quickly finished. As there's obviously so much more that is going to emerge in the plot, I am just going to have to wait for Jeffrey Archer to publish the third episode.
1606995359|4.0|Carl Barks' Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge comics have been<br />reprinted/recycled too many times to list.  Russ Cochran<br />started the bandwagon rolling, after which Gemstone<br />took up the slack - as well as publishers around the world.<br /><br />So here comes Fantagraphics hardcovers: nicely reproduced, themed,<br />and expanded upon with excellent pieces about \\"the duck man\\"<br />along with commentaries on each Donald and Unca Scrooge tale.<br /><br />Usually they include about four complete comic book stories,<br />shorter works and one-pagers.  I think, after all these years,<br />I still prefer Uncle Scrooge for his fanatically perverse love<br />of his money.  Donald, as father-figure for \\"the boys\\"<br />seems just a bit goody two-shoes, given his volatile behavior<br />in his cartoons.<br /><br />Wonderful volumes, if the first two are any indication.<br />Pick 'em up - and don't forget Fantagraphics is also reprinting<br />Floyd Gottfredson's beautiful MICKEY MOUSE daily newspaper strips<br />starting from April 1930.  Now there IS some great stuff:<br />early Mickey was a roustabout, always poking his proboscis<br />where it wasn't wanted.  Violent, clever, wacky: you won't believe<br />the wildness and weirdness (compared to \\"the ducks\\", above).
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano are both really great. Chris Nolan, the director, (the Dark Knight) is masterful. The remaining cast is Excellent. Unique premise and muti-layered MYSTERY with a dose of IRONIC HUMOR. An element of grey matter must be employed through entire movie. A modern day film noir. I really liked it. Guy Pearce is one of our best contemporary actors and this film is a shining example of that. The guy (no pun intended) is dynamic.<br />Living life with NO SHORT TERM MEMORY makes life BEYOND CONFUSING and DIFFICULT. Written and filmed in a Tarantinoesque manner.
0307743659|5.0|What a book.  This book is tough to put down.  King is super descriptive as always and it may drag at times, but you are so engulfed in his world.  The movie was fantastic, but the book out punches the movie.  There are certain parts of the book that were left out of the movie that seriously raises the hair off the back of your neck.  Incredibly frightening stuff.  Just like all books that were made into movies, there is so much more to dive into with the characters and the setting.  The hotel has much more history to it than is portrayed in the movie.  The characters have so much more depth to them.  The most interesting/different portion from the movie was Dick Hallorann.  There is so much more to him, and his role with Jack is so intense.  The situation with him trying to get in touch with the hotel is so gut wrenching that it adds another layer.  This is a must read if you're a fan of the movie.  Even if you aren't the biggest reader, this one is special.  Stephen King shines again.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Riveting and spell binding - I am almost finished the third book and cannot stop reading, so have finished them all too quickly! I have not watched the movie yet, but now cannot wait to...
B000VNMMPM|4.0|Ah, Luc Besson!  I first became aware of his work with<br />THE FIFTH ELEMENT, that most HEAVY METAL of outre sci-fi<br />films starring Bruce Willis (Bruce Willis?) as a man<br />assigned to save the world; Chris Tucker as a screeching<br />interplanetary d.j.; Gary Oldman as a villain who makes<br />one trip too many; and the luscious red-haired Milla Jovovich<br />as The Fifth Element.  (\\"Mooltie-pass.).<br /><br />Then there was LEON - THE PROFESSIONAL, featuring the sombre<br />Jean Reno as a ghostly hitman; Natalie Portman as his<br />unexpected preteen protoge; and Gary Oldman (again!) as a really<br />over the top psychopath.<br /><br />I went on to acquire Besson's early stuff, passing on THE MESSENGER<br />and his kid flick.  He stopped making movies, started producing<br />them.  But then I discovered this admittedly minor flick,<br />ANGEL-A.<br /><br />Shot in in Paris in supernaturally beautiful black and white,<br />ANGEL-A gives us a poor, lowly gang write-off (Jamel Debbouze,<br />who played the \\"slow\\" green-grocer's assistant in AMELIE), about to commit<br />suicide because of debts.  Just as he is about to plunge into the river, he sees<br />a leggy blonde giantess (Rie Rasmussen) on the next parapet who jumps before he<br />does.  He plunges, saves her - then learns she may or may not<br />be an \\"angel\\" out to save him from himself.<br /><br />Yes, for Besson this is a minor tale.  But it is also a gorgeous<br />\\"portrait\\" of the City of Light, one which will leave you<br />with a smile on your face.<br /><br />Thanks, Luc, for reassuring us there can be happy endings.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Robert Rodriquez did a brilliant job with this movie and cast. Mixing comic book with real life. Incredible visually. Very impressive. I thought the Mickey Rourke character was so well done by both Rodriquez and  Rourke. I liked it completely. For me, this movie is about cinematic art. But don't be confused, this is not an art movie by as means. ADULT COMIC BOOK. The back story on production and history of original comics is great.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|I bought this before my last vacation trip.... now i'm wondering how I ever managed without it!<br />So easy to use! Just download the map/maps of where you will be.... and they are ready to use when you need them.<br />Lots of businesses are listed but not all.<br />Still I think that this is a great app!
B008I3QZKU|1.0|I've been a fan of the Killers for a Long time, from Hot Fuss to Day and Age-however I feel like each record is a decent into their own \\"creativity\\". This record is a bit self indulging. dull lyrics, repeated progressions and musical sections. A half effort really. They have come to realize their musical limitations and make up for it with pseudo mystique and far out lyrical content.
B004D3BPH2|5.0|I kept hearing a little bit of Telemann's works on the radio here and there - generally I like music from this period - and finally got around to looking for some to buy.  Thought I would take the plunge with the complete works.  Wow.  Why did I wait?  27 hours of Telemann. Amazing.  Even more amazing than I ever dreamed his works were.<br />The last three cds were mostly opera - and I've never cared for the operatic voice, so these three I kinda skipped over - just a personal preference, no reflection on the quality of the composition or performances.<br />I've only had chance to listen to the entire set once so far, but doubtless this work will be in my collection as long as I can hear.
B0001US62I|4.0|Very well done. All the actors are very good, But Mickey Rourke is especially a stand out in this cast. He shines in this one. A combination HORROR/NOIR that will keep your attention and not \\"miss a beat.\\" The special features have a very interesting current day interview with Mickey Rourke. Interesting time lines and locations. EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down. I was enthralled and captivated by the details and plot of this book. It is a story of time travel, consequences of such, history, courage, and the things we do for love. It is more realistic/plausible (so to speak) than other stories of time travel I have read. I highly recommend 11/22/63. You won't be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this game for free. LOVE IT.! it starts out slow but once you get going you cant stop. the coins are a little expensive but if you are patient you don't need to buy them.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent and easy to read. Lots of background on training and bonding. Brings back many memories of my military training. God bless those that serve, go in harms way, so that others may live free.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A moving story that I can relate to on so man levels. This is where I put my agnostic, cynical side on a time out and just opened up to her message of living a life without fear.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good story.  Nice to have the real facts even though our government lied about the whole thing.  I don't think he should be prosecuted as he didn't reveal any secrets. Brave man, we need more like him.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The dvds came in about a week and in great condition. The inside list of chapters was also there which made me happy. Most people just throw them away. This was a good buy.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|A beautiful work of art, portraying many important life lessions.  In heavy rotation in my favorite film library.  You do not have to be a sushi lover to appreciate this film.
0553807919|5.0|I have read Daniel Siegel research in text books for my degree in clinical psychology. When I learned that he wrote a parenting book, I thought, I have to get it! I have read many parenting books before and while I have gotten good advice from them, Daniel Siegel explaines the science behind it. I highly recommend this book to parents because it will help you to understand why your kids behave in certain way and how to handle it. It is all about the brain!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a typical romance novel plot. Rich powerful enigmatic male. Innocent, virginal, curious female.  Add psychology research paper on domination/s and m sex and you have the vehicle for delivery. I can't even refer to it as a plot because their isn't one anywhere in the pages of this book. The characters are boring. The sequence of events predictable. I wasted $10 on the e book version. I gave up halfway though the book because it was  so exceptionally unexceptional.
0783233477|5.0|I have owned this DVD for years, and just watched it for the first time in a very long time. It amazes me how this film moves you....it takes you in every direction an emotion can go. It is superb in every way, especially the acting, and after just seeing it again, I have to say that I believe this is one of the best pictures of all time. Kudos to the director, the actors, to all
B0090P98Z4|5.0|great game don't start unless you got a couple hours to play most addictive game I have played since call of duty
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I could not lay this book down, it had lots of intrigue and the characters were wonderful. Jack is a great character, he carries so much knowledge about the U.S. in his head, I think every book you read gives you some serious thought on how some agencies work or at least how they should work. I read at the back of the book that a movie should be released in December with Tom Cruise playing the part of Jack. There has got to be a actor someplace that fits the description of Jack, and Tom is not the one, From the character in the book I would be disappointed before the movie started. Altho I would love to see a movie made of all his books as long as we got the right actor to play Jack.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|anybody who love a challenge has to get this game:) :) this game I so fun you can you don't have use you own money you just earn coins and you can get what ever you want. if you get this game you should rate it.
B009B50QOU|1.0|I've been listening to Green Day since Dookie came out.  On all of the albums, I've been able to find at least one or two songs that I really loved.  However, this is the first Green Day album that I can honestly say I hate.  I'm told that Uno is supposed to be some sort of a power pop punk album, but all the songs seem half done, soul-less, and well below the standard that I would expect from Green Day.  Some of the songs you can hear bits and pieces of other better Green Day songs from past albums.  Others tracks you can hear hints of popular songs from other artist.  All the songs come across as if Green Day was trying too hard to write pop hits, but completely missed the mark.<br /><br />In no way does Uno live up to the days of Dookie or American Idiot.  It does not capture the teen angst of Kerplunk or 1039/Smoothed Out Sloppy Hours.  It sadly isn't even on the level of some of the lesser albums like International Super Hits.<br /><br />If Green Day was focusing on only one album instead of Uno, Dos, Tre, I don't think any of these songs would see the light of day.  My hope is that Green Day just needed to get this album and songs out of their system before releasing Dos and Tre, hopefully putting out some good music.
B0043VDIAG|1.0|...and this book is a very thinly disguised copy of that movie!  I can't understand why the writer of \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" hasn't sued. NEVER will I buy another of Nicholas Spark's books.
B008RV5K5E|2.0|The movie is great, and I am sure most fans of the DC animated shows/movies will love it.  But I am so tired of all of these films coming with UV instead of iTunes Digital copies.
0525952926|5.0|In times that history seems to repeat itself a wonderful book to remind all that things can go terribly wrong when we stop paying attention.An excellent second book to the trilogy and I cannot wait to read to final book.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|Works exactly as it should. Easy to set-up to sync desktop with my android smartphone. Sync is wireless via my home network.
0345528581|5.0|A truly wonderful \\"bible\\" of training advice, applicable to almost anyone. One of the few books like this that really delivers. Looks great and well written. Cheap at twice the price.
B004G600A4|5.0|Plenty of reviews already focus on the story (which is wonderfully done), so I'll just say, the disk came in excellent condition and played well. Excellent shipping, came quickly, well packaged, etc.<br /><br />Oh and the soundtrack is wonderful, go get that too!
0525953728|5.0|I am only half way through this book and like other reviewers am throughly enthralled. I, on the other hand am taking more time to read this one, and savoring each chapter like a fine wine. I read no more than one chapter a day and let the full weight of its message settle in my brain before moving on. I am grateful to the author for giving us background on his experrience as a DEVGRU SEAL; that is is not only hard to do but the fears and challanges of the seemingly flawless men. They are truly the top one percent of the top one percent and America is lucky that they are our side. I also appreciate how the author in relating his combat experience weaves his knowledge of terriorist tactics into the UBL mission.<br /><br />Even thought I know how the mission ends I am eagerly anticipating the details (as best the author can share without compramising national security)of how this mission went down.<br /><br />For now I can say it is a great read for any patriotic American, who appreciates the sacfifice that our militray men and women make for our safety.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|If I'm not reading novels on my Kindle Fire, I am playing the timed MahJong games trying to earn 3 stars p/game.  Some games are easy to achieve but some are so difficult that I've been working on them for weeks.  I like the challenge of trying to get that 3rd star in under 5 min.!  What's amazing to me is that I can so easily not see the partner tile even right under my nose!!  Ahhhh, but I keep trying!

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game! Many hours spent playing. I really enjoy this and can not wait for the second one to come out.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|This novel starts off really well: vintage Lee Child storytelling, peeling off layers one at a time and keeping you in suspense about what is going on. But by the end of it I was just disappointed with the lack of action--Reacher doesn't even get into any fights? Impossible. This must be a first. And no love interest, either--yet another first. When the whole evil plot is finally revealed at the end, it just feels manufactured.<br /><br />Definitely not as exciting as his other novels.

B0094U0RJQ|5.0|I didn't care much for most of the last three Dylan albums (the Americana ones; you know, the one's that sounded like 30' and 40's music).<br /><br />When I want to listen to Dylan, I listen mostly to the older stuff (up to Time Out of Mind), and some freakin' wonderful bootlegs.<br /><br />But the Bobster has knocked this one out of the park. What's the difference?<br /><br />I dunno. Maybe it's me; maybe it's Bob, but this album grabbed me immediately, and hasn't let go.<br /><br />Stay forever young, Bob. And thanks for giving us Tempest.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|First, lots of people on here are already giving a detailed, song-by-song breakdown of the entire album, so I won't do that here.<br /><br />But I will now mention that you have to give this album some time to really appreciate it.  The same thing happened with Day and Age--after the first few listens, it didn't seem to really draw me in.  But as a huge Killers fan, I trusted that Flowers and Co. knew what they were doing.  So I kept playing it, over and over, until it really clicked for me.  I soon found that Day and Age is a great album.<br /><br />I found myself in the same situation with Battle Born.  I anxiously awaited for this albums' release, and the first day it was available, I gave it a few listens, and nothing stuck out to me.  But I kept at it, and I realize that it's a great album.  It's no Sam's Town or Hot Fuss, but it's great nonetheless.<br /><br />I found it funny that many reviewers are saying things along the lines of \\"this isn't the Killers I know\\" or \\"Battle Born is nothing like Hot Fuss, don't waste your money\\".  It's also funny that the Killers/Brandon Flowers haven't made another Hot Fuss-type of album, in what, 5 or 6 albums now?  Maybe, just maybe, Hot Fuss was the outlier of the Killers' catalog, and what we've been listening to from Sam's Town on truly exemplifies just what the Killers really are.  Hot Fuss was released 8 years ago.  They were a young group then.  Get over it, already.<br /><br />But I digress...<br /><br />You can tell when listening to Battle Born that Brandon's vocals are fantastic.  I mean, he's always been a fantastic vocalist with a distinctive voice, but his voice is much more pronounced on Battle Born than on previous albums.  Because of this, it seems that the rest of the band is pushed a bit more into the background.  Sadly, there really are no killer guitar hooks (ala 'Uncle Johnny') or bass lines (ala 'Jenny') on this album.<br /><br />Some notable tracks:<br /><br />Runaways: A solid track, and will surely sound great live (which reminds me, if you haven't seen the Killers live yet, do yourself a favor and do so).  There are two or three tracks on Battle Born that I feel are more suitable for playing live... this was one of them, for sure (tell me you can't see Brandon thrusting the mic stand in the air at the last chorus of this song).<br /><br />Here With Me: Another one destined to be a great live track.  Sounds a lot like an arena ballad.  At first I thought a few of the lyrics were a bit strange (\\"Don't want your picture on my cellphone\\"), and I guess I still do, but they do work well overall.<br /><br />Be Still: It's a great song, but it would have been far more powerful without the lame drum machine (frankly, it sounds cheap).  This one will be awesome live, if it's just Brandon on the piano.  Check out the 'alternative' version of it on youtube--that's the version that should have ended up closing out this album.<br /><br />Miss Atomic Bomb: This is simply the gem of the Killers' latest release (just the title will tell you how awesome this song is).  It's the 'Dustland Fairytale' of Battle Born, explosions and all.  It's also tied to 'Mr. Brightside', lyrically and musically, complete with Brightside's guitar riff in the background as well (you CAN hear it, right?). When its all said and done, this track is certain to go down as one of the Killers' top songs.  Play this and play it loud.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great album. Just be patient and let it grow onto you.sound great live (which reminds me, if you haven't seen the Killers live yet, do yourself a favor and do so).

B007THA4FI|5.0|I've only gotten about halfway through the book, but I can honestly say that I've been enjoying it. The characters are beautifully realistic. I think that as someone who grew up reading Harry Potter it is very nice to see J.K Rowling writing again. So far I have loved this new different novel, but it makes me honestly upset to be critiquing it for its format and it's price. And I at least read a story for the story itself and not for its looks.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I really don't know what to write about this book. My views are still pretty conflicted on whether I loved it or absolutely hated it. It's just that there were so many parts that were ridiculously dumb at times and other parts which were so sweet, I still have my \\"Awwwwww\\" moments when I remember them.<br /><br />No matter how hard I tried, I still couldn't bring myself to like either Abby or Travis. Initially, yes they seemed interesting but as the story moved on, I couldn't help but wonder what the hell is wrong with these two. Travis seemed obsessed with Abby, overly obsessed at times and that was quite disturbing. There were many incidents in which Travis acted...abnormally and quite frankly, like a freaking insane person and yet Abby just dumbly got over it for whatever reasons.<br />Also, tattooing the girl's name and professing his eternal love for her in the second or third week of their relationship is so not cool. Okay, I get it that they were thoroughly in love with each other but seriously?<br />And I don't even want to begin about what I thought of them marrying and already talking about kids when they hadn't even graduated from college!! That's just plain freaky. No offense, Miley Cyrus.<br /><br />Despite all this, I still can't deny that fact that this book was thoroughly engrossing. Yes, there were many holes in the story and in the end the message that this book gave (according to me) was not at all right. But still, I liked the writing style, certain jokes that were amusing and some scenes where I could actually see myself connecting with the female protagonist. There were times when I even warmed up to Travis, though that was pretty rare. I really, really liked Abby's best friend America who was supportive, protective and damn perfect as far as best friends go. I guess she was the only character in the book that remained a constant favorite of mine throughout the story.<br /><br />Overall, I had equal amounts of love-hate feelings while reading this book and thus I'm gonna stick with 3 stars. I wouldn't recommend this to the YA readers as even though the female protagonist is 19, this book should still be shelved in Adult romance or something like that.his book and thus I'm gonna stick with 3 stars.

B005FUTBWS|5.0|Have all the movies, Spoken word, books, I've been a smith fan for a long time.<br />This is totally different than anything Smith has ever done. With this being Smith's first Horror film, it's far from it...I would say unrelenting action and suspense.<br />Tarantino having a 3-way with Waco and Fred Phelps.<br />The head shots were amazing and most of the deaths were not expected either which made it awesome. The Plot is not hard to follow and is a major plus, most times taking in a film i want to be entertained not a mental workout. That being said this isn't a simplistic meat-headed body count film either.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I hated using my Fire to Pin before, because it took so long to load and the repin buttons never worked right. Now it's a breeze! The new app makes cruising Pinterest using my Fire such a joy. It's still not as fast as my iPhone but the improvement is phenominal.
159420411X|3.0|I admit, we both devoured Nate Silver's previous book -- \\"The Sizzle and the Steak: Why Ponderosa Steakhouses are bound to Disappoint.\\"  It was insightful and timely, and really helped us lower our expectations.<br /><br />We were looking forward to this book, hoping it would show us how to get our pesky radio in the AMC to finally tune in.  This book was lacking in the diagrams and technical information that made his first book so successful.<br /><br />I'm hoping for better things from his next project: \\"The Glance and the Ceiling: How Looking Up and To The Left Helps You Remember Stuff -- But Often Fails.\\"
B0058YPL66|5.0|Once upon a Time is one of my most favorite TV shows of all time. I could not wait for the DVD to come out. I have loved anything to do with fantasy and fairy tales my whole life, and was not disappointed in this show one bit.The  DVD is wonderful, I couldn't wait to see all the episodes again, and of course the special features are amazing. It's great to see all the actors talking about their characters, and how much they enjoy fairy tales too. I'm a grandma, whose granddaughter loves the show as much as I do, so we have been watching all the episodes together, it's fun to know that all ages love this show, we can't wait until Sunday when the new episodes start. After all we are all kids at heart. I saw my first fantasy movie when I was 9 years old and have been hooked ever since. My favorite character in Once upon a Time is Rumplestiltskin, Robert Carlyle's portrayal of him is absolutely fantastic. All the actors in fact do an amazing job. Love it!!!!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like this app and would give it 5 stars except for the fact that it almost never opens the first time and I have to do a 'force close' and then try again.  Actually, it stops working pretty frequently and has to be closed.  But it's really easy to repin things and to do searches so, overall, I'm pretty happy with it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|pretty good game. a little addictive. don't know if there is more to it but it still ducks you in. a fun time killer.

0316228532|5.0|The book was great and I will love to re-read it again and again. I really hope Jo goes for more books- Adult or Fantasy and that I will continue reading them. This story is great. The price may be high but it is worth it. You see, it's all about different points. Like Shirley Mollison who HATES Barry Fairbrother or Mary Fairbrother the wife of Barry. Please buy the book and see whats going on in Pagford.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Avengers was awesome and much like the X-Men  with the Wolverine spin off, the movie has improved all the way...... With Joss Whedon directing the whole story line went up a notch and if and when there is another Thor, Iron Man and Captain America it will be great! Similar to Batman the Dark Night with Christian Bale, all it takes is the right stars and directing and the Dark Knight sequel has improved the whole Batman series a thousand times. Well, to not spoil the movie for anyone, they had a great choice for the incredible Hulk ( Mark Ruffalo), which was more like the original character versus the ones in the previous Incredible Hulk movies. There was constant action and supporting stars like Samuel L.Jackson added to the movies overall story line. I look forward to seeing the next Avengers but this one is really a keeper. I hope the next Thor and Captain America come up a notch to complement this movie.
B007Z5M6F0|5.0|This has to be one of the best love stories I have EVER seen. May not have the standard ending but what a ride getting there. Puts you into a time and place that our generation (thankfully) will never have to live through. Though it truly makes you appreciate the struggles that those who went before us made, for us. I can not recommend this movie/series more highly. This one is good for men and women alike as you have love and war both portrayed beautifully well.
B004ZQ74G8|5.0|Having published several novels myself dealing with issues very similar to the abuse described in Room, I was very interested in how Ms. Donahue would tackle this difficult subject. Reading the narration of a 5-year old child was tedious at first; but I discovered how crucial that perspective was once Jack found 'freedom'.  The result was a perspective that was so profound and moving that I now realize why this book was a finalist for the Man Booker Award. The ending was especially brilliant. If you want to have your eyes and hearts opened, this book is a must-read. Kevin P. White (award-winning author of Inside a Hollow Tree).
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|I've been listening to Bob Dylan since 1964, and have not purchased all of his albums.  There have been times in his career, when I didn't buy his music, and other times that I bought an album and liked only a song or two.  It is amazing to me that his new album, The Tempest is almost as good as some of the music he created in the sixties and seventies.  Most of his contemporaries stopped creating long, long ago, and it is remarkable that The Tempest is so listenable.

1935670913|4.0|The book itself is reasonably well written. But the stupendous success of this author marketing books that he himself admits aren't that good cannot be denied. Mr. Locke's marketing techniques are worth finding out about. But I have heard that there is much about the success of his books that this book doesn't tell you.

B000UZPIAW|4.0|I read this in a few hours, couldn't put it down. I have no idea how this man survived and how any of these people got out of the 80's without overdosing or contracting HIV. Definitely not a glamorous life! Still love their music and that they were the last of real rockstars.

B002JC9RMY|1.0|To any who want to buy this movie, I will give you a few less painful alternatives; you could A-drink a bottle of Hydrochloric acid, B-stick your hand in a blender, or C-chew glass. No matter what you pick, watching this film would be a thousand times more horrible.<br />This movie is on the level of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and if you have seen that, then you should know not to get this horrible live-action adaptation. The flaws are all the same; too rushed, a lack of vital characters, and no connection to the original story. It is just terrible. There is nothing good about it. If I had to put my hatred for this movie on a scale of one to ten, it would be OVER 9000.<br />That is how much I despise this movie.

I am a Rob Pattinson fan, have seen all of his movies (except his newest, Cosmopolis) and I believe this performance truly shows his range of ability.  I had read the book but found that it was not nearly as interesting as the movie.

B002F6FQGK|4.0|Florence Welch clearly has one of the more distinctive voices I've heard in the last few years.  She can belt out powerful notes, scream, or go soft all in quick and exhilirating fashion.  Her lyrics are unique and interesting as well. The best songs are \\"Kiss with a Fist,\\" \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" \\"Howl,\\" and \\"Drumming Song.\\"  If you like anything you've heard by Florence and the Machine on the radio, you should buy this album!
0525953728|2.0|I was impressed with the incredible training and self-sacrifice these guys go through BUT, as an author, this book, and the author, leaves a lot to be desired.<br />It's loaded with Acronyms and military speak, super macho, testosterone driven dialogue, which makes for difficult reading for anyone not exposed to the Military.<br />Certainly there is nothing in the book to endanger National Security, in my opinion.

Show this to your kids and they will love math by the end of it (okay, that's a stretch, but a lot could be said about this anti-hero archetype that's neither a dark-eyed emo, nor the star player of an underdog football team).

B0034JGBM0|4.0|When the White Stripes called it a day a few years ago, it probably was not a great surprise, as Jack White was increasingly becoming restless and feeling restricted in the White Stripes format. Plus, what did the band have to prove anymore at that point? Nothing, that's what. Now the only thing that felt incomplete in the musical catalog was an official live album. That has been addressed with this 2010 release.<br /><br />\\"Under Great White Northern Lights\\" (16 tracks; 59 min.) was recorded on the band's Canadian summer 2007 tour. After introductory Scottish pipes, the band dives in, feet first, with \\"Let's Shake Hands\\", which is followed by an even better \\"Black Math\\", one of my all-time favorite tracks of the band, and check out also Meg's excellent drumming on here (she's always been underrated as a drummer in my book). After that, Jack and Meg take us all over the White Stripes' catalog, and as such this album really fronts as a \\"Greatest Hits Live\\" compilation. Check out excellent sounding tracks like \\"Ball and Chain\\", \\"Jolene\\", and \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself\\". The album climaxes with the band's break-out track \\"Fell In Love With a Girl\\" and of course \\"Seven Nation Army\\", here in a 7 min. explosion.<br /><br />I've had the good fortune of seeing the White Stripes in concert a number of times during their career. As good as their studio albums were, there was only one way to get the full White Stripes experience, and that was of course to see them live. Their shows were usually nothing short of mesmerizing. In that sense, it is only fitting that the final album to be released by the White Stripes is this live album, which is the best possible time capsule of the band, bar none. \\"Under Great White Northern Lights\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I liked it for the first half or so and then it turned into sex every few pages and there really wasn't much of a story line :-( Don't waste your money
B005LAII6W|3.0|I honestly prefer the RE movies series to be more like Silent Hill movie, but that is asking too much with Anderson as a director and the path the VG series has taken.  I thought this movie was cheesy, but I still liked it because RE is my favorite gaming franchise.  The plot I thought was 1 off or if you missed it, probably doesn't matter.  This is comparable to [[ASIN:B004UDB9SA Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City]] in the VG trilogy.  If you don't play it you migh tnot missedd much.  If you like action this has it.  Got some of my favorite characters like Leon, Barry Burton (didn't like his ending, uber cheesy), Jill, Ada, and the licker.  If you don't like RE then this movie is just another action flick.<br /><br />I saw and paid for the Imax 3D, had good effects, but I like [[ASIN:B002ZG98UK Resident Evil: Afterlife [Blu-ray 3D]]](which I own) more.  Seem like every single Re characters came back to life except Forest.  Thought Afterlife was better overall.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I was not able to put this book down. I have read all of the Jack Reacher books and this ranks right up there with the very best of them.  The farther you get into the book the better it gets.  It is one of those books you hate to see end.  Love Lee Child's writing and so look forward to his books. I highly recommed this book.

It is beautiful and every page sparked true feeling (some parts made me genuinely depressed) I enjoyed seeing Lena grow and evolve as a young woman. And of course...there's Alex. I'd have to say that he is one of my favorite love interests in the recent books I've read.<br /><br />For you Hunger Games seekers, go re-read Hunger Games and stop looking for other books just like it. This is its own book.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Back in March when the concert DVD, Joe Bonamassa Beacon Theater Live From New York , was released, I basically said, \\"Love it. Buy it. Now!\\"  For the CD soundtrack of that DVD, it's obvious that I'm going to say the same exact thing.<br /><br />And, just as I said in that review, I'll say in this review of the CD, the guitar prodigy knocks it out of the park yet again with a tremendous delivery of 20 tunes - 6 of them with a little help from his friends Beth Hart (I'll Take Care of You and Sinner's Prayer), John Hiatt (Down Around My Place  and I Know A Place), and Paul Rodgers (Fire and Water and Walk In My Shadow) and all of them great.  The only number that's not on this CD that is on the DVD is the second bonus track on the DVD, Woke Up Dreaming, which is a crying shame but nowhere near a deal breaker.<br /><br />Just like the DVD, the CD starts out with playing an acoustic guitar in a New York subway, trying to earn some money without much success.  The next number is then from inside the beautiful and iconic Beacon Theater where the real show begins with an incredible deliver of Slow Train from Joe's latest CD, Bust Bowl. Just as with the DVD, from the opening note on, you will be mesmerized.  Of course, the all-time Boomerocity favorite tune, Mountain Time, is performed on this CD - this time with a great little blues riff added towards the end of the solo.  I imagine guitarists the world over will be mimicking that lick (or try to) as a result.<br /><br />So, I've said all of that to say this: Love it. Buy it. Now!

B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works great and is very impressive.  Love my Kindle Fire and love Pinterest.  I am overall very pleased.
B005USZYDU|2.0|A huge disappointment from a world class author, this book, while slow to start, had an interesting premise involving a great kid. The real problem with this book is the ending. It just ends without conclusion, almost in the middle of a thought. The book builds the reader to a point where some possible danger and suspense has emerged, and just ends, without conclusion. I was sure that I must have gotten an incomplete kindle version, so looked at the book on line, which ended just where my version did. I then read the reviews and discovered this was not an error, but a glaring fault. Up to that point, I was very satisfied with the book and would have rated it 4 stars. It warrants only 2 stars as it is an incomplete work. A real surprise given the author. This book was ONLY published because of the author's reputation. It would have been rejected if presented to the publisher from any unknown author.
B004JK61K0|2.0|This product is only so-so. It's plain and straightforward which is usually a good thing, but does not give a good preview of emails. Categorization of emails is difficult leaving the reader with just a long list of everything in all inboxes.<br />Deleted the app after a few days.
B008OTTSX4|5.0|This year marks the 40th anniversary of the release of this landmark album and in recognition of the influence of the band, and of Machine Head in particular, some of rock music's biggest names have each contributed a version of their favorite track on the album to create Re-Machined - A Tribute To Deep Purple's Machine Head.<br /><br />Re-Machined features specially recorded tracks from Jimmy Barnes & Joe Bonamassa, Black Label Society, Chickenfoot, former Deep Purple Mk III member Glenn Hughes with Chad Smith of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Iron Maiden, the \\"supergroup\\" Kings Of Chaos (featuring Joe Elliott, Steve Stevens, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum), Metallica, Carlos Santana & Jacoby Shaddix and Steve Vai.<br /><br />There are two wildly differing versions of the album's most famous track Smoke On The Water, one from guitar hero Carlos Santana with vocals by Jacoby Shaddix and one from alternative rockers Flaming Lips, and Metallica have contributed their own special take on When A Blind Man Cries, a track recorded at the Machine Head sessions but originally released as the B-side to Never Before.<br /><br />Iron Maiden's Space Truckin' cover was actually recorded back in 2006. Lead singer Bruce Dickinson explains, \\"Initially we didn't think we'd be able to contribute anything due to our touring commitments. Then we remembered Space Truckin which we'd recorded as a single B-side during our A Matter Of Life And Death album session, but never used. However now, thanks to Kevin Shirley's remixing skills, we're able to include it on Re-Machined\\".<br /><br />Initially released as a limited edition Classic Rock \\"fanpack\\" on September 3, this is a truly unique release that will appeal to rock fans everywhere.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com
B001UGIIMA|4.0|this is one of my favorite movies, finally i get it on blu-ray if you haven´t seen it i recommend it widely
1906735875|2.0|I hadn't even heard of Judge Dredd prior to the movie. After I watched the film-and was blown away- I decided to purchase this collection. The mega-city 1 in the comics is a far more futuristic, almost utopic one: complete with flying cars and talking robots. Contrasted with the movie version of Mega City 1, a crime-filled slum-city, I was pretty let down. Also, the plots in the comics are a little ridiculous (At one point, Dredd even goes to the moon.) I have read some of the reviews for the other dredd collections, and from what i understand the other dredd \\"case files\\" collections are much better than \\"case files 1\\" so i intend to purchase some of those, but i think you can skip Case Files 1 and not feel like your missing anything.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Liked it.  Gives a greater appreciation of the sacrifices our men and women of the armed forces live through.  Pretty fast paced.  Finished reading it while the first weekend of College FB was on, that doesn't usually happen.
B005LAIHCM|5.0|I don't know what some of these people are talking about.  There was nothing predictable about this movie.  I am a huge thriller/horror fan.  I've seen everything and lately there hasn't been anything good coming into the theater's.  Typically you watch five minutes of a movie and you know how it will end.  I thought it would be the same with this movie.  IT ISN'T!  It's awesome!  Jennifer Lawrence does a GREAT job!!!  Loved this movie...in the theater....and can't wait to go and see it again.  It is a definite \\"must see\\" if you are a horror movie fan!!!
B005721W9O|5.0|A truly fabulous romp through space with the aging cast of a science fiction t.v. show. Loaded with laughs and irony, this film is a delight for sci-fi fans. If you like Sigourney Weaver in her role as Ripley in the Alien films or as Dana in Ghostbusters, Galaxy Quest is essential viewing. The cast is excellent and the pace of the film is brisk and refreshing. There are even some unexpectedly poignant moments involving the friendly aliens. Watch it once, you'll need to see it again.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I could see myself watching this many times.  Parts that was hilarious in the Theater was even funnier at home. I could finally understand what the characters were saying after some funny parts.
B000U0O9FM|4.0|As an independent author myself [[ASIN:B005QH1ZYW True Monsters (The Shepherds Wolf)]] I love a story with a good twist.<br />This book has a great twist!<br />Imagine you are shackled down with a job you hate committing acts of graphic catalog buying, you have no sense of self and you're angry about it.  What would you do?<br />Go through the most amazing, self destructive mid life crisis ever with what you think is your best friend.<br />This came out when I was a teenager in Alberta, Canada, and during that time my friends and I all worked as banquet waiters, or projectionists, menial boring jobs during summer vacation, making homemade gunpowder and getting into fights.  And one summer rich Americans were coming up to Calgary to have cheap liposuction.  So many in fact that there were garbage trucks lined up outside bio-dumps with no way of getting rid of it.  My friends and I thought \\"why don't they make soap?\\"<br />Six months later the paperback of Fight Club came out and we were blown away at how much of it resembled our lives.<br />That's what makes this novel relevant and terrifying!  The fact that it could happen.<br />I think what sets this novel into almost speculative fiction is the fact that it sort of has happened (9/11 didn't throw us into the stone age, and it involved getting rid of buildings, more like the movie, since events happen a lot more differently in the book).<br />This novel is also a commentary on how even the most peaceful of beliefs can be turned into a dangerous creed.  Zen-Buddhism's desire for us to give up all of our worldly possession can be dangerous to a demolitions expert.<br />Many female readers were put off by this book, and that's kind of what the author wanted.  Eighty years ago women were treated as secondary citizens, and the trend is now swaying toward men being secondary citizens, with a shift away from gender equality and female superiority.  In a feminist world there is no place for men, and Mr. Palahniuk posits what would a man feel growing up in a world like that?  We would probably end up becoming more aggressive.  Fight Club almost gives men back the hunter (of hunter/gatherer) in there lives.<br />Read it for yourself.  Just don't try to make the homemade dynamite.would a man feel growing up in a world like that?  We would probably end up becoming more aggressive.

B000JMKNV0|4.0|Living on a small island (Vancouver Island) that once had a leper colony, and author of [[ASIN:B005QH1ZYW True Monsters (The Shepherds Wolf)]], I connected more deeply (I think) to the novel.  This work brilliantly captures a sense of dread and haunting usually reserved for Gothic horror stories.<br />Using a very nuanced, almost lyrical style that harkens back to crime noire we are drawn deeply into one mans quest for the truth; truth about himself, about his surroundings, and basically every theme an advanced lit. course might describe; man vs. man, man vs. self, man vs. nature, that is deceptively simple.<br />The ending is delivered in such an excellent twist that you want to put down the book screaming with tears and at once turn to the first page to read it again to find out what you missed.<br />That is a very rare quality for a book nowadays.  Many of the books we read are \\"Pick it up, kill some time, forget about it\\".<br />You won't forget this book!<br />P.S.  DON\\"T BOTHER TO WATCH THE MOVIE THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER!

0394818237|5.0|My two youngest grandchildren (both boys), have brand new \\"The Best Word Book Ever\\" books of their own.  My older ones, 18, 10, and 10, completely wore out their parent's books.  I must share that all of my children were reading before the age of five (attributable to Mr.Scarry, with whom we spent many hours each day), and so were the older grandchildren.  These books are consistently an adventure, delight, and source of many giggles!  Thank you to Richard Scarry, who seems to instinctively know just what delights a little one's heart.

0131479415|4.0|I read this book as part of a reading circle, so I went in not overly excited about the topic having already read several books that claimed to cover estimation.  I didn't expect to learn much, but I wanted to participate in the group discussion.  I don't think I could have been more wrong, this book was full of useful information from the trenches and strategies for adapting estimating to your company's process.  The book does a great job of breaking down planning into levels, describing how much effort should be put into each level's plan, and then showing how the plan is executed.  I especially enjoyed the section on calculating business value, I had never had luck translating the complexities of developing a user story into numbers that could be understood by the business stake holders in a project.  I'm looking forward to implementing some of these strategies in my upcoming projects.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|This is a chronicle of Hitchens last days of life so obviously it's not a cheery book to read. However, he was an extremely talented writer with the ability to make the reader think.  Some will likely struggle with his strong atheistic views. Reading this gave me the desire to read God is Not Great. It too is a fascinating read. Hitchens was a highly intellectual person and this is evident in his writing. I appreciated the convenience of the dictionary function on my Kindle!

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The plot of \\"The Hunger Games\\" is based on a catchy concept, and the first book of the trilogy is well written.  Subsequent books fall apart, however, as the author - who evidently didn't actually know how to end her saga - gets lost in improbabilities and wanders off to an unsatisfying ending.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love Jack Reacher...He can come in and do what is right...Lee Childs..Keep this novel guy, the way you want him to be...Please...Janet
030758836X|5.0|This was a great read.  The characters were well developed and I enjoyed the plot and pace of the story.  It kept me wanting to read to see what would happen next.  And the plot twists and turns were entertaining.  About the ending.  One word: Wow!!!
B005TUD2BK|1.0|Ordered through amazon.com on 9/26/12, package delivered today, i9/27/12.  Coupon says digital copy expires 9/20/12, but website says expires in November 2012.  However, unable to download from teh WB site - consistently get error msg telling me to download through an Adobe-Flash enabled browser.  I HAVE Adobe Flash installed, even downloaded it again more than once, same thing.  CANNNOT DOWNLOAD and that was the reason I bought this copy!  I have it on DVD, but wanted the digital copy to go with the others that I was able to get from iTunes.  If anyone can explain to me what I am doing wrong, I will be more than happy to try again, otherwise I have to send it back and get my money back.
B0098VXDDS|5.0|I cannot put into words of how good this movie is.  It is definitely not for kids...  But, this is another great saga built on the first.  I can hardly wait for the 3rd series.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|The TPU case and the screen protector are GREAT! The case is soft enough to provide a good cushion if the phone is dropped or knocked off of a table and hits a hard surface. It fit my phone perfectly. It is a little hard to get on, but I wouldn't want it any other way. It won't fall off or get pulled off if you carry your phone in your pocket. The best part is the price! My mom bought a case that's a different brand, but it's identical to this one and she paid $15 more than I did plus this one comes with a really good screen protector. The screen protector is thicker than the more expensive brand I've bought in the past for my old phone. Both items get 5 stars! I'm definately ordering one or two more so I have backups when these wear out.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very good book, not only about the Bin Laden operation but the general military life of a Navy Seal.  Also would like to note that given my background in military operations, there is nothing classified about this book nor is there any classified information discussed.  The attempt by DOD to say that there is, is only because the actual story told does not agree with the initial descriptions as told by the DOD personnel.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I have no official review for this book as I have yet to read it. However, I just downloaded it to my kindle and the font is tiny. I must set my kindle font to the biggest it allows and it is still too small to read comfortably (plus the margins are now huge). Considering it killed me to purchase an ebook for over the usual 10-12 bucks I really feel that one costing $17.99 the font should be formatted properly.
B000002LIM|5.0|This is the ultimate Batman musical score there is. Forget the other Batman soundtrack done by Prince. You'll want this soundtrack instead. It's better, epic and will blow your mind. Sorry Prince fans, I prefer this soundtrack over that crappy one he did.
B002ZG980U|5.0|REALLY fast shipping. I bought this dvd used, but that definitely wasn't a problem. The disk ran just fine, and i got 3 more movies with the money i would've spent on a new Inception dvd. All in all, its win win ^_^.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's. fun. to play every day and it doesn't get. boring at all. the app is wonderful to get I reccomend it
B001AHM2C6|5.0|While it may not be like Danny Elfman's Batman musical score, it certainly has it's own touch. I bought this limited edition version due to how collectible it is. It was worth the price I paid for it.

0937381888|5.0|This is the book everyone should start off with in brewing.  It can be used as an overview book giving you succinct process information to start brewing right away or as a scientific manual to really get down and dirty into the details of brewing.

He is a lone man in a world of intrege who always gets the job done.  From just hitching a ride to taking on an entire building of terrorists, he never fails to keep it interesting.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Projects an unadulterated view of our unseen world, establishes our spiritual connection to humanity, and the natural world around us; depicts the chaos of the corporate world from a different perspective; enthralls you with a magical Bali dance; and some disturbing chicken factory scenes.  For visuals and music, this is a masterpiece, but they should have expanded on the dance sequence towards the end as it ends abruptly and leaves you begging for more.....
0307730697|5.0|Book recommendation: Fearless, by Eric Blehm. This book is about the life of a SEAL team SIX operator by the name of Adam Brown. Not your typical SEAL book where the first half is dedicated to the arduous training experienced in BUDS, this is a book about Adam's life in it's entirety. It is a love story with a strong emphasis on his relationship with his wife and children. It is a cautionary tale as he describes his descent into the grips of a brutal drug addiction. It is a story about perseverance in many aspects of Adam's life including overcoming severe injuries suffered in training and war and how he refused to give up or even use these handicaps as an excuse for failure. Blehm describes (with brutal directness) the events preceding Adam succeeding and attaining membership in the elite SEAL team SIX fraternity. These are considered to be the best of the best, the top one percent of what is argued to be the most elite fighting force on the face of the earth.<br />This book reads like a movie and is difficult to put down. On a personal note, Adam was a coach at the same neighborhood recreation department that I coach for. He is fondly remembered by those that coached with him, the parents of the players that played for him and by his former players for being \\"the real deal\\". He remains an inspiration to those that had the honor to know him.<br />This book is appropriate for and would be enjoyed by both men and women. The lessons of morality, hard work, enthusiasm, love and perseverance told in this amazing story are great to share with your kids.<br />I hope you read this book.

B0090EIILU|1.0|I do love a good wiener fart humor movie...but this is NOT it.  Predictable, lame, unoriginal, boring.  Anna Faris and everyone else in this film should be embarrassed.  Sacha could have made this a smart, witty or dark humored flick and still included the shot of a fake big-bushed weenie coming at you.  It's got no heart, is dumbed down, and is a waste of time production.  I felt small for watching it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am not a creative person so this helps me a lot. I am enjoying looking at all the different ideas and hints from different people. Thank you!
B008C1O8CA|1.0|I've been a huge Green Day fan for a long time, but I am not one of those people who wants them to make the same album every time. I did not want another Dookie, or American Idiot, but Uno! just sounds way too clean and poppy. Rob Cavallo is a great producer, but the new sound is far too pristine. There are a few good tracks on here, but they aren't remarkable, and are pretty dull overall. I hope Dos and Tre will be better
B007IXWKUK|4.0|As much as I heard that this book was all sex and some fondly say trash  I disagree<br />I found it to have a great story line<br /> If you know anything about child abuse  you will find this a good source on what makes people tick<br />If you dont have any personal knowledge on child abuse,well, I guess I have to envy you.<br />This could very much so be a true story<br />the second book ends on a happy note .Knowing what I know about real life, I am hesitent to read the last one.<br />I fear the saddness it may bring<br />I did find it to be a book I just could not put down both of them .But than, like I said saddly this story could be someone's life<br />I found it physically and emotionaly stimulating
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Bigger Leaner Stronger is a highly recommended book!<br />I'm new to weightlifting and proper dieting, and with all the different information around the internet, I was extremely relieved when I found this book on Amazon.com. There is so many websites (and books) that will tell you how to lift and how to eat, but very few of them are actually trustworthy. And if they are, it just doesn't fit on your profile or there is very limited information available.<br /><br />This is where Bigger Leaner Stronger shines! It will tell you everything you need to know, but you will get an understanding about what you are reading, instead of just throwing around 20 terms you don't have the slightest idea what actually means. It doesn't tell you anything you (probably) couldn't find on the internet, but Mike have gathered these facts about weightlifting and dieting, and explains everything from the ground up.<br /><br />Together with Mike's [[ASIN:1478213655 The Shredded Chef]], I feel completely confident and ready to take on this challenge to get Bigger Leaner Stronger!
0545265355|5.0|One of the best trilogy's I have ever read the first book I consider the best in the series and the second book sets a great beginning to a grand war the third book starts a little slow but the last third of the book is amazing and has a great twist ending if you saw the first movie and liked it read the trilogy you won't be disappointed

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I've read all the Reacher novels. I know they aren't literature and perhaps have been made more of then they really deserve, but entertainment is entertainment. However, this latest novel is distinctly different. It is empty repetitive and if you are reading on a Kindle, nothing much happens before the 90% mark. Really.  I've read about a few interviews Child has had recently and he seems to be very cocky about his success. This was a flat out lazy book that disrespects the interests of his public.
B007THA4FI|1.0|After reading the news that this was released, I immediately went to Amazon to buy it.  At $17.99 for an e-book though, it simply isn't worth it, especially for a new, unproven series that isn't Harry Potter.  I will be waiting until the price falls or I can get it from the library as an ebook.  (Removed unhelpful comments about how much money JK needs)
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Honest, insightful and one hell of a read ! Good buildup to the final assignment.  Much needed maps & plans at the end need.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Jack Reacher's past as an MP holds many clues to the nomadic life of his more recent years, so in that sense this is \\"must\\" reading for his fans.  That said, there are several reasons why this is not among my favorites of the series.  I have added my own comment to segregate several minor spoilers.<br /><br />Mr. Child has been riding a great invention in Jack Reacher, a man who is equally adept at solving mysteries with his encyclopedic knowledge and powers of deductive reasoning, and at blasting through obstacles with his military training and great physical gifts applied violently.  The books keep these aspects of his character more or less in balance with a combination of intriguing mystery and violent confrontation(s).<br /><br />In \\"The Affair\\", the mystery is just OK, and there isn't an awful lot of action compared to some other books in the series.<br /><br />More questionable, in my mind, was Mr. Child's attempt to write some fairly explicit sex scenes into his story.  I doubt the sexual relationship was essential to the plot, and depicting it so graphically certainly wasn't.  In fact, in light of the evolution of Reacher into a modern-day Paladin (see Richard Boone, all you youngsters), casual, consequence-free sex must be seen as at least a minor contradiction in his elevated code of ethics.<br /><br />I certainly don't regret reading \\"The Affair\\", but have more to say in my attached comment.
B008476HBM|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful work.  It is actually quite hilarious at times, especially when looking at it through the lens of today.  A good read for all!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This gives you a good understanding of all that went into preparing to take down Bin Laden. It also shows the commitment of the Navy Seals.
B0011Z10PC|3.0|I really enjoyed the album American Idiot.  It's a 5 star album to me, despite all the hate derived from all the praise.  Like it or not, it's going to be one of the defining albums of 2000-2010 era. Chris Lord-Alge is the master of making power chords sound epic...<br /><br />However, Amazon consolidates the original 13 tracks into 9.  The tracks Holiday/Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Are We the Waiting/St. Jimmy, Give Me Novacaine/She's a Rebel, Extraordinary Girl/Letterbomb, are all combined. Meaning you have to listen them together.  Bleh...
B001QVFDA4|5.0|Gerard Butler and Tom Hardy make the movie! I have already watched it several times, def a must see movie!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I made the big mistake of starting this book after returning from an extended vacation and at a time when I really needed to get back into my daily life.  This book takes you to an alternative universe that, for me, is as addictive as chocolate.  Couldn't put it down for days, and since it's very long, it took that long to read it.  Never having read a Stephen King novel before, I had no idea of his rich understanding of characters, places, and interweaving of stories.  Even though the plot had many threads twisting together, I never lost my way and he never dropped a stitch in his telling of this fantastic yarn.  I plan to read lots of his other works just as soon as I pay my bills and do some laundry!

B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I pre-ordered this boxed set from amazon 5 months ago as I am a fan of this series and especially Harrison Ford. My total cost was $73 USD and I have watched only the first 2 so far.  There were 5 BD disks including the bonus disk.  The 2 movies I watched had no commentary and the theatrical trailers were the only additional features on those 2 disks.  The bonus Blu-ray and had the \\"makings\\" of the 4 movies and \\"on the set of the lost arc\\".  It would have been better if some commentaries by the actors were on the individual disks.  There were no digital or DVD backups provided but I had no problem cloning to BD-R.  The packaging could have been a lot better.  The artwork was very nice but there was no easy way to remove the disks from the cardboard sleeve without smudging the recorded surface.  A hole or V-cut would have made it easy to remove but would conflict with the pretty artwork due to the packaging design.  I smudged an interior disk attempting to extract and it would not play properly till I cleaned it.  For comparison, my Lord of the Rings extended version had 15 easy to remove disks with 6 Blu-ray and 9 DVDs and a much better presentation box at $108 USD.  I think this boxed set is way overpriced but if you are a fan of this series you will buy it as I did.

B000NQRE1E|1.0|Just tried to play the movie on my LG Blu-Ray player and was disappointed since it got hung up while trying to start the main menu.  Let it try multiple times for over 15 minutes but got nowhere.  Not what I expected from a mainstream movie right out of the box.  Will try on my son's player.  If it doesn't play, I'm just going to return it.  The DVD version seems OK (just watched about an hour of it) but the Blu-Ray Special Features disc also glitches a bit.  Not exactly what I spent the extra money for to get the Blu-Ray edition.
1471100480|4.0|It is this years release of the movie based on The Perks of Being a Wallflower that has reignited interest in the novel of the same name. First published 13 years ago, the book unfolds in an epistolary format as Charlie writes letters to an anonymous 'friend' sharing his experience of his first year (10th grade) of high school.<br /><br />Charlie is a bright but sensitive, socially awkward teenager coming of age in the early 1990's. The youngest child of a family that includes a college aged football hero, a rebellious teenage girl and loving but benign parents, there are hints that Charlie's past has been difficult, contributing to his almost childlike approach to life.<br />Shunned by his peer group, but encouraged by his English teacher, Bill, to participate in life Charlie takes a gamble when he strikes up a friendship with step brother and sister, Patrick and Sam, both in their final year of school. Endearingly naive, Charlie becomes a mascot of sorts for their group who are both amused and charmed by his quirks and who take it upon themselves to educate him. Charlie's thoughts and experiences of that time are relayed in the letters to his anonymous 'friend'.<br /><br />With Charlie, Chbosky explores the issues common to teens such as peer acceptance, emerging sexuality and risk taking behaviour as they discover who they are and try to find their place in their world. The Perks of Being a Wallflower can be confronting at times as all the terrors of high school are compressed into the experiences of one small group of students who deal with suicide, bullying, rape, homophobia, drug abuse and more. Charlie's naivete though provides a slightly different perspective on those universal struggles of adolescents as he tries to understand the unwritten code of appropriate social behaviour. Though he is prone to extreme emotional reactions, Charlie relates his experiences, and the experiences of his friends, with a sense of innocent detachment, accepting the mistakes, missteps and strangeness of his journey with remarkable equanimity.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is written for a mature teen audience who will be able to relate to the characters and their anxieties. This is a moving, funny and inspiring novel about growing up and moving on.issteps and strangeness of his journey with remarkable equanimity.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is written for a mature teen audience who will be able to relate to the characters and their anxieties.

0307591549|5.0|I typically take on a skeptical stance when it comes to self-help books - but the principles of this book and the way they were explained helped to convince me that I should work at being happy.  The principles are definitely all common sense - just really fleshed out with research, stats, etc.  But it's Shawn who makes you want to take that common sense and act on it to unleash the power the principles have toward positive transformation.

0812974786|5.0|I knew  I was in for a magical, mystery ride when  hysterical Tom Robbin's wrote in his Introduction about Siddhartha -\\"...not knowing- or not caring-which side his bread is BUDDHAED on.\\" Tom beautifully prepares the water as Susan Bernofsky, in her eloquent, yet simple, translation reveals the flower.  Like the pedals of a lotus  blossom unfolding, Siddhartha is  beautifully captured  in each step -each a new beginning toward his  search and ultimate surrender to The Divine.  Yes, I was supposed to have read Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse 45 years ago -  for my introductory Psych 1A class with Professor Clifton Fadiman at Brandeis University. But it never happened.  It was only now, at age 62, after losing my sister, Junie to colon cancer, that I was meant to go to the local Huntington library and obtain Susan's  wonderful and wondrous rendition of the classic.  And for that blessing, I thank  you Susan, & Tom, and Hermann.

1439199388|4.0|The \\"Hygiene Hypothesis\\" has been around a long time, but I certainly have never encountered such a complete explanation of it before this book!  As the other reviewers have said, basically the author's argument is that humans evolved with so many parasites and commensal bacteria and other organisms that our immune systems function with them.  And when we live in such a \\"clean\\" environment that they are cleared from our bodies our immune systems misfire, causing allergies, at the least, and autoimmune dysfunction at the worst.  It is a powerful argument, especially for anyone considering having children ... the message I took from the book was expose them to as much as possible before age 2 -- other children, crowded subways, farm animals, the mass of humanity that so many of us try to shield young children from!<br /><br />The second argument of the book is that re-habitation by our former passengers, parasites, might be used to treat or cure autoimmune diseases like MS, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc is equally compelling, and the author goes so far as to infect himself with hookworm.<br /><br />The only place his argument was not particularly compelling was trying to tie the hygiene hypothesis to cancer ... the chapter did not convince me, though I learned quite a bit from it.<br /><br />Finally, I would encourage all parents of autistic children to read this book.  Whether or not you buy his argument that autism is partly an autoimmune dysfunction it doesn't hurt to try some of the things he (and others) suggest, particularly the gluten free diet that has proven so remarkably effective in autistic children.

B008PALH0E|4.0|Having been present for the Mahler cycle that occupied Los Angeles and Gustavo Dudamel and the LA Phil as well as the Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela at the beginning of this year and was immediately followed by all troops descending on Caracas Venezuela for an instant replay of that cycle, it is interesting to see the difference in approach between the two cities.  When Dudamel and masses performed the Mahler 8th at the grossly ugly and acoustically dreadful Shrine Auditorium in Los Angles the performance sounded under rehearsed and loud and uneven on the part of both the orchestras and the massive choruses and the soloists. It is nice to report that this performance in Caracas that was broadcast in movie theaters across the country is a better version than the disappointing Los Angeles version.<br /><br />The DVD captures a travelogue type atmosphere of the performance and the visual aspects of the production are acceptable.  Everything is big and oversized and again under rehearsed, but the mighty choral forces are the Coro Sinf&oacute;nico Juvenil Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var de Venezuela, Schola Cantorum de Venezuela, Schola Juvenil de Venezuela and the Ni&ntilde;os Cantores de Venezuela show a lot of enthusiasm if not refinement. The soloists are the same mixed bag from the Los Angeles performance - Manuela Uhl, Julianna Di Giacomo, Anna Larsson, Charlotte Hellekant, Burkhard Fritz, Brian Mulligan, Alexander Vinogradov, and Kiera Duffy.<br /><br />This is not a definitive performance or a particularly insightful one: Dudamel seems to have solid ideas but it will take more than two performances of this huge work to bring it all together. Hopefully when he repeats it in the future he will not assemble the `symphony of 1000 +' that we see and hear on this very PR oriented DVD. Simply a well rehearsed, polished, dramatic performance with much smaller forces would likely allow Dudamel to realize his approach to the work. On the DVD, at the end of the performance, there is a lengthy `insight' talk with Dudamel and samples from both orchestras that serve to amplify and to polish the popularity of the event for the public.  The concept was solid; the results make a great show, but a great Mahler 8 this is not.

B008KOMMTA|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. I could write an entire thing of why and disprove the hate on it, but I'm gonna talk about the box set.<br />It comes in an amazing box, looks and has a great feel. It opens from the top revealing the case with an amazing slip cover. The slip cover artwork is my favorite of any release of this movie. There are neat little added things from artwork of the consumes to news from the time.<br />The box is sturdy and feels like it holds together and not cheap.<br />The 3D is very well done and not annoying to where it takes away from the movie. It adds to certain scenes while others not as much. But any case of 3D or not, this collection is amazing and is worth the buy
0345472322|4.0|Author, Carol Dweck is a well known researcher in the cognitive learning field. Normally, writing for academic journals, she says she was prompted by her students to write about her research in this popular psychology book. The main theme of the book is that when it comes to learning new skills, there are two kinds of thinking. One type of thinking causes us to give up more easily in the face of difficulty. The other causes us to embrace learning as a way to overcome further obstacles.<br /><br />I did not like that sometimes Dweck uses cherry picked anecdotes, especially when writing about performance in the sports field. For example, she writes about the tennis player John McEnroe and his bad behavior, which Dweck claims, is caused by his fixed mindset. How does she know this? There are many explanations for McEnroe's terrible behavior. Apparently, Dweck bases her conclusions about him merely on his biography. That is not science. She is not a psychiatrist. Another example; Dweck uses companies in the book, \\"Good to Great\\" as examples of companies with CEO's that have a growth mindset that have led to success. However, as of 2012, several of the \\"Good to Great\\" companies have gone bankrupt or have received bailout money from the U.S. government. In fact, as a group these \\"growth mindset\\" companies have underperformed the general market. I'm sure her publisher put her up to that kind of loose writing in order to keep the interest of the 'target audience'. Unfortunately, this kind of writing is typical of pop-psychology books and is misleading to the reader.<br /><br />In choosing a rating for the book, I gave Mindset the benefit of the doubt because I am relying on Dweck's extensive knowledge and research in the field. That is, I trust what she has to say and think its useful, even though she sometimes wanders away from scientific rigor. To be fair, she does give citations to research she and others have done to support her case.<br /><br />The book is quite repetitive in its thesis. We don't really learn a whole lot more by the end of the book then we did after the first 50 pages.<br /><br />Strategies on how to improve conversations with children on the subject is covered, but I wish Mindset had more cognitive strategies on how to develop a \\"growth\\" mindset in adults.  Still, just being aware of the growth mindset could be a help to those of us who encounter difficulties during the learning process.<br /><br />Well worth a read and especially parents with school-age children. You may do better however, by finding and reading her more scholarly works, if you are so inclined.

I did not realize the training that these military men/women go through on a daily basis to fight for our country.

B000000OAH|5.0|Queen had proven itself as a multi-talented, genre-defying, classical rock band from Hell that sounds like Heaven, with Shear Heart Attack, A Day At The Races, and beyond anyone's doubts with A Night At The Opera. They had conquered the mainstream with We Are The Champions and have become one of the most played songs in history at sports venues around the globe with Brian May's We Will Rock You. They certainly had nothing to prove with their next album, Jazz,  but again the quartet excelled beyond description and expectations with this often underrated work. Bicycle Race and Fat-Bottomed Girls proved commercial enough for the Top 40, yet ecclectic enough not to tarnish the reputation of one of the best bands ever to exist. Songs like In Only Seven Days, and Leaving Home Ain't Easy showed their melodic romantic skills off in a way that made it look easy. Still using no synthesizers, Queen was a group of four geniuses, who fortunately united to bring us an experience in the audio arts that is rivalled only  by the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and a few others. There is good, there is great, and there is Queen.

159420411X|5.0|This is the best general-readership book on applied statistics that I've read. Short review: if you're interested in science, economics, or prediction: read it. It's full of interesting cases, builds intuition, and is a readable example of Bayesian thinking.<br /><br />Longer review: I'm an applied business researcher and that means my job is to deliver quality forecasts: to make them, persuade people of them, and live by the results they bring. Silver's new book offers a wealth of insight for many different audiences. It will help you to develop intuition for the kinds of predictions that are possible, that are not so possible, where they may go wrong, and how to avoid some common pitfalls.<br /><br />The core concept is this: prediction is a vital part of science, of business, of politics, of pretty much everything we do. But we're not very good at it, and fall prey to cognitive biases and other systemic problems such as information overload that make things worse. However, we are simultaneously learning more about how such things occur and that knowledge can be used to make predictions better -- and to improve our models in science, politics, business, medicine, and so many other areas.<br /><br />The book presents real-world experience and critical reflection on what happens to research in social contexts. Data-driven models with inadequate theory can lead to terrible inferences. For example, on p. 162: \\"What happens in systems with noisy data and underdeveloped theory - like earthquake prediction and parts of economic and political science - is a two-step process. First, people start to mistake the noise for a signal. Second, this noise pollutes journals, blogs, and news accounts with false alarms, undermining good science and setting back our ability to understand how the system really works.\\" This is the kind of insight that every good practitioner acquires through hard-won battles, and continues to wrestle every day both in doing work and in communicating it to others.<br /><br />It is both readable and technically accurate: it presents just enough model details yet avoids being formula-heavy. Statisticians will be able to reproduce models similar to the ones he discusses, but general readers will not be left out: the material is clear and applicable. Scholars of all stripes will appreciate the copious notes and citations, 56 pages of notes and another 20 pages of index, which detail the many sources. It is also important to note that this is perhaps the best general readership book from a Bayesian perspective -- a viewpoint that is overdue for readable exposition.<br /><br />The models cover a diversity of areas from baseball to politics, from earthquakes to finance, from climate science to chess. Of course this makes the book fascinating to generalists, geeks, and breadth thinkers, but perhaps more importantly, I think it serves well to develop reusable intuition across domains. And, for those of us who practice such things professionally, to bring stories and examples that we can tell and use to illustrate concepts with the people we inform.<br /><br />There are three audiences who might not appreciate the book as much. First are students looking for a how-to book. Silver provides a lot of pointers and examples, but does not get into nuts and bolts details or supply foundational technical instruction. That requires coursework in research methods and and statistics. Second, his approach to doing multiple models and interpreting them humbly will not satisfy those who promote a naive, gee-whiz, \\"look how great these new methods are\\" approach to research. But then, that's not a problem; it's a good thing. The third non-fitting audience will be experts who desire depth in one of the book's many topic areas; it's not a technical treatise for them and I can confidently predict grumbling in some quarters. Overall, those three audiences are small, which happily leaves the rest of us to enjoy the book.<br /><br />What would make it better? As a pro, I'd like a little more depth (of course). It emphasizes games a little too much for my taste. And a clearer prescriptive framework could be nice (but also could be a problem for reasons he illustrates). But those are minor points; it hits its target better than any other such book I know.<br /><br />Conclusion: if you're interested in scientific or statistical forecasting, either as a professional or layperson, or if you simply enjoy general science books, get it. Cheers!ake it better? As a pro, I'd like a little more depth (of course). It emphasizes games a little too much for my taste.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|On the service/product: This worked out great, no spelling errors or any such mishaps. The product was delivered to my kindle shortly after me ordering it and it worked out beautifully.<br /><br />On the story: This book was marvelous. It was comparable to Hitchhiker's Guide in style, but it had a much more mature message. Intended for mature, intelligent, and active readers, as its got some very confusing structural bits that can be tricky to understand if you aren't very savvy with such things. It might help to read it with a friend or two. I had a teacher and classmates that helped me understand some parts. It was a very sad book about Billy Pilgrim's adventures through time in the WWII bombing of Dresden and his intermittent adventures to Tralfamadore. Enjoy the read, not often do you get a book full to the brim with medicine that tastes this sweet.

B007THA4FI|1.0|Okay, so I haven't read the whole book.  Just like if I step in dog doodoo I don't need to get down and roll around in it, the first sample chapters of Rowlings' new book told me that it isn't something I'm eager to read.  You can decide for yourself whether it is an astounding step forward in her writing career or simply an astounding step.  For the price you will pay for this book, be sure you are going to enjoy it and there is doubt on that topic.<br /><br />The tenor of many reviews of this work is that it is unrelentingly grim and without hope.  Rowling employs lots of four letter words and four letter verbs to prove she is writing for the adult reader, but the most important four letter word requisite in reading dour and dark works is missing (hope).  In the sample chapters there isn't ONE redeemable character.  I personally suspect Rowling spent a bit too much time in the past five years immersed in works like \\"Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" and has therefore spewed forth a novel that runs along the same \\"humanity is violent, especially the men and we are all s--t\\" lines.<br /><br />So take advantage of one of Kindle's strongest features to download a sample and read it.  If you still care about what is happening in Rowling's new world, go ahead and buy the book.  I don't want to credit this work by putting my money behind it.

0547569653|2.0|I would actually rate the book 2.5 stars, if possible.  I am a distance runner (marathons), and what I found to be most helpful are the tales of suffering and that pain and delirium can be survived by runners who are adequately prepared.  What I'm still on the fence about, however, is the vegan thing.  I am not a vegatarian, but I rarely eat beef.  When I do eat meat, it's usually fish or poultry. Scott may very well benefit from a vegan diet, but, if I were a betting man, I would gamble that the impact on his performance is marginal at best.  It could very well be that the advantage he enjoys as a vegan is a placebo-effect.  Some data on this question would have been helpful.

B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This is a very well written book that I really enjoyed - at least the first 75% or so.  The author did a great job, but the editors did not!  In the last part of the book, either the author became very lazy (which I doubt) or the editors were sleeping on the job.<br /><br />The first part flows very well, is easy to follow and a great read.  The last part, however, has lots of errors: spelling errors, sentences that are chopped off in the middle or combined with another, words randomly added or deleted, etc.  It also becomes very, very choppy and seems to have chunks of it randomly deleted.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this book, but the ending kind of ruined it for me (the editing, not the story!).  Whomever at Amazon edited this book needs to be reassigned to the mail room, the book needs to be re-edited and issued in its entirety.  Anyone who purchased this kindle version should get the re-issued version for free.  The editors at Amazon truly did this author a disservice.<br /><br />THIS IS A GREAT BOOK AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT - BUT BUY THE PAPERBACK, NOT THE KINDLE VERSION.

No matter how I tried, I could not listen to this book while driving because it put me to sleep!  Finally I had to change to another book in order to keep driving!  I did finish the book out of sheer determination once I got to my destination, but it never got any better.  It was so dry and detailed abot the Russian revolution and the Bolshevikts, that it was more like a documentary or history textbook.  What a shame to waste so much time and money on a book that is such a disappointment.

B008PCVGKI|5.0|It is a common claim among alt med cranks that skeptics are only critical of alternative medicine. This is not and has never been true - most of [[ASIN:0865479186 Bad Science]] is about \\"Big Pharma\\" and its shenanigans, but this latest book by Ben Goldacre goes a lot further.<br /><br />In \\"Bad Pharma\\" you will read about the ways in which vested interests bamboozle us and our doctors, whether by accident or design. You will find out why the benefits of most medicines are overstated, and why the systematic review is incredibly important. You will become, in short order, very angry indeed, and then you will be told what you can do about that anger - whether you are a patient or a doctor.<br /><br />Goldacre's style is engaging and informal, and he is a practising doctor. The books include anecdotes about how he himself has unknowingly prescribed drugs which are not just ineffective, but worse than doing nothing - despite having read the research evidence with a particularly critical eye. All the data and references are there if you need them but they don't derail the narrative, so the book functions both as a reference and as an eminently readable story.<br /><br />This is my pick for best book of the year so far, and one of the most important books most of us will have read. This is about your health. Get informed, get angry and get active!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Very well written.   Keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  Just when you think you have it figured out, something changes.  You will not want to put this down!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you want the true story without any “political correctness“ this is the book for you. Makes me proud to be an American.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Didn't want it to end. A very good read! Hard to put down. Hope it's true and not a piece of fiction. Well written.
1468161660|5.0|this is one of those books that you see has over five star reviews and u skip and skip and then finally and wonder why you did not get sooner. the book is amazing i bought part two before i finished the first one, i knew right away i was going to need to follow this love story.... if you have not read you must get it.
B0076HLKO0|5.0|Even the most casual Foo Fighters fan will appreciate how detailed this documentary was. From Grohl's start with Nirvana, to the Foo's early turmoil, and ending on a high note as one of the greatest rock bands of all time, you will be both informed and captivated by their story. Very well done and well worth the price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very fun and entertaining game. I love it and so does my four year old little boy. I highly recommend it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. don't what I would do if I did have it cuz I keep forgetting to charge it up. just love it
B00006JIA4|5.0|Contains all great songs of Queen.<br />But some songs are edited, like the song \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", and the song \\"Flash\\" it's different from the album version.<br />But lacking 1 nice song \\"Love of my Life\\" , which is not included.
B008NW67E0|3.0|I am not sure that this album has the same catch that the first album had. There are several tracks which seem to be incredibly similar with each other or on tracks from Sigh no more. Was expecting the guys to have moved it on a bit and its just not there for me. Still not a bad album though.
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|Awesom, second fav next to saving private Ryan and then platoon. Love the soundtrack as well. Pic quality of the Bluray is real clean as well.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a great Book and a easy read. I couldn't put it down. Finished it in two days. I would reccomend this book to everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recomend to everyone i could. absolutly loved this book hope to read again in the near by future
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this is the best game every when I had first started this it got me amazed. this is the best game every
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is quite addicting and fun. I just wish that the coins regenerated faster than they do. it's worth a try
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|I enjoyed the story overall. It is the first book in the series, and it feels like the author is a bit timid with the characters. A decent read, and it does get better in the second book!
B004IJY4L0|5.0|This album is not only fun to listen to, but is a well-engineered audio masterpiece.  Initially I enjoyed it from the standpoint of \\"listener,\\" but soon realized it serves as a master class in mixing and audio production.  Even if you don't like the style of music, you will get something out of Immersion!
B006O7XOOW|3.0|If you're a parent with two kids, you probably already have a lot of toys at home.  But you jump at the chance to expose them to something new.  The Fisher-Price Stand-Up Ballcano sounded like something intriguing that they might like, so I took the chance and requested it for review.<br /><br />I confess, when the box arrived, I was a little disappointed to find that not only did it take some assembly, but 4 double A batteries to work.  Still, not that problematic.  Most of the assembly is fairly basic, but putting in the screws that attache the legs to the base is a bit difficult. (They recommend putting the item down on a flat surface, but since the top of the base isn't flat, it's hard to get the screws to attach both plastic pieces without having a third hand to hold the snap on pieces together.  Once it was assembled and the batteries were put in, we were ready to try it out.<br /><br />Well,my son (who is almost 4) eagerly played with it for about a half hour that first day.  He hasn't touched it for more than a minute since.  My daughter (who is a year and half) occasionally explores the toy, but has more interest in the six colorful plastic balls that come with it.  The toy itself has three large plastic legs with small pockets on the bottom.  The top consists of three ramps that lead the balls to one of the legs and a middle section where you place the balls.  When the spinner attached to the center is turned slightly, the \\"ballcano\\" portion lowers down slightly and then raises enough to send the balls off the center platform and onto the ramps where they make their way to the pockets on the lets.  Oh, and it plays music and lights flash briefly while it does this.<br /><br />Now normally, I prefer simple toys where the kids can use their imaginations to enliven the play.  But . . .  this thing is huge.  It takes up as much room as some of the play centers, or a small baby walker might.  The legs do not fold up and it's impossibly hard to store anywhere.  And all it does is what I described above?  Please!  For a monstrosity of this size I want some more bells and whistles.  Something that will keep my kids occupied for more than a few minutes.  Something worth the amount of space and batteries.<br /><br />Added into this is that the toy doesn't really work well.  Most of the balls, when they tumble off the ramp, rather than falling into the shallow pockets on the legs, roll off onto the floor.  I'm amazed I can still find four of the six balls . . . not sure where the other two have gone.  And the volcano type action? meh.  Folks, I hate to say it, but this is a one trick pony sort of toy that's a huge space hog.  There are better, more interesting toys out there.  Toys that not only interest kids more but take up less space and store easier.  To be fair, the toy appears to be fairly strong and maybe a younger child would have more fun for longer with it, but I'm not sold on it.<br /><br />Happy playing! ^_^ ShanshadAnd all it does is what I described above?

B008476HBM|3.0|The Bennet sisters Elizabeth and Jane are of age to court and find a spouse.  Elizabeth find one person in particular that she will never court, Fitzwilliam Darcy, or will his charming ways find their way into her heart.<br /><br />This book is suppose to be humorous.  I did not find anything funny or remotely interesting, well until Darcy came along.  In all truthness I can not see how this book has gotten so many other books based on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth.  I don't get it.  I wish I did.  I wanted to like this so much more than I did.  All I could see the book is about is dancing and gossip.  It reminds me of a older version of Seinfeld because it was about nothing.  I did not give diddly squat about anybody in this book.  Yes it is written pretty and well done but I had no connection to the people.<br />You are probably wondering why I would give any stars if I dislike it so much but the truth is certain moments caught my attention and as I said it is written pretty.  I only thought it to be okay maybe a little less than that.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Love this game....like how you can change tiles and background.  It helps me unwind after a long day!!  Great for memory.  My 4 yr old loves to help me.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I've always liked jigsaw puzzles but they take up space on your table.  I like that I can do puzzles anywhere I want.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|this movie is great! tons of action...great chemistry between the actors...excellent story. thought id be burned out on these comicbook movies by now but The Avengers re-ignited the fun for me.<br /><br />i pre-ordered the 3D Blu-ray 4 disc dvd even though i do not have a 3D capable system - yet. got the disc early on tuesday morning and after a couple of viewings, i cant wait to spend more money upgrading my theater system to 3D. however, my point for this review is that i paid $30 for the movie and amazon is reimbursing me $10 because of a price drop? normally i wouldnt care about that, especially if its a product im really enjoying - money well spent. but that just goes to show what kind of class amazon has. thats why i shop here more than any other outlet/online store. thx amazon!
B007TK77QE|1.0|I would love to buy this book but it is too expensive! I find it hard to comprehend why I will be able to but this book cheaper in a soft cover version.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great for sitting in a waiting room.  It's fun without having to concentrate on it.  So much like the Vagas type games .
B0018PH3L0|5.0|One of the greatest westerns ever made !!!!!!! The cast is unbelievable. I recently bought this DVD because the movie was playing on television and couldn't watch it with commercials .... great great great movie
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I loved this app until the new permissions came out. If there is a worse app out there spyware wise I haven't seen it. Why would I want them to be able to access my camera, make unauthorized calls, read and write to my calender. This gives them the ability to listen in on, as well as see,  everything you do. As much as I liked this app before I cannot recommend it and have since deleted it.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Honestly, I was blown away with the 3D in this movie! The 3D is almost as good as the 3D in Avatar. I have seen quite a few movies in 3D and this is my second all time favorite so far. It really draws you in and makes you feel like you are in the movie. It makes it look & feel so much more realistic. If you love 3d movies then you have to see this one! Can't wait until the next one!!

B0083SBMBM|4.0|Marvel Comics' \\"The Avengers\\" brings together 7 superheroes, 4 of whom have had their own films, to combat a global threat. Scientists with the S.H.I.E.L.D. organization are trying to find an unlimited source of energy locked within an alien Tesseract. But it is emitting unusual energy surges, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), errant brother of the Asgardian Thor, comes through the Tesseract from \\"the other end of space\\". Using his scepter, Loki forcibly converts Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and Agent Clint \\"Hawkeye\\" Barton (Jeremy Renner) to his cause and absconds with the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) assembles the extraordinary individuals to form the Avengers, at Director Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) request. Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Dr. David \\"Hulk\\" Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must prevent Loki from bringing an alien army to conquer Earth.<br /><br />It seems that, with so many superheroes in play, there must be a comparably grandiose enemy. Loki personifies foolish ambition, but he is being used by the otherworldly leader of the alien armies, who happens to look like the Grim Reaper. The fight is over Earth, in its entirety. \\"The Avengers\\" runs too long at 2 hours 23 minutes, but that is almost inevitable given the need to introduce so many characters to an audience who may not be familiar with them. I've only seen 4 of these characters in a movie before, but I could gather enough about the others over the course of \\"The Avengers\\" that I was not lost. It's a challenge for director Joss Whedon to get enough backstory, character development, and action into theatrical movie with 8 larger-than-life characters. And this was only his second feature film. Whedon is, or was, a television writer and director who became involved in the project through a long-standing friendship with producer Kevin Feige.<br /><br />The Avengers spend too much time fighting technical difficulties and fighting each other -for reasons which are, at best, weak- rather than fighting the enemy. When that giant aircraft carrier that S.H.I.E.L.D. uses as a base ascends into the sky, well, one could guess that it might have trouble staying there. Is this really something our superheroes should spend their energies on? Some of those action sequences were not integrated well enough into the story: action for the sake of action. \\"The Avengers\\" is not perfect. But Mark Ruffalo is the best Dr. David Banner yet. He is a man who has mastered the art of calm, reluctantly, because he holds passionate views. He copes well with the constant threat of Hulk but is always in conflict with himself. Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson is a strong character but also brings an indispensable \\"everyman\\" perspective to the superhero show. Robert Downey, Jr. is always entertaining as Tony Stark. \\"The Avengers\\" has a lot of territory to cover with these characters, and it generally succeeds and entertains, with good humor.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2012 single disc edition): There are 2 bonus features on the single disc edition. \\"Assembling the Ultimate Team\\" (8 min) interviews director Joss Whedon and the actors about characters and casting. There is an audio commentary by Joss Whedon which is constant and informative. He talks about locations, story structure, challenges of shooting, conveying the Marvel universe on film, what he put in versus what he left out, writing while shooting, his decisions, and scene-by scene commentary. Dubbing is available for the film in French, Spanish, and English Descriptive Video Service. Subtitles are available in French, Spanish, and English.difficulties and fighting each other -for reasons which are, at best, weak- rather than fighting the enemy.

B008ASLK8A|5.0|Expecting this sequel to be as disappointing as all sequels,  I have to say that I was rather pleased with this installment. It was entertainingly funny, dramatic, & the special effects were pretty awesome. They used some really neat camera effects that I think are becoming the new \\"thing\\" in fantasy/action movies such as this and \\"Abraham Lincoln,  Vampire Hunter\\", etc.  Robert Downey Junior was great as a quirky, cross-dressing, embalming fluid drinking, butt-kicking  Sherlock Holmes & Jude Law was fabulous as his Jimminy Cricketlike backup with a bang, Dr. Watson. The plot roled along nicely from start to finish leaving me actually clapping at the end.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Amazing ending to an amazing series. If you have read the first 2 books than this is an obviously a must read because it reveals everything. --reviewed by high school freshmen
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|My wife and I were big fans of the Muppets when we were younger and we were excited that they made a new movie.  Unfortunately, we missed it in the theatre but several of our friends had positive things to say about it so I bought a copy for my wife.<br /><br />We enjoyed watching it and our 10 month old really liked the songs as well.  It's a fun film, certainly not life changing, but it could turn a bad day around if you throw it on to watch.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I had seen the movie before, but wanted my daughter and granddaughter to see it.  It arrived in a timely fashion and was in excellent condition.  I am very satisfied with the product and the service.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|It is obvious that Mr. Martin became tired of writing this series as this book was hastily written and lacked the passion and intricate framework of the previous books in this series.  What a huge disappointment as he hastily killed characters, left stories dangling and created more questions than answers.  Very, very disappointing.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Really an excellent read.  It went very quickly and was entertaining throughout.  I will definitely read the rest of the series.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I didn't expect much due to the reviews but I at least thought it would be visually interesting. A lackluster boring waste of time.
B00009AOBI|5.0|The movie was exactly what I wanted.  The director's cut had footage not originally seen and added to my satisfaction with the movie.  Shipped on time with no problems at all, as promised!  Thanks!
B008JEJVXG|5.0|Every so often there are bands that take popular sounds and really hit it out of the park. Reverb, low-fi, and dream pop are pretty common these days in the indie world. And like most music of any genre, there are loads of bands that get it wrong and are obviously faking it, and then there's a select few that just plain get it. Whether blissful or melancholy, you won't lose interest in Nocturne. One of my favorites this year so far.
B00005JSGK|5.0|This is the only John Wayne movie that I can watch over and over.  I've never wanted to go to Africa but after watching this, it just might be something to add to my bucket list.
B008B11R1Q|4.0|This album by XX maintains some of the same themes as their debut. Songs that pull out emotion with the slightest touch, whether pleasure or pain. What i like about the band is that they didn't just re-create their last album. Don't get me wrong, i loved XX, but rehashing a sound doesn't allow the band to grow as artists, and honestly, it bores fans if its just the same thing repeating itself. Kudos to XX for tweaking their sound and still releasing a solid album.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|the author did expand the topic of killing Osama a bit but by and large it was not an exciting read. There was too much repetition of how Seals are trained etc. OK but no cigar.
B0099G3I96|4.0|It's about time for cryin' out loud! Gwen & Co's got their pep and mojo back and unleash it on the new album. Longtime fans won't be disappointed. The album has the standard bearer pop anthems and delicious gems mixed in that you probably won't hear on the radio. They don't capture the magic of Tragic Kingdom, but it's still a fun pop sound.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I have done some hiking on the Appalachian Trail so I was curious to see how the author faired. She didn't have much experience in hiking and especially not solo. She started out by overloading her backpack and could scarcely get it off the ground and on her back.I have had that experience.  Then she couldn't stand up straight.  Luckily, several chapters later she meets some experienced hikers (men) and they teach her how to travel light.  I'm not finished but am looking forward to see how she survives mentally and physically.  My Kindle [[ASIN:B008LFKUNS Ten Shades of Sexy]]tells me I'm only 33% done so I have to get busy.  I am enjoying the book which I bought from Amazon..  [[ASIN:B000H94PDW High Sierra Access Backpack]]
B008C1O8CA|4.0|It's not often that a band can take a formula and make it work again and again. Uno is certainly geared closer in sound to their older albums, although it doesn't recreate the magic of Dookie. I like that they don't have much in the way of \\"Statements\\" that were in American Idiot (which was a classic). A couple songs run together, but overall a really fun, snarky, in-your-face rock album as sung by your irresistible shi**y brat brothers. Worth a buy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the first Suzanne Collins book that I've read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Ms. Collins keeps her readers engaged from start to finish.  Can't wait to see the movie version.
B004CIIXC8|5.0|I just want to add a few thoughts to the already thorough reviews here.<br />If you haven't seen the film, do so. This is the sort of film that will be studied in film courses.<br />This is how it's done. This isn't a film to see with popcorn and friends.<br />This is art.<br />This is Art without being in danger of pretension or the self service of trying too hard to be 'Art'.<br />There's a reason it was inducted into the Criterion collection the same year it came out.<br />Great photography, acting, pacing, directing, restraint, writing, editing, music - and heart.<br />The film is about truth and bleakness and love - and the struggle to be free.<br />And when light does finally come through, it's made all the more powerful because of the darkness.<br />The ending with the three women together is understated, powerful and masterful.<br />It reminds me of the ending in City Lights, although not on the same level I suppose,<br />but with the same sentiment and grace and artistry.<br />This film may not be for everybody.<br />Perhaps it's for those of us who live with suffering and beauty -<br />in equal measure.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Absolutely silly to pay $18 for a file download.  Greedy! Greedy! Greedy!  Shame on you... There is just one file, already produced (and not well based on other reviews).  Cost pennies to send.... I refuse to buy and so should others.  Send a message!
B00701QVVY|5.0|Really...THE ELECTRIC AGE is one of the best albuns from the GREAT OVERKILL!!!! The allucinated vocals of Blitz are AMAZING, and the band destroy everything with great inspired HEAVY tunes!!!! ONE OF THE BEST, in par with YEARS OF DECAY, HORRORSCOPE and IRONBOUND!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you like OVERKILL!!!! WELL DONE!!!!!!!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|The game so far has been fun, but the controls to move your character can be a little bit hard to use.
B0073O8BOS|5.0|So the title song [[ASIN:B0073O8BYI Sweet Sour]] is on the current radio rotation on a number of stations and it was enough for me to look into the band.  I listened the 30 second blurb you get and it was enough for me to get the album.  When I went to get the album I saw that their first album [[ASIN:B006X7LJUO Baby Darling Doll Face Honey]] was also available and got them both at the same time.  This band is so incredible it blows me away.  Every song is different enough that it does not sound like you are just listening to an album but a playlist of artists on shuffle.  I have listened to these two albums so many times it is not even funny.  I play them at work, in my car, as ring tones, and everywhere I am I tell people about them.  If you are even thinking about it, stop thinking and just do it.  When you do it don't forget to get [[ASIN:B006X7LJUO Baby Darling Doll Face Honey]] at the same time.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the best movie in its genre. I enjoy most the super hero movies to some extent but this is the pinnacle.  I hope Joss Wheadon<br /> does another, after he does another Firefly movie of course.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this was a fun book to read. It's different from other books I've read and I thought it was well written. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it and couldn't wait to read it the next day. I loved it!
B000002L9S|5.0|The first atrack 'Papa Don't Preach' with its violin intro and powerful message has always been the most controversal song from Madonna and the most remember on this album.<br /><br />'Open Your Heart' never gets old and still encourages guys to be with tht girl they can't seem to ignore.<br /><br />'Live to Tell' is such a powerful ballad on the album and brings chills to anyone who listens to it.<br /><br />The title track speaks about finding true love and letting that person know straight up.<br /><br />'La Isla Bonita' speaks a lot about one missing their homeland, and what they wish for it in the near future. (Mnay people from thrid and fourth World countries I think relate a lot with this song.)<br /><br />'White Heat', 'Where's the Party?', and 'Jimmy Jimmy' don't do too bad on the album.<br /><br />'Love Makes the World Go Round' speaks for itself and isn't too bad.<br /><br />This was one of Madonna most beloved and popular albums of the 80s and proof that her success would still continue.
B004J00KJ8|3.0|I thought my TV was dirty, you see small dirt specks in the movie.  Bad Bad Bad.  Not a clean movie at all.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I purchased and read Mark Owen‘s  memoir because a dear friend was a SEAL during the  Vietnam era and I hoped it would enlighten me about Jerry‘s devotion to the crew.  I found the book shallow and offensive and, therefore, disappointing because of the shabby attitude Owen demonstrated toward the President.   Owen seems to have forgotten, or found Bush‘s declaration of the mission accomplished before thousands of members of our military.were killed in action.   Owen reveals himself to be.little more than a highly trained gun-totting  jock   who resents the fact that a democrat is in the White House.  he did the SEALS no good by writing this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am completely addicted. I play on my kindle fire and have not had a single glitch. I do have to wait for some items because I don't want to spend any money but there are plenty of things to do while waiting
0061122416|5.0|This book was recommended by my master sensei and it changed my life and the way I think. Very well written and straight to the point. It's not a hundred pages of nothing leading up to the ending. Anybody questioning their life's purpose should read this book. Anyone thinking of giving up on their dream should read this book. Godspeed!
0345803493|2.0|I actually haven't been able to finish the book yet, I had to take a break from it, it is that terrible.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very well constructed plot with plenty of twists and turns. I loved everything except the last 40 or so pages where too much was packed in and speculated.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it. fun to play and just like I pod and it is really funk to play trust me you will like
0345803485|2.0|I heard a lot about this book, so decided to buy it. It read like something from one of those cheap romance novels. It was awful. Was the so called \\"writer\\" of this trash, actually for real? And, I guess there is a trilogy. Now I remember why I stopped reading novels.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult, is on a role! From \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" to \\"The Pact\\" things just get better and better. The way she tells the characters stories, with such creative detail truly blows my mind. She is officially my #1 author of the year. If you haven't read this book yet, you are missing out on a whole world! A whole world, you cant afford to miss out on! Read \\"The Pact\\" today!! <3
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Before buying this version of the Blu-ray ask yourself a few questions:<br /><br />1) Do you know how to use a DVD drive to transfer your digital copy?  Check?  Okay you're still good.<br /><br />2) Do you appreciate a beautiful quality image and sound transfer?  Good, you are still good.<br /><br />3) Do you enjoy oft-missing features like Director's Commentary and Gag Reels?  Good, you are still good.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer of The Avengers is beautiful, the Gag Reel and Commentary are great, the digital download works just like EVERY OTHER Disney digital download, so if you understand how to hit eject and use a DVD drive you will be fine.  The two short featurettes *are* disappointing, yes, but they do not define the entire Blu-ray.  If you appreciate how gorgeous and fun this movie is then get it.  If you are looking for the most in-depth special features ever, go buy the Lord of the Rings movies instead.
B000N7KTBU|3.0|It's okay, I suppose. The build quality is better than most stand-alone enclosures, but I think that's saying more about how cheap most feel rather than how great you'll find the Transcend StoreJet. My primary portable HD is a LaCie Rikiki and the overall build quality on it is in a whole different league than this enclosure when completed with a drive.<br /><br />I bought this enclosure when I upgraded my MacBook Pro to an SSD as a way to reuse my existing 2.5\\" drive. And for the price, I'm fine with it. It's functional, just not fashionable.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Book one just okay. Book two a straight flow from book one to book two. Never reintroduced the characters. Too long, got bored.  Put the book down several times.  Sandra Brown and Nora Roberts write more challenging and entertaining books!  Yes, I bought book 3 I may read it, but there are too many other good authors to read first.

B008N5UX9M|5.0|This effort by Steve Harris is a throw back to Maiden's 70's proggy music influences. THIS IS NOT GOING TO SOUND LIKE A MAIDEN ALBUM, SO IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED! I like the songs. As some have stated, the vocals are probably the weakest part of the album but they aren't bad. A lot of the songs have a blues rock tempo, kind of a \\"rock steady\\" vibe. They are fun, short songs. One thing I would like to see Steve Harris take away from his solo effort is to get back to writing some shorter songs (ala Aces High) for Maiden. I love his 10 minute epics, but I would love to see him getting back to 4 -5 minute songs.<br /><br />Again, IMO this album is worth the investment. It's a solid rock album.

B008I3QZKU|1.0|This has got to be one of the most disappointing albums I have come across in a long time. The killers were a breath of fresh air in a time of pretty uninteresting music. Their first 3 albums were incredible. Each had a different sound, but hit the mark in their own way.  With Day and Age they started to move from power rock to techno rock.  It lacked the intensity of their past work. It was still a solid album, but made me worry about the direction they were heading.  Well, my worst fears were realized with Battle Born. The album is bland, sleepy and filled with sappy lyrics. Not one song stands out from another. I could barely make it through one listen.  Brandon Flowers has turned the Killers into the boring Vegas bar band he seems to admire so much. Sad to say, these guys are over and done with.
B009B50QOU|3.0|I've been a huge Green Day fan for years now.  Their early stuff is awesome and when they released Warning, while still a decent record, I thought they were on their way out.<br /><br />Then came American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, which were simply AMAZING.  Both musically, lyrically and of course being \\"rock opera's\\".<br /><br />I was highly anticipating this record (and the 2 to come), and it's just all right.  There are some great songs, Nuclear Family, Carpe Diem, Let yourself go, Angle Blue, but the rest just seem to be filler.  Not bad songs for the most part, just not great either.<br /><br />The one song, which is almost embarrassing is \\"Kill the DJ\\".  It's horrible....  I thought it might grow on my or something, but after listening to it several times, it get's worse each time versus better.  I don't know what they were thinking on that one.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|My rating: 4 of 5 stars<br /><br />\\"Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes\\" is the first book that I have read by Denise Grover Swank. It is not the kind of book that I typically would pick up and read and I absolutely cringed when I realized it was written in first person perspective. However, I decided to stick it out and give it a chance because I absolutely adore the person who referred the book to me! I have to say...I think this is the only book I've ever read in first person perspective that I got through without throwing it up against the wall in utter frustration.<br /><br />The voice of this book is a girl named Rose. A spunky southern girl who is a bit naive, okay, a lot naive and a little bit crazy...at least to her neighbors and her mother. Rose's mother is convinced her daughter is demon possessed. Why? Because, Rose isn't like everyone else...she has visions about the future. Nothing hugely prophetic, usually the visions are useless information that Rose can't help but blurt out such as someone locking their keys in their car or some other random slice of life.<br /><br />When Rose has a vision about dying, she decides that she is going to live her life out in a short amount of time. Whether her momma approves it or not! Unfortunately, her poor momma doesn't have much time to worry about her new found nerve. Momma takes Rose's place in her vision and the town suspects that Rose is the one who murdered her! Desperate to live her life before a new vision proves true for her (or before she goes to jail) Rose sets out to accomplish a list of twenty-eight wishes. Her wishes range from opportunities that she miss out on as a child, such as, \\"dress like a princess\\" to \\"find a boyfriend\\".<br /><br />On this journey of self-discovery we get to know Rose's sister, Violet, and a hunky neighbor named Joe who seems to be the answer to several wish-list criteria to the tune of \\"find a boyfriend\\". Something is suspicious about Joe and honestly, there were times I wanted to scream \\"RUUUUUUNN! And other times I desperately wanted him to be better than he appeared. I suppose an easy-peasy romance would be a very boring read so of course there had to be drama! And drama there was!!!<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, so.... I'm not going to spill all the details; you'll just have to read it for yourself. I did have just a few complaints... Since my own sister uses the term \\"crappy doodles\\" I could overlook it...the first few times. I felt it was overused in some places since Rose was \\"growing up\\" I thought maybe she would finally choose a new expletive word at some point. And then my second complaint...now I'm not too stuffy when it comes to curse words in books but I felt the f bomb was a little harsh for such a fun loving light read (well, if you can consider murder fun-loving--which I did for this story). I understand they were used by persons who would be more likely to use them but it still felt a little...forced.<br /><br />Overall, the story was well written and I think the author is one of the rare people who can actually write in first person perspective and do it well. The characters had an interesting voice on paper and a personality that kept me turning the pages to find out more!scream \\"RUUUUUUNN!

B006O2QNOU|2.0|Though Margin Call is advertised as a thriller, there's no suspense to be had.  Someone figures out the firm's mortgage-backed securities aren't secure at all.  They sit in offices having meetings for half the movie.  Then they initiate a banking collapse to save the firm.  Some people get fired.  Some don't.  Everyone comes out filthy rich.  The presence of a fine cast and suspenseful music can't bring a dead story to life, though they certainly try.<br /><br />If you're looking for excitement, look elsewhere.  If you're looking to understand the economic collapse, try NPR's Planet Money podcast.

030758836X|5.0|Ok, I have to admit I am not a huge Gillian Flynn fan.  In fact, I didn't like her novel Dark Objects very much.  But something prompted me to read Gone Girl, and I'm so glad I did.  This was one of those books that's like an addiction to something that you know is not good for you - the characters are deliberately unlikeable but you can't help reading on and on because you want to know what happens to them and what's making them tick, even though you get this unsettling feeling in your stomach while you're doing it because, heck, you just don't like these people at all.<br /><br />Flynn does a fabulous job of drawing in the reader, going back and forth from the husband's viewpoint and the wife's viewpoint.  And, whoa, what insights the reader gets with each of the main characters! The mystery is intriguing, but it's really the character development and psychological goings-on that are so superbly crafted that you just don't want to put the book down.  When I finished the book, my first thought was, \\"Wow, SOMEbody has GOT to make a movie out of this!\\"<br /><br />Brava, Ms. Flynn!

B00847UYWA|3.0|This series of stories is an early science-fiction/horror work first published in 1895. It was recommended by Stephen King in his history of horror, \\"Danse Macabre.\\" Despite its early date, the series is certainly science fiction: the first story projects the setting to 1920, and reviews the \\"history\\" till then, getting it all wrong, of course, but interestingly so. The second story posits the invention of a way to create sculpture instantly from life forms, much as photography had usurped realistic painting in that day, and reminds one of the 3-D printers just showing up now.<br />\\"The King in Yellow\\" is also certainly horror fiction. The first stories are framed by account of a morally appalling play of that name, which drives everyone mad who reads it. The play has widely been banned and criticized from pulpits and boards of review everywhere. The key to this book is that 1895 was the date of Oscar Wilde's trial for perversion, and \\"the King in Yellow\\" is surely a reference to Wilde's play \\"Salome,\\" which was also widely banned and criticized for its moral decadence. The principals in these stories all know each other and are all artists or writers, like Wilde and his friends. A gravely deformed man, apparently deformed by the exigiencies of law, is a mad character in the lead story named Wilde, and he has a cat that alternately attacks him and lounges on his lap purring: the reference is presumably to Wilde's unstable lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, who was responsible for most of Wilde's problems and his eventual imprisonment and death not long after release. (See the excellent modern biography of this remarkable character, \\"Bosie\\" by Douglas Murray.)<br />\\"The King in Yellow\\" therefore fits in with a then-literary fashion of revulsion toward the Wilde fin-de-siecle decadence, especially after Wilde's trial, when even his famous illustrator of \\"Salome,\\" Aubrey Beardsley, cut him dead in Paris when Beardsley happened to walk past a café where Wilde was sitting. (See the brilliant and definitive modern biography \\"The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde\\" by Neil McKenna.) \\"The Green Carnation\\" was another such work, published anonymously and variously attributed to men who had travelled with Bosie, at least, and had heard libelous stories of misbehavior with young boys.<br />\\"The Green Carnation\\" doesn't stand on its own: it's a roman à clef and you need to know the key. \\"The King in Yellow\\" does stand on its own, however, being a creepy series of horror stories with surprisingly modern notes of science fiction. After the framed stories, there is a charming if traditional story involving falcons, and then some psychological thrillers not related to the eponymous series.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|This is one of those movies where if you don't know the exact history of what happened, it makes it all the more enjoyable. However, this also causes you to hate the movie at the end because you feel the movie should change history and make everything ok.

Actually, I don't believe the author disclosed anything we haven't already heard about.  He just put it in the proper perspective and told us what and when the events actually occured. As he mentioned, the news media had many variations of what happened. He just put it in the proper order.

0345803507|1.0|I rarely write negative reviews because why expend the energy....but this 3rd book in a fun trashy trilogy is so bad I felt I needed to step up. The reason I felt so betrayed is that the thread of the first 2 books (mildly off norm sexual desires)got turned into a treacly morality take about a woman too stupid to handle birth control and a Baby That Solves Everything. The book also included a really inane kidnapping plot, a Barbie Dreamhouse and a world in which your admin assistant is supposed to keep you from getting knocked up.<br /><br />I hated this book with a white hot fever; I tell all my friends to read one and two and just let it go at that. This book was so horrible that it made my mind veer towards minor issues like \\"what's up with Gail?\\" and \\"who is Andrea, really?\\" and \\"where can I get a job where I get paid millions to yell at people on the phone all day?\\". I could not dislike this book more than I do. I have never loathed a book this much. Don't just wait until it is available at your library; even free,the price is too high.

B0041KBWM0|5.0|As a devout Jane Austin fan, I am thoroughly delighted with this movie version of \\"Emma\\". Ramola Garari is exquisite. Playful, sharp, and snappy yet capable of thoughtfulness, repentance and tender depth, the beautiful Garari brings this classic, beloved character to life. The cinematography is gorgeous, yet it does not replace or supersede the intelligent dialogue that makes a Jane Austen story so unique and enjoyable.<br /><br />Jonny Lee Miller is fabulous as well. Although maybe a bit young, his understated yet quietly intense demeanor makes for a handsome, tasteful Mr. Knightly. The music is truly lovely and accurately highlights the important emotional movements of the movie, providing a satisfactory cinematic substitute for Austen's descriptive prose. The scene at the Highbury ball is pure joy.<br /><br />Michael Gambon created an extraordinary portrayal of the quirky yet beloved Mr. Woodhouse. The two other movie versions of \\"Emma\\" portrayed such pathetic versions of this complex character. While Mr. Woodhouse is obviously a wounded soul, yet in the original novel he is well loved and truly respected. Gambon enacted this tension perfectly. Gambon's Mr. Woodhouse becomes a rich, sympathetic dear soul.<br /><br />The supporting cast is more than adequate, although the aforementioned actors steal the show. Frank Chruchill is well cast, unlike other versions. He is both complex, sympathetic and slightly provoking. I love the nuance and narrative given to Frank and Jane's romance. The attention given to their childhood tragedies enriches the plot wonderfully.<br /><br />So often one feels that a movie has skimmed over the most savory parts of a classic novel. Yet this version of Emma leaves no such residue; instead, Austen fans will be thoroughly satisfied and delighted.<br /><br />I have not enjoyed a movie so much since A&E's classic \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It is a truly beautiful classic that I had to own and will enjoy with my three daughters for years to come.

When you place the kindle correctly to allow sleep mode (camera on the right edge as in a book) the ports for HDMI out and micro usb are on the inside.

0316228532|3.0|Just to set the record straight on Casual Vacancy, I was given a copy as a gift. When you read the book, you need to forget this is the same author who gave us Mr.Potter's world of magic. This is set in a tiny English town and deals with politics,class struggle,poverty,drug use,child abuse,rape,self-mutilation, suicide, pedophilia,mental illness and other ugly realities. Much to her credit the author does this with sharp comic wit, however it does all go on a bit too long with the ending being somewhat predictable and heavy-handed. It goes from being a lively comedy of manners to over-wrought slog by the end. I will say that I did enjoy her attempt to combine cutting comedy with social commentary. This is definitely not a book for the children in your house with the salty, profane language and delicate subject matters.<br /><br />I'd say overall it's just OK as a literary work, nothing to get all worked up over. Like another reviewer mentioned, if you don't want to take the chance, pick it up at the library or ask for it as a gift. Hopefully this will help some of you decide for yourselves. Cheers!

The only UNFORTUNATE flaw in this beautiful Kindle edition is that  there are no page numbers, only Kindle's location numbering system...<br />The problem with this numbering system is that depending on the size of the font you choose for your screen, the number of the location will change accordingly, and if, for instance, you would like to communicate to another reader of this book the location of a passage you particularly liked, unless He/she has on his/her screen the same font size, it will be cumbersome for him/her to find it quickly in his/her book.<br />That is the reason why I gave it only 4 stars.<br />BUT, BY ALL MEANS, DO NOT LET THIS DETER YOU TO ACQUIRE (at this bargain price) THIS BEAUTIFULLY EDITED FRENCH CLASSIC!!!<br /><br />Armando Brons,<br />Caracas, Venezuela

159420411X|5.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00HNXY1U2 An Executive Summary of Nate Silver's 'The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't']]<br /><br />Making decisions based on an assessment of future outcomes is a natural and inescapable part of the human condition. Indeed, as Nate Silver points out, \\"prediction is indispensable to our lives. Every time we choose a route to work, decide whether to go on a second date, or set money aside for a rainy day, we are making a forecast about how the future will proceed--and how our plans will affect the odds for a favorable outcome\\" (loc. 285). And over and above these private decisions, prognosticating does, of course, bleed over into the public realm; as indeed whole industries from weather forecasting, to sports betting, to financial investing are built on the premise that predictions of future outcomes are not only possible, but can be made reliable. As Silver points out, though, there is a wide discrepancy across industries and also between individuals regarding just how accurate these predictions are. In his new book `The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't' Silver attempts to get to the bottom of all of this prediction-making to uncover what separates the accurate from the misguided.<br /><br />In doing so, the author first takes us on a journey through financial crashes, political elections, baseball games, weather reports, earthquakes, disease epidemics, sports bets, chess matches, poker tables, and the good ol' American economy, as we explore what goes into a well-made prediction and its opposite. The key teaching of this journey is that wise predictions come out of self-awareness, humility, and attention to detail: lack of self-awareness causes us to make predictions that tell us what we'd like to hear, rather than what is true (or most likely the case); lack of humility causes us to feel more certain than is warranted, leading us to rash decisions; and lack of attention to detail (in conjunction with self-serving bias and rashness) leads us to miss the key variables that make all the difference. Attention to detail is what we need to capture the signal in the noise (the key variable[s] in the sea of data and information that are integral in determining future outcomes), but without self-awareness and humility, we don't even stand a chance.<br /><br />While self-awareness requires us to make an honest assessment of our particular biases, humility requires us to take a probabilistic approach to our predictions. Specifically, Silver advises a Bayesian approach. Bayes' theorem has it that when it comes to making a prediction, the most prudent way to proceed is to first come up with an initial probability of a particular event occurring (rather than a black and white prediction of the form `I believe x will occur'). Next, we must continually adjust this initial probability as new information filters in.<br /><br />The level of certainty that we can place on our initial estimate of the probability of a particular event (and the degree to which we can accurately refine it moving forward) is limited by the complexity of the field in which we are making our prediction, and also the amount and quality of the information that we have access to. For instance, in a field like baseball, where wins and losses mostly comes down to two variables (the skill of the pitchers, and the skill of the hitters), and where there is an enormous wealth of precise data, prediction is relatively straightforward (but still not easy). On the other hand, in a dynamic field such as the American economy, where the outcomes are influenced by an enormous number of variables, and where the interactions between these variables can become incredibly complex (due to things like positive and negative feedback), probabilities become a whole lot more difficult to pin down precisely (though they often remain possible on a general and/or long-term scale).<br /><br />It is also important to recognize that while additional information can help us no matter what field we are trying to make our prediction in, we must be careful not to think that information can stand on its own. Indeed, additional information (when it is not met with insightful analysis) often does nothing more than draw our attention away from the key variables that truly make a difference. In other words, it creates more noise, which can make it more difficult to identify the signal. It is for this reason that predictive models that rely on statistics and statistics alone are often not very effective (though they do often help a seasoned expert who is able to apply insightful analysis to them).<br /><br />In the final stage of the book Silver explores how the lessons that he lays out can be applied to such issues as global warming, terrorism and bubbles in financial markets. Unfortunately, each of these fields is a lot noisier than many of us would like to think (thus making them very difficult to predict precisely). Nevertheless, the author argues, within each there are certain signals that can help us make better predictions regarding them, and which should help make the world a safer and more livable place.<br /><br />If you are hoping that this book will make you a fool-proof prognosticator, you are going to be disappointed. A key tenet of the book is that this is simply not possible (no matter what field you are in). That being said, Silver makes a very strong argument that by applying a few simple principles (and putting in a lot of hard work in identifying key variables) our predictive powers should take a great boost indeed. A full summary of the book is available here: [[ASIN:B00HNXY1U2 An Executive Summary of Nate Silver's 'The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't']]cale).<br /><br />It is also important to recognize that while additional information can help us no matter what field we are trying to make our prediction in, we must be careful not to think that information can stand on its own. Indeed, additional information (when it is not met with insightful analysis) often does nothing more than draw our attention away from the key variables that truly make a difference. In other words, it creates more noise, which can make it more difficult to identify the signal. It is for this reason that predictive models that rely on statistics and statistics alone are often not very effective (though they do often help a seasoned expert who is able to apply insightful analysis to them).<br /><br />In the final stage of the book Silver explores how the lessons that he lays out can be applied to such issues as global warming, terrorism and bubbles in financial markets. Unfortunately, each of these fields is a lot noisier than many of us would like to think (thus making them very difficult to predict precisely). Nevertheless, the author argues, within each there are certain signals that can help us make better predictions regarding them, and which should help make the world a safer and more livable place.<br /><br />If you are hoping that this book will make you a fool-proof prognosticator, you are going to be disappointed.

B00881VLCE|3.0|I enjoy puzzles so this game had me at that. Plus having a free version to play around with is always a must if you ask me.<br /><br />However when it refreshes ads at times the game is really laggy.  Also having a pop up every time I log in asking me to review is beyond obnoxious but has nothing to do with functionality of the game and is more a personal preference.
B0087HT36U|5.0|need more levels.  this was way better than any angry birds.  I want more levels some time soon.  awesome game
B008S80P38|2.0|Massive fan of his work - massive letdown for this album. It has ZERO flow. The tracks show minimal production work - nothing like his last 4 albums. As others have mentioned there are a number of tracks that simply don't belong on this album. Dude, you either make a dance album or you don't. The going 50/50 never works as is clearly seen here.... He has said publicly that this is his last album for this album label and I'm bummed if that is the reason for the lack of effort, but knowing him from all the livecasts I've seen (and conversed with him at times) it wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Just a mess of a record...
B009D0LBRO|5.0|console quality graphics it's fun to play and for the price of the game is well worth your money. this is a strongly recommended game by me of course don't miss out!!!
1475212607|5.0|Self-publishing is a business. One that requires an author to wear both 'creative' and 'business' hats. David Gaughran has written an extremely helpful guide here and I'd go as far to say as, don't attempt self-publishing without having read it.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Read the book and while I thought it was pretty juvenile, it was very entertaining and exciting...the same cannot be said for the film.  There was a lack of action, the sound editing was horrible, and they skimmed over some very important character development.  Watch it if you must but it's not worth ruining your reading experience.  Hope they get a new director and crew for the next two films - they did quite an injustice to the cast.
0805086846|4.0|I'm not a historian, but have read a few books on the plains Indians.  This is a great starter book to get an overview of the plains and west coast tribes, very well written, organized, and engaging, but not overly scholarly.  It is certainly one sided, does not go into detail on the violent lifestyle of the plains Indians (especially the further south you go), but demonstrates how the US consistently screwed the Native Americans and reneged treaties whenever we fond something of value (gold and other minerals, prime grazing land,...) on their assigned land.  We continued to box them into smaller territories, randomly assigned them to different climates and locales, destroyed their game, shortened their rations, then wondered why they revolted.  An excellent starting point to learn the key figures and events of different tribes, leaves you looking for more. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of maps.  Unless you are intimately familiar with the American west, you may need a computer handy to figure out where some of these places are.<br />Start with this, then go to books such Francis Parkman and the Plains Indians, Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West (initial contact with native Americans and European Americans), then move on to Empire of the Summer Moon (Quanah Parker and the Comanches), Blood and Thunder (Kit Carson and the Navahos), or any of the excellent books on the Lakotas (Sandoz - the Strange Man of the Oglalas, Marshall - the journey of Crazy Horse, too many others to list).  Again, I'm not a historian, many of these books have some negative reviews (except Sandoz and Parkman), but I found them to be very readable and engaging.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is amazing if you enjoy playing a game for free then this one will keep you occupied forever! definetly it don't even think about just get it.....go on get it right now do it!
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I just bought this cd about a week ago and it's absolutely fantastic.  I would venture to say that EVERY track is a hit.  Just came back from seeing him play quite of bit of his new music at a concert in Lafayette Square, New Orleans.  What a great show he and his band put on!  You've got to buy this cd - I can't get enough of it!  Rock on, Dr. John![[ASIN:B0074EIQUG Locked Down]]
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I felt like there should have been so much more written. I felt like the author rushed to finish this book. I was disappointed in the ending.  The other 2 books kept me so intrigued I couldn't put them down. Then book three was all over the place skipping over important parts and dewelling on things that I found rather boring.<br />DISAPPOINTED :(
B008DYZKQE|3.0|Elizabeth was clever to outsmart  the dragon and smarter to leave the prince!  wish there was a little more to the story. short but cute.

B008XG1X18|5.0|brilliant app every idea you've never thought of and every site you never knew existed! I never knew I could be so creatively inspired!
B008133MDK|5.0|This is by far the most cerebral show I have seen on TV (in my case Amazon). You have to watch each episode a few times over to see if you missed anything. Every episode has a reference to an original Sherlock Holmes story or stories (The Speckled Blonde, The Navel Treatment) that adds to the fun. The acting is superb - Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman breathe new life into the characters of Holmes and Watson. Viewers who have been fans of the Jeremy Brett series are sure to fall prey to charms of this remarkable show.
0763644765|4.0|Kind of bland but gets point across. Does not really keep interest during reading but it is colorful and is to the point.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a lot of fun!!  I don't know what it is about it but I couldn't stop playing it!! It's very addicting!!
B005I4JG80|5.0|I loved this book! Very fun and light to read. A great story of the authors dive into motherhood and a new culture!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Loved this book,not my usual style but awesome. Would recommend this book  to any one who likes to read. please enjoy
B0013F1D02|5.0|What an excellent film!  For a while I had doubts about this movie.  Although it had Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer on it, the cover looked suspiciously like a sappy fairy tale.  Finally, when I had run out of movies to watch on Amazon Prime (jokes), I reread the synopsis two more times, and started the film.  I couldn't have made a better choice.  This film was an actual adventure, with well-rounded characters that had complex stories and lives going on throughout the film.  I recommend 100%.  Enjoy.
B0083SBM7Q|1.0|I purchased the DVD/Blu-ray combo pack even though I don't have a Blu-ray player - I paid $5 more than the DVD so I could get the special features, which are usually pretty good with Marvel movies. When I got the discs today, though, I found that they have SPLIT the bonus features, so all of them but the director's commentary are on the Blu-ray disc, NOT the DVD. Not sure how you're supposed to access the bonus features if you only have a DVD player. Guess that was a waste of $5. Bad form & misleading advertising, Paramount.
B008NW67E0|3.0|Sounds like a weaker version of the last album.<br />Hoping for better based on all of the wonderful reviews.<br />Much prefer the The Head and the Heart.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I am not a fan of techno music in general, but I am a fan of talented musicians making something unique. This album is a perfect blend of classical violin and pop-techno (with just a hint of dubstep occasionally) that ends up being something completely different than the genres it was created with. Easily in my top 5 favorite albums of all time.<br />I could continue to ramble on about how great this album is, but instead I will suggest you check out Lindsey's videos on youtube. If you like any of those, you will love this whole album.
B000QZ1LXO|5.0|This product is worth the money. It does what it is intended for.  It has good amplification and the only issue I have is if you are mobile, it is hard to clip the microphone securely.
B00355L2TU|5.0|WOW, My wife and I have been using this system for 10 days(resting a couple) and the change is evident, fat is being reduce in all our body. The energy feeling after each session is great. The first 3-4 days were a bit like hell, the body ached big time and it was harder. Now the routines are easier, it starts to feel addictive =)<br /><br />I definetly recommend this!!!<br /><br />Thanks Jillian =)
B008XG1X18|4.0|Fairly solid app for kindle. Unfortunately it crashes and freezes about every third time I start it, but restarting remedies this and it is no more than a minor inconvenience.
B001QXCYZY|4.0|this is a very good microphone, solid, without any kind of external noise and a very good price, the only bad thing is this dont come with any kind of stand
B008TRUDAS|3.0|This book was okay.  I don't understand all the great reviews it got.  Good story line, I guess but it was slow and predictible.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Fun but wish I knew what all the symbols meant. And why do I have to spend real money to buy stuff in a fake land?
B00753MBHA|5.0|If someone from Accept is reading this: \\"Guys, thank you for producing one of the best metal albums in the last 10 years!\\"<br />I can't stop listening to it ... over and over again (even now actually).<br />This is a major work! Every song is a piece of metal art.<br />Just like the old times!!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|As a big Harry Potter fanatic I really looked forward to this book. I only tried the sample and what I read was not what I expected. I will not buy the full edition because this book does not interest me. Jo you have let me down. I hope that your next book will be another fantasy book then maybe I will be able to read it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a pretty neat battery app. It tells you exactly how much battery life you have left in terms of useage such as 1 hr 30 min of browsing time. It also gives you battery life in percentage and you can personalize it.
B008TMOIEK|5.0|This is an excellent compilation of classical music.  And yes you must like classical music or you will be very disappointed.  After reading the books you can imagine where in the books a certain piece would be playing.  I have played this over and over listening to it.  It wraps around you like the satin sheets in the red room.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|The case performs as I expected it would. Good quality construction. The plantronics headset fit neatly into it providing great protection. If your not going to wear your headset all the time this is a must have.
B008XFAT7S|4.0|the movie was great but that isnt what bothered me. what bothered me was i ordered it off amazon for 3.99 thinking i would watch it in HD on my ps3 but that is where i saw the HD rental for 4.99
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have become an avid fan of Lee Childs Jack Reacher.  I anticipate each new novel, and consume them rapidly.  Then like visiting with a good friend, I read them again at a later date.  Reacher, as a character, brings out some primal thoughts about how to deal with really bad people.  It may not be what we can or would actually do, but it strikes a chord and sometime, if you are certain, you just want to put a stop to something, and you can, you should.  A highly moral and amoral person at the same time.  Not unlike the character in the Millennium Trilogy.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I purchased this game for less than a dollar and it is worth $10! A must have. Reminds me of SNES games I played for years.
1936891026|4.0|WAR OF ART moved me--to keep moving. It's a great coaching device in perfectly digestible nuggets loaded with enjoyably pungent language, real world attitudes, and practical words of encouragement that make a difference. It made a huge difference to me.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I always seem to be a season behind in watching this show, so I only get to see it when the next season comes out on DVD.  The wait for Season 5 seemed interminable, but it was sooo worth it.  Still making me laugh out loud every episode!  I am so excited it came out in time for me to catch up and watch the Season 6 premiere tonight, too!  Love it!  Can't wait to see what happens next...
B007GCY8FS|3.0|A Reacher tale is always welcome, but this book seemed uninspired. Churned out, as it were. Reachers' trademark logic was voiced by other charachters in spots, and his usual runaway violence was almost nonexistent. Maybe the formula is just getting old.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|This is another cult classic as is \\"vacation\\".  Mars Attacks is still a laugh a minute and will be until the end of time.
B00846REIS|4.0|I don't get why so many people are so in love with \\"50 Shades of Grey\\", I mean I get it, hot sex, but the writing is not so hot.  In \\"Bared to You\\" I really got invested in Eva and Gideon from the start and was eager to see where the next book is going to take them.<br /><br />I will agree with other reviewers that at times I cringed at the stalker-like behavior of many of the characters, especially Gideon, and yet wondered why I liked him so much since I would never date someone like that in real life.  I'd be too worried I'd end up in a body bag one day. But since we're reading fiction and it's a fantasy character that isn't a bad guy, you get over it.<br /><br />I think that Sylvia Day writes very well, has a great command of language and generally does a good job of story-telling.  The sex IS hot as a firecracker, though as one other reviewer pointed out, there are SO many sex scenes that I found myself (and this is not the norm for me at all!) skipping through some of them because they do it so many times a day/night that all the sex scenes started to blend together.  I don't like romances that have no sex or hardly any, I mean that's what makes romances so great, but even I was saying, \\"Enough already!\\"<br /><br />Although someone on here complained about everyone in the book being so gorgeous, I really didn't mind that at all. In a perfect world we'd all be thin and gorgeous and let's be real, is anyone wanting to read sex scenes describing fat rolls jiggling whilst in the act?  I can look down at my own and see that, I don't need to read about it.<br /><br />All in all I think the book is definitely worth the read.  It has its flaws like all books do, some more than others, but a fun way to spend the day to be certain.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|I loved this book. I think it gives a great look at many of the issues our society is dealing with in a \\"hindsight is 20-20\\" kind of way. It addresses many of the environmental and physical issues plaguing this generation.
B002413TY2|5.0|Product arrived and appears to be as promised. I have not viewed it yet but all seems to be fine.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Uniwar - is an awesome turn based strategy game.  I love StarCraft and this gives me a little taste of it in mobile form.  I love playing this on my phone and tablet, it is easily one of my top 5 Android Games, and I play A LOT of Android games.  I probably have over 30 games on my Kindle Fire HD already.<br /><br />I love this game, and I was lucky to get it on the free app of the day, but would easily pay for this, now that I played it - Really well done, we need more games like this!
B008XG1X18|4.0|i use this app on my kindle fire - i love the app itself its my fav<br />i just wish it was a little faster sometimes nd also it does freeze up nd shut down ALL the time which is obv very annoying ..<br />other than the crashing luv it use it everyday hope this gets fixed!
B000I9YLUI|4.0|I like that this version of the story is well done, but still lets the nuances of the time the story was set in come through.  Great choices for actresses and actors!
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|This isn't a review of the movie, it's for the case. You'd think you fork out the extra dough for the 3D combo pack, the supplier would \\"hook up\\" their customer (that's me) with a case that holds all 4 discs. I am so sick and tired of these packaging marketing \\"execs\\" who make stupid money saving decisions that ruin their own product! I have 4 discs, I should have a case that holds 4 discs, instead of a case that holds 2 and you stack the discs on top of each other?<br /><br />This is the cheapest move I have ever seen short of buying the box set and getting all of my discs jammed in scratchy cardboard sleeves. C'mon people.
B009AMAK0E|4.0|I enjoyed this movie because it's about baseball people, the scouts and ex-players who have baseball in their blood, all of whom are in search of the next big thing. Clint Eastwood plays a legendary old time scout who can tell by the crack of a bat if a player has trouble hitting a curve ball. His daughter Mickey is a young women who loves baseball and is almost as good a judge of talent as her father. Her love interest played by Justin Timberlake is ex pitcher turned scout Johnny 'the flame' Flanagan.
0984999302|5.0|The Startup oriented book is one of the best I've read!  A MUST read for those that are considering a new business venture.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Hard to not buy in app purchases. I guess that's the way it is nowadays... But it's a pretty good game. I play it on my Droid Bionic. controls aren't bad. Thanks.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This was one of the best of the Reacher series.  The book kept your interest up to the end.  It started slowly but continued to keep your interest and you did not want to put the book down.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I always enjoy the Reacher character Lee Child writes about, and this book makes him even more intriguing. Great story, and keeps you reading the whole way thru!
B001EBWING|5.0|Insightful storyline about a man who makes selfless decisions due to what he sees as the greater good for those involved.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is addictive and fun. it is just like the carny games they have. wish u could get coins faster tho.
159448385X|5.0|This book was a great read.  I loved it as much as The Kite Runner.  Wish he would do more!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is exciting to play it it one of the most game during my free time so that means Im done writing see ya
B005IEGUDY|3.0|It's an ambitious concept.  When the book started I thought it was going to take me back to the Big Bang.  I stuck with it and it got better.  It got confusing at times because the story doesn't always have smooth transitions from one period or event to another.  It also skips through major events like some of the wars that shaped England.  It's a long book and I think it would have been better if it had been done in two books and it took more time to get from one thing to the other.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|In staying with the typical government statement, I have no comment on this book.  It is what it is and folks will argue until the day is done as to the content.  The only folks that know for sure if the book is classified, can't say it anyway.  To all that serve our country, Thank You!!  To all that have not served our country, Sit back and enjoy your freedom.  You could live in another country and have no freedom at all.  US Navy 85-05.
B008NR90HQ|5.0|If you read my review on Gary's last concert you will see the reasons why this far exceeds that release.  Gary looks, sings, and plays better in this DVD recorded three years previous, but released one year after the 2010 Blu Ray.  The best songs on here for me (not being super familiar with all of Hendrix's work) are \\"I Don't Live Today,\\" \\"Fire,\\" \\"Red House,\\" \\"Hey Joe,\\" and of course \\"Voodoo Child.\\"  Kind of depressing that Mitch Mitchell and Gary both died within years following this concert (and both loosely alcohol related deaths), but they really mesh in this concert.  Gary knew how to play Jimi's style, and I really don't think they could have picked anyone better for this concert.  There is also a CD of this concert, but for me the Blu Ray is the only way to EXPERIENCE this fantastic tribute concert.  This is a really a tribute to Gary as well as Jimi, but it any case it rates five stars!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Half to say that I'm very unhappy ! Why ? Your not writing fast enough ! Couldn't put this book down and when I was done I just wanted more !! Another excellent book mr child !
B003VANOFY|2.0|I bought this a few months ago, and I just now threw mine in the trash.  When it worked, it was like a dream, which is the only reason I don't give it one star, but problems were many, and ever increasing, until they culminated in an unusable product.  First, this did not work well out of the box, after installation of drivers from the enclosed CD, it worked somewhat, and had a nice control interface, where you could adjust aspects of your sound to your hearts content, and save profiles to switch between.  The headset still didn't work well with many modern programs under Windows 7.  Some research online yielded the recommendation that a new software package be downloaded and installed for this headset, which I managed to do after some work.  Afterwards, it worked a bit better, but there was no longer the nice interface where you could adjust different settings, or at least I couldn't easily find it, and had lost interest in spending too much time digging into how to fine tune this headset.<br /><br />As many reviewers have stated, this headset would frequently just put itself on standby when I didn't want it to, most commonly when there was a lull in sound, but sometimes, and increasingly, just whenever it seemed to randomly feel like it.  In the end, it had gotten to the point where it would just be a war between the headset and me pushing the button to get it out of standby a second later, at which point this headset went in the trash.  I now use a comparatively much cheaper headset, and am much happier for it.<br /><br />The range of this headset is a bit disappointing.  I couldn't do much more than leave my office, and it would cut out.  Using this headset for a conference call was out of the question, if you ever wanted to visit the kitchen during it.  Why is a house-wide range so hard for a $170 headset, when my far cheaper six-headset telephone and answering system works fine when I'm in the neighbor's yard?<br /><br />You can mute this headset in most casesby pushing a button, or flipping the microphone up, which is a nice enough feature, but it turns out that this is controlled by software that is not all that it could be.  For some programs, and notably GoToMeeting, the program is allowed to hijack the headset's mute control, so that you cannot mute through the headset controls at all, though it shows itself as on mute with the little red led.  I found myself making all sorts of noise, on mute I thought, while everyone on the meeting heard it, until they eventually complained.<br /><br />This product appears to be in alpha test status, and I'm very unhappy that Logitech has my $170, and I got an unfinished headache of a product for a few months, before I was forced to throw it away.

B007VYQ6DS|5.0|MY WIFE AND I SAW THE MOVIE IN A THEATER AND WHEN THE OFFER CAME UP TO BUY A DVD WE ORDERED A COPY FOR FUTURE VIEWING. IT WAS A GREAT FILM. I ALSO SAW IT A SECOND TIME ON THE BIG SCREEN WITH MY 8 YEAR OLD GRANDSON - FOR $1.00 - ON A MATINEE SHOWING AT A REGAL CINEMA.IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE THE SECOND TIME AROUND. MAYBE BECAUSE MY WIFE, MY GRANDSON AND I ARE ANIMAL LOVERS.....
B005LJKEXS|5.0|High quality wire with fast transfer rate. Used it for Xbox 360 wired controller extension and works great. Also more than sufficient length for any need.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This movie was not what I expected, having no prior knowledge of the comic, but I loved it.<br /><br />Hit Girl has got to be one of the best fictional characters ever. My wife found it a bit disturbing to have such foul language and violence coming from a young girl, but that was obviously the whole point. It's unexpected, hilarious and awesome, all at once.<br /><br />Hopefully the sequel is even half as entertaining.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love SOA!  It is one of the best shows I have ever watched.  I love all the characters and their back stories.  The show is emotional and makes me cry and laugh.  LOVE it!
B00008OE4W|5.0|If you like a movie with a unique group of HIGH QUALITY actors with a terrific story line, including suspense, comedy, excitement and intrigue then this movie is for you!  It keeps you in it the entire way through!
B004J00KJ8|2.0|Don't get me wrong.  The movie is brilliant and a timeless, classic comedy.  Unfortunately, Fox and MGM video didn't see it that way and dusted off an ancient HD master, putting no TLC whatsoever into this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />This film deserves nothing less than a full 6k restoration from the original camera negatives and audio elements.  What you get here instead is a wobbly, scratched, and dirty print with gobs of edge enhancement slapped on to try and beef up the inherent softness in the image.  Don't let the extremely high average MPEG-4 video bitrate listed on the package fool you... it's the old adage of garbage in, garbage out.<br /><br />It reminds me a lot of the typical cruddy treatment Universal heaps upon its catalog titles (unless it happens to be named \\"E.T.\\" or \\"Jaws\\"... and then Laser Pacific does the work).<br /><br />It's nothing short of shameful.

0374203032|4.0|I couldn't believe how easy a read this book was. Machael Sandel is a Professor of Philosophy at Harvard, a position you don't get to by being a mental lightweight, so I was not expecting a book that I could breeze through in two bedtime reading sessions. At first, I was disappointed - something in me was expecting something more akin to a modern-day \\"Critique of Pure Reason.\\" Clearly, Sandel was writing for the public, and he wanted his points understood without delving too deep into anything. Oh well.<br /><br />  However, the more I read, the more respect I gained for Sandel's approach. The book isn't just clear, it's brilliantly clear and well-structured. Every time I read a paragraph thinking, \\"yes, but you're not addressing this point,\\" lo and behold that very point would be addressed in the next paragraph or section. The other amazing thing is how fair Sandel is to opposing viewpoints; he's not trying to hide anything, and he wants to you to have the whole picture and draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />  Such an approach is admirable, if slightly limited by Sandel's incomplete understanding of economic thought. As other reviews have suggested, economists are not blind to the questions and issues he raises, and economics is not fairly represented as a utilitarian behemoth looking to crush all notions of wealth creation as anything but a universal good. However, relatively speaking, Sandal goes to lengths most political or social writers seldom go to give the counter-argument a fair shake.<br /><br />  However, the book's honesty is, in some ways, it's one major weakness. Because the argument is so humbly made, one is left with the impression that there really is not much of an argument to be made. Rather than being a desperate warning cry for an immediate end to our utilitarian ways, it reads more like a unperturbed pondering of what we might be losing through progress. It's like saying, \\"yeah, economic growth is admittedly good in lots of ways, but let's remember to check every now and again to make sure we're not losing something important, okay?\\" As an economic scholar myself, I came away from this book even more confident that I was, in fact, NOT missing anything, and that if this was the best argument Sandel and the like could come up with against what I believed, then I could be fairly certain I was on solid ground. Perhaps such an approach shows itself to be more effective with time? We shall see.<br /><br />  I recommend the book for it's exceptional readability, clear explanation and invitation to think about these issues on one's own, and for its almost superhuman humility and fairness. I think most will enjoy it, even if I'm left to wonder if Sandel might have in him a deeper argument that truly gives us something to think about.
B000KIPT30|5.0|This works like a charm. I record and edit with a Tascam US1641 audio interface. It's a simple interface, and only supports 1 stereo headphone out. As you may know, 1 headphone may be enough for recording yourself, but is not enough for recording other musicians/singers.<br /><br />This totally solves your problem. Sounds very clear, works great, has individual knobs for controling output. The preamp is very effective and sounds great, I HEAR NO NOISE, so don't worry.<br /><br />I recomend it, it's a no brainer for a home or amateur recording studio, and it works perfectly for professional studios too.<br /><br />Great price, great product and great brand.
B004J64QR4|1.0|I have seen this and LOVE it so I decided to buy it. BUT I have yet to even receive it and we bought it almost a month ago. I'm still waiting and would love to get it soon!
B00828JCI8|5.0|I purchased the last episode of season 5. I really enjoy the BIG BANG THEORY & have been watching the reruns. I missed this one and wanted to see it. I was not disappointed. The charactors on this show are great.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I wanted more for Katniss, She was too broken and unimportant in the end.  She did not become the heroine that I have invisaged.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It was a great game and worth the $1.99. It took up some space and some time to down load but, was also well worth it. I am hooked and waiting for #2. It worked great on my Kindle Fire.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|this book is excellently written and explains the history of world war one, whilst interweaving it with personal stories and love stories of the characters involved. Highly recommend it.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Quiet a captivated your time and keep your interest all along the show. Lovely scenery and great pictures. Subject is one for our contemplating time when along. Could have used more information on why the Whales could not be air lifted. I can understand a great deal of danger. Great. Don
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Movie works great and was a cheaper buy than in the store. Shipped in a few days and looked as if bought of the shelf.
B001UJUGZY|5.0|I originally was not going to watch this, but I did when I found out Sarah Michelle Gellar was in it. The movie is a really good thriller with twists I honestly saw coming. It's a great movie and definitely worth the buy! Although I do wish their was an alternate ending.
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|The CPU is fantastic. It's fast and reliable. All the good stuff about it in reviews is probably true.<br />The fan is great. It's quiet, keeps things cool, and works.<br /><br />The fan mounting system will cause you to despair of having a working computer in the next century. When a helper and I was building the computer, the computer didn't turn on normally. Upon turning on the computer, the fans all spun up and then died. At first, I fingered the power supply unit's main motherboard power cable but the computer didn't work after reinserting the cable. Then, a helper and I noticed that the CPU's fan had little black posts that didn't seem to be fully inserted. We pushed in so all the posts were through and made clicking sounds. Then, we re-locked the posts and tried turning on the computer.<br /><br />That didn't fix the problem.<br /><br />We resorted to pulling out the entire motherboard and putting it on my lap whereupon I realized that the fan was a touch wobbly and could still be pushed in more. I pushed in for a long time. I pushed many times.<br /><br />At last, one of the posts truly went in and I locked the post with a screwdriver to the accompaniment of a loud click. After that, the other 3 posts were easy.
B000ERU8ME|5.0|This LP sounds fantastic!!  The warmth,richness and detail that I experienced while listing to this LP is unrivalled by any digital format that is available. The crispness of the bass pedal attack on the drum head is distinct, the seperation of the voices on the vocal harmonies is amazing. The tonal quality of the acoustic guitars, the resonance of the wood bodies gives this LP a feel that is totally lacking on a Japanese Import CD version that I got a couple of years ago. The only way to hear this better would have to be in the studio when this record was recorded. Close my eyes and I felt as if I had the Eagles right in my living room giving me a private concert!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was spectacle after reading all the reviews.. I thought what the heck ill give it a try. Turns out its a great book/series, I couldnt put it down and im not a reader. So my advice is to give it a chance and make your own opinion about it.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Obviously, this movie was a big hit years ago and now it gets even better.  The video quality is amazing.  The sound is excellent.  Once again, you'll afraid to go in the water.

B0068LYEHA|5.0|Literally laughed out loud while feeling kinship for my fellow woman, recognizing the universality of being a woman in the world.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I am 1/3rd through the book. So far nothing has happened.  No sign of Jack Reacher. No sign of any action.<br /><br />If this is an attempt to do something new, fine. But so far its not a Jack Reacher novel.  Its some other kind of novel.<br /><br />Frankly the last two books bave been a VAST disappointment for me.  Why do people who find a successful entertainment niche feel obligated to move away from what works?  Reacher created the genra of the rootless powerful character who was unconstrained and thus able to go right wrongs anywhere at any time.  Now we have had back to back books that are frankly have no Reacher in them.<br /><br />Is it worth pursuing new readers and giving up your previously loyal fans.<br /><br />For my self, I will not be pre-ordering Lee's books anymore.  I will wait for one of two things, either Jack Reacher returns or he continues down this path and ceases to be worth my time.<br /><br />Personally I have over 75 books in the queue and choose to not waste my time on what is essentially bait and switch that Lee has executed in his last two \\"not Reacher\\" books.

B007THA4FI|3.0|Don't let anyone kid you: there's magic in J.K. Rowling new novel [[ASIN:B007THA4FI The Casual Vacancy]], but the magic is that she has clearly and adeptly transitioned away from the Harry Potter days, and done it in a very skillful way. And yes, I've read it from beginning to end, but more on that later, as this is a review about Ms. Rowling's new offering and not about me<br /><br />The red cover with its big X in the check-box is the first thing we see, and it's attention-getter, cleverly designed by Mario Pulice and illustrated by Joel Holland. Then in Part One we see the following:<br /><br />\\"6.11 A casual vacancy is deemed to have occurred:<br />(a) when a local councillor fails to make his declaration of acceptance of office within the proper time; or<br />(b) when his notice of resignation is received; or<br />(c) on the day of his death...<br />Charles Arnold-Baker<br />Local Council Administration, Seventh Edition\\"<br /><br />That small blurb sets the pace for what follows starting in the small, fictional English village of Pagford on a Sunday, with parish council member Barry Fairbrother's bad headache. By that evening, he's dead, the victim of an apparent aneurism in the parking lot of the local golf course. We soon find that his demise leaves behind a grieving widow, four children, eight members of the high school team that he coached, and a town that has some interesting characters.<br /><br />It turns out that Pagford is not such idyllic little English village that one finds in postcards. It's actually a nasty little place, full of simmering resentment, pretentiousness, extreme sexual frustration and poorly disguised bigotry. The death of Barry Fairbrother creates a vacuum within the parish council, the aforementioned \\"casual vacancy,\\" and that's when the scramble starts. There's Simon Price, a trash-mouth petty thief who sees the council position as an opportunity for bribery and blackmail. Another candidate is Colin Wall, the school principal. Then there's Miles Mollison, the son of a current council member. His parents want to see him elected to support their own local issues.<br /><br />And at issue is the Fields, a low-income neighborhood whose residents are blight on the landscape in the eyes of the 'better' Pagford citizens. When alive, Barry had been the primary opponent of the council's plan to reassign the Fields to the district council of the neighboring city, Yarvil, thus dumping the responsibilities for its poverty-ridden occupants, and driving them out of the area of Pagford's 'nice' primary school.<br /><br />The characters are woven into this landscape like the motley threads of a grimy tapestry. The late Barry Fairbrother had been mentoring a trash-mouthed teenage Fields girl named Krystal Weedon, who is fooling around with school principal Colin Wall's son. He's the best buddy of with Simon Price's son, who is in love with the daughter of the caseworker assigned to Krystal. You almost need a scorecard to keep track of the characters, along with the misdeeds of the parents.<br /><br />Then the election really heats up when slanderous (but accurate) allegations, posted by \\"the Ghost of Barry Fairbrother,\\" start showing up on the council's Website.<br /><br />☆☆ A Spoiler Alert of sorts... ☆☆<br /><br />For those hoping that Hogwarts will suddenly appear, it won't, and this is unquestionably not a book for children, and perhaps for some adults as well. Within the pages here, you'll find rape, drug addiction, suicide, thrashings and other similar topics. There is an ironic sex scene set in a cemetery, along with a number of references to condoms, both wrapped and used. The f*** word is used many times over, as a noun, an adjective an adverb and as an outright expletive. The language alone may be enough to turn some loyal J.K. Rowling fans away in shock and surprise. You've been warned; the choice is yours.<br /><br />Beyond all that, it's obvious that author Rowling has made the transitionfrom young adult to purely adult novels. It's largely well written, though it does fall flat in places, and can sometimes seem flat and dull. On more than one occasion I wondered if the author was peppering this tale with profanity and truly lurid actions to deflect us from a plot that seemed to be foundering. On the other hand, there are some memorable characters, though some of them are quite potty-mouthed, to put it mildly. And every once in awhile, we see J.K. Rowlings' sense of humor shine through.<br /><br />Showing my age here, but the theme of the author's debut adult book reminded me of the 1956 novel [[ASIN:B004P1JFIS Peyton Place]] by the late Grace Metalious. Her controversial story, with its scandals and sexual intrigue, stayed on The New York Times bestseller list for over a year, and eventually spawned a film and a television series that ran for a few years. I can see all those things happening with Ms. Rowling's new novel as well.<br /><br />I had ordered the Kindle edition this book when it was first announced. Was on my Kindle Fire very early today and reading the latest issue of [[ASIN:B005T6WW9M American Photo]] when the new book suddenly popped up and downloaded. I made a mistake and started reading, so pardon any typos in my review here as I've had about an hour of sleep. The Kindle edition is decently formatted with a readable sans-serif font, and I found it easy to read on the Kindle Fire as well as my Kindle 2.<br /><br />In this reader's eyes, [[ASIN:B007THA4FI The Casual Vacancy]] is a good, though not great. It's an over-hyped book with some memorable characters, yet it has a truly emotional payoff at the end. Subjectively calling it a 3-star read, maybe four stars at the outside: good but not great. But I'm actually looking forward to seeing what author J.K. Rowling will offer us next.<br /><br />If you can deal with the profanity and some of the topics noted above in my spoiler alert, then you may find it worth reading. If those subjects disturb you, then pass this title by and be glad that you have so many other titles available to read in the Kindle format or paper editions.<br /><br />9/27/2012from young adult to purely adult novels.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I usually do not rate or review the books I read, and reviews are not my thing. However, this is the only book that I have re-read. I loved the story so much, and was caught off guard by the ending enough to immediately go back to the beginning and start all over. I'm looking forward to the next edition of this series and to see where Vaelin's song takes him.

159514188X|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why was something that has been sitting on my shelf for months and I finally picked it up to skim it not knowing that hours later I would be so deeply invested in the book. This book was not a light read. You already know how it's going to end, there was no supernatural event that would bring Hannah back to life, she is dead. You know that from the minute you open up the pages and start reading. There is no climax, or anything it's strictly tapes that have her voice on it telling her reasons on what led her to finally give up on life and kill herself. I'm not going to lie I had a heavy heart reading this book the whole time.<br /><br />The book was thought provoking, a few times I found myself thinking did she really kill herself over something like that but then I had to remind myself everyone handles things differently and that we all have different breaking points in life.  And then to take all those small things and stack them on top of each other, well it can become a mountain of a hell hole for who ever is going through it and in this case that was Hannah.<br /><br />Clay - we listen to the tapes through his eyes and I liked how Asher developed and had his character grow within listening to those tapes. It  was just heartbreaking to know how much he cared and if he had stepped up a little bit more instead of wondering if all those rumors about her were true she might not have taken  her life.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why was dark, haunting, and truly captivating all at once. This is a book that I think should be read in classrooms and by everyone at least once. Even if you think this is not your cup of tea ( Me! I was one of those people ) I highly recommend giving this book a chance.
B001BP9ZFO|1.0|I haven't read \\"In Cold Blood\\", haven't seen \\"Infamous\\", in fact I never heard of Truman Capote nor the crime story that he wrote about. For a movie based on real life stories, it skipped through the facts too quickly (I almost missed quite a few key points, phrases) concentrating on the feelings instead. Even then I don't think the rendering of the characters' feelings was natural - some of the scenes were bizarre and illogical. The movie is too long and too artsy.

0316228532|5.0|Thanks a lot, folks. I looked at the reviews to see how other people had rated this book and why so I could decide whether or not to purchase it. What I found here were complaints about the e-book price and responses to those complaints. A book is a book, no matter the format. I own a Kindle but do not necessarily expect the books to be less expensive. My decision on what format to purchase is sometimes determined by the weight of the book but mostly by whether I have friends who would also like to read it. Get over yourselves and your complaints about price. Buy the book or don't buy the book. The rest of us don't really care and you are wasting our time.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A very moving book.I couldn't put it down. I hadn't read any of her books before but will be looking out for them now

B005FISBTO|4.0|For starters, I accidentally stuck this review under season 7, so if you saw it there, it's been deleted to correct my mistake.<br /><br />One thing that REALLY ticked me off, as it did a lot of viewers, was the 2 minutes of ShowTime BS that you have to watch first before you can watch Dexter, which to top it off had enough of Dexter season 6 in it to give away the ending.  Fortunately for me, as dumb luck would have it, I stick in a DVD and then to get to get snacks so that I don't have to sit through the commercials.  So if you buy it, please be aware of that.<br /><br />On to a short review.<br /><br />It's kind of hard to give a review for this season without giving away something, so this one will be short. I enjoyed it, but it felt like they changed directors or writers or something. Dexter's dad, whose been dead for some time, is at his side a great deal more this season. Also, what happens with Debra, his sister, seems out of character, but I can't say more without giving away something. The ending was really good though (BUT DO NOT SEE THE PREVIEWS PRIOR TO THE SHOW OR THE ENDING TO THE ENTIRE SEASON WILL BE GIVE AWAY), and you'll definitely go nuts waiting for season 7 to come out, like I am now.<br /><br />I know that's kind of a mediocre review, but I hope that it helps someone. It is definitely worth watching and the only reason that I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars has to do with things that I can't talk about without giving away parts of the season, but I will say that I just didn't enjoy it as much as other seasons, until the ending.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|great book. Do not understand all the controversy over this book. I read more classified information from the press releases from the White House. Funny that one of the operators comes out, and suddenly they cannot talk about what everyone else is.

0486278077|2.0|I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.<br /><br />  The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how `ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.<br /><br />  The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\"  [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.<br /><br />  Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.<br /><br />  The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing.ly at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.<br /><br />  The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair.

B005J7K950|5.0|Love this movie!!  The movie itself is (or was when first made) a ground-breaker in sci-fi...the addition of Moroder's soundtrack (including artists like Bonnie Tyler) is awesome!!  This won't be to everyone's taste, but should be on everyone's bucket list as something to watch because between Lang's pictures and Moroder's music, it's in a class of its own.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I have only heard about this from friends, and i decided to watch it all on the holidays! It is amazing new favourite tv show. Just have to wait for the next season to come out in Australia. I will defiantly recommend it to anyone that wants to get into a great show.<br /><br />Mother Ninja.
B006OHZVOS|3.0|I bought this as a gift for some friends who had recently had their first child, a son. The first copy arrived promptly from the seller, but some of the pages were blank where there should have been text &/or illustrations. The seller was great about correcting the problem. This is a well-loved classic, but this \\"new translation\\" is not as lyrical, in English, as the one with which I was raised. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, Harcourt.
B008N5UX9M|1.0|Steve Harris is a \\"beast\\" of the four-string, but this is incredibly mundane, and will put you to sleep if you're not careful. Also, the singer is bloody awful, and the production is worse!!!
B008O69SZ0|5.0|I can only add my two cents to all the positive reviews already in the can for this album - it's a must have!  And, this baby keeps getting better with every listen.  \\"Ta Shunka Witco\\", was, at first a little of a stretch for me - ok, Ian's fascinated with the Indian culture - but, after repeated listening sessions, this little gem actually works.  All the songs offer a great listen and the closer, \\"Life\\", brought a tear to my eyes.  This rocker is a must have - one of the best offerings of 2012.
B008RYN44U|5.0|Anyone who doesn't think this is a 5 star album really must try releasing their own album for me to hear.  It doesn't get much better than this.  Gwen and the boys may have been absent since 2001's 'Rock Steady,' but they pick right back up and deliver a fresh sound (which is hard for a band to do on a break that lengthy.) No Doubt shows that they are still delivering melodies true to their signature sound and offer infectious hooks that have me humming these tunes in my head all day.  It's absolutely brilliant.  I'm thankful the final product is so catchy, so original, yet at the same time, familiar.  I know this album already and that makes me happy.<br /><br />I just don't understand individuals who post reviews on an album they've heard once and proceed to complain. This album has grown on me like no other release this year.  I have loved Gwen's solo projects in the years past (yet people weren't happy then either) but 'Push and Shove' suits me like no project Gwen could do without the band.  It's No Doubt...2012. If you don't like it, feel free to pull out an old album. I, however, absolutely love it. This album is more than satisfying to me. The title track 'Push and Shove' is now one of my favorite songs ever released by the band.  They just have an unrivaled vibe together and it shows in each and every track.  The deluxe edition has acoustic versions and verifies the talent No Doubt still possesses.  I'm also diggin' the remixes. Get this album.
B007HJB42U|5.0|I had to wait for Game of Thrones, since I do not have cable TV, but my wait was well worth it!  This series was everything it needed to be.  Gritty, humorous, gutsy, and just simply amazing TV.  I love the characters, and the larger than life worlds that are created. The writers are not afraid to destroy their own characters, which gives the story a very dark reality.  This TV Series is fabulous, I can't wait for future series.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the third and final book of a a serie and the most amusing of the three. It doesn't ask profund questions nor sophisticated ideas. Just lot of suspense and adequate amounts of violence and sex. It can be read by itself, that is, you don't need to read the previous books to enjoy this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is addicting and exciting ..very mind blowing! !<br />once you play you cant put it down!! make sure your calender is cleared for the day! !
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|This movie was really good I would buy it again. It is not your typical fairytale but it is still enough of one that if you like them you will like this too. However it really isn't anything like Disney Snow White.
B0032KNA4I|1.0|i got the package but my uncle already bought me this, when returning it i have never got my refund, nor i got a message. plus there was no way to contact them. do not buy it at all nor waste your time looking at it. thank god i have money still but never will buy it no more unless i get my refund to erase all this and start some thing new.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fun just wish I did not have to spend money to play it! it is really entertaining and reminds me of the old computer game!
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Having read and enjoyed all of the Jack Reacher novels, this one came as a big disappointment.  The story line is minimal, the action vestigial, and both were complex and, to say the least, confusing.  The full length novel would have made a good short story.  Perhaps Mr Child has written one book to many.  I will not be holding my breath waiting for another.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this dark and twisty book. I felt that reviews of the controversial ending were exaggerated. It was not an expected ending and thats part of what I really liked about it. I walked away thinking how messed up it was. Truly a very good author, I thoroughly enjoyed the twists and couldn't put it down.
B004INNRFK|3.0|The CD is great but the packaging was not great.  The CD cover was cracked and not fixable.  I was very disappointed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. I could barely put it down. And despite th lack of sleep it caused thank you Mr. King, you did it again.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This is more about the author's emotional life than it is about hiking the PCT.  If you are looking for the type of hiking book that will help you maneuver the trail this is not it.  However, it is a good book.  Hiking isn't just about where you put your feet or sleep or filter your water.  Sometimes it is a walking meditation.  Just be ready for her angst.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Had such a wonderful time reading this book and getting involved in it. I'm sure that you will feel the same.
1619695006|5.0|I received this book as a gift and I loved it.  Great writing.  Highly recommend. It is extremely ignorant for people to rate a book as a negative just because you are unhappy with the price.  Dumbest thing ever! It you don't like the price, keep it moving.
B000TEMRIU|4.0|Classic Smashing Pumpkins sound.  So many hits on one album. Songs like 1979 defined an entire generation ands plays in the soundtrack of our lives.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|The Mist is one of my all  favorite Stephen King movies..I recorded it every time it came on cable but I finally decided to buy it so I could watch it when ever I wanted...the extras are great!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|challenging and addictive, once I started playing time just flew.  Wonderful brain exercise!  Would recommend it for young and old.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is a classic. Best hip hop album ever, maybe the best album ever. There really isn't anything to say that hasn't already been said. Every single song is perfect, the lyrics are perfect, the beats are perfect, nas' flow and voice are perfect. Buy it, bump it, love it!
B001992NUQ|5.0|\\"The things you own end up owning you.\\"<br /><br />Ironically, I originally picked this film up on DVD, then Blu-ray. If you haven't seen FIght Club yet.. do it. I'm a big movie buff and enjoy all different varieties of films, this is by far my all-time favorite. Aside from the film itself, this Blu-ray transfer is absolutely outstanding. The video quality is top notch, as well as the audio. Unfortunately, I missed this flick when it was released in theatres in 1999. However, I've been able to enjoy a quality experience with this HD version on my home theatre system. Without giving away too much, David Fincher does an excellent job with \\"easter eggs\\" on the disc. That being said, I picked this up the day it came out on Blu-ray for $25-$30.. well worth the asking price. Now I've seen it on sale for around $10-15. Highly recommended Blu-ray purchase.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I'd read the reviews and I'd seen the book on the Best Seller list, so I purchased it for my iPad and Kindle.  I titled my review \\"Disappointed\\" because I was.  I had hoped to find at least ONE character with redeeming qualities--one character whose fate I actually cared about, but I didn't.<br />My friends tease me because if I'm frustrated with a book, I'll stop reading and read the final two or three chapters before I decide if I actually want to go back and finish the entire book.  I did that with this book, and I was still disappointed.  The characters are without character, for the most part, and the ending is as bleak as the beginning.  A week or two later, I did finish the book; that is, I read the middle parts that I'd skipped previously--and I was still disappointed.<br />I won't buy another book by this author.
0062124293|5.0|Think you understand equity?<br />RUN to purchase this book. You will ROAR at Moran's examples, stunning wit and clear thinking. A particularly fun and smart read. I recommend it to every woman over 30.I think 30 because you need to have some life experience to appreciate her savvy commentary.For male readers:<br />Any guy intentional about a  respectful relationships with women must digest it thoroughly. You'll be grateful for the recon.<br /><br />A super book group read.<br />No regrets on this purchase - it will get passed around.<br /><br />Moreover, it's inspired my own next book: \\"How to be a KickAss Woman: A Manifesto for 50+.\\"
0439023491|4.0|I didn't love it like I did, 'The Hunger Games.' I had to buy it as soon as possible because I was so invested in Katniss' life that I had to make sure she was ok. THG gets you so invested in it that it was such a page turner. This book took a little more to get you into it because I think it gave you a sense of calm that Katniss was ok...in the beginning. I've never had a book series feel me with so much emotion. Reading this book made me want to end President Snow's life with my own hands. He is probably one of the best villains ever written, other than Joffrey, in 'Game of Thrones.' I hate them both with a vile passion, 'cause they're simply both such pure evil. I am a definite fan of Suzanne Collins and I look forward to what new series she comes up with.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest...where else can you look up anything and share it on facebook.  my friends love it and so do I.  you can look up dream houses...a recipe for dinner and your favorite clothing designer.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Movie very dark, slow moving, poor acting, and BAD director..... Became board and sorry for the purchase in the first 5 minutes. My rating: D.D.....for Double Dumb!!!
B006VR86MK|5.0|This is a riveting series.  Cast is superb. Quality of the picture was great and if you like period pieces about crime and corruption at its \\"best\\" then this is the one.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I loved this app. Best app ever but it quit working! Please fix this. I want my music back. There's no updates.
B008X8QCTO|1.0|Unreal...bait and switch. You get about an hour in and have not completed everything available yet you cant go on if you don't purchase another chapter!! That's right up there with taking money right out if my pocket. Nowhere does it state that when buying this you would only get half a game...REFUND!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|this could've been a great game. the controls are a little hard but had potential. YOU ONLY GET ONE RACE! YOU HAVE TO BUY THE REST! DONT GET THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO BUY FULL GAME

B001HBYHFA|5.0|Thank you for listening to the Browncoats and fans and giving us some closure to the much beloved Firefly Saga with this movie, Serenity.<br />This movie can be viewed as a 'stand alone' movie, but is so much more enjoyable as the end part of the series.<br />Highly recommended for those who like a good yarn, humour, space ships, cool characters and some eye-candy...<br />I bought this movie and the complete series, as a birthday present for the friend who turned me on to the series... one favour deserves another eh?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a very good game when your bored and there is nothing else to do games are a little difficult at first though
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So much more to the book than the movie offers! Love love love!!!! I cannot wait to read the other books!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I saw The Avengers in the movies, leery of its long running time. I walked out of the theater saying, \\"Wow. They really did need two and a half hours.\\"<br />It's rare when a movie is that long and you can't pick out a wasted minute, but this is one of those movies.<br /><br />Joss Whedon did an amazing job, not only of juggling the characters, and making sure everyone got their fair share of the action, but the stories within the story were great, so I didn't come away feeling ripped off by a CGI-Fest with no backbone.<br /><br />The relationship and conversations between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner were fantastic, and Mark Ruffalo did more than justice to the tortured scientist trying to hold in a destructive beast.<br /><br />The relationship developed between Captain America and Iron Man was fantastic too. I was glad they kept the tension, with the underlying, begrudging, respect, (a la Batman/Superman) in the formula.<br /><br />I'm glad they wrote the movie as a group of egos who don't get along at first. It made more sense.<br />The humor of the movie was outstanding, making the ride that much more fun, especially Ruffalo's few one-liners delivered with an understated deadpan voice, implying how much he has to keep himself under control.<br /><br />Tom Hiddleston was fantastic, reprising his character Loki from Thor as the villain.<br />And Samuel L. Jackson is . . .<br />C'mon, he's SAMUEL L. JACKSON!<br /><br />The action sequences were as good comic book movie action sequences should be: Over-the-top, highly charged, and fused with adrenaline.<br /><br />Is it a kid's flick? That depends on you. There's a lot of violence, but it's comic book violence.<br />If you're looking for a good Saturday night DVD to watch, this is it and then some.<br /><br />As for the 3D?<br />It came through great on this one. I bought Captain America 3D and Thor 3D, and maybe it's just me, but it wasn't there.<br /><br />All-in-all, after seeing all of them, including The Dark Knight Rises, I have to say Marvel's Avengers is the best superhero movie out there to-date.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The book titled 'A Wanted Man' by Lee Child was as most of his books was very detailed, however, this book was overboard in the details once Jack Reacher was inside the concrete structure.  I have read all of the Jack Reacher books and I would recommend this book as well as the others.[[ASIN:0385344333 A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel]]
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I first discovered Rosamund Lupton by reading her novel \\"Sister\\", (which I LOVED), so I was excited to read another one of her novels. \\"Afterwards\\" is a thrill of a read! It is similar in storytelling style to \\"Sisters\\",(read that one and you will know what I mean- how's that for a tease?), and Rosemund did not disapoint! This novel is chock-full of great characters, a good mystery, and she leads you through many twists and turns in the plotline. I am a fan and look forward to more from this incredible author!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game sucks big time I'm with the guy who gave it 1star it is pointless !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I hare it so much!!!
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Bob's voice is gravelly gravelly, but his songwriting is as strong as ever.  Every track on the album is a winner! I expect it won't be long before other artists start covering some of these songs.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|If you are a Matthew McConaughey fan, you'll love this movie. I just love watching HIM! GREAT story, GREAT music and GREAT performances. It's a surprise-a-minute movie.
B005KELW26|4.0|I like the Belkin Verve Tab Folio for my Kindle Fire.  It would be nice to design a place to store the power cord since the battery in the Kindle Fire does not last long enough when away from a power source.

0061537934|5.0|Don't we all wonder if our pet has an inner life like us?I want to think so and this book reaffirmed my hope that it may be true.<br />I was reluctant to read this book because I didn't want to cry over a sad story where the dog dies in the end. The surprise twist is that we get the ending in the first chapter.The last chapter is one of the most satisfying conclusions I have ever read.Dogs are mans best friend and this book delivers all the reasons why.
B0063GORYU|4.0|it is a fun game a lot of space and good hints. you can even change the Colorado. I really enjoyed playing.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This is not the Jack Reacher I have come to look forward to like a child on Christmas Eve.  I kept turning the pages hoping for some of the \\"bad ass ex military cop\\" but he does not really ever show up.  Perhaps he is aging and can't do that stuff anymore.  But hold on, this is fiction and he has the scars from his most recent book to prove that he can still mix it up.  He is less than a few days older than the Reacher of the previous novel... so what gives?  Lee Child: please bring back the real Jack Reacher....
B0087HT36U|5.0|its good needs more give me some more please I want it give it now come on do some more already
B003KRJNBW|2.0|I was disappointed by this movie because I was expecting something more along the lines of The Road.  Instead, what I got was I Am Legend meets Mad Max.<br /><br />The performances were stellar, of course.  Denzel Washington plays a convincing anti-hero, and Gary Oldman plays yet another unforgettable villain.  Seriously, I can still picture him in my mind.  Also, some of the scenes were beautifully photographed.<br /><br />But overall, the script put me off.  Post-apocalypse type movies and books attract me because they are typically thought-provoking.  What would the world be like if some huge disaster were to befall us?  How would people survive?<br /><br />In this genre, my suspension of disbelief is limited.  But your suspension has to be pretty high to watch this thing.  It's fine in a Bruce Lee movie when six guys get dispatched by a single swordsman, even if it looks choreographed and cheesy.  Here, however, it makes no sense.  It just makes the writer look lazy and unimaginative.<br /><br />This movie is entertaining, but nothing special.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this is a great game...fantastic graphics...hours of fun...great storyline...great minigames...can't wait for the next one...a definite must have for anyone who likes these types of games
B007N8RULO|4.0|a great way to pass the time. fun.self explanatory and easy to get the hang of. would recommend to anyone.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Built a budget rig today, this with an 7850, 8 gig of memory and 120G SSD pretty much handles everything I can throw at it.<br />If you are building a game rig and really on a budget I recommend getting this instead of an i5 and put the extra 100$ in a better video card, which makes all the differences in terms of gaming. This won't be a bottleneck for most of the games. However if you're doing a lot of cpu-intense tasks like video capturing/editing a better cpu does make the difference. But as I said before, for gaming, this little cpu is a solid performer and a better video card is way more important.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|The concept behind the plot could have been so good but ended up being so very, very boring. The characters are annoying and completely uninteresting. I really wanted to like this book but alas, no. I kept waiting for the plot to pick up, the story to get better but it never did. Where are the editors for the new books by established authors? They don't get a pass for having already sold books; their new books need to be good. Bah.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Couldn't put it down. This was not your typical spec ops book .This is a book I think anyone would enjoy. What a true hero!
B008JDAC7G|5.0|I was intrigued but skeptical that it would be fun. Was I wrong! Game play is fast,  controls are very accurate and the music makes you want to get up and BOOGIE!  The monsters are hilarious and the game is easy to learn. I hope they come out with more versions...it's a blast!!!
B0086449YA|4.0|These days I am in a minor key mode and for this one minor key dirge, Bluebird, I fell in love with this most beautiful album. Why only four stars? My musical appetite has not broadened to include related roots stuff based on Celtic and other influences. So not every song sends those warm shudders up the back, I am still a blues guy and for me the blues on this album are worth the price of admission. Others have summarized many of the blues on this album but no one has highlighted Bluebird and that is all i want to do here--just one song. I love the beat of this song--rhumbaish--slow tempo dirge like. Arranged beautifully full of atmosphere. If you know \\"Supernatural\\" by Peter Green (and covered by Gary Moore on Blues for Greeny) you will know exactly what this song's melody is all about. On this song there is an organ way back in the mix blended with the rhythm guitar just loud enough to create a mood; this is augmented by Kim Wilson's unamplified chromatic harp and Knopfler's thick bodied guitar tone (almost like a J.J. Cale feel). The guitar is not the strat tremolo sound for which Knopfler is justifiably known. Along with lyrics that can be taken literally or metaphorically as depicting the utter collapse of a life, throw in a perfect harp solo and a closing guitar solo that just flows along and you have me scurrying through my collection to program this song along with many other minor key gems like:<br /><br />Dave Specter--Minor Side Down; Rhumba and Tonic<br />Debbie Davies--All my forgiveness<br />Gary Moore--the Supernatural<br />Rick Estrin--Moving Slow<br />Eileen Jewell--I remember you<br />Robert Cray--Anytime<br />Dean Martin (Yes!)--Rio Bravo<br />Richard Hawley--Lady's bridge<br /><br />and the list goes can go on. Yup, just one song and there is a flood. This is very fine album, and like fine wine to be savored and enjoyed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was an excellent account of the mission to take out bin Laden. I found that I could not it put down and had to keep reminding myself that it was not fiction. Having worked in Afghanistan for some time as a contractor, I found many of the details and imagery very accurate.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested finding out the real story of how the number one terrorist was taken out.
B006L4MX0Y|5.0|This is a very cool, often strange movie. It's plainly obvious that The Hunger Games was really just a knock off of this movie.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|i verymuch recomend this app its alot better tgen some others ive found and to nyc idk whats wrong with it but it works perfectly fine on my kindle
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very fun.It is also addicting because when I start I cant stop.The only thing I don't like about it is that you don't get enough coins .I. use up all my coins in about 5 minutes.
0525953728|4.0|A good insight of a Seal's relationship with his fellow warriors. Great detailing relating to the take-down of OBL, but don't look for any National Secrets the Obummer Administration says were violated. \\"Blow the house...really!\\" (Best line in the book.)
0984999302|1.0|6/2014 update<br /><br />Confirmed with customer service at Steve Blanks outfit that the current Kindle is indeed an exact match to the paper. Good stuff and highly recommended, as is his course.<br /><br />I'm a huge Steve Blank fan. Hit the kindle version over paper in the interest of speed.<br /><br />Right away I'm told that if I have a physical product I need to get a different ebook version, another type of product, get yet another ebook version. Of course they don't tell you how to do that, or if there is a charge.<br /><br />Really poor form.<br /><br />If i buy a kindle version of a paper book, I expect the book; not some undocumented bait and switch.<br /><br />I expect I'll get the paper version, but what a bad taste in my mouth.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have gotten all kinds of great ideas off this site. Don't know how I ever made it without it.
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|I was excited to get the soundtrack. I was disappointed that the 'No Diggity' part in the soundtrack is NOT the version from the movie - which I think is much better. It almost sticks out like a sore thumb during the entire riff-off track. Major bummer!

0440242401|5.0|Lexi Smart feels pretty dumb these days. She has woken up in the hospital with no recollection of the last three years of her life. Talk about a kick in the teeth! I'm sure this is nothing I'd want to go through personally, but it sure was fun to read about Lexi's roller-coaster ride as she tries to reclaim her memories and herself.<br /><br />Lexi still thinks she's the somewhat chubby, 25-year old, flooring sales girl, with bad teeth and a crumby boyfriend. But, she's not. She is now a successful, 28-year old, department manager, with a gorgeous loft apartment, and a handsome, uber rich husband, who adores everything about her - well, everything about the woman she can't remember she is, anyway.  Her \\"new\\" life seems perfect, with a closet filled with designer clothes, expensive makeup, purses, and shoes, a housekeeper, and a Mercedes convertible to boot. But, is this life of hers really so perfect? Or could it be too good to be true?<br /><br />In \\"Remember Me?\\", Sophie Kinsella submerges you into the life of Lexi Smart, and her struggle to remember who she has become.  Sophie does a wonderful job of bringing all the characters in her novel to life. She makes them all so easy to imagine and connect with. I couldn't help but find myself rooting for Lexi to remember her life, and my heart dropped many times when she didn't. The book brought out many emotions for me, from sadness, to excitement, to anger, to downright pity. There were times while reading I found myself laughing out loud - like when Lexi couldn't remember how to walk in high heels. Other times, I just wanted to hug the main character, or throw something at her scheming co-worker for being and jerk and trying to make her look incompetent in front of the boss, or scream at her husband for treating her like a 4 year old, or smack her mother for being insensitive to her situation.  Lexi is a character that I believe many could easily relate to. She's your best friend from childhood whom you will always love, no matter what.<br /><br />This is the fourth book from Sophie Kinsella that I have had the pleasure of reading, and I will definitely be looking for more of her work. The Shopaholic series was wonderfully written and \\"Remember Me?\\" is just as good, if not better.  Though, I have to add, as an American, some of the terminology was a bit strange. The British use different words and slang than we do in the states, so sometimes that was hard to get past. I am glad that I have a friend from England, who had informed me a while back that having a vehicle \\"valeted\\" in England was the same as having it \\"detailed\\" here in the states, not having someone park it for you. This is one thing in the book that I would have been confused about had I not been told the difference. That being said, this book does not disappoint in the least. I found myself unable to put this book down, and honestly didn't want it to end. That, to me, is a sign of a great novel. I would read this one again in a heartbeat. Way to go Sophie Kinsella on another exciting read! I look forward to reading more novels from this author.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Where is Doppey?  Doc?  Seriously!!!<br /><br />Yet when you sit back without anything in your mind to pre-judge this title....<br />It was very good.<br />The effects are terrific and the acting was steller.<br /><br />Thor's actor shines through as the huntsman but with that thick accent you can't help but recall Thor through out the film.<br /><br />This is a purchase for me!  Charlize Theron did a marvelous job as well!<br />Some don't care for this due to the TWISTS and changing they did to make this classic tale their own...<br />Check it out for yourself.
B000JML90Y|5.0|Historical Classic.  Written by a Biologist who started his academic career in Theology.  Its a nice read and you can easily see how he was influenced by the discoveries of the 1800's.
1401322786|5.0|Have you ever had a moment where you wished time would stop around you allowing you to simply enjoy the moment?<br /><br />Maybe a time you regret and wish to relive.<br />Just think about our lives and how instrumental the concept of time is to everything we do.<br /><br />Who invented time and why?  What caused time to infect our lives in the way it has. We cant go a long amount of time without checking on what time it is. Or we measure our days by the amount of time we work or how much we produce in that time.<br /><br />In the Time Keeper we meet Dot who first began to measure time. We see his journey from time creator to becoming Father Time, locked in a cave for multiple lifetimes. We see him begin to realize how precious time is.<br /><br />Here is what the publisher had to say:<br />From the author who's inspired millions worldwide with books like Tuesdays with Morrie and The Five People You Meet in Heaven comes his most imaginative novel yet, The Time Keeper - a compelling fable about the first man on Earth to count the hours.<br />The man who became Father Time.<br />In Mitch Albom's newest work of fiction, the inventor of the world's first clock is punished for trying to measure God's greatest gift. He is banished to a cave for centuries and forced to listen to the voices of all who come after him seeking more days, more years. Eventually, with his soul nearly broken, Father Time is granted his freedom, along with a magical hourglass and a mission: a chance to redeem himself by teaching two earthly people the true meaning of time.<br />He returns to our world - now dominated by the hour-counting he so innocently began - and commences a journey with two unlikely partners: one a teenage girl who is about to give up on life, the other a wealthy old businessman who wants to live forever. To save himself,he must save them both. And stop the world to do so.<br />Told in Albom's signature spare, evocative prose, this remarkably original tale will inspire readers everywhere to reconsider their own notions of time, how they spined it and how precious it truly is.<br />______________________________________________________________________<br /><br />So final critic. I read this novel in two days and just a few hours each. It is well.written. well developed plot. Very captivating and will not disappoint.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder is the first book in The Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer. Meyer took a very well known tale and modernized it, adding in a few fantastic twists to make it her very own. To say it's unique would be a vast understatement in my opinion. Cinder is a superb reading experience from beginning to end.<br /><br />The story is told in the third person perspective and follows both Cinder, our main character and Kai, the prince of New Beijing. I love when we get to delve into the heads of different characters in a book and this was no exception.  Cinder and Kai are both dynamic and interesting characters to behold and they kept me more than entertained as the story went on.<br /><br />Cinder is a truly unique character in the young adult genre. How many cyborgs do you read about? She was my first and I could not help but admire her as I followed her story. People  in Cinder's world seem to think that because she's a cyborg she doesn't have feelings but that couldn't be further from the truth. Cinder is deeply loyal, brave, sweet, smart, and spunky; she is more human in her feelings than most of the 'normal' people in her life. Then we have Kai. Yep, he's a prince and he is most definitely charming but there is so much more to him than that.  He is genuine and selfless and so many other lovely qualities that I could just keep going on and on. What I like most about his character, though, is that he acts like a regular person. He doesn't expect special treatment, he doesn't look down his nose at people. He is extremely lovable.<br /><br />This book was amazing from start to finish; fast paced, thrilling and addictive. I was completely sucked in from the beginning. I read it in a day; barely putting my kindle down and ignoring my husband's attempts to interact with me. There were a few twists thrown in that made me gasp aloud and when the end came I was left wanting more. I cannot wait to read the next installment, Scarlet which is due out on February 5, 2013. ~Mel
B008N5UX9M|3.0|Ok, first of all, all of us were adviced this wasn´t going to be like Maiden, that´s all right, there are other great rock and metal styles out there. What nobody told us is this record would have a mixture of good and extremely bad material.<br />Let´s take it by parts; tracks 1 and 3 are really crappy alternative like songs, and i mean really crappy, not even close to a good alternative song (yes, they exist, not many but some); songs 2 and 4 are just fair, but at that point (4 songs) you´re already worried your bucks were a waste. Things get better from fifth to eighth track, they´re good songs, \\"The chosen few\\" and \\"A world without heaven\\" even could be great if they had a singer in them, wait, what? they´re no instrumentals, but is that singing? This guy doesn´t exactly sound bad, he just doesn´t sound; he could be a good pop singer, but it bores to death in the rock world.<br />The end gets sloppy again with the last too songs, they don´t belong to rock hell, but they certainly deserve purgatory.<br />Bottom line: 4 \\"could be great\\" songs, 4 boring fillers, 2 pieces of crap. Mr. Harris: Any of your projects deserve a real singer, and you´ve got 2 fails in your records (remember Boring Bailey?)<br />Am i being too generous with 3 stars?

0316228532|5.0|I purchased \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" last night on my Kindle Fire.  As a student, I don't have a lot of spare money for books and the price was slightly deterring, but I grew up with Harry Potter and absolutely love JK Rowling's writing, so I decided to go ahead and buy it. I have experienced no problems at all with the format of the book; the Kindle Fire offers 8 different font sizes, and I have been reading this book at the second smallest option.  So, price and Kindle format both were essentially non-issues for me.<br /><br />The most important thing to remember when beginning to read this book is that it IS NOT HARRY POTTER.  This is not a world of wizards, witches, and magic.  This is a very real, very gritty story told in third person, alternating between the viewpoints of a multitude of characters.  It follows the various members of a community after the death of a prominent society member - one who used his council seat to aid the poor (which caused many wealthy community members to dislike him).  Rowling has created a masterpiece of interweaving storylines, connecting characters throughout the novel and always keeping the reader interested.  Yes, this book contains profanity.  Yes, it tackles uncomfortable topics such as drug abuse, rape, and familial abuse.  But it is well-written, and it is worth reading.<br /><br />I gave this book five stars in part to counter-act the many one star reviews coming from people who have not even read it.  4.5 would be more accurate.  I highly recommend that you at least sample it - for those of you who love Ms Rowling's writing style, you will most likely fall in love with this book almost instantly.  Just remember that if you are looking for the (mostly) lighthearted magic of the Harry Potter series, this is not the right book to look at.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love this game! It makes me happy and tingly! I play iy every minute I get the chance! Love it love it!
B002BU0DPE|4.0|The sound is great, you can adjust the bass + chat volume. Why spend $200 for Dolby 7.1?? The cord is sooo long(16ft!!!, had to wrap part of it up), which is good for me since I use a 9.5 foot HDMI for my Ps3 to TV(Ps3 being farthest from me). Also the RCA Splitter cable(wire for the TV) enabled me to plug in another cord without having to buy an extension cord. Stereo Expander Switch, especially great for playing games like Battlefield 3 where you can hear slow footsteps, running, etc.<br /><br />Next time I'll graduate to the wireless, but since I paid $65 no tax no shipping fees, I'm satisfied. I was forced to buy a Headset because I had pre-ordered the new Hauppauge! HD-PVR 2 for $161.14 no tax no shipping fees, which is great as well.<br /><br />REMEMBER to REGISTER all products you buy, online leaves a better paper trail than by mail.<br /><br />Another note: I know that Amazon.com is taking Best Buy, ABC Warehouse, etc. to the cleaners & effecting statewide jobs with their lower prices, no tax, free shipping & fast quality service, but people like me have to budget every dollar & be smart about every luxury item. Sad but true.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|How much fun!! When you have a couple minutes to kill you can zoom around and try not to get zapped.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fascinating. The book allows the reader an in-depth view for the day to day living of these honorable soldiers. The detail of the everyday journey and missions is incredible. You realize from the beginning that these are teams and no one person is more important than another and yet the team works as one. It's a great read and I thoroughly enjoyed the journey.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|If you like Mark Wahlberg then watch this movie. Great action flick. I was reluctant because I hand't really heard anything about this movie but trust me, you will enjoy it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|When it comes to a pdf reader this is way more! With the ability to highlight, underline and make notes in the margins it goes above and beyond what I was looking for and I am glad.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome and everyone should buy this game. many people say this is too much money for the game but it is worth it one of the best games on Pc and on kindle fire
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and on my Kindle as well and it is amazing. It helps me keep in tune with God's word throughout the day, no matter where I am. Everyone should have it.

B008NW67E0|5.0|Babel is simply an enjoyable and outstanding album.  These guys are truly talented song writers.  Each song is captivating and amazing.  Good job guys.
B0086700CM|3.0|the thing is its the same thing everytime. its good to play now and then but its not a type of game that you can play for hours without getting bored.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|First off I want to applaud Green Day for releasing 3 albums of new music in four months.  In this day and age of artist releasing an album once every 3-4 years because of lack of sales, Green Day goes ahead and gives you 3 full albums of new material.<br /><br />As far as UNO goes, I really enjoy the hell out of it.  The funny thing is that the two weakest tracks on the album are the two singles they released.  Kill The DJ and Oh Love are fine songs but compared to the rest of the album they are my least favorites.  Carpe Diem, Let Yourself Go, Nuclear Family, Angel Blue, and really most of the album are fun 3-4 minute rockers that will remind you a bit of old Green Day.  If you still expect Green Day to be the band they were before American Idiot then this album isn't going to be something you want.  That Green Day is gone.  This Green Day is guys in their forties, families, and millions of dollars.  Not exactly alot for them to rebel against.<br /><br />I loved American Idiot and enjoyed 21st Century Breakdown but its good to have an album full of just simple straight ahead rock songs.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|simple yet addictive. great for my son to pass time or just have some mindless fun. good download just to have.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Obviously, everyone will have their own opinion, but I think hands down, this is the best comic book movie ever made. And possibly one of the best all around action adventures ever made. The 3D on this blu ray looks surprisingly good. I've only viewed one other movie on a 3D TV, so my experience is limited, but I thought this looked great. Maybe even a little better than in the theater since I can choose where to sit. I'm only starting to delve into the special features, but so far they've been very entertaining. At this point, I think I'm going to upgrade to the massive set they're releasing next year just to see what other goodies they'll have added. This is such a ridiculously good buy at $19.99, don't miss out!
B008133DO8|5.0|I love this show. Can't get enough. The acting, cinematography, music and plot lines are great. Wish there were more of these made. Look forward to seeing more!
0525953728|3.0|I am retired military and I do enjoy a good book; especially about the military. While the book is a good read; and very informative I found it difficult to keep up. One minute we are in present day; the next we are in the past then a third flip to some time in between the two. I know many loved the book; and I thought it was good; just difficult for me to follow.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|The writing is bad and it seems to repeat itself over and over.  Does not seem to move any further from chapter to chapter!
0824835921|2.0|I was very disappointed by this book, so praised by many. I found most of the mnemonics bizarre, and anyway, past the first few, I found it harder to remember the mnemonic than simply the kanji. It is all very fine to have the meaning of a word, but what good is that if you don't have as well the pronunciation in Japanese? And the majority of kanji have not just one, but two: the \\"kun\\" and the \\"on\\". I also question the order in which the kanji are shown, with rarely used ones right by some of the more common.<br /><br />After a while I just gave up on it and switched to Henshall's book, which, at least for me, worked infinitely better.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|The XX continue to make the case that less is more.  Coexist sounds like a more trying and passionate album than its predecessor, XX.  The songs tend to be slower and vocals more raw but the powerful lyrics and format remain the same.  I really enjoy this album and the beats on a number of songs.  This album receives 4 stars from me because it doesn't pack a punch like the first one and seems to be missing something...even though that is what the XX want you to say.
0316228532|5.0|J.K. Rowling is best known for her Harry Potter Series. This book is an attempted shift at an adult novella. The book itself comes in an orange and red hardcover binding. The cover is a bit visually disappointing - a simple black \\"x\\" in a checkbox with vintage lettering indicating the title.<br /><br />The story is set in Pagford, an odd ramshackle sort of town with low income housing on its outskirts that exists to generate crime and promote substance abuse. The unexpected death of Barry Fairbrother, the town official who tirelessly strived on behalf of the downtrodden, at a golf club attended by the rich creates a civil warfare and strife over the continued welfare of those same downtrodden individuals that causes much debate. His death leaves a hole in the council and the rich see the opportunity to put one of their own in his place. Mr. Fairbrother sought to prevent transfer of \\"ownership\\" of the low income housing to the next district, and his replacement would allow it to happen. Certain statements begin showing up on the council website that throw things for a loop.<br /><br />As a whole, the book itself can pose difficult reading for those who are used to Rowling's usual light-hearted Harry Potter (although dark and gloomy at times) fare. The book creates a number of issues that are currently ongoing and applicable in today's day and age. The book has topics a Potter fan would never expect to see - cursing, polysubstance abuse, sex (\\"that miraculous vagina\\" is among her especially noteworthy terms and has received much social media buzz), racism, snobbery, the list goes on. The book focuses on the rich and corrupt - an interesting note given that Rowling came from humble beginnings and is now one of the richest women in England. There are also some horrifying elements to the book that are not for young readers, such as a detailed rape scene that I would not expose my children to.<br /><br />I found that there were not too many characters with whom I could identify - perhaps this was Rowling's intent. In her previous books, the readers jumped onto the different characters and found elements that they appreciated. Here, the darker fare makes the characters seem more distant. Overall, the book was a good and entertaining read. If you dont mind a simple and expected plot, and a clear social message about shared responsibility, then pick the novel up.<br /><br />The kindle version of this book has had some criticisms as to quality and price. This review is solely for the print edition. Thanks for reading - let me know if this was helpful or if you have any questions I am happy to answer in the comments!!!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It is easy to use and it will automatically pop up when you start charging. It can be fun because you can change the colar of the battery.

B008Z9YGEE|5.0|While no movie can ever be as good as the book or cover everything in it, I feel this movie did the book justice. It covered the main story line quite well and didn't miss a beat in how it portrayed the story. Great movie! A must see!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|It starts fast and never lets up.  Jack Reacher is, as usual, the toughest SOB in town.  I will never miss buying the next book from Child and can hardly wait for the next one.<br /><br />John Gingeridh
B002VECM6S|4.0|If you have a soul in you then this movie should be able to stir it. Starring a 17-year old black kid that's in and out of foster homes who's never really given a chance, a very considerate white woman comes into his life and changes it completely. She (Sandra Bullock) gives him a new chance at life with her family and he starts to turn things around...<br /><br />It's about 25% football and 75% emotion.<br /><br />A good watch that sorta drags towards the end.<br /><br />Nice for the older bulk of the family to enjoy. Has some language and brief drug use towards the end of the movie.<br /><br />4.25 stars.
1451629192|5.0|This book is a good book, but I can see Jaycee went thur HELL. I can't imaging going thur what she went thur. I haven't finished reading the book yet. I am only half way thur the book.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|It's hard to describe these guys.  They have an indie feel, but their sound is so unique and fresh and they definitely stand out from other new bands.  The entire album is 100% listenable from start to finish.  The songs transition smoothly and before you know it, the album is over and you'll want to listen again. It's great because their music is diverse enough to listen to before bed or crank up and enjoy the beats.  Well worth the purchase and looking forward to their future albums.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Based on the premise that I made a commitment to myself to finish all books I start and finish this trilogy - I was elated to complete this book.  It was not until this last part of this trilogy did a storyline actually evolve with at least a glimmer of richer characters than just mere sex partners.  I had some revival of hope when I saw an interview with the author on television - she is quite funny with the best British humor.  But as I continued through this last installment I remained disappointed in this series vowing never to allow any additional installments to invade my Kindle.  Approaching this entire series I came into reading this trilogy with little knowledge of the subject matter.  The author's writing and use of words continue repetitive.  It is a proven fact that if something is repeated 7 times you will learn and even remember it.  Well, with the repetitiveness of this authors writing, I learned or refreshed my memory of new words.  I also learned that it is rather fun to speak in third person referencing my inner god.  When I read my goal is to broaden my knowledge and enjoy what I am reading.  I suppose it is easy to say that I accomplished my goal of broaden my knowledge in sporadic aspects but I cannot not admit to completely enjoying what I am reading versus more like I received a flat emotional response from what I was reading.<br />As I have said with the other two installments in this trilogy:<br />\\"There are parts of this book that I did find attractive and stayed with me, but overall, if I were to think about purchasing this book, I would pay attention to my inner god as she was holding up a neon sign above her head that said: 'Move along, there is nothing to see here'.\\"
B0026SCMNM|3.0|The book kept my attention but the ending was weak or presumes a follow up book. The characters were not well drawn enough to inspire an emotional investment but they were sort of interesting.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Departures is a beautiful movie with amazing photography. This is a story that transcends the time & place where it takes place.<br />It shows the value of respecting and treating the departed with dignity.  Then one can appreciate and live a full life.<br />Some humorous scenes as well as touching, emotional ones.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I installed the app mainly to calibrate the battery reading. It also has given me some insight into what uses the battery the most and the charge/recharge cycle times. All in all a useful app.
B0099G3I96|4.0|I think the album is excellent! All No Doubt albums are quite different from each other and this is no exception. It is kind of mellow compared to their previous work. Tragic Kingdom will forever be my favorite album; however, the band has grown and evolved over the years and the style of their music reflects this. Rock Steady had some great songs, but there were some tracks that I always skipped. I listen to this entire album and each song is enjoyable for me. It does lean more toward pop. I feel their music has gravitated in that direction over the years, but with their own No Doubt style. IMO, it does not feel like Gwen's solo works as previous reviewers mentioned. You can feel the entire band in this album and I am so glad No Doubt is back!<br /><br />Update: The more I listen to the album the more I like it.  Push and Shove, Undone, One More Summer, Easy, and Settle Down definitely are the standout tracks (for me).  But like I said I pretty much enjoy all the songs on this album.  No Doubt has never really done a song like Undone (most notably the guitar) and I think that song is superb.
B005DN7W4G|5.0|When I first seen this movie, i liked it. It was pretty much what could happen if an asteroid were on it's way here. Not like in Armegeddon movie. More realistic. I even chocked up on some of the story. Sad but great.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I hate it. I don't like the upgrade its awfull.  I did like it when it didn't have a upgrade IT BAD I HATE IT.I<br />hope you don't get this app
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is an good app for your kindle. it tell you how long it stays on before you battery goes dead and everything. love it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is better than the first book.  I still don't see how they are going to make a movie of this trilogy!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Book is an eye-opener about the horrible effects of wheat and gluten on the body. I will start changing my eating habits to eliminate wheat and gluten from my diet from now on, thanks to Dr. Davis's book. Excellent read!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Good installment of the Reacher series.  It was a little light on the action side, and I believe some of his earlier books were more thoughtful and complex.  But overall an entertaining book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|good game but it is addicting feels like you are at an arcade adults and kids alike will like this game

0761169431|4.0|My son loves to read the \\"Origami Yoda\\" books by Tom Angleberger (which is a great book for boys over eight by-the-way).  So when I saw there was a Star Wars Origami book, I jumped in and ordered it.  It is really fun and both my boys enjoy it.  I'm buying a copy for my seven-year-old nephew for Christmas.

0385344333|1.0|What?  This is a horrible book, and I love Reacher and Lee Child.  No romance, no fight scenes, no decent story.  Child needs to mature Reacher instead of making him into a bum.  If I were Reacher, I'd find Child and give him a good beating for dissing him like this.
B0072IVGRY|5.0|I CONFESS THAT I DON'T LIKE THE LAST ALBUM BORN INTO THIS.<br />BUT...<br />IN THIS ALBUM THE BAND BACK TO YOUR ROOTS.<br />SONGS THAT REMEMBER YOUR BIGGER ALBUMS... SONIC TEMPLE, ELECTRIC...<br />WONDERFUL ALBUM!!!!!<br />TO THE CULT FANS!!!!<br />AND JOHN TEMPESTA DESTROYING!!!!!!
B000FCJZ3G|3.0|Overall, I really like the book. The author does help you think about things in a different light. However, I couldn't get over all the pitches for his seminars. Really, the seminar pitches would take me out of the book, and put me into \\"commercial mode.\\" You know, when you think to yourself, \\"When does this commercial end so we can get back to the content?\\" I wouldnt let that stop you from buying the book, but just so you know, you'll get a pitch for the seminar every couple of pages.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Well done, as it unraveled over 20 years of questions about the Aliens series and leaves it open for the big WHY in another movie!! If you love Aliens saga it's a must see!

1400082773|4.0|This book is honest, and it moves with fluid and coherent writing.  It gives an interesting perspective of the author's sense of incomplete identity after being abandoned by his father when he was just a young boy.  As the book passes through the different stages of the author's life, you see an ambitious [white] mother who encourages him to succeed in school, opens his eyes to a culture that is different from his own, and teaches, by her actions, equality for people of all races.  You see loving and caring [white] grandparents who reinforce the values of racial equality and provide a home for him when his mother, who remains in Indonesia, sends him back to the states for a better education. All of these factors: the need to understand his relationship to his [African-born], Harvard educated father, his dark skin inherited from racially mixed parents, his experiences of witnessing injustice and discrimination toward people of African descent, the love and support of his grandparents, and his mother's anthropological humanism seem to have influenced the choices he made for his friends, acquaintances, and work and service to mankind.  A most enlightening part of the biography is when the author treats the reader with his fascinating personal reflections of his journey to Kenya to meet his brothers and sisters from his father's multiple marriages, cousins, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other people who knew his father.  The quest for identity comes full circle with a clearer family heritage for the author, and the circumference is propitiously grand.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|I think this is a book you must read. If you want to understand what happened, and their results, in this world, you need this book. You will enjoy it.
B00005JJX8|4.0|This movie is based on a novel by David Dodge published in 1952 that was made into a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1955. It's a light-hearted romantic thriller. The story concerns a now-retired cat-burglar jewel thief John Robie (Cary Grant), who lives in his luxury hilltop home in the French Riviera. Robie has been out of the business for several years but now someone has set up carrying out similar robberies using Robie's techniques. The gendarmerie have been totally unable to get any meaningful clues as to who is the new robber but, in view of his past record, of course they suspect Robie.<br /><br />As the police can't find them, Robie decides to try to catch the thief or thieves himself. He enlists the help of a restauranteur who was a friend of his in the French Resistance movement. However, he and his staff are uneasy because, as friends of Robie's they are all under suspicion. To further his plot, Robie enlists the help of an English insurance agent, Hughson (John Williams) to get a list of the richest and most susceptible patrons on the Riviera - clients that the new burglar would be likely to rob. Top of the `to burgle' list are Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis) and her beautiful daughter Francie (Grace Kelly). The film reaches a climax at a fancy-dress ball which provides too tempting an invitation to the new burglar who, of course, gets caught. This is an entertaining movie with a fair measure of Hitchcock's renowned suspense, but with many lighter moments too.
B004SBULWE|5.0|this is a must have app. it works brest in the kindle fire. it really saves your battery. great app!
B008S80P38|3.0|ATGH has a completely different feel from any of his previous three efforts. Personally I prefer the electro/house style he delivered on Random Album Title and For lack of... to the more varied styles and collaborations on 4x4=12. I like the structure and flow his music once had. Flow is something sorely missed on Album Title goes here. Each song for the most part stands on its own with little or no transition to the next. He makes an obvious case to evolve his sound with this record but i still prefer tracks like \\"Closer\\" which reminds me of earlier work. A few more stand out tracks in my mind but unfortunately I found myself skipping or getting bored with 1 too many.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Very interesting for a different view of some natural and unnatural history and<br />superstition that we take for granted day in and day out.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It illustrates the extremely dedicated attitude of the Navy Seals and there hard work in protecting our country. It is always good to get a first hand look at these things without the political spin. God Bless the Seals.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Very well written. Best fantasy book I've found in a while.<br />Yes, sometimes it does get a bit annoying when the story is so good in Kings Landing, for example, and you want to know whats going to happen but next chapter takes you to jon or dany... But you actually start understanding the logic behind it after a while (In truth, the first one is already like that, so you should be used to it by now). And all the plots and characters are so good that you cant really get upset about it.<br />Tyrion and Arya are very interesting characters, I'm really looking forward to see what Martin will make of them. She will be a very interesting young lady, if she lives long enough... Hopefully she will, but you never know...
1476715904|4.0|I loved this book.  I didn't know what slam poetry was so I had to look it up.  But the characters were amazing and the story was deep, and not all happy like most books are.  The emotions were extremely instense.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Our book club selected this book. Not a book I would have picked up to review but it was interesting all the way through. It is easy to follow the story line and reads quickly. I finished it in a couple of days. A definite must read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game and nice graphics<br />gets a little repetitive but still holds its charm, looking forward to leveling my home stead
1469984202|4.0|I found this book because of the ridiculous number of 5 star reviews on amazon. Frankly, it seemed too good to be true. Most of the reviews were/are extremely vague, and don't actually review the book so much as review their feelings about the book. But since it was a cheap buy on kindle I finally gave in and got the omnibus. And...I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The first book is fantastic, and really does rank up there with the best science fiction short stories I've ever read. This is 'flowers for algernon' type stuff....really well written, and it tells a fantastic story with minimal words. The reveal at the end is extremely well done, and I felt a palpable sense of loss and regret when I finished. I couldn't wait to read more.<br /><br />After the first book, the whole story devolves a bit for me. I found myself less interested as the book became more hopeful. The characters became more fleshed out and more transparent at the same time. It wasn't UN-interesting by any stretch...it was just a lot LESS interesting after such a great start. Once I finished, I actually regretted going beyond book one...though the overall story held my attention pretty well.<br /><br />So here I've come full circle and reviewed more of my own feelings than the actual review. I still think that there is some definite rating inflation going on in these reviews and that there's an effort to keep this as highly rated as possible. Whatever is really going on though I encourage anyone interested to read. I'd really like to tell you to stop after the first book...but you won't be able to. It's too good. But if you have read a lot of sci-fi, you may find yourself slightly disappointed that you kept reading.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Thank you again Lee Child for a fabulous read about my all-time favorite character, the unbeatable Jack Reacher.<br />I miss you both between the books & then race through each book far too quickly.<br /><br />The suspense is always there, the characters are full of life, the plot/storyline is tightly wound.... .sufficiently to keep me reading for many hours at a time, hard to put down!<br />Keep up the good work.<br />Thank you again for Jack ,,,,<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for keeping me up-to-date with my Amazing Amazon Kindle....... can't live without it. I bought it in USA 2 1/2 years ago in USA, read from it all the way home to Australia, & NEVER leave home without it. If I go anywhere, it's always in my handbag.<br /><br />It's back with me in Canada & USA at the moment... soooo convenient for my \\"one click\\" purchases & free previews with it's own wifi. An amazing product.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I was favorably impressed with the authors handling of the subject matter.  Of course I had heard a somewhat different angle on a lot off this material with less detail of course and Mr. Obama with a little help from the seals accomplishing the removal of Osama Bin Laden.  I admire the authors nerve as it remains to be seen how the administration destroys him.  I didn't really believe that Obama had a right to divulge to the public any Classified info he saw fit but I do know that a military man working with classified material signs on the line that he will not divulge this type info.  Of course once it has been scattered all over the airways by the media via the administration; is it really Top Secret?
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Not a bad app at all. Will definitaly be playing more of it soon glad glu could come up eith another great game
B005IQZB14|3.0|I was a little disappointed in the book - I admire that Cheryl was able to accomplish such an unbelievable feat in hiking the PCT, but the story was somehow lacking for me.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I have not finished reading. I read it mainly because my grandson enjoys this type of book and its something we can do together. It does get alittle involved with all the kings and the intrigue but guess that's what my grandson like.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|i am so addicted to this game. i can play it all day. no changes need to be made. :)
B007HGPBRC|5.0|A poignant and sensitive last book by Christopher Hitchens as his health declined.  He was suffering from esophogeal cancer.  In this very well done work he continued writing to his final days.  It is an emotionally difficult work to read.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|No reason to rate the movie itself. If you have any connection to the world at all, you either loved this movie or you're not a fanboy/geek and din't really pay attention to it. 5 Stars for the movie.<br /><br />As for the Blu-Ray set, the movie looks great. Picture is perfect on my 47\\" LCD. Sound is also perfect. I only have simulated surround sound on my TV in my small living room, but it is perfect. I can only imagine how good it is on a real surround home theater system. 5 Stars for sound & picture.<br /><br />As for the extras, this is why I give 4 and not 5 stars overall. You have:<br /><br />- A gag real, which is cute but not overwhelming.<br />- Some deleted scenes (including alternate openings and closings) which do provide a lot of insight into the characters and provide more depth to some plot points. Wish they would have incorporated them into the movie, but they didn't. The only offer them in this compilation. Though I do like the theatrical open/close better that the deleted open/close<br />- A Short film, which is kind of cute and ties into the movie a bit. Maybe for the planned TV show?<br />- Some Featurettes and tabled side-by-side features that I have not really checked out yet.<br /><br />Overall I give the extras 3 stars.<br /><br />But again, overall for everything, $19.99 for the blu-ray of this movie (you also get the standard DVD) is a great value. Just the movie alone is worth it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great book with the happy ending that I was so hoping for! I've heard rumors that E.L. James will write book 4, I hope they are true!
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I've found this little gem rather rewarding. It's easy to pick up and learn yet, hard to put down. At times it can truly be frustrating just how much ground those little spiders can cover however, when you finally beat them at their own game what a rush.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Was really enjoying the game until everything vanished after weeks of playing and building. As it is right now it is unplayable and a huge disappointment. It was fun before it tanked but cant do anything at all with it now. Customer support has been no help. Big run around.
B000068FY0|5.0|This album is fantastic. It is dynamic, and is definitely one of the greatest I have heard. Completely satisfied with the product. (Except the CD was more than a week late, but that's not Supertramp's fault!)
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I have read all of  follett's books.I, as many others, object to the price and I am aware that it's the publisher not the author that sets the price. But I'm sure am author of follett's esteem has some control over the publisher. Perhaps he didn't have control with this book, but hopefully he will with his next book. That been said, I was going to pay the exhorbitant price but with so many negative reviews, I'm going to spend my money elsewhere and wait until the price drops.
0425263908|1.0|Ok so i finished 50 shades and was dying for a similar book to read. Everyone everywhere says to read this book if you liked 50 shades. so i went right out and bought it. it is awful. i could not get into it and felt it was very far fetched in the way things took place. there wasnt enough detail either. it was like trying to cram a series into 5 pages and hope it makes sense. it just didnt grab me the way 50 shades did and it wasnt even close to being halfway as good as fifty. read on dublin street instead. its pretty good.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Retired Harold, aged 65, a shy and retiring British gentleman, receives a postcard from an ex-colleague from years ago, saying that she is dying of cancer. When he tells his wife he is off to the postbox to send a sympathetic reply, Harold doesn't come back. He suddenly has the idea that she will survive if he walks the length of the country to Berwick-on-Tweed (Scotland) and he sets off with nothing except his wallet. As the story of Harold's journey unfolds, we learn many truths about the human condition from the assortment of characters he meets on the road, and from his nightly telephone calls to his wife. A mystery unfolds about the non-communication between the two of them for the last twenty years and we gather they have lived together in a strained habit with a monumental wall between them which neither can breach concerning their son. A marvellous, unusual book, compassionate and revealing on many levels. Totally satisfying, beautifully crafted and a highly recommended read for anyone in a long marriage and of mature years.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like it I just wish the other characters would help but I just started so they may join in which would b welcomed
B007SGM084|5.0|Welcome to a different world that could be your neighbors around the corner! I am on the second book now and is good reading if you're feeling a little wicked...there is also a love story involved although unconventional in how it all comes about...or maybe it's not (:  .....Enjoy!
030758836X|3.0|I really wanted to put this book in my best-book-ever category. But it turned out to be as anti-climactic as it was riveting. This a tale of: who-done-it meets what happened meets what's-the-truth? That makes for an addictive read and I was up late at night eager to find out how the story would unfold. The story shifts between Nick's perspective during the investigation of his wife's disappearance and entries from Amy's diaries, which chronicle the couple's first meeting in NYC and the decline of their relationship over the next 5 years. It's their contrasting views of their marriage that raises all kinds of questions, one of which is Nick's involvement in Amy's disappearance.<br /><br />There are no true heroes in this story. Not in the traditional sense. One could argue that the term villain is relative in Gone Girl. This isn't a story about a nice, married couple. Ms Flynn's main characters are so well crafted, dark and complex that I understood how Nick and Amy became the people they are, even if I didn't like the things they did. The unraveling of the marriage felt real because it came in bits and pieces over the years until Nick and Amy finally arrived at a broken relationship.<br /><br />The whole thing fell down for me about 2/3 in. The big twist reminded me of the finale of a best-selling Scott Turow novel. If you've read his books you might know the novel in question and see the similarities. I was still intrigued to find out how Gone Girl would end. But the resolution hinged on a backup plan conveniently working out. Some folks can overlook it, but I can't. The premise of the story was based on a meticulously calculated scheme and to have it fall apart then \\"work\\" based on a convenient timeline flies in the face of the story's groundwork. I just couldn't buy into what the last 100 pages were selling though I wanted to because the initial story approach and the writing was very good. For me, the ending felt anti-climactic. I wasn't looking for a perfect, bow-tie ending but this felt like a hallow victory and it didn't match the story that I started with.<br /><br />That said, Gone Girl is an entertaining read and as long you don't get caught up in hyped-up expectations, then go for it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was captivated by the courage and dedication that is displayed in this book.  It gave me a clearer picture of what our military goes through to keep us safe.  I thank all of our military for their service and dedication and for all that have not returned. We definitely owe them our freedom and this book gave me a reminder of that.
B000FC146C|4.0|I just loved it. Didn't want it to end and was sad when it did! I gave 4/5 because the ending felt a little rushed to me in how it was written. I had to go back and re-read a couple of pages.
B000002LTU|5.0|One of the best bits of musical fusion ever recorded, the smooth r n'b beats with Miles jamming over the top are just superb. It's well worth a listen.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Exceeded my expectations for a free game. Is challenging and fun. It makes you think faster for each board. You can replay and better your time.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is a fantastic fictional character!  Lee Child writes about his main character with such realism that readers relate to the complex, conflicted man who is Reacher! Enjoy this storyline!
B004J4RQIM|4.0|I just received this today and of course immediately played it.  The only reason I am only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the first Hit Man was so incredible based on the musicians and singers on it.  I feel this one is just a \\"tad\\" below the first one however it is a definite must buy.  I know now  what Heaven will be like because I just heard Jackie Evancho sing Pie Jesu and that is a voice that could only have come from Heaven! All of the performances are terrific.  Hearing Earth Wind and Fire do \\"September\\"; what a treat.  Kenny Loggins \\"Heart to Heart\\"; fantastic! The tribute to Michael Jackson was great - I do hope there is a Hit Man 3.  I guess he will have to do a tribute to Donna Summer who closed this concert with of course \\"Last Dance\\".  What memories!  How truly sad!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I wish some readers of this kindle edition would stop complaining.<br /><br />I have just started reading the story and do not find the font small or the format unacceptable. My kindle is automatically set to the next to smallest font and this book script appears absolutely fine.<br /><br />Also if the price is too high then simply do not buy. One always has a choice. Just stop moaning about it.<br /><br />I will continue to enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really liked this book. Kept me on my toes but do not read it if you haven't read the first two books. If so you will not understand anything that is going on. I actually liked the whole series. I didn't like the movie, it was vague and really did not follow the book at all.
0525423656|4.0|I will be the first to tell you that I LOVED Matched. I read the entire book in one sitting. I started Matched thinking the world Cassia lived in wasn't so bad, though. I mean, it seemed to me that the citizens were well taken care of, a little bland, but well off nonetheless. As the story unfolds, you come to the realization that the world as she knows it is full of brainwashed goslings being lead around by mother goose a.k.a The Society. It's pitiful, really. They are not living, they are only existing. Everything is prescripted for them. They're not allowed to think or act or do for themselves. The Society keeps information from them so that they are vulnerable enough to be tricked when needed for it's own purpose. Decoys, all of them. It's really terrible. Enter Ky. What an amazing person he is, and full of knowledge that Cassia seems to ache for. I felt such a strong connection for these two it was incredible. Just short of my attachment to Peeta and Katniss. I don't think this series is as good as The Hunger Games. It's nothing like it, IMHO. Perhaps a little more similar in Crossed, but not in Matched.<br /><br />On to Crossed...<br /><br />I felt this book was a strong follow-up, though not as good as the first, but when are they ever? In some ways it felt like a filler, but it also felt necessary. I just feel like the whole book could have been bypassed as the only new characters it introduces either die off, or separate with the exception of Indie. I like her, she's a real trooper, even if she is a little too cunning. The only real purpose I can see for Eli and the farmer is that they will meet again in Crossed. As for Xander, I really wish he would have made another appearance in the novel, but I'm sure he will be there full-swing in the third. All that being said, Crossed is definitely worth the read, and mandatory if you intend to read the last part of the trilogy. It opens a lot of doors for possible outcomes in Reached. I'm very excited for it's release as it is only a few days after my birthday and I fully intend to snatch it up for myself.<br /><br />Happy reading. :)
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|reminds me of Mario kart wii which is a good game so guess what?!?! I love the game yup people that hats on this game clearly don't know a good app when they see ot no offense
B004GYY714|5.0|I have been using this app across a varity of devices and it functions well on all of them.  Good selection of stations and features. Easy to use and responsive.  My only regret is that it does not work when I travel to China due to the China firewall.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I bought this movie (5 Disc Set, 3D, etc.) at the beginning of September for $29.95, I just received an email from Amazon that the price dropped before I received the movie on 9/25/12 ($19.95), so they are sending me a refund of $9.95! I LOVE shopping at Amazon. The movie the Avengers, is probably one of the best Action movies that I have EVER seen. The 3D movie experience is incredible, and now I only order movies in 3D. It is a letdown for me to watch a regular movie!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book looking forward to the next 2 books.   Excited about the movie when it comes out.  Definetely gonna refer books to family and friends.

0547995660|5.0|The Giver opens with eleven year old Jonas who lives in a small community.  The elders control every aspect of the people's lives such as; marriage, children, and jobs.  Jonas finds nothing wrong in  his safe community until he is selected to be the new \\"receiver of memories.\\"  As he works with, and begins to befriend, the Giver he begins to realize how controlling the Elders are, how amazing the world from the memories are, and that \\"release\\" is not a peaceful term.<br /><br />Lowry does an excellent job setting up a book that at first demonstrates how good a safe community of \\"sameness\\" would be; with no one feeling pain, suffering, or hate.  As the book goes on she starts to show the reader that without emotions it is impossible to love, and to truly be happy.  Lowry also shows how important it is for a community to be diverse, and that everyone is their own unique individual.  The Giver is an excellent book that teaches bravery and standing up for what you believe in.  I could definitely read this book many more times.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I wanted to read this book ever since I first heard about it on the news before it came out. The author did an excellent job telling this account. It seems like everything he said was true and not just fictitious. It is good to finally know exactly what happened on that day that Osama Bin Laden was killed. Overall this was a very good book. Every American should read this book. God Bless America!

B008UTV43K|3.0|First let me say that I love Diana Krall, so why only 3 stars?  Five stars for Diana and 1 star for the engineers, so average = 3 stars.  I have every CD and Vinyl by this lady, so of course I got her latest vinyl.  For me, CDs are for the car and vinyl is for seriously listening on high end 2 channel audio in my home.<br /><br />The engineers and quality control; the mixing is horrible, the back-up musicians are louder than her voice.  Someone needs to tell the engineers that Diana is the star.  In addition, the second disc has two 'C' labels (no 'D'), and the center hole won't fit on the spindle of my Thorens TD 125 MK II turntable.<br /><br />One more item, the pressing is bad.  There is a high frequency buzz on all cuts.  At first I thought, is it me or is there something wrong with this pressing.  So I put on The Very Best of Diana Krall (vinyl) and it was flawless as usual.<br /><br />Needless to say this will be returned.  Haven't yet decided if I want to replace it and try again (I love her singing that much), or just return it for a refund.  I guess I keep thinking, can all of these issues be from a bad pressing?, I kinda doubt it.
B006O6F932|4.0|My 8 year old was extremely excited to get the High School Playset. It's an absolute hit with her. She was excited by the flexibility of the rooms (you decide the purpose) and the ease of play access. There was some minor disappointment that the gold music shown on the DJ bench won't actually stand there, but she loved the locks and lockers so that was quickly forgotten..  She liked the branding, exclaiming constantly over details from the gargoyles out front to the disco ball in the gym. This matches up nicely to the  online videos. I really appreciated the number of included accessories. It's nice to have a dollhouse arrive complete, no extra pieces to buy. Overall, a really solid gift for a younger Monster High fan.<br /><br />As a parent, I had a few issues with it. The instructions are all picture based and pretty useless. I ended up verifying I was setting it up correctly by using the box. The unit folds flat for storage and unfolds for play. There is one fragile looking hinge that attaches two sides together with one wall area just standing on it's own. The haphazard nature of this fits the theme, but I worry about that finger claw hook snapping and making the school unstable. (I foresee a repair in my future.) The stickers that came with the house arrived crumpled in the base of the box, damaging some. On the other hand, the stickers appear to be completely optional. My daughter used those remaining to personalize the lockers, desks and tables. The instruction sheet and the box give no indications for sticker use so I think this is the intent of including them. All of the parts were neatly packaged with a very nice number of accessories. The school includes everything shown (with some color variation) but the dolls. This means you need to have a small storage box planned for the furniture and accessories. Nothing fits inside the closed school (the very smallest accessories can be placed in the classroom shelves and lockers). Overall, I think it would be a huge holiday hit for a Monster High fan. I appreciate that it isn't a huge daily commitment of floor space in her room while still giving a lot of play area when opened.ge holiday hit for a Monster High fan.

0525953728|3.0|A book that has been written with the Film in mind but it's not a 'Black Hawk Down' and very definitely not a 'We Were Soldiers'. Having said that it was an easy read and it won't take you long to read it. Some very interesting facts about the SEALs. I enjoyed it and I have nothing but respect and gratitude for the author and his colleagues, but I had that before I read the book, it's just lacking something.
0316228532|5.0|I'm confused by people who complain about kindle prices not being lower. For starters they do not understand the difficult economics of book publishing [printing costs are only a small part of cost--thus only a small difference in cost]. Buying a kindle or ebook reader for cost savings isn't a wise idea--unless you plan to just read public domain books. Used or secondary market physical copies usually cost less or if they aren't it will generally be for a popular book you can buy and easily resell. So while I understand there are good reasons to own a Kindle or Nook, just getting it for saving money seems to be missing the point.<br /><br />Now we await a real review of this book...drumroll please...
B0019O6IWU|5.0|Non-Violent Communication is a must-read that empowers individuals to communicate more effectively through compassion and empathy. It is excellent for anyone who was told to hide their emotions and feelings when they were growing up. It is an excellent tool for anyone wishing to communicate better, even if it is to just listen more empathically to oneself.<br /><br />Buy this book!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved every minute of the read.  Quick read with interesting political undertones as to how we treat people, and how \\"classes\\" in society can have a real disconnect. Adventure had you holding your breath with anticipation of what next.  Enough sci fi to be fun, enough reality to be worth the time to read.

0316228532|1.0|LOL! It was funny to see J.K. Rowling try to write a book that was not Harry Potter.  The title is misleading but there is more than a vacancy that's casual.  Some may call the title artistic and witty, but I think it's quite the opposite being that Harry Potter is not in the book which makes the vacancy more than casual.  I think the book should be titled \\"The Enormous Vacancy.\\"

B005D9B26E|5.0|Prior to purchasing the Director's Cut of Quadrophenia, I had been listening to the early 90s remaster from Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MOFI).  That version sounds great, but like the other old versions of Quadrophenia, the vocals sometimes get lost in the heavy mix guitars, drums, keyboards, and horns.  I purchased the Director's Cut from The Who's official website for $99.98.  It also includes a Who t-shirt.  I don't know if the shirt is included when purchased through Amazon.  Roger Daltrey must be very happy with the way this album now sounds.  Unlike the older releases of Quadrophenia, the vocals are now at the top of the mix, as they should be.  It's a 1973 recording that now has the 2011 sound quality that it deserves.  That along with some of the most well-crafted songs Pete Townshend has ever written, affirms Quadrophenia's status as The Who's finest album.  Regarding discs 3 and 4, some reviewers have complained about the inclusion of Townshend's home demo recordings instead of studio outtakes of The Who.  No complaints here.  Townshend is well known to produce excellent home demo recordings, which provided the blueprint for all of The Who's albums.  How could you not include these recordings?  They are an essential document as to how the songs were written and developed.  The Director's Cut also comes with a 5.1 Surround DVD, 45 single of 5.15, a book, a poster, and other memorabilia.  The book is filled with photographs, a new essay from Townshend, and detailed descriptions of all the songs and demo recordings.  Please note the DVD is audio only, not video.  The real highlight of this collection are discs 1 and 2 (original album), and discs 3 and 4 (demo recordings).  Enjoy Quadrophenia 2011!
B008H6GH8I|5.0|This movie is a lot better than the latest one in live-action Resident Evil series (Retribution). In fact, both of the animation (Degeneration and this one) are very well made and better correlated with the game series. The CG is stunning in this movie.<br /><br />Things I would want to change： Ada Wong is not as sexy as in Resident Evil 4, and not as beautiful; I still prefer the look of Leon in Degeneration.(Oh by the way the actor casting Leon in Retribution really sucks! Can't they find a decent actor who can keep eyes off Ada?)
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game it is so addictive. well worth the money. only problem is there are only 3 tanks to choose. I have filled them all no more room. would like to build more. had to change my name to start all over and now they are all filled. please give us more tanks.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|When I first saw the hunger games books, I had thought that they were about a bunch of birds. but then I heard they were making a movie,so I decided to look over the book to see what the movie would be like. Of course, the movie only depicted few things in the book, but I wanted toknow the main story. First, I looked at the description on the back and read it. From that moment on, I was hooked. I could not stop reading.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|the app is very useful and gives you great insight into the life of your battery. it indictes what percentage of the battey is left and how much Internet browsing, app using, video watching or music listening time is left. a must have for my kindle.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Its a watered down version of Diablo. Its pretty sweet and free to boot! Its always a good time to battle the undead. Awesome game for when you have to blow the toilet up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading it evn during school i would hide it under my desk so that i didnt have to stop reading it
B0083GPDBO|3.0|The success on such a low budget aside, this movie really wasn't that entertaining outside of the actual telekinesis scenes. The trailer is basically the parts of the movie I enjoyed.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Just as Follett did with his previous series, this set of characters is well developed, and the manner in which he weaves their development around word events is extremely well done. Often found myself comparing portions to \\"Downton Abbey\\".  Very readable, keeps the reader's interest throughout.  I neglected some other duties to finish this, much to the dismay of my golf partners and dinner companions. Eagerly awaited the second book of this series, downloaded it as soon as available, and have just finished it also.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This does not work.  At all.  I only spent a couple of dollars to get something from Hong Kong.  Maybe that was my mistake.  It does not work.  It's a total jip.  I don't suggest doing business with these people at all.  I only gave 1 star because I had to give a star.  Otherwise it wouldn't have had any
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Picks up where Season One left all of the fans hanging, and offers nonstop drama, action, and one of the best survivalist stories to ever grace television.

B007PFD90G|5.0|\\"Where you going with that<br /> Gun in your hand ... \\"<br /> The Jimi Hendrix version of that old folk song kept rippling through my head as I was reading Salman Rushdie's harrowing, compelling, and occasionally exasperating memoir Joseph Anton.  The book itself is the story that had to be told, the story that anyone who is not a member of the infamous \\"Page 15 Club\\" but who actually read The Satanic Verses beginning to end and recognized its brilliance has always, always wanted to hear -- not to mention the millions of fellow travelers who did not or could not read the book but were incensed at the mullahs' attempted crimes against humanity and free expression. Rushdie tells the story with consummate skill, and for reasons that will be explained later in this review, it is far and away his best work since The Satanic Verses appeared in 1988.<br />To his critics, however, \\"Joseph Anton\\" had a gun in his hand. He \\"shot down\\" \\"his\\" \\"religion\\"; a capital crime, in the eyes of the misguided and inflexible. He offended The People, that hydra-headed excuse for irrational thinking embraced by his leftist friends, and in a particularly bitter passage, he explains that his situation:<br /> \\"was a tough one for the left to deal with: How should one react when the masses<br />were being irrational? Could `the people' ever be, quite simply, wrong? ...It was not<br />possible, in the thinking of socialist intellectuals, that the people had misjudged him.<br />The people could not be wrong.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Hey Joe<br />Where you gonna run, where you gonna hide ... \\"<br />The position presented here is that the Special Branch honchos orchestrating his survival in those first two or three awful years just didn't like the man, didn't like the arts or brown-skinned people or lefties, didn't understand and didn't care and didn't want to. At the official level, Rushdie reports, he was \\"treated like a naughty child,\\" and at the personal, what he went through shouldn't happen to the worst enemy of one's own choice.  An electrician in the house could compel hours of sweaty concealment behind the shower curtain, for all the world like the actually existing Joseph Conrad's secret sharer cowering in the captain's bath. An alcoholic bodyguard blabbing in a pub leads to a wrenching move and the loss of some six months' rent on a house that has been \\"blown.\\" An Indian politician delivers a ringing excoriation of an opposition colleague only to find out he was condemning \\"the wrong Salman.\\" And so on.<br />With admirable patience and self-control Rushdie takes us from the outwardly confident, inwardly terrified first days of the fatwa through the Grand Guignol of his second marriage (an operatic mashup of Der Fliegender Hollander and Lucia de Lammermoor) into the sappy, semi-happy days between 1992 and 1998, when he found love with a much younger woman of limited ambition while actually \\"moving the f[*]cking mountain\\" of hate, inertia, and excuses.  He wearily recounts the avalanche of snark sent hurtling down upon him every day by the sadistic British media (what he calls the \\"Daily Insult\\"), and is clearly hurt by those who argued he cost too much to protect (in one of the famous ironic tropes surrounding his history, The Satanic Verses made him a wealthy man).  As the 90s progress and his way becomes easier thanks to private machinations, we see the writer slowly transform, becoming stronger, braver, less driven by emotion, more informed by events taking place outside his precious literary world, more cautious, more nuanced, less needful. That last was bad news for the unambitious woman, by now the mother of his second child.<br />At any rate, almost as soon as the fatwa is officially lifted,  Rushdie leaves the knife sticking in Wife #3 and resettles in NY.<br />\\"I'm going ...<br />Where I can be free.\\"<br />Surprisingly for one who, pre-89, trashed America in his fiction, R. comes across as sincerely appreciative of this country's freedoms, not to mention the fact that the American press left him alone. However, once more he takes up with an inappropriate woman, this time an airhead fashion model who hauls him out to Los Angeles for her own purposes (the opera switches to Tannhauser). I had the pleasure of seeing R. during his stay here, when he addressed an overflow crowd one evening at UCLA; he seemed quite pleased with the world and himself at that time. None of the questions put to him had anything to do with books.<br />The memoir ends shortly after 9/11/01, when as R. quite accurately says, \\"The story of his little battle ... was coming to an end. The prologue was past and now the world was grappling with the main event.\\" That the world, in particularly the U.S. under Barack Obama, has shown little interest in grappling but a great deal in apologizing, may yet be giving the author - who wants so desperately to be Left, despite the overwhelming evidence that those on that side are not his friends - tension headaches and gut-level fear. The publication of this memoir, after all, has prompted new cries of \\"ex-ter-mi-nate\\" from plunger-limbed robots in the Middle East.<br />So what's wrong with this book? Name-dropping is its worst offense. Those who have no interest in celebritude will be mystified by the author's apparent infatuation with boldface names from Harold Pinter to Madonna.  The London/New York literary worlds have never seemed smaller, more blinkered, and less relevant to the planet as a whole as they appear in this otherwise outstanding work. Los Angeles is not just a series of restaurant names; although, to be fair, it's hard to get a decent grasp on one's environment while hanging out with airheads.<br />This is Rushdie's best book since The Satanic Verses, as I said at the beginning, because it is large, sprawling, complex, digressive, achingly witty, and honest.  While The Moor's Last Sigh and The Ground Beneath Her Feet  were brilliant in parts and largely unforgettable, the three shorter novels Rushdie has published since the millennium have not rung true. Fury was, frankly, bad; Shalimar the Clown disappointed with its surface and cliche-filled treatment of L.A., and The Enchantress of Florence dissolved into sci-fi improbability sans flair and fun.  It's painful to run down an idol, but the fatwa took its toll (caveat: there may have been a fourth book, but after being burned three times I didn't bother).  This reviewer hopes Joseph Anton will be the first of many more oversized canvases, that Rushdie's unique creativity will triumph over groundless literary self-restraint, that he will continue to explode upon the scene and rip the tops off peoples' heads for years and years to come(I myself, as must be obvious by now, have had nothing but a stump upon my shoulders for two decades). He may be a cad about women, and the worst bet in the world for a long-term relationship, but when it comes to intestinal fortitude, Salman Rushdie has grown kishkes of steel.<br />\\"Ain't no hangman<br />Gonna hang his noose on me.\\"ion the fact that the American press left him alone.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|There's nothing new, fresh or inventive with this book. The wtiting is juvenile, trite and stilted. I can hardly fathom the storyline either; it's as plausible as Julia Roberts' character in \\"Pretty Woman.\\"<br /><br />This novel was a recycled/S&M version of a Danielle Steele story. Waste of my money, waste of my time. I won't bother with books 2 & 3.
034580404X|1.0|Fifty shady characters who have little grey matter could have written this book. E.L. James' publicity team and talk show teasers got to us, and they're laughing all the way to the bank. plot?  characters? climax??????<br />One star (one/fifth) is more than it deserves.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|a nice bit of strategic thinking. serve with your favorite cocktail and drink this game up handsomely!  requires a sophisticated mind.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is a really fun game. it is super addictive and even better than the original. Would reccomend this to everyone. sorry for the cliche review
0425263908|5.0|This is a great book the storyline is awesome! I can not wait for the second and third books to come out. The characters are loveable. The end makes you want more.... The story grabbed a part of me and would not let go!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so addicting you'll love it!!  My kids love it as well.  It is very satisfying when you get on a roll and start getting perfect on every puzzle you want to get a perfect on every board.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|great book, as good as the first two. This one has a couple of twists that will keep you on edge and guessing all the way to the end of the book!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Amazing book! Really great book.  I recommend it to everyone. I finished it and now my son is reading it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read that this book was not that good, and that you had to really overlook a lot of things for the plot to be believable. After I read it for myself I don't agree at all! This is a very well written book and although it is listed as a young adults book I (39) enjoyed it very much. I recommend this book to anyone of any age.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson is one of the best biographers I've ever read.  His potrayal of Steve Jobs is a 600 page consistent page turner.  Isaacson does not fawn over his subject and the bio is not a tribute but a detailed portrait of a very complicated man.  Highly recommend.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I have seen only three different live performances of this wonderful opera.<br />It is hard to imagine that any recording could rival a live performance.<br />This film of the 25th anniversary performance at the Albert Hall in London is really a wonderful work of art in itself, providing a very entertaining way to spend an evening.<br />It is notable that this was filmed entirely in one night, and there certainly would have been some editing of the film, but there were NO retakes.<br />Everything was great - the staging, the orchestra, the voices, and of course the story is a classic.  The camera work and editing is really excellent, and makes the show almost as enjoyable as being there in good seats.<br />I daresay that this disc could be a good way to introduce young people to the delights of the musical theater.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Not a book reviewer, but a casual reader. All that I can say is that as an avid Jack Reacher fan, this book was more than disappointing. As others have pointed out, having become familiar with the Reacher character, it seems that this book was written by someone unfamiliar with him. If it was, in fact, written by Lee Child, he either forgot what made this character great or  has no interest in sticking to his characters and is just satisfying his publisher.<br /><br />Either way, I am sad to say that I am done with Jack Reacher and am looking for a new fave.<br /><br />Recommendations are always appreciated!<br /><br />Save your money and thank me later!
B001Q94TQA|5.0|I originally saw this because the red headed guy from The Commitments was in it and I really that film immensely and still do. This was a quieter, more modern view of of two musicians in a more modern Ireland and very enjoyable in a different way. I happen to like the music very much and appreciated that the story didn't follow a Hollywood map with a predictable ending.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game when I need to just relax and not think for awhile.....and it always works well. no problems with this app!

034580404X|5.0|I thought the books were great.  Once I started reading them, I could not put them down. There was a little too much sex but the story line was fantastic. I would recommend these books to everyone. (adults only)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|soooooooooo much fun!!!! just like the real thing but so much more fun. ppl who gave this a bad rating........think again cause this game is awesome. who agrees?!?!?
1400079276|5.0|If you like to read books with a straight-forward cast of character archetypes, clearly-defined conflict, and a perfect resolution with all strings neatly tied up, then you may want to avoid this book.<br /><br />If you are, in fact, sick of all of those popular fiction conventions, then DEFINITELY pick this book up.  It is easy to read, and because it is so easy to read, before you know it you are sucked up into this crazy world that looks like our own, but with the shine and inherent darkness of Alice's looking glass.  There were some pages I read and reread just because the atmosphere created was so enchantingly surreal, and, of course, there is mystery all through it to keep you turning the page, thus throwing you further down the rabbit hole.  In a sense, this book is not unlike Alice in Wonderland in that your ability to predict what comes next can never be fully accurate when the story naturally includes talking cats.<br /><br />Finally, this book's most richest attribute, in my opinion, is its ability to haunt me a week after I finished it.  The author forces you to reach your own conclusions; he does not hand feed them to you, but there are sufficient clues scattered throughout it like crumbs so that when you close the book you begin reaching for them to complete the picture. I sometimes feel compelled to pick the book up and reread it because of that, but in the meantime I think I have a new favorite author.  I just bought \\"The Wind up Bird Chronicle\\" because I want to go back to that place Murakami has created and live there for at least another 600 pages.
0525953728|3.0|It's nice to have a first-hand account of the bin Laden raid other than what the Pentagon wants us to read. And my hat is off to this author, whatever his name might be, and his companions in conducting this raid and pulling it off successfully. Having said that, I was not overly impressed with the book. The first half or more is taken up with describing his SEAL training. Frankly, I don't care about that; I wanted a detailed account of the raid. But the writing was turgid and not clear in many places. It was necessary to flip back and forth many times between text and illustrations to see just where it is that the author was referring to. I didn't see anything here that might qualify as a \\"secret\\" that needed to be kept from the public and the thought occurred to me that perhaps there is something in this book that is intended as misinformation, perhaps something about training or equipment that is meant to throw a potential enemy off the track.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Very flexible with many options. Biggest problems are the complexity of the choices, the fact that it gives many choices for input calendars but doesn't allow deleting any, &amp; the fact that it doesn't allow dragging a contract on the calendar or task.

B008HK3QII|5.0|Just received my Kindle Fire HD last week (LOVE IT!) and had not ordered a case for it. So glad I waited to be able to review this one through Vine.<br /><br />Very well made and the Kindle HD fits perfectly. The padding is just the right thickness for protecting it and it's made very well.<br /><br />Quite pleased! Wish I could have one in every color.
B00866JL96|5.0|Any fan of the Nicholas Sparks books will enjoy this movie.  Everything about this film is well done.  The scenery, the music, the acting, the story line all contribute to what it feels like to live in the south.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|As a devoted fan of the Jack Reacher novels, one of the most amazing things to me is the incredible productivity and creativity of Lee Child, who has written at least one book a year for his readers.  This is creativity that has produced absorbing, unique stories.<br /><br />This latest offering does not fail to entertain - except for one small, nagging feeling, something that has never happened before.  I got the feeling that I have read this story once already, sometime in the last 15 novels.  Reacher himself has lost none of his inventiveness and unique way of looking at each situation - but unlike the other stories, this time you could predict what was going to happen.  And that's too bad - I hope Lee Child isn't finally \\"jumping the shark\\" with Reacher.<br /><br />The storyline, which involved a domestic cell involved in international terrorism, was thinner than what I have come to expect, with the ending somewhat anticlimactic.  It almost feels (sorry, Lee) like he's marking time and taking a breather from his usual creative energy...<br /><br />I still gave it four stars, because there aren't many characters like this one, and I eagerly await the next installment.
B000001FDQ|5.0|The first installment from the legendary \\"80\\"'s metal band. Yngwie J Malmsteen's \\"Rising Force\\" does not disappoint from the masterfully performed guitar barrage's of the legendary guitar god in very well arranged and composed instrumental piece's wich comprise the bulk of the album to the blazing,screaming,hard rocking voice of Jeff Scott Sotto the original frontman this is an excellent metal album and most definitely one for the collection.
