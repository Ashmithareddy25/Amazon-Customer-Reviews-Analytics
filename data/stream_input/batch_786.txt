B0013V33DG|5.0|With this spectacular cast, specially Dessay and Florez, who cares about the set and stage design or if it was updated to 20th Century ? Bravo ROH for taping this great production. The singing and acting are really wonderful and funny. You'll never regret if you buy this DVD.
0061122416|2.0|A shepherd boy in Spain has a recurring dream about the Great Pyramids in Egypt. He consults a gypsy dream interpreter to figure out what it all means, and she tells him he will find treasure there. He meets an old man who corroborates the prediction and talks to him about following his \\"Personal Legend\\", so he sets off for Egypt, and his adventures begin...    ...And then something goes horribly wrong. The book is hijacked by an overbearing and ridiculous spiritual/New-Age message: \\"I learned that the world has a soul, and that whoever understands the soul can also understand the language of things.\\" \\"When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it.\\" It would be tolerable if those bits were just sprinkled in here and there or if they weren't presented such a blunt manner, but every page has laughably ridiculous lines, and the author seems absolutely serious about it all.    That said, I did not hate the book. I found the story to be fun, and some of its \\"life lessons\\" were poignant. For example, in Tangier, the boy helps a crystal shop owner achieve some business success, and the crystal shop owner says, \\"You are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I'm going to feel worse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I don't want to do so.\\"    The writing is clear and simple. I don't know if this is primarily due to the translator, but I found it really easy and almost refreshing. It's a quick read, so even if you hate it, you won't have wasted too much time.
B00004Z459|4.0|While the debut from Linkin Park did not offer anything significantly new, what it did provide was some brilliant, incendiary singles. From the lineage that came from Run-DMC and Aerosmith to Agit-rockers [[ASIN:B00002MZ2C Rage Against The Machine]], it was merely a matter of time before it was simplified down to angry teens venting. \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"In The End\\" are perfect examples of this, with both Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda laying it thick (\\"And I'm about to BREAK!\\"). They also pulled in the de reguir earmarks of the time, including the obligatory DJ and hardcore sampling, but did it with a heaviness that recalled metal bands.<br /><br />What is great about Linkin Park is that the adolescent fury never devolved to juvenile whining or poo-poo/pee-pee jokes (ala [[ASIN:B00004XOWM Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]). There's even a curious instrumental (\\"Cure For The Itch\\") that hinted at the growth that eventually led to the terrific [[ASIN:B000OCXMAO Minutes to Midnight]]. There are plenty of loud power chords to satisfy the [[ASIN:B00000099Y Tool]] crowd, but if you're looking for RAtM politics, that wouldn't come till later in the LP discography.<br /><br />\\"Hybrid Theory\\" was, in 2000, the ultimate peak of the whole Rap-Rock genre.  Big, loud teenaged bluster, posturing for days, and still catchy as all get-out. It also signaled the beginning of the end, as [[ASIN:B00049QKHO Korn]], Fred Durst and so many others ultimately learned through diminishing returns. In an industry where only the strong survive, Linkin Park and their debut still sound good.

The depth of the stories, as well as the richness and development of the characters easily rivals my all-time favorite series, The Lord of the Rings.

B00003A9QI|5.0|Rachel Portman does it again.  She is one composer that stands apart from the rest.  After a number of beautiful offerings, (Joy Luck Club, Emma, etc), she gives us another incredible and skillfully directed score. Whats especially great about this soundtrack, is that you can sit back and relax to Portman's music over and over and not tire of it.  I actually heard this score before seeing the film.  Of course then I had to purchase the DVD because I wanted to see the story that goes with the beautiful music.  A very moving film with music that enhances it.  I highly recommend this score to everyone who appreciates subtle themes that are gently weaved thoughout the entire soundtrack. This score RULES!
B0015KO52S|4.0|I liked the second album a lot more than their debut.  I think Jack White unleashed the inner blues rock god in him!  There is a lot more energy on the CD.  It's just raw, edgy R&B, rock and punk music all rolled into one.  His band is very talented.  I saw them in concert in Austin, TX at Stubb's BBQ and was blown away!  Buy this CD.  It will be one of 2008's top 100 list, if they still keep lists.
B0018QCXGY|1.0|I wasted $3.99 on this. The whole movie is filmed through a video camera that some idiot is carrying around through the whole movie. He doesn't even know how to hold it. Sometimes he's video taping peoples feet then you have the mid torso shots or he drops the camera on the ground. This is the whole poorly done movie. I was shocked that this atrocity was even shown in a movie theater. After watching this the only advice I have for Matt Reeves is to hang it up. I gave this a rating of 1 because they didn't have any numbers going in the negative direction.
0756404746|5.0|I picked this book up at an independent bookstore while visiting Asheville, N.C. It was among a display of \\"staff recommends\\" books. I became disenchanted with the fantasy novel genre after reading the awful first book in the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series by Terry Goodkind. \\"The Name of the Wind\\" has restored my faith in the fantasy novel. Rather than overload his book with magical creatures and ridiculous situations, Patrick Rothfuss has crafted an exciting coming-of-age (in a sense) story that I absolutely believed. With just enough science and alchemy to satisfy the intelligent reader and a hint or two of mythic beings to satisfy lovers of all things fey, Rothfuss will keep you spellbound. More than just a great story, it is very well-written and strangely, I was able to find parallels to my own life experiences in it. There is an underlying philosophy running throughout that is straightforward and intriguing. I just finished it and feel empty, craving more, sorry I'll have to wait nearly a year for the sequel. And I will buy it in hardback, something I seldom do. I love this book!

It's just solid don't cherry pick the songs.  Just let them play.  I work in a Hair Salon and we play this album alot and every one ask who is this?

I don't understand wny people complain on it being filmed thru a camcorder, this is a gamer generation and it made you feel like you were part of the movie; same feeling you get when playing a video game.  I loved it and hope they are planning a Cloverfield 2.  Try it, you will probably like it too.
B00000JQFM|5.0|i really enjoy this album, it's amazing. the guitar's nuts. the songs are technically intense, and sometimes when this happens the quality of the song suffers so that the guitarist can show off their mad skills, not so much the case with this album. all of the songs have amazing range and melody and can be listened to by the average person as just really great songs, not only by guitar students marvelling at what this guy can do, which is pretty intense in it's own right, but i'm hardly the person to talk up this guy's skill. this is more of an up beat album, not madly energetic, but calmly up beat, if that makes sense. i'd have to say that my favourite songs would be surfing with the alien and lords of karma, but quite honestly all of the songs are amazingly well done.

B0017YZIL4|4.0|...Wes Montgomery has planted the flag! This is one of the most dynamic and sonically interesting works of jazz I've had the pleasure to hear in a long time. Never really a big fan of jazz guitar, works like Bill Frisell's [[ASIN:B000005J1S Have a Little Faith]] have started to attract me to the appeal of jazz guitar, and this CD continues that trend. Wes keeps every song going steadily from start to finish, whether a soothing ballad or a rocking blues riff, with (what must be) intricate fingering at a lightening speed and nary a clue as to how he gets the strings to make the sounds they do. That's always been the epitome of jazz guitar for me: when the sound is so seamless that it doesn't even sound like strings were plucked but more like they were simply asked to sing and then do. Montgomery truly scales the heights with this work and guitar players will need to have this work as a point of reference for how high they can go, while jazz fans will want this to round out and diversify their collection.
0060899220|5.0|For anyone who's ever done any kind of commercial cooking this book, and it's earlier version, is a MUST read. I'm a retired line cook and I can assure all potential readers that Tony knows of what he speaks. For 'civilians', the avid home cook or the addicted restaurant patron, this clever work gives an engrossing, entertaining and sometimes scary peek behind the restaurant kitchen door. Chefs and cooks are, well, just people, but there is something special about people who want to please hundreds of anonymous diners; stay true to their own standards and achieve the respect of thier peers. As Tony says, it is one of the hardest, yet most rewarding, and crazy jobs in the 'every-day' world.<br />Anthony Bourdain is one of my 'cooking gods' because he specialises in classic, time-proven dishes; he knows that all the world's great food is, basically, 'peasant' food, not the titivated, sculpted, value-added 'art works' on a large white plates -- and he's a good writer. I too write -- was once a food writer and journalist -- and I know how hard it is to combine the two jobs. This work is honest, controversial yet extremely fair in its assessments of the high-pressure world of the New York and American restaurant scene, then and now. I strongly recommend that you buy this book and then graduate to Bourdain's absolutely fantastic \\"Les Halles\\" cookbook. I use it, refer to it or just fawn over it at least three times every week. With over 25 years experience under my (large) belt, his Les Halles book 're-taught' me and gave me new inspiration to take up semi-professional cooking again, just for the pure joy of producing really special, simple, dishes. Please buy all his books; Bourdain is an honest, decent and admirable cook (I hate the term 'chef').<br />(No I'm not Tony Bourdain!) Just a genuine fan who appreciates his sharing of a once 'hidden' and unsung profession.<br />William Kenneth Halliwell<br />Hobart, Tasmania, Australia

0446402389|5.0|'Child 44' is a taut, nail biting thriller that will have you shaking your head in disbelief that this is a first novel. Set during Stalin's oppressive regime, and loosely based on a real life serial killer, the story is about a police investigator who begins to piece together that a series of brutal child murders might actually be connected, even though the government will do anything to prevent this information from surfacing. Smith makes a flawed, complex, and fascinating protagonist in Leo, a man with his own secrets and issues. This is the kind of great atmospheric writing that you can completely lose yourself in.
0345495004|5.0|I have just finished this exceptional work and can only now exhale.  Such an exquisite experience as Nancy Horan provides with this telling of the intertwining lives and love of Mamah Borthwick Cheney and Wright can only be savored in its fullness breathlessly as you turn the pages, devouring each delicious and disturbing twist as the characters' changing relationship and ideals unfold.  When my Bas Bleu catalog came two days ago, the review of this book caught my eye and I called our library and learned they had it.  Having seen it on the NY Times Best Sellers list for several weeks with its rather dull description, something about Frank Lloyd Wright, I'd not been interested.  Do not be misled - this is a masterpiece that will grip and stretch you until you want to enfold these characters and their whole world - their joys, their sorrows, their humiliations, their honesty, their courage, their grace, their tenderness, their ideals - in your heart.  And you will.

0393061310|5.0|Diamond's final analysis proves a good point. Many dominant countries today are not only in Europe and East Asia, but are also ones that have been largely repopulated by the descendants of those peoples, like the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Taiwan, and Singapore. Other countries rising to power today, like Southeast Asia's \\"Little Tiger\\" economies (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines), also contain descendants of invading conquerors nearly 10,000 years ago. China and India are now back in power to their historical positions. The Eurasian continent is the only one with a advanced history since the beginning of the Neolithic or Agricultural Revolution. Look at South America, and you'll find that the Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs) are ones with mostly European-descended populations like Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, and the poorest ones are the ones with the largest indigenous, native populations like Peru, Bolivia, and Guatemala. Diamond is so right in this regard.
078617286X|3.0|The audio version reads like a bedtime story, although it soon gets into subjects that would probably bore 99% of children.  However, this style along with the brevity, make it very easy for adults to listen to, say during long commutes in a car.  HOWEVER, it is extremely inaccurate!  Most Americans will be rather shocked to learn that Benjamin Franklin lead the American Revolution, that the North was the weaker of the warring parties in the Civil War, that we have a Parliament instead of a Congress, and that Wilson conned the Germans into accepting the Treaty of Versailles (although the reader apologizes for this last huge guffaw).  There appear to be a similar magnitude of errors in the history of other countries, but I'm not as familiar with non-American history (why I got the book in the first place).  While its good that this will keep you listening, its bad that you will be hearing many false statements.
B00154GEFU|5.0|The original lineup of Asia has triumphantly returned. This is the finest album I have heard in several years. It's even better because this is original Asia's return. I've bought every Asia album over the years. Once in a while a song was good. This album is G-R-E-A-T.     The opening song \\"Never Again\\" is a big arena rock song. Great opening for this CD. The best is later in the CD. Song #8 is the second combination song:  \\"Parallel Worlds/ Vortex / Deya\\". The ending of this song is comparable to \\"Cutting It Fine\\". Song #10 \\"Orchard Of Mines\\" is the very best Asia song ever. Yes I said 'EVER'. Up to this point \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" was the best song ever.     Track 1, 8 and 10 have been repeating on my car stereo, on my work computer, and right now as I type this.     There is only one issue with the songs. They are songs which have a great sound. Don't look to deep at the lyrics. Many of the songs have repeating lyrics to the point of being ridiculous. On \\" Shadow of a Doubt\\" you'll wonder if your CD is skipping! Some issue with \\"Never Again\\". The opening of \\"Nothing's Forever\\" had a annoying trumpet sound which repeats too many times.    Summary: Asia has made me as happy as the day I received the first Asia album on tape in 82. Phoenix is worth every penny. There is no reason to debate purchasing this album.  You won't regret it if you are a fan of the original lineup. If you are a rabid fan of the Aria and Arena albums this may not be for you. This is not as hard edged or strained as those albums.    I hope Asia continues with or without the original lineup but this album shows that the original lineup is key to the creation of a truly memorable album.    Best to worst (there are no worst Asia albums...but one has to be last!)    Asia  Phoenix  Alpha  Astra  Silent Nation  Arena  Aqua  Aura  Aria
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|The more I listen, the more I like this album, particularly the riffs at the beginning of The Fantasy and the song From Yesterday has wonderful lyrics.<br /><br />None of the songs on A Beautiful Lie turned me off, which is rare for any album by any group.

B00164DWEA|2.0|So, in a nutshell, when you have a reboot, I think it's okay to expect something spectacular.  Like Batman Begins.  The Incredible Hulk is NOT incredible.    Marvel likes to say that it keeps the movies faithful to the comics.  Iron Man did just that and it was a great movie.  I don't know which Hulk comics they were faithful to, but they were certainly not the ones I have read.  Now the Hulk is created by some biological experiment coupled with some radiation.  I figure if they introduce science into the mix, then it's fair game for criticism.  And there's this idea that a infusing someone with Hulk blood will create a similar creature (this idea is close to the comics as with the She-Hulk).      The movie has Bruce Banner on the run for 3/4 of the movie.  And it's a slow run.  It's fairly boring.  Ed Norton is a great actor, but just bland as Bruce Banner.  The final 1/4 of the film was a battle that had a  few bits of the Hulk faithful to the comics (the shockwave resulting from him clapping his hands) and he says 'Hulk Smash' once.  Just once.  The rest of the time, the Hulk just roars.     The movie is just not that much better than the previous one.  At least there are no Hulk dogs in it.  And for people waiting for the Captain America cameo?  It's been removed.  There was a scene where he is seen in a block of ice, but it was removed for other content.  So, it's supposed to show up on the dvd and the web at some point.    Catch this in the dollar theatre if you are a hulk fan or just rent it.

B000RHKARY|4.0|The first album right after A Hard Road w/ Peter Green and the second after Bluesbreakers w/ Eric Clapton, this set continues where Mayall with EC and PG left off.  Though Mick Taylor may not be a PG or an EC, he does an excellent job and one can see why the Stones picked him up. \\"Oh, Pretty Women\\" is a classic and that cut alone makes the album worth having.  The rest of the record is not too shabby either!  A must for Mayall fans.

B000I0QK74|5.0|I like James Taylor. There's something about his voice that is so unpretentious, with it-is-what-it-is immediacy. I simply love his new Christmas CD. It's classic, jazz-flavored, but folksy and accessible. It's like sitting around a fireplace with your best friends. Speaking of friends, James brings trumpeter Chris Botti in for a few riffs on Winter Wonderland, and he does a cute Baby It's Cold Outside with Natalie Cole that's getting some airplay.    Taylor does a mean Jingle Bells, having a lot of fun that seems to come across through the speakers. I guarantee that you'll never want to hear anyone else's version after hearing this one. But James hasn't forgotten his roots, and Christmas music was made with his voice in mind. His acoustic guitar sets a very comfortable, season-ready mood on old chestnuts like Have Yourself a Merry Christmas. Speaking of chestnuts, check out The Christmas Song with harmonica man Toots Thielemans backing him up. And Some Children See Him almost makes a believer of me.    Remember the first winter night you tried hot cocoa... and added marshmellows? James Taylor at Christmas goes down that easy... and it feels good all the way.
B000000Y1H|4.0|..not at the album per se, but at the accolades. Only the truly musically inclined and the experts get this one. For some reason, I can't get into it. I have exactly zero music acuity and knowledge, but I own ten Monk CDs and this is one of my least favorite. I like \\"I surrender, dear,\\" and \\"Bemsha Swing.\\" Beyond that, the other songs are average to me. I give it four stars, because there are no bad Monk albums.
0385340567|3.0|I've enjoyed the Jack Reacher novels as much or more than any series of this sort.  But \\"Nothing To Lose\\" is quite a letdown.  Sure, I read it pretty much nonstop as soon as I got it, but there was nothing much on TV, my Netflix movies were still in the mail, and it was too damned hot outside to be going anywhere.  One of my biggest criteria for judging a book like this is, does the story allow easy and comfortable suspension of disbelief?  Am I always in the place and time with the characters rather than sitting in a chair reading a book?  The most skillfully written novels allow nearly 100% escapism for me.  On pages 395 and 396, when Reacher pulls a secret four-digit lock code out of extremely thin air, I burst out laughing.  Even for Reacher, this was just too ludicrous to believe at all.  I realized then that I'd been skimming along trying to get to the end of the book, not because I was so wound up in the story but because I just wanted to get it over with.  I wonder if I've read too many Reacher novels in too short a time.  I wonder if Lee Child has written too many too fast.  I wonder if I will come back to these books in a few years and enjoy them all over again, like I can with Michael Connelly, early John Sandford, Reginald Hill, and several other authors.  I also wonder if, like me, you make it a point never to read any reviews of a new book from a favorite writer until you've read it yourself.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield was and is a brilliant idea for a film, and the film as it exists is a damn fun ride. I really enjoyed it with only two spoiler-ish complaints, one small, and one as big as the \\"terrible thing\\" itself. First off, the little one. As I mentioned before, the film feels like a ride at a theme park, and in my opinion, a really fun one too. However, the movie's tone changes completely within the last 10 minutes. It's like JJ Abrams came in and told them to add some gravitas or something, so they half hazzardly tacked on an unfitting tragic ending in hopes of getting some kind of recognition as a drama, as well as a monster movie.  As it is, the end kind of feels like you're having a friendly, high spirited arm-wrestling match, and then your opponent randomly punches you in the face and declares victory. It's like, \\"Jeez, I know you wanted to win and everything, but was that really necessary? I thought we were just having fun.\\"  My big issue with Cloverfield, though, is a little less concrete. Like I said, I liked the film, I was way into the hype, and I think the concept behind the film is brilliant. But that's the thing. Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams had this great, clever, inventive concept of a \\"handycam-monster-movie\\", but failed to execute that idea for all it it was worth. Abrams has indicated as much in interviews, talking about the intersection of two different people with cameras on the bridge during the film, and how that concept might play out in a sequel. Why a sequel? Why didn't it happen HERE, dammit?! Why didn't we switch from one party's camera to the other? Why didn't anyone else besides Hud shoot footage? A lot of people, I know, felt alienated by the lack of backstory on the monster attack. How great would it have been if, at some point in the film, Hud handed the camera off to one of the Military guys, and they proceded to document more info on what the hell was actually going on? Why didn't the camera make it out of New York, to see what was going on elsewhere? Cameras don't die, as long as its battery doesn't die and it doesn't get fubarred, it can tell stories, and with this film, a camera-as-narrator approach would have been revolutionary. But they played it safe. Boo.  Anyway, watch Cloverfield, buy the DVD, it's certainly worth the used price, at least. It's really good. It's just not as GREAT as it could have been.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|Two hours of bleached-out austerity followed by twenty minutes of expressionist lunacy.  The tale of a man driven to succeed by his hatred and contempt for humanity has occasionally figured in literature (e.g., Absalom, Absalom!), but not very often in film.  Unfortunately, the director drains the juices from his story with his bone-white palette, his tamped-down emotions and his penchant for shooting dramatic scenes in long-shot (Man as a tiny figure against a harsh and unyielding landscape, etc.).  Daniel Day-Lewis has little more than a dry, rasping authority, while Paul Dano is simply bad as a revivalist preacher and his brother, a piece of dual casting that makes for enormous confusion.  Near the end, the film veers to the other extreme, with Day-Lewis acting in a florid, hambone manner that makes one blush.  It takes a long long time for this bloodless film to get some color.  When it finally does, you may wish it hadn't.

0375823352|1.0|Argh! This book makes me angry!<br /><br />His Dark Materials started off as a promising tale in The Golden Compass. I liked Lyra, liked Iorek, found Mrs. Coulter fairly creepy, and in general enjoyed the world created by Mr. Pullman.<br /><br />I became nervous in The Subtle Knife, because Lyra lost some centrality in the narrative for the (in my opinion) less interesting Will... the other characters I'd grew fond of only came in sporadically, and weren't presented as well as before... and also because the story had a rapidly expanding scope that I was worried the author might not be able to handle (what with travel between the dimensions, and a war against \\"the Authority,\\" et cetera). But, I maintained hope, knowing that middle volumes often feel like there's something missing. I trusted that things would come together in the end.<br /><br />I couldn't have been more wrong. Far from coming together, the narrative swings wildly out of control, until it winds up without a coherent plot, sympathetic characters, a sensible theme, or anything really to salvage it from disaster.<br /><br />By this third volume, Lyra's world has been completely left behind, as has Citagazze, and Earth, and we are left in realms that seem desolate, and devoid of interest. Characters we've cared for before come on as cameos, but not truly as themselves, and leave quickly. Instead of even developing strong new characters, we're just given eccentric alien races that seem to have personalities imprinted on them by virtue of the \\"species\\" they happen to be; none of them are worth a damn, or elicit a moment's sympathy. The 'Mulefa' -- Pullman's Ewoks -- are ridiculous in their conception and offer nothing whatever to the narrative, except that they give Pullman a chance to inject more strangeness, which seems to be a premium to him. Possibly worse are the Lilliputians, I mean Gallevespians, I mean Lilliputians, and yes I get it, Pullman -- they're a very proud and fierce people; I promise to remember that, if you stop repeating it every other paragraph. Maybe worse than the Lilli...Gallevespians are the Harpies, who combine the \\"species is my identity\\" concept with Pullman's special genius for dramatic, senseless character change.<br /><br />Iorek ambles into the story for no reason other than to remind readers that yes, this story has something to do with The Golden Compass, and by the time he ambles back out I wonder why I ever cared about him to begin with. Mrs. Coulter is absolutely destroyed -- it's as though she never had a character at all, and so Pullman feels free to make her say anything, do anything, without damage. Lyra, too, becomes a mere poppet, doomed to the most cliched and unrealistic description of love I've ever yet read (including a Danielle Steel novel)!<br /><br />The war against the Authority was never well-developed in this story, and so it's fitting that the ending should be so inconclusive and muddled. Who won? Who lost? Who can tell? Who cares? The plot events leading up to the ending are contrived and borderline non-sensical. I understand that, generally, it's unwise to try to read too much sense into fantasy epics, but still... Alright, so Pullman's world subscribes to the nigh-infinite dimensions theory, that every choice spawns a universe going in either direction, or something absurd like that. Fine. Then, are we given to believe that there is only one (say) Roger? Or one Lyra? Or are there infinite-many, as seems to be suggested by the dimensional theory? Lyra's world lacks cars, or any number of basic technological advances (as seems to make sense), but can devise a bomb that can detonate hair, trans-dimensionally, just by having a sample on hand...? Actually, what this bomb really does is blow up any vestige of suspension of disbelief. Lyra and her daemon can't willingly separate (it's a hard and fast rule in this universe) until they can, and with little ill effect. The author has no respect for any rules, natural, supernatural, or even those of his own devise.<br /><br />Speaking of respect, the author also has no respect for the reader -- that the reader might reach his own conclusions about anything -- and instructs us on how we're supposed to feel about things by repeating them endlessly. Lyra's method of \\"defeating death,\\" in allowing the spirits of the departed to \\"become one with everything\\" and essentially ceasing to exist, or whatever, is good. How do we know? Because Pullman continually tells us how it leaves Lyra feeling good, or how the dissolving souls look happy, and so on.<br /><br />Argh!<br /><br />I could go on, and probably for a while, but what's the point? I was hoping for more -- much more -- from this series. The first book was pretty good. Never brilliant, but pretty good, and that's usually enough. Overall, there was a chance for something special, but it's all dissolved, thrown away, and mocked in this final volume.<br /><br />It's as though a Specter has drained the life from the husk of what was once The Golden Compass, and has returned this tedious final entry, without fun, hope, or life.ernatural, or even those of his own devise.<br /><br />Speaking of respect, the author also has no respect for the reader -- that the reader might reach his own conclusions about anything -- and instructs us on how we're supposed to feel about things by repeating them endlessly.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everyone has to watch this.  If all of us in the U.S. watched and actually listened to what is conveyed in this amazing documentary, our country would become a much better place.  Heck, if Al Gore were president, our country would have been a much better place.  Any teachers should make this program mandatory for their students.  It is just so amazingly done.
B000VXLC3K|5.0|I think this is a great album and this edition does it credit.  I really enjoyed the 2nd CD also which is basically an \\"unplugged\\" concert of songs from the album.  It is very nice and most songs hold up very well.  I love the music and have a new appreciation for Carole King.
B000BCE918|5.0|These movies are classics. The pack gives you the choice of which classic you want to watch without shelling out fifteen dollars or more for each one by itself.
B0017M9ZOW|4.0|See my review of this 2-cd,remastered edition under the same title,but with a lower price.  This is possibly the import version of the album now released in the U.S.
B000RZIGVS|2.0|This is just a quick review of the chosen collection version, and not this new release, and mainly to help the newbie buyers (like me) not to get the wrong product.<br /><br />First off, SPEND MORE FOR THE EXPENSIVE VERSION! The Chosen Collection which I was unfortunatly saddled with is definatly cheaper, but the age old adage \\"you get what you pay for,\\" is true in this case. The disks are flimsy, and so thin when held up to the light you can see right through them. The picture printed on them almost looks like someone cut out paper and glued it on the disks, which only helps to cement the fact this is indeed a cheap set. The disks come in a very, very cheap paper sleeves, with absolutely no episode directory to help the viewer flip through to find their desired episode. The box itself is alright, it is sturdy enough, but the back of it gives a quick overview of the actors supposidly involved in the show, actors which I never heard of, and if are indeed in the show, are likely the extras and of no importance. You'd think it would have Patrick Stewart listed, but no, just no-names.<br /><br />I know some reviews about the Chosen Collection have stated that disks lock up, and I personally can't testify to that as I have yet to go through all of them, but after seeing the poor condition of the disks themselves, such an occurance would not suprise me in the least. As it is, the sound quality is very poor, and the picture is not the best. However, if you really don't care all that much about perfection, and merely want these shows for a relatively fair price, this set isn't too bad. But if quality is what you are looking for, and for something that will last longer then a few viewings, I'd suggest trying to buy the official Paramount version, and not this Asian Import and bootleg.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Now because this movie is coming from a novel (graphic novel?), perhaps there were things that the filmakers didn't want to tackle (and I can respect that), seeing that you might want to keep the integrity of the original source material going.    So, I don't really know if that's what was going on or...    Let me just get right down to it, but it just seems like a movie like this, would've had a LOT more fun going on with it.  I mean, when you see the Hayden Christensen character 'David' living in his terrific bachelor pad, it would've been sooo nice to see him actually getting it and seeing him buy all the stuff that's in it.  I mean, for a story like this, it's just as much as the journey as it is anything else.  It's like when someone wins the lottery, it's a cool thing to get to see them enjoy their winnings.    That, to me is what's missing with the movie Jumper.  I mean, here this character has the most incredible gift, and you never really see him use it for fun stuff.  I mean, like there's this part when he and the girl he's trying to impress are in Rome and then they are found to be trespassing and then the police arrive.  I mean, where in the screenplay could the David character NOT jump to save himself (and the girl)?  I mean, to see that kind of escape would've been sooo cool!  But then he allows himself to get arrested/detained which only serves as a plot device so that his mother (Diane Lane) can come to his rescue.    And the whole thing with the Paladins?  That seems kinda out there.  Because the people who are 'Jumpers' aren't really bad people.  If anything the Paladins seem like the bad guys because they want to kill these people who have this really cool ability--like maybe they're all suffering from 'Jumper Envy'.    Either way, I think the premise for Jumper was cool.  It's just the execution of the story, sorta left me cold.    Better luck with the second installment...

B00122M2QU|5.0|Edited/Updated 9/30/16<br /><br />After 12 long years, brothers Max and Igor Cavalera has finally reunited, this time with their brand spanking new band simply known as Cavalera Conspiracy. Their debut album &#34;Inflikted&#34; is the first piece of material that Max and Igor have worked on and released together since Sepultura's 1996 effort &#34;Roots&#34;. I have anticipated this album for quite some time, and when finally I got my hands on it and listened to it, I was very impressed with it, and it has become one of my favorite metal albums of 2008 as well. This album here definitely proves that Max and Igor play straight from their hearts which of course made them both famous in Sepultura.<br /><br />&#34;Inflikted&#34; is an eleven track, forty three minutes plus slab of beastly and brutal groove-oriented thrash metal that is filled with strong elements of death metal, as well as a good dose of hardcore/punk, and even some grindcore influences also being thrown in as well all rounded up in one awesome album. This album really reminds me a lot of early Sepultura (albums such as &#34;Beneath the Remains&#34;, &#34;Arise&#34;, and &#34;Chaos AD&#34;) and later Soulfly. Joining this four-man lineup with the Cavalera brothers are lead guitarist Marc Rizzo (who played with Max in Soulfy) and Joe Duplantier (Gojira) who handles bass duties on here, and they definitely have proven that they are great, solid musicians as well in their own rights. The production on this album which is handled by Max with some help from ex-Soulfly and ex-Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader is very solid and stellar throughout, and of course the songwriting and musicianship are also very stellar and top notch here as well. Max delivers such an aggressively excellent vocal performance here. His vocals are angry, angry, vicious, commanding, and aggressive throughout, and he also provides tight and excellent rhythm guitar playing as well, meanwhile Marc's lead guitar work is very stellar throughout, as he throws out a batch of sharp, ripping, shredding, and very memorable leads and solos through these eleven tracks. Igor's drumming on here just slaughters throughout this album, and it's also varied as well, ranging from wickedly fast, pounding thrash beats, groovy mid-tempo sections, and even some cool tribal beats are also thrown in as well, and elsewhere, Joe completes the awesome rhythm section by providing solid, flowing bass lines throughout, and he also does lend co-lead vocals on &#34;Black Ark&#34; and &#34;Ultra-Violent&#34; too.<br /><br />The title track &#34;Inflikted&#34; is one of my favorites that gets the album opened up in a no nonsense way with insanely catchy, punchy, chugging, thrashing riffs, along with catchy mosh-worthy rhythms, a very catchy fist pumping, headbanging, shout-a-long chorus, and a pair of fast shredding solo flights from Marc with some fast, pounding thrash beats to back them up. Track two and my personal favorite &#34;Sanctuary&#34; starts with somewhat of a cool action/sci-fi movie like sound effect, and then thrusts into a brutally vicious mosh pit assault all complete with intense, straight ahead, fast hammering thrash beats, muscular, thrashy, grinding riffs, aggressive vocals from Max and another awesomely memorable chorus, and there's another nice wailing guitar solo from Marc around 1:36 as well. Track three &#34;Terrorize&#34; starts off with a cool tribal like drum beat, which soon goes right into an addicting groove metal beat with catchy, groovy, grinding, head banging worthy riffing and catchy, heart pumping vocal patterns, and is also further highlighted by wild, slamming, thrashing tempos that include viciously fast, pounding drums, along with some wicked machine gun riffing and fiery, unorthodox lead work from Marc all lead by an addicting shout-along refrain of &#34;TERROR RISING, TERROR RISE, TERROR RISING, TERRORIZE&#34;!!! The fourth track &#34;Black Ark&#34; is another awesome song that also starts off with a cool tribal drum beat and it also ends with a tribal drum beat, and the song is also highlighted by some excellent meaty, chugging, grinding groove riffs and more great soloing by Marc, and awesome, mosh-worthy grooves as well. The song itself also includes guest vocals from Max's stepson Ritchie as well as he chips in by adding some beastly death growls of his own. Track five and another favorite &#34;Ultra-Violent&#34; (which features Rex Brown of Pantera and Down on bass) is highlighted by slow, heavy, sludgy, gut punching riffage, pummeling double bass kick patterns, and is also highlighted by some more faster, thrashing drum parts, faster riffing, and more killer, ripping, shredding solos to boot.<br /><br />Moving forward we have short cuts in &#34;Hex&#34; and &#34;The Doom of All Fires&#34;, both at which clock in at well over 2 minutes, with the former track being a fast, savage, angry, and aggressive thrasher that boasts ferociously fast, head decapitating riffs, and explosively fast, and blistering double bass drumming all lead by Max's savagely angry, aggressive vocal onslaughts, and the latter being highlighted by blistering, chugging, energetic riffing, and great, blistering drumming, plus more excellent soloing, and awesome vocals from Max are also included as well. Next up, is &#34;Bloodbrawl&#34; which is anchored by a heavy, old school hardcore vibe throughout with heavy, meaty, chugging riffage, and mean, heavy, stomping, pounding drum beats, plus some catchy gang-shout vocals, and some nice melodic, shredding soloing, and the song also features a really awesome and infectious melodic outro that just comes completely out of nowhere that includes some gogeously infectious acoustic strings. Next up, we have another short 2 minute plus beastie in &#34;Nevertrust&#34; which is a brutally ferocious, fast and furious thrasher that is completely overflown with savagely blistering riffage and ripping, shredding solos, and rapid fast, charging double bass drumming, and absolute ranting, rebellious, shouting yells from Max to top it off. Afterwards, we have &#34;Hearts of Darkness&#34; which is another awesome headbanger that is highlighted by catchy, chugging, powerhouse riffing, and more awesome soloing, plus some neat and nifty double bass kick fills, and also features more savagely fast, hammering breakneck tempos, and powerful, shouting vocals as well, and &#34;Must Kill&#34; is a monster of a closer that features smashing double bass drums, along with awesome, monster chugging, churning riffs, plus catchy, aggressive growls and screams, and a wickedly fantastic chorus, and we also have another wailing, shredding guitar solo from Marc as well.<br /><br />Well there you have it. Overall, &#34;Inflikted&#34; is an absolute must listen for those who fell in love with the early Sepultura, and true, we may never see both Max and Igor ever return to Sepultura again anytime soon, but there's certainly no question that this album here is definitely easily the closest thing that the Cavalera brothers will ever get to sounding just like their vintage selves together. Anyways, if you're a fan of early Sepultura, and even some later Soulfly (&#34;Dark Ages&#34;, &#34;Conquer&#34;, &#34;Omen&#34;, &#34;Enslaved&#34;, etc.), &#34;Inflikted&#34; is truly worth checking out. Of course any fan of Max and Igor Cavalera will definitely enjoy this album as much as I do. Buy this album now and get yourself INFLIKTED!!!

B00005LC1H|5.0|There are full descriptions of the episodes in other reviews. Fawlty Towers is one of the best comedy series ever produced. Every episode is composed of a number of story lines; each wrapping around the others. John Cleese said that he and Connie Booth would lay out a long roll of paper and write ideas across the length of it interweaving the ideas so that they all came together at the end into a very funny episode. The various characters are well crafted and each is at least a little insane. Cleese is a great physical actor (watch \\"The Germans\\" and \\"The Kipper and the Corpse\\").  I love David Kelley (Mr. O'Riley, the builder). He is a great character (you saw him in \\"Waking Ned Devine\\"). If you like great comedy, British or not, get this collection.  I'll bet you'll love it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Well, it is hard to describe this album. It addresses many different problems in thick layers, that may take a long time to decipher. But, this album, this band, is still relevant to this day, and i think that do not get all the critical praise they so rightfully deserve, even with their great critical acclaim. But, hey, in a world where people see \\"My Chemical Romance\\" as one of the greatest bands, who gets what they deserve?    This band is a breakthrough band, which inspired other bands such as Coldplay. This album is a hard album to follow up behind, because of the way they describe humanity with beautiful production and sounds, whether its the soul bending keyboards and guitars or Tom Yhorke's beautifully distorted voice, OK Computer is a beautiful album that shall be cherished forever.

B00177Y9ZC|1.0|This was the first Bluray movie I rented after getting my PS3, not sure why I went with this... nothing else was attractive and the name of this movie seemed interesting.  I set my expectations REALLY low, and this movie met them.    There was no real plot, no beginning and no ending it seemed.  This person just happened to be able to teleport.  In a matter of hours, he could control it.  Then out of no where, a group was trying to catch the teleporters and kill them, because the teleporters did the world harm.  But what did these teleporters do?  All this guy did was to steal some money.  Kind of petty to be killed by. Also, if you had this kind of power, wouldn't you try to do the world some good or really cause some major evil?    Anyways... no explanation whatsoever about how such teleporting phenomenon could happen... it just does.  If you make a scifi, at least support it with some wild facts.  If you choose not to explain anything, then make a worthwhile plot to engage the viewer.  This movie has nothing... maybe qualify as a teenage joke movie.      I agree effects are good.  But it was not really action packed or epic like that really shows off the bluray either.  Sadly amusing is how I might describe it.
B000SFP64M|5.0|I am at a loss for words [speaking of Jimi]. I've purchased this recording at least 4 times !!! Since it first came out on vinyl !!! The only question to ask is, Quality of the reproduction?<br /><br />YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET !!! If you buy a cheap quality reproduction ,,, it will sound like poop.<br /><br />Pay the money and get GREAT QUALITY ,,, take it from a wise man who has traversed the trials and tribulations of a ca. 60's baby-boomer !!!<br /><br />THIS CD IS AWESOME, MOST EXCELLENT ,,, IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT !!! enough said, peace
0783229526|5.0|From the opening passage, to the bitter end, Hunter Thompson's masterpiece, had me completely encased. This was so much like how I felt when reading Hemingway's 'A Sun Also Rises'. I was so blown away by both these books that I immediately gobbled up everything by Thompson and Hemingway I could find, with pretty much the same results: these two books were the best of the lot. With the exception of Thompson's 'Hell's Angels' (which was kickass) the rest of their work left me cold and flat. Even so, I became enamored with their personas. So much so, it became interesting enough to read about them, versus anymore of their work. But it matters not. Even if Fear and Loathing was the only book Thompson penned, he could have died a proud man. FALILV is that good. Life altering and amazing and with the rarity of the movie being JUST AS GOOD....I highly encourage devouring them both!
B0000931QA|5.0|MOST EXCELLENT !!! I purchased this CD back in the day when it first came out ,,, and I enjoyed it immensely at that time and it became one of my most treasured CD's - AWESOME !!!<br /><br />THIS \\"Re-Mastered\\" CD is MOST AWESOME !!!  --  Definitely it is one of my MOST TREASURED CD's of the 300 plus MOSTLY OLDIES that I have in my collection !!!  ---  I play it START-TO-FINISH ,,, no skipping around necessary ,,, a DEFINITELY QUALITY CD produced for the AGES !!!

B000LXHK2C|5.0|This movie is all about live and making the right decisions. On top of that you have great cultural humor between the French and the British. Ridley Scott knows his stuff. He created a classic with Alien and another classic with this one. I watched it already too many times, but enjoy it again and again.

B000F3A7LE|5.0|I purchased the original album upon release and wore it out. The strange diversity of musical styles was amazing to me. Then it was released on cd and some things were different and I liked it less - sorry I no longer remember those differences. Then come this remastered gem - with two discs. Ok, the first disc is the one I have loved for many years. Fripp bringing in his progressive friends and Terre Roche to produce an unbelievable piece of music. But now for the first time I can hear on the second disc Daryl Hall's vocals as they were meant to appear on the original album (D. Harry's vocals are still not available) I begin to understand what Fripp meant when the album started with \\"I think that it could be commercial\\". Imagine fripp and friends with Hall and Harry as contributors? One wonders if extraordinary things may have happened if the original Fripp concept had been realized. That is what makes this the most interesting and amazing expanded cd I have ever purchased. HA! Record company greed may have led to the production of one of the most amazing albums ever - yet one may still wonder at what might have been
B0000026J1|5.0|The 80's was such a difficult era for many artists, and very much so the decade of \\"one hit wonders\\".  Europe however, may have been known for the album \\"Final Countdown\\", but the success continued and was just as great for this album released two years later.        I was delighted to see \\"Final Countdown\\" remastered, but on that same note, I'm disappointed that we are still waiting for \\"Out of This World\\" to be remastered...  What are they waiting for???  Why isn't this classic album on the remaster list???  Does anybody know?      I feel that this album is very much in need of a revisit!  This c.d. by itself could be a greatest hits album, because it has everything from soft rock to hard rock and a few ballads.  This wasn't a sloppy production by far, and if you haven't heard this c.d. yet, you really are missing a classic album, by a classic band!          With that being said, Sony (CBS Records) Epic, or whoever has the rights to this, needs to get with the program and follow through with what they started!!!

B000UX6THK|4.0|My big complaint about the set is the sound mix.  The music is so overpowering at times you cannot hear the dialog.  I had to put on the subtitles on to catch the dialog during very important sections with the music way too loud.  There were also some technical problems with the scene selection not remembering properly when you use the \\"select episode\\" menu item. I resorted to \\"play all\\" and it always resumed properly to the last place.      *****SPOILER BELOW******                                                                                         Being a Twin Peaks groupie I waited for the full release anxioulsy.  The set is very well done except for the sound issue mentioned above.  Personally, I would have ended the show with Leland's confession and death and left out Nadine all together from the beginning. Leland's death scene brings chills to me every time I see it.        Howard

B000EULJLU|2.0|For a Tool album, this is utterly unoriginal and bland. Completely self-indulgent, it comes off as a grandiose prog-jam session by a bunch of otherwise extremely talented musicians who figured they could showcase their technical abilities instead of playing good, hard, emotional music.    I had originally considered \\"Lateralus\\" as the album that turned me off to Tool, but that album comes off as a classic compared to this one.    Oh well, at least we can credit Tool with creating the whole mallcore genre. Thanks a lot guys.
B000002UAU|4.0|Formed in the early 1960s and continuing for a little less than a decade, The Beatles were and remain arguably the single most popular and single most influential rock band of the modern era.  In 1967 the group released SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.  It exploded to the top of the music charts and remains their most widely-known title to this day, the answer the \\"average\\" person will give when asked to name a Beatles album. As such, it has a way of showing up in the top ten of critic's polls.<br /><br />In 1967 the idea of a \\"concept\\" album was still fresh and new; the idea of mixing non-standard noise into songs to create music was very much an oddity; and the combination of baroque brass and electric guitar was very much out of the blue--not to mention the extremely eccletic way in which the band draws on everything from psychedelia to English musical hall.  It was startling, innovative stuff.  But there is sometimes a difference between \\"the most innovative\\" and \\"the best\\"--and over the years SGT. PEPPER'S reputation has begun to fade.<br /><br />The album opens with three knock-outs that remain as fresh today as they were in 1967: the opening \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" a memorable mixture; \\"With A Little Help From My Friends,\\" quite possibly the best cut from the recording and certainly the best of Ringo Starr's vocals; and the ultra-psychedelic \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.\\"  But thereafter the cuts become increasingly throw-away.  \\"Getting Better\\" is nice enough, but it's pretty much McCarthy in likeable ya-ya mode, no better nor worse than a dozen other similar songs.  \\"Fixing A Hole\\" is uninspired, and \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is an expertly written and performed mediocrity.<br /><br />The line up reaches the bottom with two non-entities: \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,\\" a carny-barker sales pitch without redeeming value, and \\"Within You Without You,\\" which might best be described as George Harrison at his most self-indulgent.  The band begins to crank up again with \\"Lovely Rita\\"--perhaps not a stand out in terms of The Beatles' overall work, but charming, amusing, and memorable nonetheless.  \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" is a sonic collage that either works or not, depending on your point of view--and then there is a rally with a reprise of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and the plantive, distinctly disconcerting \\"A Day In The Life.\\"<br /><br />When all is said and done, SGT. PEPPER'S really is a sort of hit-and-miss affair, at its best remarkably fine, at its worst dismissable in an eye-rolling sort of way.  Much of the album's success was due to its timing: it was the perfect release for 1967.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been 1967 for quite a long time now, and too many of the cuts simply haven't held up well enough for the album to continue to be regarded as \\"the best.\\"  Recommended, but it you're just beginning to explore The Beatles, this isn't really the place to start.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerain with \\"Lovely Rita\\"--perhaps not a stand out in terms of The Beatles' overall work, but charming, amusing, and memorable nonetheless.  \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" is a sonic collage that either works or not, depending on your point of view--and then there is a rally with a reprise of \\"Sgt.

B00005JPNZ|3.0|I wanted to love it and classify it as great of a gem as the first 3. But something about it just didn't seem right. It was strange with the main cast in this movie looking too old for a fast-paced action movie. Parts of it did seem to parody the original series, as well as blatantly copy ideas from The Mummy, and other films. Also other parts seemed unreasonable, such as surviving the three waterfalls, and of course surviving being thrown around in a refrigerator from an atomic bomb. However, overall it was a good addition to the original series. The acting was done very well and the plot kept moving and was reminiscent of the fun action/adventure style that people love about the series for most of the movie.  Although I would not give it one or two stars it shouldn't get 5 stars, and it just misses the 4 star mark. It is definitely a solid 3 or 3.5 out of 5 stars. For any Indiana Jones fan, it is still a must have for the collection. But if you are not a fan of the series, I recommend you see Ironman this summer!
B000QUEQBS|5.0|Sometimes I wonder why I wait so long before watching a certain movie, especially one that has received praise from essentially everyone I know that has ever seen it. Such is the case with the military-themed/conspiracy thriller \\"Shooter\\" starring Mark Wahlberg (\\"Four Brothers\\") and Danny Glover (`Lethal Weapon' series). I was told from so many sources that \\"Shooter\\" is a definite must-see of a movie, yet for some unknown reason I never did get around to watching it, until recently that is. Of course, I had plenty of opportunities to watch the movie, due to the fact that I had purchased it several months back even though I hadn't seen it yet (a concept which may seem strange to some of you). Who knows why it took me so long, maybe I need to get my head examined (one of my friends sure thought so when I told him I had yet to see this movie). Whatever the case may be, when all was said and done now that I've finally taken an opportunity to sit down and watch the movie, I enjoyed every single minute of it and wished I would have gotten around to seeing it much sooner.    \\"Shooter\\" is the story of former Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), who after being betrayed by his superiors, has left the service and is leading a quiet, peaceful existence in a remote cabin somewhere in the mountains. However, as much as Bob Lee has tried to remove himself from the outside world, there are those that still possess the means to find him; led by a high ranking Colonel (Danny Glover), a mysterious group within the U.S. government believes that Bob Lee may be the one person on the planet to help them in preventing an impending assassination attempt on the current President of the United States. Feeling the pressure to once again serve his country, Bob Lee reluctantly agrees to lend his expertise; however, all is not as it seems. On the day of the attempt, Bob Lee is betrayed and wrongfully identified as the shooter by the very people he agreed to help. Now, he's on the run from virtually every government agency in the United States, and as if that weren't enough to contend with, the group that hired him is tracking him across the country to silence the one loose end that could expose their far-reaching conspiracy to the entire nation.    I've got to say that I am becoming more and more impressed by Mark Wahlberg's acting ability with each movie he makes. Not only are his skills as an actor becoming more refined, but his movies just seem to get better and better as well. Mark's performance as Bob Lee Swagger was perfect, he was full of confidence without being arrogant, appeared to be an honorable man who seemed to go out of his way to save lives at all cost, and despite being betrayed by his superiors, he still maintained a strong sense of pride for his country and the military; which was a welcome change in character traits from most of the leading roles featured in today's movies dealing with any facet of the military and/or its soldiers. Michael Pena (\\"World Trade Center\\") was solid in his portrayal of an FBI agent that becomes Bob's reluctant partner, and one of the few members of any government agency that believes that he may just be innocent after all, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Kate Mara (\\"We Are Marshall\\") plays a widow of one of Bob's military buddies from his time in the service, and becomes an ally and eventual love interest for him, serving as a means for allowing Bob to open up once more to another human being and to begin to heal from the wounds that his life and career have left upon him. Kate wasn't given as much to do in this film dramatically as she had been in \\"We Are Marshall\\", but what time she did have on the screen she made the best of, and managed to show that her character was emotionally vulnerable, yet strong enough to stand up for herself if the moment arose; instead of just being the typical damsel in distress that would generally be the female role in a film such as this. Granted she eventually becomes `in distress' so to speak, but not until she's proven to the audience that she has the means with which to protect herself under normal circumstances. Rounding out the cast are veteran actors Danny Glover and Ned Beatty as members of a secret group within the U.S. government that sets Bob up for the assassination attempt. Danny Glover has played villains a few times throughout his rather lengthy career, and each time he brings a depth and realism to each character, never allowing them to be even remotely the same in their presentation. For his character in \\"Shooter\\", Danny added a slight lisp to his character's vocal performance, and played him as someone who had at one time possibly been an honorable soldier, but life and/or experiences have jaded him so much that he is essentially nothing more than a soldier for hire to the highest bidder. Portraying the man currently financing Glover's most recent mission is Ned Beatty, in a surprisingly sinister turn as a corrupt U.S. Senator who feels he has the nation's best interests at heart, no matter how misguided he may be, and is willing to do anything to see his goals accomplished.    Critically acclaimed director Antoine Fuqua (\\"Training Day\\") delivers movie audiences yet another solid film following up his previous successes, the historical epic \\"King Arthur\\", the military thriller \\"Tears of the Sun\\", and the film that garnered Denzel Washington his first Best Actor Oscar nod \\"Training Day\\". Fuqua deftly captures the frantic action and fast-paced action sequences with the ease of an accomplished action director, utilizing quick edits that have become synonymous with today's action films; yet Fuqua thankfully avoids overusing the hand-held camera approach that has permeated most of the popular action movies of recent years (a technique that was made popular by director Paul Greengrass' massive box office success with \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\"). For a director whose early successes were found in music videos,Antoine Fuqua has definitely come a long way in the last ten years since he made his theatrical directorial debut with \\"The Replacement Killers\\", and has become yet another one of those directors whose films I greatly anticipate whenever I hear of an impending release, though I don't always rush out to see them as was the case here.    The plot for \\"Shooter\\" was surprisingly more involved and complex than one would expect from most Hollywood action films. The screenplay, written by Jonathan Lemkin (\\"Lethal Weapon 4\\") and based on a novel by Stephen Hunter titled \\"Point of Impact\\", featured plenty of little twists and turns along the way to keep the suspense ratcheted up, and the audience wondering just what exactly was going to happen next. I really appreciated how the script spent time focusing on each of the main characters to flesh them out a bit more than your standard one-dimensional action film characters generally would be; it was this type of work in a screenplay that propelled \\"Shooter\\" far above the average action movie that most action buffs love to see. Truthfully, \\"Shooter\\" could almost be considered a \\"thinking man's action film\\" so to speak. Who knows, with the success of \\"Shooter\\" maybe Hollywood will take notice and begin making more action films with this kind of attention to detail, featuring smart, well-written dialogue, surprising twists (that make sense and don't appear convoluted and convenient), and plenty of suspense and thrills without resorting to excessive violence as their only means of conveyance. If we begin to see this kind of action movie taking place more and more, maybe the action genre could gain a little bit more respect from the critics; instead, of being looked upon as films for the mindless masses that can't stand to see any kind of drama being played out, only guns blazing, fists flying, and mayhem galore, maybe there's hope in the eyes of critics for the action junkies yet.    Every single aspect of \\"Shooter\\" was perfectly mixed together, from the acting to the directing to the story; nothing was out of place or off-beat in the least; delivering audiences an incredibly solid action film that boasted plenty of pulse-pounding action, along with a hefty dose of drama, intrigue, and depth to make for a thoroughly entertaining movie experience.    \\"Shooter\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|And I mean that in a very good way! This album is amazing. Most people don't realize how much thought and creativity was put into this album. From start to finish, little tricks and twists are put into the music, things that you would have to really research to understand. Lets go over some of these tricks. A lot of the album has to do with the numbers 5 and 8.<br /><br />1. On the back of the album, you see piano keys off to the side, there are 8 white keys and 5 black keys...<br /><br />2. The CD itself has a 5-pointed star inside an octagon on it...<br /><br />3. When you open the booklet, on the first page there is a kid holding a \\"can-phone\\" (you know, a can on one side attached to a string that attaches to another can on the other side...) and you can only see 3 of his fingers. Then, on the last page, you see him holding the can on the other side and you can see 5 fingers. 5+3=8...<br /><br />4. On another page, there are 2 dominoes: one that equals 5 and one that equals 8...<br /><br />5. On another page, there is a spider (8 legs...) inside a maze with 8 openings (but no exit)...<br /><br />6. On another page, you see an Octopus (8 legs...) chasing 5 fish...<br /><br />7. Now here's the biggest and most interesting trick/twist: The lyrics for Octavarium. The song goes through all 8 songs (including itself)... Here is the excerpt:<br /><br />Our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath<br />Remove all obstacles from our path<br />*(The Root of All Evil)<br /><br />Asking questions<br />Search for clues<br />The answer's been right in front of you<br />*(The Answer Lies Within)<br /><br />Try to break through<br />Long to connect<br />Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath<br />*(These Walls)<br /><br />Loyalty, trust, faith, and desire<br />Carries love through each darkest fire<br />*(I Walk Beside You)<br /><br />Tortured insanity<br />A smothering hell<br />Try to escape but to no avail<br />*(Panic Attack)<br /><br />The calls of Admirers<br />Who claim they adore<br />Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more<br />*(Never Enough)<br /><br />Innocent victims of merciless crimes<br />Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs<br />*(Sacrificed Sons)<br /><br />Step after step<br />We try controlling our fate<br />When we finally start living it has become to late<br />*(Octavarium)<br /><br />Trapped Inside This Octavarium!<br />Trapped Inside This Octavarium!!<br />Trapped Inside This Octavarium!!!<br />Trapped Inside This Octavarium!!!!<br /><br />(End of Excerpt)<br /><br />There are probably more, but I haven't found them (or don't understand them)... But that was just the concept/packaging of the album... The music, which is what most people will be interested in is just as amazing as the concept. 8 songs that fill up the entire CD for a total of 1:15:44!!! This album is nothing less than amazing in everyway and is probably one of my favorite Dream Theater albums of all time. So I highly recommend this album to old and new DT fans! IT'S AWESOME!!!<br /><br />~cHAOS(Sacrificed Sons)    Step after step  We try controlling our fate  When we finally start living it has become to late  *(Octavarium)    Trapped Inside This Octavarium!

B00026WU82|5.0|This is a good album. From the opener track, Like A Rolling Stone too, Desolation Row, this is a non stop folk rock album classic. This album was more different at the time than past dylan albums compared too The Freewheelin this album has more rock elements too it and is more electric yet it still is a folk rock album. By one of the most essential 60s albums you can buy,<br />5/5 stars
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I personally feel that the cd was overall very strong and entertaining.  I admit that I can understand the viewpoints of both the positive and negative  reviews.  However in my opinion this cd helped solidify why Madonna still is and continues to be a shining example to others to always follow your dreams and that anything is possible.  This cd is the type of cd that grows on you each time you listen to it. With that being said here are my opinions on each of the songs<br /><br />candy shop 8/10 : a very strong song with exotic beats that would be perfect for a dance club.<br /><br />4 minutes 7/10 a good collaboration with timbaland and justin timberlake with a strong horn.<br /><br />give it to me  8/10:  an excellent pairing with pharell that makes excellent use of the drums and conveys a message that you are here to win in life and that she will continue on regardless of what others may say.<br /><br />heartbeat 10/10:  One of the best songs on the cd in my opinion. I listen to this track alot on my way to work.<br /><br />miles away 9/10: sounds inspired from love profusion but a beautiful song on how love can be appreciated even more in a long distance relationship.<br /><br />she's not me 9/10: One of my other favorite songs about a woman telling her man that the other woman doesn't compare to her but does it in a groovy and fun way.<br /><br />incredible 8/10: This song grew on me after the second listen and I like how the song praises her love in a very sensual way.<br /><br />beat goes on 6/10: Another song grower but in my opinion is a listenable song about having fun and enjoying the moment.<br /><br />dance 2 night 6/10: An ok song for mellow slow dancing moments.<br /><br />spanish lesson 7/10:  An interesting song with some spanish words in it that may not compare to la isla bonita but is still very strong and upbeat with singing about a girl who loves to fall in love and adds the catchy phrase \\"when you do your homework.<br /><br />devil wouldn't recognize you 10/10  A very strong and magnetic song about her wanting to release her lover but keeps coming back to him more and more.<br /><br />voices 7/10  A good collaboration with Justin Timberlake.  Madonna carefully crafts an original masterpiece with this song with making the listener think about the societal master and slave roles.<br /><br />All in all I think that this cd is perfect to listen to for a good and uplifting emotional boost.but keeps coming back to him more and more.    voices 7/10  A good collaboration with Justin Timberlake.

B000WCBPOG|3.0|...the music in the film was superior. The actors aren't great singers, but the music worked very well because they were singing live and in character. Believing in a song goes a long way towards selling it, even if the voice work isn't perfect.    However, this soundtrack album uses studio vocals instead of the vocals used in the film. While the performances are technically \\"better\\", it just doesn't come across as well.    Also, some of the arrangements are different. For example, \\"Hold Me Tight\\" is a nice little song that was punched up in the film by alternating between a pop-ish arrangement set in the US and a harder rock arrangement in the UK. But the track on here uses the (weaker, imo) pop version all the way through.    One more example: \\"With a Little Help from my Friends\\" is sung in the film by Max and his college friends, with Jude one of the group. It was rough sounding, but perfect for the setting and the song. On here, however, it's done as a duet with Max and Jude, and it doesn't work nearly as well.    So while I'd probably still recommend this soundtrack to those that enjoyed the movie, potential buyers need to be aware that they're not getting exactly what they heard in the film.

0375842209|5.0|Coming way late to the party for this book. I only read this in the last couple of days because we read it for my bookclub. I had put it off, because I was concerned about the YA rating, since I am quite a few years away from my YA days.<br /><br />I shouldn't have been put this off - this is just a terrific book. If there is one thing new to get from this review it's this - this book is for adults too. It's poignant, clever, and witty.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />Narrated by Death, this is the story of a young girl named Liesel, who comes to live with foster parents in a town in Germany, during the very start of WWII. She befriends a \\"yellow-haired\\" boy named Rudy, who becomes her best friend. At some point, Liesel's new family must hide a young Jewish man named Max, and throughout the book, you learn all about these characters, and how they learn to deal with trauma, heartache, deprivation - and love.<br /><br />This book is cleverly written, and you go back and forth in time, as Death narrates. Despite the subject matter, this book is so witty that you find yourself laughing out loud at times.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended. Even if you're kind of old, like me. ;)
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|So good to hear that voice again.  And she still looks amazing.  The cd is excellent.  Strong material.  Varied musical styles.  I can't believe anyone could seriously rate this 1 star.  This is a well-crafted cd with a full slate of good songs.  Hopefully this will bring in new, younger fans as well as welcoming back the older ones.
1932100385|5.0|I heard about this book when reading, \\"A Cancer Therapy\\".  I originally checked it out from my local library, but found that there was so much information, it needed to be added to my home reference library.  The science listed in this book is absolutely compelling and life changing!  I have been doing research into the link between animal based products, namely meat and dairy, and disease and this book really spelled it out using scientific data and detailing years worth of experiments documenting the relationship between the two.  This book is a MUST read for anyone.  It has literally changed my life!  We have changed the way we eat so that we could live a healthy lifestyle and enjoy this life to the fullest.  What's the point of living a long life if you're sick, in pain, or fighting a disease?  I want to live to be a healthy great-grandmother.  I also feel a responsibility as a mother and a wife to feed my family the best way I know how.  I am hoping with the information I have learned in this book, as well as others, I can train my small children in healthy eating habits and possibly prevent them from battling disease or cancer in the future.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK !!!!!!
B00007KWHG|5.0|I purchased this CD after going to see Jersey Boys with my family.  What a great CD!  It has all of their #1 hits.  After hearing it, I purchased one for my mom, both my cousins and my mother-in-law.  If you like Frankie Valli, this is the CD to get!
B000AP04NI|5.0|[[ASIN:B000AP04NI Oklahoma! (50th Anniversary Edition)]] was very good! It looked as if it was filmed in a modern-day style. I loved it and highly recommend this product to everyone! \\"OKLAHOMA your O-K\\"
B000PTYPAC|4.0|This CD is crammed with ultra-catchy, fast-paced and angsty post-punk pop rock. The boys play tight and charismatic lead singer Hayley Williams sings them just right. Though the whole album is terrific fun, my favorite tracks include \\"For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic\\", \\"Hallelujah\\", \\"Misery Business\\" and \\"crushcrushcrush\\". Paramore slows the pace of the album once, right where it's needed for the listener to catch their breath with the excellent piano-led power ballad \\"We Are Broken\\". They end the disc singing 'we were born for this' and I couldn't agree more.
0446615625|5.0|The Camel Club is cool. They're an odd group of conspiracy theorists, led by Oliver Stone, on a quest for the truth.    Baldacci weaves quite a tale that keeps your attention and is full of twists and turns.    I thought this was a great mystery thriller with a bunch of interesting characters.    This is the first Camel Club novel. The second is The Collectors and the third is Stone Cold.
0307388840|4.0|A beautiful story, for the romance in all of us. A nice diversion since I usually read thrillers and sci-fi.
0307455378|4.0|I read \\"La Sombra del Viento\\" (Shadow of the Wind) in one sitting, and thought it to be one of the best books I've read in the last 10 years.  It took me just three days to finish this one, which is supposed to be a sequel, but you can perfectly read it independently of The Shadow. I don't want to be unfair with this one, cause I loved the other one so much.  It is a good book, kept me going and interested, and found some parts very catching.  I am not giving it 5 stars cause I was a bit dissapointed with the end, I felt the author had already written too many pages and some editor told him \\"that's it, you have to end it\\".  Nevertheless, I strongly recommend it.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I love period productions.  Cranford will always be on my shelf to view again and again.  Each time I watch it I become more closely involved in the lives of those who live in Cranford.  It is not only entertaining but educational as well.  No typical Hollywood hipe here, thank goodness.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby gets into to every aspect of digital photography that is importent to me and does so with the language that makes it easy to understand.  Good job.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I liked it very much. Although it has a lot of CG (Computer Generated) scenes but the accuracy of the series is indisputable and detailed. Acting is nice and harmonized. Although I hoped they would explain the character a bit more for the first time viewers, especially foreign viewers who might not know much about the US history and its founding fathers. And a side note for those who would like to buy this; HMV & Amazon.com have this DVD set for half the price offered on indigo.ca. Don't buy it here since Indigo.ca is ripping you off again.
B0015FHDRW|5.0|After the fantastic revival of Green Day that was American Idiot, I was wondering what direction they'd go in. Instead of trying to replicate their last album, they created a new band! Now obviously this isn't the first time they've done this, but I think its the most successful effort. The energy on this album is infectious and you can tell the guys had fun recording this. Sometime bands get caught up in the self importance of their music and put too much pressure on themselves to follow a success with another success or prove they aren't a one trick pony (cough Coldplay cough) Bill Joe and the gang show they're talented musicians by simply putting out good music!

IRON MAN and Robert Downey Jr. just blew me away, and my ten year old developed a raging interest in the Hulk while at a recent science fiction convention.<br /><br />So bright and early this morning, after reconstructive nasal surgery yesterday, I took my wife and son to see the movie at 10:30.  I'd stayed away from any reviews because I wanted to see the film cold and walk away with my own opinion.  I figured being post-op would allow me to be numbed if the movie stunk.<br /><br />Instead, I got a trip back to my childhood, and a chance to introduce my son to the television Hulk I grew up with (not exactly the Marvel Comics, but close).  The second film has evidently completely done away with the previous film and leapfrogged from the television series that starred Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.  While the title shots rolled, so did a similar short backstory that echoed everything that the television series had perpetrated during the creation of the Hulk.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the serum that changed Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) into the Hulk was part of the same Super Soldier project that created Captain America back in World War II, though General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt in a great supporting role) didn't mention Cap by name.  However, that link was one more linchpin tying the Marvel/Hollywood universe together.  The cameo with Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark was another one.  There are also references to SHIELD although Nick Fury was conspicuously absent.<br /><br />After the opening credits finished and the backstory was in place, the movie jumped right into Bruce Banner's life just as it would have in one of those television episodes.  The backdrop of Brazil was amazingly beautiful, and watching Banner trying to learn the language and co-exist with the culture while maintaining his isolation was great.  The premise of a man on the run isn't a new one, but it's really well rendered in this movie.  I felt immediately for Banner's plight.<br /><br />The story seemed to move slowly at first.  I have to admit, I had a Hulk jones.  Probably most filmgoers did.  My ten year old took it in stride, though his patience was waning at the end.  We wanted the Hulk, we wanted, \\"Hulk smash!\\" echoing in our ears.<br /><br />The first taste we got of it only left us wanting more.  The fight scenes were occluded by the shadows and the darkness of the factory, but the choreography was pretty well done.  I was almost frustrated, but I knew it was early in the movie.  The monster remained just out of sight.<br /><br />Tim Roth plays Emil Blonsky/the Abomination and does a really good job though the role is somewhat truncated by needing to fit the film into a two-hour delivery.  The bits between Ross and Blonsky, where Blonsky basically sells his soul to the general in exchange for power, are well done.  Ross is a complicated character, and Hurt portrayed both sides of the man fairly.<br /><br />Liv Tyler was terrific as Bruce's love, Betty Ross.  She's intelligent, emotional, and - next to the Hulk - incredibly fragile.  The scenes she shared with the monster (especially since we know they were computer-generated and nothing was really there for her to act with) were fantastic.  I loved the scene with her and the Hulk in the cave, especially when the lightning and thunder arced across the night and scared him into growling back at it and throwing a boulder.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the fact that Banner wasn't reduced to simply being a geeky wimp.  He learned to fight, adding martial arts to his doctoral degrees, and handled himself well until he was outmatched.  This was the same kind of intelligent, resourceful Banner we got in the comics and in the television show.  Man and monster were both given time on the stage, and both worked well.<br /><br />Of course, the movie wouldn't be a Marvel movie without a Stan Lee cameo, and it was there.  I didn't expect it the way it was shown, but it was funny.  However, what would have happened to him if he drank a soda containing some of Banner's gamma-spiked blood?<br /><br />The movie paces itself well throughout, and doesn't quite become a scream-fest of action till the end.  The section where Banner meets Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), a confidant he's been doing research with on the gamma radiation, is quite unexpectedly humorous.  It doesn't last long, but Sterns's obvious fanboy appreciation of the monster before him plays well.<br /><br />Looking at all the numerous crumbs seeded throughout the movie, I knew that Marvel hopes this will only be the start of a brand-new Hulk franchise.  Betty is dating a psychologist named Leonard Samson (Doc Samson in the comic series) and Sterns is said to be set up to become the Leader (another gamma-radiation spawned opponent for the Hulk).<br /><br />I had a good time with the movie.  It wasn't IRON MAN but I enjoyed it a lot.  The Hulk is a difficult character to deal with, and I think this approach was probably the best way to take it at this time.  I was really thankful we weren't marched through another origin story so soon after the last movie.  This way we got Hulk action nearer the beginning.<br /><br />Go see the movie and enjoy.e cameo, and it was there.  I didn't expect it the way it was shown, but it was funny.

B0016AJU2C|5.0|Not to be misleading, because this is so much more than a break up album, but this has to be the best 'break up' album since Tori Amos's Boys for Pele.  Unlike Tori's album, Alanis's \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" is straightforward and accessible.  Accessible I would think for anyone who has gone through the stages of grief.  Alanis does this beautifully here. Alanis is known for her personal lyrics, and they shine through on each track on this album.  \\"Not as We\\", \\"Orchid\\" and \\"Torch\\" are tearjerking ballads.  \\"Underneath\\" is a great pop-feeling song but as a debut single it only hints at the great things to be found on this album.  \\"Straightjacket\\" and \\"Versions of Violence\\", and \\"Madness\\" (although slower), are great 'angry' songs.  \\"Incomplete\\" is sort of melancholy, sad with hope.  \\"Giggling Again for No Reason\\" and \\"Vulnerable Man\\" are uplifting and catchy.  I find myself singing along with them every time.  And \\"On The Tequilla\\" should have been on the main album in my opininon.  I could see this being a great party song. It is silly and fun enough to do so.  I am a major Alanis fan, she is one of my favorites.  I love the majority of her music, and at least like the remainder, but even at those standards, \\"Flavors Of Entanglement\\" soars above the rest.  This may be her best work yet.<br /><br />Top five tracks:  \\"Not As We\\", \\"Torch\\", \\"Orchid\\", \\"Bring on the Tequilla\\" and \\"Straightjacket\\".
B0000028M7|5.0|The first and only Alice In Chains CD I bought for years was their self titled album, the \\"tripod\\" album.  I thought it was really cool but had to be in a certain mood to listen to it.  I was pretty sure that was their best album and didn't feel the need to acquire more AIC.  But for some reason, many years later (just a few weeks ago) I was CD hunting and hunted for some more Alice In Chains.  I'm glad I did.  I was missing out on some great compositions, and more than just songs that they play often on the radio.  I ended up getting Facelift, Jar of Flies, and Dirt.  I am satisfied with all of them, just sorry it took me so long to acquire them.  AIC has a unique sound currently unmatched in today's music scene.  Sort of a winding dreary melancholy vibe, which is just what I am looking for sometimes.  R.I.P. Layne Staley.
0316067601|5.0|Ok first of all all the rangers posting on this don't be mad because SEAL training is considered harder than yours.  If you are such a bad man it shouldn't matter. Second, I agree that Luttrell is wrong about killing the 3 civilians but they should have been kept from leaving the area.  They made a mistake and I am sure that it is hard for him to deal with.  Third, this is a very good book that tells HIS story from HIS point of view, so why is everyone upset about that?  Should he apologize because his opinion is not yours? That is ludacris.  Anyway this is a very good book.
B000AL730O|5.0|2005 was a tumultous and hellish year for me, so that's one reason I missed this McCartney gem, so even though it's now 3 years old, it's brand new to me...and what a gem it is!!!! (And I'm still wearing out \\"Memory Almost Full\\"!) Just when I think McCartney cannot keep producing such great music over and over, he continuosly keeps on amazing me. It seems that this decade of the 2000s has been one of his best as a solo artist. His 1980s releases, on the other hand, seemed to have been his weakest, with the exception of the second half of 1982's \\"Tug of War\\" and all of 1989's \\"Flowers in the Dirt.\\" Favorite tunes on \\"Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard\\" for me include \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" (the understated bitter-tinged sarcasm of the lyrics is brilliant), \\"Jenny Wren,\\" \\"Friends to Go,\\" \\"Too Much Rain,\\" \\"This Never Happened Before,\\" and \\"Anyway.\\" The instrumental coda at the very end is also a great way to conclude a fine album. The man seems to have a bottomless well of fresh creativity, yet always with his signature sound. I look forward to each new release. Amazing that in such a LONG career, he can still produce music that isn't constant rehashes of past successes. Hats off to you, Sir Paul!
0156012197|5.0|If I was stranded on a desert island and could only take one book with me, it would be this one.  It does not matter how many times I read this book over the years, every time I pick it up, it is as if I was reading it for the first time.  I realize something new and profound with every reading.<br /><br />This little book is so compact with depth of meaning and wisdom, it is truly as timeless as wisdom itself.  If you know of any child, please get them a copy of this book.  It is one of those magical tales that is destined to become a lifelong favorite for them.<br /><br />No wonder it is actor James Dean's favorite book.... and I'm not one to argue with James Dean.
B000669GAI|5.0|When I bought the 2 discs cd I thought it wouldn't be about nothing. But I was sooooo wrong this is the best collection of songs by Pearl Jam I am so glad that I bought this cd. My favorites are 'Garden','Jermey' and 'Once'. I like how the first cd is set up and the second cd is its like the songs are in order. I really recommend this to anyone that into 90's alternative rock. :-)
B000K7VHQE|5.0|What a laugh riot!  This is the children's beauty pageant you always wanted to see. There are scenes in this movie that will stick in my memory providing residual laughter long down the line.<br /><br />Most movies have a very predictable storyline, progression and outcome. But this film is delightfully surprising from the very beginning.<br /><br />Alan Arkin is a treasure, and it is obvious how much fun he had playing this role. Arkin is a seasoned, veteran actor who has played many roles in his career, however I will always think of him as the porno addicted Grandpa.<br /><br />Gregg Kinnear is unbelievably funny just by playing it straight:  a \\"failure\\" trying to sell a success program. He brilliantly portrays a person who does not want to grow, and yet does, in bits and pieces, because he has no other choice.<br /><br />Any film that Steve Carell is in is worth watching.  He has such a quiet way of embodying the characters he portrays.  Every time I witness a group of people pushing a broken-down vehicle down the road, I will remember how hard he made me laugh in this film.<br /><br />If you want a guaranteed laugh out loud movie that will pick up your Spirits and brighten your day, this is a must.
0756404746|5.0|I would give this book 10 stars if I could.  I have read several hundred books (fantasy, sci-fi, thrillers, classics, you name it) and this is the best book that I have ever read (besides the Lord of the Rings Trilogy).  This story stays with you even when you are not actually reading it, your thoughts keep wondering back to Kvothe and trying to figure out what's going to happen next.  This book is so hard to put down, and by the end, I was making myself put it down to extend the time I was reading it because I didn't want it to end.  I am so sad that I finished it and now have to wait until 2009 for Day 2.  I love this book so much that I have asked for the hard back edition for Christmas (I bought the paperback) and Day 2 as a belated 2009 birthday present!  Buy the book, you will not be dissapointed!
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Any avid fan of anime, historical fiction, and Studio Ghibli films should add this to their collection.  It has great Sea plane/Pirate action sequences, and as always, the classic \\"Miyazaki, touch-of-genius\\" in every frame.       My family loves this DVD, even my four yr old can't get enough of \\"Marco Rossolini\\" and his sea plane exploits.  Wish we would've bought it sooner!    We love this middle-aged Pig and his blinding Red Sea Plane!      //the Dengler Family//
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Pulled my 1974 album out from storage as after 15 years for Dad's day my kids bought me the Emerson stereo system - which works great! This is a great rock album.  Puts today's music in it's place which is 3rd rate compared to the Bridge of Sighs. I've listened to my kids music for years and most of it can't compare to the craftsman of the 70s and 80s.  Can't go wrong with this album (CD) if you love guitar solos and great vocals. [[ASIN:B000793YUC Emerson NR303TT Heritage Series 4-in-1 Home Music System]]
B00004X01U|5.0|This is one of her best cd's!! A great selection of song to dance to and feel the groove. She delivers so much variety and her song writing is always very heartfelt.<br /><br />I bought this cd when it came out, but after many moves I seem to have lost  the original copy, so I recently purchased another one. For me, Madonna's albums are well worth the money. She always has a number of great tracks mixed in with some good ballads. Working with the best producers in the business, she delivers an outstanding album here with Music.
B000VDDWDS|4.0|I really liked this movie in the theater and on dvd.  Sound design and delivery is top notch on this blu-ray version.  The video is somewhat of a disappointment to me.  The video seems to lack the punch that I know blu-ray can deliver.  Not much is offered in the extras department.  Overall, I was expecting a little more than I received.
0792846443|5.0|Stephen King is an awesome screen writter. His movies are filled without suspense without blood and guts flying everywhere. ALl his movies are suspenseful and leave you wanting to see the next movie by Stephen King.
B00000FC5H|4.0|Earth, Wind and Fire was in a zone on this CD. You got most of the extended versions of their hits of the 70s and early 80s. I just wish \\"Devotion\\" was included on this. Still, you can't go wrong, this is THE CD to own from the group.
0786948523|4.0|I wrote an extremely lengthy review for the Players Handbook, so I will try to avoid that here.  I just want to comment on a lot of the reviews I have seen for this book (yes bad reviewer I know, I will try to make this up to you gentle-reader in the next paragraph).  Basing your ENTIRE review on the fact that the book is not the same as the previous version of the book IS NOT A REVIEW.  That is like saying that the modern version of a car looks different than a previous version, and therefore it must suck.  Yes it is okay to have opinions, and yes if you like 3rd Edition better you can point that out.  But saying monster blah is not the same as the same monster in a previous version, and thus it sucks, is dumb.  You are not reviewing a product based on it's own merit.  Now I'm guilty of this as well, see my review I wrote almost a decade ago about GURPS Mage the Ascension where I basically argue the same thing.  But seriously people, don't come here and complain that the game is different and thus bad.  Read it, argue your point, and give me some examples.  Why is it bad that the \\"angels\\" are elemental creatures not tied to good anymore?  Why is it bad that the metallic dragons are not in the Monster Manual.  When you argue that change is bad, you sound like a withered old guy, standing on a street corner, shaking his cane at the sky damning the modern world because things were so much better back in the day.  You know what people who are driving by that guy on the corner think of him?  They think he is crazy, foolish, stupid, or all of the above.  Don't be that guy!    Now back to to the regularly scheduled review.    The Good  I have never been a fan of Monster books to be honest.  While having one or two is nice, at some point it just gets a little pointless.  But Dungeons and Dragons Fourth Edition (D&D4E) is brand spankin new so you gotta start somewhere.  As a book the Monster Manual does it's job, and almost does it well.  You get stats for creatures that your party can fight at level 1, and stats for a big bad boss your party can fight at level 30.  Yes some of the monster fluff has changed from the previous edition, and some of the classic monsters are missing such as metallic dragons.  The focus of the new monster manual seems to be giving you creatures that the party has a high chance of fighting.  Which means that the classic Metallic Dragons, which are \\"good\\" and far more inclined to talk to a party than eat them, are not there.  Because seriously, how fun could sitting around having tea with a dragon be.  \\"I rolled 28 on my diplomacy check, did I make my tea to the dragons liking?\\"  \\"Yes he seemed very happy, good application of Earl Gray and cream.\\"  This is because the new D&D assumes that the party will be heroic, and slaying good dragons and creatures is not on your parties list of things to do.  What more is there to say, I haven't actually played a game of D&D from level 1 to 30 so I have only used a small portion of this book thus far.  But from what I read, good stuff so far, I like it.    The Bad  There are some creatures that are missing that I really cannot fathom.  Like they have wolves, bear, and hyena, but where are my Lions and Tigers?  Seriously Hyena beat out the great cats?  Also where are the giant bugs?  I was personally a huge fan of the 3rd Edition monster manual for the last two chapters of the book.  Lots of normal animals and then giant bugs.  Maybe I just like creepy crawlies, but I have found my players have a far greater reaction to a giant beetle or ant attacking them, than some fantastic creature.  I wish that the Monster Manual had a little more room for less fantastic threats.    Also the most innovative thing in 3rd edition monster wise is missing from the Monster Manual.  Namely template creatures.  In 3rd Edition you could do crazy things like think to yourself what if a dragon and a wolf had a date and made little baby dragon-wolf things.  It was a lot of fun, and could add alittle fluff to a creature.  Now they have some rules for templates in the 4th Edition Dungeon Masters guide.  But there are no rules for adding a little demonic, angelic, dragon, or any other taint to a creature in either book.  Considering the new rules for experience you think they could add this in, and say \\"making a creature half-dragon adds 500xp to the creature.\\"  However, with a little work, and what is in the Dungeon Masters guide, I can probably cobble something together.  So it's not a huge loss.    Yes I know \\"the bad\\" is complaining about what was in the previous edition and not in the current one.  But honestly that is all I can think off that I wish I had.  Also I hope I shared why I think this is brings the product down a little bit, instead of saying \\"1 star, no tigers and giant ants, it is the suxor.\\"    Overall    Overall it does what a monster book is supposed to do.  It gives you critters your adventurers can blow up from when they are wee level 1's, to mighty level 30's.  While the book is focused on more fantastic threats, a good party will likely face.  Overall I cannot complain, the slight short comings I saw will either be resolved with future releases, or are things I can add on my own.
B00132D808|5.0|Let's get right to the point,shall we? 'Pretty.Odd' is simply an amazing release by this band! If you think in terms of unforgettable pop tunes by the Beatles, such as 'Hello Goodbye' or 'Penny Lane' (or any number of their later output),then you're on the right track. This entire album is chock full of delightful Beatles style,hook-laiden gems! Any detractors are presumably younger folks who dug the band's debut. Although I've only heard samples,it does sound quite different in style to this second offering. And anyone under 30 possibly/most likely wouldn't 'get'/appreciate the awesome musicianship/comparability to The Beatles here. Another highly-touted 'retro-pop' band that springs to mind is Jellyfish. I've heard lots of 'sounds like' compares to their two fab cds over the years,too. Most did NOT come very close (including former members of said band). But I'm happy--no-ECSTATIC,to announce that 'Pretty.Odd' serves up the goods in spades!! Fabulous poprock music and one for the ages. Doesn't get any better than this,folks. 100 stars!! Check samples right here first,but you need this one! Enjoy, T
0743290119|4.0|Very Sex And The City esque... although the book got off to a bit of a slow start, i found myself totally absorbed not only with the 3 main characters, but with the peripheral characters, as well.  once again, lauren weisberger is hilarious and i laughed outloud quite a few times.  especially regarding \\"Otis.\\" lol<br /><br />my only complaint, albeit minor, is the way the author would reach a crescendo on a story point and the next paragraph, which you assume would continue, does not.  it skips to another character, at a different point in time, and then she would go back to that previous, pivotal point via flashback at a later time in the book.  i got used to this, and thinking back, i believe she wrote \\"the devil wears prada\\" in a similar style (but not \\"everyone worth knowing\\") however, i found it a little tedious at times as it was always at a paramount place in the story and it takes you a moment to clue-in that she's moved on and you'll have to find out later how that specific situation turned out.  if not for the overuse and curious placement of flashbacks, i would have probably rated it 5 stars but i did find that a bit jarring at times. it interrupted the natural flow of the book.  it was almost written as a screenplay for movie and you could feel someone saying \\"cut\\" and flashing to a different scene in a movie... but for a book, i felt it was unnecessary and overused.<br /><br />other than that, if you like Sex And The City, you will most certainly adore this book.  it's a perfect beach read... i just wish it had been a bit longer.<br /><br />happy reading! :)

0553577123|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating and thought-provoking books that I ever read. Ms. Frank not only gives a face to someone that lived through one of modern civilization's most horribly time periods, but she also manages to give hope to so many people. This book has touched so many lives, mine included. I have read it as a child and an adult and each time I read it I find something in it that is more fascinating and new. This is a book that everyone must read so we never forget what happened and never take anything for granted.
B000U7SN8O|5.0|I'm glad to see the revival this album has had over the last few years. I don't know why it happened but I'm glad it happened. I caught these guy live opening for Superchunk back in the late 90's and I thought they were good but I was there to see Superchunk and didn't appreciate what I had seen for quite awhile. They had just released this album so I bought it at the show but I basically just took \\"Ghost\\" and \\"Holland, 1945\\" and put them on a mix tape for my car. A while later I happened to listen to the whole album without distraction and that's when it clicked. For me the album's power and longevity lies in the idea that it is one of those albums where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I recommend this to anybody who will listen but always warn them to set the time to listen to it straight through a few times.

I recommend this book to anyone studying human rights, ethics, women's or social issues.

B00164DWEA|4.0|Man, Marvel should do this more often. First they come out with the instant classic that was Iron Man, a film that will go down in history as one of the greatest super hero movies of all time, and now they forever wipe the Hulks hands clean of the blood stains still left over from that horrible first film, [[ASIN:B00005JKC3 Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)]]. Gone are the split screens and insanely lousy action scenes, replaced by the tried and true super hero formula which made Iron Man and other hero films, such as the first two Spider Man films, so great and memorable. No, this is NOT a terribly unique film; for those who've seen Iron Man its eerily similar in both pacing and battle sequences, its really Iron Man with The Hulk standing in but that's okay, because with a movie like this I just wanted to have some super hero \\"Hulk smash\\" fun, and that's exactly what I got. I'll go see The Happening when I want twisted plot twists and suspense, but to get my action fix I go to The Hulk.<br /><br />Bruce Banner (AKA The Hulk) is on the run in Brazil. The military is after his blood, literally, planning to test it and create an army of super human soldiers to use as weapons of war. But Bruce is too cunning for them, that is until a drop of his blood falls into an empty bottle of soda at the bottling plant he works in. Tracing it back to Banners place of work (after some old guy drank the soda and dies of poisoning) the military desperately attempts to find Banner and subdue him, only to run into, ta da, THE HULK!<br /><br />I must admit that the first hour or so of The Incredible Hulk is more then a little bit boring. You only see The Hulk once and he's hidden away in the shadows and it's too dark to see with any clarity. But bare with it, although the first hour or so is VERY slow the action picks up very well from there on. Please people, but the original Hulk film out of mind; bury it in your backyard and forget it ever existed.<br /><br />Once Bruce gets back to the states and meets up with his old girlfriend things pick up from a slow dreary walk to a brisk pace, then zooms ahead into a full out sprint. The first real battle Hulk fights is with the military (who are for some reason still wearing their old uniforms, come on, the new digi camo uniforms are MUCH cooler) on the campus of some Virginia university. Although, yes, your going to have to suspend your belief more then a little here (come on, open military campaigns in the middle of a school? Humvee's and gun ships?) it is, never the less, very entertaining to watch. Don't get your brain too fried trying to figure out all the things that don't make sense, that's not the point at all, the point is just to have a good time. Plus there is plenty of hummer. One scene has Bruce and Betty are getting quite passionate with one another, only to have Bruce's heart monitor start going crazy.<br />\\"No, I can't get exited\\" Bruce says, a bit disappointed.<br />\\"Not even a little bit?\\" Betty replied. Man that was funny.<br /><br />There are a few things that didn't sit well with me though. Like I said, the whole military invading some university was a bit much, and the quirky \\"Dr. Blue\\" was more annoying then anything else. I've loved Liv Tyler since The Lord of the Rings films, but this is far from her best work, she talks in a whisper almost the entire time. Plus the ending battle was too much like Iron Man's; Iron Man fought a bigger, badder Iron Man in his film, so why does the Hulk only get to fight a bigger badder Hulk? Doesn't he have any villains of his own to deal with? I mean Spider Man didn't jump out and fight a bigger badder Spider Man, nor did Batman or the Fantastic Four (although that was an awful movie). I'm not a big Hulk know it all, I've never read the comics and have only seen a few episodes of the TV show, but surly he has better villains then \\"bigger badder Hulk guy.\\"<br /><br />Oh, and an added treat for those who saw Iron Man as well, Tony Stark makes an appearance at the end of the film, and tells the general that he's \\"putting together a team' and is interested in Bruce.

Just wait until Captain America and Thor get their shots at glory (I hear its going to happen by 2010) and we may see marvels version of The Justice League.

1416914285|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought the character development was well done. There's a little bit of everything in here. It kept a fast pace and reminded me of a cross between Harry Potter, Twilight and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Try it, you'll like it.
0060763892|2.0|Rollins certainly put together an interesting premise for a plot, but went way too far in the development of the story and the characters.  A good Sci-Fi book allows one to suspend one's belief structure to enjoy the story without raising thoughts of incredulity. (Arthur C. Clarke was the master!)  Instead, I found myself thinking, \\"You've got to be kidding\\" as the various plot sequences developed.  While I found the book interesting, it's always maddening when a really good premise is ruined by poor plot development - not to mention the typical cliché ending where everything is wrapped up neatly with a little bow in the last thirty pages.  I can't really recommend this as anything other than beach/poolside reading.

0743277465|5.0|Josh wrote a fantastic book, pouring his heart out and giving readers insight into the mental, physical and emotional reality of a top notch competitor.    I particularly enjoyed the details of the last chapter, when Josh is fighting in the finals of the Push Hands competition, describing the round by round battle.    I'm also a former scholastic state and national competitor, although Josh was a few years ahead of me.  As a chess player, I enjoyed getting insight into the mindset of a high performance competitor.  Particularly interesting was when Josh describes the mind games, and how you can use that against your opponent.    Josh writes with fantastic detail.  It's clear that he dedicated himself to writing a book that conveyed meaning on many levels.    Thanks!

B000O5AYCA|2.0|If you liked The National's other albums, pass on this one. It's slow, boring, and all the melodies basically sound the same. I bought it and have listened only to two songs more than once.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love the story of the Phantom of the Opera, and have seen it live three times. However, the movie is just as powerful, if not more so, than the theater because the movie gives you more story line and is easier to understand. This is one that will stay with you!
1577314808|5.0|I bought this book when it first came out, and I still have it and enjoy reviewing it to this day.      I have wondered at the hypocrisy of 'enlightened' people wanting to share their knowledge and at the same time collecting huge publishing royalties.  i.e. Deepak Chopra, Andrew Weil, Dalai Lama, Pema Chodron et al.  The singular fact that only Eckhart's books are sold at cost speaks volumes to the reality of his enlightenment.  Think about it.
B00005BPKD|5.0|My mother had purchased this for my daughter when she was two and half years old last summer.  As soon as my daughter went into the pool with it she took off and swam for almost an hour! The material is extremely durable unlike many pool toys out there on the market. My daughter used it all summer and had a blast. It was great because unlike most kickboards out there that are very unstable and designed for those that already know how to swim, this kickboard is almost impossible to tip over.  Unfortunatly we had left it outside throughout the winter and decided it would be best to buy a new one for the upcoming summer season.  Well we searched high and low and could not find this product anywhere!  We were relieved to have found it on amazon.com and bought it right away.  Again my daughter now 3 and half had a blast swimming all over the pool with it. In fact after a couple of weekends using it my daughter had built up the confidence to try swimming without it.  Now she can swim all over the pool without any help!  I definitly think this inflatable kickboard gave her a big boost in learning how to swim and I highly recommend it.

B000006XDX|3.0|\\"The Single Factor\\" is doomed to be tossed into the same dustbin of history as ELP's \\"Love Beach\\", \\"Big Generator\\" by Yes and many other albums that great prog bands recorded in attempts at commercial success while utterly failing to please the fans. Camel, like everyone else, had a go of it and this album was the '80's result. And yeah, this isn't anything to write home about; Camel never were able to come up with anything anywhere near commercial despite a few big hooks and a fairly accessible late '70's album called \\"I Can See Your House From Here\\". But \\"Single Factor\\" isn't the embarrassing disaster it's often made out to be, either. 'Manic' and 'Camelogue' are, in my opinion, two of the all-time greatest Camel recordings. There's decent moments elsewhere on this disc, but nothing comes close to the quality of those two tracks, which make this whole damned cd worth buying.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I beg to differ with Amazon's review of this CD. I thought it was a wonderfully coherent set played and sung by two master musicians accompanied by their more-than-capable side men. What's not to like? The Amazon reviewer didn't find this CD ambitious enough, but I loved that the set was the kind of long, unbroken groove that one rarely finds on CD's these days--a set not of unrelated pieces, but comprising one, beautifully-crafted whole. That's my take. Enjoy!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'd just like to add that there are no \\"filler\\" songs on TooL's albums.........each song has a purpose in time or \\"out of time\\"...   Otherwise this a great album(a bit different)but still TooL. Like no other............  More trippy stuff than any other TooL album but just like any other TooL album, ya gotta listen to it 3 , 4 times before you really get in to it.   Like Aenema from Aenima album , Very Good Song but took me more than a few listens to really get in to it.....uhhh, \\"See you down in Arizona Bay\\"......All about falt lines in the earth that give way the whole of California to the Pacific Ocean...hehehehe............enjoy!.. 4 .7 stars from me....   Listen to it more than once and in different frames of mind and it will grow on you.

B0018CWEYY|4.0|Lost: The Complete Fourth Season slipped in terms of storylines and the introduction of new characters. Lost is at its best with the original cast, everyone seems to hate new additions and I hate to say it but so do I. Of all the episodes from season 4, I only enjoyed half of them, maybe less. I really like this show so that's why I give it 4 stars, hopefully next season will really hit the mark. Buy this if you are a super-fan of this show, enjoy!

0143039504|4.0|My only complaint about this collection is that it is bulky and could be difficult to read because of the small print.  It is a great value though to get all of the books together.
1423101464|5.0|This book and the whole Jackson and the Olympians series is the best!  I'd recommend it to anyone. Educational, witty fastreader that kids and adults love.
0810993139|5.0|Jeff Kinney took a simple idea and turned it into a hilarious book that kids and adults will find funny.  Short passages are accompanied by stick people drawings that add a double punch of humor.  Sometimes you'll laugh at the writing, sometimes at the hidden jokes, and many times at the choice of pictures.  Diary of a Wimpy Kid will take you through one year in the life of well...a wimpy kid...his bully brother...and his semi-\\"special\\" friend Rowley.<br /><br />As a 38-year old I found myself fondly remembering my own days of \\"wimpy kid-dom\\" and some of the similar situations that our hero ends up in.  It's a fast read and you'll read this book with a smile on your face.  Then do yourself a favor and pass it along to a child from 10-15 and have them read it.
1416550518|5.0|Wonderful read about a woman who starts out \\"downstairs\\" in service in Edwardian England and recounts her life at an English estate and the lives of the inhabitants.  You will not be able to put this book down. Imaginative and unique story telling that takes you from the early 1900's to present day.

B000PKG6TE|5.0|First of all, I am an \\"old dude\\".  Tough... I LOVE these guys.  Challenging, unusual rhythms combined with cutting leads and almost angelic background vocals... is there anything this group can't do?  Imagine Primus with the Byrds as backup. Take the time to listen to this group, they don't fit any mold I'm used to and I like it.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|A very underrated film that with all thats going on the world makes for interesting viewing, the comic was written during Mrs Thatcher period in office and years later makes you think. In the UK you didnt really notice the film and Im one of the many people that found it on DVD and just loved the film.. The Blu Ray version has all the extras from the DVD but with the crisp quality and great sound. This will work on a UK Region B player and  well worth the money.
B00005JKC3|2.0|Having seen half a dozen Marvel movies, I assume that I can tell a good one from a bad one. This is definitly the worst of all six films. The  Spiderman movies and Fantastic Four movies were all first class, but this was a first class bungle. To start, the so called storyline was rather dark, disturbing, and had some very disturbing scenes(particularly the frog and knife scenes). The characters had little or no depth, the actors completely flunked, and the effects for Hulk could, and should, have been better, considering today's technology.  The action was also a major ripoff.  There should have been much more of it.  The scene of Hulk fighting the army is an overstatement because the \\"army\\" was four copters and four tanks!  The scene when Hulk was in the city surrounded by troops could have been a major battle, until Betty came in and ruined the whole thing before it got started!  Worst of all was the so called \\"final battle\\" with Bruce and his father, which turned out to be the worst one on one fight in superhero cinema. People who like this film say that we critics ( we outnumber them by the way) don't understand the story. Maybe we do, maybe we don't.  The fact is, this movie is another bright prospect gone down the drain. I hope this review helps those who want to know about this movie. Join me next time for my review on the 2006 movie Flyboys.
B0018C7Q5Q|4.0|This new rendering of The Incredible Hulk makes for good summer fun. It has a hero you can like, a girlfriend you can like even more, and bad guys you can feel good about disliking. The hero, of course, is Bruce Banner, a basically nice guy, a scientist, living life on the run. He has plenty to run from and that includes himself - but, for once, he's winning that part of the race. Liv Tyler brings girlfriend Betty to life as a strong, loving character with Tyler's unique kind of good looks. The bad guys include a military nutjob who wants to own Banner and another military nutjob who wants to be Banner.<br /><br />This Hulk had a lot to live down, because of unfortunate previous attempts at bringing the green guy to the screen. It does a fair job, too, largely because of up-to-date effects. This does have its own problems, though, like the ridiculous efforts at military action to capture The Hulk - the same efforts, again and again, no matter how often they fail. Well, maybe that is realistic.<br /><br />This time, Marvel has put its creative efforts into a fair piece of summer movie entertainment. I found it pretty forgettable, except for that sequel-bait at the end, so wait for a hot day, then sit back and enjoy the popcorn,  the air conditioning, and the movie.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
B00125WAWS|5.0|The '07 release `The Great Debaters' is an excellent production with a brilliant cast comprised of both known and unknown faces. Denzel Washington and Forrest Whitaker are superb as always and the young debaters played by Nate Parker, Jurnee Smollet and Denzel Whitaker show that they are up to the task of acting beside some of the industries best. They're intense, likeable and amazingly convincing.<br /><br />However `The Great Debaters' is more than just a great film. Since it's based on a true story circa 1935 in Texas the poignancy and urgency of the message is not meant to serve merely as a period piece on Black Americana. It's also a reminder of where we've been, where we are now and how far we've yet to travel on the road to racial equality.<br /><br />Recommended viewing!
B00005NGAL|5.0|The movie is great. It dose have a sound problem in the Pekes and the Policle song. It only happens in this song and the problem is only on the side noises. This problem has nothing to do with who you buy the movie from, it is just how the movie is made. But this should not detour you from buying it. The bonus features are amazing.
B000YABYLA|3.0|I got this as a Netflix rental, and was hoping it would live up to all it's hype, its nomination and win for best screenplay, the actors in it seemed decent and thought we had set the stage for a nice, dramatic, possibly teary moment coming of age film about a young girl, faced with a pregnancy that was not planned and a search for a couple who truly wanted a baby to start a family.<br /><br />This \\"sort of\\" is the premise for the film, which was sort of like a little bit of \\"The Ten Things I hate about You (which by the way I did love that movie) and Allison Janney plays almost an identical role in Juno as she did w/Ten Things) meets American Pie?\\")<br /><br />(watch this movie with the young kids, its got some one liners and unecessary language \\"F\\" word for a Pg-13 movie.)<br /><br />Some of the sarcastic lines delivered by Juno, just made the film more comedic than dramatic, which I thought this film should go in the way of Drama more than like a weird kind of comedic twist.<br /><br />I adore Jennifer Garner, but I dont think this role did her justice, she did well for what she was given, but could have been someone else.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, but I wasn't quite sure where the script writer wanted to go with this.  If she was going for the realistic emotions a girl and her family would go thru with a pregnancy, this definitely did not portray that.<br /><br />Thats my 2 cents, I know others have different views on this movie, but this has been mine, okay, but just not Great.  I probably won't see it again.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Coming from a disfunctional family, only mine was not this outrageous, I feel like a well qualified expert to review this DVD.<br /><br />Whoever picked the characters and the actors to portray this family should have received an Academy Award.  Steve Carell as the jilted suicidal homosexual was over the top.  Alan Arkin as a horn dog, heroin snorting, renegade grandfather who taught Olive, his granddaughter, her dance routine for the Little Miss Sunshine competition was hysterical.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the ending, but think \\"Rick James\\" and you can piece it together.  It is kind of like Joan Benet Ramsey meets National Lampoon's  Vacation with the Griswolds.  Definitely worth watching.
B00139XZF4|5.0|It's not as good as the book, but it's still a great movie.  The blu-ray transfer is excellent.
0812975219|2.0|PROS:<br />* The book argues an important message (that we underestimate the role of luck in our results/outcome).<br />* A few interesting anecdotes.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Although the author is self-deprecating at times, it smells more of false modesty rather than geniune humility (which he argues everyone should have). Most of the time (as other reviewers have noted) his arrogance comes out loud and clear, and that's annoying.<br />* Disjointed style of writing. He rambles, jumps around, and writes in awkward sentences. The writing doesn't flow easily.<br />* Disorganized. He proclaims that he doesn't like to use headers that tell the reader much about what is coming up. For non-fiction books, I prefer clarity, rather than cuteness.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: There are brief moments of brilliance and lucidness, brief moments when you think the book is really going to be worth reading, and then it quickly vanishes. Unfortunately, it's also a hard book to skim. I don't recommend it.
0670020745|5.0|My wife is a \\"massive\\" stroke victim. Her survival and recovery themselves were miracles. We are very fortunate. But one of the god-given gifts that has not returned is her speech. And while as a husband of 45 years when asked how she is doing often  facetiously say that her loss of speech \\"is not all bad\\", I feel for her occasional frustration as she stumbles in her attempt to convey her feelings - fortunately, it is only occasional. We were warned it would be much, much worse.     But the bottom line, this book has restored her faith in the possibilities of even further recovery. It should be required reading for all  stoke victims whose speech was affected. Likewise, for all caretakers of those victims. For just to see the light shine in her eye as she showed me many passages in the book that still gave her hope was well worth the price and time involved.
1878424505|5.0|I have read this book three times. I even used to carry a small version in my bookbag when i was in college. This time i ordered it for my fiance but i have been rereading it again too.
0786838655|4.0|Several aspects of this book can be found, to a certain extent, in other stories.  Percy learns that a world he thought was only from ancient mythological tales is indeed very much real and present, and that he is part of those \\"mythologies\\" now.  He's got to learn about a new world and his place in it.  He must face the fact that he's got to help save the world.  And he gains a few friends to help him along the way.  That said, a good deal of the concepts are pretty standard for many tales, and are pretty necessary for this type of book.  So, while at times I felt a little like I'd read these things before, I don't really think that should (or did) take too much away from the story.  The uniqueness of the story is helped greatly by the fact that it isn't a fantasy story like I typically consider fantasy - instead it focuses on mythology, dealing with titans and gods and heros.    I think the author did a pretty good job of making the characters 3-dimensional, and the plot multi-faceted. I did think that certain traits and decisions could have stood a little more exploration or explanation, but overall I felt things fit together well.  The only thing that really bothered me was the lightness that certain deaths were taken with.  While the gravity of killing someone (no matter how bad) is touched upon, I didn't feel that it was explored quite enough.  All in all it's a pretty fun read, and I'm sure even more fun if you have a better understanding of gods and titans, etc., than I do - though now I must admit I'm curious to do some research!
0307394549|5.0|This is a wonderful cookie book. The recipes are clear and diverse, with so many choices and yet nothing so bizarre as to make you think it shouldn't have been included. There are also some unique & new cookies (well they are to me, at least), like the stained glass christmas trees, and the little umbrella-shaped lemon cookies. Cute, and clever ideas.   The format is lovely, with lots of beautiful photographs for all the cookies.   Hats off to Martha, she is a perfectionist and it shows in her work. There is no great baking expertise required, but some of the recipes are more complicated and/or challenging than others. (I offer that opinion as someone who is not really a great baker or one who particularly enjoys baking.) I would think that anyone who likes cookies would appreciate this book!

0743277465|5.0|This book is a personal story of the path to excellence spanning two seemingly divergent fields:  Chess and Tai Chi.  It covers his early success in Chess, his withdrawl from the associated pressure, and his eventual persuit of personal excellence in the martial arts.  Waltzkin's story belongs in the pantheon of personal development books somewhere between Covey's 7 Habits and Leonard's Mastery.  It has useful tips and tools for people looking for long term improvement in most any field.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Jumper is about a young man that finds out that he has a special power when he's little. He leaves his father (Michael Rooker) and his best friend (Rachel Bilson) to go rob banks with his teleporting power and live alone.<br /><br />  8 years later he finds her again and she agrees to go to Rome with him just like that. As if he's not lucky enough that a hot girl like Rachel Bilson is still single.<br /><br />  While an agent played by Samuel L. Jackson wants to kill him just because \\"only god should have this power\\" he explains. A better explanation would have been \\"because I'm one bad Motha....and the movie needed a villain\\".<br /><br />  Another Jumper \\"well played by Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell\\" follows Hayden's Jumper around because he's using him as bait. He hunts the Jumper killers and knows they are after Christensen. That's what I guess anyway since the movie never explains why he's following him.<br /><br />  Jumper has a lot of energy and some nice locations and some cool moments. The script is thin though. It's a wannabe super hero movie and that's about it. I'd rather just see a teleporter movie with Alan Cummings as Night Crawler again.<br /><br />  Jumper never explains how Jumpers become Jumpers. While Jackson's excuse for killing them just wasn't a good enough excuse. He says most Jumpers become bad and that only god should have this power \\"one of his worse lines he has ever had to utter\\". Yet not one Jumper we meet in the movie even seems evil.  They wanna teleport to other countries, rob banks with no one getting hurt and...surf.<br /><br />  Plus for a Doug Liman (Go, Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mr.s Smith) movie it's totally disappointing.It makes even Mr. and Mr.s Smith look fantastic. I didn't even know he directed the movie until after I saw it. You'd think that someone less talented made it. I actually thought that he only produced it.

Clear booklet & fantastic sound.
0446402389|5.0|Great book, great debut. I say this without having had the luxury of finishing it. Why? The next page (in my 1st edition)after pg.312 is pg.281! This duplication of pages continues through to page 312. The next page after the 'second' pg. 312 is pg. 345. So, I am missing pages 313-344. Has anyone else experienced this? It would be easy to make an exchange at any Borders (or I can return it to Amazon) but I wonder if there may be any future value to this type of error.  Any thoughts? Thanks...and Happy Father's Day. -- Wojo
B0018CWEYY|4.0|If it's May (or afterward) then it means you've missed another great season of Lost, maybe the penultimate of seasons.  One more (likely disappointing and unfathomable, but still impossible to miss) season is in the offing, and this is your last chance to get up to speed.    LOST follows the hapless survivors of Oceanic 815, a flight that crashes on an enigmatic pacific island both exotic and menacing.  On this island, the sick and dying become healthy, the weak become strong, time and space lose their linear meanings and the line between the living and the dead blurs.  The survivors, dwindling in number, must contend both with a mysterious monster apparently made of smoke, and the island's existing residents, an implacable and ruthless band known as the others.    LAST YEAR ON LOST:  Rescue appears at hand - a boat, presumably sent by Penny, Desmond Hume's lover, has found the island.  As the Others melt into the island Ben Linus, their leader (AKA, Fake Henry Gale) foolishly approaches Jack Schepard, begging him not to trust their would-be rescuers.  Surprisingly, John Locke - previously left for dead by Linus - appears to echo his would be killer.  And then the story flash-forwards (a first in a series based on flash-backs) and we see Jack back to the real-world (so to speak).  Jack is consumed by an addiction to pain killers and a compulsion to return to the island which is somehow unreachable.  Salvation hasn't been kind to Jack who is now a wreck.  Now that we know that somebody was rescued, the only question is who survived? What happened?  The stage is set for the tragic circumstances of the rescue of Oceanic 815.    TONIGHT ON LOST  It only covers a few days, but flashbacks (forwards) make it feel like 14 weeks have gone by.  Several rescuers appear on the island, though it's unclear as to whether they mean the Lost of 815 any good.  Jack and John have already split the survivors into two camps, but civil war is averted when armed guerrillas appear on the island to capture Ben and splatter anybody who gets in their way (or anybody else for that matter).  Ben has a few tricks up his sleeve, one of which involves a spy on the \\"rescue\\" ship    In the future, we see that Hurley is unhinged again, while Sayyid has enlisted as some sort of spy working for...well, why spoil that?  Kate has her day in court, or does she?  Jack is back to looking like his jovial self, though we'll see the growing demons that will turn him into messed up Jack seen at the end of last season.  We get a great episode for Hume in which his life suddenly comes to resemble a LOST script - and he finds himself being tossed back and forth through time.  Expanded character studies of Ben Linus make him a formidable character (and just more formidable in general).  We also see greater roles for the powerful Mr. Widmore and vulnerable Juliet Burke.    What didn't work:  This was a shorter season than usual (writer's strike?) and boy will you feel it, so we don't get the same great arcs and plot lines of past seasons.  Also, while we get to see our favorite characters, we don't get as much bout their dual nature as in the past (Juliet gets a lot of time, then disappears - it's clear that some of the LOST still don't trust her, but we've lost reason to doubt her).  The show almost completely passes up a chance to expand on its newcomers - the mercenaries and the scientists.  The flash-forwards seem nifty, but they don't have the finely-tuned structure of the old flashbacks - that is we don't see them elegantly stack together in chronological terms.  Unwittingly, the show proves this when surreptitiously entwining a flash-forward around a flash-back - it's a great device, but it suggests that causation ain't what it used to be (or will be, or...).      What you can't miss:  LOST manages to survive despite flirting with disaster in almost every episode, straddling lines of science-fiction and the supernatural without ever becoming a sci-fi or fantasy show.  More than any other show, LOST manages to have its characters swap ends in terms of being sympathetic - with Jack morphing from heroic to self-righteous and power-hungry, while bad-guy Sawyer becomes a real hero.  Abbreviated plot lines nevertheless set the right degree of tension, keeping us glued until that final shocking scene called \\"wait till next season!\\"    ABSOLUTELY NO EXTRAS OR FEATURETTES WERE HARMED OR VIEWED IN THE MAKING OF THIS REVIEW.
B000AP04L0|3.0|I'm sure if you work in an office this film may be a riot. While I thought it was funny and entertaining, there wasn't much going on in this film. The cast is very good with lots of quirky characters and it is certainly worth seeing, it just doesn't go anyhwere. You might want to check it out on cable before you buy it. This may grow on me with repeat viewings. Until it does, I rate it 3 1/2 stars.
B000YAA68C|1.0|I have not recieved the movie I order, so I can't review it. Please check to when it will be shipped.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I love animated films and Monster Inc. is no exception. It's got great animation, characters and a well thought out story, but it might be a little too intense for the youngest viewers. Classic monster buffs will catch lots of winks and nods to the days of yesteryear in this irresistible and funny film. It might do your young children good to see this with an adult to help them get over 'the monsters in the closet' syndrome most kids have at a young age. The two disc set has a beautiful DVD transfer and lots of extras.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I never received this item.  I am questioning if I should even use Amazon in the future if they have Vendors that do not honor requests.  This has been very difficult for me.  I have waited over 3 weeks with no response from Sho Time.  I am very dissatisfied.
B000068CNX|5.0|I personally like all 10 seasons of this show but there is something about Season 2 that just keeps you wanting to watch friends and re-watch this season. As this show gets into its older seasons there is always something that upsets me in some way. For example, Chandler just starts getting bashed on more and more later on and Monica gets really annoying. Also, Ross and Rachel never get back together ONCE until the end of the show after they break up in the 1st episode in the 4th season except for their little flings and Emma who's born in the 9th season. But even though all the seasons are good there are always some episodes in the other seasons that annoy me. However, the second season is not like this.      Season 2 of the show FRIENDS starts off right where it left off from season 1 and the story line is great. But the jokes and the acting and everything just gets better. This is where the show really starts to take off. It starts off with Rachel at the airport to welcome Ross back but he comes back with a  new girlfriend, Julie, and that starts the Rachel jelousy. Then Ross finds out that Rachel likes him and he realizes in the episode \\"The one where Ross finds out\\" that he needs to be with her. Then after a few bumps in the road they finally are able to get together which is a really great moment for the show. But I think this season is great not just for Ross and Rachel but for the other characters. You realize the closeness that Chandler and Joey have for one another in the episodes that Joey wants to and does move out before he comes back. Also, especially the really funny jokes chandler brings to this season starting from the beginning to the end which got better from Season 1 are good. Joey's character even matures throughout. Then Monica dates Richard and has a serious relationship that gets referred back to in the other seasons. I thought that was a good storyline to put in. Then Pheobe just brings her cool weirdness that plays an interesting part in the whole season. There are really no episodes at all in this season that I don't want to re-watch. They are all very good. Even the couple I maybe would say were on the lower end of the episode list have re-play value.     Here are the episodes in the season. If I had to choose a favorite disc or episode I would probably say Disc Three which I think is really good on top of the other ones.    Disc One    1. \\"The One With Ross' New Girlfriend\\"    2. \\"The One With the Breast Milk\\"    3. \\"The One Where Heckles Dies\\"    4. \\"The one with Phoebe's Husband\\"    5. \\"The one with Five Steaks and an Eggplant\\"    6. \\"The one with the Baby on the Bus\\"    Disc Two    7. \\"The one where Ross find out\\"    8. \\"The one with the List\\"    9. \\"The one with Phoebe's Dad\\"    10. \\"The one with Russ\\"    11. \\"The one with the Lesbian Wedding\\"    12. \\"The one after the Super Bowl\\"    Disc Three    13. \\"The one with the Prom Video\\"    14. \\"The one where Ross and Rachel...You know\\"    15. \\"The one where Joey moves out\\"    16. \\"The one where Eddie Moves in\\"    17. \\"The one where Dr. Romoray Dies\\"    18. \\"The one where Eddie won't Go\\"    Disc Four    19. \\"The one where Old Yeller dies\\"    20. \\"The one with the Bullies\\"    21. \\"The one with Two Parties\\"    22. \\"The one with the Chicken Pox\\"    23. \\"The one with Barry & Mindy's Wedding\\"
B000002UB6|4.0|Let it Be was originally going to be titled Get Back. It was intended to show insight on how the Beatles compiled the album.  The problem was, at the time the Beatles were in the process of breaking up. The tension had started during the White Album and was like a snowball, just getting bigger and bigger.  Paul had intended for the session to get back to their roots and work live.  The final scene is a scene on the roof where Billy Preston joins in while the local police are receiving complaints. Their manager told them that they would be arrested and Paul replies, \\"Let them, it will be a good ending. It certainly would have been controversial to say the least.  The album is unique in the sense that many songs were written previously for other albums and finally used.  One example would be, the one after 909, which was recorder during the very early stages of Beatlemania.  Maxwell's Silver Hammer was written during the White Album. Paul was able to complete it and use it here.  George at the time had just came back from Woodstock were he had been hanging out with Bob Dylan and the Band.  He had also been with Eric Clapton quite a bit.  John was into Yoko and Paul was dating Linda Eastman, who he would marry very soon.  Paul was in the process of trying to keep the group together while John actually was ready to call it a day and was not able to get the nerve to do it yet.  The songs themselves are not the best the Beatles have ever done.  There are some gems on the album though.  Let it Be became a classic. Harrison was writing more and more and contributed, several songs.   If you want to see the break up of the Beatles on film, here it is.  What I find amazing is how they came back later and recorded a masterpiece like Abbey Road. I guess they all knew it was their swan song and wanted to go out on top.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Ya mucho se ha hablado acerca del regreso de Portishead, de su larga ausencia, de su expectativa, así que me limitaré a opinar sobre lo que les escucho. Un exceso de oscuridad (como debe ser), exceso de posproducción (como debe ser), un exceso de miel en la voz (como debe ser) para que cuando te engañe y la pruebes descubras que es hiel (como debe ser), guitarras muy limitadas a lo que deben tocar, ni un rasgueo de más, instrumentos invitados sólo cuando son precisos.   The Rip solita paga la inversión en el album; no se si todavía no le agarro la onda pero la revista R&R dijo que si se tardaron 11 años para componer Machine Gun QUE SE TOME OTROS 11 y hagan otro rolón de ese tamaño (a mi no me impactó tanto); Deep Water con esa tonada y esas voces adicionales es de las que no olvidas al terminar el disco. En resumen y en conjunto, funciona, pero si no conocías el Trip Hop a lo mejor no te entra    Reseña en \\"Yo Soy Aquel...\\"  [...]
B000WTDGD2|5.0|I never write reviews but I was compelled (or possesed ;)<br /><br />My girlfriend brought home the first season loaned to her as a friend so I half heartedly watched the first episode and was only mildly entertained but it caught my attention quickly and now I am hooked!<br /><br />I love this show and agree with many of the other reviews. Supernatural is an excellent program. I admit that some episodes are better than others but overall the acting is strong and the writers are witty.<br />I enjoy the special effects and fast paced action scenes.<br /><br />The overall storyline is consistant and well plotted. It's a long process but the series alows fun breathers in between with the varied sub plots.<br />The show even takes jabs at itself and the industry.<br /><br />I like how the Amazon.com Unbox player works and it's ease of use once you get started.
B000005DQR|5.0|Este es viejito, de 1996, pero se convierte en el mejor disco que tengo de éste género. Tarde en entrarle aunque ya había escuchado los rumores de los 10 dedos prodigios de DJ Shadow, también ya había oido que UNKLE sin él jamás sería igual (y me gusta el UNKLE actual). Es una selección de canciones originales que parece que fueron escritas para él, para ser puestos todos juntos y remezclados para sonar de ésta forma. Temas destacados? Todos! De principio a fin, hasta los sampleos que duran segundos son indispensables, pero si quieren saber, éste disco lo pedí nada mas con escuchar \\"Building steam with a grain of salt\\"  SAMPLEA UN SOLO DE BATERÍA! ¿Si han visto a alguien samplear?

0767020308|5.0|My mom, sister and I all enjoyed this version of Emma very much! I just love the romance it has to it. Other people have said Kate Beckinsale's Emma is annoying/dark/whatever but I thought she was absolutely perfect. The rest of the cast was very well chosen too, especially Mark Strong as Mr. Knightley... there was great chemistry there. My mom thought he looked too young but I don't care. :) Another big reason why I liked this version better than the Gwyneth Paltrow one was that it's more true to the book, both literally and in spirit. The GP version just seemed a little too Hollywood to me, too molded to fit the masses.   Of the three versions of Emma I've seen, this is my favorite! I'd say watch this one first, the GP version second, and don't even bother with the others, unless you're feeling very tolerant.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|Primer buen augurio, está producido por Brian Joseph Burton (a.k.a. Danger Mouse). Segundo buen augurio, el primer sencillo y su respectivo video estaban buenísimos. Tercer buen augurio, la crítica especializada dice que este duo pasa por su mejor momento. Cuarto augurio, como ya lo había posteado, todas los conciertos que tienen LLENO TOTAL desde semanas antes.  Como lo hacen? Puede parecer sencillo: grabando mi segundo mejor disco del año The Black Keys se apoyan en las bases del blues (si son las 5 teclas negras del piano) y del rock para crear temas tan conscisos como So he won't break, tan agresivos como I got mine, y tan maduras como Things ain't like they used to be aunque Fabian se queda de que está montada sobre la música de Don't let me down. El disco no puede abrir de mejor manera \\"Ain't it just like dying, except you can still feel the shame\\"
B000W4D94I|5.0|Looks good to me on Blu-Ray. I don't see any grain like someone said before.
B0017I1FNK|3.0|I have been a long time fan of Emmylou Harris, and similar singer-songwriters. Emmylou always had the melancholy end of the market sewed up tight -- although I don't know much about her personal history, I understand that she's had some setbacks in her life. So have we all. While the singing, playing and writing are competent on this one, these songs are pretty much all in the same vein -- 'life has passed me by, I'm gonna die'. Unlike her earlier albums, the theme here is consistently depressive.    I'm not averse to sad songs, but enough already. We all make bad choices, we're all going to experience pain and disaster and we're all bound for the boneyard, but it's not wrong to have a laugh or three along the way. I'm sure that this CD comes from deep down in her artistic soul, but I wish she'd fight the sadness harder. There is a lighter side to life.    There are many fine country/folk/bluegrass artists out there who have experienced loss and sadness, but manage to mix it up more, for example, Lynn Morris (Lynn Morris Band). Her \\"You'll Never Be The Sun\\" has been recorded by Emmy Lou, Dolly Parton and a bunch of others, but not better.    Sad and happy are two sides of the same coin.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|The only thing I'll say about this album is that it is absolutely phenomenal. Slipknot really took a step above and beyond their previous two releases, and in the process managed to alienate themselves from much of the core fanbase, which is just fine by me. If you can't understand that bands need to mature in order to stay relevant, then turn your backs and walk away - they obviously don't need your money or your criticism anyway. For those of you who claim that the band \\"went soft\\" or \\"sold out\\" just because they chose not to write 13 heavy and brutal songs, you're all very wrong; the songs on this album all have a heaviness to them, even the acoustic ones like \\"Vermilion pt. 2\\", it's just not the same type of extroverted, obvious heaviness. Every song on the album is dark, and Corey continues to provide his fans with poetic lyrics; I especially like that he decided to be more philosophical in his lyrical approach this time around, focusing on psuedo-political themes and on what's wrong with the world as a whole rather than the things that are wrong in his life (as with \\"Slipknot\\" and \\"Iowa\\"). I give this album 5/5 stars, it is a masterpiece, and every time I listen to it, it gets better.    Now, my intention of writing this review is also to confront the haters of this band. I have absolutely no problem with people who don't like Slipknot's music; hey, it's your choice what to listen to. But what is the point of coming on here and saying that this band isn't \\"real\\" metal, other than to satisfy some childish need to be anonymously heard through inane criticism? I am a diehard metalhead and I am 27 years old; I listen to all different types of bands from the various subgenres. Just to shut you up before you even start with the ridiculous rantings claiming that I am some type of \\"poser\\", here are some of my favorite and most respected bands: Slayer (probably my favorite all time metal band), Metallica (only the first four albums, though), Exodus, Testament, Megadeth, Obituary, Napalm Death, Opeth, Meshuggah, Brujeria, Sepultura, Fear Factory, The Haunted, Soilwork (early stuff), Cannibal Corpse, Death, Cattle Decapitation, Dying Fetus, Goatwhore, and Strapping Young Lad just to name a handful. Obviously, the Slipknot critics will point to most or all of the aforementioned bands and say \\"THAT'S real metal.\\" Well, it's great if you think so, but what in the world designates \\"real\\" metal from \\"fake\\" metal? Many of you claim it's the drop chords on the guitar; that any band who drops chords is fake metal. What kind of absurd reasoning is that? And who made you the all knowing, all judging authority on this matter? Other people say it's because there are no solos in Slipknot's music. Well, BIG DEAL! Guitar solos are only relevant today because a small number of modern bands brought back the classic sounds of early 1980s thrash metal - ala early Metallica, Exodus, Megadeth, Slayer, etc. and suddenly we now hear guitar solos all over the place, which results in mindless reproduction and writing solos just for the sake of writing solos (as if we need more passionless crap written without any true emotion). If every single metal band out there played solos, the genre/subgenres would be entirely boring. Bands who use the drop chords give some variety to the metal community. Sure, it might not necessarily be as technically difficult to drop a chord and play a catchy tune as it is to write a complex solo, but who - aside from you judgmental turds - really cares that much? If the music sounds good, it sounds good, end of story. And, when did complexity necessarily mean well structured and well written? I've heard plenty of garbage out there that is complex as can be, but not worth even one listen. When we place all of the emphasis on complexity and guitar soloing, we begin to sacrifice the most important aspect of ANY type of music: the emotion. Music is art, it is about personal expression; when it becomes about 'who can write the sickest, fastest guitar solo' or 'who can write the most complex song structure', the music tends to become empty and mechanical, like a machine that rivals (and even transcends) human beings in every single way except for one, the ability to express true emotion. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I don't appreciate technicality, complexity, and soloing - a lot of bands do it with immense emotion. But too many bands overdue it with that stuff nowadays.    And, as a last point of argument, never forget that your opinion is just that; an opinion and not fact. You can love Slipknot, you can hate Slipknot. But don't sit there by your computer and claim to know what is and is not \\"real\\" metal. Like it or not, this band is here to stay, and like it or not, this band has sold more records and will continue to sell more records than most of these \\"technically complex, solo playing\\" bands out there today. Oh, and also don't forget that listening to music is a subjective experience, so neither your words nor mine will change people's opinions on what is and is not good. Thank you for your time.
1593072937|4.0|I come from the point of view of viewing the film first, then reading the series.  From this point of view I have seen the bits and pieces that were left out of the film, and it saddens me.  There's so much great material that Rodriguez his team left out of the film.  Theres so much more to Marv, but I guess everything can't be adapted.  I would have wished to see Frank Miller's Sin City in theaters word for word, but they couldn't make that happen for me and I understand.  That's what brings us to the novels anyway. To see what we've been missing.<br /><br />The dialogue and illustrations are just as captivating as the film.  Some of the drawings were a little tough to comprehend but after some squinting it became easy.  Other than that little note, however, the novel is a true work of art.  Marv is such an original character, that no comic fan could pass on.  If you've seen the film and want more of the big-headed psycho, then pick up this book and take off.  It's got a lot of neat stuff that the film didn't offer.
B00154GEFU|4.0|I was very impressed with this, considering how bad things became when Howe left the first time in 1984.    1990's best of CD collection \\"Then and Now\\", which had still had Carl Palmer in the band, was at least listenable.  But now that Steve Howe is back, the magic has returned.  I was sceptical, but the album stands up to repeated listening, if you're a fan of melody, powerful singing, and interesting guitar licks.  Palmer's drumming is a little pedestrian on this outing though.    BTW, I just saw them Live in April 2008 at the House of Blues in Dallas and it was great!  The tour merchandise has USB wristbands with live recording's of that night's at [...] for $35.  Believe it or not, it was a great investment.  They suprised everyone by digging way back into the back catalogue of former groups all the band members were in, including the Buggles, which ended up being quite a humorous show stopper.    I bought the import version of this CD which comes with a band interview, for those interested in that kind of thing.  Haven't watched it yet though as the album's been playing in my truck for the last several weeks.
0895292211|5.0|The customer who wrote that critique panned the book, citing that it primarily was out of date and did not give good scientific evidence. However, this book is NOT Dr. Howell's \\"scientific\\" book. In the mid-40s he published a book filled with many hundreds of citations supporting his conclusions. THIS book is a popularization of his conclusions. I have read both, and can definitely say that this book is entertaining, enlightening, and still revolutionary in its implications for proper human nutrition.    The reviewer also objected to the idea that the pancreas has a finite capacity for enzyme production. Dr. Howell notes that the heart also has a finite capacity for beating cycles. This fact is generally accepted in the life sciences, so why the idea that the pancreas is similarly limited is so hard for that reviewer to accept is unclear.    I have seen nothing to disprove or discount Dr. Howell's conclusions. Indeed, I have been using his principles of enzyme supplementation in my own diet for over 16 years, and I can personally attest that he is RIGHT because one's body does indeed process food differently when there are plenty of enzymes available.

0385474547|1.0|When I taught English 9 Honors, I would ask my students what they thought of the books we read.  _Things Fall Apart_ always won the \\"worst book\\" award.  They were right.  This is one of the most overrated novels of the English language.      If Achebe had a B.S. detector, he might have been able to chisel this text down to an almost-bearable short story.  Alas, he didn't, and this is what we have.     Okonkwo, the protagonist, is supposed to be tragic, but he's not.  He's pathetic.  He's utterly revolting, from beginning to end.  The other characters aren't much better.    The plot starts nowhere and ends in the same place.  Sure, there's an obvious structure to the novel, but it doesn't matter.  Not much happens.  The characters are lifeless, the plot is lifeless, and the prose is lifeless.  I know, Achebe crafted the prose to be what it is-- but that doesn't make it any good.      It amazes me that this book is placed alongside (or above, if you listen to some people) works such as _Moby Dick_, _The Great Gatsby_, _Ulysses_, _The Sun Also Rises_, and _The Sound and the Fury_.  The truth is, last month's issue of _Bop_ has more value than _Things Fall Apart_.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I LOVE this show, the writing and acting is edgy, fun, poignant, a full range of emotions.  Season one for me was rocky the first time around, was much better the second time I watched it, even then I saw improvement with each episode.  Season two shows what the show could be, and now with season three they have hit their stride!  You will not be disappointed with any season of this show.
B000002GB2|5.0|Styx's 'Equinox' is one of their most progressive oriented records. Their last record with original guitarist John Curulewski, who left later in 1975, and would be replaced by Tommy Shaw, who would make his debut with the band on 1976's 'Crystal Ball' album.    But boy is 'Equinox' good! Every song on here is worth 5 stars. Dennis DeYoung sings on most songs, but also take note of James Young's vocal appearance on 'Midnight Ride' and Curulewski's on 'Mother Dear.'     My favorite song on the album is probably 'Mother Dear.' It features some awesome slide guitar and some awesome keyboards from Dennis. John's vocals are surprisingly good; he could have easily sang lead for another band.    'Lorelei,' obviously, was the hit on the record. It is a superb song, and probably my second favorite on the album. Dennis' vocals are at their very best, and this song is definitely worth listening to.    'Suite Madame Blue,' 'Prelude 12,' 'Midnight Ride' and 'Light Up' are the other highlights here. And that's pretty much the whole record. Everything on this record is great.     Overall, 1975's 'Equinox' is one of Styx's best. Highly recommended for any Styx fan. This record is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!
B000XGDO04|5.0|I don't know why she is compared to Amy Winehouse.  I love Amy but Adele's style and voice are quite different.      This is a top notch artist, one of the first I have been excited about in years.  You can't go wrong with her.  Don't expect Amy and you will not be disappointed.  Strong voice, wonderful lyrics.  This woman will go places.  She is head and shoulders above most other female vocalists recording now.      Buy this!  You'll love it.  Really!

B000NA2BEU|5.0|Veronica Mars.  Short.  Blonde.  Petite. Sassy.  Detective?  A young incapable looking girl is a tough, action figure private detective in a town full of sin.<br /><br />In the show's third season it adopted a new format.  Instead of the season long mystery it had three mysteries that played out one after the other along with each episodes 'mini-mystery'.<br /><br />The season starts out with Logan and Veronica finally together, letting the audience see what they really are like as a couple.  Giving a good majority of the fans (self proclaimed LoVe shippers) exactly what they wanted: their favorite diminutive detective together with their favorite abused bad boy.  The relationship, as always, is rocky and doesn't last.  Logan is depicted as the ever accomadating boyfriend, only wanting to please his oblivious girlfriend.  Veronica starts off in the good girlfriend role, attentive to a point and loving to a point, but eventually succumbs to her fear of commitment (something that seems to only happen when she's with Logan) and her inability to fully trust him (even though he saved her life and risked his own only a few short months earlier on the roof of the hotel he calls home).  The relationship ends but is briefly revisited before Veronica learns that Logan has slept with her arch-nemesis: Madison Sinclair.  She ends it this time and adds that she'll never forgive him.<br /><br />The first mystery is the 'Hearst Rapist' story arch, which was introduced in the second season with the reappearance of Troy Vandergraff (the drug dealer Veronica briefly dated in season one).  The Rapist terrorizes campus, and Mac's roommate (and Veronica's new friend) falls victim to him.  The rapists' attack on the women of campus remind Veronica of her own rape and spurs her into action, along with getting vengeance for new friend Parker.  The rapist goes after her and is basically the cause of Logan's breaking up with her (other than the fact that she completely pulls away).  She catches the rapist and is nearly raped herself in the process.  Sadly it turns out to be another associate of Logan's, making me wonder exactly why the writers want him surrounded by the dreges of humanity.<br /><br />The second mystery is the murder of the dean, which is introduced in the same episode as the first mystery is concluded.  During this mystery, Veronica loses her new mentor, her crimenology professor, when he is accused of the murder due to the fact that he was having an affair with the dean's wife.  The reveal is shocking and comes after the framing of another character.  Also, Veronica's father, Keith, is reinstated as temporary sheriff after Sheriff Lamb is killed in action.<br /><br />The third mystery arch, well, there wasn't really a mystery that spanned the final episodes of the season/series.  It was filled with mini-mysteries and romantic entanglements as Logan starts dating Parker and Veronica begins dating Wallace's roommate, Piz (yeah, that's the name they gave him).<br /><br />It comes full circle in the last episode with Jake Kane and Clarence Weidman return.  And you see huge oil painting portraits of both Lilly and Duncan Kane.<br /><br />I loved this season as well as the first two and wish that it hadn't been cancelled.  There was so much more they could have done with it.  It reminded me of my previous favorite show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and surpassed it in it's three short seasons.  Sadly the ratings weren't there, most likely because it was pitted against American Idol for most of its run.  Some argue that the monstrosity that they aired during VM's hiatus, The Pussy Cat Dolls, did better in the ratings in the time slot, but that also coincided with the American Idol hiatus too.  Sadly it was not enough to save a show that many people loved.<br /><br />There is, however, talk of a Veronica Mars Movie.arly raped herself in the process.

Sadly it was not enough to save a show that many people loved.    There is, however, talk of a Veronica Mars Movie.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|First of all, I am sick of people giving this album 1 star, it is way better than that! Madonna has created such a gem, because it has influence from most of the albums she has created in the past!!! Here is a breakdown of each song and what I think about each:    Candyshop 9/10: This song is very fun!! It is sassy and starts off the album well! Reminds me of the Erotica era, because she says whatever she wants and doesn't care what anyone thinks! Don't take the song too literally, it's supposed to be a teaser for the rest of the album.    4 Minutes 11/10: This was the perfect single to release to get her back on American radio. Great beat and the horns are so catchy!!    Give it 2 Me 20/10: This to me is her best song since Music because it can be a big hit in the U.S. and the rest of the world!! The instrumentation reminds me of \\"Everybody\\"+\\"Music,\\" and you can't go wrong with that!!    Heartbeat 12/10: This song is \\"Lucky Star\\" 2008 style!!! The synths are great and the beat is infectious!! Any old school Madonna fan cannot deny the fun lyrics and awesome beat of this song.    Miles Away 15/10: If you mix together Frozen and Love Profusion, then you come up with this gem!! One of the best lyrical songs on the album, and it showcases Madonna's vocals in a great way! This song would definitely be a big hit, and it already is in Japan!!    She's not Me 10/10: Madonna has created an anthem about being better than her signicant other's lover!! It is so 70s disco/funk, which I still cannot believe how well Madonna pulled off this sound!! At the end it gets all COADF (Hung Up style) which is awesome!!     Incredible 8/10: This song is different but in a pretty good way! It is creative and has many different styles(rock,pop,r&b,etc.) I really like it, but I can see a few people having a problem with it!! But listen to it a couple of times before you write it off completely! Think \\"Cherish\\" just 2008 style!!    The Beat Goes On 17/10: This is my second fav song off the album!! It is way better than the original one!! It reminds me of Bedtime Stories meets the first Madonna album!! Great funkiness and bells, and Kanye makes a great appearance, without taking over the song!    Dance 2night 14/10: I ranked this song high because it is such a great laid back groove!! Madonna has been making a lot of fast-pased dance songs,(which are awsome of course!) but it's great to see her make something so groovy that you can groove to! This is a great funk song, and I love Madonna's vocals!    Spanish Lesson 7/10: This is the only song in the bunch that I think should have been reworked on!! It has great potential and a great beat! After many listens it is a good song!! After a while, you will start to like it.    Devil Wouldn't Recognize You 11/10: This is so \\"Ray of Lightish\\" but with a more urban influence!! I love her vocals!!!! Another song with deep lyrics, and possible great single if she decides to release it!!    Voices 10/10: To all the fans who enjoy Madonna's \\"mystical side,\\" this ones for you!!! Best lyrics on the whole album and awesome vocals.  This Ray of Light meets the Music album!! Great way to end an album.    All in all, one of her best albums ever because she had so many influences from the past, and the album actually turned out amazing!!!! To me, this is a hard thing to accomplish, to have every song be different yet awesome at the same time.  A must have for fans, and it will create more fans for Madonna!!!
B000001F5F|5.0|U2's 'Under A Blood Red Sky' is a superb live record from U2. It's one of the best live records of the '80s in my opinion. The eight songs here are all essential for any U2 fan. This is a must-own for any U2 lover.    But, I do have a few things to say for the U2 collector.    -First, not all of the songs here were recorded at Red Rocks, making this more of a live album than a soundtrack to a film. These were all taken during three stops on the 'War' tour. Only two were recorded at Red Rocks, and those were 'Gloria' and 'Party Girl.' 'I Will Follow,' 'Electric Co.,' 'New Year's Day,' 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and '40' were all recorded in Germany, and '11 O' Clock Tick Tock' was recorded in Boston. All were recorded in 1983.    -The second is more of a note to collectors than casual fans. 'The Electric Co.' has a snippit chopped off. Bono sings 'Send In The Clowns' in the middle of the song, and because of copyright issues, Island was forced to remove the song from the CD release. This won't bother casual U2 fans, but for die-hards like me, it is a tad annoying.    If you collect bootlegs like I do, you probably have the whole Red Rocks show and the full version of 'Electric Co.' that was featured on the vinyl.    But still, despite that one flaw about the edited version of 'The Electric Co.,' this is a superb live album. One of the best from U2.    Highly recommended. A must-listen live album. ENJOY!!!
B000Y7U98W|4.0|I finally had an opportunity to watch this film, and as a sci-fi action fan, I was pleasantly surprised! Unfortunately I missed this one in the theaters, but I would love to see this film on the big screen. Some of the visuals are  simply amazing, and the predicament that this crew was in, left me in true awe. This is a departure from the usual hollywood formula, and the philosophical implications of being on a mission to restart earth while encountering true personal and ethical disaster is stunning. Definitely worth a look, if you can tolerate levels higher than the run of the mill sci-fi thriller. A true treat!
6305971935|3.0|I had seen this show years ago and remembered it as being better than it is.   A good story brought to film by mediocre screenwriters, a mediocre director, and mediocre actors. Above all, the direction suffered the most.   Not a bad movie or loss of time spent, just not as good as it could have been. Glad it wasn't too expensive.
0385340567|3.0|I have read every one of Lee Child's books and enjoyed them all. Even this one. But I must admit that the quality has deteroriated. Another author who appears to be slowly losing it...    Still the formula of an Englishman writing gripping American thrillers with British spelling and British humor is quite appealing. Long may it last... Fortunately, other authers such as George Robertson are continuing this tradition first established by the one and only Lee Child.
B000YDOOU0|4.0|Pat Metheny convened another well-regarded trio in Christian McBride and Antonio Sanchez for touring and two CD's.  This is the first one, \\"Tokyo Day Trip Live EP\\" is an addendum of sorts.  This CD starts off mild-mannered (it's overall fairly mild-mannered), but that doesn't mean there isn't great playing or improvisation.  \\"Let's Move\\" takes Pat's lyrical guitar playing to a faster tempo.  \\"Is This America?\\" is a soft acoustic guitar song.  I like it, though since it's a tribute to New Orleans I hoped it would be better.  \\"When We Were Free\\" has a catchy melody, and Pat uses a more overdriven guitar tone and then his guitar synth - it's one of the better songs.  \\"Dreaming Trees\\", like most songs with \\"dreaming\\" in the title, is a nice acoustic song.  \\"The Red One\\" is familiar from the Metheny-Scofield album \\"I Can See Your House From Here\\".  Pat's one-guitar version is entirely credible, the mark of a well-written song.  \\"Day Trip\\" ends the CD with a bunch of very good, and happy, notes.  I think any Pat Metheny fans would like, and any fans of mainstream jazz guitar.  There are some people (like me) who aren't fans of the \\"marshmallow Pat\\" but like the \\"serious jazz Pat\\".  If you're in that category, you'll like this one.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I bought this set when it first came out. It was on sale lately and I bought again. Someday I'll open one of them.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|This is an excellent box set.  The pictures, the booklet, the dvd, and b side cd and of course the Joshua Three album makes for an excellent package.  I love U2!  I recommend this to anyone who loves U2!
B000065BPB|2.0|They sounded great, but they were way too tight (and I have a small head). They gave me a headache after less then an hour of wearing them.  I returned them and bought a pair of AKG K240s.  The AKG's are much more comfortable, but I'd say the Sennheisers may have sounded just tad better, though it's had to say for sure since I couldn't listen side-by-side.
B00139W3NE|1.0|The movie is faithful to the book- In this movie, as in the first book, there is no talk of killing god but it is coming in the second book! The movie is prettily made. My only concern for children, is the possible sequel. The series IS about killing god, it is actually explicitly stated in the books- those who deny it are staring at white and calling it black. You do not have to be a religious zealot to see it you just need half a brain. The anti religion whiff is already in this one, but very mild. If you yourself hate god this is definitely a series for you. If you don't, you can still enjoy the special effects. As long as you are a thinking adult, aware of the antireligious undercurrents and the God hating agenda (which Pullman admits freely) you can definitely use this movie to promote thinking. For young unsophisticated children who are yet incapable of multidimensional thought, the book is cunning brainwashing; this movie is just a little dip.
1402210086|5.0|If you loved Friday's Child (my very favorite Heyer book) you'll love Cotillion.<br /><br />Most Heyer books feature heros who need to grow.  In Cotillion, a classic comedy of manners, our innocent heroine (madly in love with a romantic, dashing figure as the book begins) learns to appreciate the real worth of a very average man.<br /><br />Sweet, gentle humor-- a book that gets better with every read.
B0015519VS|5.0|When I first heared and saw the the video for \\"Love In This Club\\". The only thing I liked about the song was that it didn't have a typical sound. And as far as the video goes the only thing that held my interest there was When, the ladies somehow wrap themselfs around there gentleman's necks to whom they are dancing with.\\"This Ain't Sex\\" is one of my many favorite songs on the album because it's great club record. Now, for the song \\"Trading places\\" I simply enjoy the idea of the roll rversal of that song. The track talks about we as ladies taking gentlemen out to dinner, going on a shopping spree,and we ladies being on top an gentlemen being on the bottom when we make love.     I didn't quit get the message behind the song \\"Moving Mountains\\" until Mr.Rayond explained it. And I understand the song internally but, I couldn't explain it to you in words. What I like about the track \\"What's Your Name\\" feat. WILL.I.Am is that it has this outter space feel to it. The sound is not new but,it's fresh. For the interlude to his son it is the sweetest message I have ever heared giving from a father to a son. You will appreciate the track \\"Something Special\\" for those of you Who are in the love bird stage of your relationship.\\"Love You Gently\\" is an tribute to old fashion love making.\\"Best Thing\\" feating Mr.Carter is about looking back on that relationship and realizing your mistakes and growing from those mistakes and I guess if you had a second chance What would you have changed now, that you know differently. I like the track \\"Before I Met You\\" because he is being honest about his pass.    Without a doubt \\"His Mistakes\\" is my absolute favorite ballad on the album because,it talks about How some of we ladies make the current man in our lives pay for previous pain done to us by our pass relationships. \\"Appetite\\" is about a man being tempted to go back to his old ways even though he has the wife and all he's ever wanted. \\" What's A Man To Do\\" is about having true love vs lust.The song \\"Lifetime\\" is about for me at least, finding that special someone that you know without question is the one but,along the way you had people in your life for reason and a season.
B00005MP58|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said better by others.  This rendition is faithful to the book and holds one's interest throughout.  I enjoyed Ms. Knightly's version when I saw it but this one is superior.    I've noticed a tendency lately to superimpose modern mores on these old stories--for instance kissing in public, where a couple appears to be fighting for sole possession of the same wad of gum.  This is probably done to try to improve interest--and therefore marketability--to a young adult audience.  But it would have been unheard of to display that much passion in public in that society and during that period.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Don't miss the talent of Joe Bonamassa! This concert is the best! Just like being there for an outstanding performance from an outstanding performer!!! Absolutely my favorite in my concert library!
B000W4KT64|3.0|Let me first say that though other's have not liked Travolta's turn as Edna Turnblad, I thought he was the highlight of the movie.  It was brave of Travolta, considering all the gay rumors about him.  As for the rest of the movie, I was sorta bored, I thought the score was not very good, the songs are for the most part..bad.  The choreography was first rate, how unfortunite the songs don't do the dances justice.  The girl that plays Tracy is fine, she looks the part, all chubby and height challenged, with a bit of rhythm.  The story is uplifting, I suppose, it's all P.C. and the ending is predictable..really I recommend it for one reason and one reason only: the singular Travolta...enjoy.  FYI, rent dont buy.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This old film is well done and offers an interesting look inside the walls of a Roman Catholic cloister in Belgium, and then at the missionary field of Africa.  But it also provides the same message as the Bible's Old Testament, that strict obedience to an exacting set of rules and regulations is impossible.  One ends up doing as is implied in this film--they either cheat or they leave.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|The animation in this film is incredible, it's so vivid, especially in hi-def.  The film's story is cute and uplifting, without being totally predictable.  Remy is fine protagonist, he is likeable, albeit not exactly cuddly, but you root for him the entire way.  I really didnt like the boy that play's his human friend, if you can call him that.  I was surprised at how much I dislike him and even at the end, I was not pleased to see things had turned out well for him, odd for a movie of this kind.  One odd thing, that really bothered me was how very few of these supposed \\"French\\" characters, bothered with actually having French accents.  The hero is a French rat, with a sort of generic American accent, it seemed so bizarre.  Overall, a very good movie with fantastic animation, not as good as the perfect, Incredible's, but close.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|Not surprisingly, this film feels and unfolds similarly to its cinematic sibling, High Fidelity. Based on John Cusack and Jack Black's outstanding and often hilarious performances in that film, I'd have to say it solidly scores a 5 star rating, and About a Boy, while good, is more of a 4 1/2. About a Boy drags a little at times, isn't quite as overtly humorous, occasionally seems muddled and unsure of its direction or ultimate destination, and leaves poor Toni Colette's character hanging while wrapping things up nicely for everyone else.    Faults aside, About a Boy is refreshingly quirky, honest, and life affirming. Hugh Grant is utterly believable as Will, an aging slacker with a trust fund and uber-cool pad but no friends or fun or reason to get out of bed in the morning. He decides to try to pose as a single dad in order to date single moms in a self-help group, and somehow falls into a cross-generational friendship with an outwardly nerdy but inwardly awesome pre-teen named Marcus. Of course eventually Hugh meets a cute lass and after predictable misunderstandings they finally get together, but in the meantime, the relationship with Marcus and the insight into Marcus's world and the battles he's fighting really lend weight to what could otherwise be a tasteless, rehashed Notting Hill.    Although the movie's end doesn't quite leave you punching the air and yelling \\"Yes! Ten stars!\\" it's still well worth the time, and it's complex and layered enough to be worth later re-watching (which is more than you can say for 99% of the movies out there, right?!).    All in all, a funky little gem of a movie that nicely marries Hollywood happy endings with credible characters, plot, and dialogue and a nifty, soulful, Britpoppy soundtrack. 4 1/2 thumbs up!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Real life bio of Beatrix Potter; I have watched over and over.  Renee does a superb job in the lead role.  Love the scenery, truly beautiful!!
0316143472|5.0|As with all of his other books, this one is also laugh- out- loud hilarious ....which is not to say not also awfully poignant in parts. Thoroughly enjoyable.

0140434089|5.0|I have to admit that until I did a mystery search, I hadn't even heard of Wilkie Collins. Wilkie Collins name came up, along with a description of The Moonstone as being \\"the best of modern English detective novels\\" (as quoted by T.S.Eliot). Big words, indeed. With those lofty expectations, I read The Moonstone, and have to say that this mystery definitely delivered. It lived up to those words.          One of the finer aspects of Collins work is his creation of mood and suspense in the story. There is a feeling of expectation and suspense from the beginning, when the moonstone is stolen, to the case of trying to find out who stole it, to the unmasking of events, people and circumstances at the end. There is a marvelous ability to create narrative point of view from the many narratives told from the various characters. And there are many--eleven different narratives--in total. From Gabriel Betteredge to Franklin Blake to Sergeant Cuff to Miss Clack and other minor characters, Collins is able to change narrative persona and \\"become\\" that person. There is a good deal of intrigue from so many voices, because, quite frankly, you do not know if you can take what the person is saying at face value. In this way, the human element of perspective is amazingly effective in telling this mystery.          There are other elements that make this a worthy mystery. Namely, you have a diverse number of characters, who have their various motives. Throw in a love affair, a tragic character, and an exotic jewel with a curse put on it, and you have quite a remarkable suspense. I have to say that I was hooked.          As far as my own personal interests, I found Sergeant Cuff to be my favorite character. Surely, he's no Sherlock Holmes, but there is a way he goes about trying to solve the mystery that I found refreshing. He's no average sleuth. One of my favorite scenes was the \\"experiment\\" performed by Ezra Jennings in relation to the events leading up to the disappearance of themoonstone.          There is also a little comic relief thrown in from time to time in the person of Gabriel Betteredge, who believes that life's answers and secret are all contained in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe.          The Moonstone is an engaging work, highly detailed, and maybe a little implausible, but Collin's overcomes this. I'm glad I found this one, and I've also heard good things about The Woman in White, another Collins mystery. Definitely worth a read!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Fantastic adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's \\"North and South\\".  Superb production values everything (casting, music, cinematography, direction, locations, editing etc. etc. etc.) is perfect.  The acting is incredible with solid topnotch performances by all.  Noteworthy are the leads especially Richard Armitage who embodied John Thornton.  This man can act!  I agree that \\"He really does manage to convey his character's thoughts and feelings without saying a word\\".  The body language, those expressive eyes (WOW!!!).  Many powerful scenes that are unforgettable:       1. Margaret's entry into the Carding Room of the Mill.       2. Thornton's \\"Look back at me\\".       3. Margaret's \\"I think I've seen hell, It's white, snow white\\"              as Thornton's silhouette glides through the \\"fluff\\".       4. Glimpses of young children working in the mill.       5. The Kiss - In my opinion the best romantic scene on film, so           tender yet so passionate.  My recommendation: Buy the movie to watch over and over again.  It is that good!!
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|My husband and I went to see this in the theaters and couldn't wait to get the DVD when it came out. This movie turns a normally sad event-- a funeral-- into a comedy that makes you laugh so hard your stomach hurts. We both had tears rolling down our cheeks.     The whole movie is about one man's funeral and how his family handles the stresses that pop up during such a terrible event. One thing after another goes wrong... and it's hysterical!
B000002HEM|5.0|i remember seeing this when it first came out .the  MTV unplugged series was definitely an armature  show till natalie and the maniacs appeared and i never even heard of them  the track- because the night became an instant hit you can still hear it on radios stations almost daily (my other favorite was -like the weather )all the tracks were great and the band and natalie were on point this show put the unplugged series on the map and set the standards high it was also visually pleasing to watch but they didnt put it on DVD my other favorite was the nirvana episode no DVD either
B000W4KT6E|4.0|***1/2 2007. Directed by Adam Shankman. Three Golden Globe nominations. Remake of John Waters's 1988 [[ASIN:B00006RZ9Y Hairspray]]. Baltimore in the early 60's. A fat teenager dreams of becoming a dancer in a local TV show. If one may wonder whether it was really necessary, if one excepts the financiary reason of course, to present another adaptation of John Waters's outstanding script, this 2007 version is nonetheless an excellent film for the family. Recommended.
B00164DWEA|4.0|It seems Marvel has done a wise thing in producing the movies based on their beloved comic book characters.  With \\"Iron Man\\" a huge hit and quickly approaching the 300 million dollar mark domestically, they've proved they can give their superheroes the treatment they deserve.  Now, they've rebooted the Hulk franchise with a convincing if not entirely complete success.<br /><br />  Almost everyone who saw the first film a few years ago are bound to compare the two.  While the first movie was not as bad as many thought, it just lacked the action and true spirit that this film supplies.  With the origin story out of the way, this second film can focus on Bruce Banner and his fight with the green demon inside him.  Also, we are treated to the action in a quicker manner and the story moves along with a better flow than its predecessor.<br /><br />  This time around, the General, Betty's father (played well by William Hurt in this film) is determined to capture Banner to create the perfect weapon, superhuman soldiers who would be nearly invincible. With the help of an overzealous and blood-thirty marine (played wickedly by Tim Roth), the duo stalk Banner at every turn until he must return home to the US and try again to cure his powerful alter-ego.  Once home, Banner (Ed Norton in a performance that is quietly reminiscent of Bill Bixby) looks for the woman he loves, Betty Ross.  On the run with Betty, Bruce is desperate to find a way to exterminate the hulk, no matter the cost.  Unfortunately, the creation of the evil Abomination, proves to be a reason to keep the green giant alive...for now.<br /><br />  The director of \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" gives fans of the comic character what they truly want---action.  Ang Lee, a superb director, misfired with his film adaptation but this version will appease most fans.  Norton and Tyler as Bruce and Betty have good chemistry and Roth makes a chillingly evil villain.  My one complaint (and its really a small one) is that I hope in the future they will continue to work on the CGI hulk.  He wasn't bad but I think they can continue to improve the visuals to make him look more realistic in time.  The final fight sequence was great and the cameos of Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno (as well as a nod to Bill Bixby at the beginning of the film) are nice touches.  And the final cameo, Robert Downey Jr, as Tony Stark was a great way to end the film (as well as setting up the inevitable Avengers movie)!<br /><br />  Recommended for all those who enjoyed the Hulk comics, for fans of action films and for anyone who enjoys a good summer popcorn movie!  I look forward to adding this one to my dvd collection!they will continue to work on the CGI hulk.

B001608QVS|5.0|If you're a fan of the Dirty Harry films, and you have a Blu-Ray player, this is a no-brainer.  A lot of Blu-Ray transfers are disappointing, particularly in older films.  However, Warner has pulled out all the stops, and every one of these films, even the oldest, looks and sounds utterly spectacular.<br /><br />The original DIRTY HARRY features a lot of aerial photography of San Francisco, as some of the earlier action takes place on rooftops.  The detail in these distance shots is staggeringly clear.  The colors are rich, vivid, and bold, and the remixed soundtrack is shatteringly good for a film of this vintage.<br /><br />The four sequels look equally good (the fifth, THE DEAD POOL, suffers only because it was not shot in true widescreen ) and all films are supplemented with a wide selection of new extras.  The box even includes a personal message from Clint Eastwood, encouraging you to sample the new bonus features.<br /><br />I watched all five films in less than a week and I'm ready to watch them all again.  It's about time older films started receiving this kind of treatment in High-Def; hopefully this is a harbinger of things to come for classics films of the 60s, 70s, and 80s.  Go ahead, make your day and buy this box.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Though I am not a huge fan of zombie movies, it is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. Brilliant writing, timing and attention to details make this movie hysterical. Watch it repeatedly, and find jokes that may have came too fast or that are hiding in the background. Not only funny, but a brilliant commentary on how life can slip away from us if we don't make the most of it, as we become \\"zombies\\" in our day to day lives. Both hysterically funny and deeply symbolic, if it doesnt make you laugh and better appreciate your life, something is wrong with you.
B0007G89G4|5.0|STAND BY ME is an amazing film that totally captures small town life, the late 1950's and more universally what it's like to be at that in between age of 12 or 13.  It is incredible how much we learn about the four friends - Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern - in a relatively short amount of time.  This can be credited to the performances of the young actors (all are excellent but River Phoenix really shines) guided by the expert direction of Rob Reiner and maybe most importantly the heartfelt source material, the novella THE BODY by Stephen King which is one of his best efforts outside of the pure horror genre.    One of the things that impressed me most about the film is the kids talk, act and think like real kids of that age still do today and probably always will.  It's a shame the film is rated R because of its rough but realistic language since a lot of kids in the 12 - 16 years old age bracket could readily identify with the characters and the themes though granted this is certainly no kiddie movie for the under twelve set.   But for anyone who has graduated from sixth grade or so this is a wonderful movie that shouldn't be missed.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|The photography was the only good thing in this movie. The dialog was very dry and tedious. I kept thinking it would pick up as it went along. It didn't. Very boring story and 158 minutes is too much for a boring movie. Might be good to fall asleep to if you have insomnia. Obviously some people found something interesting about this movie. Not me. I pass on this one.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I really loved this film... I love that it's not just about being gay, but about finding yourself and taking chances. That relationships are not just about sex but about sharing and discovering.  I think the story is great and Trevor Wright does an excellent job. I wish it could have been longer but well... really check this one out, you won't be disappointed.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Elbow is a band I've grown to love over the years, and after enjoying their Leaders of the Free World album, I was very impressed with The Seldom Seen Kid.  Realizing that not every song will jam, and not every song will pluck the right heart string for that mood, I listened to each song at different times, in different moods, and I must say that while it may not be a CD you'll listen to straight through, each individual song is a masterpiece.  Kudos to the guys from Manchester!!
0739342371|5.0|Definitely a light chick lit, but that's what I was after.  I loved the book and the reader did an awesome job.  The reader can really make or break an audio book.  This one did a great job.
0060849827|4.0|The product description clearly states the size of the product but I hadn't really paid attention to it. I just knew that this edition of the book is a smaller version, handy to keep in your backpack.    Backpack? Back pocket is more like it. It's about the size of a deck of cards. While that means there's no excuse not to take it with you, it also means that the type is awfully small. If you wear reading glasses be sure to pack a pair or two along with the book.     I would have preferred that they use larger pages and make the book thinner. But I can't really argue with the decision they made. Most people will probably prefer the fatter but smaller dimensions.    The book, by the way, is impressive. Wiseman is indeed a wise man who knows what he's talking about.     If you do buy this book I think you should seriously consider buying its bigger brother, [[ASIN:0060578793 SAS Survival Handbook: How to Survive in the Wild, in Any Climate, on Land or at Sea]] too. That way you'll have the best of both worlds. An easier to read edition for home, which will allow you to read and study it thoroughly and this very small, very portable version you just might want to take everywhere.
B000P7V46C|3.0|And Then There Were Three (because Steve Hackett left during the mixing of the previous album) marks the real transition between \\"old prog Genesis\\" and \\"modern pop Genesis.\\" It has a lot of the elements of the older style, but Phil Collins finally sounds secure in his lead vocals role and writing contributions. My favorite track is the last song, Follow You Follow Me, which previews the stylistic changes to come for this band. This reissue includes an excellent DVD featuring Three Dates With Genesis, a documentary about the 1978 European festival tour. Great stuff. And the standard Reissue Interviews provide good insight from the band themselves about the recording of the album and what was going on at the time.
0316143472|5.0|This book--and this is no surprise I guess--is, in reliable Sedaris style, hilarious and super smart and beyond re-re-re-readable. But also I feel kind of morally improved--maybe this is silly!--by the way you feel forced to kind of open your heart to more and stranger people and situations when you read this.

0385340567|3.0|The reviews for this book are all over the place, some high, many low.  And that is the tipoff that Child has gone astray with \\"Nothing to Lose\\".  While the book starts out teasing us with the usual Jack Reacher come ons of potential violence, mysterious characters, and unknown dangers, it quickly loses focus and interest through a series of implausibilities and incongruities.    Worse,the book is marred by the author's political philosophy and position on the Iraq War as expressed through Reacher--a man heretofore solidly apolitical or pro military at best.  I am as uninterested in an author's political views expressed through his characters than I am in hearing some Hollywood celebrity tell me how to vote or think.      Reacher is Reacher...stoic, tough as nails, maverick, and never intimidated.  Yet this novel takes forever to move in parts, mysteries languish unsolved way too long, and ultimately Reacher makes great leaps of intuition to solve problems or mystery after mystery with seemingly little basis for such ESP.    Several plot lines flow disjointly through \\"Nothing to Lose\\" including religious zealotry, lonely frightened women with missing boyfriends, an unlikely unit of MP's not unlike Reacher's former colleagues, and a town who wants him gone or dead.  Yes, later than sooner, these threads are all tied up but by then you have  reached the point of urging the book to finally end.
B0013FSXSC|4.0|I have a weakness for Sean Connery. Watching him in Blu Ray is devine. Now I have to wait for the blu ray releases of the early Bond movies. But no kidding. First Knight is a good movie. The performance of the actors is OK. I personally don't like Richard Gere and I think Julia Ormond could be included in more scenes. It's good entertainment, nothing more, nothing less.   The image quality is excellent for a movie of this age. Sound is very good. All in all a good blu release.
B00104QSOM|1.0|This was interesting, but did not think it was nearly as good as the other movies nominated for awards this year.  No doubt it would be very difficult to act this character, but movie was still a disappointment.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|After three weeks I finally went out and saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. One of the first things that I noticed is that the theater is still full, even with the release this weekend of [[ASIN:B00164DWEA The Incredible Hulk [Theatrical Release]]]. One other thing that I noticed is that the 15-20 minutes of pre-show commercials have gotten more annoying than ever. I mean, how many times to I have to be pounded with Verizon ads, over and over again? Ugh!<br /><br />But on to the movie. This fourth Indiana Jones effort takes our hero forward 20 years, into 1957. Instead of Nazi's he's now battling Communists. Seriously, what would Indiana do if he didn't have an evil empire to fight with. The attempt here by the film makers is to go back to the original formula of [[ASIN:B00009Q98M Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Widescreen Edition) [Region 2]]], something that was missing in [[ASIN:B000F7OMZ2 Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom - Widescreen Version (1984)]] and only partially there in the [[ASIN:B000F7OPCC Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade - Widescreen Edition]]. We are back to the \\"serial\\" format, where every 10 minutes he's put into an impossible situation only to get himself out again.<br /><br />There are many things to like here. Harrison Ford not only plays a great \\"older\\" Jones but seems to actually embrace it. The return of Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood (now Williams) was better than I expected. Still tough and very much the equal of Jones when it comes to wit. Shia Labeouf plays Marion's son and does a more than credible job. Cate Blanchett and John Hurt both tend to steal scenes and are wonderful additions.<br /><br />But, there are also things here that are not so great. The plot, while starting off well, begins to get a bit hokey. Some of the action sequences have strayed from the unbelievable to the ludicrous. And the resolution of it all almost became silly. Not quite, but almost.<br /><br />Still, overall it was a great escape into two hours of sheer fun. And the final scene with Indy and Marion left open the possibility of another Indiana Jones movie, but with a different hero. Could be interesting!heer fun. And the final scene with Indy and Marion left open the possibility of another Indiana Jones movie, but with a different hero. Could be interesting!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South is one of the most beautiful productions produced by BBC. It features an extremely talented cast, stunning costumes and cinematography, and a message that truly touches the heart. I highly recommend this title both for entertainment and instructional purposes. I believe it relates to modern times as the economy of America is on the brink of Depression. The sufferings of the poor can be seen throughout this film at the cotton mills and can be seen today with rising gas prices and food costs.     The relationship between John and Margaret is also amazing. The chemistry felt between Richard and Daniela is truly mind boggling. You can feel their pain, their loneliness, and their love. It is truly amazing.    Note: Not for those who do not like period dramas! [[ASIN:B000AYEL6U North & South]]
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Picks up right where Season 1 left. Great new stories. More history of the Winchester family's quest interwoven throughout their new adventures.  I throughly enjoyed this one and can't wait for Season 3 to come out on DVD.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|The series needs a couple of episodes to get its bearings but then really digs in. Darker than \\"Doctor Who\\", it is also more interesting in some ways as there are more repeating characters to develop. John Barrowman is a terrific swash buckling Captain with a twinkle in his eye and sorrow there as well. On the other hand, extremely kissable lips. More snogging for everyone please.
B000GYI32M|5.0|I enjoyed the third season of the O.C.  It did go quite a bit heavier that the previous seasons, but most shows do.  Although a lot of this show does not deal in what I would call reality, it does deal well with some real-life situations realistically.  Kirsten's alcoholism, Marissa's experimentation in a same-sex realationship and the fall out from Marissa shooting Ryan's brother Trey.  Spoiler alert!  Obviously it sucks that Marissa was killed off, but think about it, what more could she do.  She is one of the most tragic characters ever on prime time TV.  Overall, this was a great season of The O.C. and I would definitely recommend it.
B00005LC1H|5.0|One of the funniest British Comedies of all times.  Delightful to watch.  Written with intelligence, this is a must have in any video collection.  I am always seeing something new and laughing out loud every time I put this DVD in the player to watch.
B0000009NG|5.0|Of all of Bowie's early glam rock work, this would be his greatest (and least glamorous).  It's a bit vulgar in some areas, and brilliant throughout; Bowie does many creative and talented things in this album, things that you can't hear or feel in the likes of Ziggy Stardust, Bowie's most over-rated album (however decent it is).  The feel of the album is a definite precursor to what you hear in Diamond Dogs and Station to Station: powerful yet discontent, unique yet overwhelmed.  This really is one of those albums that provoke emotion whenever you listen to it.<br /><br />And even better, you get a few bonus tracks with this Ryko edition, yay!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Worst movie I ever seen, no action, dragged out, horrible ending.  Don't waste your money buying it, I would not even watch it on cable.  this movie sucked
0452289963|5.0|This one of the best books I ever read. It gives a clear explanation on how the mind and the ego works. After reading it I feel much better about living in the moment instead of the future or the past. It explains how human often indentify themself with form and believe their own thoughts.   It's hard to explain, just read it! And become aware and awake!
0812975219|3.0|Well, what can I say? The concept of \\"black swamp\\" function is very original and as a professional investor, I appreciate the author's insight into this critical concept to long term return. However, the whole book is about this concept and I don't learn anything new after finishing the first few chapters. Moreover, the author is a trader rather than a writer which probably explain his less-than-perfect reading style. Readers have to be prepared for his \\"non-linear\\" logic and could be very confusing at times.
0446401307|3.0|I love the Harry Bosch character. But this book does not do him justice. I just got the impression reading this that it is not as good as earlier Bosch novels. Maybe Connelly should have pensioned him off and left it that. It seems that resurrecting him might have been an error. Maybe Harry needs one really big case to finish his career off. His FBI love interest needs to go also.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|then the Darjeeling Limited won't disappoint.  However, if you are not a Wes Anderson fan, I'd suggest you skip this film.  Anderson is a master of the quirky, laugh to yourself comedy centered on dysfunctional characters.  While the Darjeeling Limited doesn't measure up to my two favorite Anderson movies, Royal Tennenbaum's and Rushmore, it is not that far behind.<br /><br />Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman and Adrien Brody play three brothers who have grown apart over the years.  Wilson schemes this \\"reunion\\" as a supposed spiritual journey through India aboard the train \\"Darjeeling Limited\\".  Little do Brody and Schwartzman realize that Wilson has brought them together to see their mother who is now at a remote monastery in remote India.<br /><br />Anderson doesn't go for the cheap laughs and isn't about the funny one-liners.  There are plenty of offbeat and hilarious scenes -- the brothers first meal aboard the train is priceless.  There is definitely great chemistry with the three actors as well as some great performances by the secondary Indian characters.  The seminal event occurs when the brothers encounter death in a raging river while trying to rescue three locals.  The death of one of the children causes them to reminisce about their own father's death and begins the process of bringing them closer together.<br /><br />Anderson does a great job with the camera work -- especially capturing the tight quarters of the \\"Darjeeling\\" -- and captures the rich hues of India.  At times, you could almost smell and taste the flavors of India.<br /><br />Once again, this is certainly not a film for everyone.  If you are looking for a standard Hollywood comedy, don't watch this movie.  Anderson doesn't make traditional comedies and this is likely to leave you annoyed and disappointed.  However, if you are a fan of Anderson's, this is well worth the viewing.
0440243661|4.0|This was a great read, typical Jack Reacher. Raw, tough, uncompromising. Lee Child has created a character who every male would love to be able to emulate.
B000002G85|5.0|Clapton's eponymous solo debut encapsulates everything that makes him not just a great picker, but a great musician. Every song is written, sung and played with just the right touch. He has taken the torrential blues of his early bands, mixed in the psychedelic mayhem of Cream, and served it on a bed of tasty country fried pop. Clapton catching his musical breath just before the jump into the stratosphere with brother Duane and the boys.
B000W4KT6E|3.0|There's a lot of things to flat out hate about Hairspray.  The extremely disgusting appearance of John Travolta dressed up as a woman (and not a very believable one either), the overabundance of singing and dancing segments that come across very obnoxiously several times, and the overall fakeness of the entire thing (and I never really could tell whether they were mocking Baltimore or not).    When it comes down to it, I can't get into the movie because all the things I mention above are just too much to tolerate for me.  Maybe for most people this kind of stuff is entertaining, but to me it's just not a funny style of comedy.  If you like singing and dancing \\"plays\\", then check it out.  If not, skip it.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|Just saw this final installment of the Rocky series.  Can't say that I'd been entirely happy about the fact that a new one was going to hit the market.  The last one was abysmal at best.  But this is the best way to end the seminal Rocky series.   The poorer side of Philly is back (and takes a good chunk of the film).   The Rocky we knew as a REAL underdog is back.   Paulie is back.   Hell, even the egg drinking is back.  The best part of this film is that it actually LOOKS like the first Rocky. I'm not sure what camera techniques were used in the making, but the film has that grainy, streetwise look to it, and that strengthens the story even more.   I had NO intention of even seeing this movie, but I'm definitely glad that I'd spent both my money and time to watch it.   This one's most assuredly a keeper.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Este &aacute;lbum es un redescubrimirnto de la banda, tan eclectico, tan contemporaneo... no parece que hubiera pasado tanto tiempo desde el ultimo album. Portishead se renueva, se reinventa y GANA.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Strangely, this is the first review I've done of an Opeth record even though I own 5. Part of it, like all Opeth releases, is that it takes a bit of time for the album to sink in and thanks to the ever-shifting changes in tempo, dynamics and song lengths, sometimes it takes awhile before you really \\"get\\" an Opeth release. Released after their 6th release, \\"Deliverance\\" which was one of their heaviest records, in comes \\"Damnation\\" which is one of their more softer, introspective and dare I say it, gorgeous releases. While some songs are just simply good, others are their best of their whole career.    Windowpane: With its eerie guitar chord intro, the album opens and leads into a gorgeous track complete with 2 great guitar solos and an effective bridge at 2:24 with guitars playing the same riff but out-of-sync. Longest track and a great opener. 9.5/10    In My Time of Need: Very chime-y guitar arpeggios start off though strangely I'm not a fan of the halted verse melody though of course that changes with the pre-chorus which leads into the chorus that really shows off Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals. Outro goes on a bit too long but oh well. 9/10    Death Whispered a Lullaby: Upbeat title no? Anyway, the opening acoustic riff is catchy and the chorus is another Akerfeldt standout but the song as a whole I never could get into all that much. I like the Pink Floyd-esque guitar solo though. 7.5/10    Closure: Emotive vocals and 12-string acoustics start us off before we get a repeating riff and few instances of distortion, and ending with a riff sounding like from the Middle East and more ethnic drumming until it unexpectedly cuts off. It's decent and I like parts of it, just not the whole. 6/10    Hope Leaves: A quite gorgeous song with everything from the chime-y arpeggios like track 2, Akerfeldt's vocals (I love the pre chorus), backing vocals from male to an ethereal female, this is easily one of the best songs on the album. 9.5/10    To Rid the Disease: A beautiful-yet-eerie guitar riff starts off the track and the chorus is pretty enough though it's not really stunning either. But adding the piano to mimic the guitar riff is a nice touch and the piano riff after the solo is absolutely gorgeous and very simple. It's one of those I like the song but love its parts. Weird, I know. 8/10    Ending Credits: Strangely, the title doesn't mean it's the last track of the album. It's an instrumental with an acoustic guitar providing simple chord progressions before the 2nd guitar basically solo's riffs throughout the whole thing. It's a fun song to play and it's peaceful though not really a put-on-repeat one. 8/10    Weakness: Strange organ sounds sounding sci-fi-esque and very minimal guitar playing makes this a very lowkey album closer though for a record like this, it seems oddly appropriate. Nice bit of winding down and nice to listen to though it probably won't go on your iPod...unless you got chill-out music on there. 8/10    It would be easy to recommend buying Damnation if you're not an Opeth fan already since it's so different than the others; on the other hand, it's for that reason why it's maybe not the best \\"starter\\" release since the others will surprise you. But still, it would be a shame if you didn't check out this release anyway.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have already reviewed the book by Stephen Ambrose and the same I have to say here. Excellent. When you start watching the series you pop in DVD after DVD in your player to see how the guys from Easy Company are doing. Sad, but true, that there are not more TV prductions out there like this one.
0316067601|3.0|First, what amazing men Luttrell and his fellow SEALs are and everyone who enjoys the freedom and security of living in the USA should be thankful that men like this exist.  I read that more college football players will be drafted to the NFL this year than men will become Navy Seals- puts the \\"elite\\" statement about Seals into perspective.    There is an undertone of conservative politics in the book, but it doesn't detract from the book as some negative reviews state. The real detraction is the writing.  Unfortunately, Marcus Luttrell should have interviewed a few more writers before deciding who would write his story.  Patrick Robinson, who wrote the story, did a sophomoric job, which does not rise to the standard that Luttrell's story should be written.  The writing is so bad through the first quarter of the book, it is almost painful.  However, it does improve when the action gets underway, and you are feeling for his team mates and cheering Marcus on to the point where you want to cry in happiness with him when he's rescued.   It's a five star story, written by a one star writer, so I gave it a three for that reason.
B000I5XOVY|4.0|I think I mainly liked this movie for the great blu-ray clarity and the fact that it wasn't your typical action movie.  The picture is astonishingly clear and vivid through blu-ray conversion.  John Travolta plays a fairly decent bad guy and the story has some twists that keep your attention.  I thought the plot was rather ridiculous though, but definitely an original.  The motive for the characters wasn't just for a lot of money, like every other boring action movie, but the actual use of the money was the motivation. Good guy needed money to get his daughter back, bad guy needed money for anti-terrorism in his own demented way. Nothing great, but overall, a fun movie to watch on blu-ray.
0802130208|4.0|As the title for this review suggests, Confederacy of Dunces has some HST similarities.  This book is a wild and fun ride; interesting and unexpected twists, with sharp dialog.  Apart from the entertainment value is the amazement at the creative mind that spun this tale.  It is truly a work of comedic genius.

B001794FOK|5.0|I bought this dvd and at first had a terrible time trying to play this movie on my blu-ray.  The problem some Sharp Aquos BDHP20U blu-ray player owners might have is that when the movie starts the video gets all jumbled up but you can still hear the sound.  At first I thought it was the dvd and exchanged it for another one but the same thing happened.  Thats when after doing a search online I saw I had to update my firmware with the newest patch and once I did the movie played fine.  So if any other people who have the same blu-ray player are having this same problem I advise checking online for the newest patch to install before taking back the dvd.

1400064287|5.0|I just finished reading Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die. In this wonderful book on communicating ideas so that people will remember them the author has 6 principles:        * Simplicity - Find the core or your idea, don't bury the lead of your story      * Unexpectedness - Surprise will get people's attention      * Concreteness - Ideas that are concrete on more memorable than those that are abstract      * Credibility - Authorities or details can be used to increase credibility      * Emotions - People will remember what they care about      * Stories - Stories are useful to get people to act on an idea    I find that I examine communication ideas now through the lens of these principles. A friend pointed out a good example of these principles in an ad from the American Lung Association. Kids know that cigarettes are bad for them but how can you truly get that message across in a way that is in this case simple, unexpected, concrete and emotional. One third of the people who smoke will die from it. That's the statistic. How to communicate that? The American Lung Association made this ad that equated what it would be like if you had a one in three changes in dying by crossing the street. This is an idea that is made to stick.

When I watched Eckhart talking with Oprah on her radio live and any time on the tv I get a calmness that comes over me like never before. This is the book that will change our world and those of us that have read it are doing that already. Thank you Eckhart, Oprah and Amazon for enabling me.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The battle of Normandy came to life for me in this series.  When I finished watching this film I felt a sense of gratitude and love for the soldiers who fought in WWII that will never diminish.  I think every adult American should see this mini series, which is a brutal but honest account of men who fought and died while trying to stop the advance of Hitler.  I wept, I laughed, I cheered, felt agony, and experienced victory- all while watching Band of Brothers.  It was the most powerful film I have ever seen, and I think it always will be.
0786948523|1.0|Ok, so I'm reviewing the Monster Manual book more than the way the creatures work. They're just a bunch of worthless stat blocks, so they work just fine, but that's what they are: working stat blocks.<br /><br />First, let me say that I don't like the artwork. In old monster manuals, there were a lot of monsters that you might fight just because you were at odds with them, or you might not even fight them at all. They could be allies. Take giants for example, the art was of some giant people that looked pretty cool, and some pre-made 3.5 campaigns included them as allies. But in this book, they look ridiculously evil. In fact, everything looks evil. It just looks like they filled the book with things to fight, not think about, which I think it less imaginative and therefore more boring. Even the treant is evil.<br /><br />MORE IMPORTANTLY...There is no flavor.<br /><br />Take the Shambling Mound.<br /><br />In version three, it has Four Paragraphs of description. In version four it has 1 sentence. A single sentence. And then listen to the description of its ability.<br /><br />This is a direct quote of version 4:<br /><br />\\"The shambling mound makes two basic attacks. If both attacks hit the same Medium or smaller target, the shambling mound makes a secondary attack against the target. Secondary Attack: +12 vs. Fortitude; the target is pulled into the shambling mound's space and restrained (save ends). While the target is restrained, no creature has line of sight or line of effect to it. At the start of the shambling mound's turn each round, the enveloped target takes 10 damage and the shambling mound regains 10 hit points. The shambling mound can envelop up to 2 creatures at a time. When the target makes its save, it reappears in a square of its choice adjacent to the shambling mound.\\"<br /><br />It's so dull. It just gives you all the tactical information to play out the game. It's just rules without anything interesting or imaginative. Monsters have lost tons of cool abilities like swallow whole that require some really imaginative thinking. And Lycanthropes just give you a disease. I feel like 4th edition reduces everything to statistics. The game takes place on a board in stead of in your imagination.<br /><br />I just can't believe that the Monster Manual took all the fun out of monsters. They all seem evil, and there's pretty much no description of them anymore. I just used to have so much fun learning about monsters and their abilities. It's just sort of sad to see them reduced to mere enemies as opposed to interested creatures with backstories and cool characteristics.<br /><br />I suppose the book doesn't deserve a 1, but I miss the way things used to be. It's a perfectly acceptable book that does everything it needs to, but it doesn't delve further into things like before, and that's what I thought D&D was about.really imaginative thinking.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Several years ago Azon included a Leonard Maltin review in the notes, and it was obvious by the review that he either hadn't seen the movie, or at least hadn't paid attention, he had characters and scenes out of place.  I posted a review that said (more or less), who cared what Maltin had to say about anything anyway.  Believe it or not, apparently Maltin read the page, took umbrage with my comments, managed to get Azon to reveal my personal information, and actually had an assistant call me at work to complain about my comments!  True story.

My first impression was that only 2 or 3 songs were really good, but after repeat listening I have found that the album as a whole is very good listening.  I'm not a huge fan of of the harsh vocals (most apparent on the title track), but I really enjoy this album in its entirety.  If you like any of the previous Testament albums, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this album.  I'm glad I bought it, and I am realy enjoying it in my playlist.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Is there a band out there producing music more interesting than Elbow?  Nothing jumps to my mind.  Elbow is a band hitting its creative stride.  They have a distinct sound, not entirely all its own, but close enough that one could pick out an Elbow song if hearing it for the first time.  One thing is for sure...the band has listened to a few Pink Floyd records in its time.  There is a definite Floyd influence here (Some Riot).  Some suggest Guy Garvey's voice is similar to that of Peter Gabriel.  I really don't hear that too much.  This album is not for the casual listener.  Similar to a movie with an intricate plot, this album requires the listener to stay focused and actively listen to get the full affect. This is definitely not background music as one reviewer here writes.  There is so much going on here.  It is as if the songs have a main musical plot with many other musical subplots swirling around it. (Maybe best illustrated by One Day Like This).  This entices the listener to stay tuned into all that is going on.  And also should help in the longevity of the album, allowing it to hold up over time.  This multilayered sound is not easy to pull off without sounding cluttered and forced.  Elbow pulls it off here with beautiful results.  The Seldom Seen Kid is a remarkable album.  Hopefully they will gain a bigger audience with this one.    EDIT 3/29/11:  Changed rating to 5 stars.  This album has held up over the 3 years since its release.  It is now one of my favorite albums of the last 10 years.
140130916X|5.0|Loved the book, love the movie. First thought that Hilary Swank would be a mis-cast, NO WAY, she was wonderful!    I watch it over and again. Just one of those love stories that actually are spot on. Right up there with \\"Love Actually\\", \\"You've got Mail\\" \\"The Holiday\\".
B00168ML1G|4.0|Really enjoyed this film for the first 90 minutes, until it became a predictable super robot movie. Robert Downey, Jr. is technical whiz Tony Stark, the ne'er-do well scion of a weapons manufacturer. He has a social awakening after being captured by Afghan warriors during a product demo, and decides that his company must change course. One of his first designs is a power suit, propelled by a new source of his own devising.<br /><br />Downey is perfect for the job. His dry acting style and bad-boy persona are perfect for depicting the driven and hard-driving protagonist. He is completely believable with booze or blond in hand. Gwyneth Paltrow trots out her American accent to play Stark's all-knowing assistant. Jeff Bridges is completely believable as Stark's corporate partner, uniting uncleish bonhomie with more sinister motivations. The special effects are terrific, but made believable (and often funny) with scenes of Stark test-piloting his new equipment. A scene (shown in the trailer) of Stark outrunning a couple of stealth fighters is harrowing and plenty exciting.<br /><br />Iron Man does a lot (mostly thanks to Downey) with borrowed materials. There's a know-all female assistant (a la 007's Moneypenny), a technical wunderkind (a la Batman) and foreign bad guys (a la Vin Diesel). Still, the film is rocket-solid until about the 3/4 mark, when it tumbles securely into the old cliche mismatched superhero battle. There's never a question of who will win, and it would have been refreshing if the plot had allowed for fewer explosions, close calls and destroyed cityscapes.  A quickie, surprise ending would have been better than the 20-minute, predictable mini-Armageddon that threatened to drop this review to 3 stars.<br /><br />A fun ride, with a setup (after 10 minutes of credits) for what promises to be a lame sequel.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie is entirely done, deliberately poorly, with marionettes.  While the action constantly reminds you that the actors are all puppets on strings the sets and effects are amazing and the soundtrack is worth purchasing on it's own.<br /><br />If you enjoy South Park or Baseketball then give this movie a try.
B0006J28KU|3.0|This is a great movie, don't get me wrong.  The problem is though that I find myself having to constantly change the volume as I am watching it.  Some of the dialogue seems practically silent so I turn it up, then they have loud music or a helicopter or something and bam, I think I've blown out my speakers.  The movie is easily a five and this might just be me but having to constantly grab for the remote control when watching this movie has always taken away from the experience for me.

B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" is a classic animation masterpiece by Hiyao Miyazaki.  In this reviewers opinion, Miyazaki is the greatest animated storyteller and visionary since the late Walter Elias Disney.  This film is justifiably considered his greatest.  It won the Academy Award for best animated feature the year of it's release.    Chihiro is an 11 year old brat.  Her family is moving and she doesn't like it one bit.  To make things worse, her father makes the wrong turn.  He then insists on investigating what appears to be an abandoned theme park.  However things aren't what they seem, with the setting of the sun, things begin to transform including her parents.  Aided by a mysterious boy, Haku, Chihiro learns to survive in this spirit word.  She gets a job at a bath house for the spirits run by the witch Yubaba.     In the process of adapting to her new situation, Chihiro grows tremendously. In order to save herself and her family, she going to display reservoirs of strength and resourcefulness she didn't know she had.  Miyazaki handles this realistically.  As Chihiro adapts to her situation, her emotions range from confusion to terror to resignation through bouts of depression.  Nonetheless she prevails and even finds friendship, loyalty and love.     She also bumps her head a lot......literally.    The detail of Miyagi's work is incredible.  Look at the details of the boiler room where Chihiro meets Komagi, Yubaba's office, the details of bathhouse operation etc.  Miyagi bases his characters on actual people.  `Chihiro' is based on the daughter of a close friend.  Her parents had no idea he had been studying her so closely.    The DVD includes extras primarily about the making of the film including it dubbing in English.  There is also a Japanese documentary about Studio Ghibli.  It's interesting a work of such beauty can be produced under such crowded, cluttered working conditions
B000VBP38C|2.0|My daughter and I were very much disappointed with this movie.  We might have been more impressed had we not seen Colin Firth's and Jennifer Ehle's version of Pride and Prejudice first.  The movie seemed rushed. Sometimes the characters spoke far too fast so you had no clue as to what they were saying. Some of the essential characters were cut from the story. Mr. Bingley was a real goofball. The only noteworthy enhancements  from the Firth & Ehle version were Jane and Mr. Wickham characters. This is not a slight against Keira Knightley because she is as beautiful as I would expect Elizabeth Bennett to be.  However, Jennifer Ehle was perfection as Elizabeth Bennett, and Colin Firth is the sexiest.  Had I seen this movie before I purchased it, I would have saved my money.  I'm not saying that the acting was terrible because the actors worked very will with what they had.  However, some things are better left alone and not attempted.  That is, the mold was absolutely broken after Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle version of Pride and Prejudice was made.
B00139W3NE|5.0|I read the negative reviews before I saw the movie.  My husband said it was good so I decided to check it out for myself (a free thinking adult).      Well, I enjoyed it & saw no anti religion, anti god or anti christian agenda at all.  It does encourage free thinking, so in that sense,  I guess it would be viewed as dangerous by those who don't like to question their religious dogma or have it questioned by others, especially if they are in the business of selling you \\"salvation\\".  I got a chuckle out of the reviewer who claimed Golden Compass was \\"brainwashing\\" for kids, as it is just the opposite.    As for comments comparing it to Narnia, I think it's silly.  Narnia is a repackaging of the christian mythology with 1) the lion playing Jesus & being tortured, killed & coming back to life, 2) the \\"Judas\\" brother betraying the \\"good\\" guys, 3) the silly lies about witches being \\"evil\\" people.  Pretty transparent.      Golden Compass encourages compassion, free thinking, free will, right action (doing what is right) & fighting against evil.  It teaches kids that when bad adults tell them to do something wrong, it is absolutely ok to rebel. It was refreshing to see this movie breaking away from the typical Hollywood misrepresentation of witches being evil & bad.    Other than the one short battle scene, I enjoyed the story, the message, the visuals & the actors.
0385340567|4.0|I am a thriller fan, and immediately got hooked on the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child as soon as I started reading ONE SHOT, the ninth book in the series, which I happened to pick up while browsing at my local book seller. The few excerpts below from my Amazon review of that book (6/30/2005) will indicate why I gave it one of only three 5+ Star ratings that I have ever awarded.    \\"I found this thriller by Lee Child to be not only extremely compelling as the story rushed towards its crescendo, but also extraordinarily enjoyable as well. The factor that most differentiated ONE SHOT from the majority of other thrillers was the author's wonderful use of seemingly minor details to bring his central character Jack Reacher (and a few of the other characters as seen through Reacher's eyes) into extremely sharp focus for me as a reader...    'Jack Reacher is a man who lives off the grid - in effect a man with [figuratively speaking] no face, no forwarding address, and seemingly a man who has effectively ceased to exist.    'Is this story realistic? Of course not! Would the series of coincidences combined with Reacher's extraordinary powers and unbelievable investigative ability strain your credulity if you sat back to analyze this book as you were reading it? Of course! In this regard this shares the attributes of all great thrillers, they suck the reader into the story - the action is so fast paced and forces of evil opposing the lone hero seem so the powerful that the reader is captivated by the flow of events and his desire to learn how good will triumph in the end and who will have died along the way...    'So this is a thriller with a superhero as the central character - a police procedural with an investigator of unmatched abilities - and finally an action story... and allows him to execute his fiendishly clever plan for righting the wrongs which have so offended his sense of justice and morality. ONE SHOT hit all the right notes for me, and while many of the nuances which I enjoyed so much may not be quite as appealing to a broad range of readers, I think that most individuals who enjoy this genre will agree that this is a well above average entry in that category.\\"    I have now read the three books published subsequently to ONE SHOT and backfilled by reading four of the first eight books in the series; while it is still my favorite partly for the personal reasons outlined in that review (particularly the use of baseball analogies), this is the first of the eight that I have read that I did not believe was of five star quality. Interestingly, Amazon reviewers to date widely share that opinion, with few five star ratings and a great many one star reviews, which I understand but with which I strongly disagree, and which I believe are partially a function of the high expectations which Child has created for readers of this series and which clearly were not fulfilled by NOTHING TO LOSE.     I was not only disappointed but very frustrated when I finished the story, because it had many of the trademark elements which I have come to expect from the series but there impact was diluted by several factors. Sorry that I will have to be very general, especially with my criticisms, but I don't want to repeat the mistake of several disappointed reviewers of discussing essential plot elements which are often not revealed until late in the book.     First, THE GOOD. The plot backdrop - after entering Colorado Jack Reacher traverses the road from the town of HOPE to the town of DESPAIR, and is quickly arrested as a vagrant and deported back to the waiting police officer Vaughn at the Hope town line. She and her absent husband gradually become essential components of Reacher's quest to right the injustice of interfering with one of his \\"organizing principles, relentless forward motion\\". The situation quickly becomes more complicated and the stakes increase dramatically as Reacher tries to understand the great divide which exists between the citizens of Hope and Despair despite their geographic proximity. The classic Jack Reacher morality play with several intertwined plots gradually evolves. And all the wonderful details are there. His mental acuity, his minimalist (really non-existent baggage - emotional as well as physical), the details that make the story rush along and the action so compelling, are mostly on a par with the other books in the series. In comparison to some other reviews, I thought that the detail was quintessential Reacher, and rather than being tedious made the plot rush along. I did not want to put the book down. I also felt aspects of Vaughn's personal story added immensely to the book. The story is told in the third person, as is the majority of the series for reasons which Child discusses on his website. I think that choice for this novel adds too its effectiveness.    Next, THE BAD. Several details of the plot seem implausible to the point of impossibility, even for this series. Also, very uncharacteristically, there are several actions of various which remain unexplained, in contrast to Child's usual meticulous attention to tying up all loose ends. Certain actions of one of the secondary characters in particular and the townspeople of Despair in general were either unexplained or incongruous.    Finally, THE TRULY UGLY. Four central and completely intertwined elements of the plot all bore on issues that might best be described as inciting great flurries of political correctness. (There are a lot of spoilers in other reviews, and I can't get into detail without also including spoilers.) I think that with minor modifications in three cases they could have remained central elements of the plot and perhaps even have made the story better, but in the last case the decision to have Reacher expound on a controversial political item seemed totally out of character with all the previous novels in the series that I have read. (I am not as convinced as many reviewers that this was simplythe author taking advantage of his captive readers to espouse his views, but the manner and context in which it occurred was both unnecessary and a jarring inconsistency in my opinion. At the least it needed more context to be an effective plot device.) I expect political commentary when I read the Mitch Rapp novels by Vince Flynn, another of my favorite series and a character who shares some superficial similarities with Jack Reacher, including his disdain for politicians and government bureaucracy. But not in this series, and certainly not in this heavy handed a manner at a crucial moment in the story. Now I understand why the New York Times gave it an absolutely glowing much more enthusiastic review than most Amazon reviewers, their reviewer loved all the liberal stereotypes. For her, they improved Jack Reacher, for most readers they detracted from the story.    This book works as a standalone story; as usual Child gradually works enough detail into the narrative so that readers do not need to be familiar with the series to follow the storyline. However, I strongly advise anyone unfamiliar with the series to either start with KILLING FLOOR and read the series in the order published, or to start with ONE SHOT to get a feeling for Child and Reacher at their best. Hopefully, this book was an aberration and the five star stories will return; while disappointed I still plan to read the next installment in the series as soon as it is released and want to reemphasize tat while disappointed that I still did enjoy spending time once again with Jack Reacher, even if subpar story was the vehicle which enabled us to get reacquainted.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a latecomer to this all too short series, having seen the movie by accident on cable a few months ago for the first time. I was hooked and purchased the DVD of the series, and what a fine series it was. It's is all about the delightful interaction between the characters and their adventures together, and it never lets you down. It just makes you sad that there weren't a lot more.

0061015725|5.0|Whoa!  What a wild tale!  Thank goodness it's only fiction.  Still, I think the cautionary part of this narrative is that stuff like this happens all the time, with very few people knowing about it, and dire consequences affecting everyone can result.  This is a very thought-provoking book.  Crichton is at his finest as a storyteller.
B000VM9Z8K|3.0|I read all of the Shopaholic books and a few others by Kinsella. I confess, Remember Me? was a disappointment compared to Kinsella's other books.  I don't believe I lauhged out loud once, which is unusual for a Kinsella book.
B000YJ54DU|2.0|I hate it when celebs, including authors, inject their political bias into their work...especially escape fiction.  That's what Lee Child did.  I guess I am about done with Jack Reacher....he's turned into a Hollywonk...he's sort of a wierdo anyway....good thing he's fictional...your average USMC Boot Camp Grad could whip his butt without blinking.  I used to think I'd go see a Jack Reacher movie and thought Tom Selleck would be a good actor to protray him...now I think it's definitely Alec Baldwin....that'd keep me out of the theater!!!
B0016AJU2C|4.0|The first few songs are hard-hitting and ring in your head. The last half of the cd is now growing on me, as the sound of the cd, overall, is great. I'm sure this has a lot to do with the producer of the cd, who used to be part of Frou Frou, with Imogen Heap. This is a suitable sound for the modern Alanis.
1400079179|4.0|Usually, when someone has to say something like \\"relax -- it's just a story!\\" it means that the work in question is trash.<br /><br />Good stories normally don't require a defense; they are their own justification.<br /><br />But, it seems that Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is one of those rare instances of a good story that does require a defense beyond simply pointing to the work. Why should this be so? I think it's 1) due to the enormous popular success this book has enjoyed, and 2) the faux-seriousness of its subject matter (i.e., how it \\"blasphemes\\"). If The Da Vinci Code didn't somehow become a mainstream hit, and didn't strike some people's sacrosanct nerves, I doubt anyone would be so incensed as to try to tear it down, as people obviously do.<br /><br />To begin with, The Da Vinci Code is a good book. What Dan Brown understands -- and better than most contemporary authors -- is the art of suspense. His management of information, leading cliffhanger to cliffhanger, and always making sure that the pressure is on, is superb. I grant that the book is shy in terms of classroom literary aesthetics, but what of that? It isn't every author's dream to compete with Beckett or Joyce; some simply want to construct stories. Some might say that Brown's characterization is flat, or obvious, etc., or that his situations are cliche -- one of the Spotlight Reviewers here complains at the use of an albino monk, but is that any more preposterous than Hugo's Hunchback, or Shakespeare's Caliban? The question about whether Robert Langdon is Indiana Jones Mk. II, or not, misses the point -- none of those elements would mean a thing if the work as a whole were poorly constructed. It isn't whether he uses archetypes, but whether he uses them to good effect or not.<br /><br />By aiming all of the darts of their critiques at those areas where Brown isn't much concerned, they miss the genius of his work. It is as though they think the book has sold all of those copies by accident. Brown's strength is in his pacing, and in his clarity of communication, and in his clean descriptions, and in his mastery of the elements of suspense. By incorporating elements of popular culture, conspiracy, and some fascinating (if not always accurate) historical detail, Brown creates a monster of a book that doesn't *need* powerful metaphors or poetic descriptions to do what he wants it to do.<br /><br />I take it that most of Brown's critics must believe that what he does is, somehow, easy. That, if literary authors left off trying to reinvent language, and tried their hardest to just hammer out a story that could grab people by the hair and pull them through a plot... well, they could do it in an instant. I'd like to suggest that there's more talent in doing something like that than they realize, and that Brown could probably write a \\"deep, literary\\" novel faster than they could construct a would-be megahit.<br /><br />Brown's book isn't, perhaps, what you want it to be.

006441034X|5.0|This book is the best fantasy book I've ever read. It has very well developed characters and a unique plot that spins the reader into a vortex of imagination, humor, and fun. It has unlikely characters that you can watch develop while the story line twists and turns that keeps you from looking past the next bend. The ending was surprising and the book was very neatly wrapped up. A thoroughly enjoyable read that made me laugh and cry along with the characters. You honestly feel like you're inside the book, alongside the characters with their conflicts. Diana Wynne Jones has done a wonderful accomplishment creating such a fantastic book, a page turner that is the best book I've read in a long time.     It begins with an eldest daughter named Sophie, stuck into thinking that the eldest daughters have the dullest lives. She works in her family's hat shop, making beautiful and popular hats for the local women. Then,adventure comes when she angers the Witch of the Waste, and gets cursed to be an old woman.     So the adventure starts, with Sophie meeting the wizard Howl, and finding plenty of mystery and adventure inside his castle, including striking a deal with a fire demon, fleeing from a scarecrow, and meeting the Witch of the Waste, while discovering her own magic.     A tale of romance and self-discovery, this book is highly recommended. The best book by D.W.J. yet.

B000002GQL|5.0|I've liked The Moody Blues since I can't remember when... All of the classic seven albums from 1967 to 1972 have great songs but, for me, this is their finest and most consistent - it flows really well from start to finish and leaves you wanting more.     For one thing it contains my absolute favourite Lodge compositions 'I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band)' and 'Isn't Life Strange' - sure, these songs are available on every Moody Blues hits collection, but it's great hearing them in context...    Also, if you like this album it's well worth your while giving 'Blue Jays' by Justin Hayward and John Lodge a listen.  It was released a couple of years after Seventh Sojourn, and even though it's not a Moody Blues album as such, it's a more worthy 'follow-up' than 1978's Octave.
0156034026|5.0|Of course, I hate that word.  It implies something false about Islam, relegating it to the Western understanding of religion, and forcing another culture to conform to the standards of our own.  This is why most Islamicists (those who study Islam) prefer the term Islamist rather than Fundamentalist, for Islam is inherently a religion that turns to the fundamentals.  At best, Islamic Fundamentalist is redundant. But sadly, the term Islamist has not yet caught on with the general public, and so we are reduced to using poor terms in order to make ourselves understood.<br /><br />I've never come across a format quite like this before.  It bore certain similarities to the Dear Reader style of the past, recently so well articulated in [[ASIN:0099490579 The City of Dreaming Books]].  But Hamid had a very unusual twist.  Everything is from the first person perspective of the protagonist in the short conversation which frames the book.  You really hear no other voice but that of Changez; we only know his thoughts, and only those thoughts that he chooses to express.  This is a conversation with only one person.<br /><br />Far from being a gimmick, this approach is central to the novel, and to the amazing ending.  We follow the changes in the life of Changez, and more importantly his philosophy of life, and we are gripped from beginning to end.  There wasn't a moment when I got bored.  There wasn't a line in the novel that I felt misplaced, or where too much was added.  The novel weaves between the centerpiece conversation at the cafe and the story of Changez' life, and somehow, Hamid weaves both together as one tapestry.<br /><br />Changez is sitting in a cafe with a nervous American in Pakistan.  Hamid's intricate description of the cafe and surrounding square brought back personal memories of Djamma f'naa in Marrakesh, Morocco, and Hamid describes so vividly I felt like I was back in the square, with it's sellers and food vendors.  Hamid accurately captures the Middle Eastern ability to observe others intimately, as well as common American misconceptions and misreadings of life around them.  (Such as the common perception that Middle Eastern cities are more dangerous than American cities, when the inverse is true, about a hundred times over.)  This was a completely believable American, and a completely believable Pakistani.<br /><br />Changez' backstory is also gripping.  I wanted to know what happened next to the characters.  I still find it hard to believe that this is a work of fiction- the characters are drawn that real.  There was only one moment that was not as believable- that of the sexual relations between Changez and Erica.  Until I realized that they accurately modeled the relationship between America and the West that Hamid was trying to illustrate.  America can't have a satisfying relationship with another country.  It can only do so if that other country pretends to be something it's not- pretends to be culturally something much closer to the American view of the world. If that other country denies its own culture, than America can deal with it, and happily so.<br /><br />And this relationship between countries and cultures is of course the underlying theme of Hamid's work.  You may not agree with Hamid, or Changez.  (For the book has the feel that it is somewhat autobiographical.)  You may be intensely patriotic, and ra-ra for America.  But this book more than any other I've read helps to explain how someone can become an Islamist, and what leads them to see the U.S. as an enemy of all the values that their own culture holds dear.  You may not agree at the end that America is an empire.  But you will at least understand how others perceive us in this way.  For as I have known too many Americans who act like the American in the cafe in Pakistan, I also have known too many Muslims (and indeed, many foreign non-Muslims) who have come to the same conclusions as Changez does.<br /><br />How I wish I could discuss the endingwith you.  For that ending goes rather to the heart of the issues of what it means to be an Islamist, and what it means to be empire.  I will leave you with that thought to contemplate as you close the last page of the book, and consider a [[ASIN:0060850523 brave new world]].<br /><br />Also recommended:  [[ASIN:0849945305 Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger: Moving from Affluence to Generosity by Ron Sider]], for its description of how America lives off the back of the 2/3rds World.art of the issues of what it means to be an Islamist, and what it means to be empire.

1592402038|2.0|Frankly, I'm puzzled over the hype about this book.  I have always been annoyed with mistakes in spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  But even I had trouble making it through this book.  Sure, there were interesting and funny sections.  And I even cleared up a few punctuation rules that weren't clear to me before.  However, there were parts I found downright boring.  It seems like the average person cares less about punctuation than I do, so how did this get on the best-seller list?  I am glad I read it, though, because I did learn something.  It's also good to know there are people out there who care about punctuation even more than I do!

It basically takes you through everything you need to know to brew your first batch, and it helps you improve it and understand what might have gone wrong.   I wouldn't recommend it as the first thing you read when starting up, as you need some basic knowledge in order to fully benefit from the book. But it's really helpful, especially once you've brewed a few batches.
B00011CZRE|4.0|Seven is a well-made crime drama, with an excellent and suspenseful score by Howard Shore. Note: On the back of the DVD case, it is written that the film is presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio; however, this is not the case.  The DVD is presented in 2.35:1 aspect ratio and enhanced for widescreen (16:9) TVs.      The picture and sound are of very high quality.

6305428042|4.0|Great cast. Bette Midler sure makes a good witch. Good story line and direction. Great music and CGI. Two thumbs up. I almost would like a 5 star
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie is difficult to watch for some of the people who actually lived under the surveillance of the Stasi in East Germany. I know some of them. It has such a realistic feel of the times, the environment, and the fear of the people. You look at them through the eyes of a watcher. You feel sympathy for the pressed but also for the oppressors and what their jobs did to their sensitivities. You have to rejoice in their final freedom and emotional release but with sadness for the long wait in torment.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Alien sequels were as good as the original.  Sigourney Weaver is fabulous, perfect for this role. This is very good series of this genre. This genre is not my favorite but this is my favorite of the genre. Great CGI, very good script and cast. Very good direction by Ridley Scott and James Cameron. For horror buffs this is definitely 5 stars
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Ben Kingsly was Gandhi, in appearance, in demeanor, in manner. His greatest role as the world's greatest leader and humanitarian.  This movie should be seen by everyone. It is a beautifully made film about India, about Indians, about human beings, and last of all about Mahatma Gandhi, the inspiration to billions.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Let me first say that I grew up listening to groups like the Eagles and America ... I'm 54.  I was given this CD(s) a few months ago but was so busy I didn't get a chance to listen to it until yesterday.  This is as good as any Eagle's music I've ever heard ... it's absolutely great.    Ignore the reviews that give less than 4 stars.
B000OVLBHG|1.0|It is apparent that the director, Paul Verhoeven, has little respect for Robert Heinlein. He butchered a great and controversial story, and left us with a disaster of a film. Please don't bother watching this film. I do encourage you to read the book by Robert Heinlein. Even if one doesn't agree with Heinlein, he does cause the reader to think deeply about important matters, such as, \\"What is a just society.\\"<br /><br />Verhoeven's film doesn't encourage one to think. I wonder if Verhoeven read the book since the story in the film bears little resemblance to Heinlein's novel. For example, Heinlein valued public service. I can't tell what Verhoeven values except for indulgence.<br /><br />I would give this less than one star if possible.
B0013ND30W|5.0|I am in the Sleeping Beauty camp.  This is the first film I remember seeing in a movie theater in 1959, I was all of three years-old but the imagery has remained with me and this is my favorite of all the \\"Fairy Tales\\" Walt put out.<br /><br />I can't wait for the Blu-ray release (and this coming from a former HD DVD fan.)  But you go with the flow with high def.  Anyone who gets a prescreen copy let me know, I don't have a lot of patience.<br /><br />I am looking forward to real reviews once the discs are out.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|So, sadly, last week was the first time I'd viewed this movie. However, I can bring something new to the table because I'm not knowledgeable (yet) about Batman. To me, this was a greatly entertaining film that was beautiful to look had, had absolutely grand actors (Walken and DeVito stood out for me), and a plot that was easy to grasp for a noob like me.     What I especially enjoyed was this film explored the villains more than I expected it would, and Penguin was just too cool to not enjoy. If you're a fan of Batman, any of the actors, great costumes, or into gothic culture, you'll probably dig this movie.     Enjoyable, macabre and entertaining!
B00177Y9ZM|2.0|As a film, Jumper just begs to be mindless fun, of which it had loads of potential to be.  However, Doug Liman's adaptation of Steven Gould's novel ends up being anything but, and is nowhere near as fun or enjoyable as it could have been.  Hayden Christensen broods his way all over the screen as David Rice, a man with the ability to teleport anywhere in the world just by thinking it.  He's pretty much enjoying life, until meeting fellow \\"jumper\\" Griffin (Jamie Bell) and learning that there has been a centuries long war between the jumpers and the Paladins, of which is Roland (a blonde haired Samuel L. Jackson) who will stop at nothing to put an end to David.  Christensen is just so stiff and unconvincing in the lead role that watching him becomes a plain bore.  In fact, the cast as a whole just comes off that way, including Jackson, and wasted roles for Diane Lane, Kristen Stewart, Tom Hulce, Michael Rooker, and Rachel Bilson as David's love interest.  Jamie Bell on the other hand is so good that the Amazon review stating that one will wish both he and Christensen had switched roles could not be further from the truth.  Liman's direction is frentic to be sure, but the special effects sequences are surprisingly disappointing to behold.  Considering Jumper's troubled production history, none of this really comes off as much of a surprise, but the potential was here to have an incredibly fun time that just gets basically wasted.  It isn't anything terrible, but Jumper definitely isn't anything to write home about either.
B000X418UE|4.0|I've always been a fan of this movie, the Rock.  Michael Bay catches a lot of flak about his Hollywood-esque action movies, but you can't find anyone that knows action better than him.  This movie proved his abilities and put him on the map as an action director.  The scenes are beautiful.  Wonderful, colorful shots followed by more wonderful shots.  The cast is full of great actors too like Sean Connery, Ed Harris, and Michael Beihn.      The disc itself is a great testament to HD media.  Very clear picture, especially for a movie 12-13 years old.  The audio will blow you away.  Extremely crisp and LOUD.  It's also packed full of extras, although some are really quite useless.  Most extras are in standard def too.    I paid $15 for this movie.  Being one of my all-time favorite action flicks, I think the purchase was well worth it with a combination of great visuals, extremely entertaining cast, and a healthy dose of in-your-face-action coupled with it being all presented in HD.  You literally get a lot of bang for your buck.  ;)  Don't knock Michael Bay until you see this action classic.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|Pros: I loved seeing a fresh young cast of relatively unknown actors instead of over-exposed, overplayed 'A or B-listers'. Kudos on the casting.    Cons: everything else    Other thoughts: If you think of this movie as 'Godzilla meets the Blair Witch Project', you'll have a fair idea of what to expect. Oh, and everyone dies. The end.
B00005JPFH|5.0|I thought this movie was awesome, being a huge spiderman fan starting from an early age. I thought this was one of the best spiderman's! Everyone gave it so many bad reviews, but thats bull! It was good and can't wait to see spiderman 4!
B000000WF9|5.0|Forget Gladiator; this is, by far, the best score ever written for any movie. No other score has so fully reflects the feelings running through  its film; this score not only accomplishes this to an astounding, even haunting, degree, but it also immeasurably deepens those feelings. In a way, each piece of this score seem to contain all human emotions simultaneously: it bleeds sorrow, it strengthens hope, it stirs anger, it both  tranquilizes and agitates. Listen for it and you will find it. This holism, this completeness, makes the music, as others have said, inexplicably haunting. But beyond emotions, this music will prompt you to think, as if ideas flicker subtly beneath the melodies and the harmonies: ideas about human potential, ambition, sacrifice, and strife.
B00005B36H|5.0|All of the Tool CDs are great each in their own way.  You have the experimental Opiate, hardcore thrashy Undertown, the back to experimental industrial Aenima and back to basics 10,000 days.  This one is a mush of all of those.  The lyrics of this CD are enough to make you think for days.  The guitar and drums are unbeatable and to top it off, this was Tool's first real try at good cover art.  Of course, 10,000 days won a Grammy for that artwork, but that's besides the point.  This is simply one of the greatest CDs...EVER
B000YABYLA|5.0|But you know what sometimes it happens and this movie captures the loving spirit that can be found in \\"kid\\" who knows she doesn't have all it takes to raise her baby. The premise of the movie may cross moral boundaries but you cannot deny the humor, and antics of Juno. I can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it, I even love the soundtrack, which I also purchased. Juno has a very EMO sense of humor and speaks way beyond her years sometimes but if you get her you'll get the movie and if not, YOUR A BUM!!! LOL!!
B000001DWG|5.0|I am a 90s kid, born in the early 80s.  I knew of Mother Love Bone but never listened to them.  Fast forward to....2003, I get Pearl Jam's DVD Live At The Garden and they do the song Crown of Thorns.  Then, I hear it on a couple of their bootlegs.  So, as curiosity goes, I find out who does that song.  I look at the back of my Singles Soundtrack and there it is.  So, i buy this CD because if a band is good enough for one great song, what stops them from having more.  This CD did nothing but amaze me.  I'm sooooo upset that Andy Wood couldn't have produced any more CDs other than Apple and Shine, but what he left behind were two of the greatest CDs in Seattle Grunge history.  This CD is a mush together of those two CDs and is just captivating.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Listening to this CD is the perfect way to keep the experience of actually going to see it live fresh in your mind. I loved seeing the musical and just listening to the music reminds me how much I loved it and makes me want to see it again. I say definitely get it if you have seen the show and if you just simply love Broadway music then it's a must have.
1580084621|5.0|I am absolutely crazy about Thai cooking. Tried to make several recipes before but it did not work out (used curry sources from a bottle). Bought \\"Thai food\\" after reading a very good review of a famous Dutch gourmet and restaurant reviewer. Cooked 3 recipes so far - absolutely brilliant. The best thing is that the author offers recipes for curry pastes for every (curry) dish. A bit time consuming but tastes as good as in a Thai restaurant. Recommend to all Thai cooking lovers.
0618918248|3.0|An ok effort from Dawkins. As an atheist, I found it somewhat ho-hum, and there are very few new arguments in this book.<br /><br />The book does, however, act as a decent reference book of the bulk of arguments from both sides.<br /><br />Dawkins does show a little bit of laziness here and after addressing a series of historical philosophical arguments for the existence of God, neglects fully the TAG (Transcendental argument for the existence of God), which is one of the more recent and well known arguments. In some ways, Dawkins points in the book line up and agree with the TAG, that is, where he says that we don't know we can trust our senses, or why the world makes sense.<br /><br />In the 1st chapter, he also makes a mistake in discussing a court case where a young boy wears an offensive t-shirt to school. After reading the court proceedings, I realized that Dawkins presented it in an unusual slant, and it has little to do with religion at all.<br /><br />Dawkins also mixes up \\"The Gospel of Thomas\\" with the so called \\"Infancy Gospel of Thomas\\", but I can't imagine that he cared that much, since he shows little respect for the bible and probably thinks that they are all about the same anyway.<br /><br />Other than that, the book is clearly written, well organized and progresses well with each chapter building on top of the previous chapters.<br /><br />While Dawkins may convince a few fence sitters, I don't think he will disturb many theists, who will view him as hostile immediately and probably stop listening. Dawkins has a difficult time sympathizing with a theistic reader and makes almost no effort to do any more than present a barrage of facts and sits there at the end and says \\"if you don't believe me, you're stupid\\".<br /><br />As I said, good as a reference, but not much more than that unless you are seeing ideas like this for the first time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Anybody that rated this show with 1, 2 or even 3 stars has serious ISSUES. I was hooked on this show right away. It's simply different. It doesn't take itself so seriously. I found myself laughing many times over the funny dialogue. The show has everything a good show should have: drama, humor, good looking people, romance and action. What else could anybody want? This series deserves another shot!
B000H0MKOC|4.0|\\"I just need to pay the mortgage.  Aside: The Yuppie Nuremberg Defense.\\"<br />  - Nick Naylor in Thank you for Smoking<br /><br />Because of a fellow reviewer's comment, I decided to watch THANK YOU FOR SMOKING.  Aaron Eckhart plays Nick Naylor who is a VP and \\"chief talking head\\" for the Academy of Tobacco Studies.<br /><br />The Academy is supposed to research the link between nicotine and cancer.  Who would have thought that they would never find any connection?<br /><br />Nick gets himself into trouble with his \\"flexible morals\\" and his errant lobbying ways; but never loses the support of his young son Joey,  played by Cameron Bright (despite what his ex wife calls his \\"dependency issues\\").<br /><br />This is a great satirical piece; it was based upon a novel by Christopher Buckley and was the first full feature film directed by Jason Reitman (of Juno fame).<br /><br />In terms of sensitivities, the film has little.  This is not an endorsement of the cigarette industry; but it still does present a callous view of the deep sufferings of many (all caused by nicotine).  If this does not hit close to home for you, the satire is well done and Naylor learns a lesson about the emancipation of those enslaved by nicotine himself in a not so presidential manner.<br /><br />Nick swaps horses; but doesn't seem to have lost any of his stripes by the end of the flick.  A very funny film about a not so funny addiction.<br /><br />Recommended: B+ (A biting satirical study)<br /><br />Bentley/2008<br />[[ASIN:B000H0MKOC Thank You for Smoking (Widescreen Edition)]][[ASIN:B000H0MKO2 Thank You for Smoking (Full Screen Edition)]]
B0015519VS|5.0|Not being a long time fan of Usher I was actually surprised how good this album was.  It's hard to believe that others actually gave his latest cd negative comments but I guess this is the comments of \\"kids\\".  This album shows both musical and personal growth.  It's obvious he is aimed at making \\"grown folks music\\" and not that \\"bubble gum\\" R&B music from his early career.  If you have appreciation for real R&B \\"grown folk music\\" you'll appreciate his latest work.
B0002KVULG|5.0|This is simply the best Dracula film ever made. Atmospheric, lavish, romantic gothic and erotic. There are other Dracula films that have charms of their own, but this brings a new and unique presentation to the classical theatrical Dracula. If you want fangs and gore, get a Hammer Films version.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|The Queen is indeed back...and better than ever! I friggin' love this album! Every song is tremendous. My absolute fave has to be 'Sand On My Feet' which is just plain beautifully sung. Donna's voice is stronger than ever (do not believe the haters) and she really rips loose on 'Fame (The Game)'. I cannot fathom why the 1-star reviews, it is just ridiculous. Donna wipes the floor with Mariah Carey!
B0016AJU2C|5.0|I just received this morning the new Alanis Morissette album FLAVORS OF ENTANGLEMENT, and the first thought I had while listening was: finally!  This \\"finally\\" is for 2 reasons: one is for the long, very long four years since her last, SOCALLED CHAOS, and the other one is for the album itself, which recaptures the impressive, amazing, weird sound of S.F.I.J, the album I consider Alanis best.  Some of the new songs (few I have to admit) I find average , or merely good, like Moratorium and dance-oriented Straitjacket, but the high points are really high, like the opener Citizen of the Planet, the emotives Not As We and Torch, the first single Underneath, or the agressive Versions of Violence.  This is the album one expects from Alanis Morissette (at least do I): great songs, great production, beautiful lyrics, full of heart.  FIVE STARS
B00065GX64|5.0|My feelings for this iconic piece of filmmaking mirror those I've previously expressed for David Lynch's masterpiece `Eraserhead'; namely that it exceeds the boundaries of perfection and thus defines the very word that is `film'.  There are very few films today that can even come close to capturing the brilliance that is captured within the frames that make up `M', a harrowing story about a murderer of children who manages to elude the police but finds himself in the angry hands of the criminal underground.  `M' (shortened from the original title `Eine Stadt Sucht Einen Morder' which translates to `The Murderers are Among Us') broke many boundaries and paved the way for the expressive filmmaking of today, but still it holds it's own as supremely better than most everything released today.<br /><br />`M' tells us the story of Hans Beckert and the misery and panic he spread throughout a small German city.  As children come up missing and or dead parents and concerned citizens alike find themselves in disarray as the police continue to search for this killer of children with no real success and or advancements.  As the police too begin to panic in their faulted efforts they begin to weigh heavy on the German community which has some adverse effects on the criminals controlling the underground.  These criminals come together to try and better their own situation which leads them to conclude that the only way they will get the police off of their backs is if they catch and put an end to this horror of a man once and for all.<br /><br />There are so many facets to this film that make it one of the grandest of all time.  It sets a perfect mood for the subject at hand, never once straying from that eerie and heart stopping vibe that permeates the screen.  The film flows magically from one scene to the next, never chopping and or losing our interest.  The rich black and white film and grainy atmosphere only add weight to the already weighty subtext; and then there is the sublime inclusion of the tune `In the Hall of the Mountain King', which is whistled by Beckert while he is on the prowl.  It is a simple detail, but that one detail is probably the most haunting facet to the entire film.<br /><br />And then, there is Peter Lorre.<br /><br />Peter Lorre has received much acclaim and attention for this gutsy role, tackling the first ever on screen serial killer, and rightfully so.  His fearless performance is one of the greatest of all time.  There is a scene where he is staring in the window of a toy store, watching a young girl in a mirror and his face bleeds forth with this wretched pain and confusion; utter torment eating away at his very soul.  He makes this man human, which was very gutsy especially at the time.  His final breakdown towards the end of the film where he tries to explain his horrible condition, his sickness if you will, is actually quite moving in his dire conviction and commitment to his performance.  It reminds me of the shivers one receives when witnessing Edward Norton's portrayal of Neo-Nazi Derek in `American History X'; a horrible man yet so convincing in his plight you wind up sympathizing with the Devil.<br /><br />`M' is not a film to be taken lightly.  There is so much power packed within this picture that one should be made aware of its affects on an individual.  `M' captures almost all too well the true extensive deteriorating powers of panic and fear.  As the general public begins to wear down with the police's inability to capture this murderer they begin to turn on one another, ready and willing to condemn any man who comes within speaking distance of a child.  The police likewise resort to rash and overzealous methods in order to uncover this murderer, feeling pressured by the innocent public merely trying to safeguard their offspring.  The criminals too feel compelled to take matters into their own hands in an effort to rid their town of its eternal distress and all of this culminates into a meldingpot of dread and misery.<br /><br />`M' may be hard to stomach at times.  No, this is not a graphic film but it is haunting in that it manages to strike at the heart of the audience, seeping into their soul.  The aftereffects are as distressing as those brought on by the recent `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' (`4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'); a film that brings out in us the human desire to correct all evils and save our loved ones from the exhausting touch of pain and suffering.  `M' is a film that finds itself in your heart and soul and wrecks havoc on your inner being; ultimately becoming a part of you and thus never leaving your side.  As many have noted, `M' is one of the greatest films ever filmed, and I too stand by that statement.<br /><br />In fact, it's quite possibly the best; possibly.hard to stomach at times.

B000002LQR|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive purchasing this album, thinking that funk music just wouldn't be my thing. But the beats are plain awesome thanks to some really great bass from Flea backed up by Chad's drums. Frusciante contributes absolutely incredible guitar playing along side Kiedis leading with spot-on vocals and lyrics as always. This is fun and easy listening at its best. Virtually perfect.
B0000C9JFO|1.0|A French film set in Barcelona, Spain; sounds beautifully intoxicating, right?  That's that I thought but sadly I was sorely mistaken.<br /><br />`L'Auberge Espagnole' (`The Spanish Apartment' / `Euro Pudding' depending on how you want to translate it) has the makings of an intricately woven coming of age story but it manages to be nothing more than a boring and tepid waste of time.  I remember when the opening credits for the film began to run and I thought to myself that this looked to be an extremely steamy sitcom, and I was put off a bit because I wanted to watch a `movie' and not a `sitcom' but I thought that if done right then it could prove to be a good time at least.  Instead I got something that doesn't even qualify as a `Dawson's Creek' style romp; a film that merely skims across the surface of stimulation and barely comes off as entertaining.  Even it's `film about nothing yet about so much more' approach is staggering and winds up being a film about nothing that is ultimately about nothing.<br /><br />I know I am in the minority here, but honestly, I can't bring myself to lie.<br /><br />I will say first and foremost that I adore films that seem to have no point but in the end touch us so deeply.  I'm all for that, but `L'Auberge Espagnole' is not that kind of film, at least not for me.  I gathered nothing from this experience, except shattered hopes and aspirations since the film wound up being so much less than I anticipated.  After seeing Audrey Tautou sizzle and score with the beautifully constructed `Amelie' I was dying to see her in action once again, so I picked up this film.  Sadly, Tautou is barely in this film, and even though she is decent in her small role she is still stunted by the scripts poor construction.<br /><br />The film follows Xavier, a French college student who decides to travel to Barcelona for a year to study economics and learn the Spanish culture in order to help secure himself a well paying job.  He leaves behind his difficult girlfriend and overbearing mother and winds up bunking with quite a few roommates all of different ethnic backgrounds (British, Italian, German, Danish, Spanish).  His girlfriend comes to visit, leaves upset, breaks up with him.  He falls for his lesbian roommate, then his friend's wife.  His roommate's brother comes to visit and turns everyone off (the only slightly entertaining segment in the film) and yet none of this seems remotely relevant since none of it is delivered in a way that makes us feel it is of the slightest importance.<br /><br />One good thing I can say about the film is that the entire cast handles their respective roles very well.  Their acting can't really elevate this film into the importance it is so actively seeking, but it does at least give me a singular avenue in which to praise.  Romain Duris is wonderful as Xavier, taking his characters shelter naivety and allowing him to blossom as the film lurches forward.  It's within the supporting characters that I found the most joy though.  Judith Godreche is especially stunning as Anne-Sophie, the married woman whom Xavier takes a liking to.  Cecile De France is also mesmerizing as Isabelle, Xavier's off-limits roommate, and Kelly Reilly makes her mark as the loud and outspoken Wendy.  I also really loved the inclusion of Kevin Bishop and his character William, for he actually held my interest for the brief moments he was on the screen.<br /><br />Sadly, they can't save this movie nor can they convince me to every watch it again or even suggest you give it a try.  I'd stay away from this film, but then again so many others here have praised it and recommended it and obviously seen something within its running time that I fail to see.<br /><br />To each his own, I always say; to each his own.mother and winds up bunking with quite a few roommates all of different ethnic backgrounds (British, Italian, German, Danish, Spanish).

B00000K3CR|5.0|The fact that I absolutely adore this movie comes as a huge shock to me since Tom Hanks is one of those actors I find completely overrated.  There are really only a handful of his films I can even attest to enjoying (`Cast Away', shockingly, as well as `Saving Private Ryan') but for the most part I find his work a tad overrated (ala `Forest Gump' and `Philadelphia').  `Big', of all of Hanks' work, is probably my favorite.  It is most definitely my favorite performance he's ever given and honestly this very performance may cause me to rethink everything I've already concluded about this Hollywood icon.<br /><br />Penny Marshal's extremely successful family hit `Big' tells the story of twelve-year-old Josh, a kid tired of being a kid who makes a hasty wish to be an adult and winds up getting exactly what he wished for, with mixed results.  Unable to explain what happened to him, Josh takes off from home until he can sort things out.  This leaves him alone and confused and his parents distraught and heartbroken.  Soon Josh starts to adjust, quite well at that.  He lands himself a high profile job, acquires a very nice apartment and ends up dating a beautiful coworker.<br /><br />While everything may seem to be going in the right direction, `Big' ever so delicately asks whether or not a normal childhood is worth giving up.<br /><br />The script is beautifully written; in such a way that one can't help but relate to the main characters and become a part of their story.  This is also hinged strongly on Hanks' masterful performance.  He really adapts the mannerisms and mental wavelength of a child of twelve and exhibits those characteristics perfectly.  He becomes Josh (thanks to some great method acting from what I hear) and thus sells us on a rather preposterous story.<br /><br />The rest of the cast also delivers strongly here, especially the likes of Elizabeth Perkins and Robert Loggia.  Perkins plays Josh's love interest Susan with ample amounts curiosity and admiration.  She becomes a believable woman, a believable lover.  Robert Loggia doesn't have a lot of screen time, but he is love for me here.  Seriously, his little piano-key dancing scene with Hanks is my favorite scene in the film, and the look on his face is that look of found boyishness that just exudes such presence.  John Heard nails the egotistical corporate climber as Paul, Josh's nemeses.

Probably her biggest hit (although I think I prefer `Awakenings') and one of her most widely acclaimed motion pictures, `Big' is truly one of a kind.  Hanks outdoes himself here and truly changes my perception of his career.on.  She becomes a believable woman, a believable lover.  Robert Loggia doesn't have a lot of screen time, but he is love for me here.  Seriously, his little piano-key dancing scene with Hanks is my favorite scene in the film, and the look on his face is that look of found boyishness that just exudes such presence.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|Since the actual music seems already to have been discussed to death here, all I can really say is, put it on and just enjoy it ... and if it takes you somewhere go along. Other than that,  the Deluxe edition of Seventh Tree is definitely worth buying over the standard CD, maybe for the little lyrics booklet included alone, with the DVD and poster making it all the better, not to mention the good-quality box it all comes in. Especially if you're already a Goldfrapp fan.

0786838655|5.0|This is a fast moving and very entertaining book in the \\"fantasy exists in the modern world\\" genre.  However, as pointed out by others it is VERY similar to the Potter series - a young man with no parents (in this case, he's raised with no father) who finds out he has a special background and magical powers, leaves home to get special education at a secret magical institution, has a male and a female friend, finds out he's \\"special\\" even in his new world, etc.  Like Potter, the story is framed by the school year except it inverses the timing - in this case Percy leaves home to go to a magical SUMMER CAMP and RETURNS for the school year.  At any rate Riordan's writing style is very different from Rowlings and includes much more humor (Hades rant about the costs of maintaining the Underworld is a scream: \\"Don't get me started on Chadron!  He's been impossible ever since he discovered Italian suits!\\").  The book is more lightweight than HP but in all honesty I believe it is better written and frankly more entertaining, and I definitely recommend it.
B0017I1FNK|4.0|i think this is a excellent CD! it is back to great harmonies emmylou  and dolly parton have always sounded perfect together. i also like the  way this CD  sounds the sound is so clear and the acoustic's are very  good. although there are no country rockers on this CD i still think it  is emmylou getting back to her basic's and her voice sounds just as good  as i have always loved it.
B0015I2P0Y|4.0|Elbow's \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" truly gets better with every listening.  The music's indie mix of synthesized keyboard tempered by bluesy guitar complements the soulful voices of lead singer Guy Garvey and the rest of the band.  Pink Floyd seems to be a definite influence, especially in \\"The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver\\" and \\"An Audience with the Pope,\\" but don't think for a minute that Elbow's sound is derivative.  \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" exudes originality on every track.<br /><br />There's not a single song I dislike on this CD, although I have my favorites:  \\"Grounds for Divorce,\\" \\"The Bones of You,\\" \\"An Audience with the Pope,\\" and \\"On a Day Like This.\\"  The instrumental texture varies from track to track, from the percussion and synthesizer-driven \\"The Fix\\" (which sounds like it might belong in a contemporary musical) to the orchestration of \\"On a Day Like This\\" to New Age-sounding opening notes to \\"The Starling\\"  to the acoustical guitar and piano of \\"Friend of Ours.\\"  The unifying factor is Garvey's pure voice that never dominates; he sings as though he is another one of the instruments.  The band has dedicated this CD, in particular the song \\"Friend of Ours,\\" to a friend who passed away, and their affection and longing comes through, even on some of the more upbeat songs.<br /><br />I have listened to \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" a dozen times, and each time I like something else about it.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates indie/alternative rock with a clean, yet complex sound.
B0015UXNIU|2.0|Firstly, let me state that I did NOT finish this book.  The reason being is that after reading all the hype surrounding this book, I had high expectations of the humour and writing.....and after trying to read around 4-5 chapters, I found myself not agreeing with the hype.   Maybe if all the chapters had flowed as one continuous story it may have held my attention more.   I just couldn't get into the whole story despite desperately wanting to enjoy this.   And I didn't find it as funny as everyone else had spoken about, so this compounded my exasperation with this book.   Maybe I will come back to it another time, when really desperate.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Beowulf uses the same style of motion-capture animation that Director Robert Zemeckis employed in The Polar Express. The film is based upon the epic Saxon poem, written around the 8th century. While it has become a national treasure in England, its setting and characters are actually Scandinavian. The film is only loosely based on the poem although I doubt there are many who have read the epic, as it's a bit of a laborious read, even with a modern translation.<br /><br />The film opens in Heorot, the great hall of Danish King Hrothgar. The aged, rotund King (Hopkins) and his men are celebrating a victory in battle. Hrothgar stumbles about drunkenly, and near naked. His men sing the praises of their King but their exuberance is interrupted by the arrival of the monster Grendel who literally crashes the party, killing nearly everyone on the hall yet strangely unwilling to fight Hrothgar, even when challenged. The King offers half his fortune to any man who can kill Grendel but none who venture to haunted moors where the beast lives, ever return.<br /><br />The legendary hero Beowulf (Winstone) arrives with a company of his soldiers and promises to slay the giant. He is not all bravado as he succeeds in his task but is faced with the even more daunting task of slaying Grendel's unnamed mother (Jolie).<br /><br />The first impression of Beowulf's character in the film is that he is, frankly, a bit of a prick. He's arrogant and prideful, and loves to boast about his deeds. He's not above hitting on Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) even when the King is nearby. He even lies through his teeth about killing Grendel's mother although the King sees through the lie and knows what truly happen when the hero encountered the demonic she-creature. Ultimately though, Beowulf does redeem himself. With Hrothgar having no heir, he proclaims that Beowulf will be the new King upon his death. Many years later, an aged Beowulf must be the hero one more time to rescue his kingdom from a fire-breathing dragon, the latest offspring of Grendel's mother.<br /><br />The motion-capture in Beowulf is leagues ahead of Polar Express.  While Express was a fantasy and could be excused for a lot of whimsy, this film had to go for a grittier, more realistic look.  Everything from the character's movements and facial expressions to the lighting and shadows, and depth of texturing was breathtaking.  In particular, the Grendel character was perhaps the most intriguing.  He is a broken, twisted, and deformed monster.  Every moment of his pitiful life is painful.  Even the mirthful singing of Hrothgar's men was torment to his ears.  Crispin Glover plays the role of Grendel with spastic ingenuity.  Jolie was just creepy no matter how #D animated naked she happened to be...Hopkins seemed to relish his role King, gleefully prancing about in the opening scenes much to the embarrassment of his Queen.  Brendan Gleeson also stood out as Beowulf's second-in-command, Wilglaf.  The fine Irish character actor always brings a strong presence to every performance.<br /><br />Certain liberties were taken with the script.  In the original tale Beowulf returns to his homeland where he becomes King as opposed to taking Hrothgar's crown.  As pointed out in one of the featurettes, this was done to forward the continuity of the film.  And while I understand that a film does need conflict and all, I just didn't like the attempt to make Beowulf a flawed hero.<br /><br />It's not a perfect, or even great film.  There's not a lot of time expended in developing characters, particularly Grendel's mother who we learn almost nothing about.  It's an exciting film, bloodier than one may think and visually arresting.  While the motion-capture process will never replace actual live film, in moderation and with the right material, they can be first-rate entertainment.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian's come up with a great one!!! The workouts on this DVD are soooo much harder than you think they will be. I have been using this DVD (although not exclusively) for about a month and have \\"pretty much\\" mastered Levels 1 & 2 and did Level 3 the other day- it was INSANE. Whew. I am so happy to have found workouts I can do that are just 27 minutes (including warmup & cooldown). I have found that I WILL workout when its only 27 min. If I had to do an hour workout everyday, I would probably start making excuses...you know how that goes! Also, using Shred has increased my endurance with my other workout DVDs, which is great!
B00005YUNY|5.0|With the unsettling news that the Yes tour for Summer 2008 has been cancelled due to Jon's declining health, recorded Yes concerts will be all that we have for now, and fearfully, forever.    Fortunately, this and other Yes concerts have been preserved in an extraordinary fashion. This concert captures Yes, late in their touring career and shows what geniuses they are. The music is superb, the set list is a cross section of their music from the early 70s until now and it is all enhanced by having the orchestra back them up. Chris and Steve play incredibly and provide the backdrop for Jon to display his unbelievable creativity and vocal talent.    Take care of yourself and get well soon Jon and bestow upon your fans the biggest gift you can...your good health.    Todd Edlin  Atlanta, GA
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|This is my first review on Amazon. Becuase I found this movie to be a complete disspointment is why I decided to write a review. My review is based soley off of this movie as based off of the original book and not historical accuracy. When this movie first came out in the theatres I was excited to see it becuase I had heard that the book was excellent. Becuase I am one of those people that absolutely must read the book before the movie I read the book just a few months ago knowing that the DVD was going to come out. I found all 661 pages of the book to be very engaging and entertaining. Although the characters were all 'grown up' from the beginning of book, the author established the characters throughtout the events and timeline of the book. You knew who the characters were and what their qualities and behavior were like. This movie did not establish these characters at all nor establish the relationship each sibling, George, Anne and Mary had with one another. I also was dissappointed in the script for Henry. I thought Bana did the best he could with what was given to him which was a lot of fancy costumes and not enough dialogue. However, and I must mention this, in the book, Henry did not rape Anne. I'm not sure why they put that in the movie. There were many mini-plots throughout the book that weren't even touched in the movie at all. According to the book, Mary's first child was Catherine, not Henry. Furhtermore, Anne was absolutely horrible to her sister Mary in the book. Maybe one thing the movie maybe sort of got right was that dispite how horrible Anne was to her sister, Mary was always loyal to her. But how this movie depicted their mother as someone who cared and loved for her daughters was all wrong. She was a cold business women in the book. There are too many inconsistancies between the book and movie to go on. But from one book and movie lover to another, I found myself completely dissappointed last night when I had finished the movie. If you haven'tread the book, read it. Don't watch the movie.

B00000F169|5.0|Four seventies style burn outs roam the galaxy in what seems like a weaponized version of a Volkswagen bus searching for unstable planets. Their government mission to destroy these planets with the help of a HAL style computer (undoubtedly running MS) and artificially intelligent bombs.     Anyone remembering the cartoon Colonel Bleep might appreciate Dark Star for the same reason Frank Zappa might have enjoyed it... cheepnis. Dark Star drips cheepnis from the special effects to the choice of monster (pet actually).     The attitude taken by every facet of artificial intelligence (you can't have self realization without attitude) is similar to that of bureaucrats throughout the centuries and typical of today's corpopath. It's very difficult to argue with artificial intelligence as anyone ever having dealt with a government employee can tell you. When you're in space no one can hear you scream... or curse. Easily as disorganized and unaccountable (even to itself) as any 'official' operation Dark Star's mission should be a belly laugh for anyone ever having to argue with an automatic banking machine for their money or otherwise discuss reality with an electronic entity.    The biological intelligences consist of:    Boder - disinterested, self obsessed Texan style narcissist  Pinback - insecure and friendless, overweight, neurotic, arrested adolescent  Doolittle - lieutenant leader who spends time reminiscing his surfing day in Malibu  Talby - reclusive, philosophical observations/navigational officer   pet alien - mischievous beach ball with claws    The discussion with the smart bomb regarding Phenomenology is priceless.    \\"What is the one purpose in life?\\"    \\"To explode of course!\\"    If computers and artificial intelligence ever discover religion and decide to become born again we're in very serious trouble.
B0002W4SWC|1.0|I picked this up because I heard that it was a modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice, that all-time favourite of women who can read English. Compare this to the BBC production of that Jane Austen gem [[ASIN:6305078564 Pride and Prejudice (A&E, 1996)]] which stars Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth (who also plays Darcy here) and ask yourself who the more dignified, broad-minded and liberated woman is - Bridget Jones or Elizabeth Bennett?    Elizabeth Bennett lived at a time when very few women could even think of independence and economic self-sufficiency. Poor, unmarried women had to live as dependents and \\"poor relations\\", basically unpaid, if well-kept, servants. Yet, Ms. Bennett refuses to marry a man whom she cannot respect and turns down another suitor because his proposal is insulting and demeaning. She has pride and self-respect.    Compare this lady with a \\"modern\\" woman who has a job and life of her own, but considers herself a failure when she can't get a date? Despite all her disadvantages, Elizabeth Bennett shines as a far more \\"modern\\" woman than Bridget Jones.    I feel sorry that such excellent actors waste their talent on this trashy  re-make of a great novel.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I have very mixed feelings about this movie.  Yes, the costumes were outstanding, I even think that the actor who portrayed Henry did a fairly decent job (and a very good looking younger Henry he made, too).  I do not really care for Natalie or Scarlet in particular, but they didn't do all that bad of a job, considering the script they had to work with.  I love all things Tudor, so I was disappointed, again, to find that known truths were toyed with and manipulated.  Mary did not take Elizabeth (a very young Elizabeth, actually...I believe Elizabeth would have been a bit older when her mother was beheaded, maybe 3ish?) from court and raise her with her children as was implied in the end of the film...perhaps she visited from time to time, but she was not whisked away by her Aunt. She had her own household, and was away from court much of the time during her younger years.  I also do not believe that Henry forced himself on Ann, I have read many books on both Henry and his family and I do not recall ever reading any such thing.  I believe he was frustrated with her and may have been angry at feeling manipulated, and also I believe that they did eventually have relations before their marriage, but he didn't rape her.  However, I can say something positive...they did a great job with the sex scenes...barely any skin shown and the \\"rape\\" scene was a mild as you can get.  The rape scene in Rob Roy is far more graphic and upsetting.  Kudos for handling these scenes with some class.  But, all in all, only three stars because I dislike when people twist and turn facts to suit their needs.  Things happened as they happened, and I'm not sure if Henry were able to attend the opening of The Other Boleyn Girl, that he would have been pleased at the final product.  So, I stand with Henry, and I'm somewhat dissatisfied.
B000MXPE74|3.0|I like several songs on this CD--some are a bit \\"wild\\" or \\"overdone\\" for my taste.  It took over a year since I first heard \\"Whistle For the Choir\\" before I was able to find it.

Now his story and that of his friends is told with clarity in order to compel this generation to live with passion and truth. One man or woman can make a difference. The road is hard and long. It is a costly journey. Bringing little-known facts to light, the film-makers bring a true hero to life. This is the kind of entertainment that changes a culture, calling us to reach out to Grace.
B00000JZC4|5.0|This record starts out with 5 of the best songs I've ever heard. The raw emotion and honesty of the singing combined with the masterful guitar riffs and grooves is a mix that never wears out for me. Richard was at the top of his game when he made this and he really had some moments of divine inspiration.  To this day when Filter plays live, half of their set is draws from this record. If you are in a f-ed up relationship this is the album that you need to listen to.
B00005MP58|5.0|There is no other production of this story so authentic and enchanting as this one with these stars. I watch this movie several times a year. It transports me to a time and place I love and the way Colin and Jennifer interact with each other is so believable that you honestly feel the tranformation of their affections.  His facial expressions of frustration, pain, pleasure and adoration of being in her company need no dialogue and her responses are equally passionate and honest. Every one of the supporting actors are perfectly cast.

Would be great to see them bring back his clone in upcoming shows. He had his moves downpat. A younger version and yet different. Buy this movie if you can - definitely a rewatch several times.  Cannot wait for the next one. I hope there are a ton of movies to follow.. We know it is so demanding of the stars, but we love ya all so much. You do such a great job.

B000R8YC18|4.0|Martin Scorsese, the writer/director of the Taxi Driver, has admitted that this film is the cathartic result of a bevy of dark thoughts that surrounded his mind during a very low period of his life. By the time the credits finally make their merciful way on screen, we can see exactly what Scorsese saw during those days and the residual effect it has on us, the viewers, will likely stay hauntingly familiar long after we have watched the conclusion of this film.<br /><br />PLOT:<br /><br />Tavis Bickle, a taxi driver and volunteer for a New York City political campaign, has tried it all. He's attempted doing things the right way, treating people with kindness and women with respect. Nevertheless, he is ignored and his chivalrous advances continually stepped upon or altogether discarded by one person after another. It is when Tavis realizes that he will forever be average and overlooked that he decides to make drastic changes in his world. Almost at once he begins driving the most dangerous portions of New York in his taxi, scouring the nighttime landscape with his mind cultivating a solution to his own personal, dark problems. Soon, his decision becomes conclusive: he will become a vigilante, and his first offering to the world will be in aiding a young teenaged prostitute by providing her a way out, no matter what it may cost Tavis personally in the process.<br /><br />Perhaps Scorsese's most poignant film, The Taxi Driver offers a bleak, but somehow refreshing, alternative to the concept of \\"taking it lying down.\\" Here, in his vision, there is another solution, and one in which while many of us fantasize about, almost all of us refuse to make a reality.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5

B000066744|3.0|Three times now I've watched this movie on afternoons when I just wanted to unwind a bit and be entertained by something that lacked violence, gratuitous nudity, and over-the-top flights of nonsensical language. The Legend of 1900 offers an interesting take on the supposed life of a piano prodigy who is born upon a ship and never ventures to dry land his entire life. It is, in many ways, an offering of what life can be for those who view it through a simple perspective, and the burden that comes with broadening our experiences.
B00026WU7I|5.0|This album represents the very best of Bob's mid-career output. Aaron, the eight-year-old rock critic, says that you can tell how Mr Dylan is feeling by listening to his songs. Bob was sad, he observes. He adds that Mr Dylan tells stories in his songs, and that his characters talk. I think this is very astute and an accurate description of this album. Bob sings gently and sadly on this musically beautiful record. Sweet tunes, beautiful guitar work and the incisive harmonica in the correct proportions. I must add, though, that from an adult perspective Mr Dylan in this album is feeling really sad and angry and conflicted about the death of love, and that he is characterizing his hurt and confusion in a way that makes me think of a long slow painful death of a piece of the soul, just like a stroke. And no matter how much rehabilitation occurs one is always left with some limited use that never fully recovers. I love this album but it is cold and painful to listen to the ache. Unfortunately, the tunes are positively catchy and you find yourself whistling along to a song describing wrenching loneliness. Oh Bob. I am so sorry.
0143038583|4.0|For years I've have medical problems that could only be atributable to some rather bizarre genetic predalictions or to something in my diet as yet undefinable. After years of searching, and diligently keeping my food diary with the help of elimination diets, I've finally figured out what was making me ill --- industrialized food!! At that point, I started absorbing everything on the topic that I could get my hands on... including \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" by Michael Pollan.    Pollan takes us through a journey of discovery with one of the most critical necessities of life... food. While, at times, he waxes a little poetic and throws in an unnecessary $25 word or two, he does an admirable job illustrating and contrasting the social, political, environmental and nutritional aspects of industrial agriculture, large-scale and local-scale organic agriculture, and hunting-gathering.     I'm glad to have read this book, even if parts of it are eerily remniscent of other such books and articles on the topics. It shows me that I am not the only person concerned with the quality of our food system and the inherent drawbacks of industrialization in an otherwise natural process. After reading this book, one will never again be able to just \\"pick something up\\" at a fast food restaurant or supermarket and not realize the impacts those choices have on themselves and the world around them. Ignorance is only bliss in that it reduces such moral dilemma's - in the end, it really could kill you (or at least, make you very ill). This book doesn't allow you the self-destructive freedom of such ignorance when it comes to the food you eat or where/who you buy it from.
B0000C8AW2|4.0|What a difference thirty years makes. Even among Dylan's hard core base the release of Street Legal in 1978 was greeted with all the mock enthusiasm of his own \\"one hand clapping.\\" Among the more printable critiques at the time were - \\"muddy\\", \\"self-indulgent\\" and \\"painfully uneven.\\" Dylan has never been all that concerned about hiring competent producers (himself or others) and Don Devito's below sea level technical efforts left most listeners channeling Jacques Crousteau. After a few tortured plays my vinyl copy soon found its way into well deserved oblivion.    Fortunately by way of a friend, a re-mastered copy found its way to my door a few weeks ago and difference is startling. While the sound is by no means audiophile pure, considering the original train wreck, it is now possible to glean human language from the vocals and to fully appreciate some of Dylan's best allegorical songwriting. The five-song sequence on what was originally side two - \\"Is Your Love In Vain\\" through \\"Where Are You Tonight?\\" - is really tightly choreographed and contains some of his most personal meditations on the regret of love squandered, redeemed and squandered again. Very powerful.    Street Legal is certainly not Dylan's best but well worth the listen (unless I change my mind again in 2038.)
B000Y7U98C|3.0|this is not a great movie.<br /><br />there is no character development and the plot really goes sour near the end. it schizophrenically changes from basic science fiction to a pseudo-spiritual horror flick with a chaser of philosophy. it's all very try hard : like the director wanted to make two movies.... striving for Stanley Kubrick and John Carpenter at the same time. pretty tall order.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there is one overwhelmingly successful aspect to this film.<br /><br />have you ever stood on a high cliff (or anywhere high and scenic) and felt the irresistible urge to jump off and fly away ? in the back of your mind you know, of course, what will happen to you...but...there is that CALLING.<br />this film captures that feeling perfectly. the visuals of the sun and its glorious power are astoundingly attractive and that feeling comes through the characters over and over.<br /><br />i have often stood, simply humbled by the idea that you cannot look directly at it even when you are 93 million miles away. if you are a stargazer, daydreamer, or just a person like me who is amazed at the universe around you.....you'll like this one.<br /><br />mind you, this is not a religious or spiritual film. in fact, science is equated to rationality and it wins out over mysticism here. and while i do not profess to know if THAT is true, it is easy for me to see why our ancestors worshipped the sun. they were right. the sun, like each one of us, was born and it will die. however, unlike our world, where everything alive is interdependent, the sun is not. we depend upon it completely but it does not need us.<br /><br />the message of this film is that you are not really in control....<br />and sunshine is greater than we are.

One of my very first concerts was headlined by Webb Pierce and Faron Young, and introduced a youngster named \\"Elvis Presley.\\"  I have seen Porter and Dolly at Mockingbird State Park in Brown County, Indiana, and have watched Tammy and George (when they were married), as well as Johnny Cash, June, the Statler Brothers, and Carl Perkins, in Kansas City, Kansas.  I have seen Merle Haggard in Columbia, Missouri and Charleston, South Carolina, and Emmylou in Asheville, North Carolina.  Just hearing Emmylou sing Merle's \\"Kern River\\" is worth the price of admission for this CD, but there are so many other rewards.  Any one out there who would rate this CD as less than a \\"5,\\" is caught up in what we \\"English majors\\" would describe as \\"intellectual masturabation,\\" or, what those in Chaucer's times would refer to as \\"fustian.\\"  This is a wonderful CD!
B00005RYKU|2.0|\\"Run of the mill\\" was a term I kept thinking while watching THE GLASS HOUSE.  By the time it reaches its CAPE FEAR finale (where the villain appears to survive everything to remain a threat), I'd lost interest in the story--mainly because the characters weren't very interesting to begin with.<br /><br />Leelee Sobieski is a hot teen girl.  She looks great in a bikini, looks great standing around, just looks great.  But there's really nothing to her character to distinguish her from any other teenage girl.  She's sympathetic because she's...hot.  (She's certainly not very good at eavesdropping since she gets caught every single time).<br /><br />You know what might have made this movie more interesting?  Leelee actually begins to have feelings for her new guardian, Stellan Skarsgard.  He charms her, pulls her in, draws her out of her depression over the death of her parents (imagine the betrayal that sets up!).  But his character is so slimy and creepy that I'm surprised he wasn't wearing a hockey mask or even a black stovepipe hat with a black moustache from his first scene.  Everything is so undeveloped and by-the-numbers that nothing is a surprise.<br /><br />Diane Lane and Bruce Dern are around but the movie wastes their considerable talents.<br /><br />When it's over, you're left with...okay...that's it, huh?
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Great Battery.  Got it for my Canon 20D.  Used for a wedding this past week in North Carolina where I took over 1000 pictures (preceremony, formals and ceremony) before changing it out.  Battery meter still showed full charge but I thought it best to change before shooting the reception events.
B0002B15XI|5.0|In addition to the video being a hit, the seller was quick to send the video and the shippment went great!
B000654YRY|5.0|This is great guitar and band rock and roll at its best. The venue is a large outdoor stadium that is packed. I did not have any problem with the 2.o sound, it was just as good as 5.1 surround sound to me. I give this one a five star rating even thought it does not have Sultans of Swing. The other songs especially Heavy Fuel more than make up for this. This is an excellent concert DVD well worth the purchase.
B000MGUZKM|5.0|I don't know why I slept on this like I did. I didn't even listen to it all the way before I rated it because I KNEW it was sweet music, and I knew that because I know Randy & I know Joe (LOL!) They can do no wrong when they get together. I like the update on Rio de Janiero Blue & Danceland - almost the same, but not - fresher, maybe? But Beautiful, Tell Me More & More and then Some, Everybody's Talking (a nod to Harry Nilsson), Save Your Love, & All Night Long will make your hair stand straight up. Randy's older voice is  lush and rich & does not disappoint. This CD is a must-have to any collection.. if you like good music, that is.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My DVD, The 30 Day Shred: Lose Up To 20 pounds In 30 Days, by Jillian Micheals arrived last week. Tonight was my first attempt at the work out. All I can say is \\"HOLY COW! What a work out.\\" Very intense and for people who live sedentary lifestyles like me, it definitely makes you sweat. I smelled like a pig when I was done but I also felt very good. The work out was challenging for me but very, very doable. When my legs were ready to give out, it was time to switch moves so that helped a lot. It has 3 levels of intensity. I honestly didn't think I was going to make it through the entire 20 minute work out but I did.<br /><br />What differentiates this workout video from the others I've tried is that you start to sweat almost immediately after the warm ups. I'm beginning to think the other workout videos I own are more for conditioning and less for actual weight loss as I rarely, if ever sweated--even though I found a few of them a bit challenging. Oh, and that's another thing. This video is not challenging in the way of choreography, it's challenging in the way of how out of shape you are or aren't.<br /><br />I'm on level one. I plan to be here for a good 2 to 3 weeks. I figure with my hip problems that should give my body enough time to adjust to working out and then I can see if I'm ready for level 2. I'll be real curious to see how much weight I lose. And I'll be cheating a little, too. I want to throw in a walking video each day or perhaps Richard Simmon's Sweatin' To The Oldies.
B0013LKZWS|3.0|Well...  I guess my title says it all...    I instantly detected the Fiona Apple heavy piano chords  and general style    The only thing is, which is a problem for me personally, she is wayy more happy than Fiona...    I recommend this album, but if you are a huge Fiona Apple fan like me,  it would be hard to avoid the comparison between the two.    And, as all trainees are - she needs to keep on training.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|There isn't much else I can add to the 250+ outstanding reviews on Amazon regarding North and South.  I borrowed this DVD set from my local library and watched all four episodes in one sitting.  I loved everything about it.  The acting is fantastic--Richard Armitage took my breath away but Daniele Denby-Ashe, Brendan Coyle, Sinead Cusack and others are wonderful as well.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the writing, direction, and music are excellent.  I ended up buying North and South, but then soon after gave it to my mother (who enjoys it just as much as I do) and now I need to buy another copy.
B00007E8UG|4.0|\\"When I Look in Your Eyes,\\" by Canadian born jazz singer/pianist Diana Krall was released in 1999, with underlying orchestral arrangements by noted jazz composer/arranger Johnny Mandel.  Krall recalls that, in her first conversation with Mandel, she told him that she was both a singer and a pianist.  Mandel replied,\\" Oh, so you're a hyphenate!  Are you a singer-pianist or a pianist-singer?\\" The singer then confirms that her favorite singers have all played piano too: she lists Dinah Washington, Roberta Flack, Shirley Horn, Fats Waller, Andy Bay, and \\"especially\\" Carmen McRae: \\"ultimately\\" Nat King Cole.<br /><br />Krall, who was granted a scholarship to the prestigious Boston Berklee College of Music, and is married to British singer Elvis Costello, won a Grammy for 1999 Jazz Vocalist of the year for the album, for which she also received an Album of the Year nomination.  She knows how to swing a song; gives a song its emotional due, and demonstrates a true feeling for jazz.  She can be bluesy when called for, or painterly on a ballad, and, very importantly, she tends to know what the lyrics are about.  \\"When\\" is a compilation of some of the greatest items in the American Songbook.\\"Let's Face the Music and Dance,\\" a late, intense song by George Gershwin, gets outstanding treatment, as does the title song, and Cole Porter's \\"I've Got You under My Skin,\\" a signature of Frank Sinatra's.  \\"I Can't Give You Anything but Love,\\" and \\"Let's Fall in Love,\\"are smooth and soothing as your favorite bartender's martini.<br /><br />From overhead elevator conversation, I've gathered that many people prefer [[ASIN:B00006J9OT Live in Paris]],(2002), her first live concert release, as they find it swings more, but \\"When\\" is surely a nice record to have around the house, when you're in the mood.  This particular version of it is in SACD; that's enhanced sound, if, lucky you, you've got the equipment it calls for.
B0000041CZ|3.0|This recording of the Well Tempered Clavier is a good enough place to start, especially for someone just getting into Bach.  I find that some of my favorite fugues (F#, Eb minor) feel stiff, robotic even.  While some reviewers have praised the recording for it's clarity, and the ability to hear the counterpoint, I disagree - the sense of line and melody is almost completely lost, as is even the basic rhythmic thrust in the Eb minor.  It sounds like someone is playing the fugue as chords, vertically, rather than as melodies with interplay.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Whatever happened to Gilmore Girls in later seasons? I don't know. But whatever did was NOT a problem in Season 1. If you're thinking of giving the show a chance because you've heard so much about it, go ahead! Jump, take the dive, it's perfectly safe.    Season 1 is the story of the Gilmore family, Lorelai and Rory, mother and daughter, and all the people they include daily in their lives. Wether by blood or by experience, the Gilmore family is a big and fun one.    Season 1 deals with how Lorelai and Rory got to that point in their lives. It deals with Rory growing up, having her first boyfriend; with Lorelai slowly coming to terms with her parents and her expectations for her daughter and their world.    The Gilmore girls are not perfect, but they're charming and quite interesting. One of the highlights of the season is Rory's developing relationship with Dean Forester. I think Dean is usually underrated, but to me, he was Rory's best boyfriend and in this season, while they're still so young, they're still a romantic and warm couple.    There are little DVD extras and the ones included are not exactly riveting or revealing. I would have loved a few commentaries and a gag reel, but you buy this set for the episodes, because they're wonderful.     It is a beautiful season. It is a beautiful show.
B000P12LWY|4.0|This past March I was faced with a minor dilemma as all of my favorite TV shows had come to an end. When The Wire ended its run, it finalized the trio of my favorite shows which included Six Feet Under and The Sopranos. My other favorite shows such as 24 are either past their prime (praying for a rebound season 7) or the consistently great show The Shield is ending its run this fall. That said, I'm looking for something new to watch and The Tudors was recommended to me by a very close friend. Despite my initial cynicism I had toward this show, I gradually became more and more interested and involved. In this reviewers opinion, The Tudors will never be as good as my beloved New Jersey mob family; however, it is still a compelling drama that contains the elements that made other personal favorites of mine great. Despite the historical inaccuracies this show portrays it does make the very intriguing life of Henry VIII even more appealing to a wider audience that may not appreciate history as much as myself or others may. The real lives of those in the Tudor dynasty are much more compelling then those in this television show. If one wants to have a more accurate depiction of Henry VIII you should be reading a book or watching a PBS documentary instead of this show. As a lifelong student of history this show sparked interest within me to research further into what I already knew about the lives of Henry VIII, his six wives and VERY IMPORTANT children, Cardinal Wolsey, etc. All of this said, The Tudors is a very solid drama and in the wake of great shows such as The Wire, Six Feet Under, the soon to be over The Shield, and The Sopranos this show is very decent on its own ground. Showtime is slowly overtaking HBO as the premier cable network due to the fact that they have very interesting and well-priced TV shows such as Dexter, Weeds, Californication, and of course this show. I am anxiously awaiting the release of season two of The Tudors on DVD as it is one of my new favorite shows.orite shows.
0596101996|5.0|I feel that this book is really a work of art. Besides agreeing with the last reviewer that it is not fair to consider this as a book for beginners and then judge it against that standard, I'd say that even though it is not for beginners, it does not make unnecessary arcane references, etc. It is very readable, at least for someone who's had a little experience working with JavaScript. I'd say it is not even a requirement to know object oriented principles (except for those sections perhaps). The author has not only made intelligible so many of the quirks of JavaScript, but provides code which is easy to follow yet extremely useful.     As far as examples, while for JavaScript fans, it might have been nice that the book expanded into 2000 pages instead of almost 1000 that it is now, the author does, I feel, what is necessary to both explain and demonstrate the concepts, and most often, does so by creating VERY useful utility functions and \\"classes\\". Just for the utility functions alone, the book would be worth it, really. There are only a very few places where the author suggests to look elsewhere, and besides my not minding doing so given how the book already saved me so much time, the cited references would have taken up unnecessary space if the author were to include them (and they definitely weren't essential).    The book is not outdated! Unlike other books, most of the book is rarely tied down to code that can become outdated as browsers change (like the changeable but helpful quirksmode.org ). Of course, as a big fan of this book, I hope the author will be persuaded to keep making new editions (and make a hardcover!). If you really want to learn the language, this is THE book.    This book was no doubt an immense labor of love--you can feel the author is human, actually teaching, and is not trying to show off with terminology while he still does explain a  whole lot of necessary terms, etc., comments the code well, etc. As with art (not the strange modern variety either), I am flabbergasted some people cannot appreciate its beauty. In a complex JavaScript application, I am building, I am using no less than 7 of the utility classes he provided in the book.    For those studying JavaScript in depth / reading this book, I'd recommend one supplement to the book: the informative articles at [...] (and no doubt that author's book too). The articles on private members and classical vs. prototypal inheritance are one area I felt for which additional examples and use of terminology was helpful, and allowed me to appreciate and understand the chapter in the book on classes more fully (and utilize the approaches in its utility classes as well).
B0014Z4ON4|1.0|I saw this when it came out (I was a young adult.)  As someone from a hindu family (I am an atheist), I was revolted by the overt insulting nature of this film towards Indians and Hindus.

0452289963|5.0|One way to judge whether teachings, such as in this book, have merit, is to note whether the reader's behavior changes as a result. In this case, mine has. I'm less reactive to events, I'm less threatened by others' comments, I'm more relaxed, I'm less controlling, and I spend more time in the present moment. These are palpable benefits for me, my family, and acquaintances.
B000002I4W|5.0|I think a lynching (at least verbal) would be appropriate for the people who said he should be burned and destroyed for messing with the precious jazz formula.  I think the risks Ornette Coleman took are VERY appropriate.  Besides, unpredictability can be fun, and Ornette Coleman demonstrates this with glee.  He does know too much is just _________ annoying and it doesn't sound daring or challenging, it just sounds bad, or _____.  Unlike his most famous album (maybe, Free jazz, there isn't two seperate quartets for each channel.  There are also only four members.  The sound is very clean on this album, but there is a sense of adventure on this album.<br /><br />Whenever I listen to it, there's always something to listen to.  This is one of those albums like that, but this album really is just FUN.  Now, introspection is awesome.  But I appreciate music on pretty much all of it's fronts, those deep meanings, those messages, the dancing, or just plain on listening how people use their voices as instruments.  Such as this.  Don Cherry and Ornette Coleman do that, but they really just seem to have fun.  The drums and bass are focused and run like the wind. Only in Lonely and Lonely Women are they toned down to beauty and melancholy, respectfully.  The rest just rip, glide, and go insane.<br /><br />Ornette Coleman and company deliver a well rounded, excellent, focused jazz album, not bound by any scales or time signatures.  They build on the bebop/hardbop and modal jazz and add a bit of raw, addicting dissonants, and a great sense of freedom.  That's my favorite thing about this album, is that it has plenty of that, but there is a great sense of freedom and very tuneful.<br /><br />It's really not just a great way to slowly get into the world of free jazz and noisy music (everything from later Coleman to John Zorn's Naked City).  Besides, it's not one album you'll forget after using as a stepping stone.  It's not really a stepping stone, it's just an album that happens to be a good introduction for some people.  I don't care what your excuse is (as long as it's not to be \\"cool\\".  If so, your a _________ moron), get it.<br /><br />9/10ction for some people.

076531178X|4.0|Fantasy is not usually a genre I enjoy reading... all the books are the same, tedious, and boring.  For me, they usually have an overly detailed environment, with a cliche quest, and a lot of movement via magic or horses.  Something has to really pique my interest in order for me to (a) start reading a fantasy novel and (b) keep reading it to the end.<br /><br />This novel strays enough from the norm that there are refreshing plot elements brought into the genre.  There is magic, but it's a pretty cool system.  The plot centers around a thieving group... and the hero of prophesy had failed his quest 1000 years ago.  This novel is the future of failure.  Which is a little different.  What is not a little different is that the plot really is about the same \\"good\\" overcoming \\"evil\\".  The pace of the novel moves along appropriately, snowballing at the end.<br /><br />I'm really glad that there are more books in the series.  This first book is a strong start.  The reading level itself isn't too difficult, it's very straight forward writing that allows focus on plot and characters.
B0012Q732O|2.0|I'm sorry.<br /><br />**SPOILERS AHEAD**<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie up to a certain point. I'm a romantic and when a movie projects itself as a romantic love story, I expect the best. I hate sad endings.<br /><br />A sad ending to me negates everything that came before and I feel like I wasted my time watching this film. I'll admit I didn't watch the last few minutes. I didn't care after the love interest was gone.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviews; good SFX, decent acting and forget the accents. Poetic license for crying out loud. Alternative history sideline was pretty cool. I enjoyed that. Almost felt like I was watching \\"Stargate\\" for awhile there.<br /><br />It just didn't work for me as a love story which, at heart, this is.<br /><br />Watch it but be warned.
B0013FXWVU|5.0|First, a confession. I'm an adult, and I still absolutely love Dr. Seuss. In fact, I probably appreciate him more now that I'm old enough to more fully grasp the layers of social commentary beneath the whimsical tales. Like other works by Dr. Seuss, this one carries a message of kindness and social justice, and the movie entertains with (tasteful) slapstick humor kids will love and jokes for the adults, too.<br /><br />Horton (voice acted by Jim Carrey) is a tender-hearted, if a bit goofy, elephant who hears a cry for help emanating from a tiny speck. Though he can't see the microscopically tiny people who issued the cry, he decides to save them, even though he is labeled crazy--even \\"dangerous\\"--for helping the invisible \\"Whos\\" no one else can hear. Particularly threatened by Horton's behavior is the jungle busybody Kangaroo, who keeps her son sheltered in her pouch even though he is far too old (in fact, she \\"pouch schools\\" him to ensure that he is not corrupted by the outside world). Rallying the others against Horton, Kangaroo accuses him of \\"teaching the children to use their imaginations,\\" which could lead to \\"anarchy.\\" Nonetheless, Horton is steadfast in his compassion for the invisible \\"little guy\\"--which could be a metaphor for the poor, children, or any other marginalized group--insisting that \\"a person's a person, no matter how small.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, in tiny Whoville, the Mayor (Steve Carrell) struggles to make the people realize they are in peril because their speck lacks a safe home. Two major obstacles stand in his way: the city council cares only about keeping the citizens happily distracted with festivities like the upcoming Centennial, and the citizens refuse to believe that they are merely a tiny civilization floating precariously on a speck of dust. The Mayor knows that the little people of Whoville must raise their voices and make themselves heard...but the real hero is JoJo, the mayor's sullen, silent son and the smallest Who of all.<br /><br />My only criticism is that a few of the characters were stereotypical: Vlad, the Russian vulture, whom Kangaroo hires to torment Horton, and Mayor's stereotypically \\"sassy\\" black secretary.<br /><br />The animation is wonderful...a visual feast true to Dr. Seuss' trademark whimsical style. Particularly amazing is the intricate animation of the Whoville Observatory. One humorous sequence has Horton imagining himself the hero of a badly synchronized anime, which is sure to draw laughs from fans of the genre.<br /><br />An endearing movie, true to the spirit of Seuss...great for all ages.ism is that a few of the characters were stereotypical: Vlad, the Russian vulture, whom Kangaroo hires to torment Horton, and Mayor's stereotypically \\"sassy\\" black secretary.

B0013TUJLC|4.0|I almost got thrown off by the only other review here of this album.  After considering the spelling and lack of grammar, and how much I like Amy's singing, I decided to risk buying the entire album. Since I've found other bands where the live albums were actually better than the studio stuff (Hot Tuna, The Wreckers, Counting Crows for a few), I thought the risk would be fairly low here and I was right.  This album isn't really better than the studio, but is still a very good live album and the new tracks are a treat.  I've enjoyed this album very much.

Lastly, the coda is musical perfection, mysterious & majestic.
B00164DWEA|2.0|The Incredible Hulk, the latest in the seemingly endless line of Marvel Comics affiliated movies is neither a sequel to nor a remake of Ang Lee's Hulk from 2003.  It's officially being called a reboot.  Though it's a better film than Lee's version which was filled with embarrassing moments like crazed mutated poodles and Nick Nolte, this version of the Incredible Hulk is about as underdeveloped plot wise as I've seen in a Marvel movie.  It flies by with little to no characterizations, plot development, or emotional connection for any of the characters.  Instead it's mostly loaded with chases and fights, which are generally well done, but they feel disconnected because the plot development is so lacking.      One thing I enjoy about the Marvel movies is that they can generally be enjoyed by folks who aren't fans of the comic book.  They usually include an origin, establish the character, and outline the important relationships in his or her life early on in the movie.  This isn't the case with the Incredible Hulk.  We don't get much of an origin to speak off.  Instead, all we see is Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) being strapped in to some kind of machine during the opening credits.  We see glimpses of Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), General Ross (William Hurt) standing around watching Banner go through his experiments.  We see him turn in to the Hulk, trash some things, and in about two minutes we're done.  Being a comic book fan, I'm aware of Banner's origin and I'm familiar with the basic details of the Hulk.  But for a non-fan this can be confusing.  We don't get to see what led up to Banner's experiments, and the film makes a halfhearted attempt to explain it through some vague dialogue later on that's really not all that helpful.      So after the cliff notes origin, we zip five years later to Brazil where Banner is working in a soda bottling factory and hiding from the US Government who's hunting him.  These scenes suffer from the same thin development as the origin scene.  He apparently has a love interest, an attractive woman who he works with, but we don't see them interact really.  He's also apparently working on keeping his anger under control, but we don't see him really struggle with it.  That's part of the appeal of the Hulk.  Banner struggles with having this immense power that he can't control.  Eventually General Ross gets wind of his location and we get first of the major action set pieces in the movie.  It's basically a mad dash through the small Brazilian Village that ends in a confrontation with the Hulk and Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) in the Soda Bottling plant.  Again, these set pieces are good visually and are exciting, but I find myself not caring because nothing has been established character-wise or plot-wise.      From there we see Banner seek out his girlfriend Betty Ross and try to find a cure through the mysterious Mr. Blue/Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson).   We get more thin development of their romance, and another big action piece, but this time Blonsky is beefed up with super solider serum.  We're suppose to believe in Blonsky's growing obsession with the Hulk that drives him to further and further extremes, eventually ending in his becoming the Abomination.  Unfortunately, Roth, normally a good actor, seems too monotone to be believable.  I just didn't buy in to his whole aging warrior mentality and his obsession with Banner/Hulk.      I don't think I need to summarize the rest of the plot.  It's zip along briskly until the last confrontation with Abomination and the Hulk.  We don't get any information on Betty's and the General's relationship either besides some superficial arguing, and we see a bit of Samuel Sterns who turns in to an important villain later on, but not much.  We also get to see Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) make a cameo and tease an Avengers movie.  He's so much more charismatic than anyone else in the Marvel film universe.  Maybe they can just scrap an Avengers movie and make it an Iron Man and Wolverine movie instead.  Those are by far the most interesting characters they've put to film so far.         This reboot of the Hulk is superficially entertaining, but it's thinly developed plot kept me from enjoying it too much.  They appear to be teasing a sequel, with Banner working on controlling the Hulk, and Sterns becoming a villain in the sequel.  They sort of botched the groundwork here though.  After Iron Man, this is a definite step down for the Marvel movies.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|So Wes Anderson seems to be on a bit of a downslide as of late, but that does not mean that I do not enjoy this film as with his others.<br /><br />So The Darjeeling Limited is not his best film at all, but still a good movie.  I can understand that if you are not a Wes Anderson fan, you might not really get the movie and find it slow, but if you are a Wes Anderson fan, then this film may reach you.<br /><br />Really, the backbone theme that I get form this movie that Wes had not really explored as much before was the idea of mourning and loss.  The characters in the movie are going on a rather vain and ridiculous \\"spiritual journey\\" to help mourn the loss of their father, their absent mother, and whatever else in life is bothering them.  It is full of superficial feelings and the boys then learn about because of an incident when they experience true loss and see absolute mourning of an entire village.  This events gives them the strength tor really go and confront their absent mother in an attempt to heal themselves.<br /><br />Like I said, the movie is paced a little slow, but I still love the story line and the acting as well as the directing.  That was my one real complaint with his last movie, \\"The Life Aquatic\\" was the pacing and editing of the film.  It really made itself choppy and forced.  As much as I loved the story and the acting, it is hard for me to watch.  This one is not as choppy and is put together much more smoothly overall.<br /><br />I recommend this to all Wes Anderson fans as well as indie film buffs, but outside of that, I can see where others will be turned off by it.
0385340567|2.0|I'm a big Lee Child fan, so I grabbed his latest book, anticipating a weekend of pleasure.  It has a really leaden plot, and Reacher is a cardboard character.  This book was much more of a political diatribe on the costs of the Iraq war than a compelling thriller.  Skip it and wait for the next one.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Really, it is hard to go wrong with an Oasis record.  They always have some good lyrics hovering over some good rock music.  To me, none of their albums, with maybe the exception of \\"What's the Story\\" are really totally great and timeless, but overall, it is good rock music.
0345495004|4.0|This is a beautifully written book, a novelization of the life of two real people who famously created a scandal by falling in love and running off together, even though both were married to others at the time.  You understand clearly the overwhelming passions that caused them to feel that they were meant for one another.  But you also understand the pain and problems caused by what can only be seen as their selfishness in pursuing their dream at the expense of others.   It is interesting also as a picture of a different time with different ideas of, and ways of dealing with morality as well as a look at how feminism was affecting everyone. Also,there is fascinating detail about Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture.
B00164KYS2|5.0|I have been a fan of HBO's Sex and the City since it's premiere in 1998, when I was a little nerdito sneaking into my parent's basement, trying to catch a glimpse of Kim Catrall's bare breasts. As a little nergin in Los Angeles who only knew the pleasure of my own hand, I was amazed at the glittering word of frantic New Yorkers having sex, and quickly became addicted. My mom thought the show was the \\"work of the devil,\\" so I had to sneak a peak every chance I got, but it was enough for me to know that I was watching the BEST SHOW EVER!    Since the show's premiere, Carrie Bradshaw and Co. taught a generation of women how to dress, be confident with themselves, and act as slutty as possible, so when the rumored movie finally took shape, I couldn't be more excited! I missed Carrie and the girls dearly since they left the air in 2004. Kim Catrall's breasts were edited out of the KTLA and TBS reruns, so the only image I had of them were my faded memories from the show's heyday. There was so much secrecy with the movie's plot, and Sarah Jessica Parker went on record saying that the trailer was edited to deceive, so I didn't know what to expect. La Coacha and I were so excited to see this, we had our tickets weeks in advance and planned to make an evening of it with our friends. So after dinner, we all headed to the theater, squealing and screaming with delight. I felt like a giddy school girl, drunk with anticipation. So was the movie worth the hype? Did it measure up to the brilliance of Mean Girls and Clueless? The answer is....    YES! This movie was everything I expected, and more! The ladies have grown up, matured, and found their rightful place in life. But, as we all know, life is not always happily ever after, and this movie explores that to the fullest. And while it's exactly as the trailer made it out to be, it was still a wonderful ride getting to that final moment. And two and a half hours later, I wish it were longer.    So what happened since the show ended? If you haven't seen the movie and want to be surprised, skip ahead NOW.    Carrie is still in a relationship with Big, and he finally proposes, but leaves her at the altar. Charlotte has moved on from being a closeted ho (c'mon, she would pretend to be all innocent but slept with almost as many men as Samantha), and is still married to fugly beast Harry (boy is he ever!) and is mom to a cute little third world child. Miranda is married to Steve, living in Brooklyn, and not having sex, while Samantha is hornier than ever because her boyfriend Smith works all the time (sadly, while there is plenty of sex, Kim Catrall's breasts never cameo.)    While a lot is crammed into two and a half hours, and the men play second fiddle to the ladies, this movie really is a valentine to the millions of loyal Sex and the City fans out there. I didn't quite know what to expect, and while the film has the predictability of many past romantic movies, this is still more intelligently written and better acted than most romantic comedies out there - Charlotte's `mean' look and one-liner to Big, and Samantha's 'sushi surprise' for Smith are utterly priceless, as is the little `accident' Charlotte has in Mexico. I did miss Standford's boyfriend Marcus (not cause I'm gay or anything), and I wish Smith and Harry had some more to do in the film, but I was glad to have them there just the same. The characters get their happily ever after yet again (and Carrie finally aquires her dream closet), and I almost died in movie bliss. I really hope the much talked about sequel gets made.    So overall, I give this movie two dicks up and recommend that all fans and non-fans alike, see it immediately. This straight guy loved it and plans to see it again very soon.    [...]

0553573403|5.0|I am a long time fantasy fiction reader who had been away from the genre for a while when a friend gave me this novel. Once I started reading I had trouble putting it down.<br /><br />Mr. Martin doesn't pull any punches. He is not afraid to let the characters he has created play out their destinies. Mr. Martin also uses an interesting device in that each chapter is written from a particular character's perspective. The excellent prose, and dialog that rings true allows the distinctive voices of each character to come alive. You may see something of your friends, family, or co-workers in these characters.<br /><br />In this, first novel of the world-building A Song of Fire and Ice series, readers will find themselves hard pressed not to be drawn in. It is a world in which massive egos and bare knuckled back-room politics cause blood to run in the streets. It is a world where honor is tested and naivet&eacute; come face to face with the naked blade. You will quickly find yourself becoming attached to the players, but don't get too attached. You never know what fate will have in store for them in.

069452378X|2.0|The reader, a deservedly acclaimed actor, who was made famous by playing Charles Ryder on T.V. made the recording sound flat.  The weariness was probably an interpretive style; but, it made the listening to the recording difficult.
B0014XCMVM|4.0|Flavors of Entanglement by Alanis Morissette is an album I have been waiting for after her winning 2004 cd, So-Called Chaos. I had high hopes for this album but part of me feels slightly letdown. I love Alanis to pieces, all her albums before this one are brilliant and memorable. Flavors of Entanglement isn't awful, there are only a couple songs that don't flow well, In Praise of the Vulnerable Man and Moratorium. The rest of the tracks are strong and full of surprises thanks to producer Guy Sigsworth (love those loops and synths!). Alanis's songwriting and singing are still stunning but I felt something was lacking and the main problem with this album are the lack of melodies, Alanis always had powerful melodies but this time around it seems she's lost some of her magic. There are some beautiful moments on tracks like Tapes, Torch, Incomplete, Straitjacket, and Giggling Again for No Reason. The first single, Underneath falls a bit awkward in verses but the chorus is big and intoxicating. Flavors... shines in places so hopefully this album will get more exciting with each listen. Forever Alanis fan!
B00006ADD5|5.0|This is one of the most powerful films ever made. Put this with \\"Gone With the wind\\" This movie has it all, and I think because of its success it was all men characters, there was no blonds drowning out an epic movie.     This verison as the \\"INTRO\\", \\"INTERMISSION\\" and \\"OUTRO\\" you should watch it in full. but you can skip the intro and intermission and outro.     This version is also cheaper then the one thta came out recently with a 2 disc box set. Go for this one, it's cheep and its the same movie.     it has a couple of features but that about it.     enjoy.

B00005JKZV|5.0|\\"The Two Towers\\" is as close to a perfect movie as I've seen.  It's epic in scope, both in the actual story as well as the task of adapting the book into a movie.  While showing respect for the source material, Jackson wasn't afraid to tweak here and there in order to make the story work as a movie.  Instead of having half the movie tackle the Aragorn/Rohan story and the latter half detail Frodo and Sam's quest towards Mordor like the book did, the movie blends these two story lines together and makes them flow together as one cohesive story.<br /><br />If you liked and enjoyed [[ASIN:B000067DNF The Fellowship of the Ring]], things just get better from this point.  The direction is ambitious in a way that elevates the beauty of the story and Midde-earth in general to a whole new level.  The beautiful score is enough to bring tears to your eyes during the emotional moments and will make you hug your legs closer to your body during the battle scenes.  And oh there are plenty of those.  The battle at Helm's Deep is a cinematographic triumph , showing fighting that it better choreographed than any dance could hope to be.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is simply a masterpiece of epic proportions that should be as renowned as the source material.  Whether you like the [[ASIN:B00005JKZV widescreen]] version, [[ASIN:B00009APK1 full screen]], or the [[ASIN:B00009TB5G extended]] edition, this is something that everyone should see.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.

B000002I8D|5.0|The greatest album ever made.<br />Face Value is an amazing combination of jazz, rock, R&B and pop. The fact that it was written and recorded after Phil's first divorce, forces real emotion to the lyrics and feel of the music. You can't help but feel his pain. Yet, no two songs are alike. Since it was never intended as a public release, the entire work is extremely personal. Each song is a story by itself. Real thought and emotion goes into the lyrics. It isn't just 3 or 4 words sung over and over again like many modern songs we are used to hearing on the radio. People who give this album an undeserving one star, seem to be disgruntled Gabriel fans, who are upset with Phil filling his shoes in Genesis.<br />1. In The Air Tonight -The cr&egrave;me al la cr&egrave;me of all Phil Collins. Arguably, Phil's best vocal recording ever. The songs starts off slow and haunting with the relentless sound of the drum machine (necessary for the mood), then builds into an explosion of drums and emotion. The energy released is like an atomic bomb. Just unforgettable. Lyrics like \\"If you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand\\", even though they are fictional, still send chills up the spine. A true masterpiece.<br />2. This Must Be Love- One of Phil's divorce songs. The lyrics tell the story of how bad the pain can be of being in love. We've all been there and we all can relate.<br />3. Behind the Lines- A sped up version of the Genesis version of the same name. The horns add another dimension to an already amazing song. I'm not saying it's better or worse than the Genesis version. I'm saying it's different.<br />4. The Roof is Leaking- A moving story about a poor family trying to get through the cold of Winter and surviving the elements. The picture is painted so perfectly, you can actually feel the cold and wind and see the water dripping through the ceiling. If it were a film, it would be worthy of an Oscar.<br />5. Droned- A short instrumental that works well as a bridge between \\"Roof is Leaking\\" and \\"Hand in Hand\\". Alone, it can put you in a trans like mood, thanks, in part, to the contribution of Ravi Shankar.<br />6. Hand in Hand- Absolutely amazing! Although there are no lyrics, there are so many things going on in this song, it is almost sensory overload. One of Phil's most amazing demonstrations of his drumming ability. It's the exact opposite of his drum machine sound of  \\"In the Air Tonight\\", yet keeps the rhythm of the song flawlessly. The sound of overpowering horn section hasn't been this good since the \\"Big Band\\" era. If you try to listen to each track individually, you'll think they are all doing their own thing, which makes you appreciate how it all fits together into a single song. You can listen over and over without it getting boring. Yes, it's THAT good.<br />7. I Missed Again- A poppy song that is also very catchy. Another nice combination of drums, horns and vocals. Great for the radio.<br />8. You Know What I Mean- A song that will rip your heart out. The lyrics are very powerful. Anyone who has ever been in love can relate to how painful it is to break up, yet still have feelings for the significant other. Pure torture.<br />9. Thunder and Lightning- a jazzy song that uses the power of a thunderstorm to paint an amazing picture in your mind.<br />10. I'm not Moving- Another divorce song that can show the conflict of love and hate. The stubbornness of not wanting to move on, even though it would be the best choice to make.<br />11.  If Leaving Me Is Easy- Arguably, the best ballad ever written. The song paints a perfect picture of the love Phil had for his wife. It turns your heart to jelly, but then, towards the end, the song literally STABS with pure emotion that pours like blood from a bleeding heart. You can actually feel the pain in Phil's voice. Like a 5 minute feature film...unbelievable.<br />12. Tomorrow Never Knows- A Beatles remake that features some of the tracks from this album played backwards.A worthy attempt at a tribute to the \\"Fab 4\\". Make sure you turn up the volume all the way at the end to catch Phil sing \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\".<br />[[ASIN:B000002I8D Face Value]]rn up the volume all the way at the end to catch Phil sing \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\".   [[ASIN:B000002I8D Face Value]]
B0014XCMVM|4.0|Enjoyed this one quite a bit. From beginning to end,it has some upbeat and slower,trademark Alanis songs. Not gonna tell you that this album is her best,because it isn't,but I'm sure if you like Alanis like I do,you will find very appreciable songs on this album.I have enjoyed all her efforts since Jagged Little Pill.Also love Alanis as a song writer. Her lyrics are rich.Of course,none of her previous albums ever topped Jagged,in my opinion.Underneath,Versions of Violence.Not As We,In Praise of The Vulnerable Man and Torch will appeal to any Alanis fan. They were my fave standouts from the album.Of course,we all have different tastes,but those are the songs ,I would pay a little more atention to.So,if you were hesitant on buying,don't...Go get it now. You will like it a lot. A solid 4.5 stars for a quite enjouyable,well written effort.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Across the Universe took me back to my teenage years when The Beatles were the most important part of my life. The story and production take us to a simple basic love story, where the Beatles make it a trip back in time. I saw it 5 times in movie theatres because I feared I was never going to see it in the big screen again and I just needed to keep that image  that covers all of my peripheral vision, however, the DVD is great! Joe Cocker ROCKS! Jim Sturgess is adorable! and Bono is a Bonus. Julie Taymor knew what she was talking about!

B000001EKX|5.0|Most have something to say about the production of this record.  It is, to be blunt, lo-fi, and sharply contrasts with their next record, Dressed to Kill, which is very clean and bright sounding.  This is the only Kiss release I have the remastered version of, if that's any indication.  Having said that, I love Hotter Than Hell in any form.  There's not alot of well known Kiss songs on this record but it works.  This is the last Kiss record (being only their 2nd release) to have a \\"from the streets\\" feel to it.  Some songs on Dressed to Kill qualify as \\"street\\" but again, the production is more polished on Dressed to Kill and later Kiss records are from a band that has started to make it big and the songwriting comes from a different place (the make-up personas creep in).  Hotter Than Hell is perhaps the tightest Kiss ever sounded, the playing is excellent and it's one of the few Kiss records that I like all the way through.  At first listen there's not much that jumps out at you but despite the sound, the production is not as simple as it may seem.  If you can adjust the balance on your speakers, listen to the left and right channels separately for awhile, especially on Parasite and the guitar solo(s) on the title track.  A great rock n roll record that comes from a certain place and time never to be repeated.
B000RMQH30|5.0|It seems like each and everyday Ben Harper's music continues to grow on me.  I have known his music for a decade but didn't really become a fan until a couple of years ago.  He is trully one of the most creative artists of his time.  He can go from rock, soul, funk, R&B, gospal, and even bluegrass over a course of an album and it never sounds forced or chessy.    Lifeline is a fantastic album.  \\"Into the Colors\\" is a great first single and the album is packed with great tracks throuhout.  If you are a Ben Harper fan then you will not be disappointed with this purchase.  This is one of the best albums in the music industry over the past few years.
B000784WMW|5.0|I'd never have believed that anyone could make the long, flowery, ornate, 19th century language in Charlotte Bronte's novel sound natural in a modern-day production -- \\"my pet lamb\\" -- and \\"Jane, you strange, almost unearthly thing,\\" etc. etc. or that I would find a James Bond actor believable as Rochester. Wrong on both counts. Timothy Dalton's performance here is really a tour de force. He's mercurial, explosive, intense, brooding, cunning, manipulative, self-pitying, insightful, mischievous, sexual, tender, loving, gentle, sometimes all at the same time or at least in the same five minute scene. He's the original \\"mad, bad, and dangerous to know,\\" to use Caroline Lamb's words about her lover Byron. That is, of course, like catnip. You watch him on the screen and know he's very bad news and you also know you wouldn't be able to resist. I'm not quite sure how Zelah Clarke's Jane is able to resist. Too handsome and too young, yes, but the portrayal more than makes you forget that.    Clarke is an interesting Jane. There's a scene the morning after she accepts Mr. Rochester's proposal where she literally runs into his arms, absolutely beaming, that made me physically gasp. This is a Jane whose primary trait is her desire to be loved. She's not really meant to be mouselike or long-suffering or patiently enduring, though she's learned to put on a facade. When Rochester loves her, she loves him back innocently and wholeheartedly, which makes the scene after the big reveal about Rochester's mad wife in the attic all the more heartbreaking. Clarke's Jane resembles someone who's been kicked in the stomach, hurt too badly to cry or react or shout at Rochester like he's begging her to. Clarke plays all those subtleties expertly.     Like other reviewers, I did think she looked older than 18 or 19, but so do all of the other actresses who've played the part. On the other hand, I think Jane is supposed to be one of those ageless looking characters. She likely looked older whenshe was young and would have looked younger when she was old. Her life experiences would have provided her with a sense of self-possession that would have given her more maturity than a young debutante of the era. Clarke is physically very small, particularly next to Dalton, which is right for the character, but a bit more rounded out than the Jane of the book.    Comparing the recent screen versions of Jane Eyre, I've found something I like in most of them. The 1940s version with Orson Wells had the best young Adele in Margaret O'Brien. She's an adorable, enchanting little girl in that movie, as young as she should be according to the book. This movie also gets the Gothic air right, in part because it's black and white. On the other hand, Jane is too blonde and too composed, while Orsn Wells is too bombastic. The 1970s BBC version also uses all of the dialogue from the book, but I thought it was a bit more mannered than this 1983 version. The 1996 A&E version with Samantha Morton is shorter, very condensed, the language updated and the story cut to focus on Rochester and Jane. I preferred the ending scene in the A&E version when Jane returns to Rochester, over the 1983 version, which although true to the novel, seems to somehow diminish Rochester a bit, if not Jane. Morton's version of Jane doesn't drag out why she came back. She leaves Rochester in no doubt that he's still a man and she'd take him any way she could get him. I also thought the 2006 BBC version did a better job with those ending scenes than the 1983 version did, though some people object to its physicality. To paraphrase, as the 2006 version of Rochester says, \\"I don't want a nurse. I want a wife. You and I aren't platonic people, Jane.\\" The 1990s big screen version with William Hurt is mopey and melancholy and makes you long to put Rochester and Jane out of their misery. If you're a Jane Eyre aficionado, you'll probably want all of the above and, as I do, mix and match the various actors from eachmovie until you have your perfect daydream cast. I think Timothy Dalton's Rochester is the current headliner. This is a very good version that is well worth the trouble of buying. I have just ordered it myself after renting it through Netflix.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have purchased many workout DVDs over the years only to do them once and sell them later at a garage sale.  This DVD is excellent!  The workout was hard and really pushed me but it was not so hard that I felt like I couldn't follow the moves.  I got a great workout and my husband heard me doing it the first night and now he does it with me.  Jillian is not annoying and cheesy like some other workout DVDs but just motivating enough.  I have not made it through to Level 3 yet but the fact that you progress as you get stronger and more fit.  Overall I think this is a great workout DVD that provides an intense but doable workout in a short period of time.
B000SO7OL6|4.0|The CD is in a good condition, but the cover came broken. The good thing is that is very cheap.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I copied this cd from a friend and I'm happy I didn't spend my hard-earned cash on it. After a few listens, some of the songs became catchy and likable. The problems with the album are (a) Timbaland, who produces very repetitive, computer generated beats with no substance (b) lyrics written by a teenager - Miley Cyrus sings more provocative, thoughtful music than what can be found here (c) some of the songs sound exactly like those on JLo and Kylie Minogue's albums from over five years ago (embarrassed to say but I own those).   HOWEVER she is MAdonna and she can make any song worth listening to. I think she has two or three hits on this album, esp. song #4 !
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I decided to watch this movie on TV and not at the movie theater because friend had warned me about it making them dizzy and sick because of the camera work.  They were right.  I rented it last night and could only watch the first 40 minutes then I had to go vomit.  This could have been a great movie, it had great special effects and original story but the camera movements kill you.  Very dissapointing.
1594481938|1.0|I thought this would be a book about hope and living life to its fullest. Obviously the author has never been suicidal since a \\"topper\\" would not find validation in life the way these characters do. I read the whole book, expecting someone to die. The character, Jess, is a teenaged cliche and I ended up skipping over her chapters. Basically, these characters have no reason to live, not in the beginning nor the end of the story. Their circumstances aren't altered in any way. They have no joy. Friends. Family. Hope. Its a book about nothing but setting appointments an deadlines.
1400063515|4.0|Taleb could use a good editor, no doubt about it.  Taleb's writing can be very entertaining and informative when he does not distract and annoy the reader with childish throwaway asides. On the other hand, these asides act as road-signs: When you find one aside too many, just skip the rest of the chapter because it is of no major consequence. When Taleb takes to his subject, he writes like an adult. :)    The subject matter, which could have been covered in fewer pages, is about the fact that the normal or bell curve does not represent reality in many cases and in these instances predictions based on a normal distribution will be wildly wrong. I found particularly helpful some pointers about our understanding of  issues like \\"evidence\\" which may or may not prove your assumptions and \\"randomness\\" (not what you learn in a casino) which may be Gaussian or not.    The rest of the book is dedicated to various subjects such as the history of the Levant, not to be confused with the Middle East; a diatribe against the Nobel prize for economics; the academic pecking order; Taleb's travelogue including Rome, Paris, Sidney, Boston; and praises for philosophers and mathematicians Taleb happens to like including Mandelbrot and Poincare.     The reason for reading this book, if you are an investor, is to make sure you adapt your portfolio to the reality of Black Swans and avoid wrong assumptions and bad theories such as MPT, Black-Scholes, and Efficient Markets. If you are not highly leveraged then Black Swans will be less traumatic for your portfolio. Maybe Taleb should have railed against excessive leverage.     While Taleb does mention his dumbbell style of investing, don't expect to find an investing tutorial. He provides some clues but you will have to create your own unique style of harnessing good Black Swans and avoiding the bad ones.
B00164DWEA|5.0|A few years ago, Universal Pictures came forward and announced a new 'Hulk' movie. Their 2003 effort had failed both with critics and with its audience. They termed their upcoming film \\"a do-over\\", doing what most people cannot do : acknowledge incompetence.<br /><br />Apology accepted, Universal Studios.<br /><br />The best piece of advice I could offer is to not pre-judge this Hulk film based on the last one. This one is so good, it completely renders its predecessor unwatchable. It makes what was already a bad movie laughably bad. The film starts smart by encapsulating the Hulk's origin into the time it takes to run the opening credits., rather than waste valuable movie time drudging it out. Once the movie begins, with Brazil as a backdrop, the ride really begins.<br /><br />Edward Norton is excellent as Dr. Bruce Banner. He's probably one of the 5 or 6 best actors alive, and he was a great fit for the part. Liv Tyler as Dr. Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Ross was decent. I don't view her as an actress with a lot of range, but she was fine for this part. The biggest casting challenge, to me, would have been filling the tall shoes of Sam Elliott (the best part of the last film, and most wasted talent) portraying General Thaddeus \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross. William Hurt did more than an ample job in the role. General Ross is not so much a villain as he is an well-meaning antagonist. The villain role is reserved for Tim Roth who, as Blonsky, makes you hate him from the get-go. His quest for power is the antithesis for Banner's quest to remove his unwanted abilities, and as the saying goes, the immovable object ultimately meets the irresistable force.<br /><br />There are numerous references to the Hulk TV series scattered throughout, and mostly in a humorous manner. They don't parody the series, but they pay homage in a tip-of-the-cap fashion. And, as has been the modus operandi for Marvel character films, Stan \\"The Man\\" Lee, creator or co-creator of nearly every Marvel character in history, makes a cameo appearance. Humor is used subtlety yet effectively throughout the movie, but make no mistake : this movie is NOT a comedy, nor is it unintentionally funny as the last movie was. This is a movie about a man who is thrust into a situation where he needs to move continuously in order to find his inner peace. Banner is a man who seeks a cure not only for his body, but his soul.<br /><br />The action scenes are great, fast, and furious. The CGI is maybe the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie, and that says a lot, as this film's title character may have had to rely on it more than any of his super peers. The story is interesting, and keeps you involved.<br /><br />Marvel has taken over production of their character's movie production. In 2008, they've stepped up to the plate twice, and have hit the ball deep over the centerfield wall twice. This is not a \\"guy\\" movie, nor is it a children's film. This is a summer blockbuster that can be enjoyed by all, although the violence may be a little too much for very young children.<br /><br />As much as I liked 'Iron Man', I sincerely believe 'The Incredible Hulk' to have surpassed it. There is no need to stay through the end credits, as was the case with 'Iron Man', for a hidden scene gem. I wouldn't go as far as to say that 'The Incredible Hulk 2' has been set up by the end of the film, but I will say this : 'The Avengers' movie is coming, kids. Until then, I highly recommend this movie for fellow comic-book nerds, and even the casual moviegoer..

B0000DBJDM|4.0|\\"Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii - The Director's Cut\\" could have been a better film than it is, even with the extra and new footage, if Adrien Maben hadn't tried to run the gamut here. It's total overkill. The audio is now more clear sounding, and the picture is now sharper than it was, and some alternate footage from the time is included to enhance the experience, but there is some serious inconsistency in the bigger picture.<br /><br />In its original form, the viewer gets an opening sequence made up of some eerie music the band recorded for the film, some shots of the Roman ruins, and the preliminary stages of the road crew setting up the equipment. Now, there is a black screen, with a heartbeat and some heavy breathing. I felt like I was watching \\"Friday The 13th.\\" You then get some nice spacey images during the first bars of \\"Echoes: Part One,\\" looking suspiciously like Stanley Kubrik's \\"2001: A Space Oddessy.\\" It does fit the music, and it's probably what the band would have shown on \\"Mr. Screen,\\" as they called it, in the shows from those days, so I took this in stride. It is, after all, a new version. The visuals are really very beautiful during this, but the majesty of this performance is belied by footage of David Gilmour and Rick Wright recording the vocals to the original version in the studio. The sound itself is from the \\"concert,\\" but seeing them fumble through outtakes during this, takes the covers off them. And even though there is no acting, per se, Gilmour does what every film director says not to do; he looks directly at the camera between lines. But even with these glitches, the film still does look and sound good.<br /><br />And even cleaned up, the original footage, already in existence, as well as some other exposition, has a slightly gritty look to it, causing the \\"documentary\\" feel, and it works. But there is some computer-generated imaging which jars the viewer out of the lull they achieve while enjoying the band's performances. Time and circumstance do not allow a complete play-by-play in this forum, but if the original footage had a digital-era clarity, or the segments of new digital-era footage were slightly grittier looking, the transitions would have worked wonderfully. This is only my opinion. But, usually, new treatments are supposed to fit seamlessly into the original piece; here, it's the metaphorical \\"sore thumb.\\" And too bad, because it is a very ambitious cut, worthy of watching anyhow. The scenery shots, previously unused, are unbelievably beautiful. The landscapes, from the original cut, and the shots taken from the vault and added in, are breathtaking. For real.<br /><br />Certain things I wouldn't have done (I know, this is Adrien Maben's film, not Jerry H's film) if I were the director, though, include one thing I didn't care for, in the original film. It's not bad, but not what I would have done.  In some of the outdoor footage, there are  some stunning landscapes, with the band members walking through it, on an outdoor hike, looking something like The Beatles in \\"Yellow Submarine.\\" These shots should have been done without Waters, Wright, Mason, and Gilmour, out on some nature-hike. It's just pointless. They only worked together, they didn't go hiking and whatnot, but this is only a viewpoint. And the other thing: The newly included black-and-white footage of the interviews from the cafeteria. The only saving grace here, is some conversations with Rick Wright, conspicuously absent from the original cut. But, really, watching Roger Waters eat oysters for lunch, is one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen. I cringe at the sight of this, and even writing about it. And he obviously has a holier-than-thou attitude as well. He makes some very valid points in his conversations, but here, he is showing just how boorish he can be. But I guess, these parts show us that they are just a bunch of regular guys who laugh and joke with one another, they aren't embassadors from another planet. I just wouldn't have included these clips.<br /><br />But, as I have said earlier, sometimes the new edits work very well. During the climax of \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets,\\" there is some stock film of a volcano erupting, and the flooding of a city with hot lava, including a shot of a horrified little girl watching her home town being destroyed by one of God's temper tantrums. But, some of the additional visuals look like something you'd see while using a Play Station video game. This is what cost this video a star for me.<br /><br />Also, as a gift to the purist, the original \\"concert\\" is included in the bonus features, in tact, the first of the three releases, no interviews, no toying with the running order, just the band playing their best material of the day for the  camera crew, and this is a 5-plus rating on the 1 to 5 scale available here.<br /><br />My favorite bands are Pink Floyd, The Who, Steppenwolf, and The Mothers.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is highly addictive and fun for groups. What is so great about the game is that it is intelligent, interactive and dynamic.  The game is never the same and there is always strategy.    Additionally, the game is robust enough to allow you to make your own \\"house rules\\" and if you have mastered the regular version you can expand to allow more players and more complex game play.    You cannot go wrong with this game.  It is a classic must have.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Don't listen to the nay-sayers, this show is great.  It is funny, with a great cast and grand adventure.    The future in this show is probably much closer to reality than any of the other \\"future\\" sci-fi shows.  We won't find great civilizations with aliens, we won't become a great civilization.  We'll continue killing each other and our planet.  Chinese and American cultures will suffocate all other cultures, and so Chinese and English will become to main languages.  And we'll continue being the self-destructive beings that we are.
B0014XCMVM|4.0|I think Alanis is such an amazing artist, such a spiritual and moving life force, and such a great musician and songwriter that she requires little in terms of production to feature her at her best.  Here, she returns again with intimate, thought-provoking music about where she is in her life, and where she wants to be.<br /><br />For me, however, the arrangements and production tricks distract, and do not enhance, the overall experience.  Is there any need to \\"modernize\\" Alanis?  I don't think so -- she is so singular, so sui generis, that all that is needed is to set up the mikes and get out of the way.<br /><br />So, with that caveat, she has again managed to make an incredible musical statement, and of course her muse and message comes through loud and clear, production gimmicks or not.
B0012BTBQU|3.0|I read the author's first book, Elantris and liked it. It prompted me to check out his new series. Unfortunately it's not nearly as good.<br /><br />The whole premise of the book is unique - a weird mist covers the world and a ruthless ruler rules over the people. Somewhere in that though the book sort of gets bogged down. Im more than half way through it and nothing really major has happened. The characters aren't really unique or interesting save kelser and vin. I've found myself more bored than anything.<br /><br />I'd have to say this book is more of a rental from the library than a purchase. There's just not enough happening, not enough interesting characters, and a stagnant plot. That being said the book isn't bad, it just needs a jolt or something to get things going. Hopefully in the next book he can do a little retooling and go back to what worked in Elantris.

0060531053|5.0|I bought this book as a gift. I have the same book, only the third edition. If its like the third edition its got all the answers, and is easy to read.
1416523359|5.0|Ok...in the beginning of this book, I had a difficult time comprehending the writing...the thoughts going back and forth were a bit difficult to grasp. It was well worth holding on. The book was amazing.<br /><br />I couldn't get enough of the book, and when I had to put it down to get in the car and run someplace I found myself in withdrawal. So I went to the library and grabbed the audio version. While in the house I'd read, while in the car I listened.<br /><br />I love Stephen King and a couple of his recent books seemed a bit 'off' to me and left me disappointed. I feared he was running out of ideas...that the pool had gone dry. Lisey's Story is the old King...back fully, complete with diarrhea of the word processor and a story that can horrify you yet touch on the most intimate and personal human emotions at the same time.<br /><br />BRAVO MR KING!
B0015GDVTU|5.0|This has to be the best movie I have seen in a long time! Not only is the acting supurb, but the story itself is wonderful. I don't think there was a moment during the film where I wasn't crying. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!
0143058525|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was sad, funny, very spiritual, searching, and deeply honest. One woman's couragous journey to find her authentic self.  I have given the audio version of this book (on CDs) as gifts to my friends who had not read it.  The verdict has been unanimous - excellent read!!  By the way, we are all spiritually  minded - perhaps that is why we loved it so much.  This is a REAL love story - and she found the love she was searching for in food, God, herself and a good man.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|In my opinion this is the best movie yet produced on what is, arguably, the greatest story ever told.  Granted, it is a Hollywood interpretation of the famous epic and is, therefore, inaccurate.  The screenwriters, however, clearly love Homer's tale and try to do justice to it.  They've just tried to tweak it a little.<br /><br />We see remorseless Agammemnon sacrifice his only daughter so that favorable winds will blow for the Greek fleet.  We see near-immortal Achilles playing with his women prior to deadly battle.  Actually this scene doesn't accord with the Iliad.  Achilles, who has been warned of his death at Troy, has dressed up like a woman and is hiding with them.<br /><br />We see Paris and Helen too weak to subdue their fatal desire.  We see Hector and old Priam--for reasons we never completely understand--refuse to discipline the wayward couple and return fair Helen to her husband.<br />We see the mechanical Achilles slaughter ranks of his enemies.<br /><br />Still, the story does diverge from the Iliad.  There is a duel between Helen's husband, Menelaus, and Paris.  Menelaus proves victorious but, when he goes to kill Paris, Hector intervenes and slays the cuckolded man.  Not true.  In the story Paris is whisked away to the arms of Helen by the Goddess Aphrodite.  Menelaus lives to reclaim his wife after the fall of the doomed city.<br /><br />The other, more fundamental change the scriptors made, was to minimize the supernatural component of the story.  Most of the events have natural explanations whereas, in the Iliad, events are dictated by bickering Gods.<br /><br />No matter.  Hector, both in the movie and in the Iliad, is sympathetic as the doomed hero fighting for his city.  He's a mighty warrior but he must fight against the Achilles demi-god.  He almost prevails but, in the end, there is no escaping death at Achilles' hand.  It is, after all, fate.<br /><br />I love the story so I liked the movie.  We are witness to events 3,200 years ago still we take sides and--even though we know what the outcome must be--we hope things will turn out differently.  It's remarkable in its own way.  Since the fall of Troy countless cities and civilizations have fallen but Homer's tragic tale makes us weep.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\" on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico.ome must be--we hope things will turn out differently.

078322737X|4.0|American Graffiti is a classic film.  Those \\"reviewers\\" who bemoan the fact that this existence was idyllic and far removed from their own experience are missing the point.  Such \\"remove\\" is precisely the point.  The film came out in 1973, and depicted American life exactly 10 years in the past.  And yet America had changed so vastly in that tiny space of time that this film showed us a culture as alien in 1973 as it is compared to today.  On the heels of Viet Nam and Watergate, this film blew us away by showing how life was just 10 years in the past.  Imagine seeing a movie today set in 1998.  Very little would look or sound different.  Yet in American Graffiti, it was a world in which nothing was familiar anymore.    That said, the \\"Collector Edition\\" is another bungled-up \\"sound remastering\\" job.  Somebody needs to de-Spielburg these folks: take away their darn volume knob!  They've amped up the music to the point of being absurd.  If you can hear the conversations, then the next song is going to blast your eardrums out.  If you adjust the music so it is palatable, you can't hear the dialogue.  Plus they've simply amped up the mid-range, so you lose the highs and lows of these classic songs.  Somebody PLEASE inform these clowns that simply amplifying the mid-range and blasting up the volume is not \\"re-mastering.\\"  George Lucas should sue them for ruining his classic film.
0375842209|1.0|I'm trying to work my way through to finish this book, but it is doubtful. I hate the disjointed writing style.  Author takes forever to get to the point.  I wouldn't have picked up on the point that it is being told from the point of view of the \\"grim reaper\\" if I hadn't read the reviews, the author doesn't just spell it out.  All the vague, poetic inserts are just annoying.  I can't see any \\"young adult\\" wanting to be bothered with this...but I honestly feel there is a good story underlying the poor writing method and that's what will make me finish it on principal I suppose.
B0012E6R3W|3.0|Ever since I completed my Testament collection a few years ago, by downloading the two songs from Demonic he doesn't growl all the way through, I've been eagerly awaiting a new Testament album.  I had high expectations going in because even my least favorite album of theirs, except Demonic, I still liked quite a bit.  I'd say I like this one about as much as The ritual or Souls Of black.  The album for the most part has a newer Testament sound with a mostly older style, with some new thrown in as well.  I like that their original lead guitarist is back.  One thing I missed on The Gathering was the great guitar solos.  If you're a Testament fan then you can't go wrong with buying this album.  Most of it is at least worth listening to, and there's nothing really horrible.    More Than Meets The Eye - 9/10  A quick paced song, and a good opener, not counting the instrumental.  I like the beat of the drums, and the guitar solo's a good one.  Nice mix of growls in the background during the last chorus.    The Evil Has Landed  -  6/10  This one's played quickly, but the verses have a slower pace to them.  The chorus ismoves a little more.  Musically this one's ok.  The vocal melodies are pretty good.  There's just something about this song that I don't care for.  Mostly I think it's the lyrics.  I'm not saying they couldn't pull off a 911 song, but the lyrics seem a little too blunt for me.    The Formation Of Damnation  -  3/10  No.  Just no.  I don't care for songs where all of the vocals are growling, and Chuck doesn't have good sounding growl anyway.  Songs like this are why I don't care for but two songs on Demonic.  I don't mind some growling, D.N.R. and Down For Life are great songs and I love how he uses his growl in those, I just can't get into a whole song of it.    Dangers Of The Faithless  - 5/10  I like the chorus, but I can't get into the verses.  I just really hate them.  Mostly it's the vocals, which are almost just talking.      The Persecuted Won't Forget  - 5/10  So we had a song with a good chorus, but crappy verses, now we get a song with good verses and no real chorus.  This one's a faster paced song.  This one just doesn't have anything after the verses that stick with me.    Henchman Ride  - 9/10  Here we go.  This is another quick-paced song.  I like the beat, it's different from that of the other songs on here.  The music and vocals are all well done.  This is easily one of my favorites on the album.  This one's becoming my favorite on the album.  I tend to think of this one when I'm at work and I need to be pumped up.    Killing Season  - 8/10  This is another good one.  It's a little slower, but not much, than the previous song.  The beat of this one's a little different as well.  I like the chorus    Afterlife  - 6/10  This one's a step or so slower than most of the songs on here.  It's ok, but nothing really special.  Untill I listen to it, I really don't remember it.    Fear  - 9/10  This is another faster one, and for a while was my favorite on here.  I like how the verses and chorus have completely different beats to them, yet they flow together well.  Someone should tell Disturbed that it's ok to change things up, mid-song every now and again.  I like towards the end of the song how he moves from his scream to his growl.  Great tune.  This one also pumps me up a bit.    Leave Me Forever  4/10  I just can't get into this one.  The first thought I had when I heard it was that the verses reminded me of the intro to a godsmack song.  I can't remember the name of it right now, it was on their Faceless album and it was a single.  Testament should not be sounding like Godsmack at all.  I also can't get into the relationship lyrics.  I remember being annoyed at Megadeth for doing it on the World Needs A hero album.  I remember that song had one of the better melodies and music, but the lyrics were awful.  The lyrics in this one are better, much better actually than that, but the song itself doesn't do muchfor me.  The vocals in the verses are ok, a bit different for Chuck, which is a good thing, but the song just doesn't do anything for me.    Overall it's an ok album.  It's certainly one of the better purchases you can make this year.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|Overall, if you go into the movie with the right expectations, you'll be in for a good thrill, a lot of fun, a one helluva sense of nostalgia. Unfortunately, a very poor story, less than thrilling characters, and incredibly over-the-top action keep this one on the ground. I'd rank it third in the series, only in front of Temple of Doom, which it shares a lot of problems with.<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5<br /><br />Warning, if you have not seen this film, and have tried to avoid all spoilers thus far, you'll be well served when you see the film, because this movie is chock full of very important spoilers. It's darn tough, but I made it through three weeks of release without hearing anything totally major, and the experience was better because of it. From this point, be warned: HERE BE SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />Indy: Ahhh, since riding of on the Jordanian sunset, the good doctor has been very busy indeed. First, he fought in World War 2 (wouldn't you pay to see THAT movie???), and when the aliens landed in Roswell, he was there too, for some strange reason we're never quite privy to. The good doctor can still kick butt, and do incredible stunts, once again proving that like cows, Indiana Jones gets tougher with age. Whether you like this fact or not, since let's face it, Harrison can get the senior discount at Disney Land, right? Really, he hasn't changed personality wise since the last film, he's the same old professor, stressing old. You'll get giddy when he puts his hat on, and let's face it, you love seeing the icon again, right?<br /><br />Mutt: First off, what kind of name is \\"Mutt\\" for a potential future action hero? And what kind of iconic weapon is a pocket knife, which I believe is was lost in the movie? This could have been a great character, and in some senses he is, but he could have been a helluva lot better. He has a great personality, but he didn't really show he could be the next Indy like Phoenix did back in 'Last Crusade.' And I was very disappointed that Indy didn't pass the torch to Mutt. I mean, are we supposed to deal with old Harrison for another movie, kicking butt in a wheelchair? There's one scene where Mutt almost puts on Indy's hat, which would have been a great ending, but instead Indy takes it away. Very disappointing Spielberg.<br /><br />Other Characters: I found a bunch of characters in this movie just plain uninteresting. Marion, Mac, Oxley, the new dean, and the supporting baddies just didn't interest me. Not to say they were bad characters, I just didn't care for them. Bad character development. And Oxley could have been easily written out in favor for a more interesting plot-mover.<br /><br />Villain: Cate Blanchett is possibly the most overrated actress today. Which isn't hard, when she's almost single handedly dominated the best actress nominations the past few years. Her character could the poorest developed character. Nothing like Belloq, or that rich white guy from 'Last Crusade.' I mean, she pops up, and we're supposed to go, 'Ooohhh, she's real evil.' Not really, I mean, she's more freaky than evil. She's fascinated by psychological warfare? Really, that just doesn't pack any sort of a interesting punch. The character was also stereotypically Russian baddie, in a bad way. I mean, could the character be any more cookie cutter?<br /><br />The Action: Now, Indy has always been about action, so if you don't have action, you don't have an Indy movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem nearly as fun as it was back in the 80's, and it seems a bit forced, and at times uninteresting and unoriginal. Sure the motorcycle chase is fun, but the whole \\"Hangar 51\\" sequence seems a bit forced, although it does have some of the best moments of the movie. The whole chase sequence in the jungle on the other hand straddles the Hollywood line between believably and just plain ridiculous.<br /><br />CGI: One of the things that George and Steven wanted to do with this movie is keep down the CGI in most cases. However, on which sequences to use the CGI, they chose poorly. CGI BDA (CGI Big Damn Ants) are really testing that Hollywood line, and I really could have done without them. On the other hand, in the overall worst scene in the movie, Mutt swings Tarzan style through the jungle with a bunch of monkeys, and when you watch the background, either somebody forgot their CGI, or somebody needs to go back to computer school. I mean, that was absolutely pathetic, and reminded me of the terrible action background from 'Temple of Doom.'<br /><br />Over the Top: Let me count the ways...<br /><br />1. BDAs scaling each other to get to Cate Blanchett.<br />2. Mutt's Tarzan aforementioned Tarzan sequence.<br />3. Our heroes fall down 3 huge waterfalls with only a scratch to show for it.<br />4. The fact Indiana Jones survives a nuclear explosion inside a refrigerator. Did it have airbags?<br />5. The fact Harrison Ford can take down hefty men twice as young and twice as strong.<br />6. The Aliens. Why Steven, WHY?!?<br /><br />Which brings me too...<br /><br />The Story: What bothered me the most was this: the reason it took so long to get another Indy out was because George and Steven wanted the perfect story, and it took them almost 20 years to find it. And THEY CAME UP WITH THIS????<br /><br />Let me set it up this way, Indy searches for El Dorado, the supposed city of gold with Mutt, who seeks his help to save his mother. Now I must admit, I heard this spoiler, since it already was the worst kept secret in Hollywood, and not hard to figure out. Mutt is Indy and Marion's son. So the family races the evil Russians to find the city of gold, which they find with the help of a half-crazed loon who looked into the eyes of the crystal skull too long, which looks strangely like an alien head. When they finally find the city through strange happenstance, they find a room with not surprisingly, a bunch of alien figures. These aliens by the way helped the Mayans build pyramids and invent technology, which of course they couldn't have figured out on their own, so of course it must be alien.<br /><br />The Aliens soon reveal the temple they've been living in as a large cover for their very large spaceship, which is a page directly out of Stargate. The Aliens then leave, taking all the baddies, and giving Cate an overwhelming amount of knowledge, which promptly causes her to explode. The aliens then take the whole valley with them, and leave no trace. Indiana Jones then explains that El Dorado was not the city of gold, but rather the translation of the city of knowledge. Indy and Marion then get married.<br /><br />I blame David Keopp for this utterly lazy and stupid story, and I blame Steven and George for not realizing it was as bad as it was. I mean, the aliens still look the same as they did in the Spielberg movies years ago. They just don't change their look. Now, I could rail more against the story and aliens, but it appears I've almost written a book here...<br /><br />Anyways, we now can add what to expect with 4th movies from now on. 1st movies in classic series are usually classic and groundbreaking. 2nd usually isn't that great, and is bitter disappointment, and a scar that the director will never live down, they're the ones that ruin the series. The 3rd one may not be as good as the first, but it comes pretty darn close, usually dealing with something besides the action, although that's still there, but it just adds a bit more heart. We can now say that the 4th movie is a crapshoot, and you never can know what to expect. The 4th may not be as good as 1 and 3, but it beats 2, and still retains the aspect of what made the series good in the first place.A (CGI Big Damn Ants) are really testing that Hollywood line, and I really could have done without them. On the other hand, in the overall worst scene in the movie, Mutt swings Tarzan style through the jungle with a bunch of monkeys, and when you watch the background, either somebody forgot their CGI, or somebody needs to go back to computer school. I mean, that was absolutely pathetic, and reminded me of the terrible action background from 'Temple of Doom.'    Over the Top: Let me count the ways...    1. BDAs scaling each other to get to Cate Blanchett.  2. Mutt's Tarzan aforementioned Tarzan sequence.  3. Our heroes fall down 3 huge waterfalls with only a scratch to show for it.  4. The fact Indiana Jones survives a nuclear explosion inside a refrigerator. Did it have airbags?  5. The fact Harrison Ford can take down hefty men twice as young and twice as strong.  6. The Aliens. Why Steven, WHY?!?    Which brings me too...

B000A2XC1C|4.0|I haven't seen this film in such pristine glory since it's initial release in 1985 while I was stationed in England as a 21 year old Air Force airman, and it took me back to that simpler time in my life.  The effects hold up very well in this new DVD (unlike previous video and television versions which looked like they were recorded straight from a TV monitor), especially the full shots of the sleigh team in flight.  The only (minor) problem I had was with the film's continuity during one scene:  during the chase to the North Pole, the six reindeer are at an incredible speed cutting thru the sky, but when Santa stands up in the sleigh shouting encouragement to his team, his loose-hanging coat DOES NOT flap in the wind--AT ALL!!!  That has always bothered me; maybe they can do a Director's Cut sometime and fix that!  LOL.  In any case, the movie overall will stand as a Christmas classic, or just a feel-good injection whenever I need a pick-me-up!
B0016AJU2C|4.0|I was slightly annoyed and rather dumfounded when first buying the \\"standard\\"(I guess that's what one would call it)edition of Flavors of Entanglement and then purchasing the deluxe edition featuring five additional tracks. When I reviewed Flavors of Entanglement only a day after it's release, I wanted to give it more than 3 stars and ended up suggesting 3 1/2 due to liking much of the CD, but there was definitely something missing the whole time, something incomplete and now I can see it was the absence of these songs. First, the original containing eleven tracks mounts to only 46 minutes and feels very short. Surely all sixteen tracks could fit on one CD, so I have to question the marketing stragedy, especially since the five additional tracks were originally chosen as part of the collection. A few months back, the track listing was changed as they were preparing for the release and the five additonal songs were taken off, and adding instead songs like \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man,\\" \\"Giggling Again For No Reason,\\" and \\"Incomplete,\\" which along with \\"Torch,\\" are the two weakest tracks(not lyrically)and should have been left for something like a bonus addition. The five tracks on this deluxe edition are all terrific songs and help complete the latest journey of self-discovery Alanis has written about. First, \\"Orchid,\\" should have been the opening song. Like \\"Citizen of the Planet,\\" \\"Orchid,\\" is very self-descriptive and has Alanis writing a snapshot of her whole journey from childhood to the present, but the wording in \\"Orchid\\" is much more poetic and not as obscure as in \\"Citizen of the Planet.\\" The perfect, mellow pop feel of \\"Orchid\\" would have served as a perfect way for Morissette to reintorduce herself. I do like \\"Citizen of the Planet,\\" and think it will sound great live, but I think it would have been best suited as one of those hidden treasures on a bonus edition. \\"The Guy Who Leaves\\" would have worked great as a contrast to \\"In Praise of the VulnerableMan,\\" and \\"Madness\\" is one of the deepest and most powerful songs Alanis has ever done, so much so that I ask what idiot at the record company felt it was more appropriate for a bonus edition. \\"Limbo No More,\\" is another great track with Alanis' emotional take as she views herself and her present circumstances, while \\"On The Tequlia\\" is the needed party track missing from the original edition. If you catch my drift, then I'm sure you know by now that buying the deluxe edition is well worth the money and will satisfy any Alanis fan.    As for what I had written in my original review, most of what I thought holds true. Morissette is autobiographical and shows her most introspective work in a long time. Her words are deeply poetic with a beautiful sense of language, very concise on her word choices with lots of powerful metaphors. Her heart and intelligence as a lyricist and songwriter are stronger than ever. Sonically, Guy Sigsworth produces a new sound for Alanis. I never thought his efforts were terrible because I did like the sound in most of the songs, but while they're good, they could be even better. Sigsworth could have pushed the envelope a little further with a little less of the swirling synthesizers at times and a little more guitar jams or even a more danceable beat. \\"Giggling Again For No Reason,\\" is a good example because it's a great tune but could have been just a little more upbeat with an extended length within the groove to create a greater feeling of freedom and bliss that's conveyed in the song. But I wouldn't dare argue with great songs like \\"Underneath,\\" in which Alanis gives us her metaphysical worldview by explaning the way we live personally plays a role in how things work globally, while \\"Versions of Violence,\\" \\"Moratorium,\\" and \\"Tapes,\\" have also become personal favorites. In Conclusion, I'm happy to say that Flavors of Entanglement is much better than 2004's dissapointing So-Called Chaos, and even happier with having listened to the additonal tracks that this release gets the higher rating it deserves. Welcome Back Alanis.
B0010X745K|3.0|The movie was great! Everything was exciting and breathtaking, until the end! NO WAY would they fight as hard as they did to stay alive, just to end it like that. Don't you think they would have waited a little longer before ending thier lives. I mean, come on!!! They run out of gas and within 5 minutes they give up!!! They could have sat there and waited. Yea, they didn't have food, but you can go a few days without food. It just wasn't believable that they fought as hard as they did to get away and then after 5 minutes decide to die! VERY upsetting ending! You didn't see it coming, but it just wasn't believable at all!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie is a must see and a must have for all you Tarantino fan. This movie to overly violent and bloody. Normally I don't like movies like that. However, it ranks among one of my favorite movies.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I have no idea how I came across the name of this group but one day I heard their new work was coming out,so I decided to read some reviews of their previous work.  In seeing the old reviews I made up my mind to purchase Third.  I have listened to the CD about 5 times and I'm impressed, my current rotation includes: EMC (The Show), N.E.R.D. (Seeing Sounds), Erykah Badu (New Amerykah), The Roots (Rising Down), Sean Price (Jesus Price Superstar), Murs/9th Wonder (Murray's Revenge), Little Brother (Get Back), DJ Shadow (Endtroducing),an occassional J-Dilla(RIP) produced album and now Portishead.  With the Hip-Hop I listen to, I can only compare the production on Third too El-P,RZA or RJD2, not only in instrumentation and song structure but also in their dark moods. Upon my first listen to Third I was like, what the heck is this, 2nd spin was like oh okay I can see where their going. Third listen and thereafter, I was sold.  I can only think of two tracks, actually maybe only one track, that I would consider fast forward material, cant remember the name(s), though.  Seeing the mixed reviews of this CD reminds me of the criticisms of Wu-Tang Forever, especially in regards to the song structure.  The female vocalist,Beth Gibbons(?) is NICE,she's used like Blue Rasberry, for those of you who own Only Built for Cuban Linx, listen to Rainy Dayz, that's the first comparison that comes to mind, Blue's vibe on that song is Beth's vibe for all of Third.  I dont wanna get too long winded, so let me wrap up by saying that if you are into anyone that I mentioned, I would recommend Third, if you've never heard of anyone I mentioned above, give 'em a try. Lastly, I WILL be buying previous releases, by Portishead, nuff said.

0953104907|3.0|This is quite an informative book for a beginner electric guitar or other electric instrument maker. There are three chapters which follow the course of making two guitars and a bass, and different neck/ body constructions are covered pretty well through these instructional examples. Different techniques for different applications are examined. I think the structure could be more logical and progressive for this book, but it's not a major detraction. I think that there could be a more fundamental analysis of constructing a guitar rather than basing the work on traditional and contemporary practices. In this way guitar makers could come up with there own ideas and approaches, but overall it's a good book in a subject area that seems pretty scant for want of information. Also sometimes the author is a little misleading for the sake of telling a joke, for instance about 'bashing in' frets. It could be edited better.
B00177Y9ZM|2.0|Yet another movie that ended with everyone in the room being bored.  There were four of us watching this last weekend, and only 3 remained conscious until the end... of those 3 all of us kind of shrugged and one said \\"well that was certainly another ho-hum movie.\\"<br /><br />None of us had read the book or graphic novel that this was based off of.  Perhaps if we had then we would have enjoyed it more.  When the movie started up with the voice over I knew we were in trouble.  Very few \\"good\\" movies have VO's (Christmas Story is a good one, Trainspotting another.)  VO's generally tell you that \\"we can't write a good script so we're going to have some guy tell you what you're supposed to know.\\"  I tried to ignore the VO and give the movie a chance... then we were treated to excellent actors forgetting to act.  They were all very stiff, wooden, and clich&eacute;d.  Samuel L Jackson looked absolutely ridiculous with his white hair and tazer-club.  When the plot was supposed to shift into high gear... nothing was explained.  Okay so the bad guys were called \\"Paladins\\" and had been killing \\"Jumpers\\" since forever because they were too powerful.  Um... okay.  Too bad the \\"Jumpers\\" in this movie never really acted like good guys.  I didn't particularly care who lived or died... in fact I would have been much happier had they all died.<br /><br />So let's forget about the lack of a good script, plot holes, and bad acting.  What about the SFX?  Some of them were quite good, and some of them were Sci-Fi channel special quality.  Some of it was ingenious and some of it was garbage, but there was little consistency to what we saw and when.  Sometimes when he jumped, the buildings shook and the walls cracked... other times he was able to hop all over the place without making a sound.<br /><br />All I know is that by the time the final battle came around we were all ready for this to be over.  Jumper has been one in a long string of Yawn-worthy movies we have rented as of late.  I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Sorry but it was just lacking in so many areas, and it wasn't even bad enough to be funny.to anyone.  Sorry but it was just lacking in so many areas, and it wasn't even bad enough to be funny.
B00081U6EG|2.0|When my brother sent me this DVD, I was really excited about getting the player open and putting this in and watching it. Boy, was I surprised.<br />I wasn't so disappointed in the performances, I am like California Man, and was hoping to see Strat people! Not Amy freakin' Whinehouse, hearing Rod Stewart music and listening to an audience sing to BOTH of Paul Roger's signature songs.<br />I have to wonder if the Producers and the Staff are even old enough to be putting together a show of this caliber. Right or wrong, the people there are NOT the quint essential musicians representatives of the greatness and the beauty of the Fender guitars.<br />I won't go on and on about how much I don't like the DVD...we're all grown people and when there's a cast like THIS, for the 50th celebration of a musical instrument like the Strat, we can all assume that someone made a LOT of money somewhere.<br />The whole concert was done very substandard and hardly ANYONE got introduced....very unprofessional.<br />I must say that if that production company needs a good graphix artist, I can be bought....just fly me to LA.

044024238X|4.0|When I first picked up this book, my expectations were low. I wanted a quick, witty, predictable read, which wouldn't strain my brain, and allow me to indulge in a little down-time.<br />Well, The Undomestic Goddess proved to be both quick and witty, but definitely not predictable.<br />The plot is simple enough - 29 year-old Samantha has lost her job as a high-powered lawyer, due to a rather unfortunate mistake she has made in the office. And so to escape her past, Samantha disappears off into the country, to take up the role as housekeeper for an affluent English couple. The only problem is that Samantha has claimed to be a cordon bleu chef, when if fact, she knows absolutely nothing about cooking or housekeeping. Mayhem ensues as Samatha tries to work out how to prepare more than just toast, while trying to hide her previous identity as a lawyer.<br />The Undomestic Goddess could have been a predictable fairy-tale read for adults, but somehow, Sophie Kinsella has managed to make this story plausible, by adding some fascinating little twists to the plot. Kinsella has also created an endearing character in Samantha, who is struggling, like every other woman, to balance her priorities in life.<br /><br />The Undomestic Goddess is a great summer read that is fun, clever and highly entertaining.<br /><br />Zara Stevens<br />[[ASIN:141967787X Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories]]

Our medical system is an absolute disgrace.<br /><br />The film does an excellent job of focusing on what the problem(s) are but is a little weak on proposing solutions. With that said I think every single one of our elected representatives and government officials should be required to watch this film, the problem is real and has to be addressed urgently. Michael Moore has done a great service by focusing the debate, it's an important first step.

The rest of the songs are pretty ghetto sounding, I think Rhianna needs to step it up and do more dance music like Madonna did on \\"Hard Candy\\".  The ghetto thang is gettin' old.  The song \\"Good Gurl Gone Bad\\" had potential, but it needed better vocals and a better beat.  That being said, I hope Rhianna's next release has a fresh new beat that we've never heard b4.

B0001I561E|4.0|Aladdin is definately one of the best Disney movies.  However, all of these added \\"special features\\" that drive up the cost of the DVD and dub it \\"platinum\\" are completely unnecessary.

0786948523|5.0|I've already reviewed the core rules book set and it recieved my and my players mark of approval. The game plays great. So now I've decided to look at each book individually and judge them. I was surprised to log onto amazon and see that this edition of the MM has garnered only a two star rating. The only reason i can see for this is the fact that so many people are rating the book badly because they haven't even attempted to play with the new 4th edition rules. People tend to hate change as they did when 3rd edition came out. In  other words despite my skepticism when the edition was announced i played it and loved the new ruleset. Is it 3.5? nope and it shouldn't be its a new edition afterall. 3.5 is still there for everyone to play and Paizo publishing will still put out new stuff for it for awhile at least. That being said, what do i think of the Monster Manual for the newest edition? It works great. Its not as bare bones as most of the reviewers on here will lead you to believe. However, it doesn't feature the extensive writeups of the previous edition. Although most of those said writeups had a few paragraphs of background info then abilities and tactics for the monsters made up the rest. This is a new format and you can still get just as much info out of it and it is easier to read. Now does it go into complete depth on every entry about the species origin and societies? It has DC for knowledge checks to learn the important details of each species so I would say yes sorta. Its  a Monsters manual not a book on species afterall. It has enough info to use the monsters effectively in your game and roleplay them effectively. Each entry also has several different types as well as encounter groups you can drop into your campaign. In other words the Monster Manual does just what its supposed to do. It gives the dm monsters to use in their campaigns and makes it easier for them to do so. So I ask, Why all the hate for 4th edition. Sheesh, give it a shot guys don't blast it without playing it.     My only real complaint is the section on using monster races as characters. Not enough rules or info here to make them viable races. Some of their monster powers are overpowered compared to other racial abilities and there are no racial feats listed so its really a haphazard attempt to add more pc races. However, with a little tweaking they are still usable.

0385340567|3.0|I love the Jack Reacher series and have even preordered them knowing they would be good.  I didn't enjoy the previous book and didn't enjoy this one.  Something is missing from the Jack Reacher of old.  I think what appealed to me about the earlier books was that we saw different sides of Jack Reacher and also learned more and more about his earlier life as the series went on.  We learned nothing new in this book.  I would say it is a stand alone. As others have mentioned, the political statement was surprising. I hope Lee can figure it out by the next book or I won't be willing to blindly order his books in hardcover.
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|There's something so cruel about Roman Polanski's \\"Ninth Gate\\", something so mean underneath the surface, that though it isn't always a frightening film, it certainly ranks up there with some of the more campy and direct movies about Old Scratch.<br /><br />Unlike \\"The Pianist\\" or some of Polanski's more recent mainstream films, this makes no direct attempt to spoonfeed the viewer the meaning or message of the film.  For all the eccentricity, though--and there's plenty of it--this actually isn't too tough to figure out.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a lowlife rare book collector who, like everyone else in the film, wants what he wants when he wants it.  He is a dry, ironic, cynical intellectual whose dominant personality trait is his ego and desire for money.  Depp's performance is amazing despite how little he is given to work with; the laughs never stop as his curt, smartass responses to every question asked flow like a bilious current.<br />Contracted by a power hungry devotee of the Black Arts (Frank Langella in one of his ugliest and most frightening roles) Boris Balkan, his mission is to find an authentic copy of a book called \\"The Ninth Gate\\", a text  which supposedly leads directly to the presence and power of Satan himself.<br /><br />Here the mad surreality and black humor begin.  It resembles very closely Roman Polanski's 1976 film \\"The Tenant\\", except this film has an almost complete absence of protagonists or decent characters at all.  Everyone is more less a degenerate. During Corso's ominous escapades and his encounters with thoroughly sinister and foul people (all of whom die when Balkan discovers that they are not cooperating with Corso's search, leading one to believe he is indeed the Devil), a young woman who looks like a raggedy college student follows him constantly.  At first she appears merely scary and irritating, like everyone else in this doomed, musty landscape: when Corso is physically attacked, however, we realize she is not an agent of Balkan's or a college student.  She displays supernatural powers and yet she reacts to the constant deaths that occur with a kind of attentiveness towards Corso's reactions, looking for guilt or disgust and finding none--and she seems pleased.<br /><br />The ending of the movie is so funny and so filthy at the same time that we know Polanski is refusing to compromise one little bit.  Corso, at first a neutral amoral character, becomes obsessed with his quest for the book and gets in Balkan's way--his ending is particularly hilarious.  Polanski also takes a shot at Satanists, as Balkan exclaims to a crowd of them, dressed in pentagrams and black robes: \\"Do you really think the Prince of Darkness would manifest himself in the midst of this nonsense?\\"<br /><br />A good look at Corso's \\"Guardian Angel\\" at the end reveals just who she is and what her true intentions were the whole time.  I'm not going to reveal what happens, but I am surprised so many viewers were \\"dumbfounded\\" by this movie.  A great exercise in Polanskian madness!llege student.

I'm not going to reveal what happens, but I am surprised so many viewers were \\"dumbfounded\\" by this movie.  A great exercise in Polanskian madness!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|For $109, this is a great deal. It looks like the exact same copy I saw at Target and Borders for $$199. I didn't care even if this didn't came with the free movie ticket. It is a complete set encased in a pink suede album. It is very elegant and it truly represents Sex and the City. I can not express my joy for buying this just in time. I can't say it is worth it for $199 but it is a steal for $109!
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I loved this movie. Interesting, action-packed, funny. Until I saw the ending. Its a good thing I didn't see this in theaters because I don't think other people would've appreciated me yelling \\"Nooo!\\"
B0015GF4FO|5.0|\\"In Treatment\\" is, by far, the greatest series HBO has put out. I am a huge fan of the other series, but this is truly spectacular. I do not have the DVD set as of yet, but I have watched the entire series when it aired. The acting is superb. Anyone whom has experienced good therapy should agree, it is as if you are sitting in on the sessions four days a week, and on the fifth to view the therapist therapy, is intriguing. It is as intense as it is wonderful. What a great thing to experience.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|OK, as I just said, I'm going to step on some toes because it appears to me that aside from one other person, I am the only one with a concience.  The whole storyline is wrong, let's just start with that.  I know that there was a time when people thought like that (give my daughter to so-and-so and hope that it'll help me climb the social ladder), but why would we want to promote this type of behavior and make it have some sort of appeal to it?  I think that the acting was amazing and the costumes were excellent, but that is all I have good to say about the film.  And when did it become alright to have a rape in a PG-13 movie?!  Someone please answer that for me!!  I rented this film because, yes, I was intrigued by the story, but usually when there is something like rape in a film, it is usually mentioned in the tiny box that explains why the film is rated what it is.  You will not find the word \\"rape\\" anywhere on that box, not even \\"strong sexuallity,\\" just sexuality.  When the film was over, I was scratching my head over several things: why did Henry go back on his word and execute Anne anyway and not even have the guts to explain it in person to Mary?  Why did the makers of this film try to leave you feeling sorry for Anne when Mary was the one who suffered in every way imaginable and then return to stand by her sister?  Why do we want to watch these things, but then we never want to mention in public that we did watch it?  And finally, why do we watch things like this, and when we go to write reviews about them on the internet, we never mention the disgusting and nauseating rape or rapes that we see in them?  All I can say now is that I am in desperate need of a shower with a lot of soap, and it's not because I played in mud.  (Spiritual mud, maybe.)
B000LE1GVW|4.0|I decided to buy this CD after hearing the catchy \\"Jenny Don't Be Hasty\\" track on Sirius Spectrum. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find a really great collection of songs. Several of the tracks reminded me of another of my favorite CDs, \\"Long Time Coming\\" by Jonny Lang. Nutini's vocals on a couple of the tracks even sound like they could have been sang by Lang. I am not at all a blues fan but this CD seems to mix in just enough of a blues element to separate it from the run-of-the-mill male pop/rock acts that seem to dominate commercial radio.
B00005JNEI|1.0|If you don't care about the actual truth, enjoy!  However, if you are one of those people who can compare different accounts, examine historical evidence and make reasonable judgements, watch Fahrenheit 9/11, watch FahrenHYPE 9/11, and do your own research.  If you're capable of reaching reasonable conclusions, you'll see the twisted-truth propagated by Moore, the wild speculation (without any reasonable supporting evidence), his profiteering from this film and the fact that his film should be located under Fiction rather than Documentary.  What he presents as FACT is an insult to an educated American society.  Watch the films, do your own research and decide for yourself.
B0000542D2|5.0|Before there was Truth or Dare-Madonna, there was a Hard Day's Night.  Based on the observations of the Beatles real lives with a bit of plot thrown in, this fun little movie has some great lines and wonderful songs.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I love the older versions of this bizarre tale, so I wasn't sure I'd like this one, but it's wonderful.  A dark comedy with fitting music and quick action that keeps your attention.  Though the story is a bit morbid, it is certainly entertaining.  A great cast was chosen for this re-make. Depp and Helena Bonham Carter worked well together.  Depp plays the mad barber set on revenge and Helena is delightful as the frumpy pie shop owner who is dedicated and intent on keeping Sweeney Todd for herself, though she knows his love is saved for his daughter and lost wife. Can't help but feel a little sorry for both characters.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
0525950079|5.0|This is a great read. It is one of those books that you can't put down. The ordering experience was great and i recieved the book very quickly.
B0000640VO|5.0|Great movie. I enjoy watching it over and over for the artistic expression.  You will have to pay attention to the English subtitles for a while, but after that it is is just great.<br /><br />The music is fantastic.  I bought the soundtrack and I enjoy it all of the time!  You will find people playing the music on You Tube which is very entertaining.  Check it out :)<br /><br />Update:  I have seen this movie several times since I got the DVD, and I like it so much it is on top of my list of favorite movies.  Some people I know did not appreciate the artistic fantasy type of movie it was.  Some felt the female lead, Audrey Tautou, wasn't a strong character and she goes through life only to be interested in a non-leading type of a guy.  I think they missed the point because the female leads goes through a growing process and it is an adventure.<br /><br />I have since watched many Audrey Tautou pictures and I found her acting wonderful and she carries a good acting range of ability in portraying different characters, and that this movie was just one role in which she was certainly very entertaining. This is one is my favorite movies staring Audrey Tautou.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This was one of those rare truly adult fairytales for us grown-ups that just don't want to grow up.    It is a challenging story of a young man who is intrigued about a wall that is outside his town.  There is a break in the wall and a wall keeper guards the wall, so no one passes on to the other side.  As far as he can see, the other side has fields just like his side.  One day he ventures over the wall, after traveling for a bit, he comes to a very odd town.  He meets a princess that is held prisoner by a witch, who invites him into her caravan wagon.  He than goes home.  Nine months later a little bundle is delivered to his door step. His son.  He raises the boy. The real story starts when the boy becomes of age, and he goes to find his true love.  He too ventures over the wall, and has a wonderful adventure.
0767834739|4.0|This second in the trilogy is good, but as many of my friends warned me, not as good as the first.  You have the zombies, demon dogs, etc. as well as a monster who has 'very familiar eyes', but it seems a little dark and shadowy, which seems to rob it of some intensity. It feels more spooky than action packed. Perhaps because they're still stuck in the city fighting in and out of the buildings it just seems too cramped, and too much like the first. I did like it though and it's good enough to stand on its own without watching the first in the series.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This is really great!! It was quick and easy to get the DVD and it was brand new. Great experience.
0061139378|5.0|Coraline is a kid. That obvious truth struck me many times throughout this amazing little gem by Neil Gaiman of \\"American Gods\\" fame. Not to blunt my praise for Gaiman's creative ability, but he MUST have drawn on his parenting experiences for \\"Coraline.\\" The titular character is equal parts charmingly honest and frusteratingly picky, she styles herself as independent but her world is bordered by the arms of her parents. People will inevitably compare this book to \\"Alice and Wonderland,\\" but Coraline (not Caroline, mind you) is not a moralizing avatar of the author. She is a self-styled explorer that any kid (boy or girl) could easily get behind.<br /><br />That's not to say that Gaiman's only triumph is creating a single great character. The narrative has a unique way of causing fear that I've honestly never seen before. To all but the most sensitive children \\"Coraline\\" is a great spooky tale to tell kids old enough to understand the concept of fiction. (anyone reading Goosebumps or other kid-friendly thrillers) Adults, specifically parents, may feel a different kind of fear as Coraline enters a very twisted version of her own home. It may even be more terrifying to a parent that, at it's heart, \\"Coraline\\" is a story about a young girl that is kidnapped by a hostile and even murderous force.<br /><br />To go into setting and the other plot details would destroy a lot of the suspense that mounts as Coraline explores her new world. It's best that the reader encounters them as Coraline does: brave and horrified. However, it is worth noting that this isn't a story aimed at seeing the child-hero through to adulthood. It's not a innocence-crushing coming of age tale. If anything the journey makes Coraline just a bit more grateful for what she has, and that's a lesson that any kid can take to heart.<br /><br />If this were just an excellent piece of children's fiction it would easily deserve five stars. As it is a delightful read for any age it should be purchased immeadiately for anyone even slighlty interested in the sort of surreal fairy tale that Gaiman has mastered writing.ighlty interested in the sort of surreal fairy tale that Gaiman has mastered writing.
0375714669|1.0|I loved Persepolis, so when I realized there was a Persepolis 2, I quickly bought a used copy from Amazon. When I received it, I was very disappointed to learn that I had already read it! Although my first book was entitled Persepolis, it contained both stories. Check your copy of Persepolis before you buy the sequel; you may have read it!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Okay... The year is only halfway over, but if I were a betting man, I would bet this is going to be the best album this year come December.     Fleet Foxes is not the type of musical act I would normally listen to. I only purveyed this album because so many musical sources were drinking the Fleet Foxes Kool-Aid. But alas, the critical acclaim is warranted! ...for once.    Not being a fan of this genre, I couldn't really tell you why I liked it without sounding ignorant. But I do know what I like and... I like this album... a lot.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|My first Bob Dylan CD was a Greatest Hits compilation which introduced me to the Bob Dylan of late (Things Have Changed, Summer Days, Feel My Love, etc).  After hearing those songs, I knew I had to get Time Out of Mind, Love and Theft and Modern Times.  Love and Theft is the only CD I haven't gotten yet.    Modern Times, for the most part, at first seemed a tad slow, if you will.  But like a lot of Dylan's material, the more you listen, the more you pick up and begin to appreciate it.  I wouldn't put it up there side by side with Time Out of Mind, but it is a close second.    Dylan's voice is definitely in the \\"gravel\\" catagory, but that makes this material work in my opinion.  Coupled with the great music, the songs would never sound as good with a \\"clean\\"-voiced singer.    I got the special edition with the DVD.  Love the videos.  The Grammy performance of Lovesick is second to none.  I didn't catch it at first, but the Things Have Changed video doesn't include the second verse of the album song..\\"This place ain't doing me any good...\\"  Disappointing.    All in all, this is one of Dylan's best.  My kids can't stand it which makes it all the better to me!!
B0017V7GLC|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying that pre-Velocifero I considered myself just a casual Ladytron fan. 604, Light & Magic, and Witching Hour were decent albums to be sure, but they weren't albums I could see myself playing over other albums in my collection. *This is often a dilemma when one owns a lot of music.     In early May, my friends told me they were going to see Ladytron at the Henry Fonda in Hollywood and they wanted me to go. Once again, being just a casual Ladytron fan I wasn't too excited about the prospect of seeing them live. But then I found out that Datarock was in the line-up and that was all the motivation I needed.     At that time I had no idea that Ladytron was releasing a new album. Obviously, it makes sense that they would go on tour with the pending release of a new album, but I didn't put 1+1 together at the time. Consequently, I went to this concert with no knowledge of their new album. And looking back, that was a good thing.     I'm just going to lay it all out right here... Ladytron blew me away. Seriously, they were without a doubt one of the best live acts I've ever seen... and I've seen dozens of live Indie acts. Ladytron is a band one needs to see live to really understand and appreciate. They recreated every digital sound with a live instrument. And their theatrics, lighting, and showmanship were some of the best in the business.     Now, onto the album... Velocifero is by far my favorite Ladytron album. To me it's the perfect hybrid of Light & Magic and Witching Hour. It's that Ladytron album I've been waiting for. But since I saw most of the songs performed live before I heard the album, Velocifero has a special place in my heart. Even still, after seeing songs from 604, Light & Magic, and Witching Hour performed live, I now view those albums with the utmost respect. It's eerie the way that concert completely changed the way I hear Ladytron.     I mean, they are all the same albums, right? The difference is that now all of themare on regular rotation in my car and on my iPod. See you next time you're in LA, Ladytron!
B000669GAI|4.0|This was the first Pearl Jam CD I have ever purchased.  I am 43 years old, so Pearl Jam was getting famous while I was in my late 20s.  I liked Alive when it first came out, but I kind of lost track of the band after that.      Now, I am starting to re-visit music from my past due to all the crap (for the most part) that is produced today.  This double CD rocks.  I love it.  I use it to work out to and it is great \\"driving\\" music.  The majority of the songs I had never heard before since I didn't really follow the band in the past, but there isn't one song on this I can't listen to without doing some air guitar somewhere on the track.    I am very pleased with this purchase, and for a double CD, it was a steal through Amazon.  I found it several dollars higher at a big box store.    Like I have said on another review I did for a Bob Dylan CD, three of my four kids don't like it (my 17 year old son isn't repulsed by it) which makes it sound much better to me.
B00139XZF4|4.0|This is a very pretty and decently original work of fantasy.  I have not read the books, so I cannot comment weather of not the movie was true to the books or at least able to capture the overall story.<br /><br />The story did seem rushed.  I felt like I was missing a lot information, as the movie fails to establish certain mythos before we are throw kicking and screaming into the major plot points.  For this, it looses a star.<br /><br />Protip: Rent this before you buy it.<br /><br />As an aside, try to pay little attention to the tin-foil hat psychos that want to imply metaphors and similes that simply are not there.  I find it endlessly amusing that these people will imply almost anything (though they like to attach politics and religion to EVERYTHING to improve shock value) to simple fantasy films, yet will fail to see the blatant similes of films like The Wizard of OZ.  Bottom line, make your own decision and try to ignore them... which most of you will.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|I had read somewhere that this has few if any different extra features when compared to previous editions.  That might be true, but since I didn't have those and this was the most current edition, I am just fine with the extras. I am also just fine with a classic modern thriller told as a fish-tale.
0156027321|1.0|Life of Pi...   I heard so many wonderful comments about this book that it baffles me how seemingly intelligent people can recommend this poorly written story.     The author has no regard for reality, if one really wants to learn about survival at sea, then I highly recommend ADRIFT by Steven Callahan, who actually survived 76 days at sea.    Life of Pi is full of unnecessary gore, tedius explanations and ubnoxious narration.    Save your money. Life of Pi is a waste of paper, ink, and moreover, precious time.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|Good parts: new Bond is OK, very physical and relatively pleasant, the pictures and supporting cast are great, stunts are simply great. The Obanno's attack is a very refreshing move and in my view the best episode of the movie.    Bad parts:    1. Bond girls are not up to the level set in the previous Bond movies and in all cases mutual attraction looks very unnatural.    2. One hundred million dollars moment: governments do not care that much about $15 mln. anymore.    3. The plot is annoyingly weak: e.g. the bad guy does not have his own crew capable of minor bombing etc etc.

B00110K62U|4.0|I love Les Miserables.... it's my favorite fictional story ever told. i love the musical even more. The music was so inspired and keeps you singing the tunes for days...weeks... even years after hearing it.     The musical is great that being said I don't understand why they would market it in the concert format. As good as the music is by itself it's even better to have the actions etc along with it.  I've been hoping for ten years for them to bring the full musical to DVD and it looks like I'll still be waiting for what I really want.

B0017KP93U|5.0|This is going to be an 'Indiana Jones 4' of on an album, you're either going to love it or hate it.<br /><br />Its a great compilation of their best songs, the order is interesting, but any Radiohead fan will already have the majority of these tracks. Its just on one handy CD. For the newbies to Radiohead it's a great listen.<br /><br />Yes, it's an EMI cash in since the band have left the label. All the classics are on disc one, the 2 Disc edition I would recommend, as it holds some of the more offbeat tracks and gives you more of a rounded impression of their music.<br /><br />An alternative though would be to buy the Limited Edition Box Set and get them in all their glory, that's minus 'In Rainbows' mind.<br /><br />This is getting 5 stars for the music.
1416914285|5.0|I was a little wary when I picked this book up because it looked like it would be a lot like a fairy tale, but I loved it. It is dark and heavy at some parts, but the characters have wonderful humor and sarcasm and can always keep the story moving. Once I started I had a hard time putting this book down, what with all the action and suspense and cool creatures that kept appearing. It reminds me of Holly Black's books, so if you like her books (Tithe, Valiant, and Ironside) you will probably like Cassandra Clare's. Clare's are not as dark, which is nice, and have some really great sarcastic and humorous characters. I would definitely recommend this book to teens.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|What is Will Smith doing in a remake of the old cult movie, \\"The Night of the Living Dead?  Years ago my son and I got hooked watching the old one and laughed all the way through it.     But, why is Will Smith in a remake with lots of computer enhancement which does not make the movie any better? (The first one looked like it was filmed in someone's garage)  Parts of this movie looks like the computer work which was done in a documentary on what the earth would look like if man disappeared.     I am a fan of the fine work which Will has done but this does not reflect any of the movies he has made.  If you are under 20 years of age, you will probably love this; if you are over 20, don't bother with it.

B000W1V5VU|2.0|Look, I know these movies are stupid vanity projects, but I really enjoyed Oceans 11 and 12, the guys seemed to be having fun and it was light(and I do mean light)entertainment, but this one is just lazy and nobody seems to be having the least amount of fun, the least of which is the audience.  I mean Pitt keeps looking at his watch as if to say, shouldnt I be picking up Angela's teddy from the dry cleaner?  Really, all of the actors in this film should be ashamed to cash their hefty checks, this is totally mailed in.  Pacino is totally wasted and the plot, as if their ever really is one in these stupid movies, is totally convoluted, I mean what the f is Eddie Lizzard even talking about, you shouldnt need a degree in macro physics to figure out a movie plot.  I dont recommend this movie in the least, frankly id like the two hours of my life back wasted on this inane tripe.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|Very quickly...  You get a TON of music for the price when the singers were in their prime!!  The quality of the dvd is ok.  Convienence is not so much if you dont like all the bands.  There are a lot of parts of the dvd where the sound squeals because of the sound set up on stage not due to the dvd, which is annoying.    Overall, worth purchasing if you are an absolute fan of the 80's!!
B00000AFGM|5.0|Mechanical Animals wasn't my first Manson albums and aside from the radio/MTV tracks & videos, I really didn't get too much out of it when it first came out. It was okay, had some catchy tunes and I didn't dislike it, but it never quite felt the way I thought a Marilyn Manson album should. I've noticed a great many people I've known who otherwise dislike Manson enjoyed this album. Probably because the high concentration of pop-oriented tunes fit closer to what they're used to hearing. That's great, but if they were paying attention to what the lyrics are actually SAYING they might not feel the same way. It's pretty much a rocket-propelled glam grenade aimed straight at the music industry and all those who play in its shadows.    Of course, I have to admit that I myself had not paid very close attention to the lyrics until recently. Once a friend opened my eyes to the depth the tracks actually offer aside from their catchy hooks and choruses, I began to appreciate this album more. Songs like 'Speed of Pain' and 'User Friendly' show the same trademark Manson social commentary and introspection that's prevalent in all his other albums. What's different here is the experimental core. David Bowie had Ziggy Stardust and Marilyn Manson has two characters to offer: Alpha (a version of himself) and Omega (pronounced like Oh-ME-Gah), an android-like alien. Despite what you may have heard Manson did not receive a boob job for this cover, nor has he personally ordered any school shootings. Whew, right?    Anyways, there's plenty of creativity here for both your eyes (the album cover) and your ears. If you play it in rotation with Antichrist Superstar you can get a great deal more out of it story-wise. Yes, there is a story told in these songs. It's part fiction and part auto-biography. Just like Marilyn Manson created itself for. :)
B00004TXFX|5.0|I was never the biggest fan of the band, but once seeing this performance, I am now hooked. I won't go into the dynamics of the quality of the dvd, music, etc. I bought it for my husband for Christmas. But I watched it and it is superb! There is a section in the performance that the singer forgets the song, but that to me is what LIVE is all about. It makes the performance even better! This is the best 'chill out' music to put on. Fantastic.
B000SZLSB2|1.0|This guy is just awful! His voice is way too nasal. The music is too simple, and the style so sweet it makes me sick. Sorry guys! There are so many good artists out there that does not get playtime in the radio, and they deserves it more than mr./mrs. Blunt here. For instance You should try Peter Mayer (Green Eyed Radio or Musicbox), if You like soft music. He has a better voice, and he is a better musician IMO.

0321525655|5.0|I've been doing public speaking for twenty-five years, and teaching before that, and I'd guess that I've created hundreds of Powerpoint presentations. But I still gained some great insight into alternative approaches for using Powerpoint from this book.<br /><br />If you're an advocate of simplicity, this book will resonate with you. It doesn't tell you exactly what to do, or even give you a process (as [[ASIN:0735620520 Beyond Bullet Points: Using Microsoft  PowerPoint  to Create Presentations That Inform, Motivate, and Inspire (Bpg-Other)]] does). However, I found that Presentation Zen was much more thought-provoking, and it affected my presentation style much more than Beyond Bullet Points. It has a generous number of examples taken from real presentations, and these really help. It's approach of \\"here's a typical prosaic way, and here are some better ways\\" will make you unsatisfied with traditional, boring Powerpoint slides.<br /><br />It also delves into using Powerpoint as a supporting tool rather than as the central focus of your presentation, and goes beyond Powerpoint into the finer points of presenting. The last section named \\"delivery\\" contains two chapters: \\"The Art of Being Completely Present\\" and \\"Connecting with an Audience\\". They don't really talk about Powerpoint at all (except for some comments on using a slide clicker), instead concentrating on helping you to focus on what's important - making a presentation a good experience for both you and your audience.<br /><br />The style and philosophy presented work especially well for presentations in which the primary purpose is persuasion. I don't think presenters of technical material (which is what I do) need to dogmatically adopt all of the techniques in this book. But even a technical presentation needs introductory material on why the presentation is important. The audience must be persuaded of that before they'll even pay attention.<br /><br />I've bought two of these for colleagues, one an experienced presenter in sales/marketing/promotion, and one just starting out in technical presentation. I believe it will help both.ing/promotion, and one just starting out in technical presentation. I believe it will help both.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Emmylou is a master at delivering songs by other writers as if they were her  own. Eventhough this project features songs by Patty Griffin, Tracy Chapman, Merle Haggard and Billy Joe Shaver, it is the relatively unknown singer-songwriter Jude Johnstone's song \\"Hold On,\\" that stands out for me. Emmylou's passionate vocals are haunting. \\"Hold On\\" is simply breathtaking.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The DVD is really great, I saw John Adams on HBO early this spring and I when nuts over the movie. The whole cast is really great I hope Paul Glamatti and Laura Linney  get an emmy for John Adams. I didn't know every much about John Adams until I saw it on HBO. And the scenes at Williamsburg were just great. I been two or three its a great place to go. I can't wait until 1776 comes out. I read the book and it is really good, so is John Adam s book!! I'm looking for more books on history period time. I loved the 1700's!!!!
0805209999|5.0|Block, the painter, and Leni among others, are strangers who understand the complications of Joseph K's case as well as the details of court operations.  The story exist in a state of total chaos, characters come and go for no clear reason, out of the blue, women go crazy over Joseph and then changing on him for no reason, People show concern for him and then become completely indifferent to his plight and an accusation , that he doesn't understand, is made. Joseph doesn't know if it's a crazy nightmare or reality.<br /><br />The court that has access to any information or place at any time and holds the divine authority to decide everybody's destiny, still conducts its business in weird, dark and suspicious places. Is the court a symbol of the unaccountable bureaucracy that Kafka witnessed or was it the inner world of alienation that Kafka experienced all of his life? Was the first building that Joseph went to for the first court meeting merely a strange, empty, dark place or was it a maze that symbolizes a corrupt society?<br /><br />When the prison chaplain comments: \\"...it is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary\\", did he refer to the corrupted legal system or to the crazy world as Kafka saw it?<br /><br />What does Fraulein Burstner symbolize in Joseph's life? What is the significance of her sudden vague appearance at the end? was she the last connection to life in Joseph's eyes?<br /><br />Why didn't Joseph fight the two men at the end? Had he given up and wanted to end his emotional torment or was it his longing to discover the ultimate truth?<br /><br />As is typical of Kafka's works, there are many unanswered questions, but the journey through his works is outstanding and complex. It isn't called Kafkaesque for nothing.<br /><br />unlike critics who would say that this novel was never finished, I believe that Kafka finished this novel and made the characters and events as random and confusing as possible.  Reading the Trial, another Kafka masterpiece, is certainly time well spent.inly time well spent.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Even though we're at the halfway point of the year, 2008 may go down as \\"The Year of the Boomer,\\" what with major releases from \\"seniors\\" like Madonna, Sergio Mendes, Al Green, Dolly Parton and septuagenarian Dame Shirley Bassey, all being well-received by critics and fans alike.<br /><br />To the fray we can now add Donna Summer with \\"Crayons,\\" a welcome addition to the singer's discography of hits and an ear-friendly hodgepodge for those of us that have loved the singer since \\"Love to Love You Baby\\" hit the airwaves three decades ago.<br /><br />The new release, featuring twelve songs co-written by Summer and a variety of songwriters, allows the singer to poke fun at herself and celebrity (\\"The Queen is Back\\" and \\"Fame-the Game\\"), as well as hurl herself headlong into contemporary dance grooves with tunes like the tile cut and \\"Mr. Music.\\" Summer gets a little nostalgic with the retro-disco sound on \\"I'm a Fire,\\" waxes country with \\"Slide Over Backwards,\\" and plays with a South American sound with \\"Drivin' Down Brazil.\\"<br /><br />The slower, mid-tempo numbers are just as good. \\"Sand on My Feet,\\" \\"Science of Love,\\" \\"Be Myself Again,\\" and \\"Bring Down the Reign\\" allow Summer to show her softer yet highly effective vocals, something that she occasionally did on such classics as her concept \\"Bad Girls\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time\\" albums from the 70's.<br /><br />Though some may call \\"Crayons\\" a comeback, I prefer to think of it as a \\"rebirth\\" to her minions of fans worldwide, as well as an \\"introduction\\" to the younger listeners that weren't fortunate to have experienced the \\"Queen of Disco\\" in her heyday.<br /><br />Either way, both audiophiles will be pleased with this FIVE-STAR recording.
1423101464|5.0|This book is so good i loved reading it! The only thing different would be that when percy is saying goodbye to annabeth at the end before he leaves camp he should have kissed her! But i would totally tell anyone to read this series if they wanted to know if it was any good!

B000YABYLA|3.0|Juno is a sweet enough film despite the subject matter. However, it is not really cliché as far as films like this go. There is no question about what exactly Juno wants to do with the baby, there is no obnoxious babbling regretful baby daddy or angry pissed off parents. It feels different than all those other films. Ellen Page is perfect for this role. She is barely even acting, its like watching someone in real life. She is what makes this film work. There are sweet tender moments and comedic parts as well. I couldn't help getting a tad teary-eyed at times. As far as all the praise it got during awards season, that was a bit too much in my estimation. It is a cute enough film, just nothing spectacular or terribly unique.
B000Y35A94|4.0|First of all let me start by saying that I seen Genesis Live in Auburn Hills Mi. It was a great show both in sound quality and visual production. This DVD recreates the event. Stunning picture qulity combined with the great stage show makes this DVD a pleasure to watch. The sound qulity is excellent as well. This DVD is worth every penny of the 20.00 I paid for it at Walmarts. Now to the downsides. Watching Phil stumble around reading Italian from a sheet of paper takes away from the show. Translate the English into Italian on the Huge screen behind the stage would have been much better. Secondly This is a live concert in front of 100,000 people. They either washed out all the cheering crowd or 100,000 Italians don't make a lot of noise. Lastly I wished they would have made use of multiple camera angles as they did on The Way We Walk Concert. It would have been so much better. THere were so many cool camera angles in this DVD however you only got seconds to actually enjoy them before they switched to a different one. That is probibly the biggest disappointment with this DVD. All in all I still give it 4 stars.
B0000844I8|4.0|In the beginning, there was only one Stargate movie and it was a step into another dimension of watching movies. Collecting all of Stargates movies has been a great hobby, for myself but also for my nephews, nieces, brothers, sisters and friends. Getting together for &#34;Stargate Parties&#34; to watch and enjoy all of these movies, but especially the first one has been a great celebration that we can do as often as we wish to. I highly recommend Stargate to all that don't have it, as the first stars are as different as the stars of the movies that followed.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|From the moment the silhouette of that famous fedora crosses the screen, you'll feel that old surge of movie-house giddiness that you felt the first time you went to a darkened theater to see [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark]]. Indy is older...a bit greyer and a bit creakier, but he still has a killer smile and a rapier wit to go with that twinkle in his eye. So when the nasty Ruskies (the Cold War now replacing WWI) kidnap Indy and take him to Area 51, the thrill ride kicks in almost from the very start to the sounds of Elvis Presley and John Williams.<br /><br />Seems the mythic artifact this time around is an alien skull, and the Russians want it. A kicking Cate Blanchett is Col Dr Irina Spalko, Soviet Psychic Baddie who has kidnapped Professor Oxley (John Hurt) and Marion (the welcome return of Karen Allen), and \\"Mutt\\" (the ubiquitous Shia LeBeouf) now enlists Dr Jones to help rescue them and save the world. Along the way, they must overcome a nuclear blast, carnivorous ants, waterfalls and the usual cavalcade of bad guys with guns in moving vehicles. Yes, the plot is obvious. But when you watch the older DVD's, I was a bit taken aback at just how obvious the old plots were. As Dean Stanforth says early in the film, \\"We seem to have reached the age where life stops giving us things and starts taking them away.\\"<br /><br />\\"Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull\\" is no-where near as bad as some of these aging fan-boys make it out to be. It's a darn sight better than 1984's [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]], and lacks only the magnetic presence of Sean Connery to equal [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]. The humor of the originals is intact, and Jones/Ford takes the wind out of the aging issue with some great lines and sight gags (fave line from Mutt - \\"for an old man you ain't bad in a fight. What are you, like 80?\\"). The usual wild white-knuckle chases through the jungle are terrific, even if you've seen it before.<br /><br />Ok, so the alien thing might be a bit harder to swallow than Holy Grails for the X-Files generation. And I did kind of miss the old fashioned non-CGI booby traps. But that doesn't detract from the basic fact that this is Steven Spielberg and George Lucas firing on all cylinders, and a welcome addition to the Indiana Jones Legacy.Ok, so the alien thing might be a bit harder to swallow than Holy Grails for the X-Files generation.

B0011ZNAIC|1.0|Please excuse me while I rant.    I was appalled by the complete lack of even the most elementary facts about the lives of honeybees. However, if you can give insects four legs instead of six, make them speak English, dress them up in sweaters, and make them fall in love with humans, I guess anything goes. *sigh*    First, honeybees have black bodies with yellow stripes, not the other way around. They do not pick a job and stick to it. Rather, as they age, they are genetically programmed to graduate to a vast variety of tasks in succession, spending the last halves of their lives as foragers. Male bees do NOT have stingers and they do ZERO work. In fact, they are barely tolerated by the workers and are kicked out of the colony at the end of the year. The hive, under normal conditions, is over 99% female. There are no hunky male \\"pollen jocks\\" sucking up pollen and spraying it everywhere because they somehow know it is good for flowers. In fact, the cartoon doesn't even portray the importance of pollen to the bees themselves. They somehow do it to be altruistic to the humans and flowers.    I am a beekeeper.  My main beef is that somewhere around the middle of the cartoon, the whole thing turns Marxist. Beekeepers are portrayed as evil exploiters of the apian working class, gassing them with smoke, laughing diabolically, generally behaving violently, and stealing their honey. Hmph. I love my bees and enjoy caring for them, as does every beekeeper. I treat them gently and they return the favor. In the movie, the bees end up suing the humans, and win, and all the honey is returned to the bees. Double Hmph. The bees get lazy and stop working. Nothing is pollinated, all plants die, and the world is on the verge of total collapse. (They got that part of the communist experiment right, at least.) Imminent doom is near. (Typical environmentalist hyperbole.)  The bees realize the consequences of their lawsuit and decide to start pollinating again to save the humans. (Typicalhappy ending that must be provided in every cartoon.)    OK. It's a cute movie with many witty moments but some parts are just cheesy and painful. I thought the portrayal of the defense lawyer as an out of control religious nut was particularly hilarious. In the end, the honeybees actually go back to work for the humans and both humans and bees have a renewed appreciation for each other, so the message in the end isn't entirely bad. Still, I don't like the idea that kids might leave the movie hating beekeepers and feeling guilty for eating honey \\"stolen\\" from the bees. Honeybees, by their nature, will usually produce up from one to four hundred pounds of honey per hive per year in excess of what they need for survival. It is their instinct to do this as long as they have the space and resources. We humans simply discovered how to manage the bees, give them plenty of good habitat, and harvest the excess crop. Good for us. Beekeepers have made plenty of mistakes along the way but that hasn't really included taking too much honey away from bees.  I challenge anyone to think of a tree that has a hollow big enough to produce such a vast storage space for honey as the modern Langstroth beehive.    I know, I know... it's only a cartoon, don't make such a big deal out of it. I do feel, though, that other cartoons have been much more true to the actual natural history and general biology of whatever species is being depicted and that this particular cartoon was both grossly scientifically inaccurate and overly political on various levels. In this movie, beekeepers were depicted as diabolically evil. There were also animal rights messages ... \\"Why is your life of any more value than mine?\\" is a particular quote by a bee that had me angry. One doesn't encounter that kind of unrealistic conflict between humans and animals in classics like Peter Rabbit.  Yucky.    A more accurate (and perhaps more interesting) cartoon would have explored the feminist world of the hive in whicha few males enjoy their brief lives as sex workers with the queen, after which their genitals snap off and they die. The 99% female population would then gang up on the rest of the small male minority that never got to mate, wrestling the lazy SOBs out one by one to starve and freeze in the cold so that they could achieve their efficient female, collectivist utopia at last.... Muahahahahaha!    Of course, such a cartoon could not be rated G. :)
B0012Q732O|4.0|Truthfully, the main complaint about this movie is the historical inaccuracy. While reviewers have valid points, I believe that this is more of a Fantasy film rather than a \\"based on facts\\" offering. (I would suggest people looking for accuracy check out Walking with Prehistoric Beasts\\"    What I liked about the film: There has been nothing like this in quite some time. Sure, we have had many Jurassic Park films with great looking dinosaurs, but I have always been interested in the mammals that came after. The creatures looked great! I loved the Saber-toothed Cat and the Mammoths running like buffalo was amazing. The Terror Birds were well done, also. I thought the acting was good and the line delivery was decent. Someone complained in another review about them talking in complete sentences, etc. I saw that as being immersed in the language of the day - in other words, this is what we understood. The story was fairly decent even though this was the least believable part. I think the writers were going for a pc theme, which was mostly okay.     What I didn't like (and this contains Spoilers) - Not enough creatures. I thought the Cat was going to be around more than 2 minutes to look after the hero, but no. I would have liked to have seen other mammals besides Cats and Mammoths (I'm not counting the horses). The thing that bothered me most was the evil Pharaoh/Leader with all of the slaves was just some old White guy. What is that about? Honestly. I expected an Alien or some type of creature or at least something a little more interesting. It made me wonder what they were trying to say. There were a few slow spots, but everything did seem to correlate to the story in the end.    Overall, it was a good movie. I would say it was a throwback to movies like Conan the Barbarian and Death stalker and even One Million BC. People that are looking for an educational aspect will be disappointed, although the creatures in the movie DID exist at the same time as humans (some reviewers are stating that they did not, this is not true. There were mammoths, terror birds, and saber-toothed cats up until around 10,000 years ago as well as other mammals such as Giant Ground Sloths, Dire Wolves, and Cave Bears). Again - Fantasy fare that is for the most part, well done, just don't expect a lot of creatures (which I was doing) as this is more of a Man vs. Man movie.
B000BBOUD6|4.0|If you understand what this movie was intended to be and surrender yourself to that intent, you will have an immensely enjoyable and emotionally satisfying movie-watching experience, with some of the most breathtaking  cinematography and scenery you will ever see, married to a beautiful musical score.  I fall in love with this movie anew each time I watch it, as has everyone to whom I've introduced it.    The movie and the Harrison novella (which I highly recommend reading) draw upon a long tradition of Biblical, mythological, and literary models for character and plot.  The personnae in LOTF are archetypes of characters from this tradition, and do not need subtlety of characterization, although each is a fully realized human being in the movie despite the minimalist dialogue.    LOTF echoes the stories of Cain and Abel (the Lord favoring the roaming shepherd over the settled farmer), Jacob and Essau, the Prodigal Son, the preference by Priam in the \\"Iliad\\" for his wild irresponsible son Paris over the responsible rule-abiding Hektor, the berserker warrior (Achilles) who lives beyond his society's norms, the medieval tradition of courtly unrequited love.  Susannah is Cathy from \\"Wuthering Heights\\", pining after the  brooding bipolar Heathcliffe rather than the nice English gentleman who loves her, or Scarlett pining for Ashley over Rhett.  What other posters have criticized as melodrama or plot predictability is not a fault for this type of storytelling (and I disagree about the melodrama), but very much an essential aspect of it.  The narration by One Stab and quotations from the letters capture very nicely the spare poetic prose of Harrison's novella.     There is a reason the movie is called \\"Legends\\" (myths) of the \\"Fall\\" (of humanity from a state of Edenic happiness and innocence).      This is a movie about the effects of mental illness and post traumatic stress disorder on family structure and personal happiness.  (Unfortunately, the  script did not make as clear as it should have the fact from the novella that Susannah suffered from manic-depression, which explains her paralysis and weepiness.)  LOTF is also a story of how the seeds of fraternal jealousy, sorrow, self-indulgence and irresponsibility are carelessly sown by parental favoritism.  It is a story of wanting to have what we think we love, instead of learning to love what we have.      Even without the literary echoes, LOTF tells a powerful story of family relationships in an emotionally true way.  The acting is mostly very good.  I would especially like to commend Aidan Quinn as the older, responsible, repressed brother Alfred, who represents encroaching civilization and governmental control.  What Quinn did with Alfred's inarticulate, fumbling, utterly vulnerable declaration of love for Susannah made that scene one of the most poignant in the movie.  Quinn can say more in a look than most actors can in several lines, and his portrayal of Alfred's stoic pain, goodness, and longing for family connection was so moving that his Alfred was able to be a memorable presence despite the flamboyant and charismatic Tristan of Brad Pitt.  I am not a big Pitt fan, but I thought he did a particularly good job here and showed real emotional depth.  Anthony Hopkins' commanding, domineering, libertarian Col. Ludlow was well done, although I wish he had played down the physical effects of the stroke in the second half.  I liked very much how Julia Ormond portrayed Susannah - which was how the part was written!  Gordon Tootoosis added gravitas.      If you are in the mood for a sad, sweeping, visually breathtaking (amazing scenery!), emotionally powerful movie, surrender yourself to this one, and you will not be disappointed.

There are plenty of great reviews out there regarding this series, but it's quick-wit writing and romantic character development made it a favorite of both sexes (not just another nerd sci-fi space trek adventure).   The packaging is simple and yet elegant enough to display with your video collection, and the four disks are individually housed in thin plastic jackets; actually rather nice for a set like this.  Amazon had it listed at $25, and with free shipping... it was a \\"no-brainer\\".  I'm a proud owner; you can be too.

0812974611|3.0|Mr Harris has clearly done his homework about aqueducts, city life, and life on the bay of Naples in the first century CE.  Had he made this a short history of Pompeii, description of life in the little city, and the eruption of Vesuvius in 79, it could have been a marvelously informative book.  Unfortunately, he decided to make it a novel, and failed utterly.  His research prepared him to write the \\"mechanics\\" of Roman city life, but not about Romans.  He lacks the depth of knowledge, not easily acquired, to be \\"fully aware of the strangeness and remoteness of a past age\\" and so is unable to \\"make it comprehensible to [his] own.\\"  (This latter is a comment on the task, and failure, of ancient historians from the biography of Julius Caesar by Christian Meier, professor of ancient history at the University of Munich.)  Because such awareness is beyond Harris' reach, his characters neither sound nor behave like 1st-century Romans but like 21st-century British or American sorts, viz., agnostics who nevertheless make judgments and conduct themselves according to an ethic derived from Judaism and Christianity.  Read the book for the information about the eruption; the characters are not Romans, and don't arouse much empathy.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Lin Bentolila, a dear friend, gave me the book for my birthday and after reading it, I decided to acquire the DVD movie version. Both gave me a rare view into a time in America that I knew little about. Published in 1939, the Grapes of Wrath is about the brutal and sad time people had to live... shall we say struggle through... and for the lucky some... survive during those days.     The DVD version starts with Tom Joad played by Henry Fonda returning home from a seven year prison sentence, reduced to four for good behavior. He is on parole but tries to get back to his family and the first scenes where he gets bothered by the questions of the truck driver that gives him a lift is simply an excellent way to set the stage for the hardship about to unfold.    When he gets home, he finds that no one is there, they have all abandoned the farm and he begins to understand what has happened because of a conversation with a man who refuses to leave his home.    I learned that back then people entered into agricultural agreements where they did not own the land but were allowed by the owners to use the land in return for a share of the crop produced, and as times got really bad because of the lack of water, the \\"dust\\" storms and the inability to produce, they could no longer afford to pay the agreed share and were therefore, run from their land... even though they had worked it for over 70 years seeing many family generations come and go on the land which they called home...     How incredibly sad... simply horrible... The story centers on a family with the last name of Joads and it is so hopeless at times that I felt the pain and sorrow of these characters daring to hope for a better life.    Desperate times, children left without food and without care because parents earned miserable wages and had to go to find whatever work was available. Labor contracts were not respected, conditions were oppressive, and the spark of an attempt to correct the situation was seen as a crimeand punished as such.    The emotions are deep and while the family undergoes many trials and desperate moments, they continue to have pride, human dignity, and the willingness to share whatever little they had. The road trip that takes them from their home in Oklahoma to California is at times exasperating because we suffer right along with these characters. The scenes at a road side diner where they buy bread... only able to pay for a 10 cent loaf is heart rendering and it is with a certain sense of trepidation that we realize that times in America today are again desperate for many. Never learning the great lessons from the past, we seem to repeat history over and over again, and between the housing market fiasco, the home foreclosures and the price of gas, let's hope we do not see Americans brought to another period of depression.    This is a must read and must see, while it is depressive, at times shocking, it poses fundamental questions of humanity. How can we live our lives in peace witnessing those who have so much and yet others not being able to eat? How do we ensure that our social systems protect our people from ever having to endure such harsh living conditions? At what point do we stop being human if we stand by and do nothing to change and bring opportunity and the right to work and earn a living to every person willing to work to make a living?

Never learning the great lessons from the past, we seem to repeat history over and over again, and between the housing market fiasco, the home foreclosures and the price of gas, let's hope we do not see Americans brought to another period of depression.<br /><br />This is a must read and must see, while it is depressive, at times shocking, it poses fundamental questions of humanity.

B000TEMS3O|5.0|Oblivion is seriously one of the best songs ever created (crank the volume to 50 and you'll know what I mean)! Except for Buddha For Mary, I love every song on this album (but only because I don't like that song's lyrics very much). Definitely a must buy!!
B000OV170W|4.0|This book is very good.  It was originally recommended for my daughter's summer reading with the caveat that it might not be appropriate.  Why the school would recommend something that they do not think is appropriate is another discussion.  Frankly, I don't see anything wrong with it although it may be over the head of some of the students required to read it.  They will read it as a good story.  I believe it was recommended more as life lessons, family values, morals, and ethics.  It does get a tad predictable but I have to admit that I never saw the end coming!

B000URDEB0|3.0|I've been a big fan of Nightwish for quite some time so I was a little worried when I heard they had gotten a new lead singer.  I decided to listen to the album on iTunes before buying it at a store here and I'm glad I did.  While the new lead singer has a good voice, she just doesn't match what they had before.  The style has changed enough that it doesn't feel as fantastical as Nightwish's music used to.  While I won't say this is a horrible album that isn't worth buying I WILL say that you should preview it before buying it, don't rely on your love of the old Nightwish, because you may be surprise...and not in the best way possible.

0385340567|1.0|I could hardly wait for Lee Child's newest book. Now I can't wait to finish it, if I finish it. I've never been one to skip words or pages, no matter how distressed I was at the writer, but this story pushed me to almost jump ship.    Where has Reacher gone? Does his life without connections have him out of touch with life? I am disappoint but hopeful that the next Jack Reacher story will tell us \\"Nothing to Lose\\" was a hoax, the real Jack Reacher had been captured and held for a year and will escaped to tell his tale. Oh, one can only hope.
B000002H33|5.0|I received this album as a christmas present from my sister back in '86 and ever since I was hooked. This is the best trash album by far.

Dont miss this one. A must buy !!!
0345420128|4.0|I've only had one lucid dream so far and it was before reading this book, so I can't speak to the effectiveness of the techniques presented.  But I can say two things.  One, the authors seem to know what they are talking about and have plenty of experience with the subject matter both from personal lucid dreams and scientific research and the book brings that across loud and clear.  Two, this one is written from a scientific and not a metaphysical perspective.  The authors believe all altered consciousness is a lucid dream and there is no such thing as out of body experiences.  I'm fine with that and will be making my own decision, but there are others who believe we are out of our body every night and that all lucid dreams are actually OBE's to some extent...or at least that true OBE's and dreams overlap.  I think both views are important for making your own decision.  There is no doubt true OBE's happen at least to those who have been Near Death.  Whether they can be induced apart from lucid dreams is another question which I haven't answered.  Good luck.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|I was 11 years old when I first saw this movie with my father. I remember it like it was yesterday. This is one of Steven Spielbergs absolute best films . Its warm, fun, sad and it has really cool special effects. The music by John Williams on this film is amazing. I highly recommed this film for all families and sci-fi fans out there. E.T. phone home !!!
0061191981|4.0|This is a very quick read from Gordon Ramsey.  I think the media exaggerates and feeds preconceived ideas into people's minds about what this man is about.  The book really hits some high notes about where Gordon Ramsey is coming from.  When he appears on tv yelling and pissed off at someone, it is usually because he sees their potential and that is his way of bringing it out of the person.  Surprisingly easy to read, the book gives insight on his past and just what makes him the man he is today.  Definitely worth a read.  I read through it pretty much through 2 sittings and found new respect for this man.
0345501292|5.0|This is a great read and I recommend it to any Indy fan or reader that enjoys a good \\"making of movie\\" book.   From the same writer and style written as The making of Star Wars, this book has it all from the 4 movies. The introduction on how George Lucas and Steven Spielberg got the whole thing going was interesting. Learning all the funny little things that happened on set were amusing as well. Amazing pictures, I thought I'd seen all Indy pictures until I saw this book.  Definitely a good read and well, well worth the money.
0553213105|5.0|I've read this book twelve times, and I will never get bored with it. I'm hoplessly romantic, and I love the different conflicts, the interesting and independent characters, the plot twists, and the happily ever after at the end. Elizabeth Bennet is an independent, youthful, clever, and witty young woman in the eighteen hundreds. She is my favorite character in the novel, and has a wonderful spunky nature that keeps the book alive. The characters are fully formed and realistic, from beautiful Jane to the hilarious Mrs. Bennet. This is, by far, the best Jane Austen book ever published, and recommend it very strongly for anyone starting to read eighteenth and nineteenth century literature.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I bought this dvd after watching the movie on Masterpiece Theater's Jane Austen series.  After watching [[ASIN:0800141660 Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)]] & [[ASIN:B000E1ZBGS Pride & Prejudice]], I was interested in any movies based on Jane Austen's novels. Persuasion was the first in the series they showed.  Even though it was a made for tv movie, I enjoyed it very much.  I thought Rupert Penry Jones was very handsome, & Sally Hawkins was a pretty good actress as well.  I liked that even after 8 years had passed since Anne Elliott was \\"persuaded\\" to turn down her beau Cpt Wentworth's proposal, when they met again, they still harbored feelings for each other, even if Wentworth still felt bitter after her rejection.  I'm a real sucker for romantic movies.  This was my second favorite Jane Austen movie, my first was Pride & Prejudice, the version with Kiera Knightley & Matthew MacFadyen.  The only part of the movie I would've liked different was towards the end, when Anne was running all over town searching for Wentworth, after she had read his note telling her he still loved her.  That seems kind of unladylike behavior, but in the end everything worked out.  I especially loved the ending when they married & Wentworth brought her back to her family's old home, after she had to sell it in the beginning for financial reasons.  That was very sweet!  I would definitely recommend this movie for all romantics out there.  After buying this movie from Amazon.com, I've viewed it 3 times already.
1594481717|4.0|I lived to see the coming of the space age and the flight to the moon.  Because we found ourselves behind the Russians and sorely lacking in trained engineers we began to push college education and the \\"knowledge trades.\\"      We have flourished technically as a result.  Computers and the internet magnified that and many of us scrambled to get into those leading edge industries because that's where the future lay!    That time is all but past and a new age is ushering in.  By that I certainly don't mean that the computer age is over - far from it.  But we pay engineers from India and other Asian places, fifteen thousand dollars a year to do what Americans want many tens of thousands of dollars to do.  The last time you called for computer tech support - did you talk to an American or to someone in Bombay, Inida?    This is not a book about New Age philosophy or any of that sort of thing.  The author will make three fantasic points and arguments (which I don't want to give away here), which show that we have reached the peak of that era, and he shows that these trades WILL NOT be the hot trades of the future.      So if you're thinking about making sure that little Mary or Johnny has a career in the knowledge industries in their future, think again!    The book will show you that being a lawyer, accountant, or software engineer are NOT the best trades for the future.      There are not too many books that can actually change the outlook of your mind, but this is certainly one of them.  It is very convincingly argued.    The first part of the book tells you why the old paradigm will not serve us well for the future.    The second part of the book tells you what skills you will need to develop and gives some ideas and exercise to facilitate their development.    I heartily recommend this book.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a wonderful piece that brings the period -and the man- vividly to life. My 17-year-old daughter joined me in anxiously awaiting each installment, for which I expressly ordered HBO. I have only two minor complaints, which I will address further below.  The portrayals were superbly acted, and the entire piece contained subtlety & restraint while giving the viewer plenty to \\"chew on\\". Each evocative scene unfolded with nuance & earthy context, formed by realistic dialogue. There was some use of edgy cinematography, with unexpected angles and tight -often off-center- closeups, but the effect usually works well. It forces the eye onto a new detail.<br /><br />The conflicting emotions of this very real man can actually be supposed through these reenactments. I love that Mr McCullough's book was the basis for this adaption. His finely wrought depiction of a world turned upside down for Adams and the surrounding subjects is so realistic as to be stepped into, and this beautifully-made film does it justice. The locations and realism in living conditions are not to be missed.<br /><br />The two overlooked areas of this project that were somewhat distracting:<br />It was sometimes difficult to know how much time had passed or where a scene was taking place. The aging of characters occasionally seemed inconsistent -most noticeably with the children. A simple caption introducing a location or year would have been appreciated. Still, these flaws do not prevent my rating this with 5 stars. We need more like this.<br /><br />While not a blockbuster-mentality offering, I do feel that a viewer who has some interest in history, visually stunning scenery, and a decent vocabulary will find this biopic riveting. The tension and plot of human condition is palpable throughout. No car(riage) chase scenes necessary.
B0016A2FFG|4.0|I think this a STRONG release from The Good Rev..<br /><br />The music is totally scrumptous and Al's singing is beyond great.<br />There are some real gems here -\\"Lay It Down\\" and \\"Take Your Time\\" stand out.<br /><br />On the video promo prerelease of cd they claimed that much of the album was created/written right there in the studio. And judging by the lyrics -I believe them... Not that they are bad, but not Real Strong. As, you may know \\"Let's Stay Together\\" was written in this manner (on the spot).<br /><br />Question - WHERE is is my Terrific Al Green Cover (I'd love to hear him do Prince song)?<br /><br />Again, if you are a Al Green Fan you WILL Love this wonderful cd.

1401300529|4.0|This book is David Halberstam doing what he did best which is reviewing the war as a political-military history, providing insights into the personalities of the leading characters and standing up for the guys who fought the war at the sharp end.<br /><br />This is not a detailed campaign history of the Korean War, if that is what you are looking for then look to other works. Halberstam takes a few key battles to elucidate the main phases of the war: the North Korean attack and subsequent rout of the South Korean and U.S. forces back to Pusan; the stand of the U.N. forces in the Pusan perimeter; Inchon and the breakout and pursuit of the North Koreans to the Yalu river; and the entry of the Chinese and the subsequent stalemate.<br /><br />His portraits of the leading players are colorful and he is not afraid to take a strong position on the various merits and flaws of each of these.  As others of pointed out a great deal of the book concerns MacArthur, MacArthur's feud with Truman and MacArthur's key role in the disaster that befell the U.N. force after the Chinese intervention. Halberstam is not a fan of Douglas MacArthur, essentially portraying him as a deeply flawed individual.<br /><br />The military history of the book is shown primarily through the recollections of the men who found in some of the nastiest battles of the \\"police action\\" including the Naktong river, Chosin, the Twin Tunnels, Chipyongni and Unsan. Halberstam clearly brings home the desperation of the fighting and the cynicism of the men, who often felt betrayed by the incompetence of their military leadership and forgotten by the American people.  Sadly the average fighting man in Korea was, particularly in the early stages of the war prior to Ridgeway's arrival, poorly served by the senior officers and Halberstam is unflinching in his portrayal of their incompetance.<br /><br />Overall an excellent review of the \\"forgotten war\\".  Those who fought there deserve to be remembered for what they did and this book certainly reminds us of what the ordinary soldier went through in Korea. The book is easy to read and is accessible to anyone with an interest in 20th century history, not just the hard core miltary history enthusiasts. There are one or two minor flaws mainly around the maps which are sometimes in conflict with the text, but these are minor issues.

0375842209|5.0|I heard this book was for young adults, but decided to give it a try after seeing an ad in the NYT's that highlighted some glowing reviews.  While the reviews got me excited to read this book, they didn't even come close to capturing how extraordinary this book is.  I'd have to say \\"The Book Thief\\" is one of the most wonderful books that I've read in recent memory.  Also, don't let the fact that the book is labeled as young adult stop you from reading it - this is better than most \\"adult\\" fiction books you can pick up.<br /><br />The story takes place in a small town outside of Munich, during WWII.  The narrator of the story is death, first introduced to us as nine year old Liesel Meminger witnesses the death of her younger brother, as they are sent to live with foster parents.  Liesel is illiterate, but after she witnesses the death of her brother she picks up a book, \\"The Gravedigger's Handbook\\", and winds up hiding under her mattress at her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa.  Ultimately, we see the relationship of Hans and Liesel  develop as he spends nights reading to her and teaching her to read.  Liesel's love of books is kindled and shortly later, she begins her book \\"thievery\\" starting at a Nazi book burning and continuing with a relationship she develops with the mayor's wife.<br /><br />While I won't go into much more detail about the plot, there are several things that endeared this book to me.  The first is the well-rounded and developed characters that Zusak creates - from Liesel, to her best friend Rudy and the young Jewish boy Max that Rosa and Hans hide in their basement.  Second, Zusak re-creates wartime Munich and the surrounding area with such detail that I'd find myself closing my eyes after reading the chapters and transporting myself to this horrible time and place.  Finally, Zusak's use of death as the narrator was a master stroke for this book.  However, it is not just his use of death as the narrator, but attributes of death.  Death is not a vengeful, mean, evil force in \\"The Book Thief\\", but a removed, dispassionate observer - even aghast at what is happening in this terrible time and place.<br /><br />My words certainly do this book justice.  From the hilarious irony of Rudy smearing himself in charcoal and emulating Jesse Owens to the cruelty of Liesel and Rudy hiding in a parade of Jews through Munich to feed them stale bread, this is one remarkable novel.  Make time for this book - it will leave an indelible mark with you.evil force in \\"The Book Thief\\", but a removed, dispassionate observer - even aghast at what is happening in this terrible time and place.

CCR has many good songs, all of their popular ones are very good, but there are lots of other good ones that are not so popular.  It comes with 6 discs.  One disc is pre-creedence material that is actually very worthwhile.  Two of the discs are kind of a live version of songs.  The set also comes with a 20-30 page booklet with all kinds of commentary on what CCR was and how they came to be.<br />To me, discovering CCR was like finding something new and fresh when looking back in time.

Trying to live a quiet life in Brazil, Bruce is trying to find a cure for his gamma-radiated alter ego, while keeping his heart rate and anger under control.  When an accident at work, allows the government to trace his location, Bruce must once again flee and seek help where he can find it.<br /><br />After Ang Lee's craptastic Hulk five years ago, I had little hope for the Hulk movie franchise. From a ridiculous-looking Stay-Puff-Marshmallow-Man-Hulk to even more ridiculously silly radioactive killer dogs, I was glad to hear that this new movie was going to completely ignore the Ang Lee version.<br /><br />It wasn't so surprising that Ed Norton did an amazing job as Bruce Banner. He was the sole reason that I had a glimmer of hope for the movie. Getting back to the more dramatic feel of the Hulk tv show, Norton and company was finally able to do the franchise justice. Norton delivered the depth and complexity to the Bruce Banner/Hulk persona that not many could do successfully.  Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson, and the rest of the supporting cast were exceptional as well. Liv Tyler, as Betty Ross, had great chemistry with Norton. Tim Roth played Blonsky/Abomination and was an intense power-hungry villain. William Hurt played the role of General Ross, Betty's father and the person in charge of hunting down The Hulk in order to exploit his abilities. Tim Blake Nelson, as Samuel Sterns, played a great \\"mad scientist\\" role. And there were some fun cameos by Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee, and Mr. Iron Man himself: Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />The special effects and action scenes were much better in this film as well. The Hulk finally gets to battle a worthy adversary. And in ignoring the first Hulk movie, they were able to re-tell the origin story in just the beginning credits in the classic style of the tv show. There is even a point in the movie where we get to hear the classic theme song. Not corny, but dramatically fitting.<br /><br />With having the origin story out of the way, we are able to jump into the story and concentrate on the depth of the Bruce Banner character and his search for a cure. With a great story, complex characters, and quality special effects, please try to forget if you saw the first Hulk, and watch this one with no preconceptions.

0385339682|4.0|The title may suggest a legal thriller but The Last Juror ,while it does revolve around a murder-rape trial and its aftermath is not a bbok that fits snugly into this category.The trial is that of Danny Padgett,a member of a notorious criminal family in Ford County ,Mississipi who kills a young mother while here two young children watch .The case is pretty cut and dried but the family is not above witness intimidation and bribery .Padgett is convicted however but escapes the death penalty ,vowing that if released he will exact revenge on the jury.Nine years later he is free and jury members begin to die .    The tale is narrated by the local newspaper owner ,a callow young northener named Willie Traynor who grows to love the community and to observe how it changes over the years -the book opening in the 1970's .The special focus is on his friendshsip with the remarkable black woman ,Callie Ruffin all of whose sons are PHD's and who becomes a surrogate mother to Willie ,sharing insights and philosophies over gargantuan home cooked  meals at her home .  We trace the evolution of the community through changes both national and local -the integration of the school system and jury system (Callie is a juror at the trial),Vietnam and its impact locally ,the growth of corporate strip mall America and the demise of local ,family owned businessses.It is a warm but not sentimental book and while the court room scenes are handled with genuine drama and insight it is in the picture of a changing ,conservative rural community that the book has its greatest interest   It may not appeal to those who like the legal thriller side of Grisham but it is a compelling rural odyssey that manages to be warm ,nostalgic and curiously tough minded all at the same time     A slice of Americana that Garrison Keiller fans should like too

0307387178|2.0|Into the Wild begins with the ending - the body of a starved young man is found in a sleeping bag in Alaska.  So there's no suspense as to where Alex Supertramp (born Christopher McCandless) is going to wind up.  Reading his story, I found myself too much of an old fart to appreciate it.  McCandless hits the road in rebellion against his suburban middle class parents.  Author Jon Krakauer explores the culture and tradition of extreme minimalist travel, from Henry David Thoreau and John Muir to lesser-known figures like Everett Ruess, who was lost in the California desert in 1934.  When I read about some nineteen year old young man setting off alone with no map and no money, all I think is, \\"What a dumb kid\\".  I never succumbed to the romance of Kerouac's [[ASIN:0142437255 On the Road (Penguin Classics)]] back in the day either.  I read Into the Wild on the recommendation of a younger coworker who found it a romantic and tragic tale.  I can see how it could strike people that way, but not me.  I acknowledge that adventurers' lives are theirs to risk, but I don't find McCandless's story romantic, but more like a submission for the Darwin Award.
B001608QVS|3.0|I have very mixed feelings about this set. I love the Dirty Harry movies, but if you already own them, there is very little reason to upgrade to Blu-ray. The first two movies have almost no improvement over an upconverted DVD. They are very grainy and dark and even though these are 1970's movies they could have done a much better job restoring them. There is even dirt on many of the frames - NOTICEABLE dirt. It almost felt like watching it in a movie theater after the print had been used a few hundred times. The rest of the movies are better, but the PQ is still maybe a 3.5 out of 5.0. The extras that are included are \\"okay\\" but I wish they would have just left them out, given us traditional blu-ray boxes in a slipcase and dropped the price about $30 to $49.99. Even better would be to throw all 5 movies into a case like the Die Hard movies.<br />5.0 for the movies<br />1.5 for the PQ on the first two movies<br />2.5 for the last 3<br />3-4.0 for the sound quality.

I must admit though all of the acting was superb except Robin Williams. Once again he disappoints in this movie. Every time I see his name I think of older movies like Patch Adams where he does an excellent job. None the less, this movie is at least worth a rent.

1400032717|4.0|Told through the eyes of an autistic boy named Christopher, \\"The Curious Incident...\\" feels different than other fiction because of the fresh perspective.  The events are mundane, but the narrator's interactions with others make for laugh-out-loud situations.    Christopher can often be maddening, and you empathize for the frustration in those around him.  He is totally devoid of emotion or imagination.  He's coldly logical and methodical, and has a tendency to sit for hours thinking through math problems.  And he's focused like a laser-beam, to the point of being obsessive.  He remembers anything.  So, Christopher is basically a robot.    None of the characters are flat.  His sweet father... with a violent-side.  His loving mother, with her lack of morals and inability to deal with conflict.    The portrayal is blunt and doesn't pull punches.  This book could have easily had a preachy theme about \\"autistics are great people once you get to know them...\\" but luckily it never devolves into that - Christopher's behavior is shown in all it's unpleasant glory.  I liked it and would definitely recommend it.  3.5 stars
B0002W4SWC|5.0|Much had been made back when Ren&eacute;e Zellweger landed the role of one of England's most recent iconic characters, Bridget Jones, a thirtysomething woman looking for love while dealing with her job, wacky parents, well-meaning yet misguided friends, and of course, the perils of her love life. Yet Ms. Zellweger pulled off Bridget flawlessly.<br /><br />Yes, Bridget is not the prototype of the Independent Woman. And I think it is on purpose. The movie, in my opinion, is about not being perfect but struggling to accept the flaws all women have, so exaggeration can be handy in that regard. And poor Bridget does have her moments, from dinner parties with Smug Marrieds to bunny suits to caddish but handsome bosses that she knows she should avoid, yet cannot stay away from. What woman has not been attracted to the \\"wrong\\" man despite their better judgment?<br /><br />Speaking of the caddish boss, Hugh Grant seemed to have loads of fun once he got to shed the stumbling, bumbling persona he is usually known for in his other roles. Daniel Cleaver is slick, smooth, and uses his good looks to entice Bridget - and a lot of other women. And he loves the thrill of the chase. He is not, however, honest and faithful, something that Bridget finds out in a most humiliating way, which leads to...<br /><br />Colin Firth's Mark Darcy. As many likely know, Mark and Bridget's first meeting and subsequent relationship is based on Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Both Mark and Bridget are pressured by their respective parents to meet at the annual New Year's shindig, the turkey curry buffet, where Mark is rude to Bridget and insults her. From that point on, Bridget dislikes Mark, as well. Yet wherever Bridget is - be it a disastrous book launch party, staying at the same getaway spot as her and Daniel, or at that same Smug Marrieds dinner party - he is there, and always seems to catch Bridget at her most humiliating. (Perhaps this is what makes his declaration after said dinner partyall the more endearing.) Colin Firth, on the surface, has the most thankless role as Mark Darcy, who is more severe and staid. But, like with the original story of P&P - a production he starred in and, of course - inspired Ms. Fielding to model Mark after - the metamorphosis is great. Colin Firth can say more with a small smile or with his eyes. But between Mark's aforementioned declaration, his helping Bridget out professionally [check out their faces during the courtroom interview scene], and being Bridget's white knight again at Bridget's own birthday dinner, it becomes apparent there is more to Mark beneath the surface, as Bridget comes to realize - almost too late. But, as it is a movie, she does - and the final scenes, to me, put the \\"romantic\\" in romantic comedy. And Zellweger and Firth had fabulous chemistry. As did Grant/Zellweger. So there are no complaints in the romance area to be had. (Firth/Grant were also hilarious and had great antagonistic chemistry as rivals.)<br /><br />As for the comedy part? Check out the much-discussed Daniel/Mark fight scene! Hilarious. Only they can halt the almost girl-like fighting to sing happy birthday. (And there is a similar fight in the sequel involving a fountain. Thus showing TPTB knew the first fight was classic enough to do a retread!) Add in Bridget's flighty mother and chronically bemused/depressed father, and the laughs keep coming.<br /><br />Bridget's friends offer a nice framework for the laughs as well as heart - even if they are sadly underused here versus the book, but at ninety minutes, it is inevitable that some things from the book get short shrift in the movie. That said, Sally Phillips as Sharon/\\"Shazza\\" was a riot.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie where the heroine is self assured and is confident in herself without needing anyone else? This is NOT the movie for you. Ms. Fielding and those who wrote the movie seemed to like to mock all of the insecurities with weight, sex, and families thatwomen moan about (thus making Bridget sort of an \\"Every Woman\\") and, for comedy's sake, it is much more exaggerated in the film than in the book. Bridget does get herself in some uncomfortable spots. But, despite her pratfalls, she does pick herself up - after moping, as some do - and carries on. But since the movie deals largely with her torn between two men, she is not the role model for the modern woman, although it is what Bridget WISHES she was, hence the smart irony of it all.<br /><br />That said, if you are NOT looking for some deep meaning and just want some romance with a dose of comedy to chase the blues away? Sit back, grab the ice cream and/or a glass of wine, and enjoy!

B000FGGERM|5.0|For most, \\"Blackwater Park\\" is considered Opeth's best release though it's probably the one that got them the biggest attention. Like most of their albums or \\"observations\\" as they call them, you're going to get tons of changes in riffs, tempos, vocal styles and varying degrees of length. Though there's nothing inherently new about each record, its the refinement and better songwriting that's more noteworthy and with this record, the band still likes to have lots of sections and long songs but they're done with more care that you don't even notice that it's taking so long for the song to end and it's a good thing.    The Leper Affinity: Naturally the track has a quiet fade-in before blasting out of the speakers with a massive riff and goes through a number of riffs from syncopated breakdowns to Mikael Akerfeldt's underrated vocals to a gorgeous piano outro. 8/10    Bleak: A lot of people said this was their favorite off the record and have to admit it took awhile before it caught me. Beginning with a big sense of dissonance, then comes in a great catchy riff before its off-kilter verses. Not only is it well executed but it's even structured accessibility with its own \\"chorus\\". 9/10    Harvest: If you were a fan of \\"Benighted\\" from the last album or the entire Damnation cd, this'll be up your alley. Tons of acoustic chording all over the place and it's catchy to a certain degree though strangely I kind of find it...boring. Blasphemous I know but aside from the vocals, the track never really pulled me in though I'm sure lot of people will love it. 8/10    The Drapery Falls: Depressing chording and E-bow riff (the heavy part goes on a bit too long for me) but Mikael uses his vocals to great effect in the clean parts and its \\"chorus\\" but the heavy sections didn't really interest me and there was only a couple riffs that I loved and the outro is basically another intro taking up 2 whole minutes of one section. Poo. 7.5/10    Dirge for November: I don't really care for this one but the intro with its acoustic guitar and blues-y solo is gorgeous only that goes away and the heavyness kicks in again with more E-bow (they loved that thing on this record). It's simple enough and not really long but it's just not that interesting 6/10    The Funeral Portrait: Awesome groove the main riff creates during the intro and the song is practically chockful of awesome riffs and solos that it's easily a highlight on the album. I'd very much recommend listening to this one. 9/10    Patterns in the Ivy: More of a prelude to the closer with just an acoustic guitar doing folkish arpeggios before a piano comes in and offers chord accompaniment and then some more higher key melodies. It's lovely and fun to play though probably not iPod worthy. 8.5/10    Blackwater Park: Probably one of the coolest chord progression the band has with our trusty E-bow again before going into more heavier riffs with one having a great groove to it before going into a long clean part that's nice to hear in its strange lovelyness (even if it's slightly too long for me) and the ending riffs are awesome but strangely it's that middle section I'm not a big fan of. Odd I know. 8.5/10    Blackwater Park could be considered a great starting record if you want to get into the band. All the songs are not over 10 minutes like Morningrise, complex like Still Life or slightly meandering like Ghost Reveries. It's a solid release from a band that knows how to balance the quiet with the supremely loud.
B0015I2P0Y|4.0|The first time I listened to this CD, it didn't do much for me.  The first few tracks aren't necessarily the ones that are most memorable and that was part of the reason I didn't like it that much at first.  However,  after a couple more listens, the music really started to hook me.  There have been comparisons between Elbow and Coldplay, and there are similarities (intelligent lyrics, slightly downbeat, reflective musical style), Overall, I think that there's more variety in Elbow's music and the vocal range of the lead singer seems greater than Coldplay.  Several of the tracks have a Latin beat underlying the music and it's an engaging counterpoint to the otherwise very British sound.  Standout tracks are \\"Grounds for Divorce\\", \\"Audience with the Pope\\", \\"The Fix\\", and \\"One Day Like This\\".  I've already added these tracks to the playlist that I listen to most of the time.  Give it a listen....well, maybe several listens before you make up your mind.  It's worth it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I ordered season 1 of \\"Supernatural\\" after seeing a couple of episodes on the CW station.  It was a great purchase...each episode is like a mini scary movie and it's so addicting that I found myself watching 3-4 episodes a night!  The show does a great job of mixing serious issues with humor between the two brothers.  I had my fiance and his daughter watch the show and now they are both addicted as well.  I would highly recommend this product!
B000ZN802W|1.0|10 years ago, I read Into the Wild, and became so bored with it that I didn't finish it.  10 years later, I watched Into the Wild and became so bored with it that I stopped watching it (I did finish it the next day).  The biggest thing wrong with this movie is the story it tells.  A 23 year old college graduate wanders off and travels across country with the ultimate goal of going to Alaska.  Meanwhile, his family thinks he's probably dead.  The movie tries to explain his actions are because his parents fought a lot and were really wealthy and materialistic.  The disturbing thing about this movie is that he is portrayed as some kind of hero that escapes our horrible \\"society\\".  Please.  The guy was obviously mentally ill, but the movie conveniently leaves this out.  I feel bad for the guy's family after watching this.  Into the Wild is a long, bad, bloated, and ultimately disappointing movie.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I ordered the second season of \\"Supernatural\\" at the same time I ordered the first season and I'm so glad I did! Once again I find myself watching 3 to 4 episodes a night.  The show is cleverly written and the actors do a great job of keeping viewers entertained.  I can't wait for the third season to come out on dvd....I'm hoping a fourth season is being written and that the show continues to have great success.  I highly recommend this product.
B0017R5UAA|3.0|So I was passing through one day and noticed the Sun Giant cover art by Fleet Foxes on Amazon. I was fixated by it. Yeh sure, dont judge an album by its cover art, but I looked at that spectacular view with the colossal architecture in the background and thought, I want to be there... If they can put me in that picture for just one track... Im bought. The opener does just that... and the single 'Mykonos' is a breathtaking dreamscape of accessible melody.     So, yeh Pitchfork and all the other high brow publications can give a handful of important reasons why this album is worth its weight in gold... but I was more interested in the melodies. For me, Fleet Foxes is most glorious when it strikes that harmonious chord. When all those exotic instruments materialize a blissful tune. Tracks like 'Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\\", \\"He doesnt Know Why\\", \\"Your Protector\\" \\"Oliver JAmes\\".     And maybe thats inferior of me to look at it this way. But maybe thats why 'Tv on the Radio's' so called most important album of the year - (Cookie Mountain), wasn't collectively anyones' favorite album of the year (bar a few gorgeous tracks). Melody is underrated. And in my opinion Fleet Foxes' debut album lacks that melodic cohesion. It has the resources, the spirit and the know how, but it lacks that innate musical melody to make it a 5 star album.     Even the tracks I mention suffer from awkward moments of cheap thrills. For example, the latter half of \\"He doesn't know why\\" just ends up going through the motions, for the sake of completion.     A brilliant first half of whimsical phrasing is finished off with a generic and passive ....\\"There's nothing .. I can ... doo\\" which just deflates a very beautiful and engaging piece of music.    How does that go unnoticed. I dont know... but the song deserves a better chorus line. It deserved more attention.    Of course I expect to get slammed for this.

0938045695|4.0|Enter the Kettlebell is one of Pavel's better books.  Very good review on the basic lifts with lots of details.  However, this book still disappoints me as all of Pavel's books do.  It still has way too many advertisements for his other products.  Pavel, can't you please just put that at the end of the book?
B000002KHH|5.0|This review may not be very helpful. Because I ordered this item (and some other previous Amazon.com music), for a friend who hasn't any access to the Internet and limited transportation. And I know my friend likes this album/CD, I personally do not care for Black Sabbath.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This is an exceptional film that explores America's unique obsessions with driving ambitious industry and evangelical religion. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, Oil, the film is a stand alone excellent product that is independent of the novel. The complex subject matter can be explored because of the film's narrative structure that is chronological and straight forward story telling as well as the exceptional acting demonstrated by all the main characters. The film may be interpreted as fascinating character study and it may also be interpreted as an exploration of the darker side of capitalism encountering the darker side of evangelism.     The film begins in 1898 with scenes of Daniel Plainview, a silver miner, discovering silver and simultaneously breaking his leg through a nasty fall down a mine shaft. We see this man literally crawl to stake his claim before he discovers oil in his second attempt at exploration. Gradually this man hires a crew and begins a series of discoveries of oil until in 1902 an accident kills a driller and Daniel informally adopts the orphaned child HW as his son. In 1911 Plainview and his business associate are approached by a California sheep herder, Paul Sunday, who reveals for a small payment where oil can be found on his family farm. Daniel and his adopted son act like hunters and visit the Sunday farm and find the claims are true. From this point a struggle begins between Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, the charismatic evangelical preaching son in the Sunday family. This tension builds as the Sunday family is pushed into the sidelines as Plainview's wealth and dominance builds. Multiple dramatic episodes unfold as a derrick explosion and fire leave young HW deaf. A long lost younger brother of Daniel appears only to eventually be revealed to be less than he promises. Eli Sunday establishes the Church of the Third Revelation and becomes a force that Daniel must compromise with to maintain control of property rights andworkers.     As character study, the film is exceptional. We see Daniel as a man of amazing drive and determination. He is ambitious and crafty. These characteristics lead to outstanding industry and internal corruption. He moves from a speculator who strategizes to get oil out of the ground to a man obsessed with control of the land rights of the oil fields and the maneuvers needed to outwit his competition and maintain power.  He cares for the orphan HW but his parenting skills and priorities are out of order. HW is rendered deaf in a derrick explosion and eventually Daniel is able to get him into a school for the deaf where he learns sign language allowing him to communicate. Daniel also opens up when he thinks his long lost younger brother, Henry, joins him and wishes to work in the oil field. In conversation with Henry we hear Daniel's philosophy with such comments as: \\"I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed.\\"  He also states: \\"I hate most people.\\" Later he says: \\"I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.\\"  Prophetically he says:\\"I want to make enough money to get away from everyone.\\"  It is with Eli Sunday that we see revealed the most amazing sides of Daniel's personality. Daniel relishes in humiliating the evangelist and his family until through the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli gains power over the local landowners and Daniel must become `saved' and part of the congregation to gain access to their land-rights. Daniel must undergo the trial of acting like his soul has been saved by Jesus so as to gain financial advantage. This humiliation further buries his soul under his unresolved inner demons and pain, twisting him further from human experience and compassion. Daniel Day-Lewis plays this role with attention to every small detail of expression which paints a frightening portrait of fierce heartless greed and lust for power driven by some inner absence of recognition of his fellowman's dignity.    The character of Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano, is only a bit less complex.  This young man gains power through evangelical fundamentalism and after several years of humiliation and beating from Daniel, seeks his revenge is forcing Daniel to become saved by Jesus to gain property rights. But Eli knows that Daniel is not really saved, for Eli also is prideful and uses his church as a theater to degrade and belittle Daniel when he knows Daniel is desperate for the land rights to take his oil to the Pacific Ocean.    In addition to an astute character study, the film is also a study in American capitalism and American evangelism. We see the dark under belly of both and we see the results when the two forces clash. This is a thoughtful and exceptional film.
B000FC1AOI|2.0|I read this book after hearing about the movie, and I was disappointed.  Not bad for a first effort, but all in all, this book was lacking depth.  There is so much more the author could have done to develop the chain of events that occurred as the result of the notes.  The idea that the book is based on is a good one, but the development of the idea comes up short.
B0000VD04M|4.0|Interestingly, I've read a lot of message boards and opinions that agree this is one of Tim Burton's worst movies.  Yet it is getting an 8.1 rating on IMDb and is currently ranked #193 on their Top 250 (his highest ranked movie as far as I can tell; higher than Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, and Big Fish).     I tend to agree with the IMDb contingent.  Martin Landau's performance (as Bela Lugosi) alone makes this movie great and worth repeat viewings.  If any Oscar was more deserved than his performance (in a supporting role), I can't think of it.  Add to this Johnny Depp, who is always fantastic, and tons of minor characters played by a collection of colorful actors and actresses, and you get an entertaining, never dull film.  The movie is in black and white which turned out to be a perfect choice.  The monochrome gives it the atmosphere and feel necessary for the engaging story of the oft-called worst director of all time: Ed Wood Jr.  Tim Burton's love for Ed Wood is evident and Johnny Depp's performance makes the viewer love him as well.  This movie may not be for everyone, but I recommend that you at least rent it (everyone should see Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi).  If you are a huge Tim Burton or Johnny Depp fan just buy it now.
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|This was a great book when I first read it; but the transition to a screen play took the creative elements which were good and over simplified the battle between good and evil.  The book showed many elements and much deeper character development, you felt sorry for the hero who had an understandable morality system.  The movie hero seemed to present might makes right with no redeeming characteristics.  Definitely a rental!
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|This is, by far, one of the most valued treasures of my CD and DVD library. If I were stranded on the cliche deserted island and left with my choice of DVD to possess, this would be it hands down. I would also try to cheat my way into bringing the equally exceptional performances of the piano concerti on DVD.    Not only are these performances extraordinarly brilliant, but are accompanied by six masterclasses given by Barenboim in Chicago. These masterclasses are more than beneficial to watch. Even if one is playing one of the other 26 opused sonatas (or something entirely different), these in-depth classes are indispensable.    At the time I'm writing this review, this set is currently 30% off. Do yourself a favor and take advantage of this steal!
1400082773|5.0|This is a wonderful, detailed, and heartfelt trek through the life of Barack, including memories of his grandparents, his step-father, and mostly his beloved mom. He also explores repeatedly the impact of an absent father - something I have experienced first-hand and with startling intensity in my own daughter and my step children.  He is a gifted writer, and listening to the audio edition (read by Barack himself) adds a stunningly personal dimension to the book.  I read \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" first, and I wish I had read it second. This is a man with true depth of character.  I love it! I love him!  BARACK FOR PRESIDENT!
0307265730|3.0|I am an avid reader of Lahiri.  She is inarguably one of my favorite writers.  I have read the two previous books.  The stories when they come out in the New Yorker, and interviews when there is one.  I think some of that shot me in the foot this time around, after all,  I did not get any money back for the stories I'd already read- one as far back as 2002.    What I usually love about Lahiri's work are her characters.  I have always been able to connect with them at a much deeper level, but with the exception of a few, there was really nothing much there for me.  There was a lot of storytelling as opposed to character building.  Some of the characters were drowned in high browed prose which is/would've been perfect for the character but not for me.  I am not studying for my PhD.  A great deal of Hema's last chapter dealt with her study, and a lot less with her personally- unless Kaushik was around.    It is also quite clear to see that the first story Unaccustomed Earth and Only Goodness were at one time related.  UE hints at the brother who has gone astray whereas OG explores the story of the \\"lost\\" bother- just with a different name.  I felt a little let down by this book because I feel it was patched together at best.  Perhaps Lahiri's publishing company was putting pressure on her to get something out and this is what we got.  While good, it certainly is no Interpreter of Maladies.  Maybe if this was my first time reading Lahiri, or perhaps if I glanced and enjoyed her stories in The New Yorker and decided to give her a try, I would've been very satisfied with this book, but my time and money has been invested much further and I was one of the few who was not satisfied.  Lahiri is still one of my favorite authors.  Her writing style will always soothe me, but I think she could have done so much better.  It's not a bad read by any means, but definitely it could have been better.  These are my opinions.

1401216676|4.0|I expected more from this reading. Alan Moore did take it another level with what he did to Barbara Gordon in this issue.  I found the ending anti-climactic.  The art and coloring were good.  I guess I've been spoiled by all the Batman cartoons and other Batman comics.
0399226907|3.0|The book was listed in Very Good condition.  I would say it was a little less than that.  Maybe even \\"fair\\" condtion.  I had to wipe it down a lot when I got it.  It was sticky!  My baby really loves it though (now that it's clean).
0385340567|1.0|I've been a big fan, but this was disappointing.  It was tedious, and repetitious.  Back and forth from town to town.  Running into the same characters, with almost the same dialog.  It seemed like half the novel was Reacher riding on a road, sometimes in a pickup, sometimes in police car, sometimes walking, sometimes hitchhiking.    Not even close on this one.
0385340567|5.0|I can't believe all the negative reviews out there for this book.  This may not be the BEST book in the series, but it is still a  pretty good entry in this long-running series.  I actually liked this book better than \\"The Hard Way\\" and  \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\". Of course, my favorites will always  be \\"Killing Floor\\" and \\"Tripwire\\".  I think some people are just trying to turn this into some kind  of \\"political\\" statement.  Give Lee Child and Jack Reacher a break!
1400064287|5.0|Made To Stick presents you with a template for making your communications be remembered by the listener. The advice is very practical and concrete, and easy to understand. I have already had the opportunity to apply the template presented in the book in order to improve presentations, and look forward to take advantage of this system many times more in the future. Note that this book does not teach communications skills, but rather which content to present to make it memorable.
B00164DWEA|4.0|After seeing the incredibly good superhero movie, Iron Man, in May, I knew any other superhero movies or summer action movies in general had a bar set high by such a good movie. The Incredible Hulk doesn't reach that level, but is surprisingly good as I went in with low expectations (particularly after seeing other genre movies not live up to the hype, as in Indiana Jones IV). Everywhere the 2003 Hulk movie failed, The Incredible Hulk seemed to succeed and give the audience what they were looking for.     As with Iron Man, the production values are high from Marvel Studios. The acting from Norton is what shines as it has always been important to empathize with the Bruce Banner character (something not easy to do with Eric Bana's emotionless performance). Also, the \\"fugitive on-the-run\\" aspect was always important, particularly in the TV series and to some part in the comics. That is very apparent here as it runs 30min. or so before the Hulk even appears (similar to Batman's appearance in Batman Begins, though not as long) and even then, it is in the shadows of a factory. (It did remind me a little of Iron Monger's appearance from the shadows in Iron Man. I do think Marvel tried and succeeded for the most part in tying both of these movies together with several references, though some would only be obvious to the die-hard fans of the comic.)    The acting from the rest of the cast is either appropriate for the character (Liv Tyler's Betty Ross) or somewhat over-the-top as with Hurt's General Ross and Roth's Abomination. (Also, noteworthy, Marvel seems to have used two villains in Iron Man and in The Incredible Hulk that are late generation villains instead of pulling some from the 40-year old depository. In fairness, Iron Man and Hulk have never had the most famous or memorable villains.)    The cameos from Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno are as enduring as ever, as a nod to the creator of and the first actor to play the Hulk.     This movie mixes enough drama and action to get to the heart of what makes this kind of movie work. Ang Lee tried to make a cerebral, artsy type of movie in 2003 and it failed to reach even the die-hard fans. The Hulk is what he is, a smashing, no-nonsense abnormality where action is a must.     The plot/story follows Bruce (Norton) as he is in South America looking for a cure to rid him of the Hulk. (They show how he became afflicted in the opening credits.) There is a nice roof-level chase through a run-down mountainous village that gets things going. Special forces force him to leave and head back to the states which is where the rest of the movie takes place and where drama is mixed nicely with action.     The CGI Hulk looks far better than the 2003 version. The interaction with the actors and the CGI Hulk is far more believable.     The musical score is a very good with one musical cue reference to the old TV show, which I thought was very nice.    The moments between Bruce and Betty are nicely done and seem more natural, less forced than the relationship in the 2003 movie. (It's probably because the acting is much better, and Norton plays vulnerable so very well.)    POSSIBLE SPOILERS, THOUGH DOUBTFUL      As stated earlier, their are significant cross-references with Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, with some being references to S.H.I.E.L.D.--the special military group in Iron Man; Stark Industries as the weapon supplier to the special forces team hunting down the Hulk; and the ultimate cameo of Tony Stark towards the end of the movie, suggesting a team is being formed--foreshadowing the inevitable Avengers movie.    END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS    As I mentioned, I went in skeptical, but came out very impressed. There were even audience members clapping afterwards, which I certainly didn't hear when Indy IV ended.     Go see it and help support Marvel Studios independent productions. With Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, there is a lot of promise for future comic book related movies.

B0013FSL2U|5.0|I treated my son and his 6 yr. old daughter(my granddaughter) to this movie today,and we loved it.<br /><br />Very,very funny,'non-offensive' humor throughout. The most consistent humor I have seen in a long time,and when was the last time that you heard the audience applaud at the end of a movie? They did after this one ended. Judging by all the laughter we heard,most,if not all were enjoying it very much.<br /><br /> It is also beautiful to look at. Wonderful writing and production values,all around.Deserves to win ALL the awards!<br /><br />If your family missed seeing this in the theater,be sure to treat yourselves to the DVD. I don't think anyone would regret it.
0385340567|1.0|Jack Reacher has become a sort of iconic American character, an impressive achievement no matter who the writer is. It's more impressive when you consider that Lee Child is British. Reacher is in some ways the quintessential American male - quiet, deadly, always on the side of right.    So what the heck happened to Reacher in \\"Nothing to Lose?\\" What a boring, politically correct, offensive load of claptrap!  Is Child so comfortable now that he has his $18 million contract for several more books that he feels he can just go ahead and alienate a large percentage of his readership? Or was it that his editor was embarrassed by the Reacher character and wanted to go in a direction more acceptable to his/her friends in an effort to get invited to more upper West Side cocktail parties?    I have purchased every Reacher book since I was introduced to the series several years ago, but I will be thinking twice now. Thanks, guys, for ruining one of my favorite characters.
B00005JKNC|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you are missing a great story!  The Majestic is definitely different from the normal Jim Carrey flick, but it's one you shouldn't miss.  For those who love nostalgic movies, this is a must see!

B000Z27HLS|4.0|For the first 15 or so minutes (maybe longer) I lived in hopes that this new adaptation of \\"Northanger Abbey\\" would stay closer to the original Jane Austen novel than the previous BBC production starring Peter Firth which had little of the wit of the original.  Perhaps it's impossible to do justice to Jane Austen unless one makes a miniseries the likes of the Colin Firth, Jennifer Erle \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". That said, Austen makes it quite clear in the novel that Northanger Abbey is an abbey in name only, that it is a modern, comfortable Georgian house with but the remnants of the original monastic building in the grounds - unlike the massive Gothic structure shown in the current version.    \\"Northanger Abbey\\" may be the slightest of Austen's works, however, even though this is an improvement on the previous attempt to present the piece on TV/DVD the novel deserves more than it gets in this version .
0743487486|5.0|In stead of. 'No, don't do that!' I think, 'Why not?'  My daughter and my husband an I have a lot more fun together now!  I  wish I could send this book to every parent.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|I thought the movie was good.  Yes, I am a fan of Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman and now Eric Bana (who is hot in this film) but it was nice to see the younger version of Henry VIII and not the crazy old man who once was king.  Plus, the movie is visually beautiful.  Anyone who is in to period films will most likely enjoy it.
0618918248|5.0|Very interesting book.  I was told every day that the Bible was FACT, raised in a Catholic school, etc.  It is good to see the other side of the argument.  Freed my mind!

B0013FDM7E|2.0|This movie was horrible.  The action did not pick up until what seemed like 2 hours later.  I am a fan of Will Smith and he acted well but the movie was horrible.  When it was over, I said \\"that was an hour and a half of my life I will never get back\\".  The only reason I gave it 2 stars vs 1 was for the special effects/CGI.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|there are 10 tracks, and the first track is instrumental. everything except 'viva la vida' and 'violet hill' is pretty much exotic/oriental/experimental. this album is surprisingly disappointing.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|If you keep an open mind, this can be one of the most enjoyable collection of songs released by any \\"metal\\" group in recent years.  Being a Priest fan since 1980, I had the typical WTF reaction when listening to the album for the first time.  I was expecting much of the CD to sound like the Nostradamus single, which is a combination of Hellrider & Ram it Down.  However, the CD consists mostly of beautifully crafted songs which introduce you, and build up to more emotionally charged tracks.  If you really listen to the music, you will enjoy Nostradamus more and more with each play.  While it is not a traditional \\"straight forward metal\\" priest CD, it is different, and a needed breath of fresh air.  Much more enjoyable than most of priest's recent catalog, and much better than the stale recent offerings  by groups like Def Leppard or Dokken.  The musicianship is outstanding, and Ian Hill can actually heard on many of the tracks!      Best Tracks -   Pestilence and Plague - great keyboard/synth accompaniment in the chorus. Full of emotion and very grand sounding.    Persecution - One of the few metal songs;  Halford's rant in the middle of song reminiscent of \\"free wheel burning\\"    Alone - Acoustic guitar and synthesizer track, accompanied by Halford's emotional, multi-tracked vocals.  This is the only song where he sings ahigh note.    For a good comparison, listen to \\"Framing Armageddon\\" by Iced Earth.
B000000OU6|1.0|I was really hoping this would be the Appetite For Destruction follow-up the Use Your Illusion albums couldn't manage to be. While the guitar work is unsurprisingly fine, the songwriting is lackluster at best, with memorable hooks or melodies in short supply. And what's the point of hiring as good a singer as Imperial Drag's Eric Dover if you're just going to have him do a second-rate imitation of Axl Rose? What a disappointment.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Though it may be unchivalrous to say so, \\"All I Intended to Be,\\" Emmylou Harris' latest album, has all of the earmarks of a late-period work. Surely only an artist with as long and varied a career as Harris has had can adopt such a reflective stance on the experience of life. The thirteen songs mostly describe dark stages of their singers' lives: broken hearts, suicidal thoughts, failed relationships, and abandonment. Harris strives mightily, through the communicative power of her voice and the quality of the music and lyrics, not to make this album a downer.<br /><br />I'm not sure she totally succeeds, but there's certainly a lot here that sticks in the heart and mind, especially as far as the songwriting is concerned. After the more eclectic sound explorations of her last few solo albums, Harris in \\"All I Intended to Be\\" comes full circle back to her roots, especially with work by \\"old five and dimers\\" such as Billy Joe Shaver and Merle Haggard included. \\"Broken Man's Lament,\\" the tale of a man who pays the price for thwarting his wife's ambitions, has the inevitability of a classic folk ballad. \\"How She Could Sing the Wildwood Flower,\\" co-authored by Harris and the McGarrigles, similarly evokes the classic Carter Family tune and lyrics in describing another husband deserted by his neglected wife. Patty Griffin (\\"Moon Song\\"), Jude Johnstone (\\"Hold On\\"), Tracy Chapman and Jack Wesley Routh (\\"Shores of White Sand\\") contribute memorable tracks. \\"Don't be tempted by the shiny apple/Don't you eat of the bitter fruit...'Cause all that you have is your soul,\\" admonishes Chapman in her song, and it seems Emmylou Harris has taken that advice to heart. Wherever she's gone with her music, it's been with her heart and soul.
B000J4QWNQ|5.0|omg, i love miami vice & i watched it so many times that i had to purchase it three times so far, beautiful action movie with romance, the romance between colin and gong li is so intese and so real,it's awesome with a sad ending, i enjoyed it soooooooooo much, i hope michael mann would make the sequel and i can't wait for it, god willing.      it's a beautiful movie which i enjoy watching over and over again.
B001437DMA|3.0|With the title I was expecting something a little funkier from Joe than what was delivered here. Like other reviewers I completely agree the stretch to re-create \\"Crowd Chant\\" once again, was clearly off the mark.  By itself and Live, \\"Crowd Chant\\" is enormously entertaining, brilliant and fun but trying to duplicate it to get the audience involved in every aspect of the show (what I think Joe was reaching for) isn't going to win over any new fans or critics.  Some of the tracks are good, melodic and even at times somewhat entertaining but this is not what I've come to expect from Joe Satriani.   I want to hear and feel that series of notes that grabs you by the throat and tells you simply \\"this rocks\\".  Maybe Joe is mellowing with age and his progression in music is taking him this route? I hope for my tastes though, it's only a lull in his career and not the defining moment we'll continue with from now on.   I would also agree he needs some fresh blood in his lineup and even in the studio especially. Bring in some collaborations as Carlos Santana has done, to challenge your catalog of work and see what fruit it bears. Whatever is missing needs to be re-discovered. I hate to say it but to date, this is Joe's lamest work and I've been a huge fan since day 1. Sorry Joe.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|what a beautiful movie oh god , i had to see this movie 5 times, what a sad story and what a brilliant acting done by will smith as always, this guy is a genius and the fact that the son was his real son made it even more real,  it made me cry , i can't say enough, how beautiful this movie was, another unbelievable golden acting done by will smith a perfect movie done by a perfect actor, i'll give it 5 out of 5 which is not nearly enough for that magnificent acting will did on this movie.
1400064287|5.0|Teaching is my passion and I am always looking for ways to make my courses relevant, accessible, and fascinating. When I came across a review of \\"Made to Stick,\\" I immediately recognized that the principles identified in the book could be adapted to my teaching. My courses will never be the same. From now on, even the most esoteric mathematical ideas and techniques will be presented using the principles expounded in \\"Made to Stick.\\" The book should be required reading for anyone aiming for professional and personal success. Of all the skills we need in this world, communication is number one. \\"Made to Stick\\" shows us how to become convincing and fascinating communicators. Preparing my lectures is now fun again.

0575081384|5.0|First I would like to congratulate the author on what has to be one of the best written and absorbing books I have ever read. I love how the characters come to life and you are absorbed in them so quickly seeing them for what they are \\"Real\\" people and not some sort of super hero. Cant wait for the second part!!!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Too little:  For such an anticipated release, ten tracks, one of which is instrumental, is a bit of a disappointment.  We always hope for more.  Too much:  The Coldplay we all love is here, just underneath what others are calling the oriental/latin/avant sound.  I get the impression, they added these layers to soften what was starting to sound too much like U2.  Overall:  Despite the overproduction, Viva La Vida will wear out your ipod.
073930402X|2.0|[[ASIN:073930402X Choke]] I am not usually made to feel sick by graphic imagery in a book, or any other form of communication. I felt sick with this book. This book speaks about sexual addiction (and other things). The descriptions were just too graphic for my tastes. I am surprised that I got through it, in the first place.     This book is definitely not for everyone.
B00000ILDF|4.0|This is really the type of movie I like to review. I remember when this came out, people seemed to be largely dissapointed. I wasn't old enough to see it in the theater, no matter how much it interested me. The theatrical release is an interesting edit of the director's original vision for the story. Unfortunately, the director's cut is presented poorly by Fox, and a grudge held by the director is evident in the absence of his commentary.     All that aside, Alien 3 is a terrific ending to the trilogy. I love the quiet, bleak atmosphere of the film. The effects are dated but have a charm of their own, somewhat akin to stop motion effects of the past. The creature design IS an HR Geiger design, and he's finally credited in this new special edition dvd. The Alien looks great, the movie looks great, and for me, this is a great ending to the series.

B000002J09|5.0|Jimmy Page and Robert Plant knew the band had something special when they completed the album. Each song holds incredibly well by itself with the exception of Four Sticks. The album contains many genres of music from rockabilly-inspired to folk-rock to music that technically did not have its own category. I think it is erroneous to Led Zeppelin as a Hard Rock or Metal band because their repertoire is rich with many varieties of music that they cannot simply be one type. It is comparable to calling the Clash solely a punk band or Neil Young solely as a folk artist. Led Zeppelin is just a rock band.    I will not discuss the songs individually as previous reviews have already done that. Zoso is simply one of the best Rock and Roll albums to have appeared in the century.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|Most of you reading this review have probably already heard the new single Violet Hill. That song only tells half the story of this amazing album. When we think of Colplay we typically think of plenty of piano solos and guitar riffs mixed around anthem sing-a-longs that easily fill an arena. That is what we have all come to love and expect from Coldplay. While Viva la Vida still offers some tracks that fall into that category it also exhibits the magnificent results that come from the band venturing out with fresh sounding ideas. This fresh sound comes naturally for a band that has matured with each album since their debut. The changes are subtle enough to prevent alienating the existing fan base. A few tracks highlighting this fresh new sound are \\"Strawberry Swing\\", \\"Life in Technicolor\\", and \\"Yes\\". The latter of which begins with Chris Martin singing in an uncharacteristically deep voice which sounds almost like a Dave Matthews song before changing to a normal, higher octave halfway into the song. Viva la Vida has a lot to offer everyone. Its highly orchestrated songs create levels of depth to Coldplay's sound that offer the richest music they have ever produced. This album could surpass X&Y as their greatest to date. Definitely don't pass this one up.
B00154GEFU|5.0|Being a big fan of Asia, and all the groups represented by the four original members, i love this new cd!.  It represents a lot of the great sounds i know and love from some fabulous musicians, and the style definitely brings back great memories.  I was glad to see Asia reunite, although a fan of their other work without the original members.  They are even touring so be sure to catch them if you can, Asia is a cant miss group and this new cd Phoenix shows that they have purpose and direction, and a great deal of talent continues to fuel their work.  I highly recommend this cd, Asia is a group for the ages!
0061537934|4.0|This book is tender, honorable and shows how important it is to do the right thing, no matter what.  I bawled for about 10 minutes after I read this book.  It's good for anyone to read!!!
0767020308|5.0|I saw this on PBS after I had read the book.  It is very faithful to the book, so I decided to buy a copy for my home video library.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is a very inventive show. It plays around with the idea of a killer with emotions. The twist is he is a cop, trying to solve murders. Of course, his own experiences help him solve those murders, and those experiences create problems for himself.    The show is really funny at times as well. Michael C. Hall does a great job balancing that humor with a serious tone when needed. The rest of the cast does a great job too.    If you're looking for something interesting that you'll want to watch to the great end, pick up Dexter.

0452289963|3.0|I have always thought what Mr Tolle has had to say was difficult to understand, I wish he would say it in a more direct way. As with his style of writing, reviewing what you have read always makes things clearer... then again sometimes not.
0743298039|4.0|Where was it that I read some publisher or the other averring that mystery readers were the most intelligent readers, in the sense that they read the books as if they were playing a game of chess with the narrator?  One false move, one miniature fault line in the plot, and dozens of letters would pour in pointing it out.  This indeed is how a good mystery should be read.  And this particular mystery has two narrators: the first, notoriously unreliable and on narcotics the entire time she spins her yarn, and the second a scholarly but naïve young woman.  And yet all these reviews seem to trust them, to go so far as to complain that the book ends with all loose ends tied up in a pretty box with a ribbon on top.  Does it really?<br /><br />Let me agree though that the book does well with the Bronte atmospherics, which I fail to see how any reader could fail to enjoy.  But it also immolates some High Victorian conventions.  It has often been noted that the one thing missing from Victorian paintings are the chamber pots, not to mention High Victorian literature.  This convention is trashed when John throws open the door to where Charlie has been hiding out, the mad man in the attic, one might say.---Flies, feces, the lot.  The book also has its droll moments, as when Dr. Clifton writes out a prescription for Margaret to read Sherlock Holmes to rid her of her Jane Eyrism, and when someone (I know you readers, judging by the reviews, think you know that it is Vida.  But can you be so sure?) replaces Hester's book with The Turn of The Screw.<br /><br />As everyone says here, this book is a very good read.  It has the soothing, rocking safety of...a lie, to quote Ms. Winter.  For those (apparently the majority of readers) who think that they, along with Margaret, have this all figured out, answer me one question:<br /><br />How did that treasure box find its way out of the fire?
B0018AK9RA|5.0|First off..I'm a Judas Priest fan since 1978 when I first heard Stained Class, now 30 years later I'm still a \\"Defender of the Faith\\", Priest have a produced a \\"Masterpiece\\"..I know some of you will argue this till the cows come home, but this is the kinda album I have been waiting for. It's alike a journey back to the early 70's with Sad Wings of Destiny, Rocka Rolla, Sin after Sin and so forth. There's no 4 chord \\"Hits\\" on this cd, Priest have really worked hard on making \\"Progressive\\" music on this album. If you want Painkiller, or British Steel then go put those albums on, because what you have here is a journey of Light and Dark Themes, some Agressive some very melodic and soft. Rob Halford has given you the perfomance of his life on this album, some beautiful compositions on this really make his voice shine. So if your into the more Symphonic, Progressive, Melodic Rock and Metal this will be to your liking. If you into the more Heavy Jugulator & Painkiller type then you'll be dissappointed...again I love Priest and I'm happy they did something different instead of the same old \\"Formula\\".<br />Highlights are:<br />Calm before the Storm<br />Nostradamus<br />Sands of Time<br />Death<br />lost love<br />Persecution<br />Exiled
B000YAA68C|5.0|This movie is another feather in Gerry Butler's cap - he's such a romantic along with all of the other 'things' he is.  As the story unfolds one gets caught up with many emotions and relationships and often laughs and cries at the same time.  Simply put, the cast is wonderful and the story will remain with you for a long time to come.
B000024T5L|5.0|I believe this was Europe's 5th cd and what a fine cd it was. You won't find the bombastic pop/metal of the two preceding recordings but this is very melodic and listenable material. There aren't any big hits on this like THE FINAL COUNTDOWN and OUT OF THIS WORLD but every single song's a winner on this release. Unlike the previous four albums, or at least the two before this one, you won't be programming your favorite four or five songs but listening to it all the way through. A VERY SATISFYING LISTEN. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This group is pure magic to both see and hear.  David Downes is the genius behind the presentation and we can only look forward to his continued brilliant contribution to the music world.
B0012Q732O|4.0|Okay, if your part of the masses that believe every single movie that's made has to have some historical basis then you're going to be very disappointed.   However, if you like to watch movies for the acting, for the effects and the suspence, romance and drama then this movie is great.    Yes, they speak english, but not every movie has the budget of Apocalypto. Yes, they look the same as us, but again not every movie has a crazy budget. Some producers/directors are more into how they can make us relate to the characters.   In todays world it's easier to relate if they A: speak the same language and B: look similar. Those things draw more people in.    So, if you want to be drawn into a movie just because it's good then see this.   If you're only watching it because you're looking for historical accuracy, don't bother, you'll be very disappointed.

B000003TAR|1.0|The other day a cat got jammed in my fanbelt when I was driving down the street and it sounded better than this abysmal album.<br /><br />The irony is that Nirvana...for all their phony anti-establishment nonsense...is nothing more than Britney Spears or Ashlee Simpson (or really Johnny Bravo from the Brady Bunch) talentless hacks who just so happened to fit the costume when the record industry was pushing their latest money making scheme....in the early 1990's the new fad was \\"I hate my parents; being a loser is cool\\" rock. To say this album is awful is like saying eating human dung makes your breath unpleasant.<br /><br />Honeslty, give your money to the CIA before you buy this album...at least they torture for a purpose.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|And assuming that we had no knowledge of any of Coldplay's previous 3 albums, and assuming that we had no idea of Coldplay's alleged greatness in today's music world. So without any comparison or benchmark, here's what I have to say.     \\"Life in Technicolor\\" is so aptly titled. An instrumental arrangement that gradually picks up in volume, texture and excitement, this album opener is so colourful it reminds you of a carnival. It gets your foot tapping and your head nodding. Some sources rumour that this song will be sung in words in Coldplay's next CD. The mood then glooms down when \\"Cemeteries of London\\" comes along. Sinister synthesizers flood the atmosphere and mysterious notes tinkle from the piano before the beats enter and the song erupts into a minor-key rock anthem. You'll find yourself singing \\"la la la la la\\" in no time. \\"Lost\\" bounds in, as track #3, with claps and a bouncy beat. Featuring some of the most intriguing lyrics (either deep or nonsensical will depend on you) - \\"just because I'm hurting, doesn't mean I'm hurt\\" and \\"just because I'm losing, doesn't mean I'm lost\\" - this song maintains the upbeat tempo throughout.     The mood becomes sombre once again at the beginning of \\"42\\". Apparently this is the favourite number of this band's lead singer. Anyway, by the time you finish pondering what makes 42, the number, so likeable, this song takes a sharp turn and rages forward, pounding drums screeching guitars and all. \\"42\\" finishes off back where it began - kinda like a fine day turning into a storm and becoming peaceful once again after the storm. Work of art. \\"Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love\\" is really 2 songs. \\"Lovers in Japan\\" sports a `happy' tune, with racing piano. If drums were replaced by a techno beat, it could easily pass off as the next hottest dance-pop tune in the vein of Dario G's \\"Sunchyme\\". \\"Reign of Love\\" is soothing, tranquil and relaxing. The vocals are gentle, cradled by softly played piano, all enveloped by warm synthesizers. Reminiscent of a walk in the garden in the evening.     \\"Yes/Chinese Sleep Chant\\" is once again 2 songs. \\"Yes\\" seems like it is sung by a different singer. Turns out it's not. Same singer, lower register. Interesting presentation. Dangerous sounding, minor-key tune. At the 1:33 mark, Arabic-flavoured strings add zest to the instrumental arrangement of the song. \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\" could easily sit in the track listing of the soundtrack to \\"Lost in Translation\\". Guitar distortion and feedback, pounding drums, and a faded yet ethereal voice makes listening to this track a giddying sensation. You could be hypnotised.     \\"Viva La Vida\\". Remarkably intelligent songwriting. Encapsulates originality, creativity, artsiness and yet retains every element needed for commercialism. Chorus is catchy as ever. The bell and strings stick in your head - for a long, long time. \\"Roman cavalry choirs\\", \\"Jerusalem\\" and \\"St Peter\\" will pop up in your head a lot. Come minute mark 3:00, when the band erupts into \\"Oh oh oh oh oh\\", the song lift itself into the stratosphere, sweeping you along with it. \\"Violet Hill\\" comes next. A dark, brooding rock song, A piano-laced song, sprinkled with distorted electric guitar and a mean guitar solo - I'm inclined to call this rock song of the year. A little U2, a little Phil Collins, a little White Stripes - brilliant.     \\"Strawberry Swing\\" starts like a folk tune. The beats enter like tribal drums. Can you see yourself dancing around the fire? Catchy melody, immaculate instrumentation. \\"Death and All His Friends\\" is a piano-based song that starts with a gentle lullaby-ish chanting and builds up into a soaring and memorable crescendo, as the album bids you good-bye with a reprise of \\"Life in Technicolor\\", entitled \\"The Escapist\\". \\"Death and All His Friends\\" reminds you what a thrilling ride your musical senses have just been on. By the time this CD leaves you, you'd be eager to push play again.     \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends\\" is a mostenjoyable listening experience that keeps getting better each time. Don't judge it in comparison to the 3 previous Coldplay CDs. This one is completely different but just as, if not more, haunting.     Liam   18 June 2008
B000001DV2|2.0|When John Bonham died...Led Zep called it a day...when Steven Clark died Def Leppard should have.<br /><br />This ablum is the Hysteria scrap heap (admittedly so by the band)...The band lost is chemistry (and all ability to write wicked riffs) when their most talented member, Clark, passed away. A true shame that one of the greatest bands ever continues to destroy their legacy because there is money to be made.<br /><br />Save your cash and buy High N' Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria...3 incredibly great albums.<br /><br />Joe Elliot said that after Hysteria (albeit much after) they could have released an album of Bee Farts and sold millions....Adrenalize has sold over 7 million copies...for an album so bad and so out of place in 1992, that speaks volumes for DL's enormous popularity in the late 1980's.

Work of art. \\"Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love\\" is really 2 songs. \\"Lovers in Japan\\" sports a `happy' tune, with racing piano. If drums were replaced by a techno beat, it could easily pass off as the next hottest dance-pop tune in the vein of Dario G's \\"Sunchyme\\". \\"Reign of Love\\" is soothing, tranquil and relaxing. The vocals are gentle, cradled by softly played piano, all enveloped by warm synthesizers. Reminiscent of a walk in the garden in the evening.    \\"Yes/Chinese Sleep Chant\\" is once again 2 songs. \\"Yes\\" seems like it is sung by a different singer. Turns out it's not. Same singer, lower register. Interesting presentation. Dangerous sounding, minor-key tune. At the 1:33 mark, Arabic-flavoured strings add zest to the instrumental arrangement of the song. \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\" could easily sit in the track listing of the soundtrack to \\"Lost in Translation\\". Guitar distortion and feedback, pounding drums, and a faded yet ethereal voice makes listening to this track a giddying sensation. You could be hypnotised.    \\"Viva La Vida\\". Remarkably intelligent songwriting. Encapsulates originality, creativity, artsiness and yet retains every element needed for commercialism. Chorus is catchy as ever. The bell and strings stick in your head - for a long, long time. \\"Roman cavalry choirs\\", \\"Jerusalem\\" and \\"St Peter\\" will pop up in your head a lot. Come minute mark 3:00, when the band erupts into \\"Oh oh oh oh oh\\", the song lift itself into the stratosphere, sweeping you along with it. \\"Violet Hill\\" comes next. A dark, brooding rock song, A piano-laced song, sprinkled with distorted electric guitar and a mean guitar solo - I'm inclined to call this rock song of the year. A little U2, a little Phil Collins, a little White Stripes - brilliant.    \\"Strawberry Swing\\" starts like a folk tune. The beats enter like tribal drums. Can you see yourself dancing around the fire? Catchy melody, immaculate instrumentation. \\"Death and All His Friends\\" is a piano-based song that starts with a gentle lullaby-ish chanting and builds up into a soaring and memorable crescendo, as the album bids you good-bye with a reprise of \\"Life in Technicolor\\", entitled \\"The Escapist\\". \\"Death and All His Friends\\" reminds you what a thrilling ride your musical senses have just been on. By the time this CD leaves you, you'd be eager to push play again.    \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends\\" is a most enjoyable listening experience that keeps getting better each time. Don't judge it in comparison to the 3 previous Coldplay CDs. This one is completely different but just as, if not more, haunting.    Liam  18 June 2008
B000003TA4|1.0|This album is the worst kind of trash....talentless noise...<br /><br />I swear we hate capitalism (hey david geffen, can you shoot us another million so we can make yet another overproduced, lame video for our target audience of 16 year old girls on MTV?)<br /><br />I cannot go on...the most over rated pile of rubbish ever recorded....not to mention it ruined the music scene forever....yuck...<br /><br />The only album that is worse is the barely decipherable In Utero.<br /><br />One final point....people seem to forget....the popularity of this trash was/is always massively overstated....this album sold about 9 million copies in the US....put another way...it would be Bon Jovi's Fifth most popular album.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater first and bought the dvd I enjoyed the story it had great special effects very visual I took my grandkids to see it also of course they liked it to.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I bought this album based on all the hype with no expectations.  I have to say that this is one of the rare cases where the music lives up to the hype.  Not only is it different from anything I've heard recently but it is also quite accessible.  I'm no fan of Paul Simon, but VW sounds nothing like him to me.  Anyway that's not how I listen to music.  I am a fan of bands like Interpol, Bjork, Raconteurs, and R.E.M.  If you want something that sounds like everything else on the radio then check out Britney Spears.  Otherwise for something fun, catchy, and original give Vampire Weekend a listen.
185984054X|5.0|When I met Christopher Hitchens at a conference in '99 I had just read this book. He said that he was surprised that no one had written it before because the hypocrisy and sanctimonious false modesty of Mother Teresa was so obvious to demonstrate.  She was so sanctimonious she didn't try very hard to cover her disingenuousness, but like anyone doing bad or hypocritical things in the name of the catholic church, the church's followers were glad to ignore the inconsistencies with ethical behavior she displayed, and the church itself loved the mountains of cash she brought in, often donated by the world's worst tyrants.  I told Hitch he was the only one with the huevos to write the book, and he thanked me.  What's too bad is that there isn't anyone else who wanted to write this book, Mother Teresa continues to get a pass even after she is long dead, despite the obvious evidence that she prayed out of both sides of her mouth.  Sainthood of course means nothing to me, but for those to whom it is important, if you'll grant it to this gal, you might as well grant it to the grilled cheese sandwich that looks like jesus.  It has the same meaning.
0316143472|3.0|This book was ok. Not as funny as \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" or \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\". The first few stories were pretty slow, but the  book picked up later on. The last essay, \\"The Smoking Room\\" was my favorite. It had the Dave humor I enjoyed in the previous books. I also liked \\"Solution to Saturday's Puzzle.\\"
0802714544|3.0|There is no question that Le Carre casts a unique plot with this book, and he keeps his spies very much on the human side.  He lets us into his characters' thoughts without giving anything away and they are not cartoonish. Although it is complelling, it becomes more of a puzzle and a history lesson about the cold war in the 60s than a genuine work of lasting literary value.  Le Carre can write an amazing sentence now and then, but a story so locked into the circumstances of the day it was written in creaks with a bit of rust after 44 years.  There are certain scenes and certain turns of phrase that put me off just a dash with their aged presentation, but I am old enough to remember the Berlin Wall and the machinations of both sides of the conflict, and it is a bit nostalgic to remember what things were like in the spy game before computers, satellites and cell phones.  Le Carre doesn't put his heroes through the ringer the way his contemporary Alistair MacLean did, but he can write suspensefully, and ultimately this novel satisfies the need for a good yarn, as well as challenging the reader to figure out what's going on before the book's hero does. The anticommunist preachiness that creeps in is also a bit much in light of the time that has passed and what has happened in the meantime, but that goes by fairly quickly.  It borders on melodrama without taking that final leap, but some of the dialog suffers all the same. It's a great taste of a bygone era of history, and of writing, and should be read as that.  If you're looking for the cutting edge of spy fiction, this book lies at the other end of the scale.  Anyone who writes a spy story owes Le Carre a debt for being one of the progenitors, but he didn't quite cross into literature territory the way Maughm did with the   Ashendon stories.
0060887966|5.0|I actually own the original Brazillian Portuguese versions of all of Paulo Coelho's books, including this one, O Alquimista (The Alchemist). Every one of his novels is a wonderful experience and if read at the right times in your life can be life changing. Having read Diary of a Magus (O Diaria de um Mago), Brida, and The Alchemist all at the right time in my life I find he is a beautiful writer, inspiring and soul lifting. He reminds me somewhat of Max Lucado in his ability to write to the soul and leave you renewed by the end of the journey. I truly suggest him for those searching for an unknown something. He may help you find it. Be open and accepting of the voyage. Enjoy the view along the way. The destination is worth it.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Accelerate is too short, poorly produced, highly derivative and not as good as some of REM's other albums (personal favourite: New Adventures).  On the other hand, there are no rubbish instrumentals, the sound \\"rocks\\", every tune is catchy (personal favourite: I'm Gonna DJ) and it is easily their best album since, well, New Adventures.  Awesome live show too.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|In the weeks leading up to this albums released I have read many professional reviews as well as reviews from fans about Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends. The one thing that all of the dissatisfied \\"customers\\" have in common is this.....\\"it is too experimental or it doesn't sound like \\"Parachutes\\" or \\"X&Y\\" etc. Well, I have one thing to say, if you want an album that sounds like \\"Parachutes\\" why don't you just, I don't know, listen to \\"Parachutes?\\"<br /><br />Imagine if all artists allowed themselves to be pigeonholed by the immature ears of their fans. Nobody would ever evolve and nobody would ever last longer than about 2-3 records. Radiohead would have died with \\"OK Computer.\\" \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends\\" is indeed Coldplay's first foray into \\"experimentation\\" and they pulled it off with a resounding success that leads me to believe that this band will be around for a very long while.<br /><br />Admittedly there isn't much here besides \\"Violet Hill\\" or \\"Viva La Vida\\" that can be considered a radio friendly single but who cares? It's 2008 and all of us listen to our iPods anyway. The first listen to this album floored me. I fell in love with it after listening to it a second time. If you have an open mind and a discerning ear you will love this album. The rest of you can go listen to \\"X&Y\\" for the thousandth time.<br /><br />My favorite tracks? Let's just say that in my iTunes library of over 1000 albums that \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends\\" is the FIRST ALBUM THAT GOT A FIVE STAR RATING ON EVERY SONG. Buy it people. You owe it to yourself and music this good deserves our patronage!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I am a musician, and this movie puts into words and action the magic I experience when I am onstage singing and performing. Music brings people together no matter what the circumstances, and the effects last for a lifetime! It drove me nuts to know that Evan was Louis' son, and he didn't know it when they were playing guitar in the park. Also, that was such a moving scene, it brought tears to my eyes! Imagine a father and son jamming on guitars in the park when neither one is aware of who the other is. Keri Russel is fabulous in how she portrays a love for music lost with the supposed loss of her son. Definitely get this movie~you will absolutely love it!
0515142247|3.0|An OK book, but not at the level of John Sanford. I got very tired of the author using the word \\"right\\" at the end of everyone's dialogue. It gets old after a while, right?
0316143472|5.0|I am sorry, this man has me laughing til I cry each time he tells a story about his life. The writing style is bliss to read. I waited forever for this book to come out and it did not let me down! WONDERFUL WORK once again David. Thank You!!!
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|This CD sucks...bad.  It sounds NOTHING like Coldplay, more like Paul Simon (who I can't stand).  The album is extremely boring and forgettable.  The best song on here is \\"Violet Hill.\\"  Still, it would be no more than the 4th best song on any of their other albums.  I'm a HUGE Coldplay fan, that's why it hurts so much to say that this album sucks as much as it does.  If you're expecting songs like Yellow, Clocks, Speed of Sound, Square One, you can forget about it.  The album is full of nothing but boring (aside from Violet Hill).  I like most of their slower songs, but these ones just don't have any feeling or emotion to them.  The album is full of fillers, unfortunately.    Overall, I rate the album a 1/5 simply because it's Coldplay and I can't give them lower than a 1.  However, if it was any other group, it'd get a .5 because there is almost nothing redeemable about this.  It's utter garbage, pure junk.  They need to stick with their formula from the previous 3 CDs.  You know, the style that got them to where they are today.  Too many bands change up their sound.  Usually (as is this case), the change is for the worse.  Too bad, I looked forward to the new album  and was highly disappointed.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Okay, Coldplay never actually ruled the world like the character in the song Viva la Vida, but they were on schedule to do so after the amazing Rush of Blood to the Head put them on the cusp of being the biggest band in the land. The only problem was the follow-up X&Y crashed under its own weight, instead of sounding like the greatest band out there, the album came off sounding like a Coldplay cover band.     Knowing they missed a golden opportunity, Coldplay scrapped the idea for the band and started anew; the result is Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends is much less piano, lead singer Chris Martin discovering his voice can do more than falsetto, and more experimentation than their first three albums combined. That experimentation could be attributed to Brian Eno who is the go to producer when you are trying to mix up your sound.     The change is ever-present from the beginning with the instrumental opener Life in Technicolor featuring a Persian santur. And it seems the band picked up even more influences on their world tour aside from the album title, cover and their poor man's French soldier get-ups they have been sporting everywhere lately. Cemeteries of London features clapping straight from Spanish flamingo dancers while Yes has a distinctive Middle Eastern fell to it. A bagpipe sound even creeps into the Beatlesque Strawberry Swing. But despite its title, Chinese Sleep Chant, the song doesn't have much in common with the Far East and is really the only song on the album that sounds close to classic Coldplay with its crushing guitars. Even then, Martin's falsetto is almost completely hidden under the rest of the band.     The writing gets a major overhaul on the album too with Martin's main go to of relationship topics are rare, instead were get songs about politics like the first single Violet Hill. But the majority of the album deals goes into U2 territory of religion and mortality with such lines peppered throughout the album like, \\"God is in the houses and God is in my head\\" (Cemeteries of London), \\"You didn't get to heaven but you made it close\\" (42) \\"I know St. Peter will call my name\\" (Viva la Vida) and \\"I don't wanna follow Death and all his friends.\\"     All these changes for the band collimate in Lost! a foot stomping anthem complete with organs straight from a church playing under some crazy percussion instrument. One change that is a little off is all the combination of songs, three of which have two distinctive songs complete with their own titles on the same track. Then there is 42, one name but with three section; the first that has an early Pink Floyd vibe, the middle sound like Radiohead circa OK Computer while the last is something completely new.     Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends may not give Coldplay biggest band in the world status (especially with a new U2 album coming out in the same year) but the album is the band's reapplication for that title. We will have to wait until album number five until we find out if they are finally accepted as such.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Violent hill song mesmerizing. Whole album worth listening as many time as possible. Lyrics of Viva la vida incredible ..one of the Coldplay bests
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Nostradamus is Brilliant... either you get it or you don't. The songs are awesome. Rob Halford's vocals sound as good as ever. There is alot to hear on this album. Yes Judas Priest stepped outside the box but that's why Judas Priest is so good. They are willing to take chances. If you want to hear classic Judas Priest Heavy Metal, This album has Nostradamus - Prophecy - Death - Conquest - Persecution - Visions and Future of Mankind. Plus there are some songs that sound sorta like Pink Floyd. Nostradamus has two CD's and is a bargain for the price.
B0015519VS|5.0|This cd is the best from track 1 all the way to the end.  Well worth buying.
0756404746|3.0|Maybe it began back in the early 90's with David Wingrove's `Chung Kuo' series, or with the advent of the `Harry Potter' series, or perhaps George R. R. Martin's `A Song of Ice and Fire'. But there's no escaping the fact that lengthy, multi-volume novels are all the publishing rage these days, and a glance at the SF / Fantasy shelves in any bookstore will reveal quite a few 500+ page monsters competing for reader attention.    `The Name of the Wind' certainly qualifies for the lengthy status, at > 700 pp. There are at least two more volumes in the \\"Kingkiller Chronicle\\" series to come.    So, apart from the fulsome praise from the publisher and select fellow authors that is plastered all over the cover and first few pages, how well does `Wind' deliver ? I have to agree with some of the other reviewers:  it's a readable book, but not necessarily the genre-surpassing masterpiece the hype would have you believe.     As the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire novel is one extended flashback as our hero, the moody genius Kvothe, relates his life story to the `Chronicler', in between breaks for beer and crackers, at the Wayside Inn bar.  There are childhood stories, some teenager stories, some Young Love, some Schoolboy Pranks, some Schoolboy Rivalries, some Confrontations With Authority, some Brushes with Destiny, and....... that's pretty much it.     If you're looking for typical `epic fantasy' fare , `Wind' doesn't deliver. No violent clashes between armies of dark and light; no dragons swooping over battlefields (although a rather underwhelming dragon does make an appearance); no lost cities filled with treasure, malevolent spirits, and phantoms; no goblins, dwarves, halflings, trolls, giants, undead (a single zombie shows up at one point in the story, but that's about it), elves, etc., etc. Indeed, the novel's most suspense-filled segment revolves around a lute-playing contest (seriously !).     If you're going to enjoy `Wind' then you'll have to be willingto read a deliberately-paced, character-driven narrative devoid of the action sequences common to most novels of this genre. The plot deals with the trials and tribulations of being a very bright young man in a medieval civilization in which magic is real, but subject to rational laws and restrictions (in a manner reminiscent of LeGuin's `Earthsea' novels). Portents of Doom periodically crop up in a very subdued fashion, but never occupy a central position in this volume. Since Kvothe is a kind of Fantasy Skill Decathlete, adept at magic, combat, alchemy, sneaking, thieving, rhetoric, smithing, and romance, most of the story's drama is derived from following his clever maneuvers for dealing with whatever obstacle or shortfall temporarily blocks his (predestined) path to greatness.     What makes `Wind' a tolerable read despite its languid pacing is Rothfuss's writing skill; he employs a clean, direct style devoid of self-indulgent mannerisms. Throw in short chapters, and a welcome decision to avoid burdening the reader with various neologisms related to the novel's setting (`Wind' lacks a Glossary), and the 700+ pages go by in surprisingly quick order.    Will I be in line for the next volume in the series, \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" when it is released next year ? Maybe. I can't get too excited with the thought of plowing through another 700- page, first-person memoir that indulges in such slow pacing. But if author Rothfuss can inject some more enhanced notes of liveliness and drama into his narrative, I may sign on. I guess I'll have to see....
B0018OAPAW|5.0|Here we have the Offspring's new album. After listening to it quite a number of times, I am very impressed with it.    I have been an Offspring fan for as long as I can remember, and now everyone is getting older and maturing, fans and the band alike. As a result, some of the songs in this album represent this. \\"A Lot Like me\\", and \\"Fix You\\" are the two songs that come to mind. Each portraying a much matured offspring sound, similar to that of U2.    That doesn't mean that everything has changed, \\"Your going to go far kid\\", \\"Hammerhead\\" and \\"Rise and Fall\\" bring us back to what the Offspring are all about - Punk.    This album is the product of a much matured offspring in my opinion. Dexter's vocals have improved immensely and the mix of guitars, piano and voice overs make this album a very powerful and exciting one for hardcore offspring fans and those new to the band also.    A highly recommended Album.
1402210086|3.0|Kitty Charing's guardian, the crotchety Mathew Penicuik, has promised that she shall inherit his fortune if she agrees to marry one of his great nephews.  Kitty, however, wants none of them.  What she does want is a trip to London, a place that she's never been.  So she arranges a hoax engagement with great nephew Freddy giving her a good excuse to go to town to meet his family.  Once in London she becomes a woman of fashion and gets entangled in all sorts of scrapes and misadventures.<br /><br />Overall, Cotillion is pleasant historical fiction that while rather loosely plotted is carried along by the strength of a charming cast of characters.  These include: the half witted but affectionate Lord Dolphington, foppish Freddy who has immaculate taste on everything from waistcoats to drapes, and the darkly handsome Jack, a notorious gambler and ladies' man.<br /><br />The story starts with Kitty dealing with multiple marriage proposals and matters of the heart. However, during the entire middle section of the novel her romantic future is put on hold as she plays cupid for others.  I felt as though this took too much focus away from Kitty as a heroine.  She pales a bit in comparison to the far more interesting couples and situations around her.  I got the impression of her as a kind hearted ing&eacute;nue, but not much more than that.<br /><br />Also I felt that Kitty and Jack's past and present relationship was rather poorly defined.  We are made to understand that they had some kind of involvement in the past, but the exact nature of it eludes us. Was it a simple school girl crush as Kitty insists? Or was it something deeper than that as Jack seems to believe? This is a problem when Heyer attempts a love-triangle conflict at the stories' climax.  Because we do not know whether Kitty really feels anything for Jack at all, there is a definite lack of tension, romantic or otherwise.<br /><br />In the end, Cotillion is more of a feel good story than anything else. Suspense is minimal, and the novel's true strength lies in the journey and not the destination.<br /><br />On a side note, there is a lot of unusual and (I suppose) period appropriate vernacular.  For example,<br />\\"Wonder if he's playing a deep game?.. No saying what might be in his head, a curst rum touch Jack! Shouldn't have thought he'd whistle a fortune down the wind though. Rather fancy he counted the old gentleman's rolls of soft his own. Never knew such a fellow for wasting the ready! Played wily beguiled with his own fortune!\\" Pg 48-49.<br /><br />Recommended if you love regency stories or light-hearted cozy reads.strength lies in the journey and not the destination.

B00164DWEA|3.0|Ang Lee's Hulk that first came out in 2003 left a bad taste.  Its convoluted story and wonky action pieces were just scratched the surface of the Hulk's universe.  One could say it was just a down right odd story from the start.  The Incredible Hulk is set to erase that from the memory of anyone who endured it.<br /><br />Here we see Edward Norton step in the role of Bruce Banner rather then Eric Bana.  Norton brings little new to the lead role but does manage to have some fun with it.  It might sound odd seeing him in the role but all in all is a good fit.  Jennifer Connelly is replaced with Liv Taylor and to be honest doesn't really matter.  I like Connelly better but either one of them could've been replaced by anyone else seeing that Betty Ross doesn't bring anything to the table.  Then there's Tim Roth, who replaces Nick Nolte as the bad guy in the film.  Roth's Emil Blonsky (Abomination) steals the show every part he's in.  Roth's Emil is even better to watch then the Hulk.  Roth hasn't been this cool on screen in a long time.<br /><br />The major draw to this film is the action and this time around the movie doesn't disappoint.  No longer do we have to wait a good hour to get a glimpse of the green giant.  Since the gamma radiation has taken effect before the beginning credits even end.  The F/X team did a good job with the set pieces and director keep the focus tight and fast paced, making this one of the better summer movies of 08.  That's saying something in the summer of Iron Man and a new Indiana Jones movie.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|The biggest problem with I am Legend is the same problem that Hollywood had with The Omega Man. All they have to do is to make the book from Richard Matheson into a film and don't add anything or take anything. Yet both times they have tampered with the material and both times they end up producing less than average results.<br /><br />A doctor finds himself almost alone in a city trying to find a cure for a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong turning people into starving rabid but rapid zombie-ish type creatures that run through the night killing people. The action sequences are mostly of the nightstalker hunting or cure finding sort. Lots of the time Will Smith is left talking to himself, his dog or having flashbacks before the plague.<br /><br />This latest attempt at I am Legend is not an outright disaster. The empty New York set design and Will Smith do save the dodgy CGI nightstalkers and a script that simply deviates too much from the original concept. It is still something you can watch, maybe even enjoy at times, but that is not the point. This is not I am Legend and that is bad because this simply isn't the film we wanted to see and it's the second time Hollywood has got it terribly wrong. It makes matters even worse that we have been waiting over 12 years for it since an Arnie version was announced but then dropped. Third time lucky maybe but not even three stars for this effort.
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|No matter how well this plot might have been (and I must admit, it was strangely intoxicating), there is one undeniable truth that resonates from this film like the white, thick puss from a zit, and that is the fact that a guy who looks like Nicholas Cage, receding hairline and 44 years worth of aging and ape-like facial difficulties to deal with, and a gal like Miss Biel, 26 years old and quite possibly the most beautiful actress under the age of 30, would never, never, never hook up within their first six lifetimes of living together, let alone their first day together as this film tries to sell us on (I know, this is the longest run-on sentence in Amazon history). Only in Hollywood, people, only in Hollywood.<br /><br />Think about it. The film spins Cage's character's advances in a funny way, but to propose that he would have a one in a billion chance with a woman so stunning was enough for me to discount anything else the film tried to peddle. I could see them becoming friends, I could see them becoming good friends, but getting their groove on within the first half-day of meeting? PaaLEASE! No way does that happen in reality. Never.<br /><br />Gary Goldman, the man responsible for writing the main portions of the screenplay, is the guilty party here. He just had to take a very well-made film and throw the most unbelievable romantic plot development since Elisabeth Shue's character going for Cage in Leaving Las Vegas (I know, I'm not very nice to Cage).<br /><br />That being said, that DVD box is in and of itself worth buying. My gosh, whoever marketed that shot of Jessica in that shirt should get marketing executive of the year or something.
B0015519VS|5.0|Unbelievable. This is one of those cds that you have a tendency to keep playing over and over and it never gets old. It has some very tight beats, amazing singing and impressive featured artists. I think this cd is actually better than Confessions, and that was a classic. This is his next masterpiece.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|There's a lot to like about Katy Perry. Her song \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" is reigning high on the iTunes chart right now. For those unfamiliar with her, I'd place her sound and style in the genre of pop. Her sound is reminiscent of 80s pop and with a bit of a edge that makes her comparable to other new acts like Sarah Bareilles. Don't be fooled by the cover; Katy Perry's music is far from frilly and girly. In fact, often times it's the opposite as she spins out songs and lyrics that have caught the attention of pop royalty such as Madonna.<br /><br />What you'll like about \\"One of the Boys\\" is the chances Katy Perry takes with her lyrics. The song \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" isn't truly groundbreaking or edgy but it's a rock-style song with Perry bending gender a bit, taking on the position of a 'girl gone wild' whose just out to have fun and experiment rather than looking for love. The other stand-out song \\"Ur So Gay\\" plays with the beat, with Perry's voice dripping and hanging off words and phrases as she rips into her loving boyfriend whose qualities brings questions to her mind. This is what makes Katy Perry so appealing; her music doesn't sound like anything being played on American radio and sounds very fresh and appealing to all audiences. Other stand out songs are \\"Lost\\" which is rather ballad-like without being overly mushy and features some great vocal work on her behalf, the very 80s-pop orientated \\"Mannequin\\" and \\"Self Inflicted\\".<br /><br />What you may not like are the down-tempo songs that definitely feel like a let down compared to her up-temp songs. While these are okay, they distract and feel like filler-tracks or like something that any other new-act would put out. They sound far too safe for an artist that has the ability to pen some great lyrics and match it to a unique and fun beat. These tracks make the cd drag out and feel a bit unbalanced.<br /><br />In all, a great debut that deserves your attention and is worth your money. Check it out.

I didn't know Victor Wooten was such a sweat person before he let us know what he has in his mind about music and about life by writing this book and sharing it to us. I thank him a lot! The book is so fluent and easy to understand even if your main language is not English. It is so sincere also. I'm sure you'll like it and it will be a great motivation for all your music life.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|As a fan from Coldplay's very early days (I still have \\"Parachutes\\" as one of my favorite albums of the last decade, and I saw the band's second ever US gig, in February 2001 in Portland, OR), I have to admit that I was somewhat apprehensive about the new album, which has been widely touted as Coldplay's 'experimental' album. One of the things touted was that the album would feature sounds recorded in a Barcelona church, as if anyone really cares about that, in the end we just want to hear good songs/a good album. So.... three years after \\"X&Y\\", finally comes Coldplay's 4th studio album.<br /><br />\\"Viva la Vida or Death and All of His Friends\\" (10 tracks, 46 min.) starts off with a 1-2 blast of the soaring instrumental \\"Life in Technicolor\\" and the equally great \\"Cemeteries of London\\". \\"Lost!\\" finds Chris Martin pensive (\\"I May Be Losing/But I'm Not Lost\\"). The album centers around the two long tracks into the middle: \\"Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love\\" (2 separate songs stapled together for whatever reason, with \\"Lovers in Japan\\" reminding me of U2's \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", courtesy of producer Brian Eno) and \\"Yes\\", which also features 2 different songs, albeit under the same name. \\"Viva La Vida\\" (2nd single, also featured in the iPod commercial, prompting Coldplay to its biggest Billboard Hot 100 success ever at No. 3) is a nice dreamy song. \\"Violet Hill\\" (1st single) is for me the best song on the album, even without it being catchy as such. The album's closer \\"Death and All of His Friends\\" crashes in after a pensive beginning and  also includes the 'hidden' track \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\", which reprises the\\"Life in Technicolor\\" theme, and a nice way to round off the album.<br /><br />In all, this album makes clear that this is not the Coldplay of yesteryear. Even \\"X&Y\\" sounds dated by this. There isn't a single \\"catchy\\" song as such on here. \\"Speed of Sound\\" from \\"X&Y\\", the last link to the earlier Coldplay instantly recognizable sound, sounds far, far away now. No falsetto singing from Chris Martin is to be found here. This is the new Coldplay. \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All of His Friends\\" is intended what U2's fourth studio album, 1984's \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", was intended to be: a nice break with the previous band's output, paving the way for more ambitious future outings, and on that level, Coldplay definitely have arrived. Whether Coldplay has an album like U2's next album, 1987's \\"The Joshua Tree\\", in them remains to be seen. But this album sure feels like Coldplay is up to it. I am in for the ride.tto singing from Chris Martin is to be found here.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay's 4th album, Viva La Vida, has been long-awaited since its predecessor X&Y was released in 2005. I took this CD to work this morning and played it over and over while I worked to get a good feel of the album before I made any conclusions about it.    The results?    Viva La Vida blew me away. Rarely does a new CD so quickly hit home where every track is playable continually without having to skip around to the \\"good ones\\". Off the bat you notice that this album is far different from the others as the opening track \\"Life In Technicolor\\" strays far away from the previous openers such as \\"Don't Panic\\", \\"Politik\\", and \\"Square One\\". \\"Life in Technicolor\\" beautifully introduces us in just the right way to this wonderful album with a instrument-only style and a progressive build-up like nearly all the songs on the album.     I can't get enough of this album plain and simple. It really hits home. When I first heard that they were changing their sound I thought they were going to go back to their softer roots from Parachutes. However, they didn't go backwards but forwards and made one the most splendid mixes I've ever heard. Some favorites are \\"Cemeteries of London\\" with its dramatic-dark storytelling drawing comparisons to the classic \\"House of the Rising Sun\\". \\"Lost!\\" is a sure-fire popular choice among the fans as being a heartfelt ballad with plenty of nice lyrics. \\"42\\" stars off very dark and very mellow then all of a sudden picks up with a mega-fun beat that turns into a pop-ish song that is undeniably fun to listen to...but ends on the note that it started on. One of my personal favorites has to be the next track \\"Lovers In Japan\\". This song is what I think of when I think of \\"raw and unique Coldplay\\". It is a song that seems written for some movie soundtrack out there and is one of the most dreamy, great songs I've heard before. It is quickly climbing the charts as one of their best. The 2nd part to Lovers is \\"Reign of Love\\" - a soft, heartfelt ballad from the likes of Parachutes, Green Eyes, and Sparks. Its a really pretty, soft song that balances the dark, hard sound of the album. \\"Yes\\" is their most experimental song to date as it makes great use of the slide guitar that Jonny plays brilliantly. It's a nice, steady Oasis-sounding song that also features some nice strings in the background. The next track \\"Viva La Vida\\" is obviously the fan favorite out there now as it was features in the iTunes commercial with all the pretty colors and effects. This is truly magical song and the mysticism behind it really draws you in. I love this song but I have a fear that it will be over-played on the radio. Overall its a very powerful song though. \\"Violet Hill\\" was their first single to be released and there's not much more to say to it other than it's a solid, edgy rock song that sounds U2-ish with some Oasis. It's a good song...just not as innovative or unique as the rest of the album. Definitely a good edgy rock song though with the Coldplay guitar-whine in the background. As Chris Martin put it...\\"its a Jonny-fest\\". The next track is \\"Strawberry Swing\\". This is them trying to be The Beatles. It is a pretty, and relaxing song...it isn't their strongest song of the album. The final song is \\"Death and All His Friends\\". This song is actually an awesome song and one of the best sign-offs I have ever seen on an album...not just a Coldplay cd. Its an amazing song. It has about three different stages throughout the whole song and puts an awesome cap to an awesome CD.     Overall, this CD left a HUGE impression on me that no other Coldplay CD did when I first heard them. I had to really get used to X&Y. However, many buyers will have to really get used to this CD if they only know Coldplay through the radio (Clocks, Yellow, Fix You). The sound is really different and unique and blew me away. As Eno said, \\"This is the CD that Coldplay will be remembered with.\\"    5/5 stars.
0385338724|5.0|Love Sophie K!  Have been waiting for this release for a while.  A bit predictable, but still was hard to put down.  Read it all in one day.
0385336691|4.0|No doubt, this author can write as sharply as anyone, and about almost any subject. From his super-tough dialogue to descriptions of English country and NYC, he is one right-on author. This plot, about a very unusual kidnapping, has all the twists and bounces you'll ever need, and it all fits together, even the red herrings, and small clues apparently of no interest, until the plot is finally resolved. Why only 4 stars? To this reader, maybe a squeamish one at that, the end does get a little too sadistic and rough, approcaching a bad cartoon. But for rough and tumble scenes, fine descriptions, and matchless characterizations, this one's a sure winner, even with the blood and guts overdose towards the end!
0385491026|5.0|Cat's Eye / 0-385-49102-6<br /><br />I've read that \\"Cat's Eye\\" is supposed to be Atwood's most autobiographical novel, and it certainly shows. The book is a long one - well over 400 pages - but it flies by quickly. Atwood lingers over lavish descriptions of childhood loneliness and the cruelties which are so often inflicted by children; for readers whose childhood was characterized by a loving home but with unbearable peers, this book will strike a deep chord.<br /><br />As a child, Elaine is constantly berated by her companions. She frequently feels unhappy and yet is unaware of her unhappiness, unable to process the fact that her \\"friends\\" are not friendly to her at all. She develops body dismorphic disorder: chewing her fingers, peeling off the skin from her feet, and developing a small appetite and an inability to keep her food down. Her mother recognizes that her child is unhappy, but feels powerless to confront the underlying problem, and once the damage is done and internalized, Elaine's problems seem destined to remain with her into adulthood.<br /><br />Internalized feelings of self-hate and depression are difficult to exorcise, and even as an adult, Elaine remains conflicted over the years with regards to her rights, her worth, and her defects. Her relationships with men are strained and difficult; her timid approach to feminism is stymied from her fear that she hasn't \\"suffered enough\\" to be included in the ranks. Even her own paintings - hailed as incredible feminist icons - plague her with guilt and doubt.<br /><br />\\"Cat's Eye\\" is a wonderful treatise on the nature of guilt and childhood anguish, and how the scars obtained in childhood can stay with a person forever. No answers are offered, just a mirror to reflect the reader's own doubts back at them.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
0671015206|1.0|While the book has some interesting insights into the wealthy, what is the point of amassing a fortune if you're living well below your means? If you're looking to make some money I recommend you read some books on investing. Phil Town's book \\"Rule #!\\" is a great book based on the same investment strategies that Warren Buffet uses.
B0018OAPAW|3.0|All of The Offspring's albums over  the last decade have been comprised of equal parts traditional SoCal hardcore punk rock and bubblegum power pop. While Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace is no exception, the distinction between the two disparate genres has never been greater. Tracks one through six are shining examples of what The Offspring have always done best: pen empowering, up-tempo anthems of protest enlivened with melodic choruses and infectious hooks. Half-Truism blends the band's patent hardcore punk style with Danny Elfman influenced undertones reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas, while Hammerhead is a masterfully crafted two-part punk rock epic dealing with subject matter that praises troops while condemning war. Generally, the first half of the album is essential listening for any fan of the band's early work, staying true to their OC punk roots while experimenting just enough to keep things fresh without alienating their die-hard audience. Unfortunately that much can't be said for the second half of Rise and Fall. Kristie, Are You Doing Okay? is an overly earnest ballad that finds the group pandering to fans of The Plain White Ts' Hey There, Delilah. And while excursions into heart-on-sleeve balladry may work for artists more inclined to write sensitive singer/songwriter type material, it doesn't quite have the same appeal coming from a group of aging punk rockers. Nothingtown is an atrocious example of a talented, competent band regressing into 90s Good Charlotte-esque pop-punk territory and Stuff Is Messed Up is an almost laughable attempt at the group trying to rewrite Come Out and Play for the MySpace generation (yes, you really did hear Dexter Holland spell out the phrase \\"LOL\\" during the bridge). While the second half of Rise and Fall may be egregiously misguided and often cringe-inducing, the first six tracks on the album represents some of the finest work the band have written since 1994's Smash.  And, at the veryleast, those songs have been well worth the five year wait since The Offspring's last album.
B00005M91K|5.0|If I could only own one dvd in the world, this would be it.  No words can describe the emotions and feelings that run through you when you see the film. The closest description would be a cerebral journey through the subconsciousness.  I am a better person for having viewed the film.
B000063UR2|2.0|If this film had been blessed with a cohesive, original plot and adequate writing to match its truly breathtaking cinematography and art direction, it could have been a classic.    Instead, it was a gigantic commercial and artistic failure for director Ridley Scott and...well, practically everyone involved. Tom Cruise--at the time hot off the 'Risky Business' craze--was lucky to have escaped with a career after this massive blunder.    The story? Well, an evil Satan-type named \\"Darkness\\" wishes to put the kibosh on sunlight (his destroyer) by killing a couple of unicorns and kidnapping a hottie-Princess while he's at it. Thwarting his plan are a scraggly \\"forest-child\\" (Cruise) and a gaggle of elvish midgets (or Little People). That's the story/plot. The dialogue is even worse. Stilted, and full of more vacuums than a black hole, the writing and pacing is hideous, under-developed, and throwaway.    Sadly, this need not have been the case. Strictly visually, this is an absolute triumph. Utterly beautiful, captivating, surreal, exquisite, almost operatic, if you will. Sets, locations, costumes, scenery--all achingly superb. To watch this film with the sound turned completely off while playing something from Mozart is to trip the light fantastic, as they say. What you \\"see\\" is the genius of Ridley Scott as a visual film-maker. What you \\"hear\\" and perceive is one of the most bafflingly awful scripts ever thrown (like cold spaghetti) against a film of this expense and presumed ambition.        The performances are at the mercy of the bad bad writing, though David Bennent as Gump manages to wield the charisma pretty well. Cruise is awful. Mia Sara briefly engaging. Billy Barty criminally underused. Tim Curry is unintentionally, hysterically hammy in his scenes as Darkness (except maybe during the otherwise badly cut \\"wooing\\" interlude with the madeover princess). Alice PLayten as Blix is impressive, but mostly because of the genuinely frightening costume. The unicorns manage to get all of their lines right. The chick who played the fairy, Oona, is convincing. Whomever was inside the Meg Mucklebones costume was VERY convincing.         Anyhow, this deluxe version features the theater-cut and the remastered Director's Cut, and it must be admitted that the added scenes in the latter DO help the story make a little more sense, flesh it out a bit more, but it's still a comparatively crappy tale. It's also debatable whether the original score is better than the cool Tangerine Dream score that was eventually used for the film's commercial release in the '80s. Both have their merits, but neither can save the meat & potatoes of this paradoxical flick.    The consolation is that it is so mesmerizingly beautiful that every fan of fantasy MUST own it and cherish it for this quality alone. It's almost Felliniesque in its power to visually entrance the viewer. I'm telling you again, if there had been a savvy story, proper pacing, and worthy dialogue, this could have been up there with Scott's immortal cult classics. But it ain't.     Get it anyway if you're a Scott and/or fantasy buff, or get it for the real young kiddies who won't care how utterly wretched the writing is, and so you can scare them senseless. Young and old will be glued to what they see on the screen and thrilled by that alone.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I honestly don't know why people have such mixed feelings over this movie.  It's artistic and wonderful.
B00003CXDD|3.0|This Lucas-written, Ron Howard-directed \\"epic fantasy\\" is one of those commercial flops that actually came to find a sizeable cult-following in the years after its theatrical run--whether via TV-showings, VHS, or now in this bright DVD incarnation.       Yes, the plot is totally derivative: savior-babies in reed baskets; halfling-types who must be brave enough to \\"carry\\" a serious burden on their shoulders; Brave but exiled swordfighter; Evil sorceror with equally evil General. Yeah, yeah, we get it. But Willow is not as unoriginal as 99% of the lame movies made these days, and all in all a fun, engaging adventure/fantasy flick with some believable performances that sort of lift it up to genuinely \\"beloved\\" status.        For the scope of the thing, it's not too badly plotted. Things happen at a nice click, and happen reasonably. The effects are dated now, but a few were actually groundbreaking at the time (the Raziel \\"morphing\\" scene).        In terms of the tale, a mysterious newborn Princess is being hunted by a sorceress queen named Bavmorda, and for good reason. There's been a prophecy that the infant will one day bring about her destruction, and the queen needs to obliterate the kid's soul with a spell. With the help of an ill-fated midwife, however, the babe is floated down a river until it reaches the home of a dwarf-farmer (a \\"Nelwyn\\") named Willow.         Reluctantly, Willow takes a shine to the babe and is swept-up in the adventures required to preserve her life from the wicked queen, her henchman, Kael, and her sexy-ginge daughter, Sorsha. Willow is enlisted to carry the baby to the world of the Big People, but gets waylaid by a spectral fairy-lady who apparently can't leave her forest to fight Bavmorda, but gives the midge a powerful wand and tells him to deliver it to a rival sorceress named Raziel, who can use it to oust Queenie and save the baby.        Along the way, of course, Val Kilmer enters the picture as the surly but eventually loyal warrior, and they are accompanied by two annoying \\"brownies\\" from Fairyville who are akin to mosquitos, in terms of being welcome additions to the story. Anyhow, they find the good sorceress, only to discover that she has been whupped by Bavmorda and turned into a possum (of all things).        The story then shifts toward Willow's need to get the baby safely to a fabled castle called 'Tir Asleen' and learn a touch magic so he can use the crooked wand to re-morph the good witch. None of this is successful and, several battles, snowboardings, and double-headed dragons later, the baby gets stolen and the goodies ride to save it, right up to the gates of Bavmorda's castle. (Sound familiar?)       Snatching a trick from Circe of Greek myth, Bavmorda puts a spell on the whole army and turns them into pigs--even her own daughter, Sorsha, who got the hots for Val Kilmer and defected to the good camp. Willow escapes pigdom and finally gets the hang of the wand. He painstakingly transforms Raziel back to human form, where she is a bit miffed to discover that she has, in fact, become a wrinkled old baggage. Even so, she's got some mojo and appropriates the stick from Willow, restoring the army. The final battle in the castle is well-filmed, as is the tense showdown between the rickety old witches. A cute little plot twist comes at the end, but nothing super-spectacular.       This is basically a cute Lucasfilm that is marginally less hokey than the Ewoks. That's a good thing. Ron Howard does a good job directing and James Horner does, too, with the grand score. Warwick Davis (later of \\"Leprechaun 1, 2,3,4,& 5 fame) does a worthy acting job here (especially since he's essentially \\"carrying\\" the picture--which was his first and must've been tough). Other performances are standard: Val Kilmer gets the job done but seems bored; Billy Barty is his usual sweet old self. Brit actress Jean Marsh is genuinely scary as Bavmorda--just the right amount of simmering evil without getting too hammy. Patricia Hayes lends great dignity as old-biddy enchantress Raziel. Call me sentimental, but I thought the most moving performance in this film was by one of the other \\"little\\" folk--the actress who plays Willow's wife, Kaia.     This sturdy action/fantasy/adventure has got loads of nice but generic Lucas mythical touches, and lots of chummy Ron Howard dependability. A keeper for young and old, if not a classic, by any shake of the stick.
B0015519VS|5.0|He has truly grown over the years and it shows excellent CD and the teens still love him and us grown and sexy do too!!!
B000001DYJ|3.0|This CD rocks for what it is. I can kinda get into it, so it'll stay in my KISS collection. I've written before that i'm a biased 70's era KISS fan and i dislike the most of the 80's stuff and 90's Revenge. BUT this Live CD rocks in it's own right, i gotta say. It doesn't have that Rock and Roll Garage Spirit of the original Line up, But I dig the Energy on this disc, doctored/overdubbed or not. Again, it by no means has the raw power of the original KISS ALIVE...and I miss Ace on these tracks A LOT, but it's a pretty good CD for what it is.
B0018OAPAW|2.0|I have liked The Offspring for a long time, but I have to say that I can't even listen to this album because of how badly the bass was mixed/mastered. Someone didn't know what they were doing when mixing the music for this. Don't even try to listen to this album if you own a high-end stereo or if you have a quality subwoofer because the recordings are so muddy, it's unbelievable. The kick-drum is way too boomy and it clashes with the sound of the bass notes so all you get is rumbly, muddy sound.<br /><br />Of course, if you do not own a high quality stereo and you're just listening to this on your iPod headphones, it will probably sound fine. I only gave it a 2-star rating because it's The Offspring... I should give it a zero for sound quality.<br /><br />I think the users should know whether or not to spend the money on low sound quality music if they own a nice stereo. You know, to some people the sound also matters just as much as the song-writing and lyrics. Sorry for the negative review, but I don't want other people making the same mistake I made.
B000002MTU|5.0|\\"Clapton is God\\" used to be scrawled on the subways and phone booths of England in the 1960s.  From the Cradle shows why.  A tour de force of blues solos and techniques, Clapton shows why he is the master of rock and blues guitar, without ever sounding derivative.  From the opening slide licks of Blues Before Sunrise through the incendiary riffs of Five Long Years and down to the syncopated jangling of Motherless Child and the choogling grind of Drifting, Clapton lays out the entire blues vocabulary in one tight, very listenable CD.  Knowing that every song on here was done in one take with only minimal overdubs only makes this album all the more legendary.  A must-have for any student of the blues.
B000PTYP5C|2.0|Apparently DT didn't exhaust their need to do a darker, heavy metal album with Train of Thought since most of this album - with a couple of exceptions - definitely feels about the same as the Train of Though material. What probably hurts it the most though is the lyrical content which most of the time sounds like a Syphony X song gone horribly wrong. (And I really like Symphony X)<br /><br />I mean seriously we go from tribute to 9/11 (Sacrificed Sons) to Stem Cell (The Great Debate) to lots of other intelligently written issues to \\"Dark Master, now my soul is yours...\\" Really? So are we intentionally shooting for the 13 yr old metal-head-wannabe demographic?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there was definitely some good moments to the album and I love their tribute to Muse (Prophets of War) and they've got some great musical movements here and their but overall I definitely felt like this album doesn't represent their best work.<br /><br />As a frame of Reference, I'd rank the DT albums thusly.....<br /><br />Scenes from a Memory II - clearly their high point<br />The last 4 songs from Octavarium - as good of 4 songs as they've ever written.<br />Images and Words - Classic<br />Six Degrees......A few clunkers but mostly excellent<br />Train of Thought<br />Systematic Chaos<br />Awake<br />Change of Seasons
B00005JPTK|5.0|I am legend is not a bad movie at all.  It does remind me of a dawn of the dead kind of thing but in a good scense.  It's not bloody and makes you wonder.  I found it to be a good movie worth buying after theaters.
B0018AK9RK|4.0|But this won't be one.  It makes me sad to read some of these reviews stating that this is the end of Judas Priest.  How often do you hear Priest on the radio anyway? What's keeping them going is the true Priest fans that still buy there music and go to their shows.  With this purchase you get a code for a free General Admission ticket to THE METAL MASTERS TOUR.  This is a conceptual album about the life of Nostradamus, that means that it is telling a story for those of you that don't understand.  I knew from the start that it would be slow and fast combined, but it is still Judas Priest.  I think that the way it is mixed together in this time and age makes it a masterpiece plus I like the hardcover book that came with the collectors set.  It's got some awesome artwork, the story of Nostradamus, and all of the lyrics.  The discs slide into a sleeve in the front and rear of the book.  I gave it 4 stars because I do believe that in some parts between songs that is does drag on a little but I am very impressed how this project came out.  Also with my free ticket I know that I will be banging my head to all of the classics in August in San Antonio, Texas.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|One of the absolute best artists of their generation. I'm currently 28, my Dad is 61, and we both love this album. If you're a fan of classic rock, especially Led Zeppelin but also Jethro Tull, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, or any of those old bands with the crunchy, awesome guitar and unstable, unique vocals, you'll be surprised by the intelligent homage to those greats that is Wolf Mother. With such a heavy LZ influence, they could be accused in some ways of being a Led Zeppelin imitator, but when you think about it, isn't that an incredible compliment anyway? And as opposed to the thousands of actual copycats with no real skill or originality which seem so plentiful these days, wouldn't you rather hear a bunch of guys who are not plagiarists, but are skillful enough to achieve a style very similar to one of the best rock bands in history (if not THE best)? If you're tired of pop rock that tries too hard to be edgy and ends up recycling the same old sounds, Wolf Mother will be a breath of fresh air in your ears. They are just the right blend of dazzling classic rock influence and tight, modern sound. Buy this album and if you like great music, then I promise you will not forget it.
0784011680|5.0|This is far from a perfect movie, but it's still a very good movie and interesting for a number of reasons.    On the down side, I think it probably presents a very biased view of Chaplin, at the expenses of many of his contemporaries (Mabel Normand in particular).  It would have been a much better movie had it been less eager to excuse the less appealing aspects of Chaplin's personality.      On the up side, Robert Downey, Jr., does a remarkable job of imitating Chaplin's physical comedy, and it's a treat to get a look at the very early days of the movies.  I recommend this (and rate it well) despite its considerable flaws, and I wish more biographies (even fictionalized biographies) were made of early film stars.
B0018AK9RK|1.0|I love Judas Priest, and can't wait to see them here in Australia when they tour in September, but, what were they thinking when they made this double cd? I popped the disc into my cd player with great anticipation. the first song started, and I had thought there must have been a mix up at the distributers, by them putting the wrong disc in with the wrong cover.It was rubbish. The next song was the same.I endured the whole first cd, and it was the same rubbish all the way through.I was hoping the second cd would be more to the REAL Judas Priest style, but it wasn't.I couldn't listen to the whole second disc.It was ejected, put back into its jewel case, put on my cd shelf never to be listened to again. I was so dissapointed.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|With their fourth studio album, Coldplay takes us places familar and far away.  As others have said, this is not a rehash of the past three albums.  While that would have been wildly successful and welcome, it would signify that the band had stopped growing and was locked into a formula which ultimately would lead to their demise.  Like The Beatles did with Rubber Soul, Revolver and Sgt. Peppers, Viva la Vida, charts new territory with exotic and traditional undertones coupled with hooks which make the tunes stay in your head. The Lennon/Mc Cartney influence is feathered across the entire set of tracks.    Brian Eno is his usual brilliant self letting the group expand their horizon as only he can.  If you are looking for another X&Y, you will be disappointed but if you open your mind to the art that this group of songs represents, you will experience music like nothing else that has been released in some time.  Enjoy and relish art pop rock at its best.
0786948523|1.0|This edition of Dungeons and Dragons has been \\"simplified\\" to where it's basically nothing more than a slightly expanded version of the D&D Miniatures game.     The new rules are focused ONLY on running boardgame-style combat with miniature figures. After running three of four test sessions my players became VERY bored and insisted on going back and playing \\"real D&D.\\"     If you want to play this kind of tabletop miniatures combat, you'd be better of just getting the D&D miniatures game. Or the game \\"Heroscape.\\"     But if you REALLY want to play 4E, I suggest that you wait a month or two. The books will cost a lot less when they're on clearance.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|Overall, this album has been extrodinary! Expecially the new songs stand out veru well, and I don't quite get why it is The Killers least bought Album. i think This, for sure, is the Kilelrs least-rock album, with more of a poppy, synth style for them.    Track List:    1. Tranquilize  This song is very different from the Killers normal songs. First of all, it features the songwriter/singer Loue Reed. It is very strange, almost as if they are talking. It is a great song, overall. All there voices blended together makes a beautiful sound. Another weird thing about this song, is that at the end of the first chorus, Children sing around four lines of words. This song is great, It won an Award for \\"Best Song\\" in NME 2008.    2. Shadowplay  This song sounds very 80's pop with the drums, which makes it interesting for The Killers to play. They did a cover of Joy Division's Shadowplay. In my opinion, The Killers made it at least 10 times better! It sounds so much more upbeat and rock! The guitar really makes the song in the third verse, when there are three different parts running through eachother, that really makes the song to me. The Singers voice sounds strange, as if it was dulled down, to seem creepier or something, but it just makes the song better! I love this song, and think it's one of the best songs on the album. But then again, i think at least 7 of them are the best on the album.    3. All The Pretty Faces  This song is so exciting! I think this is one of the best on the albums to! First there is soft synth, then the guitar plays slowly, to begin the song, then the drums come in, and everything is perfect by the time Brandon starts singing \\"Help me out, I need it!\\" over and over. I think the song is truelly PERFECT until the chorus comes along, and in my opion, ruins pretty much the whole song. The chorus isn't strong at all, I really don't like it, it doesn't match with the rest of the song. But then when it's over, it conects again by saying \\"I don't feel like, I don't feel like, I Don't feel like loving you.\\" and it all fits together again. This song is AMAZING, except for the chorus! :)    4. Leave The Bourbon on The Shelf  As if right now, this song is my favorite song. In the beginning it sounds like your in the garage actually listening to the band, which is awesome, and then the guitar starts and the song sounds  oddly familiar. Ten when Brandon starts singing, his voice is muffled or radio-ized or something, and it's amazing. Then when he gets to the chorus, his voice gets a little less muffled, and then another time it goes completely normal. The song is so great, and it's so upbeat, and garagey. This song is really good for when you need comforting. This song always cheers me up! at the very end, everything is stopped except his voice, which makes it fel like your at a concert    5. Sweet Talk  This is, I think, still my altime favorite song on this album. It's by far the most poppy song of ALL THEIR SONGS. it has synth through about the entire song, and BRandon sings very highly, and he does it with no struggles like the way his voice sounded in Sam's Town, which I thought, put a character in him, and made all the songs better. THe lyrics in this song are VERY goos. the first fourt lines  \\"Lift me up on my honor,  take me over this spell  Get this weight off my shoulders,  I've carried it well\\"  This song is the best. I was my favorite song for almost a month which is a REALLY long time for me. :) It sounds nothing like the killers to me, almost like a different band. But I love it sooooooo much    6. Under THe Gun  Another AWESOME SONG! I beleive this song was released before on Hot Fuss's Limited edition, along with Glamorous Indie rock and roll. This song does sound just like Hot Fuss style, if you liked that. The song just basically reminds me of all the other songs on Hot Fuss, but defenitly the ones up there with Mr. Brightside & All These Things That I've Done.     7. Where The White Boys Dance  This is NOT one of my favorites. The song is strange check out the first few lyrics  \\"Take me to the place where the white boys dance  Take me to the place where they run and play  my baby is gone  you might have a chance  just take me to the place where the white boys dance\\"  I admit, other then the chorus, this song could be good. But the played it really low on the chorus, which screwed the whole thing up. Not the WORST song on sawdust, but one of them. -    8. Show You How  This song is great! The beginning is like a girl checking her messeges on her cell phone, and then the lead vocolist, Brandon Flowers leaves her a messege, singing, then all of a sudden the messed up phone style music, changes to reality. nd he says \\"She told me sweet thing....\\" and goes on talking about the girl he left the messege too. I think this song is very unique and personally I Love it. Although, it's a bit short. 2:28    9. Move Away  This song was featured on spider Man 3. THe guitar style reminds me of Barracuda By Heart, whenver i hear it. This song reminds me of Sam's Town. It's pretty good, it's on my medium side of good n' bad. I don't ahve much to say about this song, there just isn't much to say.     10. Glamorous Ibdie Rock And Roll  The lyrics suck, I'll tell you that. But the song, like the last one, move away, is on my medium side. It's pretty boring with the chorus holding long notes, and then waiting like the same amount of time as the note, with all quiet, and then it's starts again. This song is good, but not on the GREAT side. It gets pretty good when the enter the third verse though.    11.Who Let You Go?  This song is very repetetive. the chorus is just Who Let You go? a million times, so this is on my medium side again. I just wanted to let you know, Where the white boys dance is lower then medium. This song is strangely familiar, it makes you think you've heard it before, when you really haven't. I think a LOT of songs sound like this.    12. The Ballad of Michael Valentine  THis is one of my favorites on the album. I'm suprised it's not popular, because I love it. THere is a little intro  that is very kewwlystrange. Then when it changes to the verse, it gets even better. It's about traveling, but he s telling a story of Michael Valentine, as he mentions is the beginning. This song is real edgy. In the chorus he states I've got The BUZZ, like Marlon Brando. When he says Buzz, it almost sounds like he is high or something, because it's a little strange and whackey. lol. It's true it's very different, maybe he wants it to be his new style of singing or something    13. Ruby, Don't Take Yourr Love To Town  This song, i'm sad to say, is in my opinion the worst killer song of all. It is farm/western/hillbilly style, which frustrates me. They redid this song, so it's boring. The song is dull and boring and if you hate the killers,you would probably be laughing over this song. It's not HORRIBLE, but i think it is yet the worst ever song by the killers, and it is a dissapointment.    14.Daddy's Eyes  This song is very rockish. Lots of guitar, and again it sounds familiar. This song for me is in between medium and good. It was written for his newborn son, Ammon Richard Flowers, born July 14, 2007. He also talks about his wife in the song. This song is a classic, it's pretty good to listen  to.    15. Sam's Town (Abbey Road Version)  This song is from the album Sam's Town, if you've heard it. If you thought that song was too loud, or crazy for you, you will loooove this version.It's all in piano, which makes it much more peaceful. I perfer the regular version of sam's town, but i still love this song!    16. Romeo & Juliet  If you liked the last song, you will probably like this song as well. It's quiet but, beautiful. I love this song, one of the best on sawdust, to me. The old version by the Dire Straits is wonderful too.    17. Mr. Brightside (Remix)  This is perferably annoying to me, because the intro is 2 minutes long, and everything is so slow, but at the end, there is a song called \\"The Captain\\" hidden, which is great!    This album is amazing! My favorite by the killers, ?I? wonder why no-one will give this album a chance!?!?!?! YOU SHOULD!!
1401307450|3.0|Anthony Kiedis.  Red Hot Chili Peppers.   It was interesting to read Anthony's autobiography and understand the meaning beyond some of the lyrics he has written so far.  I do need to separate book from \\"facts\\" however.    The book: 465 pages in tiny print describing a life of excesses in every sense became at times a tedious read, mainly because Anthony's life is self-described and delivered by what I define a rather flat narrative.  A repetition of events -and most often, a vicious circle, literally- that failed to engage me in full in a few parts.  That does not mean that I did not \\"appreciate\\" the content.  If anything, his is an often brutal testimony of what a serious drug addiction can do to a human being (I felt that this book was more about his drug addiction than about his life or the RHCP).      The \\"facts\\": oh, I would have a thing or two to say about his upbringing, I am itching to do it.  But.   Anthony comes out to be so non-judgemental,  so not-critical,  so loving towards his family, which he clearly loves to bits to this day, that I am discouraged to say anything more about it.  And I respect him for not pointing any accusing finger, about back then or later on.  He is not blaming anyone, or at least, that's the way I have perceived the core of this book.  In his words, it was mostly all about \\"the shortcut\\", which brought him to jump fences instead of walking on a proper path, figuratively and literally.  The drugs, his love stories, his songs, the band, the friends he has lost to drugs, the rehabs, and drugs again...  An indefinable sense of hopelessness, sometimes peppered with sober, more productive moments, where the love towards life shines in full.  I think that it is at this point that he chose to write the book, after a few years of sobriety.  And I hope the process of retracing his past has added to the self-healing and helped to stay clean and sober, appreciating life to the full.      Would Anthony have become what he is without experiencing what he went through?  I do not know.  We are what we do, or so they say. But as much as this book conveys the dispiritedness, desolation and utter despair connected to drug addiction, it is uplifting to see that it is POSSIBLE to get out of it.  Tough, difficult, hard, but possible.  An inspiration for those ones who are still struggling.    I read somewhere that Anthony recently had a baby (last year).  Not an epilogue to his story, but another, wonderful, beginning.
B000YJ54DU|1.0|If you waste your time reading this book you will lose valuable time which could have spent reading a good book.  I made it to the end of this book but it wasn't easy.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|When a band has been around as long as Judas Priest there comes a time when the artists involved want to create something new and interesting.  I know sometimes this approach falls flat, especially with bands that have created a following with a recognizable signature sound.  I believe this record will grow on listeners as this isn't one of those offerings where you pop it in and get instant gratification.  The knee jerk reaction negativity is unfortunate here as we should at least give this double album time to sink in.  I, for one, am intrigued.
B00127RAJY|5.0|you can figure out the rest.  Jillian is known to be tough as nails and extremely demanding on The Biggest Loser and this workout is designed the same way.  I love how much of a sweat you can get going in just a few minutes.  Definitely a great at-home option.
0385338724|5.0|Yes, this book may have been predictable to a certain extent (the ending is, but I do not believe the middle is at all unless you are Sophie K). I must say that in the past I have not enjoyed every single one of her books, but when I read the inside cover of this one I had to buy it that day...at the cover price. I just wanted to read it. I sat down and read it all in one day and it did not disappoint in the slightest. It is witty and keeps you guessing, which is what made me not want to put it down. The characters are well-written and believable. There are sharp, little turns around every corner and it's not something that makes you fall out of your seat screaming, \\"OH MY LORD I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT JUST HAPPENED!\\" but it got a few gasps out of me. I like the way it happened, with the scenes unfolding and I would recommend this book to anyone. I have already passed it around my group of friends, whose book tastes are very, very different and each one of them have gotten something different out of this book. Very highly recommended.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I just finished listening to the album and while it will take a while to fully sink in, here is my take on the album. By the way, it is a truly wonderful album. Powerful and beautiful yet not as immediately accessible as anything they've released before. This is a very mature album from the best band in the world today.      1.Life in Technicolor- Beautiful instrumental opening. Sets the tone for the glorious music that is to ensue. Gorgeous!    2.Cemetaries of London- This is a great, great, song. Interesting beats. Dark tones and mood. Great Buckland guitar. Atmospheric, delightful head candy. One of my favorite coldplay tracks ever and my most favorite off the new alsbum so far.     3.Lost!- Brilliant song. Rich and textured. This version is more funked out with a thick beat. Beautiful.    4.42-What an opening. Gorgeous and reminiscent of old-school Coldplay. The breakdown at 1:35 is wonderful. This is a song that has it all. Guitar and piano. It is ballady and rockin' and lush and glorious.    5.Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love- Better than the acoustic version I must say. Eno production is sparkling here. Faster beat, beautiful vocals, piano, the whole deal. Reign of Love was a soft delicate ballad but I was not blown away. It was good but not great.    6.Yes/Chinese Sleep Chant- Great opening strings. I think this song will grow on me. It is almost bluegrass sounding. I do love Martin's lower register on this track though.   Chinese Sleep Chant I liked more. Great guitar riff which martins vocals glide over. Gauzy, great reverb, great sound.    7.Viva La Vida- great song, we are all aware.    8. Violet Hill- ditto    9. Strawberry Swing- A real sweet treat this one is. Very different. Almost sounds like a country song meets Fleetwood Mac meets Coldplay's majesty. Reminds me of Eno's An Ending(Ascent) in chord structure. Great chord changes here. Definitely one of the standout songs for me. Chills the whole time. Wow.     Death and All His Friends/The Escapist- Beautiful ballad, one of their best ever, and I love the guitars towards the end. A worthy closing piece though Amsterdam will always be the king of Coldplay album closers. Still this track is gorgeous and the Escapist revisits the wonderful theme of Life in Technicolor while adding the vocals that would have been nice as opener. Granted, this is still a great track.    All in all this album is very solid and a definite 5 stars. Coldplay have progressed and did not go back to the same bag of tricks for this album. Not all fans will be pleased and again, this is an album that demands repeated plays to truly understand its greatness. This album comfortably stands in the ranks of Parachutes and Rush of Blood. I am glad that Coldplay sound as good as ever. We really are lucky to have such inspiring and beautiful music to get us through the long lazy Summer.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|It's easy to say that this band is carried by Hayley Williams and her phenomenal vocals, but if you think that, you've probably only heard the very Panic!, Fall Out Boy influenced \\"Riot!\\", the groups second album.     While Riot! has some obvious highlights and a few songs which are clearly making up the rest of the album, All We Know Is Falling is top notch from the title track starting things off to the brilliant \\"My Heart\\", my personal favourite and often the last track played in their live sets as well as the one to finish this album.    On All We Know Is Falling, Paramore feature as much more than Hayley Williams and band. The songs are better and catchier. This debut comes from a little known band who was making music they liked rather than just trying to make it in the mainstream. Hopefully they go back towards that mentality for the third effort.
B00026WU82|5.0|\\"Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br /> Threw the bums a dime in your prime<br /> DIDN'T YOU?\\"<br /><br />And so begins one of the greatest songs (albums) in rock music history. As Bob Dylan chronicles the downward spiral of an unidentified smug soul's fall from grace, he wisely places himself in the background as an innocent observer with lower status. While he obviously takes satisfaction in rubbing salt in the wounds of this person, it was arrogant recklessness and blind self righteousness that brought this one down, not Dylan's treachery.<br /><br />...Aah, the beauty of poetic justice.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00026WU82 Highway 61 Revisited]] (1965) was Bob Dylan's first legitimate full rock music album, and with Mike Bloomfield playing the guitar and Al Kooper on the keyboards, it's both a satisfying and competent blues/folk-rock venture all the way through. There is really some consistent musicianship here. [[ASIN:B00026WU82 Highway 61 Revisited]] is also where Bob Dylan's name became a household word, and everybody in the music world and beyond started to watch his every move.<br /><br />The songs are angry and imaginitive with a host of surreal characters and interesting places. Dylan uses these characters to enigmatically expose corruption, apathy and haughtiness. In Tombstone Blues, Dylan rails against, among other things, the emotional clutter of superfluous and misguided distractions.<br /><br />Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain<br />That could hold you dear lady from going insane<br />That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain<br />Of your useless and pointless knowledge<br /><br />The macabre piano blues, The Ballad Of A Thin Man, is a carnival like, demented and very effective depiction of counter-culture shock paranoia.<br /><br />And you say, \\"Oh my God<br />Am I here all alone?\\"<br /><br />Because something is happening here<br />But you don't know what it is<br />...Do you, Mister Jones?<br /><br />Queen Jane Approximately revisits the fall from grace scenario, but with a different, just barely more compassionate, twist. The title song is a surreal blues-rock Biblical story/folk ballad/madcap fairy tale, complete with slide guitar and a toy siren. Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues is a humorous, yet cynical, ballad of several different circumstances encountered in Juarez at Eastertime.<br /><br />The eleven minute-plus Spanish folk ballad epic, Desolation Row, closes the album and features a cast of characters that includes Cindarella, Romeo, Cain and Abel, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the Good Samaritan, Ezra Pound, T.S.

1400049628|5.0|The Zombie survival guide: Complete protection from the Living Dead is a must for any person who is worried about zombie survival. Giving chapters and break downs of outbreaks, how to fortify your environment, and how to better protect yourself from the invading horde, this very essential book is a must for your bug out bag. Don't find yourself in an invasion without it!     The actual review:    I really enjoyed this book. Zombies had always fascinated me, so to find a book that treated them like a real and true voice in the world just made me giggle. I read the book on a long car ride from Florida, and it kept me amused basically the whole time. It's set up like a real survival book, so the humor may be lost on a few. It's definitely a fun one to include on your book shelf or to keep in your car. Great conversation piece. Max Brooks has really out done himself with writing a detailed guide about how to stay away from an oncoming horde of the undead. Great book to have!
B0001K9IJ8|4.0|\\"The Girl in the Other Room,\\" (2004) by Canadian born jazz singer/pianist Diana Krall, represents a departure and new beginning for her: she leaves behind the Great American Songbook, to work with more modern, personal material, covering songs by Tom Waits, Mose Allison, and Joni Mitchell, in addition to writing several more with her husband, the outstanding  British singer/musician Elvis Costello.  Furthermore, this CD comes to us as an enhanced SACD: it'll give you wonderful sound if you've the equipment for it.<br /><br />Krall, who was awarded a scholarship to Boston's prestigious Berklee College of Music, won the 2002 Best Jazz Vocalist Grammy for \\"Live in Paris.\\" Overheard elevator conversations seem to indicate that that record's been most popular among her listeners; it swings more. However, as Krall has continued to work with her long-time producer, Tommy LiPuma, (she gets a co producer credit with him on this album), some of \\"The Girl,\\" can be found to swing equally well. Other tracks give us glimpses of emotional depths that, reserved Canadian that the singer undoubtedly is, she hasn't chosen to reveal to us until now.  Guess we should thank Mr. Costello, possibly the littlest Costellos, for that.<br /><br />On much of the disk, Krall is backed by her long-term collaborators in rhythm, Jeff Hamilton on drums and bassist John Clayton.  She gets further support from drummer Peter Erskine, bassist John Christian McBride; and guitarist Anthony Wilson. Drummer Terri Lynne Carrington and Neil Larson also sit in on Hammond B-3 for one cut.  \\"The thing about Diana is her musicianship,\\" Al Schmitt recently told the Los Angeles Times.  \\"More than most singers, she knows what's right for her, and she knows how to make it happen musically.\\" Just listen to two collaborations with Costello, the title track and \\"Departure Bay.\\" Or a Bonnie Raitt favorite, \\"Love Me Like a Man,\\" written by folk/bluesman Chris Smither, and note the Duke Ellington salute in its final chorus.<br /><br />This girl is cooking with gas these days.s cooking with gas these days.
0765357151|5.0|I had seen the recent movie adaption to this book and I must say, I love both just the way they are. The book made the movie a lot clearer in ways for me, actually trying to put science behind exactly what the monsters were. This book is extremely well written for the time it came from, and the imagination is boundless. I love monster stories and this one is not one to pass up!<br />This book, however, comes with more than just I Am Legend. It also comes with assorted stories from Richard Matheson. Although his other stories aren't quite as long as I Am Legend, they follow a similar style and are definitely worth reading once you're done with the book itself. All in all this is an extremely great buy. I love it.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Coldplay has turned in another solid effort with its 4th studio album, the indecisively-titled \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends,\\" but they expand their boundaries this time. Gone is the predictability of tightly-wound, highly catchy 4 minute arena pop/rock anthems marching in succession, not to mention the sensitive male singer/songwriter clich&eacute;s and often dial-by-numbers production values. The British quartet has traded that solid but stagnant formula for artsy experimentation, and the results are commendable, even if their enlisting legendary studio wizard Brian Eno to bolster the LP's ethereal, left-field sound is in and of itself predictable. These songs do not lend themselves to radio playlists in the vein of \\"Clocks\\" or \\"Talk,\\" but the album is their most intriguing and memorable. The results are a little less Phil Collins, a little more Peter Gabriel.<br /><br />The highly digitized, nearly instrumental \\"Life In Technicolor\\" opens the album on a high note with sweeping Middle-Eastern instrumentation and loopy, buoyant beats. Immediately ascertainable is that this is not an album that can safely grace the intercom of the local ShopRite. With hand claps and frothy production values behind a droning, funereal organ, \\"Lost!\\" is a poignant, yearning ode to finding salvation and a new lease on life. Accented by just the right amount of electric guitar, the intriguing, atypical track not only rocks and invigorates but finds these talented musicians trying for something new and succeeding, underscoring the album's unexpectedly adventurous direction.<br /><br />With its soul-searching sentiments and sizzling melody, chugging lead single \\"Viva La Vida\\" is the only track that oozes mainstream appeal with its sweeping, gorgeously evocative melody that has landed it at #1 on the Billboard pop charts. In that light, it is classic Coldplay and, amazingly, their first Top 5 hit. Even alternate lead single \\"Violet Hill,\\" a Top 40 hit, defies radio programmers with its mercurial tempo and deep, adventurous lyrics. Singer Chris Martin, however, has never sounded more confident in his delivery, and the band's playing skills have never been demonstrated so impressively in-studio. These four guys sound truly in-sync, and rather than burying their sound Eno smartly accentuates it, bringing out the essence of the songs.<br /><br />The plaintive \\"42\\" is another awesome outing. After 90 seconds of mellow piano and dark lyrics the song zooms into a succession of production swirls, fast melody swings and snazzy electric guitars. It is not only a marvel, but worth many listens. \\"Lovers In Japan\\" is also a winner with its sunny, bristly melody - the way Martin wraps his vocals around the proceedings is a pleasure to hear. The thunderous ode to peace that is \\"Death and All His Friends\\" is also a highlight as it closes the album before revealing a hidden track titled \\"The Escapist,\\" a mellow finale set to the tune of \\"Life In Technicolor.\\"<br /><br />The men of Coldplay will likely lose fans who prize clear-cut ear candy over adventurousness, yet will surely gain respect from those who had previously written them off as creators of slick but predictable radio-savvy pop/rock.

B0018S6YOE|4.0|The folks behind the scenes of pop/R&B singer Rihanna's marvelous career are truly doing a spectacular job. The sweet-voiced 20 year-old from Barbados has a  listenable but limited vocal talent, yet in less than three years she has amassed a string of hit singles to her name, each one more memorable than the last. Solid songwriters churning out solid radio-ready compositions as well as her image - sexy yet classy, thoroughly everywoman - have turned Rihanna into a world-conquering superstar. \\"Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded\\" continues that success by giving a facelift to her 3rd studio album which debuted at #2 on the Billboard albums chart last year and easily outsold her first two LPs due to international smash \\"Umbrella,\\" an endlessly listenable, steamily sexy summer scorcher courtesy of songwriting marvel The-Dream, as well as catchy, uptempo follow-up hits \\"Shut Up and Drive\\" and \\"Don't Stop the Music.\\" \\"Hate That I Love You,\\" an emotional duet with R&B singer/songwriter dynamo Ne-Yo, has also gained deserved praise, peaking at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100.<br /><br />Never before has Rihanna landed a tremendous, instant smash in the form of a ballad, but thanks to \\"Take a Bow\\" she has added that feat to her list of accomplishments. With its classic he-done-me-wrong style, the song is instantly relatable to women of all ages. With a simple backing track of poignant piano and rhythmic handclaps, the stark composition lets Rihanna's vocals guide the way and the results are surprisingly impressive.

B0013FXWU6|3.0|Kind of hard to keep up. To many look alike. Shows that a rich man isn't rich from money of deception.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|First I will tell you where I am coming from as far as a Judas Priest fan. I started back with Stained Glass on vinyl along with Unleashed in the East. These were my first forays into the Priest. I had followed them until the Ripper years and then lost touch. I do love the Halford Insurrection album also. That being said, I really enjoyed this album. I think for me it is closer to 4.5 at first listen. Unlike other reviews I have read, I believe the keyboards and orchestration bring an atmospheric connection to Nostradomus. The gothic feel of the Middle Age period and the \\"Black Death\\"  in which this man lived comes through. Isn't that what this piece of music is supposed to transmit? The first blip came with Lost Love for me. It is an acoustic piece and I liked the  other acoustic interludes on this disc. I just wish that tracks like The Four Horseman, Shadows in the Flame and Calm before the Storm would have been better developed accoustically. I enjoyed all of those. The second problem came with two songs for me with Hope and New Beginnings. I didn't really like either one with Hope being the worst of the two for me. I thought it ended strongly with Nostradums and Future of Mankind. If you liked what you heard of the single Nostradamus I think you will like what you hear. Honestly, I think there are much stronger tracks on here then the title cut. Now I will tell you I sat down and listened to this straight through with no breaks and a few relaxing beverages. I usually don't like everything in a first listen, but I liked all of this but 3 songs. I will go back and listen to them again today. Only 3 first time clunkers out of 23 isn't bad. Certainly this was experimental by Priest's own words and I am glad for the branching out for them. They have earned the right and they have done it well I believe. If your waiting for an album of bone crunching you won't get it here. If your looking for a fine conceptual piece about a Middle Ages sage.....I think you will enjoythis.

B000009HF2|5.0|I recently purchased Frampton Comes Alive cd and it still sounds as good as the day it was released.The music from this era is timless!!!!
B00005JKG9|5.0|This is a true classic. Acting at it's best. Need to watch it more than once to fully appreciate it. I know some people may say after watching it the first time, it is boring but after viewing the second and third time all the nuances are revealed. The interplay between Pacino, Harris, Spacey, Lemmon, Arkin, Baldwin, Pryce......all superb. Even the supporting cast is top notch. Check out Jude Ciccolella (24) as the cop. If you thought you were in a rat-race, just look at these guys. Be warned a lot of profanity, including the dread C-word, but doesn't use it for shock value, just to illustrate what these guys go through in the pressure cooker environment. Mamet's screenplay is excellent..only difference between the film and play is Baldwin's character, which in my opinion is the best acting he's ever done. Buy it now. I just wish they will release it on Blu-Ray.
B0018OAPAW|3.0|There are a few things that I feel need to be said about this album that the previous reviews have not touched upon.<br /><br />First of all, I don't know if it's the excitement of a new release from these guys or what but this album DOES NOT sound like \\"Smash\\" or \\"Ixnay on the Hombre.\\" In fact, the band has not sounded like that in a long time. Do not get me wrong, I think that growth and change are common and should be tolerated when it comes to music, but don't tell people this album sounds like these two excellent releases. Ever since \\"Americana\\" The Offspring has sounded more polished and radio-friendly and there is no denying that, so why are we denying it?<br /><br />Second of all, this release, with the exception of a few songs sounds very sloppy and unfocused. It sounds like The Offspring is trying to make an album of sure-to-be hit singles. The album left me fatigued and unfulfilled BUT each song individually sounded fine. To put them all on one album, I think, was a mistake.<br /><br />Third of all, WHO MIXED THIS ALBUM?!?! They should be ashamed of themselves. The muddy delivery that this album has should never be tolerated. Who decided that this mix was acceptable? It's disgusting.<br /><br />My final point about this album and the last (Splinter) is that The Offspring hasn't listed a drummer. Perhaps you reading this can help me. I know the band used a drum machine for their last album and had a guy on hold for live shows. Are they doing this again? If so, That is quite lazy and lends to the idea that The Offspring are only doing this for the $$$.<br /><br />This album, although horribly mixed, had some high points. These include:<br /><br />Hammerhead<br />Takes me Nowhere<br />Nothingtown<br />Rise and Fall<br /><br />The rest I can do without but these songs, even with the mud, are fantastic!
B0014XCMVM|1.0|Seriously, I can't even listen to this on my PC! Which, in turn, means I can't upload it onto my iPod. Too bad for me, because I just wasted my money for something I'll never listen to.

Truly a great book, very high signal:noise ration, very hgih quality, well worth taking the time to read.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|I love this CD.  My favorite song is probably Warwick Avenue.  What first hooked me to her music was hearing her \\"Mercy\\" single but after hearing the whole album that song has to be my least favorite. Duffy's music is very heartfelt.

B000Y35A94|5.0|Hi All,    The When in Rome DVD is a piece of great work and i think the classic song In the Cage and also the meddley are terrific. Phil Collins playing great drums on this meddley, specially on Duke´s Travel; Tony Banks and his long keyboards solo; and Mike Rutherford playing a superd bass (yeah, this is a good chance to see Mike as a fantastic bass player); Daryl and Chester are perfect as usual. The production is wonderful. No doubt! Go for it! Oh, I forgot, you also get a briliant Ripples; the instrumental Los Endos with the drum duet; the classic hit I Know What I Like (like the old times) and of course all the hit songs from the 80´s. I think When in Rome represents their greatest live action.
0312330537|5.0|This is an amazing book.  Gregory Roberts speaks to the humanity in all of us with his exquisite writing.  He honors us with a depth of wisdom about the intricacies of relationships. He reveals his knowledge through stories of love, loss, friendship, betrayal and patriotism. I laughed.  I cried. His characters were in my head long after I finished reading his deeply meaningful book. I am recommending it to social workers, counselors, educators, psychologists and anyone in the health professions. We find ourselves in his words.  I emailed Oprah and told her to put this book on her list and to hurry. It is a must read. Instead of flowers, I am now giving this book as my gift. Gregory's beautiful words linger with grace.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|3.5 Stars. I just want to to say to those who are giving this album one star is that you aren't listening to it enough. When I first heard the album I hated it. But I also can't agree with the rosy 5 star reviews that call this their best album yet. And that won't change over time either. Coldplay made this album in part because of some macho complex that kept telling them they are a girly band, Martin has a girly voice, and their music isn't all that serious. In other words, they made this album for critics. And the critics, to no surprise, love it.     I have liked every album Coldplay has put out and I will say that I don't think they have really made an atrocious song yet. That streak has come to an end. As I mentioned, I listened to this album straight through the first time and I did not care for it all. But being a fan and listening to other positive fan reviews I decided to keep listening. After this exercise, I have to say there are a few good songs on here, but this is not the complete album that Coldplay's previous efforts have produced. On those other albums I may occasionally skip one song. On this album, I find myself only listening frequently to a few. Here are my thoughts:    I want to say that I really like the first part of the album. Cemeteries of London is a good song. It has a great pace and catchy chorus in the refrain. I also absolutely love 42. It's probably the most familiar song Coldplay fans will find on this record. As for Lost! and Lovers in Japan, I like them, but I love! love! love! their acoustic versions better. It is kind of ironic that these acoustic versions sound much more like Coldplay than the regular tracks. With Lost!, perhaps it is that the piano, which I absolutely adore, lets this track shine and the lyrics and Martin's voice shine through. I don't think I have ever patently preferred an acoustic version of a song over the original until now. As for Lovers In Japan, I like both versions, but again, the acoustic brings outthe lyrics better than the original.    The next part of the album is what I would call more experimental. Reign of Love is okay, but it lacks something that I can't quite pinpoint yet. Yes is very much experimental... sort of like A Whisper. What I don't like is Martin trying to change his voice. It sounds brooding and dark. I hate Chinese Sleep Chant.    Viva la Vida is one of the two singles getting air time. It is a great song. I think if it was placed earlier in the album it would probably play better. My head is still ringing from Chinese sleep chant. I think it could also use some piano. More Piano! More Cowbell!    Violet Hill, the main single, is okay. But again it feels out of place on the album. It also sounds like an 80's song I can't quite place. I think another reviewer referenced this. I like the song... but it just doesn't really sound like a Coldplay song.    Strawberry Swing... the concept and jingle is interesting, but is very poorly executed. Martin sounds like he is mumbling like a later Eddie Vedder. I also think it could use a more robust guitar. Something more akin to the guitar work in Green Eyes. It's a song worth listening to once to sample the band's experimentation, but I can easily see my self forgetting this song over time.     Death and all his friends... okay ending song. But again, you are kind of already asleep from Strawberry Swing to really get the effect of the intro. I would take it or leave it.    I get the sense that this album will most likely sound better live without all the extra layers of production Brian Eno felt the need to saddle this album with. The guy who produced Arcade Fire also worked on this album and it shows.  I don't much care for Arcade Fire because while their music is interesting, it's also so layered and textured that it almost becomes an exercise in itself to listen to it. Many songs on this album require that similar exercise. I am glad Coldplay decided to break the mold a bit, even though I really liked X&Y. But I think they could have been experimental without abandoning their sound on much of the album. It seems almost like an imposter band is playing the music on some of this album because they were trying to make their sound more macho. I think they failed in this respect and also failed in staying true to their sound. The song Yes is the epitome of this effort. Coldplay needs to stop listening to producers and critics that are telling them to go this direction. It ignores the millions of fans that fell in love with their first three albums.     On a final note, I can't recommend to you enough to get the acoustic versions of Lost! and Lovers in Japan.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|There are so many reviews here, and I am sure everyone will say something that might spoil it for the many who have not yet seen every episode. So my review will refrain from details.       I stumbled onto watching Dexter on a regular tv channel recently. It was originally a Showtime series that was being promoted to lead viewers to the new upcoming season 3, which premiers September 2008. I immediately became very interested in this show. When it ended and said that season 3 would be coming on Showtime in September I immediately ordered Showtime so as not to miss it. I purchased the full season 1 to watch the complete series in exact order. I have watched each episode several times and found myself laughing again and again. I even picked up on missed clues that I would not have seen coming until the season was over. As I watched for the second time, third time, and even sat and watched it again with others, I still tend to pick up on stuff.       This is one heck of a good, \\"bloody fun\\" series, to keep you tuned in. It's not scary like in those stupid horror flicks, with scares that jump out at you. It is very neatly and thoughtfully written, with great characters, storylines, subplots, that keep you wanting more. Interestingly, I found that somehow I was rooting for Dexter. I thought, how can that be? I was raised with religious faith, morals, a conscience. But I feel for Dexter. He is very bright, and would be the last person I would ever suspect to be a \\"monster.\\" I try to understand what a 2 or 3 year old boy can feel, or even remember. I try not to judge why he is who he is. I even wonder how many people watching, have a day of road rage, or work stress, or see a crime on the street, and would not think for just a second about doing something about it. Most people would go about their business. I am sure that most \\"normal\\" people have these thoughts. But only the Dexters in our world cross over where most of us won't go. So in a morbid sense, I thank Dexterfor not being so normal and doing it for me, for us. Thanks Dexter! lol.       When the show is over I find myself thinking about morals, good conduct, and wonder as I look at people around me, 'is that person sane?' 'Could this person have a dark side, skeletons in their closet?' 'IS that the face of a criminal hiding something?' This is why Dexter is head and shoulders above regular shows. It is well worth owning. I just bought season 2 and will be looking out the window awaiting more Dexter. It is so easy to get hooked. I can't wait for September to see if any of my questions will be answered. See you there!
0140157352|5.0|This book changed the study and practice of negotiation since it was first published.    It is one of the most important books on negotiation ever written.    It is based on \\"interest based\\" negotiation and \\"expanding the pie\\" and then \\"dividing it\\".  It is about cooperative negotiation and how this should be the default rule whenever possible.    It is excellent and a must read for any student of negotiation.
B000ZK4466|3.0|Mars Volta is challenging their listeners' tolerance to the limit.  While Amputechture featured very long songs of chaotic fusion, this album features great drums that overtop it.  This musical stew does not have the resting point that Viscera Eyes provided.  There are a few footholds such as Aberinkula with it's catchy lyric, \\"plans that forgot me 99 times,\\" keeping the rhythm.  The lines in Ilyena, \\"I need... a brand new skin,\\" are supported by a coiling guitar riff.  Cavalettas should be a solid song for their live shows, similar to the epic performances on the live Scabdates album.  All of these songs have something in common:  the vocals are authentic.  They don't suffer the Mickey Mouse falsetto abuse present on Metatron, Wax Simulacra, Askepios and Agadez.  The second half of Agadez comes back around to Mars Volta's notorious latin sound, but it is not particularly memorable.  Goliath is an overworked version of \\"Rapidfire Tollbooth\\" from Omar's \\"Bufalo de la Noche\\" solo album (which is much heavier and grounded).  Tourniquet Man is a transitional type of song that goes on for 2 and a half minutes.  Later on the album, Ouroborous tells a story while the music languishes.  Similarly Soothsayer is very repetitive and aimless.  I am most likely to stop listening to the album at this point.    This is my least favorite Mars Volta album.  It's not particularly bad.  It's worth owning, compared with the Emo band of the day, but overall it feels like the songs could have used more critical revisions and a little restraint on the vocals.  There will always be a tendency for fans to contrast their new releases against Francis the Mute or Comatorium; the Mars Volta are their own competition.  It's a treadmill of criticism, but I still think that they will release another album that is different but equal to them.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|After the incredible Rush of Blood to the Head, Coldplay made the commercially and critically acclaimed X & Y. To be honest, I really didn't like that album. The band had broken into the pop music industry (and by pop, I mean popular music), made a dent, and then played in safe with an album of predictable and boring \\"anthems.\\" I was hoping for more from a group that had proved themselves creativly. But now, I believe they have redeemed themselves by releasing a more ambitious and intriguing album. Viva la Vida, produced by the masterfull Brian Eno, adds to the old Coldplay sound with non-tradidtional procussion (handclaps, complex rhythmic patterns) pulsing throughout and driving the songs onto unsafe grounds. The guitars also take a more atmospheric turn, sliding in the background with beautiful melodies or just adding a layer of harmony. Since Eno is the producer, there are also added keyboards and sound effects that swirl into the mix at just the right moments.   The songs themselves are on par with Coldplay's best. They are catchy, sweet, affecting, beautiful, and with a hint of the danger that was missing from X & Y. The interesting thing was the decision to combine a few of the songs: Lovers in Japan-Reign of Love is two different songs pulled together, Yes is split into two parts, and Death and All his Friends has an outro. So although the tracklisting says 10 songs, it's more like 13, which I consider a good thing.   Ultimatly, I think this album had vision, and I hope that negative reviews don't stop Coldplay from traveling further outside their comfort zone.
B0002CYPVQ|4.0|My 3 year old got this for Christmas and is thrilled.  He does not tear up his toys (and gets frustrated when playmates do) and this has held up well.  He has 6 Bruder Caterpillar machines and they are all detailed and realistic.  The tracks have come off his excavator twice and I taught him how to avoid it.  The tracks are MUCH better than the rubber-band style tracks on el-cheapo toys.  This is a totally cool construction vehicle and even my 3 year old knows it.  I would have given this a 5 star rating, but there are a few things that aren't quite perfect...  One is that it's really large and a bit of a challenge for a 3-year old to man-handle.  Another is that while the arm and the bucket move as a coordinated unit (curling/uncurling together) they are a little challenging for his strength level (40# at 3 years - he's no wimp).  The other thing is that the swivel of the cab on the chassis has a detent in the straight-forward position that's a bit difficult to overcome.  He just spins it on the tracks, not on the pivot, and that doesn't bother him.  By 5 years old, he'll be doing everything with it.<br /><br />Bottom line: 1) It's cool  2) It's durable 3) It works like a real excavator, and 4) It's not going to break unless he falls on it - and it will break him at the same time.<br /><br />Buy-on Caterpillar fans!
B0014XCMVM|4.0|I have not purchased an Alanis Morissette album since Jagged Little Pill.  I would have to say that ever since the single 'Thank U' was released, kind of was turned off to any of her music.  After listening to Flavors Of Entanglement, I am pleased and again interested in Alanis Morissette.  In the past, many of Alanis's songs would allow my mind to wonder off in fantasy as I listened to her music.  Several songs off 'Flavors' gave me the same satisfaction.   I'm very glad that I gave the album a chance and recommend it to the music fan that likes to listen to music as their imagination goes free.  Notable tracks in my opinion are \\"Underneath, Giggling Again For No Reason, Straitjacket.\\"
B009SH5JS4|5.0|One of my favorite movies for the cinematography done in France, the sarcastic banter between the characters, and Kevin Kline's rendition of &#34;La Mer&#34; at the end.

0553277472|5.0|Although this book requires a bit of reflection (so is therefore not a fast read) it provides a great explanation of ZEN philosophy - the key points summarized are:  Western Philosophy = What is right vs wrong,  Easter Philosophy = what is best.  Also, the author explores at length the concept of \\"quality\\" and the idea that things that are good (that is, of high quality) originate from within, and is not something that can be \\"taught\\".  When something is good (music, book, art) the consumer (listener, reader, perceiver) simply knows that it is good (that of high quality).  I know this sounds overly simple, but when explored at length these concepts can change the way you perceive everything.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|My experience with this movie is people really enjoy it, or they think it is stupid.  This is an excellent introduction to \\"art cinema\\" for young people, and a movie that parents can enjoy with their children.  It's fun and thoroughly entertaining.  Although suitable for \\"kids\\" this is an \\"adult\\" movie for those who are able to appreciate the cleverness of the entire production.
0756404746|5.0|This book is one of the best I have read this year, and I would say, one of the better I have read in years.  An amazing introduction to compelling, real, enjoyable characters.

0385338724|3.0|Sophie Kinsella does a great job with new characters and a different plot. I'm a fan of the Shop-a-holic series, and while all the books can't be like Becky Bloomwood, this was quick, fun, and certainly entertaining. While somewhat predictable - the purpose of reading these books isn't for a big twist at the end. Just a nice way to pass some time and enjoy some laugh out loud moments with the characters Kinsella creates.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|A great blend of the Coldplay we've come to love with new style and direction. The album manages to sound familiar and brand new at the same time. The lead single(s) set the mood for an album that is solid from beginning to end.
B00003W8NM|3.0|Fight Club is just one of the film's you have to see to believe. I pretty much saw the twist the whole way through but Edward Norton and Brad Pitt keep this movie from sinking into a pool of blood. The premise of the film is pretty simple, no one talks about Fight club etc. This film just seems too out there and never fully exciting. The violence is somewhat brutual but hey Pitt's body is nice to look at. Good movie but not a masterpiece.
B000Q66PXE|1.0|I could only make it about six or seven episodes into this new series when it first aired. I had high expectations because of HBO's hype, after all, they canceled another really great series (Carnivale) so that they could keep this stinker on the air.    Here's where they went wrong with Rome. An executive at HBO said, \\"The Sopranos is a great show, what makes it a great show?\\" The answer of course is irresistible characters and an intriguing storyline, but being the masters of insight into film making that television executives often aren't, they decided the answer was, \\"violence, sex and curse words,\\" as if the audience is a bunch of thirteen year olds. And the show really offers little more than just that, violence, sex and curse words, and nothing in the way of a three dimensional character or an interesting plot. Just for some added spice, all of the Romans speak their English with a British accent, giving the whole thing a cheesiness level rivaled by Geico commercials.    Give it a try if you like, but when you get to the \\"battle scene\\" in the first season that they've been building up to for the first six or seven episodes, I can guarantee disappointment.

There are plenty of reviews here to go around so I'll make this short except to say there is some thievery going on (other reviewers have already noted, it's Beethoven on Great Expectations, a touch of Border Song (Elton John) on Beth, and there could be more), and listen to the intro before Detroit Rock City on headphones sometime.  The engineer, Corky Stasiak (sp?), recorded it and the car you hear revving up is a Toyota! (a Celica I believe)  I give this record 5 stars but it is my least played of any of the first 6 studio albums.  I've heard it too many times and can't objectively listen to God of Thunder, Great Expectations, Beth or Shout it out Loud anymore.
0060555661|4.0|I have been reading the intelligent investor for a couple of days now and just finished chapter 4. The book can seem a bit long but it is not. The arguments are easy to understand and comprehend. Graham argues that investment, as great as it could be, also contains significant risks and for long periods of times have not outperformed bonds when considering inflation. He thinks every intelligent person should have no more that 75% in equities in best of times and should have up to 75% in bonds in bad times. It is definitely a book worth reading not only because he reaches sensible conclusions and warns you not to blindly follow pundits but simply because it gives you overview on market performance by analyzing the historical data that should be mandatory knowledge for everyone serious about investing.
0618918248|1.0|Dawkins attacks God and religion like a bull terrier.Fortunately in this case his attack is not fatal.The only God he seems to know is the angry punitive God of patriarchy and fundamentalism.The same goes for his concept of religion.He has nothing new to say on the god of patriarchy, who has already been better disposed of by the likes of Mary Daly and M. Sjoo.The God of love and forgiveness is alien to Dawkins. He mainly relies on reason to \\"disprove\\" God.However reason has its limitations, it can't give all the answers to life, a fact not considered by Dawkins.Humans are more than thinking reeds, they have other capacities such as feelings, intuition, imagination, soul and spirit. Dawkins does not consider that we have a range of faculties with which to experience the cosmos. His argument against personal experience of God is simplistic in the extreme.He gives some examples where the mind has been deluded. In one case, when he was a boy he heard a weird noise at night in bed. He investigated and found it was the wind whistling through the keyhole.He states the mind is easily deluded, therefore he would not believe anyone who said they had an experience of God.So much for a scientific attitude.In no case does he consider different viewpoints and weigh the evidence.His mind is made up from the start. He says religion is an irrationality that is imposed on children.But he is the one at fault, for he has no conception of a spiritual dimension to human life.He is like a tone deaf person saying music is just noise, abolish it because I can't appreciate it. He thinks there would be less intolerance and violence if religion was abolished. But he does not consider that it is the fault of humans, not religion in the abstract. His knowledge of human nature is lacking. There are usually people around who use religion for political purposes and to repress others.This is a misuse of religion.Dawkins thinks the world would be a better place if all were atheists.However, he avoids the question of atheistical communism in this equation.He states there is no evidence atheism motivated  Joseph Stalin's brutality. Atheists can be bad, so the problem of evil is not solved by atheism.Dawkins has written a one-eyed simplistic book. He is just as intolerant as those he criticises.People in glass houses should not throw stones, as they say. Concerning this book,Dawkins has a handicap in that his spiritual faculties are lying dormant, they have not sprouted.
B0010X745K|4.0|I just saw The Mist on Demand, and was very pleasantly surprised at the solid popcorn movie outing I purchased. After seeing all the bad reviews, along with the piss-poor Box Office non-payoff this made, I actually thought this was definately one of the BEST Stephen King-novels-turned-into-movie adaptations in quite a while.    Solid acting cast. along with good special effects and a solid storyline, all made a exciting and fun Saturady night movie night for us.
0316143472|1.0|I saw Sedaris on the TV and he reviewed (brief) his book.  I was interested, but after struggling through half the book, returned it to the library. I am very happy that I did not buy this book, as it was very boring.  I mean, who cares if grandma had worms in her legs and the gory details of her life with them! I guess of you are a Sedaris fan you would like this one. I DID NOT!
B0018SWA56|5.0|This was the second book I read by Emily Giffin; it is the sequel to \\"Something Borrowed.\\"  When the book began it was from Darcy's perspective, which at first was offputting since she is initially an unlikable character.  However - this book turns into an incredible story. Darcy does a 180' and we are rooting for her by the end.  Ms. Giffin is an amazingly gifted writer. I was totally absorbed into this book from the moment I started it until the moment it was finished - and I truly didn't want it to end. It was \\"big girl\\" chick lit, gutsy, intimate and enthralling. Highly recommended.
159562015X|1.0|I was VERY disappointed by this book, for four reasons.     First, it seems geared to those who will live their lives inside organizations. What if you are able to see and appreciate beauty and want to be an artist or create your life as a work of art? What if you are fascinated with and drawn to nature and want to live close to it and teach others to appreciate it? You won't find your strengths in these areas acknowledged here, and you won't get any help with shaping your work accordingly. The test finds what it looks for, and what it looks for seems stuck in some very early management behavior paradigm.    Second, you're given no help with figuring out how your five top strengths might be knit into a meaningful career/life.     Third, if you take the test on a off day, when you're not feeling good about yourself or are overly influenced by something that just happened, and then you want to retake the test on a better day to verify the results, you can't. You can only use the passcode one time to go through the test.    Fourth, the 34 themes are titled so sloppily that it appears the publisher didn't want to pay a good editor to make them parallel in construction. Why name the themes Achiever, Adaptability, Belief, and Command? What would have been wrong with revising these to be Achiever, Adaptor, Believer, Commander? This seems symptomatic of some really sloppy thinking. And no, Analytical was not one of my strengths, but I took the test on an off day.       I frankly don't understand all the five-star reviews and Tom Rath's success.
B001AU8ZLK|4.0|I have always been a fan of Coldplay's blend of unique harmonies and meaningful lyrics, and in their latest venture \\"Viva La Vida\\" they have had hit and miss success.  I have only listened to the album once thus far, and sometimes it takes numerous listens before the whole vibe of an album sets in, but there are certain songs, like \\"Violet Hill\\", that have \\"hit\\" written all over them and some that seem a bit in disarray.  It seems that Coldplay is still experimenting with their music instead of settling down in with what worked in the past and that can be dangerous.    In the end, I enjoyed the album, but it is my least favorite of theirs thus far.  The album just seems a bit too disjointed, with some tracks containing two almost completely different sounding songs, which they have done in the past, but it just comes off as being strange this time around.  They hanging on the precarious edge of trying to be too \\"artsy\\" for their own good.  Hopefully they will learn from this album and try to integrate more of what made them the hit band they are next time around.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Paul Giamatti plays John Adams as a cranky stickler for the moral straight line. He doesn't have the lofty ideas of a Jefferson, doesn't have Hamilton's understanding of commerce, doesn't have Washington's leadership ability, but what he does have is Abigail Adams, a woman that could be president in her own right in another century.  The woman exudes calm and common sense. John is at his best when she's about.  Unfortunately, he's in France or Holland for half a decade and is relatively unproductive on behalf of the Revolution compared to sage but randy Franklin or smooth and crafty Jefferson.    This is the story of one man's revolution, the forgotten man of early America and his fascinating lover. Adam's reputation is enhanced for posterity though his child rearing talents are not the best. HBO has spent some cash on sets, costume, and production values which elevates this historic drama far above PBS fare.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|As a whole, Coldplays past cds had a mix of decent songs with really only few songs that were really and truly amazing.  With Viva La Vida I was expecting pretty much the same thing, a cd with decent music with one or two songs that really stood out.  I was wrong.  THIS CD IS AMAZING!!!!  Coldplay has really outdone themselves.  ALL OF THE SONGS ARE WONDERFUL!   Viva La Vida's compiled of songs that are incredible as individual pieces creating one outstanding album.   Coldplay has matured tremendously since X&Y, both musically and lyrically, and even those who are not diehard Coldplay fans will be thoroughly WOWed by this cd.  VIVA LA COLDPLAY!
B00005ATQD|2.0|I just watched this, and I don't know why. It was horrible. Cruise wasn't the only bad actor in this (Kidman did a good job of course), and he was BAD. The lighting is a constant red/blue warm/cold contrast that is more headache inducing than intriguing. Whoever was guiding the camera and setting shots was lackluster and just \\"got the job done.\\" Kubrick, besides being a misogynistic f* with an adolescent appetite for his films' contents, really delivered nothing...and he took his time doing it.    This movie isn't bad because it wasn't sexy enough (I think it was sexy without need), nor because it was slow (I love slow, ponderous films), nor because there was no climax (same), it was because it was poorly directed and poorly written. The dialog is so often laughable. I was advised to see it as one of the creepiest films of all time. I never blinked. I felt like laughing at the attempts at creepiness though.    For people who want to point at the themes explored, it doesn't matter if a film brings themes up, it matters how it handles them. This did a poor, surface level job just in order that Kubrick could get his kicks out of using the F word and having nudity that isn't necessarily sexualized...oooo, how progressive!    I wasted my evening, don't waste yours.

B0018AK9RK|5.0|I knew the majority of people who buy this are not going to like it when I heard it all for the first time last week or so.  Why?  It won't be (as REVOLVER magazine stated) \\"metal enough\\".  And I agree...this cd has 4-5 metallic hard-driving songs...that is it. But what it does have is operatic overtones...brilliant singing by Halford...some of the most tasty guitar licks.  Lots of the songs are 1-2 mins of heavy heavy keyboards with Rob singing quietly over the top of them.  A lot of feeling, growth and progressive elements...think a more keyboardsy A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH by Maiden.  So if you are looking for some heavy JP...skip this one.  If you are looking to hear some of the best moments of this band then definitley buy NOSTRADAMUS.  I enjoyed the whole cd...and it grows after every listen...but you can't just crank it up and hope for 1983 SCREAMIN FOR VENGEANCE-style ferocity.  You have been warned.
6305327041|5.0|You know, I've seen this thing reviewed anywhere from one to five stars and I find that amusing.  This is a classic comedy and one of those rare movies that simply gets better and better as it goes along.  This is up there with Slapshot, No time for Sergeants, and A Night at the Opera.  The moments that are clever and funny in this movie are as clever and as funny as a movie can get.<br /><br />It's simply a movie about bellhop, played perfectly by Tim Roth, at a \\"on the way back\\" Hollywood Hotel on New Years Eve.  Bruce Willis, Marisa Tomei, Kathy Griffin, Antonio Banderas, David Proval, Jennifer Beals and Tamlyn Tomita play their parts perfectly.<br /><br />This is a movie you have to pay attention to if you want to get all the humor, much of it subtle.  This is a no-brainer 5 star comedy.  One fo the best comedies of all time.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I don't have much to say.  This is better than X&Y and just a little less good than Parachutes and Rush of Blood.  Coldplay is getting a little more artsy (somehow?).  This album should be enjoyable for everyone.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Like a million others, ive waited patiently and with baited breath for this to be released, ive just been given it as a Fathers Day presy and must admit that its not been off the media player ever since. Ive been a fan since the first album and have been impressed with the bands development release upon release. Their music has always been melancholic, graceful, surpressed and quietly understated. This album blows all that away in what can only be described as an 'awakening', after all 'Viva La Vida' does mean 'Long Live Life'. Its as if they are celebrating the success they have achieved by shouting it from the roof tops. The new songs from this album are so colourful, uplifting and a complete breath of fresh air. 'Life In Technicolour' is an instrumental introduction to proceedings which leads nicely to 'Cemetaries Of London' which has some uncharacteristic beats for Coldplay and sets the direction of the album. 'Lost' was apparantly the first song written for the album and got its inspiration from the band listening to 'Sing' by Blur off the 'Leisure' & 'Trainspotting' albums. '42' is more instant Coldplay until half way through where it changes tempo and we are treated to a great sing out loud chorus, again taking the song into a new untried dimension for the band. 'Lovers In Japan/Reign Of Love' is the first noticable track that has that Eno/U2 feel to it, 'Where The Streets Have No Name' comes to mind upon first listen. I dont agree with some reviews saying Coldplay are just U2 wannabees, I feel they have their own unique style and sound, this is just Eno putting his own stamp on the album. 'Yes/Chinese Sleep Chant' is another atmospheric tour de force with a foray into strings and another catchy beat and does sound reminiscent to something ive heard before. 'Viva La Vida' is the album stand out song for me and should be played at full volume, a crescendo of a chorus and clever use of a string section, you cant help feeling happy/liberated when you hear it, which I presume was the intent as the cover depicts 'Liberty Leading the People' by the French painter Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix which commemorates the July Revolution of 1830. 'Violet Hill' as we all know is a great lead single and showcased the risks they were taking with this release. 'Strawberry Swing''Death And All Its Friends/The Escapist' finish off the album in rousing fashion with the latter having more U2 likenesses. The album is quite short at around 45 minutes for today's standards, no lyrics included in the booklet except an indecipherable splurge of a montage in the middle, this is always a bit of a let down as you cant immediately get into the songs without them. All in all though an excellent album expertly produced and definately reassurting Coldplay at the top of the best sellers list. This will easily out sell X&Y, just watch it fly out of the shops regardless of what we all say on this site!ich I presume was the intent as the cover depicts 'Liberty Leading the People' by the French painter Eugène Delacroix which commemorates the July Revolution of 1830.

B0018OAPAW|5.0|I'm a bit biased as my brother went to school with a couple of the members and I buy all things OFSPRING...but this cd is a return to glory for the So Cal punks.    I'm not much of a \\"punk\\" fan...I lean more towards metal but I have always had an affinity for this band simply beacuse of the way they capture the Orange County, California sound and vibe...some may hate it...most dig it.    This cd has a bunch of quick, uptempo numbers as well as some thoughtful lyrics...put together by a band that just plain rocks.    Definitely worth the 4 1/2 year wait.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|This is a great CD. I liked the first single, \\"Mercy\\" and after listening to some samples from the rest of the CD - I went for it. This CD has really grown on me, Duffy does a great variation of a kind-of 1960's Soul sound with a twist.... One of my favorite songs is \\"Stepping Stone\\" and I like the title track: \\"Rockferry\\" too, but they're all good or better. You can just enjoyably let it play from beginning to end.
0385341067|1.0|Mister Pip is a strange novel. It's imperialist and racist, but cloaks it well enough that many intelligent and progressive people like the story it tells. Look at that story: young native kids are taught to have an imagination by the merest exposure to the great art of the British Empire. Somehow, Dickens has some relevance to their lives, and they come to appreciate the author and the storyteller--their aged, sagacious White Teacher--more than they do their own parents' stories. Of course, in the end, the White Teacher is destroyed by ignorant savages. That's the way all of these stories must end.
B000BCE918|5.0|I have seen all three Jurassic Park movies and love them. Each of them has a new plot, but has the same characters. I love science fiction movies, so this is a keeper. The first one is how a Jurassic Park on an island crashes and how the dinosaurs roam free and terrize the people still on the island. The second movie is how the characters go to a second island where the cloning took place for the dinosaurs. The third movie is about Allen Grant getting tricked onto Isla Sorna (second island) to find a couple's missing son. All three movies are action packed and have excellent computer animation! I HIGHLY recommend the trilogy to any sci-fi or dinosaur fan.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|Saying that Judas Priest are back in 08 with a vengeance may be an exaggeration, but Nostradamus-- at the very least-- proves that this classic band is not about to be a forgotten as a relic of metal past. More than a concept album, the band has created a true rock opera on a scale that challenges the grandiosity of any album before it.<br /><br />But is it any good? The answer to that is subjective. First, you have to accept that Judas Priest is getting old and simply doesn't have enough energy to create another Painkiller. So, if you are a diehard fan of Judas Priest's screeching metal sound, you will probably hate this, because it is much slower. But if you have an open mind, or happened to LOVE \\"A Touch of Evil\\", you just might be able to appreciate Nostradamus the way I do. That's because Nostradamus sounds like it took that song, and expanded it enough to become the foundation for the entire album's sound. By listening to \\"Dawn of Creation\\" from start to finish, you will get an instrumental preview of the brand new elements that Judas Priest have come to embrace, which include classical instrumentation, orchestra, piano, and electronic beats. Yes, you read that correctly, but don't judge just yet. Where this album really shines is when these elements allow Judas Priest to--I don't want to say \\"transcend\\"--but, to effectively \\"break through\\" the typical boundaries of metal to create some fantastic music. Instead of straightforward, instant, head-bashing gratification, these songs provide a powerful experience that benefits from your full attention. As examples, songs like \\"New Beginnings\\" and \\"Alone\\" actually have emotional backbone, while others like \\"Revelations\\", and \\"Conquest\\", and \\"Nostradamus\\" sound more epic. \\"Visions\\" is great with minimal production as well.<br /><br />I strongly suggest that you don't listen to the album in order, however. One thing that holds this album back is the way the songs are arranged. While making sense plot-wise, musically... not so much. If you're like me you'll be bored before Act 2 even begins. By playing Nostradamus on random you get a more even mix of rock song and ballad.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a huge step forward for Judas Priest's sound in general, but it leaves much to desire in the metal department, which is somewhat disappointing considering Halford and co. are the \\"Gods of Metal\\" and all.f you're like me you'll be bored before Act 2 even begins.

B0007Y08QA|4.0|I saw this movie a few years ago and I always recommend it to friends. I have to warn you, don't watch it of you're tired or uncommitted. The first half hour are slow moving and the movie is filmed in a black and white type atmosphere. This is a great story with a resolution. Afterwards, you'll be thinking \\"Woah, is that what happened? That actually makes sense.\\" No tricks or unresolved issues here.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This is why they are the best band in the world. All of the critics and some fans who are giving this album negative reviews are simply out of their minds. It's completely new and different from anything ever recorded and in years to come will be viewed as an essential album.

B000NA28I4|1.0|I think the characters fit pretty well for this movie, but the movie CLEARLY does not compare to the book. The movie does not follow the storyline whatsoever. It's basically on its own. I hope they don't make a sequal for this as it would totally corrupt the story. I don't recommend this movie to any big Inheritance fan.
B0018C7Q5Q|5.0|Well first  I'm going to tell what I liked about Lees so called Hulk and going I'm going to tell you what I really liked about The Incredible Hulk. I will also tell what problems the Hulk had and if they fixed it in the new First Hulk.    It started out really slow. Plus they did this comic book trick with some of the scenes that was pretty dumb. I did however like the action. I think it would have been a better idea to let one of the dogs go and latter on he could fight again. The acting wasn't that good. I thought that they shouldn't have cast Eric Bana as Dr. Banner. I thought he was a little to buff to be him. I thought The Hulk looked good at times but also thought it looked to green. Nick Nolte was really bad in his role. The fight towards the end wasn't all that good either.     Problems    1. Bad Acting  2. Comic Book scenes  3. Bad Casting  4. Hulk didn't look right  5. Not that much good action    Second The Incredible Hulk    This was a very fast paced movie but good. The casting here was so perfect here. I really liked Tim Roth as Blonskey. He was a really better villain than in the other Hulk movie. I also liked the story telling. The best things here is the acting and the cgi . The Hulk green was toned down and looked better. Especially during dark scenes. The abomination looked  good to. The acting was also better in this movie. I also liked how the set up the next villain in the next movie. It also sets up also a future Avengers movie. Now for the action. It was 100x better now. The visuals during the college fight was so nicely done when they shot this sound cannon at him. The big showdown between The Hulk and The Abomination was so cool. Also it was very violent and physical. There was no problems here. They fixed everything.      Compared to this and Ironman. Story wise I like Ironman. Action wise I choose The Incredible Hulk. They improved a lot better with this movie. I'm hoping this movie will get people back on track to go see a good movie when the first movie (like The Hulk) sucked.
006135323X|3.0|Why do we make so many mistakes?  This book provides many rational answers to that question. But some explanations of some of the experiments become too tedious. However, it is possible to skip over these parts and pick it up again when the tedium ends and miss out only on less than essential details about why we tend to so often cross our wires when making decisions.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|i never really liked coldplay but i downloaded this cd off of amazon mp3. it is very good. different from their other stuff. i'm in love with the song \\"viva la vida\\".

B0017VG69U|4.0|Well, yes, I was one of the stupid consumers that bought an HD player for the sole purpose of playing the first season in Hi-Def.  What adds insult to injury is I purchased the player from Amazon in anticipation.  Since the player arrived before the release of the 1st season, I was slightly too early on my HD player purchase to qualify for the phaser remote promotion.  Why didn't Amazon warn me???!!<br />Anyway, I'm stuck with an HD player (and yes I own a blu-ray too, I'm that stupid), and while the discs are beautiful, I was nervous when the announcement was made to scrap HD players.  So, I am thankful they will be released, even if it is just in Standard def.  Please, please - I hope they don't eventually put them on Blue-ray.  A stupid consumer can only take so much!
B0001XAPY2|2.0|A known fact about Hayao Miyazaki is his love for classic planes. In 1992 he brought his love of planes to life in the high flying adventure 'Porco Rosso'. This is the tale of Marco Rossillini. Once a proud Italian air force pilot,too proud for his own good which brought curse a on him. The curse, you guessed it turned him into a pig. Now a beloved outlaw constantly foiling the crimes of notorious air pirate gangs they have brought Porco his match in the egotistical American Jack Curtis. Now with a new enemy Porco has to stop being pig headed and have a little faith in his friends. Only then can he rise against Curtis and become a real airborne legend.<br /><br />I had been told this is one of the most beloved Studio Ghibli films, but unfortunatly it didn't really work for me. The voice acting was great having some legends like Michael Keaton and Brad Garret, who practically stole the show as Boss. It was the story that was just too simple for me. The begining and ending sequences are so much fun filled with amazing planes bright colors and hysterical moments, but there is really no meat in between the two. The only thing I did like was his origin and how he got the curse and all this talk about him being a pig was just a tad over done. Still, I am glad I got to see it and I would say it's a movie to see maybe you will have a better time watching it.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|I knew with Brian Eno in on this cd, it was gonna be great, and it is. I have lost interest in cold play a cd or 2 ago, but with viva la vida the group is back on track. With tracks like violet hill, strawberry swing and viva la vida you just cant go wrong. For the fans who, and there will be some who think it sucks, i guess you guys just want cookie cutter music or the same sound on every cd. I am glad they did something different, because it works. So with that, good work guys, keep it up. love the cd. I am a fan all over agian.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Uncle Eddy and Clark W. Griswald are back in National Lampoom's Christmas Vacation. I personally think this one is the best of all the Lampoom's movies. Clark and his family are preparing for a great Christmas together with their parents when Uncle Eddy and his family unexpectantly arrive. From their everything goes downhill for Clark. (again) Hilarious movie, but does unfortunately have some language to it. (I won't write any examples) But overall this movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen. I highly recommend it for any National Lampoom fan!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I'm a fan, right from the start with Kirk and company.  I was annoyed when ST:TNG came out, because I thought, \\"How could they?\\" But I gave it a fair chance, and loved it!  Next DS9, haven't had the chance yet, but will eventually get to it (wasn't thrilled with the whole \\"war\\" premise).  When Voyager came into the spotlight, I was skeptical yet again, figuring it couldn't have the real \\"Star Trek feel\\" being stuck in space.  I didn't even watch it initially.  But it is an excellent show too!  Now to Enterprise - I swore to myself I'd give it a fair chance the first time around, and watched it religiously and in much anticipation for each coming week.  I enjoyed the show while I was watching it, but found it to be hard to follow - especially with the multiple story arcs throughout the last two seasons.  Being the devoted fan, I had to have it when it was released on DVD.  I only recently opened and viewed each season, episode after episode and let me tell you, watching it in this manner made a lot of sense!  I had come to realize how intricate the plots can be, the characters, multi-demensional, and the effects are truly amazing.  The writers took a big, bold chance with continuing arcs, and that was a nice nod to the fans.  They were not trying to carefully step on eggshells and write individual stories.  They were giving a gift to fans, knowing those who were following each week would be the only ones returning for the next installment.  Watching one eppy after the next, I was like, \\"Wow!\\"  that's good writing!  The characters were as they should be - newbies in the universe, and not knowing quite how to proceed.  They were flawed, made bad (and good, really good) decisions.  They learned from their mistakes and experiences, and grew accordingly - but never lost sight of the qualities that Roddenberry had envisioned for future of the human race.
B000YAA68C|5.0|My wife held a gun on me and forced me to watch this romantic comedy. I briefly debated to myself which would hurt more, the movie or the bullet. But within five minutes I was hooked.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film. It's touching and memorable. What's her name is great as the female lead and that Spartan King dude does a brilliant job of playing a dead guy. This movie has the power to remind men how nice it is to be in love with someone you actually like.<br /><br />Okay, a lot of guys will notice that this movie is missing the standard quota of murders, explosions, rapes and decapitations. But don't dismiss it fellas, there is still a fine story here.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"PS, I love you.\\" Men, pass on the blood, cars and guns for once and rent this film tonight to watch with your girlfriend or wife. The evening will go well, trust me.<br /><br />--Guy P. Harrison, author of<br /><br />Race and Reality: What Everyone Should Know About Our Biological Diversity<br /><br />and<br /><br />50 Reasons People Give for Believing in a God
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|In my opinion, the only thing that artists \\"owe\\" fans, or even people in general for that matter, is putting forth their best effort and I feel that this is what Coldplay did with this album.     Some have said that this album was made solely to appeal to critics who have, surprisingly, responded with rave reviews.  The way I see it, critics by the very definition of their title, critque things about albums and provide the most honest feedback to artists and so I don't think that Coldplay was necessarily pandering to the critics for their approval, but rising to the challenge of creating a great body of work without going back to their old bag of tricks that seem to keep some of these reviewers (namely those expressing their utter disappointment) amused and satisified.   If I wanted to hear something that sounded like \\"the scientist\\", I'd go and listen to (that's right you guessed it) \\"the scientist\\" off of their earlier album...      Seriously, when you read a book do you hope that the 4th chapter is just like the 3rd or do you look for the focus/story to progress and even take you somewhere you never even knew it could go?
B0000793ZB|5.0|This is maybe the kind of album that should come along later in a band's career when everyone is paying attention to them.   Though a big hit when released, I'm not sure how many people are aware of it now or the band.  To my ears it has aged very well in that some 80's music has too much synthesizer for today's tastes.   There are several brilliant songs and every song is enjoyable.   The bridge for \\"Alive and Kicking\\" is one of my favorite moments on the album.
B00099BPP6|5.0|To all those who cannot accept Fischer-Dieskau as Rigoletto, you are missing a truly great interpretation. Of course he's not Italian, but then Pablo Casals was not German when he played Bach. In fact, the Cello Suites offer a good example of how many different but equally great ways there are to play the same piece. Of course Gobbi's interpretation of Rigoletto is the most dramatic, etc.; but Fischer-Dieskau brings out a different dimension of pathos that is equally desireable. Bergonzi, of course, is worth the price of admission, but Kubelik is the big surprise. He find an almost chamber-music dimension to this great opera of duets, trios, quartets, etc. Much as I love the Gobbi-Callas recording, this one would be my \\"Desert Island\\" version.
0740748475|5.0|I got this as a Christmas gift for one of my best friends, and it was a hit -- I only wish I bought one for myself! If you're a Calvin and Hobbes fan, this is a must have... you can spend hours at a time reading it. Bill Watterson is a genius.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Was eagerly waiting for this album since long. Getting an album in hand on its release day is not easy when you are sitting in a country like Bangladesh. Advance order system came of help. However, that's a long, different story altogether. Coming to the heart of the matter: the single \\"Violet Hill\\" was available in the net for last 2 months or so; downloaded that and got hugely inspired to get the full album in hand. Today listened to it, all 10 songs and gave the album a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Coldplay was not in my list of favorite bands of 2000s though I liked Parachute a lot. My favorites from current decade are: The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys, Interpol, Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinand, Audioslave and of course Elbow; and to some extent Death Cab for Cuties, Foo Fighters (ESPG album), Radiohead (for their best album so far i.e. In Rainbows which came during this decade), Weezer, Mew and Wilco. The list can actually get a little longer than this because I am someone who lives in music (more specifically in Indie & Alternative rocks)thorough & thorough. Music is not a mere passion for me, it's something (in fact the only thing) that keeps me going. My \\"lifeblood\\", to say the least (borrowing from Manic Street Preachers' album name - they are another great band from the Britpop era and if you have not listened to their newest relase titled \\"Send Away the Tigers\\", which was released during this decade, you have truly missed something).<br /><br />To come back to the point, I have somewhat resisted myself all along from putting Coldplay in the list of my favorites (thereby listening to them a lot less than I listen to my favorites). But no more. After devouring Viva La Vida, now I know why Mr Martin deserves all the hype and media attention that his band - luckily - recieve always.<br /><br />Coldplay to me was always something like: typed, too subdued for my taste, something where same pattern / same format gets repeated, and something which takes long time to get into. And there was also this stupid comment I heard in Copenhagen in 2006 from a bookstore owner: \\"Coldplay? You like Coldplay, huh? They are a gay band, man.\\" This got into my head (nothing wrong if somebody is a gay or whatever, but somehow this comment from a music buff uttered in a foreign land on a foggy winter morning got seriously into my head and made me prejudiced towards Coldplay).<br /><br />Today I am throwing away all those and putting in Coldplay in my list of favorites. It's an honor they have done to me, to the millions of other music lovers like me, by producing and releasing such a stunning collection of songs where all 10 tracks are loveable ones and none of the 10 tracks takes more than just one listening to fall in love with. \\"Violet Hill\\" still remains the best and after 3 listenings, I think \\"Yes\\" is a great song. I think this album will be hailed by all pundits as the best album Coldplay has produced so far. Congratulations to Brian Eno also. He showed why he is the Brian Eno (to me he however is the creator of one of my all time favorite songs \\"By This River\\".)

0316143472|4.0|I heard this pitched as a book for those who love joy.  While it's maybe not as outrageous or as focused as Me Talk Pretty and Dress your Family, there are absolutely laugh out loud moments throughout.  It's worth the purchase if you're looking for an afternoon of voyeurism and the comfort that comes from knowing that you're not alone in your weird dark habits and quirks.

B000002L1L|5.0|It is so hard for the casual fan to keep track of what line up they are  listening to when putting on a post-1980 album from DP.  Steve Morse? Joe Lynn Turner?  With this album, the listener is pleasantly surprised to get the classic \\"Made In Japan\\" line up that we all love (the last album to have it).  The listener is rewarded even further with a REALLY GREAT album.  This album has classic DP licks and riffs from beginning to end, with strong songwriting throughout.      Bottom Line:  Weed this album out from the others.  It is likely their best effort since the band refromed for Perfect Strangers.
B000003BEM|5.0|The Rolling Stones-Beggars Banquet *****<br /><br />Lets, just for arguments sake say that Beggars Banquet is the best Rolling Stones record ever made. It wouldn't be a hard thing to argue and many would agree with that claim. Beggars was the album that started the classic four albums from the Stones. This, [[ASIN:B00006AW2G Let It Bleed [DSD]]], [[ASIN:B000JLOHMW Sticky Fingers + 7 Bonus Tracks]], and [[ASIN:B00001R3GI Exile On Main Street [Limited Edition]]] all make up this classic period and are all essential to a collection, and maybe Beggars more than any other. Where Let It Bleed was unique, Sticky Fingers was the hardest rocker, and Exile is well it's Exile, Beggars is just perfect.<br /><br />Brian Jones made his exit with this album as he was only on parts of Let It Bleed and it shows. He did his best playing here. The slide on 'Jig-Saw Puzzle' a tender ballad of sorts that on gets better with each passing listen. The sliding-blues-stomp of 'Parachute Woman' is uniquely Jones. But perhaps what is most impressive about Beggars is the fact that you don't hear Keith Richards' guitar for about the first three minutes of the album until he plays one of the greatest guitar solos of all time on 'Sympathy For The Devil' (which is rumoured by some to actually be Jimmy Page of Zeppelin as he was known for his studio appearances, and it does sound like him) perhaps the groups darkest song. For me what is so impressive is the key work through out, often over looked so take a second listen. Their reworking of 'No Expectations' exceeds the original by miles while 'Dear Doctor' is straight country honk at it's finest, and that's only side one.<br /><br />Side two begins with the classic protest of 'Street Fighting Man' which may or may not be that greatest Bob Dylan song that Dylan never wrote. 'Prodigal Son' will take time for new fans to appreciate but it's worth the wait. 'Stray Cat Blues' is an unheralded classic that never was paid it's dues, but is among the bands best of the period. 'Factory Girl' and the blue collar feel of 'Salt Of The Earth' close the album to perfect avail.<br /><br />Mick, Keith and Brian made their first 'TRUE' classic with Beggars. It's a shame Brian became a tragedy soon after. Beggars Banquet is a rare album in rock n' roll, there really isn't another like it!ctory Girl' and the blue collar feel of 'Salt Of The Earth' close the album to perfect avail.

B0018OAPAW|5.0|Yeah, I know I say this every time but this time The Offspring have truly delivered their best work, possibly, ever. Anything you've ever liked about this group is on this CD in full force; their heavy and fast songs, their rants against society, their SoCal punk roots, and their slower and more \\"human\\" songs. After experimenting a bit with a heavier sound with their last CD, Splinter, the Offspring have gone back to something a lot more resembling what their fans have come to expect from them. This CD includes possibly any sound the band's ever done, as well as some new branching out and Dexter expresses some of his best vocal range as well.     Half-Truism starts the CD out with a song that perfectly captures what makes the Offspring so excellent and unique. The melody's perfect, the vocals are perfect...really a song that perfectly sums up what makes this band so great. Lyrics are memorable, too. \\"If we don't make it alive, it's a hell of a good day to die. All our light that shines strong, only lasts for so long.\\" A great \\"lighters\\" song. REALLY atmospheric bridge, too. 5/5    Trust In You sounds like something that combines the Splinter sound with the Conspiracy of One sound and it's very fast and would probably sound perfect live. Great guitar work, as well. Another nearly perfect song with a great and exciting hook. 5/5    You're Gonna Go Far Kid features the band's best guitar solo since The Kids Aren't Alright and has a GREAT beat to it. Very different, very unique, but again catchy as hell. Worked perfectly for me. 5/5    Hammerhead's the heaviest song they've ever done. It's also the most interesting-sounding, and definitely different than anything they've done before. Powerful chorus, great musically, ...lyrically it's not the best, and the second half of the song sounded a little on the cheesy side to me, personally. Although it ends on a strong note. 3/5    A Lot Like Me features its own sound and its a darker song that's very interesting lyrically. More great \\"new sound\\" stuff. Good stuff. 4/5    Takes Me Nowhere reminds me again of some Splinter stuff, (Never Gonna Find Me,) and it's not exactly a standout but it's yet another really good one. 4/5    Kristy, Are You Okay is when the band begins to venture into slower territory. While these slower songs (there's another one on the CD) definitely aren't this band's strength, it's a perfectly good listen. While I'm glad the Offspring are experimenting, this type of song is very \\"new Green Day\\" and this CD did an AMAZING job of AVOIDING doing that, keeping the Offspring's hardcore sound intact. This was a nice song but definitely NOT the future of the band. As long as they realize that then we're good. 3/5    Nothingtown features a great return to the more \\"fun\\" Americana sound, (mixed with I Want You Bad) and I missed it a bit on Splinter. It's a really nice song that seems to mix the GOOD of, say, Green Day but also the best of the Offspring. Great stuff. Cool lyrics, too. 5/5    Stuff is Messed Up's like this decade's Americana. (The song.) While not as catchy as that song, it's a really funny song that's extremely true, as well. Pretty funny way of naming it, too. (Listen to it and you'll know what I mean.) Dexter's delivery of that line (especially the third time,) couldn't be more perfect. 4/5    Fix You reminds me a bit of Denial, Revisited from Conspiracy of One but better. It's much faster than Kristy and actually has a good vocal from Dexter. The production's pretty top-notch, as well. Great ending. 5/5    Let's Hear it for Rock Bottom took a listen or two for me to really like, but it's a song that kind of reminds me of the old \\"punk rock\\" songs from SoCal. Good. Nice beach song. 4/5    Rise and Fall, admittedly, I hoped would be a bit of a heavier song. But it's decent. Kind of a skater song, reminiscent of the good (old school) Green Day. Would fit great on the soundtrack to the first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Good lyrics. Sorta made me wish there was a\\"Rage and Grace\\" song on the CD as well. 3/5    Easily the best CD The Offspring's ever made. If you've ever liked anything about this band...it's represented on this CD. The heavier stuff from their indie CD's represented here as well, times 10. It's also got some great new stuff on it and easily the best \\"hit-or miss\\" ratio I think ever on their CD's. It makes their last 2 CD's (ones I really liked initially but that had virtually NO staying power) look like complete jokes in comparison. Every Offspring fan needs to purchase this CD and everyone who wants to listen to a group AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME needs to check this CD out immediately, it doesn't have a single bad song on there, it's a near 10-minutes longer than their way-too-short Splinter, the CD booklet's top-notch, going back to animation and featuring some evocative imagery, it's got the Parental Advisory sticker again....great stuff. Near-perfect CD for any Offspring/rock fan. More \\"5-star\\" songs than I think I've ever heard on a CD.
B00005JM0B|4.0|This one is not the instant classic that the first and (especially) the second, but it holds up well enough as a good action movie. It is not as intense as the first. Nor is it as insightful as the second. The aim this time around is simply to have fun, and it meets that goal very well.<br /><br />Arnold is back here in his likely last appearance as a terminator from the future, and, despite the years that have passed since the first outing, he looks very much the same, as he should. Kristanna Loken is a welcome addition to the pantheon of terminator models, becoming both very sensual and very eerie.<br /><br />You may feel that the movie should have done more to deal with the concepts of fate and free will, like was discussed in the previous movie, but if you merely want to watch a movie that has great effects, great action and passably charismatic characters, you could do worse than this movie.
0618001905|5.0|This book was among the best I have read this year. I had no idea as to the atrocities committed in the Congo around the turn of the century until I picked up this book. While Hochschild goes into great lengths to expose King Leopold II and his horrible deeds, he still maintains great objectivity and examines WHY Leopold may have acted in the manner that he did. I would love for Hochschild to look more into Leopolds mistress Caroline. That is a book I would definetly pick up.
B0010X745K|4.0|For me \\"The Mist\\" short story was one of the scariest of King's (And I've read 90%+ of his stuff). I love King's books but the same horror his books instill just does not always translate to the movie screen. For me, \\"The Mist\\" the movie is a strange entity, I'm not sure I liked it, in fact I'm pretty sure I did NOT like it. However, I didn't like it because it was horrifying (and thats a good sign of a good horror movie right?).     This movie had my heart racing, had me shouting at the TV, \\"Don't Open the DOOR!!!\\", and pacing the floor after the ending. So in the end, the fact that I had a strong reaction to the film compels me to give it a fairly high rating. I can't really say why I reacted so, although i think its because I'm a dad now and there was a little boy in jeopardy most of the film. So, if you are in the mood for a really horrifying (different from scary or gross or freaky) movie The Mist is worth checking out.     One last thing, the ending is not the same as the book and is terribly depressing, you'll see....
0316143472|1.0|From the preveiw i expected this book to be funny, witty and insightful. I was very dissapointed after the  first few days of reading it.<br />This book was a complete waste of money.
B00005N5S5|4.0|This is a classic movie to the point where it has become a serious cliche. However it is well made and finely paced. The soundtrack is seriously '80s but otherwise fine. Most importantly, however, this movie paved the road for the very excellent second movie.<br /><br />The effects are dated, but they work well enough for the movie because they are shot with competence and an eye towards the end result of the movie.<br /><br />Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton work well together and Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast here in a rare (for him at least) villain role.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I don't have much to add about what they sound like...the other reviewers took care of that.  I'm basically just here to say that I love this band.  I think they're amazing.  Instant favorites.  I'm so happy I found them.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|After repeated listenings, I have no doubt in my mind that \\"CRAYONS\\" truly deserves a 5-star rating! The way to appreciate this new set is not to have any expectations at all because we tend to compare new material with previous ones. We tend to look for another \\"MAC ARTHUR PARK\\" or \\"LAST DANCE\\" or \\"HOT STUFF\\" in any new Donna set.    The songs in the \\"CRAYONS\\" cd are an eclectic bunch because of Donna's collaborations with new and younger producers and songwriters. As a result, while each song is different, each song truly pleases. Best tracks: ALL. My favorite tracks: STAMP YOUR FEET, CRAYONS, THE QUEEN IS BACK, SAND ON MY FEET, DRIVIN DOWN BRAZIL, SCIENCE OF LOVE, BE MYSELF AGAIN, I'M A FIRE.     The best thing about this new cd is that DONNA SUMMER, THE QUEEN, IS BACK, and her vocals after all these years remain UNDIMINISHED in  POWER, DEPTH, & CLARITY. HAIL TO THE QUEEN...SHE'S BACK!!! Among my favorite tracks, I think the campy \\"THE QUEEN IS BACK,\\" the gorgeous \\"SAND ON MY FEET\\" and the wonderful \\"SCIENCE OF LOVE\\" can all be huge pop hits if released as singles. To Burgundy Records / Sony, we hope you will continue to support the \\"CRAYONS\\" cd and further promote the rest of the potential hit singles in the album. We hope that Donna makes a follow-up album soon. Bravo to Sony!
0446402389|5.0|Tom Rob Smith, kept me on the edge of my seat from the first page to the last! for a debut novel its as the hes been writing for decades! The book was worth every Penny!, and when i was finished i just wanted to follow the characters throughout their lives! This Is a great book!
B00008PC2O|5.0|This is one of the rare sequels that not only lives up to but surpasses the original. The music and effects have been ramped up a notch, and the pacing is perfect for the story they are telling here. More importantly, however, the interaction between the characters is just perfectly done and the story has some very deep overtones. The idea of taking your destiny into your own hands is portrayed here excellently.<br /><br />Speaking more of the minutia of the movie, the role reversal done with Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator character is a wonderful touch. The idea of a villain reformed is great. Plus the fact that this machine spends much of the movie learning what exactly it is to be human. One particular line at the end is delivered very simply but very poignantly: I know now why you cry, but it is something I can never do.<br /><br />This movie is the rare one that is effectively action-packed, spectacular, poignant, touching and insightful.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|I have read the book, listened to the audio too while traveling and ultimately viewed the DVD HBO series. When the DVD arrived I was really excited to view it. However, after the first two episodes of the series, the series definitely took the darker and gloomy side of Adams. The book overwhelmingly displayed a more humorous man and certainly more caring man for his family -- especially toward his children. The series left me more in doubt of the connection between the author's view and the director's view of Adams. The author saw more of the human, where as the director seem to portray Adams as a maniacal man bent on paranoia and selfishness.<br /><br />Our education system of the 60's didn't even come close to revealing the tremendous work Adams had in our independence. David McCullough did an outstanding job of revealing the 'real' father of our country... John Adams... thank you Mr. McCullough! You're honest and clear portrayal of John Adams opened my eyes and magnified my appreciation for what he did to liberate the American people from the chains of the monarchies of the past.<br /><br />The other revelation that came as a result of reading the book is the almost full circle we have made in just 200 years! The blood, tears and treasure spent to free us from oppression, the same oppression is slowly being over shadowed by the abundance of the aristocracy and monarchs of our time. Slowly they are eroding the liberty that our forefathers won and established. As amendment after amendment is added to their Constitution, it is slowly evolving into another document where the liberty to pursue our happiness is slowly stolen from us and taxation without representation has revived its parasitical head.<br /><br />After listening to the wisdom of those gifted men of our newly formed nation, I have found that we American people have become a very ignorant offspring...<br /><br />Where are the Adams like Statesmen of our day?!
B0011NVC9I|5.0|The Directors Cut of BEOWULF is phenomenally excellent with its superb art, styled with the skill of some great actors driving some of the best animation behind brilliant representations of mythic creatures and humans as heroes and Super Heroes.The film pushes the envelope of current technology and surpasses any regular standard if entertainment.The story of BEOWULF is both elucidated, and expanded upon by current scholarly efforts, as well as the wizardly story minds of the screen writers of BEOWULF.Through the story, the actors add to the mythic element of the story with over the top performances, and the animators add design styles that flamboyantly expand the world of story such that the characters played by each actor can be magnified greatly; and in one flourish the one actress who embodies all of this is Angleina Jolie who manages to go into that Mythic Realm with what looks like a full body scan, and in so doing becomes part of the mother shape shifters beautiful form, and yet Angelina manages  to do this in a way that still retains her worldly self. The Story cuts a swathe through time that few can emulate but Angelina truly embodies.    THE DVD EXTRAS: These show much if the behind the scenes elements in how the motion capture works. In a slight way it is like a magicians tricks being revealed so it is a little disappointing in that regard, but very enlightening; especially since the Angelina Jolie Sequences are never touched on in the making of stories.However, the story to script coverage is very good and makes an entertaining watch.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Whereas X&Y took literally months for me to really appreciate (and I still think it's just \\"ok\\"), this album only took a few listens, and each new listen is decisively rewarded. Different and varied enough to challenge the ear, yet familiar and accessible enough to be just beautiful. On some level, I believe you can say that about all four Coldplay albums, as they all have their own unique sound without betraying Coldplay's successful brand of musicality.<br /><br />All the tracks are great (really), but here are my favorites:<br />\\"Lost!\\" (Not \\"Lost?\\" as some people seem to prefer. I think the percussion on the album version works wonders, personally. Grabs your attention from the start.)<br />\\"Lovers in Japan\\" (Perhaps the most \\"U2-sounding\\" track on the album. It soars!)<br />\\"Strawberry Swing\\" (The bright multi-layered guitar sound and stirring bass-line are stunning! A true song for summer.)<br />and \\"Death and All His Friends\\" (On par with \\"Amsterdam,\\" with it's soft piano beginning, then rocking into an anthem that's sure to blow the house down in concert and have everyone singing at the top of their lungs! Can't wait.)<br /><br />The only thing I found at all annoying about this album were the \\"double-tracks,\\" as I would call them. Essentially, putting two (very different) songs on the same track. This happens several times on the album, and I found it to be unnecessary, as a whole. Sometimes it works (\\"Lovers in Japan\\"), sometimes not (\\"Yes\\", \\"Death and All His Friends\\"). They would have been better off just giving the songs separate track numbers! But that's a small complaint on my part.<br /><br />I love this album, to put it simply. After listening to it almost non-stop for the last week, it still manages to sound fresh and invigorating. Welcome back, Coldplay!

B001AU8ZLK|3.0|Coldplay's 4th musical adventure came with the most anticipation of any album this year.  After months of hype, and all the pushing back of the release date, many fans were hoping this would be their best album to date, but sadly, all the excitement was in vain. Viva La Vida is forgettable.      Like most albums are these days, there are 2 or 3 tracks on there that are good.  But Coldplay fans are used to falling in love with ALL of the songs.  While trying to figure out why I didn't connect with this album, I realized that while it's very experimental and different and interesting, you can't connect with it! It's just not good; for Coldplay standards that is.      Most of the songs on here don't have that special something like, yellow, trouble, in my place, green eyes, the scientist, and fix you all had.  It's been three years since there last release and this is what those three years produced, a short album filled with tracks barely worthy of being b-sides.  And I say `barely' because many of their b-sides are usually great songs!  The album reminds me of a weird painting that you look at because it's kind of strange, and very different. It's interesting, and technically speaking it's all done very well but it doesn't speak to you, and it's not a painting that one would fall in love with. Until now, I, along with countless other fans have fallen in love with each of Coldplay's albums, all different from their previous ones, but not too different that you can't recognize them. The album has no flow, and is way too experimental.     In many interviews prior to the release of the album, Coldplay had stated that this album would not play it safe, and that they wanted this album to make it ok for someone to admit they listen to Coldplay. But it seems in attempt to shake their reputation of \\"wuss rock\\", they strayed from the very things the fans loved and what made them Coldplay.

0446614459|2.0|PLOT: Once Sean King was one of the best agents in the Secret Service. But one day his attention was diverted for only a split second and a presidential candidate was killed right next to him. So Sean had to leave the Service. 8 years later Secret Service agent Michelle Maxwell lets a presidential candidate out of her sight and in that short moment the candidate disappears. Two completely different incidents, no common denominator, no link between the two agents. And yet their destinies are interdependent. They need each other and they need to solve the riddle. One to save her future, one to dispel the demons of his past...    The premise of the book is really great and promised long time of continuous reading. Also the two main characters are really great and well developed - as a reader you just must love them. And of course there are several twists and turns in the book that will make you wonder about the link between the two incidents. I stayed up long hours to get closer to the answer. 'Who' and especially 'Why' were the main questions I asked myself again and again. But I could not solve the riddle. Maybe because new characters were introduced repeatedly and there are lots of dead ends during the agent's investigation?  The introduction of a third ex Secret Service agent as another main character is unexpected and also a bit strange because I never got rid of the feeling that the motive and the behavior of that person did not fit in. And Sean's connection with that agent is really strange after all what happened. On the other hand the story would not work without that character.    OK every book has flaws.  For once you wonder why the perpetrator is always so well informed and at the right spot at the right time right from the start. Furthermore it seems very strange that he is able to set up Sean and Michelle so easily all the time - doing things he should not be able to. You also wonder why that person does not stop the two agents early in their investigation.  Second, you wonder why Sean and Michelle split for each night when already somebody attempted to kill them. Shouldn't they watch each other's back a lot closer?  Third, after a while you do not need to be a genius to figure out what distracted Sean during his duty 8 years earlier. But you wonder why nobody else saw what he saw [or why it was not captured on film etc.] and why he never mentioned it to anybody. (The explanation for it later on is kind of lame.)    Nevertheless most of the flaws mentioned are minor and do not really spoil the fun of reading.    Unfortunately towards the end of the book something really strange happened. Something that I have never experienced before. The first three quarters of the book I had difficulties to put it down because it was so thrilling. The closer I came to the ending though, I had a strange urge to slow down reading. It might be because both tension and pace slow down in the end. Or the fear that the ending with all its conclusions and explanations would not be satisfying. Regrettably the fear was justified.  The ending is really disappointing and could even be called ridiculous or plain stupid.  Somebody plans for years and creates this clever plot - all for that?! That is really lame. Nobody with a motive like that would go through all the difficulties to create such a scenario. Or you need a better and stronger motive to do so. Sorry Mr. Baldacci but I am not buying it!    Looking back at the other two Baldacci books I read (\\"Last Man Standing\\" + \\"The Simple Truth\\") I have a hunch that there might be a general problem with his books: The start is brilliant, the tension is high, you cannot put the book aside but at the end you are not happy with the solution. From those 3 books \\"Split Second\\" is the weakest one because the ending is really, really extremely bad/stupid/ridiculous/unbelievable/poor/lame and it ruins the whole story. Therefore 2 stars only.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Nothing really new here: a little Alanis, a good bit of Avril and throw in some Pink while your at it.  But these catchy songs will be swimming through your head all summer.  Probably 5 or 6 bona fide top 40 hits on this disk.  Katy's voice is impeccable, the lyrics better than average and the music is great.  I'd probably have given it five stars had it been a bit more original and been more guitar-oriented.  Katy's definitely going to be around for awhile.

0143038419|4.0|It was hard to put this book down, until the final third.  Gilbert's description of the end of her marriage, followed by her determination to recover in Italy, India, and Bali were engrossing.  The descriptions of her experiences in Italy and in the ashram in India, whatever their limitations, were enlightening and even charming.      The problem, and probably the source of some of the reviewers' criticisms, is the book's final phase in Bali, where the author inexplicably shifts from appreciative descriptions of people whom she likes to a kind of cutesy \\"look at me, aren't I just amazing\\" literary voice.  The change is a disappointment, and some of your reviewers have reacted badly.
B00005JPS6|5.0|Bee Movie was actually to my suprise pretty good. it was a silly kids movie that people of all ages will enjoy. we need more movies like this, shrek & Ice age.
B000AADYUI|5.0|Maybe you have to hear it in high school.  A preposterous plot, rather low fi sound in places, and long rambling lyrics will make this a tough listen for some.  But I love the playing and singing, particularly Jerry Garcia on various stringed instruments and the various bass players (Jack Casady, Harvey Brooks, and perhaps Phil Lesh play on the record).  Grace Slick sings beautifully as usual and David Crosby and even Graham Nash contribute vocals (and ideas).  There are many memorable lyrics as well. I get a pretty good buzz every time I listen to this.  Garcia and Slick came up with a very lovely ending to it, too.

0393061310|1.0|G, G, & S is pretentious but shallow and illustrates the corruption of too much of American academia where political correctness masquerades as objective scholarship.  It is as false as Lysenko's \\"biology.\\"   Diamond sets up a strawman, \\"biological differences,\\" and destroys him with his academic beanbags of dubious validity.     I won't recount all of this unfortunate book's deficiencies, as many reviewers have already done so in voluminous detail.  It is a strained and selective exposition of history in a vain attempt to support the author's preconceived opinions, i.e., that geography determines everything, which even casual observers would conclude is nonsense.  It completely ignores the roles of human creativity, innovation, energy, drive, and motivation.  To Diamond everything is predestined by geography.  This sounds vaguely religious, i.e., politically correct.       To Diamond, physics, engineering, and mathematics would have been developed in New Guinea, if not for what?  Who knows?     An alternative exposition on roughly the same topic is, \\"Carnage and Culture,\\" by Victor D. Hanson.  It displays vastly superior, i.e., objective scholarship.
0786838655|3.0|WARNING! SOME MILD SPOILERS BELOW!!            For me, \\"The Lightning Thief\\" wasn't too original. Plot wise, it takes many of the components of \\"Harry Potter\\" (Percy=Harry, Annabeth=Hermione, Grover=Ron, Chiron=Dumbledore, Clarisse= Draco, Camp Half Blood=Hogwarts, Kronos=Voldemort, etc), tossed with a bit of Neil Gaiman's \\"American Gods\\" (ie, the idea of mythological gods living in America in modern times, their world kind of hidden from mortal eyes). Anyone who has read Hamilton's \\"Mythology\\" or has a working knowledge of Greek mythology will recognize some of the characters long before it's revealed (it's pretty obvious who Percy's real dad is, for example). for kids new to Greek mythology, this book is a great introduction to some of these myths (it does a decent job of touching upon some of the lesser known ones, such as the story of Arachne and how Medusa was transformed).    There were some issues/annoyances I had with this book:    -the pace was rushed. I loved it was fast paced, but it was almost to fast paced. Percy seems to only be in camp for a few days; indeed the entire book takes place in the span of less than 2 weeks. I suppose kids like these ultra fast paced books, but it doesn't leave much time to know the other characters and so a lot of them turn out rather flat (Percy is by far the most well rounded character.)    -the know-it-all attitudes of the other campers are starting to aggravate me. They roll their eyes and laugh when Percy asks a question, as if he should somehow know this. This sets up a delayed explanation that is then delivered by Annabeth. it's evident in the next book as well and quite irritating after a while    -the actions of the characters are really silly, even for a YA fantasy book. the main trio fall into ridiculous, obvious traps, the villains are mostly inept, and in the end, a character basically commits murder (and this is handled in a nonchalant way).    -as an adult, I like reading young adult and children's books, but this is a book that just didn't appeal to me on an adult level. it was a bit too \\"cute\\" and simple. I can't really explain why I feel this way, but I've read other YA fantasy books that felt more adult than this book, more gritty and believable.    overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to a child since it is a great way of introducing them to mythology, but I just don't feel like this book lives up to other YA series like \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". \\"His Dark Materials\\", and of course \\"Harry Potter\\". the premise is interesting, and Percy is a fantastic and funny character/narrator, but that alone doesn't make up for the fairly weak plot, which is basically just a revolving door of characters from mythology (I'll be interested to see how this is kept out through a 4+ book series)
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Pros: Terrific HD experience, probably the best nature film produced  Cons: Every episode ends with a global warming lecture    \\"I thought this documetary was great when I first watched it on TV, but its absolutely stunning seeing it on High Def Blue Ray. There are a few scenes that will simply take your breath away and you will find yourself asking, \\"how in the world did they get this footage?\\" My jaw dropped and if it weren't a documentary, I'd think it was special affects when they captured the scene of seals swimming in the ocean (I don't to spoil it so i'll leave it at that). The makers claimed it took them 10 years in the making, and I believe them.    The only bad part is every episode ends with a little lecture on Global Warming, which is a bit annoying. Can't a person just enjoy a film without it getting political?\\"
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Well, I've heard this new CD for the first time all the way through and so far I have to honestly say it's different from the previous work and I like it. It's different enough to be interesting but there is still some of the old Coldpay there. So .. my final judgment is if you like Coldpay.. get this CD!!      Jeff
0743454529|1.0|I had high hopes for this book.  I thought it would be very interesting but the author dropped the ball completely.  I was surprised to find out later how well informed she was about this issue but shared nothing of this with her readers.  My overall opinion is that she was making stuff up as she went along. When she referred twice to a \\"plea bargain\\" in an emancipation case, I had to wonder if she had even the barest knowledge of family court. The fact that she rendered the entire law suit, the major conflict in the plot, pointless when she established early on that no organ transplant would or could ever take place from an unwilling donor made the whole book pointless as well. Then she feeds us a bunch of tripe about two angry, would-be lovers who snipe at each other the whole way through this boring book, I felt like I was reading a bodice  ripper from my grandmother's book shelf. The characters were under-developed, the plot underfed, the ending embarrassing.  Skip this book!

B001AIRUOU|5.0|Note: This is a review of the 2008 DVD release<br /><br />What's this? A new \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" DVD package? Actually there are three versions: this two-disc set that includes a downloadable digital copy, a [[ASIN:B001AIRUP4 Blu-ray]] version, and a [[ASIN:B001AIRUPE collector's edition]] that comes with a bust of Jack Skellington with a detachable Sandy Claus beard and hat.<br /><br />Though this version is billed as a two-disc set, it actually has three discs. The third one contains the digital copy. An instruction sheet spells out in clear steps how to download the file to an iPod or similar device.<br /><br />The movie itself is a feast for the eyes, ears and imagination. A delectable witches' brew of stop-motion animation, catchy show tunes and a seriously warped creative license, it always stays true to its timeless message: to be happy, be yourself. Devilishly nonconformist, it's an enduring holiday musical for the whole Addams family.<br /><br />Well, almost. Though all of its fright gags are played entirely for laughs, some of the imagery is downright creepy, especially for small children. Anyone older than say, 6, however, should enjoy every minute. Teenagers will love it.<br /><br />The story -- the citizens of Halloweentown attempt to annex neighboring Christmastown -- comes from the macabre mind of producer Tim Burton, who wrote it in his spare time (as a poem!) while working as a Disney animator in the 1980s. The movie blends the tastiest bits of Burton's earlier [[ASIN:B001AGXEAG Beetlejuice]] and [[ASIN:B00004U8P8 Edward Scissorhands]] with a sprinkling of the stop-motion magic first found in Disney's 1961 [[ASIN:B000065V3X Babes in Toyland.]]<br /><br />The imaginative cast of characters includes:<br />* Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), a mischievous misfit who believes his purpose in life is to merge the holidays of Halloween and Christmas.<br />* Jack's faithful dog Zero, a ghost with a glowing, jack-o'-lantern nose who, like the hound in [[ASIN:0375838473 How the Grinch Stole Christmas]], eventually pulls a sleigh<br />* Rag-doll heroine Sally (voiced by Catherine O'Hara), Jack's love interest, who sews herself back together when she loses a body part<br />* Oogie Boogie (Broadway veteran Ken Page), a slimy, singing bag of bugs who channels the cartoon version of Cab Calloway in the old [[ASIN:B0016HMA0Y Betty Boop]] cartoons<br />* Lock (Paul \\"Pee-Wee Herman\\" Reubens), Shock (O'Hara) and Barrel (Danny Elfman, the film's composer), a trio of evil trick-or-treaters who \\"kidnap the Sandy Claws\\"<br />* Wheelchair-bound evil scientist Dr. Finklestein (William Hickey), a duckbilled quack whose flip-top head lets him scratch his brains for inspiration<br />* A mayor (Glenn Shadix, the interior director Otho in [[ASIN:B001AGXEAG Beetlejuice]]) who is literally two-faced.<br /><br />Blessed with the ability to bring adult minds back to child's level, Burton dwells in dark mischief. In fact, some of Nightmare's best scenes include the kidnapping of Santa Claus and Jack's hilarious attempt to replace him on Christmas Eve, when the skeleton gleefully delivers presents such as tree-devouring snakes and severed, shrunken heads.<br /><br />Director Henry Selick painstakingly created the film over three years. Though he had a production crew of over 100, each minute of footage took a week, as each second required 24 ever-so-slightly different shots.<br /><br />BONUS FEATURES<br /><br />This 2-disc DVD package has a nice collection of extras:<br />* An audio commentary with Burton, Selick and Elfman.<br />* A downloadable digital copy of the film, which you can transfer to an iPod or similar device.<br />* Burton's first short, 1982's 6-minute \\"Vincent,\\" a black-and-white stop-action film about a boy who dreams of being Vincent Price, who narrates.<br />* Burton's 1994 Disney live-action short \\"Frankenweenie.\\" This 30-minute black-and-white film re-imagines the Frankenstein story as the tale of a young boy and his car-struck pet dog in suburban America. A recently taped introduction by Burton shows some working sketches being used for his full-length version now in development.<br />* A reading of Burton's original \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" poem by actor Christopher Lee<br />* A promotional film for the annual \\"Nightmare\\" makeover of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.<br />* Promotional and making-of featurettes, a storyboard to film comparison, deleted scenes and theatrical trailers and postersketches being used for his full-length version now in development.  * A reading of Burton's original \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" poem by actor Christopher Lee  * A promotional film for the annual \\"Nightmare\\" makeover of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.  * Promotional and making-of featurettes, a storyboard to film comparison, deleted scenes and theatrical trailers and posters

B0018AK9RA|3.0|I posted a review about this album before...and I am not quite sure if it ever hit the review pages. In some way, I may be glad it didn't. This album is, of course, a disappointment to the average Priest fan...or, average metal fan!  This album took almost 3 years to complete, and the time and hard-work sure do not go un-noticed.  The packaging, the art, and the almost 2 hours of music, really show the Priest had tried. So why only 3 stars?  Let me explain.    I am probably the biggest Judas Priest fan out there...these guys are metal, are art, are music...and I gave every album in their entire career a chance...and there was no loss of hope for me, when I heard about this concept record.  In many ways, I commend the band for choosing such a topic, and fulfilling their duties to create it. I did not rate this album low due to the orchestrations, choirs, goth elements, or anything that it contains...I rated it at 3 stars because of what it lacks. Most of the tracks on this album, lack the Priest sound.  Scott Travis, whom in my opinion is the fastest drummer of all time, does not get to use much of his double-bass technique, to form the intensive speed-metal sound they earned since the 70's. Once they picked Travis up in '89, things got a lot heavier...and that sound had stuck with them until this release.     Certain songs contain decent elements that make for good listening, but in order to hear the only few good elements, you must listen through an entire song, to find only a few seconds that really catch your attention. This album, however, contains three hard rocking songs that may be some of the best work Priest ever done! That is why I gave it 3 stars instead of one.  The opening intro, \\"Dawn of Creation\\" takes you on a dark voyage, until \\"Prophecy\\" comes in to kick you in the teeth.  This song gets very catchy, and the metal-like, but yet very melodic, solo is definitely something to hear! The rest of disc one seems very bland, and way to calm for the Priestsound,  until we reach \\"Persecution\\". This song begins with Scott's insanely fast double-bass drumming, with huge rolls, showing the world, it was not his idea to slow things down. K.K. and Glenn's guitars are extremely heavy here, which makes this song very menacing and powerful.  Once disc 2 hit's the cd player, it even gets worse. \\"Alone\\" is quite a nice song, and has a good feel for a ballad kind of track, but still doesn't work to well for the mighty Priest. Once \\"Calm Before the Storm\\" comes on, you know something is ready to come at you, like an axe to the forehead. The well operatic intro to a very strong metal title track, \\"Nostradamus\\", explains while Halford is still going strong at his age. His vocals are quite pleasing here, and very surprising, until his trademark scream, mixed with machine gun drumming and palm muting riffs, shows that the Priest can still blow your speakers!  The ending of the concept \\"Future of Mankind\\" has its good moments, but leave the listener feeling disappointed.     The packaging, obviously, took a lot of time and thought, which in my mind...paid off well.  After hearing they were going to produce the album themselves, I got kind of excited. I was expecting the quality of \\"Jugulator\\" and \\"Demolition\\" (which, in my opinion, are amazing albums...some of the best I've ever heard) (Good ol' Tim `Ripper' Owens\\"), which was a total let down. The quality on this album is not that great. In the song \\"Nostradamus\\", you have to force your ears to pick up Travis's bass drum, which he smashes out well in that track. Even K.K. and Glenn's guitars do not sound brutal, like their earlier work. We can just hope \\"Metal-Gods\\" return with an album to knock our socks off in a few years...to remind us all, why they earned that title in the first place. Until then, check them out with other amazing bands on the metal-masters tour (Heaven & Hell, Motorhead, and Testament)...and pick up Halford's solo album, \\"Halford IV\\", when that gets the chance to hit the shelves. Until then...long live Priest!!!    \\"Here they come! These Gods of steel!\\"
B0018OAPAW|5.0|Everyone knows that 'Smash' is The Offspring's best album.  That vote is unanimous, so I'm not okay with making comparisons to that record because it was epic.  I mean, the album holds the world record for most copies sold on an indie label.  You come across a punk record like that once a decade, at the most.  It was the 'American Idiot' of the 90's, in other words.  So if we can agree on that, we don't have to put 'Rise And Fall, Rage And Grace' up against the impossible.  That's a steep hill to climb and it'll just lead to a cliff.<br /><br />It's been 4 ½ years since the Orange County punkers dropped an LP and as much as I wanted to like 'Splinter', it was considerably short, lacking substance on some levels and not as catchy as we've become accustomed to.  I wasn't about to throw in the towel on my favorite band, and they rewarded my patience with 'RFRG.'  The Offspring has come alive again with a darker album that focuses more on domestic and global issues than ever before.  They've once again expanded upon their musical prowess, implementing the piano into one of their songs, a sound the fan base has never previously heard from the band.  I think this is probably the most well rounded album The Offspring has produced in at least a decade.  It's an outlet of emotions, a release of stress and a huge step out of the shadows and back into the spotlight.  It's the past and the present, it's everything you'd expect and nothing you'd expect.  It's Dexter Holland at his absolute peak and Noodles breaking out some of his best guitar work.  It's a band that came into the studio with something to prove and an idea of what they wanted to do.  They delivered like the Offspring we've come to know and love over the years.<br /><br />1) Half-truism:  9.5/10 - This is how you put your best foot forward.  If you want vintage, this is vintage.  This song is the fast paced, lyrically savvy piece with the background vocals and the chorus that sticks to your head.  This will be a popular track with the fans because it's what reminds them of the band's rise to fame.<br />2) Trust In You:  9/10 - You have to know the song on 'Smash' called \\"I'm Not The One.\\"  You may have a flashback when you first hear the lyrics \\"I  AM the one...\\"  This track is about the bridge, in my opinion though.  Noodles' guitar solo is absolutely awesome, probably accounting for my favorite moment of the album.<br />3) You're Gonna Go Far, Kid:  9.5/10 - I'd be surprised if you didn't hear this song on the radio in a couple months.  It's probably the catchiest song on the disc as a whole and gives way to one of the more funny/interesting lines on 'RFRG', 'Dance, f***er, dance.'<br />4) Hammerhead:  10/10 - A lead single about a school shooting?  Definitely a change of pace from \\"Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)\\", \\"Original Prankster\\", \\"Hit That\\" ...  But a brilliant tone setter for the album, this song front to back gave me chills.  If you ask me, it's their most powerful single ever, polished beautifully on all cylinders and for lack of a better word, moving.<br />5) A Lot Like Me:  10/10 - No mistake, you heard a piano.  I gave this song a ten for its originality, much less the absolute face melting singing from Dexter Holland.  If I had to make a comparison, I'd say this track is most closely related to \\"Denial, Revisited\\" from 'Conspiracy of One', but even that's a stretch.  I've already said this song isn't getting the credit it deserves on forums and myspace, so give it a listen and see what you think.<br />6) Takes Me Nowhere:  9/10 - This is a very generic track for the band, not overly catchy nor memorable, but nonetheless a solid song.  This is a track I have to pay my dues to Greg K for the work on the bass.  He's a forgotten soul in a band dominated on the front line.<br />7) Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?:  8/10 - This is the only song I'm not sure where to place.  I may be completely off track because I don't really know what the song's about, but this song didn't have a place on the album.  At the very least, just by the title of the song, you can rule out anything that's going into your Offspring time capsule.  Personally, I don't dislike the song, but for a fan like myself, a neutral feeling is as good as saying you don't like it.  However, I could be the crazy one here, you never know.<br />8) Nothingtown:  9/10 - This is another track that'll go overlooked.  I absolutely love the job Noodles did on the guitars with this song.  It actually gives the melody a bit of a \\"She's Got Issues\\" feel to it.  You know how they say an album grows on you?  For me, it applies to this song more than any other.  It gets better every time I listen to it.<br />9) Stuff Is Messed Up:  9.5/10 - This is, hands down, the ring tone song of the album.  I can't even say much more about it.  If I had read the lyrics and had to identify the artist, really, only these guys.  It has serious intentions and more substance behind it than most of the band's previous songs of its kind, but I can't help laughing.  I'd love to hear Dexter sing the bridge in concert.<br />10) Fix Me:  9.5/10 - I probably won't be the first, nor the only person you'll hear this from, but if you've heard \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", as probably all of you have, this song will sound eerily similar in parts.  Don't get me wrong, though.  This is one of my favorite songs on the album and for good reason.  It's a slow song and a very different song from anything you've heard before.  In fact, I can say with confidence that this track will come under criticism for being too pop, too soft and nothing like your typical Offspring.  Throw the allegations aside and just enjoy the needle in the haystack.<br />11) Let's Hear It For Rock Bottom:  8.5/10 - The song strangely sounds like something Vendetta Red would write.  However, I'm not complaining.  Rightfully so, this won't be one of the more talked about songs on the album, but it's definitely not going to fall under the category of filler.<br />12) Rise And Fall:  9.5/10 - I actually love this song.  It's nothing special, it's nothing too catchy or creative, but it's just this band at their best.  I fell in love with the chorus from the get go and haven't gotten tired of it yet.  The Offspring always seem to come through with their title tracks, and though 'Americana' and 'Smash' take the gold and silver, this song is not trailing by a great distance.<br /><br />You may come across a song, even a lyric here and there that may remind you of The Offspring's prior work or a song they didn't even write, but that's what music is all about.  It's taking an idea and tweaking/tampering with it until you perfect it.  What's so brilliant about this album is that the band gives you a dose of what won over your allegiance in the first place without sacrificing the originality of the music.  Those are the albums that thrive in the music business.  I don't understand the viewpoint of some people...  they chastise you for experimenting with a new style/sound, but if you stay on an even keel, you're critiqued for recycling and reproducing the same music (Pennywise has often been victimized by that type of criticism).<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this album to both the casual Offspring fan and the die hard fan.  It was a fantastic effort and well worth the wait.  Pick up the CD and keep supporting the group!<br /><br />Grade: A-/Aery least, just by the title of the song, you can rule out anything that's going into your Offspring time capsule.  Personally, I don't dislike the song, but for a fan like myself, a neutral feeling is as good as saying you don't like it.  However, I could be the crazy one here, you never know.  8) Nothingtown:  9/10 - This is another track that'll go overlooked.  I absolutely love the job Noodles did on the guitars with this song.  It actually gives the melody a bit of a \\"She's Got Issues\\" feel to it.  You know how they say an album grows on you?  For me, it applies to this song more than any other.  It gets better every time I listen to it.  9) Stuff Is Messed Up:  9.5/10 - This is, hands down, the ring tone song of the album.  I can't even say much more about it.  If I had read the lyrics and had to identify the artist, really, only these guys.  It has serious intentions and more substance behind it than most of the band's previous songs of its kind, but I can't help laughing.  I'd love to hear Dexter sing the bridge in concert.  10) Fix Me:  9.5/10 - I probably won't be the first, nor the only person you'll hear this from, but if you've heard \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", as probably all of you have, this song will sound eerily similar in parts.  Don't get me wrong, though.  This is one of my favorite songs on the album and for good reason.  It's a slow song and a very different song from anything you've heard before.  In fact, I can say with confidence that this track will come under criticism for being too pop, too soft and nothing like your typical Offspring.  Throw the allegations aside and just enjoy the needle in the haystack.  11) Let's Hear It For Rock Bottom:  8.5/10 - The song strangely sounds like something Vendetta Red would write.  However, I'm not complaining.  Rightfully so, this won't be one of the more talked about songs on the album, but it's definitely not going to fall under the category of filler.  12) Rise And Fall:  9.5/10 - I actuallylove this song.  It's nothing special, it's nothing too catchy or creative, but it's just this band at their best.  I fell in love with the chorus from the get go and haven't gotten tired of it yet.  The Offspring always seem to come through with their title tracks, and though 'Americana' and 'Smash' take the gold and silver, this song is not trailing by a great distance.    You may come across a song, even a lyric here and there that may remind you of The Offspring's prior work or a song they didn't even write, but that's what music is all about.  It's taking an idea and tweaking/tampering with it until you perfect it.  What's so brilliant about this album is that the band gives you a dose of what won over your allegiance in the first place without sacrificing the originality of the music.  Those are the albums that thrive in the music business.  I don't understand the viewpoint of some people...  they chastise you for experimenting with a new style/sound, but if you stay on an even keel, you're critiqued for recycling and reproducing the same music (Pennywise has often been victimized by that type of criticism).    I'd highly recommend this album to both the casual Offspring fan and the die hard fan.  It was a fantastic effort and well worth the wait.  Pick up the CD and keep supporting the group!    Grade: A-/A
B0018OAPAW|3.0|When I first listened to this album, I was not at all satisfied.  What through me off was the ballad type songs that totally places your mind into something that My Chemical Romance would create. The best thing about the Offspring is their talent to be original, and make powerful music with a message.  \\"Half-truism\\" is an incredible melodic, yet powerful song, that seems to let off where \\"Splinter\\" ended. \\"Trust In You\\", I feel, is the best song on this album. It has the sound of something off of \\"Smash\\" or \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\".  \\"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\\" is a little different from the normal work of the Offspring. If I had to compare that song to any of their earlier pieces, I'd have to say \\"Hit That\\"...however, it is a very catchy song. \\"Hammerhead\\" is very powerful, and ultimately heavier than what we are used to on an Offspring album. It changes paces and riffs almost as much as old Metallica! Although, the riff in the middle of the song is a straight rip of The Kinks...it still is a great rocker. \\"Takes Me Nowhere\\" still has a great powerful, melodic punk tone that will make you think they never finished the \\"Smash\\" album yet.  Now...here is where the album falls quickly down hill...\\"Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?\\" and \\"Fix You\\", are half-thrown together ballads that eliminate everything The Offspring stood for, and would make you think they were going for the new-age punk/emo scene.   \\"Nothingtown\\" is neither good or bad, and \\"Stuff Is Messed Up\\" is just all together funny and pointless at the same time.  The last two tracks of the album feel as if they were ripping off Green Day's, \\"American Idiot\\"...especially \\"Rise & Fall\\".  Ultimately, it is a decent album, but it takes a lot of time to grow on you.  It is worth some time, so don't ignore it after the first listen. I am a total metalhead, but I always loved the Offsprings work.
0316143472|2.0|I call this a \\"cult book\\" because you must be a fan of David Sedaris to appreciate the stories and the humor.  I never read Sedaris before.  I found his writing to be rambling at times and straining at humor at other times.  I knew the book was destined for a box in my basement when I awoke this morning to the sounds of my dog chewing up the dust cover.<br />I am glad, however, that so many others enjoyed this book.  Hopefully their dust covers are intact.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|I fling myself firmly onto the side of the fence with those that were somewhat shocked and surprised by the newest Judas Priest release Nostradamus but nonetheless blown away by the magnificence of this effort. As all performers mature, so should their music and JP is proving to be no different. This release speaks volumes to their creativity and I for one think it's about time they thought outside of the box and expanded their range. IMHO, there's plenty of guitars and full-on rockers but it's mixed with a grandiose assortment of power from all angles...keyboard majestry, symphonic interludes and of course, the over-the-top vocal prowess of Rob Halford.    My first listen to this (self-incrimination to follow) was from a borrowed bit-torrent download and at first, I thought I may have been fooled by my friend and given a local band or some obscure Brit prog-metal effort but it didn't take long to realize that only Halford sings that way...it was pure Judas Priest but in a form I wasn't quite ready to mind-meld with. It didn't take long however to become assimilated. Standout cuts to me so far are the title track Nostradamus and Alone...I'm sure more will follow.    Open your mind, don't listen to the naysayers.....get this release! I think I'm going to pick up the vinyl versions just to get that old school feeling again.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|Let me just start by saying that I am a huge Gilmore Girls fan and have seen just about every episode numerous times. Something about season seven just seems off, I don't know what it is. It could be that it was weird for me to see Lorelai married, she just seems like she is better off single. Most of the storylines this season are good, but some just don't sit well with me. I guess I just don't like David Rosenthal's storylines and ideas as much as Amy Sherman-Palladino's. Season seven does have its moments, but some of the other seasons are funnier or have better storylines, or both. If you have to know what happened, you should get season seven. And if you're a huge Gilmore Girls fan you should be able to look past the flaws that you may find in this season.

076790592X|4.0|As a class we read the book Tuesday with Morrie by Mitch Albom. Tuesdays with Morrie is an incredible novel about a professor who becomes very ill and happens to connect with Mitch Albom an old student of Morrie's when Mitch found out Morrie was ill. Mitch is an average working man who is very involved with his work and gets wrapped up in things that dont really matter in life.  In this book you learn a lot about yourself and the courage and bravery behind death. By reading this book you realize what matters in life and how important family and friends actually are. Its not about money and the nicest cars its about love and happiness. After reading this book I had a whole new outlook on life. Also you begin to notice what happens now wont effect you in the future.   I suggest this book for anybody who is looking for a good read, or anybody that needs that extra push when they are in a time of need. This book opens up a lot of doors for many different people and I hope that this book has the same affect on people as it did on me.  Enjoy :)

0385340567|5.0|Nothing to Lose (NTL) takes an old theme and revamps it into a modern masterpiece. It's very similar to the original Rambo movie, where an ex-military specialist finds himself wandering into a small town, is picked up by the local sheriff and escorted to the town line and told that drifters aren't welcome; of course Rambo returns to town and blows everything up. In NTL Reacher is treated similarly and eventually gets even, but where it differs; it allows the author the opportunity to share his opinions on the Iraq war, born again fundamentalist Christians and the modern military. Its a bold step to take seeing that many of Lee Child's fans are ex or current military and hold the opposite opinion on the war.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|I have to be honest. The first time I listened to this album I was a bit disappointed because it was something new to me being a Priest fan and I was expecting something similar to Painkiller or Screaming for Vengeance. But Don't get me wrong, after listening to it a few more times, I started to get hooked!<br /><br />This album is so good that I regret complaining about it the first time. I had to go and buy this baby so I got the deluxe edition. It's like a little book and it's very well designed. It has a little introduction by the band, and then in each lyric page it has like a drawing based on each song.<br /><br />Now don't get confused with the number of songs. The actual number of songs is 14. That fooled me at first. So I'm glad I decided to buy Nostradamus. I feel like doing some research on the guy now and find out more about him. Oh and by the way the lyrics are masterpieces.

B000001FS3|2.0|There are two glaringly obvious affectations to blame for the artistic failure of U2's 'the Joshua Tree': One is the record company, who MUST for the sake of their shareholders, send young provincial bands to the colonies and the huge rewards from the eager masses there..<br />The other is the Clash.<br /><br />'London Calling' sent U2, and any number of other groups from the UK and beyond, scuttling for their cowboy boots and neckerchiefs in the mistaken belief that they could take-on-American-influences-and-still-be-interesting....not so.<br /><br />If you give young people in their 20's lots of cash and put them on a plane to the heart of consumerism, they're gonna imbibe...and how.<br />Within weeks, they're adopting that ridiculous gait all rock groups must adopt when they're 'conquering' America; wearing leather vests; riding the subway, and plundering the not insubstantial culture to arrive at the (paid minions encouraged) conclusion that they are Guthrie, Kerouac and Dylan rolled into one.<br />This can only result in one thing - the recording of the 'American' rock album.<br /><br />In the case of a group like U2, the American Rock Album is a laughable betrayal. A suspicious dirge of such ropiness and lack of character that it becomes a danger to itself and others. A concept so crass and the results so boring that one must wonder if it's all part of the record company's (I suspect) anti-young agenda anyway: \\"We hate the young, let's go out of our way not to understand them, and pointedly send them off in the wrong direction.\\"<br /><br />So, Bono and Co, well stocked up on the clich&eacute;'s, and even though they're from leafy avenue Dublin, don't find it at all embarrassing to sing about \\"red orange glows\\" and \\"fighters over mud-huts\\" (!)<br />Well it is. Very.<br /><br />Take 'Bullet the Blue Sky', an AWFUL song in the worst sense. Bono thinks he's being all passionate and powerful, but in reality he's fallen head first into the ditch of tunelessness and got himself bogged down in the slurry-pit of unforgivably hideous pretention.<br />Lyrics with no substance accompany sour one-note feedback-guitar playing. Worse, he seems to be singing in a funny accent. He's not from Brooklyn (or Nashville for that matter!) he's from Ireland.<br />To hear him drawl \\"into the arms of Amurca..\\" and reciting some of the worst poetry you'll hear: \\"rose on a thorn bush, like the colours of a Royal Flush, and he's peeling off those dollar bills, slappin' 'em down..100...200\\" and worse: \\"take the staircase to the first floor, turn the key and slowly unlock the door.. A guy breathes into his saxophone, and through the walls you can hear the city groan...outside it's Amurca\\" is so bad that it can actually pull you up short. Sharp intake of breath and all that. To some-one who adored the likes of 'Boy' and 'October,' it's quite hard to take.<br /><br />Apart from the singles (too obvious, obviously), 'Red Hill Mining Town' is passable but spoiled by more rotten poetry and commonplace rising orchestra; and there is one good song(!) - 'One Tree Hill'.<br />Here, U2 forego all the faux-rockism to a degree and deliver a minimal, jaunty, calypso-led number. It still has some of the (deliberate) dirge-style quality of the rest of the album but it seems there is genuine soul at work, trying to break free of the creative constraints and narrowness.<br />Up to a point it succeeds, until its effect is bludgeoned to a pulp by 'Exit' - a worthless ballad trying to invoke the spirit of 'Combat Rock's - Death is a Star', but failing miserably.<br /><br />I had to laugh at 'Running to Stand Still', where Bono meaningfully intones \\"Halal, halal, halal ..today\\" (That'd be all we need, Bono in the Islam corner!) over a music operating at no level of competence above that of the worst 70's campus commandos, before letting rip with more yodelling and angst. Then, just to ram the whole farcical context home, a Dylan-style harmonica comes in, serving just one purpose only...further attempted authenticity.<br />But by now it's not even consolation.<br /><br />The rest of 'The Joshua Tree' ploughs a pedestrian and unoriginal rock furrow. Very quickly the listener becomes bored with gospel backing singers (an abomination in rock terms) and long, purposeless passages of egotistical, neurotic verse and sludgy, murky geetar; gets more and more irritated at Bono's 'soulful' posturing and screaming; becomes homicidal at yet more \\"faces frozen against the wind\\" and \\"red desert skies\\" (I didn't know there were deserts in Contae Bhaile Atha Cliath, Paul. You live and learn).<br /><br />'The Joshua Tree' isn't a surprise, and that's the biggest problem with it. It doesn't need a genius to predict that the US would have this kind of influence on U2 and that this was the only album that could result. People spend lifetimes making sense of this massive culture and only scratch the surface, U2 think they can do it after a couple albums and a tour. Dazed and daunted before their time is the inevitable result.<br /><br />'The Joshua Tree' is the sound of rock eating its young alive.st of 'The Joshua Tree' ploughs a pedestrian and unoriginal rock furrow.

0060558121|5.0|Let me say that I have read most of Neil Gaiman's work, including of course The Sandman series.<br /><br />This is really a fabulous book.  It takes the reader a couple of dozen pages before realizing that the protagonist is in the company of real Gods.  Death is an abstract concept here.  The dead have a way of revisiting and changing the plot in unexpected ways.<br /><br />I wish this could be a movie, but I don't know how that would be possible.  This is a book to read and reread.  Highly recommended.  If you have read this far, you need this book, trust me...

0143038419|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is a phenomenal author. She can talk about very mundane things and somehow they sound interesting. That is pretty much this book in a nutshell. Typically the person who's traveled is much more interested in their stories than the people listening. Especially when you name-drop cities no one else has been to. It takes a skilled storyteller to describe unknown places and make us care, which the author skillfully does. She tells funny, meaningful, and interesting tales that each relate to her ultimate goal in traveling- to find out more about herself and become more comfortable in her own skin. It's a memoir for sure, but a spiritual life journey we can embark on with her without getting bored.

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|I really wasn't expecting too much from this film, but I do admit that the premise intrigued me. I had not read the original novel that the film was based on, so I cannot rate how well the film adapted the book.    First off, let's talk about the real star of this movie; the special effects. They are quite good, although nothing we haven't seen before (remember the first time you saw the original Star Wars and Jurassic Park? - Wow!). Of course the film relies heavily on CGI and I'm sure green screen was extensively used, although I couldn't tell what was real and what was green screen (I can usually tell).    Second, I really liked the idea behind the whole story of the Jumpers and the Paladins. With such an interesting idea, one would have expected the story to go a little further than it did and delve deeper into the origins of both sides of the \\"war\\", but I got the feeling that this was just an \\"introductory film\\" that would lead to numerous sequels (it's Hollywood - what did you expect?). The film does indeed, leave the story WIDE open for sequels galore.    Finally, the acting was substandard in my opinion. I did like the Star Wars prequel films, but I never did like Hayden Christensen's performances. They were wooden, dull, and just plain uninteresting. The same goes for \\"Jumper\\". He is a good-looking and resonably fit individual and I'm sure that appeals to the young ladies and gives them incentive to go to the theaters, but his acting skills are just plain awful. He just doesn't have the acting skills to carry a lead role.    Racheal Bilson's (sorry if I spelled her name incorrectly) performance is just as bad as Christiansen's. Both actors deliver shallow performances and portray shallow characters. Sam Jackson was as good as he could be with the role he was given, but overall, I just wasn't able to establish an emotional connection with them and therefore really didn't care how things turned out for them.    To sum up, the story and special effects are pretty decent and will keep you entertained for a couple fo hours, but don't expect any riveting performances or thought-provoking commentary about the human condition. This movie is just a popcorn flick, but sometimes those kinds of movies can be fun.    This one is.

B0018AK9RK|5.0|I'll start by saying that this CD will generate some negative reviews. I expect this because there will be many Priest fans looking for hits and pure headbanging classics. Not the case here. This project contains too much diversity in mood and use of multiple music styles and it won't satisfy those in it for a quick Priest fix. Buy Painkiller instead and rock on.  That all said, even I needed a few listens to put the flow of this record into my head. I'm not a classical music fan, but I love it when used in interludes and as an accompaniment to music I really love such as heavy metal. Priest make that fuson work here, but one must see this record as a journey rather than waiting for particular tracks. It is quite grandiose really daring the listener to experience and take it in fully and with patience. I would say its quite Meat Loaf or Queen-style grandiose fused with the Epic elements of say an Iced Earth. Robs vocals are excellent and at times spectacular. Some may bemoan the dominance of mid tempo range vocals, but I think at his age, with a tour in mind, its a remarkable achievement. What Rob gives you is quality not quantity for obvious reasons.  While there are plenty of typical Priest-style riffs to indulge in, they do not dominate this album. JP wanted to do something different here, so while the flashes of Priest brilliance dot this record, its not all what its about.  Overall though, extremely satisfying and a wonderful quality piece of work. Standout tracks include the post Ozzy Black Sabbath-style \\"Death\\", \\"War\\", \\"Persecution\\" and \\"Nostradamus\\". Some of the classical interludes I really love are \\"The Four Horseman\\" and \\"Peace\\".  4.5 stars

B001AACEP8|4.0|My impressions of Katy Perry were pretty much limited to the release of her previous singles of \\"Ur So Gay\\" and \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" before listening to this album.  If going by the measure of those singles alone, I would have likely labeled her in the progressions of artists like Madonna or Cyndi Lauper, producing fun, upbeat catchy power pop melodies but having little personal impact.      Yet, if you look a little deeper into \\"One of the Boys\\" as an overall album, you see she goes beyond and intentionally crafts the album as one that's distinctly tongue in cheek, taking influences from artists like Alanis Morissette or perhaps even Fiona Apple.  Is she as strong as the  aforementioned artists? Difficult to say, but the album on the overall spectrum provides an interesting listen for a debut. I found it interesting that she also cites Paul Simon and Queen as influences on her musical style overall.    The title track begins the album on an upbeat melodic note, with a rebellious tonal bite. It expresses a tear between sexual identity stereotypes that sounds more genuine than, but in the same progressive stance as \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" (which conveniently follows the first track).  \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" is undeniably catchy, both in its easily recognizable chorus and melody, but only takes root in its true meaning in the progression of the album. It still feels lacking compared to some of the other stronger tracks on the album.  \\"Waking Up in Vegas\\" is a nice change in tonality, an expression of escapism through a nice rock progression. I liked the track far more than I thought I would (I'd name it among the best the album has to offer), noting the power in her vocals when not covered by lavish synthesizers. I don't know if it differs too much than other songs with similar textures, but it's a nice change of pace for the album.    \\"Thinking of You\\" is strong in its lyrical construction, with a good, raw emotional feel regarding a strained relationship; it's one of the strongest examples of Perry's cited influence of Alanis Morissette. It features a pretty much cut and dry indie feel, but I don't know if it stood out distinctly to really connect with me fully. \\"Mannequin\\" I liked in the same progression as \\"Waking Up in Vegas\\", she really carries the emotion best in this song, full of bitterness and sporting some of her strongest vocals on the album.  \\"UR so Gay\\" seems to be another distinctly impacting song in its overall note of controversy, very tongue in cheek and controversial, like that of \\"I Kissed A Girl\\", but has a little more tangibility because the underlying message communicates a frustration with a relationship. Strong sexual assertions here, and you can either take it as hilarious and pressing the bar or a progression of misguided stereotypes, or even somewhere between the two.  \\"Hot 'N Cold\\" returns to the distinct power pop style of the opening of the album.  Easily singable, catchy and memorable in that progression, and her personality comes through without being too oversteeped in its \\"impact for shock\\" value (something I found a problem in both singles for \\"Ur So Gay\\" and \\"I Kissed a Girl\\").    I enjoyed \\"If You Can Afford Me\\": it never feels overdone and manages to be moderately catchy, good vocal and overall tonality, but while it makes an easy listen, it doesn't quite stand out as distinct from the album on an overall note. \\"Lost\\" is a genuine track with a calm, solemn feel. It's one of my favorites on the album because she actually seems like she feels the emotions radiated from the song, and allows it to come through her vocal as well.  It's not lyrically complicated, nor overshadowed by any external elements - which makes it work all the better.  I liked \\"Self-Inflicted\\" for its moderate indie rock tonality and message, decent track, but didn't so much stand out as strongly as a few of the other tracks on the album.  \\"I'm Still Breathing\\" seems a stark contrast to the rest of the album, because it looks at a crushed relationship and the speaker takes on a suicidal mentality in ironic context - again not the strongest song for me personally, but I think it can find a point to connect with others.  \\"Fingerprints\\" seems to wrap up the album with everything right: catchy, clear meaning in its message, and retains enough bite to let you know who Katy Perry is as an artist. And who is she? someone who definitely doesn't mind pushing the envelope a bit, radiating bitterness in the scheme of conflicting relationships.    Overall, I think she definitely has potential to grow as an artist and appeal to those in current music.  Would I remember this album in a few years?  Not as readily, it's enjoyable with a few hits and misses in its wake, but I'd recommend giving it a go and seeing what you can take from the album. It's not always my cup of tea, but I found it worth the time.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|this is a great cd for the money.with brian eno producing this it sounds a lot like u2 in places but since i like u2 that is a good thing for me. with money getting tighter for us poor folks i have to be a little more discerning in what music i actually buy and this disc is one that i did buy with no hesitation after listening to samples and some videos. every band has influences that tend to show in their music so i have no problem with this cd sounding like this or that. give it a chance!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|This CD was very unusual for Judas Priest. These guys are old legends and shouldn't want to progress their sound, but they did! Nostradamus sounds old school with some progressive new school power metal concepts. There are plenty of great guitar leads from KK and Glenn.     The great songs are Prophecy, revelations, death, plague, persecution, exiled, and alone.     The good songs are Nostradamus, conquest, and Future of mankind.     The interludes are average and not very important.     The lame songs are lost love, new beginnings, war, and visions.     If you are looking for the operatic defenders of the faith style classic metal you will like this! If you like fast and heavy like Painkiller or Jugulator you could be disappointed. Yes, the ballads are terrible.    The songs have strong gothic type keyboards, epic sound effects, and galloping bass lines that sound pretty awesome.  Rob Halford sings in Italian in the song plague. Nostradamus as a whole is diverse and progressive rock-metal, this is NOT brutal thrash or speed metal.  Each song is about as heavy as the painkiller era songs but nothing is very fast. Think of Iron Maiden's 7th son and Pink Floyd The Wall meets Judas Priest's Angel Of Retribution meets The phantom of the opera and you've got Nostradamus.  A great cd.     Very interesting and good music. Check it out! If somebody says this sucks then please listen to this CD a few times on a good sound system and then compare it to Metallica's St. Anger. This is really cool music.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|I think all these reviews about how this \\"isn't country\\" are ridiculous.  What defines \\"country\\" in this day and age?  This is MUSIC, sung with perhaps the purest, southern-tinged voice in all of music.  The songs are simple, down-home arrangements, with a touch of folk and blues.  But that voice...that voice just carries them.    Another great Emmylou album.
B000YABYLA|3.0|Juno is a film which tackles the issue of teenage pregnancy. Once teenager Juno discovers she is pregnant, she immediately tries to figure out what to do. Does she try to have an abortion, or does she keep it? Or does she give it up for adoption? The story revolves about her emotions in dealing with her pregnancy and bringing a life into the world. She tells her best friends, and seeks advice, and once she decides to give it away for adoption, meets the couple and tries to figure out if they will be the right parents for her child. While the film has heart at times, and good morals at times, over all the story's dialogue seems artificial and forced, and it seems to waver between wanting to be a drama and a comedy, and successfully being neither.     Personally, the story wasn't very gripping or interesting, and part of this is due to lack of believability. Most films do not have to be realistic because they are solely based on entertaining, but if you are going to make a film about a serious issue like teen pregnancy or abortion then at least make it somewhat authentic.  Many scenes are understated, and you have to second guess whether this is how parents would really react. Consider the scene where Juno first tells her father and mother-in-law that she is pregnant. To use a word that Juno uses herself, her parents were way too \\"cavalier\\" about her news and her decision to have an abortion, not being riled up in the slightest and seemingly giving her the \\"OK\\" for it. Not only that, but she can even go to the abortion clinic alone.  Also, the scenes with Juno and her friend Paulie are way too lackadaisical, and the idea of Juno actually falling for someone who is her polar opposite and has no chemistry with is a bit ludicrous. (If so, why wasn't there any chemistry built between them in the film?)  I found Juno's character to be somewhat unbelievable as well; she has some elements of being a teenager with her smart aleck attitude and witticisms, but then she goes around being worldly and sophisticated also.     The cute, hip dialogue gets little tiresome after awhile as well. Juno seems to be a film screaming \\"Look how indie and hip I am!\\"     True, Juno's being up for last year's Best Picture really set the bar for expectations. Perhaps the public ate it up. (However, this award rarely is given to exceptional films anymore).  I watched Juno once, and once is enough. It's not horrible, but there is nothing that makes it exceptional either.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|This alblum is nowhere near the standard of music we are used to hearing from Coldplay.  I'm a huge fan, and own all their other alblums, but this one was horrible.  Its a good thing I listened to it via an online jukebox before purchasing the tracks.  Other than Violet Hill, the rest of the cd is forgettable.  I'm very disappointed because I was really looking forward to this cd.  I don't know why they felt the need to change up their sound so much.  As a musician, I understand wanting to explore new things and not continue to put out the same stuff all the time, but they really took a risk with this alblum, and its not going to pay off.    If I had bought the alblum I would feel cheated... now I just feel very disappointed.
0525950079|4.0|If you are looking for a good book to take on a trip, WWE and Pillars of the Earth, are good choices.  Neither book is true historical fiction, the language is not necessarily true to the times, and sometimes the books just kind of drift along (especially WWE), but both fit squarely in the \\"good read, not memorable\\" category & I recommend them to everyone.  Check them out from your library if you don't want to commit to a purchase.
0061537934|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  Well-written, lyrical, and engaging.  I totally enjoyed it.  Actually re-read several passages, savoring the writing.  One of the best books I've read this year.  Enzo gives me hope.  Denny is a champion, in more ways than one.
0679746048|4.0|\\"Girl, Interrupted\\", probably known better by the film adaptation, is a memoir of a woman recounting the two years she spent in a mental institution in the 1960s when she was a teenager.  Some liken it to a \\"One Flew Over The  Cuckoo's Nest\\" but from a woman's perspective.  But this analogy doesn't work for me.  Firstly, the institution in question is not some barbaric hell hole.  While decidedly not a country club, it is an institution for the mentally disturbed with lots of financial backing.  Secondly, \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" is a memoir, not a novel.  The author recounts everything from her perspective, and therefore delves heavily into introspection ... perhaps a bit too much.  Ultimately all the self-analysis, especially when taken from the longer view many years after leaving the institution, grows tiresome.  In the end I really didn't know if the author deserved to be institutionalized and, sadly, I sort of didn't care.  Royalties from this book and the film probably helped ease the rotten memories of her lost two teenage years.      Bottom line: while very readable and often thought-provoking, I think this book might be of most interest to those involved/interested in psychiatric care.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|Intolerant metal fans will no doubt slag this double CD for its keyboards and overall melody that metal bands simply aren't doing these days.  Their loss.<br />  We must remember that Glenn Tipton released a fine solo effort with John Entwhistle and Cozy Powell a few years back that was more melodic than Priest material was.  These guys have been around too long to be expected to just repeat themselves over and over.  With the experience and musicianship present, \\"Nostradamus\\" gives us a metal CD that offers the best vocalist in the genre ever, Rob Halford, instead of the extremely annoying grunt metal that permeates everything else.  One hopes that this CD will be a hit, and will maybe encourage metal outfits out there to not be afraid to actually sing a little bit.<br />  There's plenty of signature lead work and slicing guitars, but also lots of keyboards, which are necessary for the subject matter and add color and dimension to the music.  Lyrically, it's basically a history of the great prophet, which one can take or leave, but overall I find it refreshing to see these metal godfathers stretch their wings whether some lunkhead likes it or not.
B000V7FZ7U|5.0|It's simply the greatest live performances of the Simply Red.  Love all the songs.  I have seem their live in San Diego few years back.  It was fantastic.

1596912863|1.0|Jane is a thirty-three-year-old graphics designer from New York City with an obsession for BBC's Pride & Prejudice.  She loves the novel, of course, but she was able to put a face to Mr. Darcy with the very dishy Colin Firth.  What red-blooded woman hasn't drooled at the scene of Darcy/Firth at the lake?  (I certainly have!)  Her great-aunt noticed her obsession and, when she died, she left something for Jane in her will -- an all-expense paid trip to England, to a place where people live as though it were 1816.  Jane sees this as the opportunity to get Jane Austen, Pride & Prejudice and Mr. Darcy out of her system.  Maybe after this trip she'll be able to have a steady relationship!  But as Jane takes on her role as a Regency lady, she is met with guests and staff not unlike the characters of P&P, especially the handsome and taciturn Mr. Nobley...<br /><br />As you can imagine, we get a modern-day retelling of P&P in Austenland.  At first, the idea of a twenty-first century career woman vacationing at a Regency-set place and assuming the role of an Austen-like character living her very own P&P story appealed to me.  What a refreshing, original idea!  Jane does live her own personal Pride & Prejudice.  She even encounters a Mr. Wicham during her stay.  Unfortunately, the novel, though only 193 pages long, is very dull.  If you are familiar with Pride & Prejudice, you will see things coming from a mile away in this book.  The characters are wooden and uninteresting, and there is no chemistry between Jane and \\"Mr. Nobley.\\"  Also, the heroine goes into the role of Regency lady with very little effort.  The mores and customs of the times are well researched, but Jane has no difficulty adjusting to corsets, heavy underwear and the high-waist gowns that are required for her to wear.  The author simply decides to gloss over those details.  Also, there's this quote: \\"Sometimes, she watched Pride and Prejudice.  You know, the BBC double DVD version, starring Colin Firth as the delicious Mr. Darcy and that comely, busty English actress as the Elizabeth Bennet we had imagined all along.\\"  The \\"comely, busty English actress,\\" whose name is Jennifer Ehle, is actually American.  Anyway, this chick-lit isn't very fun.  Helen Fielding did a much better and wittier job with Bridget Jones's Diary.  I'd say pass on Austenland, unless you're in the mood for a quick, unremarkable modern take of a beloved classic.he delicious Mr. Darcy and that comely, busty English actress as the Elizabeth Bennet we had imagined all along.\\"  The \\"comely, busty English actress,\\" whose name is Jennifer Ehle, is actually American.

B000060P79|5.0|I love the band. I got their newest self-titled album the day it came out, and I've loved every song. But about this album, it's got a lot of well written songs, although it's not anything at all like Blink-182 or Green Day or any of the other bands that people keep comparing Simple Plan to. They are their own sound, with their own music. They appeal mostly to a young demographic right with this album and with Still Not Gettin' Any, but they have definitly matured with the newest one. Bottom line? If you are into the new pop-punk style, get this album!

0316143472|1.0|I was hoping for a good laugh on a long train ride. This book isn't funny. I'm 3/4 through the book, and I got two chuckles out of it. In the last five stories, animals get abused or hurt. In one story, a goat is chained in the backyard and left to starve. In another, a horse is used in beasiality porn. In another, a mouse is burned alive. The list goes on.<br />Sorry for not thinking that that's just soooo entertaining!<br /><br />His stories are no longer truly funny, as in previous books (eg Me Talk Pretty One Day). They are vignettes of life -- observations and thoughts. Just that.<br /><br />The only story I enjoyed is the one that was already previously published in the New Yorker (of Wildflowers and Weed). It seems that that the author has run out of material.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Love the album. Portishead has taken new sounds and twisted them to their very specific mood again. It has great compositions. No doubt.    Only one thing bothers me. The final cut doesn't sound final at all. You sometimes hear instruments missing notes, playing through cracks. Even Beth's perrenially flawless vocals seem a bit rushed in places. Basically, the final mix is not all that sharp. At times, it may seem as if the band wanted it that way, but overall it feels rushed.
0790729350|1.0|Well,    this film is something of a 'curate's egg'.... As a reminder of the hippy scene of the late 60's it delivers. [Although looking back now, the 'scene' seems hilariously self-absorbed and frankly cringe inducing in places].As a social documentary,I'd give it 4 stars at least        But as a concert film it is dull, too 'chopped up' and not really worth buying for repeat viewing. For example,the butchered set of Hendrix was played over footage of all the rubbish being cleared up....hmm      So if you're primarily a music lover,in particular if you like full un-interrupted song footage,I suggest you rent this and buy something else instead    All together now- 'no rain,no rain,no rain....'!
B000UR366S|5.0|\\"Shine\\" is utterly delightful.  If you are expecting \\"Ladies of the Canyon 2,\\" Joni has forever been changed by the jazz sound that started to strongly permeate her music on \\"The Hissing of Summer Lawns.\\"  \\"One Week Last Summer\\" is like a symphonic jazz overture with melody flavored by memory and playfulness.  \\"This Place\\" follows with a strong melody and a classic Mitchell lyric, \\"When I get to heaven, if it is not like this, I'll just hop a cloud & I'm coming right back down here.\\"  \\"If I Had a Heart\\" is a political treatise that Mitchell hangs on melodic riffs, \\"Too much rage & desire; It makes you feel so feeble now; It's so out of hand -- big bombs & barbed wire.\\"  \\"Strong & Wrong\\" also mines similar territory, \\"Is that what God is for?  Just a Rabbit's foot?  Just a lucky paw for shock & awe?\\"  My favorite track on the CD is \\"Hana\\" with its strong percussion & Mitchell's backing vocals like an electrified chorus.  Like the Tennessee Williams play, \\"Night of the Iguana\\" could well be a jazz suite set in Mexico, \\"Can you hear the castanets?  The widow is dancing down on the beach.\\"  The title track is the longest at seven plus minutes and echoes Mitchell's theme of measuring our wartime actions with against our highest religious understanding.  Mitchell uses the Rudyard Kipling poem of the same name as inspiration for the final \\"If.\\"  \\"Shine\\" is a meaty, melodic, excellent jazz hybrid that only Joni Mitchell could write.  Bravo!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|radiohead have shown once more why there are the only true band that relly matters the create great album after great album.this is my 2nd favorite album in the world only behind ok computer wich will never be beat.IN RAINBOWS is perfect from start to finish and these are the most beautiful songs they have ever done.thanks to radiohead for blowing my mind with everything they do.get this album you will not be dissapointed it will stick in your mind and thats a good thing.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|The original [[ASIN:B000EHSVNW Poseidon Adventure]] was Irwin Allen in his disaster film best...ensemble acting with a tragedy to work through. He worked that formula like no-one else...so when Wolfgang Petersen went to remake it, he did what he should have. He scrapped what Allen was magic at and inserted his own strength in their place. Which meant characters that might not be the most interesting, but working as a team to overcome the odds (think [[ASIN:0767802470 Das Boot]]).<br /><br />To that end, his \\"Poseidon\\" is a faster paced, tighter and shorter movie than Allen's and moves at such a tear that it's hard to notice when it falters. The cast is helmed by Kurt Russell (playing troubled macho as only he can), Josh Lucas (loner gambler subbing for Gene Hackman's loner priest) and Richard Dreyfuss (gay man just jilted by his ex for a younger man). Along with seven other survivors, this group must battle fire, water and the clock to climb up the ship to safety.<br /><br />Minus the 3-dimensional characters, Petersen gives us a 3-dimensional ship. The effects are a marvel (the bonus disc shows you just how few CGI effects were used) and the opening wave scene is visceral in its blunt force. The capsizing boat, with the ensuing death and the mayhem, will scare the saltwater out of you. Maybe even more so than some horror movies. Little time is wasted between survival episodes, although the nod to Shelly Winters' swim team dialog from the original is a nice touch. The survivors overcome obstacle after peril and each more tense than the last.<br /><br />There is, naturally, a happy ending. Just who makes it out and how is the fun of \\"Poseidon.\\" Once it's over, make sure to watch the DVD extras, with the Crew Diary being interesting and the Special Effects feature fascinating.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|my faith in coldplay is restored after parachutes a great album and rush of blood one of my favorite albums ever, x&y was a minor dissapointment,after listening to viva la vida 3times this is coldplays masterpiece from the beautiful songs to the way evrything just flows together perfectly, outstanding production,coldplay has changed there sound just enough to sound fresh but not to the point that they would alienate real fans. 42,yes,viva la vida,and lost are some of the best songs coldplay have ever written,easily my 2nd favorite album of the last 2 years behind radioheads in rainbows,highly recomended.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|\\"Britons like a dose of rock band Coldplay to help them fall asleep\\" - a survey from hotel chain Travelodge found, according to a very recent Reuters note published early April this year. Well, should this situation persists even upon listening \\"Viva La Vida or Death And All His Friends\\", then these folks might want to see a doctor urgently.<br /><br />Coldplay's fourth album is, surely, their biggest venture into a more pop sonority, easily \\"digestible\\" by the masses, determined to conquer more and more fans and sympathizers in all corners of the world. It clearly has no connection to none of their past albums and this is just what makes it a worthwhile listening. It might be a sign that the band has redefined its own identity. Comparisons that has always been made to other bands like Radiohead or U2 are absolutely no longer valid if we use \\"Viva La Vida\\" as a reference. Definitely.<br /><br />Half the world had already listened to the album - either in legal or illegal ways - before its official release date in the US. The buzz around this album has been amazing here and everywhere: the marketing strategy of letting people download for free what is actually one of the best and most different tracks in the new album (\\"Violet Hill\\"), massive TV appearances with the iTunes commercial (running \\"Viva La Vida\\", another great song, on the background) and mostly positive reviews, passionately written, already out in countries on which the album was already released (most of the world had the album released on June 12), including some recent allegations that \\"Viva La Vida\\" track is a piece of plagiarism (look for the report at NME.com). All of that makes us wonder: Does the album deserve all the attention that it has been earning? Well, the answer is definitely YES (by the way, this is the song title of one of the album tracks - quite different indeed).<br /><br />This album comes to prove, more than ever, that U2 is U2, Radiohead is Radiohead and Coldplay is just Coldplay. Simple equation. Vive La Difference!ve La Difference!
B00168ML1G|4.0|Iron Man is a must see motion picture for those who love not only comic books but also those who want to see a form of entertainment with a myriad of great action sequences and special effects. Robert Downey, Jr., I must say, is perfectly cast for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Arguably, he is a larger than life individual who is playing a character who seems to be, well, larger than life.    From a philosophical and social standpoint, one can assert that the Iron Man story portrayed on the silver screen effectively elicits the advantages and disadvantages of being charismatic and brilliant. Like Reed Richards, perhaps the greatest scientific mind in the Marvel Universe, Stark is a highly intelligent individual whose talents draw him recognition. However, unlike so many of the other big brains such as Mr. Fantastic, Stark is a socialite who both embraces and is embraced by crowds. He is a celebrity, a lady's man, and a leading industrialist who has achieved international fame. And it is because of these traits that Stark is surrounded by those who claim to be his friends or fans but who may actually be, at best, people who are trying to vicariously live off the greatness of Tony Stark or, at worst, plagiaristic, corporate sharks who want to build Stark up with hopes of eventually tearing him down.    If the focus had merely been upon the social interactions of Stark and how he could maintain his levels of success both publicly and privately, a great movie would nonetheless be developed. But lest we forget, Tony Stark is not just those roles mentioned above. Despite the many hats he has worn, there is one ultimate alloying of Stark the man and Stark the hero: TONY STARK IS IRON MAN!      And it is those scenes that define the transition and transformation from Stark the noteworthy Fortune 500 figure to The Invincible Iron Man that make the story enjoyable, even occasionally hilarious. The Tony Stark in this movie (as well as the Iron Man comic book) is not a stereotypical nerd, for unlike Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, he does not necessarily succeed with his experiments the first or second time around. In fact, he is more like Thomas Edison; he has to do it over and over......until he finally gets it right!    There are several angles and aspects by which one can ascertain this particular cinematic experience. For those who are curious about what separates Iron Man from the other excellent movies to date that are based upon the superheroes of Marvel Comics, let me say this. Tony Stark, in order to become a hero, pursued excellence with his great mind and his unique social abilities in a way that his gifts and the developments thereof would cause him to deal with those who, over time, would see themselves, by comparison, in the proverbial Sea of Mediocrity and thus become jealous not only at the interpersonal level but also at the highest ranks within government intelligence.    If you want to see one of the top five movies of the summer, if not the year, then go see Iron Man. AND DO NOT LEAVE YOUR SEAT UNTIL WELL AFTER THE END CREDITS!
1416523359|1.0|I am really amazed at the level of maturity King's writing has taken. A lot of people credit the hit and run accident, but I think it was inevitable. While The Shining will always be my favorite, I have loved a number of his books written in the last 10-12 years. But Lisey's Story is not one of them.     If you want a mature novel with a woman searching for meaning with a twinge of the supernatural, read Bag of Bones. I could not stop reading that book. His writing style was so fascinating. Lisey's Story is something that you have to slog through. His writing style is very annoying (I agree with the other reviewer) with all the childish (not \\"child-like\\") phrases and the story structure (searching for meaning with a subtext of how an writer creates something) he has done many times before.    King is the king of the \\"big structural elements\\" (remember when everything was centered on an Indian burial mound?) and the \\"writer doing his craft\\" subtext is done better in other books (The Dark Half, etc.). The appeal of King is that he can have that \\"writing 101\\" approach to structure but still pull it off with interesting characters, great prose, and wonderful twists. Lisey's Story has none of these just a woman mostly talking to herself about crap like \\"bools\\" (HINT: the book is a big \\"bool\\"). I have owned this book for over a year and am still not halfway done with it. I have put it down and picked it up a dozen times. I can only make it through 60-70 pages before I toss it down and pick up something else.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|This is REALLY different! I did not expect the new CD to be like this although when I heard Brian Eno was going to be producing, I had a feeling it would be different.  I was not able to grasp it all at first. I mean they are radically changing their sound here, completely different instrumentation, orchestration, and production. My first instinct is I don't like some of it it because it sounds like a band trying to really experiment. I think Coldplay thought after X&Y they had become predictable and formulative.  Although I believe that is true somewhat (some of it was boring), although there were certaintly a lot of good songs on X&Y.  Especially if you include all the bonus tracks from the same sessions released in various forms. Well Coldplay is certainly not predictable here I do like many of the songs though, I LOVE the title song!  This will go down as one of my favorite Coldplay songs of all time!  I also like the first single, Violet Hill.  I also love Cemeteries Of London which has the trademark U2 guitar style (but that's not a bad thing here).  I also like Lost, including the accoustic version.  42 starts off very brooding and ends with a great musical piece.  It's a good song, and the start of a lot experimentation.  Lovers In Japan has a lot of instrumentation overlay, not a bad song but kind of a basic Coldplay song (like X&Y).  Than we come to songs like Yes and Strawberry Swing which like I said I cannot really appreciate.  I have to say I probably like Yes better because it's more upbeat but it's like two songs because the second half sounds completley different (and perhaps goes on too long).  Death And All His Friends also starts off brooding low key and than works up in a similar fashion as the great song Fix You did!  In the end I can say if your a Coldplay fan, the CD is very much buying.  I love several of the songs and like many others.  Albums like this can grown on you and later you may appreciate it more than you think. Coldplay still stands as my favorite modern group and this CD was bold enough to experiment with their sound and make something different!  I don't think another CD in the same direction of X&Y would have worked out for them. 2008 was no time for this band to get stuck in a rut!  The EP Prospekt's March also has SEVERAL more tracks to make up for the couple I did not like on Viva. If you put them both together, you have 40-45 minutes of GREAT Coldplay music!  This is kinda like X&Y which was a longer CD, but if you add in the UNRELEASED songs there is an entire hour of great music from the X&Y sessions as well.  Sometimes Coldplay doesnt quite know what to release or not to release as I heard Chris Martin admit to during one of his concert recordings.
B001AU8ZLK|2.0|After listening to \\"Violet Hill\\" for the last few weeks before the release of this new album, I was all geared up to hear an edgier Coldplay, much like the first album.  Instead, we get a much more \\"POP\\" version of Coldplay.  I was excited for nothing. This was a major disappointment.  The rest of the album is nothing like \\"Violet Hill\\".  It left me thinking, \\"I waited 2 years for this? A pop album? C'mon!\\"  I've listened to it multiple times now and I come away feeling the same each time.  I think you can take Coldplay out of the Alternative Rock Genre (which Amazon has!)and place them directly into the Pop Genre.  Right there with Britney and the gang. I was afraid this might happen after their last album veered in that direction.  Being a Coldplay fan, I find this very disheartening.  Maybe over time, I will find a way to enjoy this album.  Until then...
0765348780|1.0|Normally, a book/series where anything/everything goes would present some intriguing elements for readers. Normally, I enjoy a book where conflict and war reign throughout. Usually, I don't mind a generous display of magic. Unfortunately, I found Steven Erikson's GARDENS OF THE MOON way too convoluted for an opening installment to an epic SFF series. All of the following severely handicapped the reading experience: Erikson's liberal use of magic, nonsensical events, and intricate names of races, people, gods, creatures, magical houses/warrens, history and places, all of which develop Erikson's world. Oftentimes, I doubted even Erikson's capacity to keep everything straight. GARDENS OF THE MOON appears to emphasize world building above all else and I thought suffered from it as a result. The history, the races, ascendant hierarchy, etc. all detracted from the characterizations, prose, the pacing and even the plotting. I found the characterizations one-dimensional, the prose below-average to average, the settings sorely lacking, and the pacing dull. Unlike another book I'm reading, Erikson's GARDENS OF THE MOON never really grabs you. I was never really interested to read more in GARDENS OF THE MOON, much less entertained. I just continued to read out of rote since I harbor an obstinate habit of trying to finish books I start.    I thought Erikson did a relatively decent job of crafting the same event from multiple perspectives. For example, when the book first introduces us to the central focus of the novel -- the city of Darujhistan -- Erikson crafts a night from multiple perspectives: from a common thief, from an assassin, from various killers, and then from other Phoenix Inn regulars in the city. Erikson pursues a similar style at Lady Sinital's Fete in the finale of the book as the plotting comes to a head from various points of view: the alchemist Baruk, the eccentric sorcerer Kruppe, the thief Crokus, the assassin Rallick Nom, Captain Paran, Whiskeyjack and ourantagonist Adjunct Lorn, or the Empress's right arm. Unfortunately, many obtuse occurrences jarred the reading experience. For instance, Paran at Hood's gate (entrance to death) early in the novel and salvaged by the twin gods of luck and chance, Oponn. Tattersail's bizarre reincarnation in Kruppe's dream, and Paran randomly hijacked by the House of Shadow late in the novel. The Jaghut Tyrant and his source of power in an object (Finnest) develops as the primary threat late in the novel despite the Malazan Empire and its quest to conquer the city of Darujhistan. Meanwhile, the 7-foot tall Lord of Moon's Spawn Anomander Rake evolves as the most powerful entity in the story. Also towards the end, Rake seems to randomly appear, saves Paran from the House of Shadow's hounds, and then Rake compels House of Shadow's King Shadowthrone to recall his assassin partner the Rope from possession of the girl Sorry's body thereby rescuing the Coin Bearer Crokus in the process. Convenient? Yep. Convoluted? Yep. Entertaining? No so much.    Most of the time, I felt like I was reading a history text on a world of magic.  Not a story with interesting characters.
006091307X|4.0|Back in the sixties, I remember carrying a well-worn copy of LOT 49 around with me wherever I went, wherever I hung out in Berkeley. Pynchon was God; He knew. He gave us the California landscape, its craziness, its mindscape as no other author had done before. So what if the book was a put-on? So what if it was really about the \\"selling\\" or \\"crying\\" in real estate terms of the lot that is California, the state created by the 49ers? So what if the characters were straight out of comic books? It was the way he had woven it all so artfully together, a California of one piece, comprehensible for a change, maybe even understandable. I thank Pynchon for doing that. From time to time, I go back to LOT 49, taste the language and descriptions, do a few mental jumps in time back to that bizarre period in American life. Pynchon saw it all so early, so clearly.
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|I love Johnny Depp! This is quite a thriller but Depp is believeable in any role. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviewers who feel that this movie focuses too much on the tragic and fails to capture the positive aspects of both John Adams the man, and the adventure he lived through. The book leaves you with an uplifted feeling, but this movie focues too much on the tragedies and the negative aspects of John Adams personality. I think the fault lies squarely with the writer. There is only one writer listed and I think for a project of this scope more writers were needed. The series strives to be realistic, and yet it doesn't capture the joy and humor of life, nor the humorous side of the main characters, which is a huge, huge failing. Again I think this is due to weak writing--it's much easier to write tragic scenes than to come up with good wit and clever, naturalistic dialogue that real people with a passion for life might have together.    As to Paul Giamatti, I thought he had some good moments in the role. He was more convincing in his portrayal of Adams as an older man, than as a younger man. Wilkenson was good, Laura Linney was fine, the rest of the actors were just okay. The main problem is none of them had a good script to work with. But this is a movie worth watching for one scene especially, which was really a standout to me-- the scene where the Adams walk into the white house and we can observe the workers. This revealed something to me that I didn't know. An amazing moment in the movie that I will never forget.
B000YDDUIW|5.0|I really like this CD alot; The live venue gives some of their catalog a little extra punch!  Hard to believe half of these are live since they are so right on the money--it's almost like listening to a studio album at times. Nice addition of some lesser known Eagles tunes like Seven Bridges Road, Saturday Night, and All Night Long; Plus the addition of Life's Been Good only helps. great sound and great playing all across the board. The extended sax solo at the end of The Long Run is one of the best sax solos I have heard in a long time. A great look at a talented band in their earlier days. A must have for fans! Joe Walsh and Don Felder tear it up guitar-wise...or as much as you can tear it up in an Eagles song!
630469654X|2.0|Though the film itself is still an enjoyable adventure (as other reviewers have already stated), the DVD treatment of it is decidedly lacking. The only viewing choices are \\"fullscreen\\" which means (at least on my flatscreen TV) the sides of the picture are cut off and the image stretched to fit the TV from top to bottom; or, on the flip side of the disc, the so-called \\"letterbox\\" version, where the film is presented in its original ratio, but in an absurdly small rectangle in the middle of the screen.     You'd think if the studio was going to go to the expense of transferring a film to disc, they'd take at least a little more care with it. As it is, this version's not even worth paying Amazon's discounted price for; buy it used. Or, better, just rent it.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|Let me say I'm a big Judas Priest fan, but this CD sounds like a Liberace rock opera. Like maybe there's something in Rob's mouth, no screaming for vengeance or anything. I know there old, but geez, no guitar solo's to be found from 2 great guitarists. Anyway I give it 4 stars because I got a free Metal Masters ticket with my purchase so I can at least bang my head to some Motorhead. Rock On!!!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This was a great book and a real page turner, with a lot of unexpected plots.
032147404X|5.0|I've been casually shooting for years, but wanted to start getting serious. I got The Photography Bible, which is a good introduction to all the basics of photography, but that's about all. It doesn't really give you much practical knowledge or advice for how to get out there and take great pictures.     This book took up where the other left off excellently, though you could easily start using it as a complete novice and really start improving your photography. In fact this book is geared specifically for the complete beginner. The author's sole purpose is to get you taking better photos as quickly as possible and he therefore leaves out a lot of the technical jargon and explanation. He teaches you only what you need to do with your camera and setting to get a specific result. I could see this direct approach being a detractor for those wanting to know why to use a certain shutter speed, aperture , ISO or flash and if you want to know the science behind photography, this book is not for you, but it will be perfect if you're a beginner and simply want to get out there and improve your photos.     There are plenty of technical manuals out there for photography. This book is for everyone else. I highly recommend it!
1416563156|4.0|This book is kinda like the Grail Diary props that you can find on e-Bay.  It has tidbits of information pertaining the adventures of Indiana Jones as inspired by the tv show and movies.  It's fun to read.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Back in the mid-60's, the Beatles began a transformation from the pop sound of their first 4 albums to the psychedelic sound that made them the timeless legends they remain today. This album does the same for Coldplay. Truly innovative and successful bands need to push their boundaries, change direction, and use the road less traveled. Coldplay does that, and hits the mark spot on.    The sounds from their most well known songs are rarely present on this album. Coldplay's sound on this album exudes the process of meticulously placing layers of sound to produce 10 very dense, very intriguing songs. To add to that, the lyrics from Chris Martin are full of emotion and bring this album to where it should be and already is: the top.
0060926317|1.0|The message of the book is actually one of intolerance and racism.  It is racist to misappropriate the culture of another, distort it, and profit from it.  It is also racist to idealize people as \\"Noble Savages\\" capable of superhuman feats, but incapable of genetically engrained human traits (e.g., competitiveness & deception - much as we don't like to admit it, survival would be impossible without those traits).  This books promotes ideas such as \\"racial purity\\" and the like in the guise of complimenting Australian aboriginal culture.  It is no compliment to be idealized out of human existence.  The constant drumbeat of \\"mutant\\" and misguided Western cultures is equally offensive and racist.  A bad deal all around.  To state that the message of the book prevails in spite of its fabricated context is to deepen the disrespect to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.  If you want a true spiritual lesson, then pay heed to well-researched anthropology and derive lessons from those truths - not from a wishful projection of a never-never land.  It is not theology - it is not fiction - it is a cynical, racist and poorly-executed attempt to make a fast buck off the empty, narcissistic practices that pass for spirituality too often these days.
B000P0J05G|5.0|Yes the format is dead...BUT if you own an HD DVD player (buy it on close out) why not get the supporting HD movie software dirt cheap.  Yes these titles will be re-released on Blu-ray but why pay twice the price for the same HD quality picture...plus the HD DVD player is an excellent standard DVD upconverter...much better than the $79 DVD upscalers that are on the market today.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|Some of the reviewers here downplay this movie as if they went into it expecting to actually find the eternal secrets of the universe. Indiana Jones is the modern rendition of a fifties action serial. This means half the fun is the pulp writing, two notches above the script for a good Saturday Morning Cartoon. This is what makes me happy to see a new Indy flick, whats wrong here? Whats wrong is that some people think to much. Relax. Indy can't die. He drank from the cup of Christ in 1938, remember? So, getting blasted down the side of a rock, with insane speed and impact, inside of a refrigerator, won't harm the man much.<br />Next, just because he is old, doesn't mean that our man doesn't know how to say the right thing all the time, or know exactly what to do at every given situation, or fight. What is he, like 80? Sometimes you just gotta make it up as you go along...<br />There is no way that you can make a Hollywood movie these days the same way they made them in the eighties. I've seen Raiders on the big screen at several midnight matinees in the last few years. It looks pretty damned fake for the most part, but I don't care much, because the action is solid, and Indiana Jones is still the man. I don't like CGI at all myself, but I hardly noticed it in this movie. Except the monkeys. They did almost look like they were gonna bust out micrphones and start singing like disney cartoons. But that scene lasted two seconds, and yet how many people can't seem to get over it?<br />Cate Blanchett. Maybe her character is a bit like every other Russian female villain you've ever encountered, just short of being named Natasha, but I thought she was cool. Psychic powers too, nice touch.<br />Shia Le-whats his face wasn't so bad either. Sigh of relief from me, I expected the worst, seeing as how I read a few reviews comparing him to Jar Jar Binks. Ouch. It CANT be THAT bad! He wasn't that bad. He was arright. Combing his hair back every two seconds, playing with his pocket knife. He's not gonna be the next Indiana Jones, as is clearly stated by the end, but he makes a pretty good Short-Round replacement for Team Indy. Plus he can fence, and ride motorcycles.<br />Marion Ravenwood could still kick your a$$...<br />This is the supporting cast. Indiana Jones is your man. The rest of the crew fall into place nicely as our newest adventure unfolds. There may or may not be aliens, we are never really entirely sure what we see at the end. But apparently if you really do ingest all of the eternal secrets of the universe, your face will melt and you will be burned into particle dust.<br />MAN, I TOTALLY DIG INDIANA JONES MOVIES!!!!t gonna be the next Indiana Jones, as is clearly stated by the end, but he makes a pretty good Short-Round replacement for Team Indy.

B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I am a HUGE Coldplay fan and was looking forward to the new CD comming out. After hearing all the songs I have NO IDEA what the people who gave it ONE STAR are smoking because it's so NOT TRUE. Listen to the songs again,  how can you say 42 isn't a GREAT song????  Well to each his own.Can't wait till Oct. 26th!!!! FIVE (hundred) STARS!!*****
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|While past albums have been somewhat cold and/or slow to evolve, these songs are warmer, connect with you more immediately and reach a deeper level.    While there are a couple of clunkers (Lost, Violet Hill), the rest are very enjoyable and hold up well on repeated listenings.     Overall, a very solid effort.
B000OV170W|5.0|I picked up My Sister's Keeper after hearing a strong recommendation from a friend who had previously read it.  Despite my nerves about the \\"Horrible ending\\" everyone seems to discuss online, I gave the book (and Jodi Picoult) a shot.    I must say that after putting the book down only five minutes ago, that I could not disagree more.  I won't give anything away or say how the story developes, but I thought the ending was extremely well-written and fit very well.  Go into this book without expectation and let it take you where it may.     Apart from the ending, I will admit I thought at first that the story, though complex, was a very easy read.  I was waiting for a twist when really, Picoult developed the characters so well, a twist wasn't necessary throughout the descriptions.  By the end of the book, the characters, especially those in the immediate family, feel like PERSONAL family members.  I felt as they felt and angered as they did. I am glad I gave this wonderful book a chance. It's definitely one I will continue to think about for days to come.
0385340567|1.0|I am so disappointed with this book.  Why project your foreign political views on an American soldier?  I also waited breathlessly for this book.  I have read all of the others and couldn't wait for the next one.    It was plodding, and really led nowhere but to Despair in the end.    I will think twice about continuing to read this series at all.   The author has gathered a following of readers with certain perceptions of a beloved character.  Now, he appears to think he has made his millions and is ready to tell the world how he really feels.  It does not matter to him that this is \\"out of character\\" for our hero as we have come to love him.  It's called bait and switch.  Very sad.
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|They took a great premise and made a sleeper out of it....I couldn't have been more disappointed. Dopey acting in a teeny bopper snooze flick.
0743298020|3.0|The author had some really great ideas, some of the writing was very well done, but I'm sorry I thought the story was a bit vapid. I the characters, but didn't really feel connected with them. I felt like I was reading a book that would appear on Life Time on Saturday Afternoon.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|Well, yes, the actors, sets, costumes and cinematography are very pretty, but the film bored me to tears. Showtime's Tudors moves along better and keeps the watcher more involved, with plenty of sexy stuff to boot. Other than a boatload of historical inaccuracies, the funniest thing about the movie was that they spoke American English. A dudd in my book...
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|Being a big fan for many years I was very disappointed with this album. It is nothing like their others which are filled with beautiful melodies, great talent, and inspirational lyrics. This album captures none of that, but lacks in creativity and overall musicianship. I could hardly hear any piano work on the album and their was nothing that made me inspired. Highlights include the Album's title song, \\"Yes\\", and \\"Violet Hill\\", and the second part of track 5, \\"Reign of Love\\". You can find my copy of this cd later on today in the used bin at your local music store.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm in my late thirties and had my second child seven months ago.  I never had a weight problem in my life until then.  The pregnancy weight would not come off, no matter what I did.  With a second-grader and a baby and husband deployed to Iraq, I also didn't have time to exercise for more than 30 minutes a day.  I had tried other DVD workouts that were short enough to fit into my day, but I saw almost no change on the scales or in my body.  I bought this DVD in early May out of sheer desperation.  After doing the Level 1 three times, I lost three pounds and was able to fit into a size 8 jeans!  Now, a little more than a month later and at Level 3, I'm back to my pre-pregnancy size 4 and have lost more than 12 pounds, even though I have not done this workout every day.  This DVD delivers what it promises. It has given me my old body back, made me stronger and given me more energy. I can HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to exercise. These workouts will kick you into shape quickly.  They are HARD, but don't give up and you WILL see results.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|Philippa Gregory's novel, of the same name, is one of my top ten reads of all time.  Yes, the story was about the Boleyn Girl's, but there was so much more than the movie had to offer. The in-depth political intrigue, skulduggery, deadly betrayals and debauchery were vividly depicted. You became totally enmeshed in the 16th Century, Tudor atmosphere. It also made you realize that if there were ever a time-machine, it would not be a Century you'd like to visit...particularly as a woman.<br /><br />It became clear that the only thing separating women from chattel, was their momentary status, which they manipulated to elevate, their attire and whether or not they were being served, or the servant.  Either position was not enviable. In the DVD Featurette, Gregory described the 16th Century as possibly the worst time to be a woman...\\"they were simply beasts of burden.\\"<br /><br />The film was visually splendid!  The set, the costumes...everything was a feast for the eyes.  However, the story itself, represented only a small portion of the book.  The Producer decided to focus only on the relationship between Anne and Mary as they vied for the King's attention and the drastic steps they would take, at the behest of their ambitious family. The battle ensued, as they both began lusting for the Queen's chair. With Anne, it became a game of control and power, for Mary it may have been one of devotion. But, from either viewpoint, it was a disaster waiting to happen.<br /><br />Natalie Portman, best portrayed the fiery Anne. Johansson's role as Mary was not one of her best. She had very little change in affect throughout the entire movie.  Her beauty couldn't save her in this one. Bana was an excellent King Henry, depicted in his youth, when he was virile and strong...long before the paunch. Katherine of Aragorn (Kristen Scott Thomas) tugged at your heartstrings, as she has in all historical documents of that time. Hers was the ultimate betrayal, as she was so loved by the Court, only to be outcast for not producing a male heir.  But the impact on England's religious/political histories, remains today, making her one of the most integral characters of the King's Court, an area that should have been given more depth.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book, or studied the 16th Century, you might be a little lost with this film.  I would suggest that you watch the Biographies and Featurettes at the end of the DVD, as they will fill in some of the holes left in the movie.<br /><br />I wish the movie could have been more in keeping with the book, but realize that it would have required a movie of epic proportion, that would have probably been cost prohibitive and perhaps too long, in order to capture it all.<br /><br />I'd recommend seeing it once, but suspect many won't want to add it to their keeper shelf for repeated viewing.  If you haven't read the book, I strongly recommend it, though. It IS on my keeper shelf.r not producing a male heir.

0385340540|4.0|Not everything John Grisham writes is a winner. Remember 'The Brethren' about some highly unlikely judges in jail? And 'The Testament' was also a clunker. But basically Grisham is a safe bet, with a good tale, well told and the usual young and struggling Mississippi lawyer hero who appears under different names but always gets justice in the end. Well, forget all that. Here, our hero lives in Italy and he's not really a hero at all. But he's a hell of a lot nicer than the guys who are after him.    The Broker is a lot of fun. It's a just a great read - pick it up and whizz through it. It's not great literature, but it is Grisham doing what he does best - producing an intriguing plot, credible characters and a setting spiced with real detail that comes from knowing the location well. I liked it and I think you will.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Here's a band that will have some staying power in the years to come! I started liking Coldplay when I bought \\"X&Y\\" after all the Grammy buzz; what an amazing record! I was pleased to here that Coldplay can actually rock! Tracks like \\"Square One\\" really opened up my eyes to them and after playing out \\"X&Y\\", I moved onto \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". I noticed that each album had a distinctive sound; \\"Parachutes\\", sporting epic guitars and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" being heavily piano driven. \\"Viva la Vida\\" is no exception to the rule. The band takes on the heavier sounds of \\"X&Y\\" and evolves them to include other worldly instruments, giving them a more progressive sound. I've always been into experimental music like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Mars Volta, and, most recently, Radiohead, and I'm glad that a band as mainstream as Coldplay was brave enough to tread on that unsteady ground. Any band that takes that step and works with it will be around for years to come, and in Coldplay's case, that is a VERY good thing.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|this is probably her best work since SFIJ. the songs are so raw, true and personal. do yourself a favor and just listen to this album by yourself REALLY loudly and read along with the lyrics. you'll find at least one song to relate to and continue on an emotional journey. ahhh, alanis my fellow canadian...i've been waiting for this album for such a long time. you are back. you...are...back. oh, and please splurge and get the deluxe version. madness, limbo no more and on the tequila are simply wonderful. but seriously, if you don't like this album, well then you just simply have bad taste in music. for serious.
B0015FHDRW|5.0|There's not much I can say to do justice to this work. All I can really say is that you have to listen for yourself. And even then THAT won't do it justice. Go watch them live. Pure Bliss.
B00006SFBD|4.0|There are certain bands or artists that belong in a certain musical genre that I despise yet actually like listening to the band as they \\"do it better than the others\\". Whether it's just songwriting, innovation or just a better understanding of how to make their songs work, it might not be your typical kind of music but there's always that exception. I for one can't stand that extreme kind of metal but I always liked Opeth. \\"Deliverance\\", their 6th outing and the more heavier one whereas \\"Damnation\\" was its softer brother, continues its sound of huge, punishing and progressive riffs, growling vocals seemingly coming straight from Hell mixed with acoustic sections and clean singing. While it's one of their heaviest, it's also one of their most uneven.    Wreath: The song starts with some fast, brutal drumming and a series of great riffs and barely any clean parts make this a heavy opener but the problem is that there really isn't that compelling aspect to the song and the riff piled upon riff makes it kind of same-y. 2nd solo's cool though. Still, it's worth checking out anyway.  8/10    Deliverance: Big heavy dissonant riffs start us off before it goes into clean vocals and acoustics for awhile. More riffs and growls before Mikael comes in with his clean vocals and really help the song a big way. Most of the riffs afterwards are kinda iffy before a huge chugging riff makes the whole thing awesome, quiet interlude than probably one of the best outros the band has. Sure some sections could be dropped but as a whole, this is my favorite song off the album. 9/10    A Fair Judgment: It's sort of like a Damnation song but with distorted parts and with not a single metal growl anywhere, this is as accessible as anything off the record despite the length. While the opening piano meanders a bit, everything from the vocals to use of fingerpicked acoustics and solos near the end are top notch. The outro works well but seems like the wrong song to put it on plus it goes on forabout 2 minutes. Grr. Oh well. 8.5/10    For Absent Friends: A short interlude similar to \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\" and this one's just as gorgeous and worth learning but maybe too short for some. 9/10    Master's Apprentices: Cool crunchy guitar riff and quick drum beats come right off the bat and more of Akerfeldt's growling and occasional clean vocals which are kind of basic and somewhat uninteresting until the clean section with E-bow feedback notes, strummed acoustic chords and ethereal backing vocal melodies. The next heavy parts are alright to a certain extent but it's kind of a song that grows on you, even if some parts aren't as great. 8/10    By the Pain I See in Others: One of the more experimental tracks on the record with some saying it's the best track on the record while others, including Akerfeldt saying it's just really meh-inducing. The death vocals over acoustics don't work that well (even if they're more raspier than normal) and the strange circus-music part is...odd but aside from the occasional riff, it's kind of an uneven listen. 6.5/10    As evidenced by the making of on the \\"Lamentations\\" DVD, the recording of these 2 albums was marked with pains and stressful times and it's a testament to their ability to come away with 2 great albums. Well, Damnation is amazing, but Deliverance in a way is...great. Not amazing but let's face it, Opeth can't seem to do a bad album if they tried.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Big David McCullough fan here, from this: [[ASIN:0671869205 Truman]] to this: [[ASIN:0743226720 1776]], David manages to tell tales from our nation's history in a compelling, narrative way, proving the point that history is really all about the STORY. Taking a cue from one of his greatest books, HBO produced the miniseries \\"John Adams\\", and the results are phenomenal.<br /><br />Starting with John Adams surprising defense of the British soldiers at the \\"Boston Massacre\\", John Adams tells the story of one of Boston's most compelling Revolutionary figures. History, in a sense, hadn't been too kind to this brilliant man, painting him pompous, opinionated, and oft times stubborn in his outlooks. The book, and now this fabulous miniseries, have laid claim to attack this image by painting a more well rounded man, and in the process, removing him from a revolutionary demi-god, to something that he actually was, a man.<br /><br />The miniseries is rich and rife with details, and realism. I have to say that I've been very impressed with the quality and caliber of many of the HBO movie productions. From costumes to scenery to special effects (just watch the scene of Abgail Adams' view of the British seige of Boston to take your breath away!), every thing here is dirty and real. The debates on the Declaration of Independence are covered in length, and with sweaty brows and stubborn opinions, you feel as if you are there.<br /><br />What impressed me most about the book, and equally the movie, is the life long love affair/partnership that John and Abigail had in their lives. She served as his wife, and more importantly, as his sounding board for ideas, offering constructive and to the point feedback, and was the true backbone of the community. Laura Linney's performance of her is enthralling; her beauty is amplified by her downplayed performance, and matches perfectly Paul Giamatti's blustering John. One scene: John is debating in bed between staying true to the crown, or joining the patriots, and Abigail, trying to sleep, gently keeps on placing her hand gently over her husband's lips to calm him. Touching, brilliant!<br /><br />This disc is loaded with features, including one that allows you to watch the movie with historical facts coming up to deepen your knowledge of the scene and times. As a student of history, and a movie lover, I simply cannot recommend enough adding this impressive collection to your movie library. I'll be watching it for years to come, as will you!gail, trying to sleep, gently keeps on placing her hand gently over her husband's lips to calm him. Touching, brilliant!

B0002XG8L0|5.0|this is the brown bunny japanese dvd.  Basically a cooler version than the u.s. dvd. This version has commentary by vincent gallo - one of the best commentaries for a film I've ever heard, along with mike leigh's commentary for the film \\"Naked\\".  It's the sole reason I bought this japanese version.  This is one of my favorite movies. It has moments of pure insight, intelligence and extreme sensetivity.  The scene at the rest stop with Cheryl Tiegs is one of my favorites in the film.  There is so much going on in that little scene than there is in entire films, and all without almost nothing being said.  Pay close attention to the physicality of the scene:facial gestures, hand movements, head movements, eye movement. These are the clues to what the characters may be feeling. As in life, physicality can reveal more to us than mere words.  I would like to jump to the infamous sex scene. I think it's the most honest and responsible sex scenes ever filmed.  At times it feels like an invasion of privacy which is something you never feel during sex scenes in movies.  At one point in the film, Daisy says under her breath, \\"Can we turn off the light?\\" and \\"Can we go under the covers?\\". The character obviously insecure about her body.  That is something that will never be uttered or felt by a character in any other sex scene in any other movie.
B00127RAJY|2.0|This product is just an OK for me.  Its a great workout but a bit montonous after the 7th time.  Music doesnt get you \\"pumped up\\" and its basically the same routines in Levels 1, 2 and 3.  Is it worth the $10.00 I spent on it?  I guess
B001A50716|3.0|Yet another non US version of this movie.  I believe there is a market for dvd's in the United States.  Maybe if they'd edit in some action sequences and dub in Johnny Depp saying \\"I'm getting too old for this sh**\\" it could be released here. . . .blah.  The movie itself is a 4 to 5--gave it 3 because of the above issue.
B001AU8ZLK|4.0|The mainstream critics have gotten this one right so far, I think; but if you are a long time Coldplay fan, take their minor enthusiasm for the new album and multiply it a few times (or, if you are not fan, ratchet it down a few notches) and you will know what to expect. The song structures are definitely experimental in a relative way (though, I think critics forget that Parachutes and Rush of Blood had other moments that stepped outside of pop conventions as well), with touches of world music flavor to accent the soaring, synth-driven pop songs. Yes, the band is trying in a way that was not evident on X & Y; some may find it pretentious, but I respect the mood and drama they are going for and it works for me.    I wish the album had a little bit more of the edge that comes through on Violet Hill--some of the songs just feel too soft around the edges. Viva La Vida, which sounded so aggressive and dramatic live, kind of melts together and loses its power somewhat. Still, its a great song and that and the rest of the album definitely rewards multiple listens.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Viva la Vida, or Death and All His Friends, is another solid effort from international poprockstars Coldplay. While the album may not offer the kind of revolutionary changes that Martin's puff-piece interviews would lead fans to believe, Coldplay does enough new and right on this album to continue on their trajectory of pleasing fans, record labels, radio stations, and the world at large.<br /><br />The easiest way to attribute the album is as such: if you've liked Coldplay's previous three studio records, you'll like Viva la Vida; if you hated them, you'll hate Viva la Vida. It really is that simple. Coldplay is a band that seldom disappoints its fans, but at the same time it seldom impresses the realm of music listeners and reviewers that consider themselves aficionados.<br /><br />On Viva la Vida, Coldplay drop the fuzzy synthesized production and weepy-eyed lyrical stylings of X&Y for a record that is more straightforward, varied, and stylistically interesting. Brian Eno is known for his ability to chip away at a song as opposed to build onto it, and in the case of Viva la Vida, his sculpting touch is very appreciable. Gone are the obvious and repetitive guitar and piano riffs of X&Y and A Rush of Blood to the Head, though instant anthems as strong as Clocks and Yellow remain in tracks such as Viva la Vida. The riffs are replaced with more articulate soundscaping, borrowing gaze-styled guitars from My Bloody Valentine without creating a record that can be classified as belonging to the shoegaze genre, or any other genre, for that matter.<br /><br />In general, Viva la Vida is a very nice effort from Coldplay, and the efficiency of the songwriting works well for the pacing of the album. Clocking in around 40 minutes, Viva la Vida ends before it has a chance to overstay its welcome, a problem that has become more and more pronounced for the band on each album since Parachutes. Ultimately, if you like Coldplay and light alternative rock with an electronic tinge, Viva la Vida is for you. It's not exactly a revolution, but it is a nice little coupe.t's not exactly a revolution, but it is a nice little coupe.
B0017WI5VQ|4.0|I first heard Adele on You Oughta Know on VH1, and i loved the 10 second sample of the song that played, unsure of the title. I went online and downloaded the complete album through a torrent. I fell in love it, enough said. I could not wiat until June 10th so that i could hold the rela copy in my hands, and I loved adele. I completely fell in love with her. She's a breath of air just seconds before dying of suffocation from the disgusting and unbelievable state of the music industry now. You msut get this album, one of the ten best albums of the year. No lie!! You will not be dissapointed. THe live set that comes as a bonus is terrific as well.  In my opinion, the album flows beautifully, showcasing deep emotion and jaw-dropping arrangements. If you're tired of the southern rap that has seized the charts, or sick of stupid, no talented singers singing songs that were produced in 5 seconds, than adele is for you.   I highly recommend:    -Daydreamer  -Best for Last  -Chasing Pavements  -...THE ENTIRE ALBUM!!!
B000V86OKG|5.0|This is an excellent show with great actors. The plot is so different and while watching in on Showtime it had me on the edge of my seat. I love the show and couldn't wait for the second season which was also excellent. I am now waiting for the third season to begin. I love Michael C. Hall and the other characters are also very good. Dexter's character was so different from the one Michael played on Six Feet Under. He is very, very good. Everyone I know that has watched the show loves it too. I will be purchasing all the seasons as they become available and hope it is on for a long time.
B000N3SS80|5.0|JENNIFER ES MUY BUONO - THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT AND I DON'T SPEAK A WORD OF SPANISH.BUY IT.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Coldplay's music comes off like it's another sequel soundtrack of Arthur C. Clarke's `2001: A Space Odyssey'.  Mesmerizing, the echo effect of Jonny Buckland's guitar is second-cousin twice removed from U2's The Edge with lead singer Chris Martin's voice sounding like a homely, but likable, version of Bono.  Far be it from me to complain or make a claim of plagiarism--more like natural alchemists: they remain sustaining with their songs, much like The Cure did in their day.      Their new release `Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends' is a concept album, one that encapsulates the dichotomies of the broader subjects of life with clever--if not contradictory--phrasing to match the mysteries they try to reflect. While the quality is consistent for the entire album, there are no songs as great as \\"Clocks\\" or \\"Green Eyes,\\" yet the album is greater than the sum of its parts.    Featuring some sublime and substantive piano work and some exotic and excellent violin, there's enough variety to make this work a must have for fans and newcomers alike.    The subject matter is twofold, often like the structure of their songs--just like the C.D. title.  Most of the tracks are really two songs fused together, segues if you will, like the Beatles did on `Sgt. Pepper' and `Abbey Road,' except they do it within a song instead of between songs (reminiscent of Kelly Clarkson's \\"Irvine,\\" off of 'My December,' which is really two songs, except she did it with a break).  Like `...Pepper,' they even reprise the first song at the end.  \\"Life [is indeed] in Technicolor\\".      Musically, they change notes and tempos to reflect the theme.  The best songs in the middle do this, including \\"Lost!\\" (the folly of winning and losing); \\"Lovers in Japan\\" and \\"Yes,\\" (yearning, 'Lust/Caution' and attainment); (The first part of \\"Lovers...\\" sounds like U2's \\"Where the Streets Have No Name;\\" the second part like something off of 'October'.)  \\"Viva La Vida\\" (those who reign on heaven and earth, \\"St. Peter won't call my name/...When I ruled the world.\\") and \\"The Violent Hill,\\" (the secular and spiritual realms, \\"...Long and dark December/When the banks became cathedrals.\\")      Exceptions include \\"42,\\" which may be in four parts--I keep losing count--and invokes the memory of the dead, reconciling the divide between the living and the departed.  \\"Strawberry Swing\\" is a country fusion and properly remains one solid song.  The lyrics celebrate the wonders and pleasures of life, and, call me all wet, but I believe recently deceased Swedish director, Ingmar Bergman, is invoked here.  After all, Bergman revered the fruit, and depicted it in exuberant community partaking in `The Seventh Seal' and `Wild Strawberries'.  Similarly, \\"Cemeteries of London,\\" is celestial, and while the words are elusive to me so far, it is one of the best tracks on the C.D.      I love this album despite its alleged flaws.  I am hypnotized by its reverberating rhythms, and get lost in its everyman lyrics.  \\"Lost!\\" is an encouraging reminder that winning is tentative and limiting; not everyone can win at once after all.  If the nearly subliminal wisdom doesn't get you, then some of the last lines will: \\"No, I don't want battlefronts from beginning to end./No, I don't want to recycle revenge.\\"     What better way to travel through life than with in your car with this Coldplay C.D.?  It provides food for thought, but, ah, what exquisite food for the ears and mind.
B0013FNC38|5.0|The best song on this album is by far \\"A Beautiful Mess\\", a touching slow song with great rhymes and a melody that will break your heart. \\"Love for a Child\\" is another song that you won't forget about Jason's child abuse as a child growing up. The fast songs are great as usual, but these two ballads will really touch you and leave you wanting more.
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|While there was many on here who gave some negative reviews and low star ratings, I decided I'd judge it for myself. I read all the good and bad reviews on here before I watched the movie, and actually enjoyed it.    If your looking for great acting or to analyze and pick apart the movie, than it's not for you. This movie is action packed through and through. The acting was decent, nothing to complain about. Like another reviewer stated it's not going to win an oscar, but will win a sequel, I 100% guarantee it.     If you feel in the mood to have your heart racing and just want to watch something exciting, than judge this movie for yourself.

I take this album as very religious and this one hits a place for me. 5/5<br /><br />\\"42\\" - 3:57 - My favorite song on the album..the songwriting is genious..the way it moves from classic coldplay to pure catchiness. 5/5<br /><br />\\"Lovers in Japan\\"/\\"Reign of Love\\" - 6:51 - Lovers in Japan is so genious..the music the melody the piano line. It blows me away everytime i hear it. Reign Of Love is sooo good the piano in it is so epic. 5/5<br />\\"Yes/Chinese Sleep Chant\\" - 7:06 - Yes is classic Coldplay and Chinese Sleep Chant is good noise rock even with the hard to understand lyrics. ha 5/5<br />\\"Viva la Vida\\" - 4:01 - Classic song for sure..their biggest US hit ever. 5/5<br />\\"Violet Hill\\" - 3:42 - Probably my least favorite on the cd cause i wore out the song months before this cd came out due to the early release of the song. I still love it tho. 4.9/5<br />\\"Strawberry Swing\\" - 4:09 - Very creative pop song I LOVE IT. 5/5<br />\\"Death and All His Friends/The Escapist\\" - 6:18 - Their album closers are always hard to beat. I love the catchiness in this song so much! 5/5<br /><br />All you haters out there need to really listen to this cd with an open mind and forget the fact that they \\"only have the same formula\\" if you look back to all the classic albums by classic bands...they all evolved as musicians just like these guys...Coldplay are very talented don't be hatin :)
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Coldplay is in the running for most improved and inventive band of the year. \\"Viva La Vida\\" has been selected as the song to lead the charge on mainstream radio, and Coldplay expands on their new \\"cultured\\" sound. Gone are the melodic experiences that were \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Speed of Sound,\\" and welcome to the string-based epic of \\"Viva La Vida.\\" Is the new sound better? While most would say no, I think the song grows on you. And in the end it's nice to have a fine work of art worthy of Da Vinci, rather than the pumpkin carvings of Young Jeezy.<br /><br />The sound is as I said a melodic epic with lots of strings. The music goes perfectly with the song, and it seems to hit all the right notes. Structurally, it is equally as brilliant, building to its epic climax complete with choirs and bells. Chris Martin can only add to the song with his ever-melodic vocals, which have never sounded better. You have to admit, Gwynth Paltrow and Chris Martin have only gotten better in their work, and they have seemed to hit new highs this summer.<br /><br />Lyrically, it undeniably has a lot of Christian imagery, which would make sense since he's Catholic. But the overall meaning could be a myriad of things. But in either case, the lyrics, the music, the vocals, the atmosphere, all mesh together in one glorious tune. And amazingly, the song comes out a bit catchy.<br /><br />Overall, Coldplay's best? It's epic. It's melodic. It's different. It's brilliant. It's Coldplay. I can't wait to listen to the whole album, but if it's anything like the two I've heard so far, it should be the best album of the past few years. A true work of art in the sea of tranquility. I can only hope it reaches #1 on the Hot 100.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I loved \\"X&Y\\".  This is NOTHING like it!  There isn't a good song  on the entire C.D., not even the title track that they have been  hyping on I-tunes.  A very long wait with a really BAD result!  If you want to buy a new C.D., I suggest \\"Grand Archives\\".  At least their songs are interesting.
0307387178|5.0|I'm not entirely sure how much I can offer.  Hopefully I can provide my unique perspective, and hopefully it will help someone in their decision making.<br /><br />I read \\"Into the Wild\\" after watching the movie.  I was intrigued by McCandless's story, and hoped the book would provide more information than the movie.<br /><br />It didn't, not exactly.  It provided a few more details, the \\"correct\\" version of events.  A few more insights the author offers directly about his subject.  The book was solidly written, well researched, enjoyable.  While trying to explain the \\"why\\" behind McCandless and his actions, Krakauer gave me what I was looking for--other examples of people who shunned society and lived in the wild, other places to learn more about Chris and others who shared his worldview.<br /><br />If you're hoping to find large chunks of information in the book that Hollywood cropped out, you will probably be disappointed.  If, like me, you watched the film and had a desire to simply learn more this book will be an excellent read.
0743455967|5.0|I picked this up with reservation, but not necessarily hesitation. Sure, Stephen King is the world's most popular (I'd guess richest, too) novelist, but it's all crap, right? I mean, I read Cujo when I was a freshman and it (not to be confused with It, as I haven't read that one yet) sucked like 30 different kinds of a**. And he's just too popular to know s*** about s***. It'd be like The Eagles writing a book about music or Spielberg writing a book about movies. Wait, you like some Eagles songs? Joe Walsh rules? And Spielberg kicked all sorts of a** with Jaws and Indian Jones? Oh, that's right, I forgot.    Perhaps I took the long way to get to my point, but the fact of the matter is that even though Stephen King wrote Maximum Overdrive and Dreamcatcher (and Cujo), he also wrote The Shining, Misery, Thinner, Carrie, and The Stand. Of course, if you're a competent writer -and King is, regardless of taste- and you write two books a year(ish) for 30 years, you're bound to have some good ones and maybe even a few great ones. And of a bunch of s***, too. But hey, he wrote \\"The body\\", and that's what Stand By Me is based off of. If you don't like Stand By Me, you're a dumba** and Rob Reiner is going to anally penetrate you in Hell for the rest of time.    So is it luck that King is popular? Is it just a matter of prolificness surging past brilliance? Well, yes and no. King says that before his accident in the late 90s, he would write 2000 words a day. Every. Single. Day. That's four 180,000 word novels every year (King does short fiction, too, so it's not like he's just pumping out s***** alien books nonstop. He takes the time to pump out s***** alien short stories, too). That's a lot of writing, and anyone who does that for a few years with the intent of getting better is going to get better. Narrative craft is a craft. It can be learned. King was already inclined towards writing anyways, as some people are. He just happened to be sufficient and willing to learn. He gotbetter.    This may seem like a big rant on King's career, but when a writer does a book on writing, what are they doing if they're not saying \\"This worked for me. Here's the deal.\\"? That pretty much exactly what King does, in a really killer informal tone that makes it seem like you're sitting down with him, drinking a Pepsi (he's been clean from everything since some point in the 80s, as we learn in the memoir section of the book) and shooting the s*** about writing.    Obviously I don't agree with him on everything. He's not keen on writing workshops, but I see his point. There are a lot of morons that attend workshops with the intent of using it as a shortcut as opposed to part of the revision process. He underplays the importance of theme and symbolism and everything else that enriches fiction beyond being \\"just a story\\". King writes stories, and he says repeatedly that the story is the most important thing. Of course, he's correct. However, he puts everything else at such a distant second, third, and fourth that it doesn't sit well with me.    Does this book stand on its own as a handbook on writing? Maybe, as it champions the use of freewriting and a strict, loving dedication to writing (and reading!), which are two of the most important things a writer should know: just f***ing do it, man (and read it!).    I'm a sucker. I bought this book not because I need another book on craft -I always need another book on craft, which isn't the point- but because Stephen King wrote it and I wanted to see if he was full of s***. He's not always right, but he's certainly not full of s***. I suggest this for fans of King who are interested in his life and the source of his approach to writing. I also suggest it for writers, because even if you think King sucks, he's more popular than you. I know that I'm retrograded to the point of youthful idealism, but I think everyone kind of wants to read the popular kid's diary. This one just happens to be well written, funny, and bythe guy who gave us the opportunity to see Sissy Spacek wax a bunch of motherf***ers in the high school gym.    (And to those who warn against the book being more memoir than craft, it's closer to being half and half. The memoir section gives a nice perspective, and certainly puts his opinion about craft into the type of context that reveals just how much of writing is opinion: all of it. Writers shouldn't be made to read this in the same way that writers should read Carver and Kerouac and Hemingway, but writers should still read it.)
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This is Coldplay's 'The Unforgettable Fire'.  The whole album has a lush sonic palette akin to that classic U2 album.  Indeed the instrumental opener 'Life in Technicolour' definitely has the feel of 'A sort of homecoming'.  That song, 'Cemeteries of London', 'Lovers in Japan', 'Reign of Love', 'Chinese sleep chant', '42', 'Lost!' and 'Death and all his friends' will appeal to the experimental ansd avant-garde fan.  In short, these are the songs by which this album will really come to be judged.  Of course they're still obviously by Coldplay (indeed 'Violet Hill', 'Yes' and 'Viva la Vida' are pretty standard Coldplay) but they're far more original, sonically lush and interesting.  If you thought Coldplay were boring before, I would urge you to lay aside your prejudices and listen to this album.  It is genuinely good - not great - and I suspect will come to be seen as a brilliant departure for the band. I have a feeling this may be 'The Unforgettable Fire' to their 'Joshua Tree'. I always liked certain tracks by the old Coldplay - 'Don't panic', 'Spies', 'Everything's not lost', 'Clocks', 'The Scientist', A whisper', Square One', 'A message' - in short, the moody songs alluding to something more grandiose and interesting - but felt constrained by some terribly lazy songs and bad ones -  'What if?' and 'Twisted Logic' for example.  Now I can honestly say I am a fan of them. They're now in the same league as Radiohead and the early U2.    Standout tracks: 'Lost!', 'Death and all his friends', '42', 'Lovers in Japan' and 'Chinese Sleep Chant'. Weakest tracks (sorry Coldplay obsessives!): 'Violet Hill' and 'Yes'.
0671027344|5.0|Stephen Chbosky did an excellent job with this book.  I realized all the mistakes Charlie made along the way and realized how fortune and lucky I am in my own life.  This is a great story and well worth reading!  I did not want to put it down!  I am interested in reading other novels by Chbosky!  The ending was unexpected, but at the same time, amazing.  Overall, it was a GREAT story!
B0013D8LOK|4.0|I have always been a fan of Johnny Depp but was very hesitant to try this movie because i really don't have the patience to sit through musicals, with the singing and the prancing around the stage and what not. However let me tell you this is no simple light hearted musical!....oh yes there will be BLOOD!!<br /><br />I don't want to give away to much of the story but ill explain the basic premise. The story begins with a Barber and his lovely wife, so lovely in fact that the Barber is thrown in jail for no reason by a corrupt judge who is looking to take his lovely wife for himself. 15 years later the jaded Barber returns with vengeance on his mind and madness in his blades. So thus begins his tale of terror and bloody murder.<br /><br />This movie/musical is almost all singing with some dialog mixed in here and there. All of the actors in this movie are not exactly singers, but they still perform very well. The list includes:<br /><br />-Sweeny Todd- Johnny Depp<br />-Ms Lovett- Helena Bonham Carter(Harry Potter-Bellatrix Lestrange)<br />-Judge Turpin- Alan Rickman(Harry Potter- Prof. Snape)<br /><br />There is one negative that i would like to point out though. I'm not sure if its a technical problem on the DVD or what but sometimes it can be a little hard to make out what the actors are saying when they are talking and singing. I found that i had to rewind a part or two to catch what they were saying.<br /><br />Overall this is a great movie that if you have any interest in horror you should definitely give it a shot and if you a Johnny Depp fan you should give him the benefit of the doubt and watch the movie. Just try to to get squeamish when the blood starts to flow....
B0011HOEY4|4.0|Film based on the real character, black gangster from NYC area who was distributing Blue Magic drug in late 60s and early 70s.  It is a story of a man driven to succeed in the only trade he knew, at any price.  He uses Italian Mafia tactics and employs his immediate family and cousins to help him with distribution.  The genius of his channel distribution is that he has arranged for drug delivery via MP transport between military bases on the US east coast and Vietnam where the war was fought.  As he pushes competition away with his superior products and takes away cut from the middle man that happens to be NYC Special Investigation Unit, he starts building enemies, slowly but surely.  The moral of the story is that this man, Frank Lucas, no matter how ruthless is the picture perfect of the American Dream.  He works hard, he is driven and dermined and has his goal.  He becomes someone that white people have to recon with.  But at the end, his empire is like a house of cards where he takes NYC police department, his family and himself down to the dungeons.  His wealth and success are not saving him from the justice system where he spends 15 years of his life before he can be free again.  Wonderful cast and a great story.  Many of the support actors are from HBOs shows like \\"Deadwood\\" and \\"Wire\\", they look worn out, raw and full of supressed anger - fantastic characters.  Great movie.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|I have to admit that I was surprised that Ford would reprise his role as Indiana Jones.  Heck, I didn't even know there had been talks of making another Indiana Jones.  So, this was a surprise for me.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull dealt with a particular topic that I would have never guess that Indiana would explore.  I guess it only makes sense with him being an archeologist/adventurer as well with the time frame.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and his band of friends race against the Soviet agents to acquire the crystal skull that is believed to be originated from the Mayans.  The lead Soviet agent believes the crystal skull holds psychic powers.  Indiana fights to save the crystal skull from falling into the wrong hands.  However, his attempts are deflected as he faces capture, betrayal, chases, shoot-outs and, of course, surprising revelations.  Ah, the good ol' Indy movies!<br /><br />Despite some erroneous facts, such as the siafu ants, and some not quite-up-to-par stunt works, Indy remains capable of capturing my attention throughout.  I'd see it again!

B0015XASFS|5.0|I really enjoyed Josh Groban's new CD \\"Awake\\". There are new songs on the CD and he sounds just fantastic. I highly reccomend this purchase. This is a great CD for anyone who loves Josh Groban.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Downloaded this album from that music store owned by everyone's favorite fruit company at midnight Tuesday. I had heard Viva la Vida on the radio and thought \\"oh how comforting, Coldplay is back.\\" Its far from the best single they have ever released, but it was good enough to force me to preorder the whole album. Having listened to the whole thing three times through, I can say without any question or shadow of doubt that this is Coldplay's best attempt since Parachutes. Im not ready to say that is it better than Parachutes yet, but it seems to get better every time I listen to it. I love the new sound on the more adventurous tracks. So far I think that the track \\"Viva la Vida,\\" the reason I bought the album in the first place, is probably my least favorite, mostly because it is a little to generic. Literally every other track is brilliant. Some of the pop-junkies will be disappointed by this album because it doesnt sound like the soundtrack to the second season of Grey's Anatomy, but true fans of music will be thoroughly impressed.    Update: now that I've had a chance to read my review, I can say for certain that this is the best Coldplay yet because of the growth they have shown.
B00005JPNZ|2.0|Back in 1989, the Indiana Jones franchise was given a perfect opportunity to go out on a high note with [[ASIN:B000F7OPCC Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade]].  It was a great movie (almost as good as [[ASIN:B000F201HK Raiders of the Lost Ark]] and certainly better than [[ASIN:B000F7OMZ2 Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom]]) that left no loose ends open and it left no promise for a sequel.  Now there is what appears to be trend in reviving franchises that lay dormant for over a decade.  Just look at Rocky, Rambo, Die Hard, and Superman to name a few.<br /><br />Having said that, IJatKotCS is astoundingly disappointing and what I believe to be by far the weakest entry of the series.  RotLA to me was not just a good movie - it defined a lot of who I was as a child.  IJanToD was not a bad movie, but I could never really connect with it.  Fortunately my faith in Indy would be restored when I went to see IJatLC at the normally cynical and disillusioned age of 16 in 1989.  I felt like I was 9 years old again - if only for 2 hours.  I didn't go to see IJanKotCS just so I could write this bad review for it, but I find myself in the \\"I waited 19 years for this\\" camp.  I wanted to enjoy this movie, but for these reasons I could not:<br /><br />1.  Bad CGI:  For the last 15-20 years, love it or hate it, CGI has dominated visual effects.  That is no excuse when you consider the tremendous amounts of money that went into this film.  I was downright appalled by the swordfight between Mutt and Irina.  The background looked like something that MIGHT have been acceptable for a 1998 Nintendo 64 Tomb Raider knock-off.  The giant ants looked about as realistic as rejects for a SciFi Channel movie of the week.<br /><br />2.  The Monkeys:  How could they be friendly toward Mutt and hostile toward the Russians?<br /><br />3.  John Hurt's character:  Hurt is one the world's greatest actors.  How did he get stuck playing some buffoon that repeatedly says \\"Henry Jones\\"?  Anyone that can wear long hair and a beard could have played this role.<br /><br />4.  Mac:  What was the point of this character?  Was it to annoy the viewer by having someone who couldn't decide which side we wanted to work for?  He picked the wrong profession in treasure hunting.  He should have gone into politics.  John Kerry and Mitt Romney could have learned a lot from his flip-flopping.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are a few good things that keep this movie from be a total waste of time.  Ford is believable as a 60+ year old Indy.  He is not the 40 something man he used to be when Indy was in his 1980s heyday.  He still pulls off a some funny lines like \\"I like Ike\\".<br /><br />When not completely stained by CGI, several of the action sequences were phenomenal.  The library chase scene was one of the all too few scenes that echoed the earlier Indy movies because it relied solely on expert stunt work.<br /><br />And contrary to what some others may say, I did not object to the Soviets as being villains.  The year was 1957, meaning that WWII was over for 12 years and Nazis could no longer be used believably.  I'm not trying to take away from the heinous evil of the Third Reich, under which over 6 million died in death camps.  Yet the fact remains that many millions have died as a result of Communism as well.  Evil is evil, be it Auschwitz or a Siberian gulag.  It cares little for ideology.  That is not a virtue of the film so much as it is me saying that these politically correct reviewers are clueless.<br /><br />In short, the film's weaknesses sharply outweigh its strengths.  If a fifth Indy film is the wings (and judging by box office receipts, it's a strong possibilty), let's hope much more effort is invested in it.  Otherwise, let the franchise die with this movie - disappointment and all.e played this role.    4.  Mac:  What was the point of this character?

B0019N8P2W|5.0|I remember some time ago checking for this and signing a petition for this show to be released on DVD and am STUNNED that it has not happened yet.<br />I see cartoon shows like Undergrad with a complete season DVD and I have never even heard of that show.<br /><br />Daria is a great show that had (and still has) many loyal followers.<br />C'mon MTV!<br />Make up for your current lackluster programming (My Sweet Sixteen and Pimp my Ride,etc) and release this DVD set.<br /><br />Listen to the fans.<br />They give you money.
0783229526|5.0|This is not a film I would normally choose. The title did warn me.      In part I watched because Johnny Depp is in it, but I had to keep reminding myself it was him. There are few such actors in the world. Olivier was one.      By the end I was wondering who was having the bad trip - the actors or me!     Brilliant but horribly gruesome.     I'm glad I wasn't in that 60's
B000BKJ78K|5.0|For anyone interested in sci-fi this is the series to own. Great scenery, action and story-line.
B0018AK9RA|3.0|While it's admirable for the band to try something new and dangerous, it didn't grab me like I thought it would.  It doesn't rock hard like Painkiller, it doesn't have hooks like Screaming For Vengeance, and in general it just feels too dramatic and over-the-top.  Also, the intro-song-into-the-real-song thing that it does throughout the whole album actually really bugged me.  Nostradamus is definitely not terrible, but won't leave you in awe.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This is definitely a fun movie and the music is just great. I like the actors and will look at this movie whenever I need a pick me up.
0446402389|5.0|I'd actually put this book up with some of the best I have ever read. The motive for the killer is a little shaky, but the plot is suspenful enough to keep you interested throughout the story.     The best thing this book does is puts the story into a real setting of Stalinist Russia. The story lets you see how the USSR operated during this time. So you get a bit of history with a great story.
B00005MAM2|1.0|When I first saw this in the early '90s, I thought, \\"What a load of over-rated technotrash.\\"  I thought the underlying plot about a government conspiracy of psychics, a dystopian future, and some kid getting messed up on pills before turning into a giant tentacle machine was retarded.<br /><br />And I was right.  I rented the movie again, about a decade later, wondering if perspective would change my mind.  Nope.  It's still a bad film.  Sure, it's pretty and all, what with the awesome motorcycle and...  Uh...  Damn, that and the giant psychoturd at the end are really the only two visuals to come out of the film, aren't they?<br /><br />Man, this thing's horrible.  Just don't even bother with this hot mess.  Instead, here are some useful things you could do with your money: go buy some Uniball 207 medium point gel pens and draw your own hentai; pick up the first two volumes of \\"100 Bullets\\" and get hooked; \\"Sea Monsters\\" for the Wii; light some cigars with some Lincolns.<br /><br />One star.  But only because I can't give it fewer.
B000JIJPZY|2.0|I bought this mat as I thought it would be good for my daughter to grow with.  The velcro butterflies and toucan seemed like a good idea at first, but now that she's had it for about a month the velcro has worn and the butterflies don't stick for very long.  She still likes the musical tiger, but the butterflies were what held her interest and now she can pull them off immediately.  She's 4 months old and I bought it when she was a little over 3 months old.  I think it's worth it to spend a little more and get a bigger play mat without velcro as it will last longer.  She loves to play on the Tiny Love activity mat that our babysitter has.
0061537934|5.0|THIS IS A NO-SPOILER REVIEW<br /><br />Enzo is a mixed breed dog adopted by Denny Swift, a customer service rep in the maintenance department of a luxury car dealership.  More importantly, Denny is an aspiring race car driver, and Enzo is his greatest advocate.  The story is told eloquently by Enzo, who desperately wishes he were human so he could speak, and have opposable thumbs.  Enzo learns a great deal from his interactions with Denny, his wife, child, and friends.  He also learns by watching television, something Denny has told him he shouldn't do.  Denny and Enzo are committed to taking care of each other and their family.  A tragedy strikes, and Denny's chances of becoming a race car driver are at risk.  Enzo relates the intimate details of his relationship with Denny through his entire life.  Both Denny and Enzo are driven yet compassionate.  Enzo tells Denny's story, and his, with a deep understanding of the human spirit, the importance of love, and how much can be learned by dealing with life's difficulties.  Not a boy and his dog story; this is a dog and his owner story, and Enzo is a wise story-teller.  The plot is compelling and the book is well-written.  This is a wonderful novel, the best I've read in 2008 and is suitable for all readers except pre-teens.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Duffy rocks! Great bluesy voice, some very good tracks, no surprise that \\"Mercy\\" is such a big hit for her.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|...you don't always get it at first. In 1983 when THE CUT was released, I was as excited as I imagine most Floyd fans were and ran right out and bought the record. Well, I was 15 years old, and the whole thing was lost on me! I hated it, excepting \\"Not Now John\\", the albums only faster-paced rocker-and put it away for years.<br />Then one day, I ran into an old friend and we started talking about the Floyd-The Cut came up and after telling him my feelings on the album, he strongly suggested I give it another chance-and I'm very glad I did! This record is teeming with beauty and feeling-And although the contributions from the other band members are more as studio musicians than writers, the performances are unbelievable-Mason's drumming is at it's most powerful and precise-and Gilmour's solos and lead vocal on \\"Not Now John\\" are among the most emotionally charged of anything Floyd ever did. Of course, it took two keyboard players and an orchestra to replace Rick Wright...This album bleeds with feeling, quite possibly a projection of the musicians realization that the end was here. But they performed their parts like consumate professionals, and with tons of heart and soul.<br />This album is an emotional roller-coaster, conceived brilliantly and concisely. Like all the great Floyd albums from \\"Meddle\\" through The Cut, it has a life and personality all it's own-You can't compare \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" to \\"Animals\\", and you can't compare The Cut to any other Floyd creation. I will tell you one thing, though-If you don't run the gamut of emotion that Roger Waters intends, from sadness to anger to humor and back, maybe you should just walk away, and come back later when, well, you've grown up a little more.
B0015FHDRW|5.0|If you like Green Day you'll love this. If you like Sock-Hop sound, punk, anything by the Monkees or if you can imagine Green Day doing an Austin Power's soundtrack, then you'll really love this. It has a wonderful old-skool sound. I can't get enough of it. It really doesn't sound like anything Green Day has done before, so  it is really fresh and nice to hear something different from them. I love this album and everything Green Day has done (if you didn't know, the band consist of Green Day plus a few others). Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  Tara
0060578793|5.0|Excellent survival handbook. It is very well written and has illustrations for everything that is taught, plus it comes the British SAS, a source that has been using these techniques for a long time. It provides extensive information on subjects that are critical and brief overviews of subjects that are unessential. You can use this handbook whether you plan to use it in a single climate type or in multiple climates. I use this book for my deployment in Iraq, I recommend this book.
B000002UZ1|3.0|Very well liked if you like the beatles in the Late 60S phase this is the Cd For You !!  Very well re-mastered and sounds good Favourites are My Guitar Gently weeps,   Let It Be, Lucy in the Sky, Long winding road , A must to have !!!
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|What a blast it was to hear on the radio an interview with, who turned out to be, Donna Summer. I wondered what was bringing her to the airwaves and then, she announced a new album and the track \\"Stamp your feet\\" flooded my car. Something struck a cord for me in that song. Maybe it was that her music faded for me over 17 years ago, at a time when AIDS hit, it was like the spirit of the disco era that she represented died along with thousands of men. This song \\"Stamp\\" was like a jolt of energy, an anthem declaring \\"we are survivors\\". And not just that but also: \\"we're better than ever.\\" So, excited and energized, I pre-ordered \\"Crayons\\" on Amazon and waited by the mailbox. \\"Crayons was written as a collections of singles\\" Donna says and, indeed, I'm imagining each track could be a hit. Had I not heard her interview I might have thought her album a bit szichophrenic. But I've fully accepted each song as a different color, a different stroke of the artists brush, creating unique and wonderful listening pleasures. There are many reviews on the web today speaking well of this album: how suprising and refreshing that it's not a \\"cover\\" album of songs we already know, and so many other glowing perspectives. I will try and add to those other reviews and say that the album is amazing. Donnas voice is rich, full-bodied like a chocolatey cup of familiar cocoa. It's comfort food from the dance past, mixed with many suprises. What a treat! Ziggy Marley, adds to the mix another familiar flavor in a track that creates a new, yet knowing note. It's an instant classic album. It's a gift from an artist with such a colorful past, of both highs and lows, (who's isnt?) it's hard not to relate to the panorama of rich emotions portrayed. On a technical note, the production quality is unbelievable, worthy of turning up the dial, WAY up! Enjoy!
B0018AK9RA|2.0|Well, it's always the same thing: if a band repeats its formula, they are accused of playing it safe, of not daring. If they try something radically new, they are accused of separating from their roots, of being disloyal to fans, etc...<br /><br />Obviously, Priest tried NOT to play safe here. Whatever one's opinion about the songs quality (or lack of), one thing I simply did not get and I think is unforgivable: the lack of fire in the execution of the songs. Blame it on production, etc, they seem to be sleeping! There's no blazing moment jumping out of your speakers, no amazing bridge or chorus. THe sound is flat, dead. This, I don't get it.
B000SEGCRS|3.0|I had a tough time finding reviews for the Kindle version for this book - I wish Amazon would have an option to separate them out. I have volume 2 in paperback. I was hesitant to get a Kindle version for one reason - the Kindle version does not have color nor are the photos very good. And that is why I rate it 3 stars - it is not going to be the same as the book itself.<br /><br />However, the photos and images are included in the Kindle version which I think is still a good thing as it helps to fully understand the particular subject.<br /><br />I don't have volume 1 in book form and can't compare them side by side but the Kindle version appears to be the same (based on how volume 2 is).<br /><br />I bought the Kindle version because we Kindle users always have our Kindles with us and whenever one is out taking pictures it's good to have those tips with you. And it works just fine on the Kindle for looking them up.<br /><br />They didn't break the tips out on separate pages like the book. I am not sure why except it may have made the file larger and with the photos taking space it may have been a mess. But it doesn't create a problem that I have found yet. The full table of contents is there and also appears to work correctly (I didn't try every single one).<br /><br />I know a lot of people complain about his humor - it is bad. But I can understand his intention - just like computer people, they try to make their profession more important by intimidating amateurs (with good reason). This is his attempt to make you feel more comfortable. It doesn't bother me that much, I still get the tips.<br /><br />The sample is not going to help you decide. Amazon needs to fix that by making it the first chapter, not the TOC or acknowledments or other worthless info.<br /><br />But his info is very good, lots of great tips for taking better pictures.<br />Some complained about it being for beginners. If you are that good, why are you looking for a how-to book?<br /><br />Update: It appears that they didn't do a lot to port this book over to the Kindle - the index is still listed but with no references, just a list of words. It doesn't create problems but adds a few unnecessary pages.the Kindle - the index is still listed but with no references, just a list of words.

0743455967|5.0|I was never a fan of Stephen King's novels. I tried to read The Stand, The Tommyknockers, and The Gunslinger, but they bored me to tears. On Writing is terrific. I laughed at all of his funny childhood stories, wanted to hug him when he shared his painful memories, and learned a lot from his writing advice. This book is not only useful, it's deeply entertaining. Read On Writing if you want to be a better writer, or for fun.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Why so many negative reviews for an album that is solid all the way through?      In some ways this is classic Coldplay, in some ways it's something totally different.  It's mainstream, but it's intelligent, and it's obvious that the band put forth their best effort with it.    A classic case of fans having a preconceived mindset of what a band's album should be before it's released.

0743290119|1.0|This is probably one of the worst books I've ever read. The plot, if you can call it that, went nowhere and the book just dragged on and on and on. I kept hoping it would get better but it never did. The characters were boring and so cliche. The story lacked any kind of depth or emotion and was just filled with superficial material. I've never written a review for a book, but it was so terrible I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

1561006742|5.0|Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.<br /><br />Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.<br /><br />The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\"  In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.<br /><br />\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.<br /><br />NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production.

B001B1T7BU|4.0|this is a great live-action take on the original classic starring two-time Golden Globe winning actress, Glenn Close. This DVD has been out of print for several years now, and is long overdue for a new release. Currently the cheapest that you can buy the only other dvd version of this film, is at $55 dollars, which is used in an \\"acceptable\\" condition. I really would like to update my disney collection, and I am very happy that they are releasing this DVD. Although, I do prefer the animated version, I do like the acting performance of Glenn Close's greatly convincing role as Cruella Devil and Joan Plowright's perfect fitting role as the Nanny. Any Disney collector would definitely be excited that this classic, which actually generated $320,689,294 in theatre sales, when it was released in 1996, is being brought back out of the disney vault for the first time in 9 years!!!!!
B0014XCMVM|5.0|\\"I loved this whole Album, its great to see Alanis back behind the guitar and bringing great music to us. If you check out any song I highly recommend songs 1. - Citizen of the Planet and song 3. - Straitjacket, they are both outstanding songs. The only song I don't care for is the last one called Incomplete, but hey 10 out of 11 songs is rare for an artist. The last song is just a little to dry for me. Hope this review is help and enjoy.\\"
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I first saw White Nights many years ago and loved it.  Having recently watched it again I was a little cautious about how it would be, so many years later.  It's still just as great.  Typically dancers don't have the best track record when it comes to quality acting, but Baryshnikov is terrific.  The storyline is incredibly believable and the music adds perfectly to the drama of Communist Leningrad.  I would highly recommend this movie to lovers of both dance, and good drama.
B0016AJU2C|2.0|To begin, I'd like to say that I have very much enjoyed nearly everything Alanis Morissette has done up until now.  I am a big big fan.  As is probably evident from this preface, I was however fairly disappointed in \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\".       The focus of this album definitely seems to be the lyrics (I'll get to the music in a minute).  Each of Alanis's past albums has seemed very personal, as though each one were the expression of a new catharsis.  Her discography has consequently been fascinating to follow, as Alanis has shown a real arc of maturation from the angst-ridden \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" to the calmer, more reflective \\"Supposed Former...\\" through the experimental, yet tight \\"Under Rug Swept\\" and \\"So-Called Chaos\\".  I was really looking forward to seeing further progression along this path.  However, this latest album seems more like an effort to reconstruct the angst of \\"Jagged...\\" and it comes off as rather self-conscious and contrived, or at the very least played out already.  While the poetry of the lyrics is structurally well-done, the content resembles the ravings of a bipolar narcissist.  I'd be curious to do an analysis of the lyrics to determine what percentage of the lines contain the words \\"I\\", \\"my\\" or \\"me\\", because I'd be willing to wager the answer is nearly ALL of them.      Either Alanis is dredging up past feelings for the sake of songwriting, or she really needs to get over it already, whatever \\"it\\" is, because it's starting to feel like listening to your  friend who's still pining after her lost boyfriend or dead dog six years later.  Rather than reaching a new stage of maturity, the lyrics of this album are most evocative of the diary of a tortured, albeit well-traveled, 15-year old girl.  This angst seems to be used here not as an inspiration as it was in \\"Jagged...\\" but as more of a template, and it consequently seems stale.    I'm focusing so much on the lyrics because the music itself in this album is uninteresting.  I don't findanything here that Alanis has not done before which was better in its previous iterations.  I will say, however, that there are a few OKAY songs.  I found \\"Moratorium\\" to be fairly catchy, and I suppose \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\" will find its way on a few girl to boy mix tapes (does anyone make mix tapes anymore, or am I just old?).  I'll also say I kinda dig the windup and chorus to \\"Incomplete\\".  \\"Citizen of the Planet\\" at least has a bit of a hook, but comes off as so self-righteous that it makes me wish I was listening to the similarly themed but much more pleasant \\"Thank U\\" from \\"Supposed...\\" instead.   The rest of the songs are problematic for various reasons, but a big one is that much of the album's self-obsessed poetry is incongruously wrapped up in electronica dance tracks.  As you might guess by what I've said so far, these songs make me feel much more obliged to psychoanalyze the singer than to bust a move (do people still say that, or is that just something that oldsters do with their old mix tapes?).    I vacillated quite a bit over whether to give this album 2 or 3 stars until I listened to the bonus disc.  I feel very comfortable docking a star just for the song \\"On the Tequila\\".  Someone owes me something for allowing that song to violate my ear canals.  The best way to summarize my thoughts after listening to \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" is to say that I am eager to hear Alanis's NEXT album. Hopefully this was just a short detour off the path of her otherwise stellar discography.
B00005LK94|5.0|Wow.  I\\"m still trying to figure out how I received this purchase so fast, less than a week!!  The movie was received in excellent condition and it plays great.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|This is a perfect example of why one should read the book first. In this case Philippa Gregory's Boleyn books provided just the right mix of history and speculation to make for an indulgent read. The movie however was exhaustingly boring. I could hardly wait for Anne to be without head. I find Natalie Portman generally a pleasure to watch. In this role she was simply silly, unbelievable both as a tricky temptress and/or a victim. The larger casting error here was Scarlett Johansson.  She is unconvincing at best in this period piece. I suspect as with her singing, if the audience cannot be distracted by her breasts her lack of talent really shines through. This movie was visually attractive with out be screaming big budget. More character development may have resolved the casting errors. Or not.
