B008DMBO7U|5|Quite impressed with the quality of these ceramic wiring harnesses. Easy plug-and-play installation upgrading my factory harness to heavy duty will help protect it from the higher strain introduced by my aftermarket headlights. Product was received on time and in perfect condition. Highly recommended for the price and quality.
B004NUZ50I|5|very nice tool!
B002N5YEHA|5|I was really surprised at how effective and long lasting these are. I've tried all the brands. Not a fan of the inky blue ones or the thick green stuff, the baby powder one smells good at first but doesn't last. This product is clear and you leave it in the bowl for a while then scrub...cleaned the bowl great. Did not have any odor issues in the tank either. Pleasant surprise.
B00YVIHZFA|5|AMAZING!<br />You get what you pay for! In this case its excellence. Very bright compared to other reflective tapes I've purchased. Customtaylor tape also doesn't bubble up like other brands either (shown in added picture). Has a unique pattern design that sets it out from the rest, as well as a strong adhesive when applied with a heat gun. (likely still strong with out if you don't own one)<br /><br />This tape is fairly form shaping when applied carefully, creating cool and unique effects upon refraction.<br />I picked up both the sizable rim tape and the body strips.<br />There needs to be more quality reflective tape decals like these. :D
B007GIYI5C|5|Fit perfectly on my F150 2006 XLT. Was really easy to install. Took it through the Car wash right after, and not a drop of water came through. Okay maybe just a couple of spots. Okay, a Lot of wet spots. But, it was because i decided not to read the instructions, and install it like a boss. I read the instructions after, and not as many wet spots.
B00U0OAF1K|1|Mine didn't work had to buy new led controller wiring was all backwards returned it instead and got something better
B00BSGE74A|5|These worked great in my RV. I replaced every interior bulb with these and now draw less than 1/10 of incandescent bulbs. Takes a bit to get used to the bright white color, but worth the money.
B006NSN7OE|5|Great Good Stuff
B00CC4LX2G|5|very good and fast service would order again
B001AVTYZA|5|seem to last the longest behind big power
B00WMK6Z46|5|While searching for replacement mats for my Toyota RAV4, I had an opportunity to give these a try at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and review. There are SO many choices when it comes to floor mats and ordering online without being able to see them in person can be frustrating!<br />Floor mats are one of those things that, if you end up getting poor quality mats, they are annoying and remind you that you made a bad choice every time you get in and out of your car!<br />The mats arrived quickly and I was nicely surprised at the quality of the mats for the price.  In the past, I've purchased mats that cost about the same as these and they were thin, poorly constructed and wore out quickly.<br />These mats are pretty substantial with deep channels for keeping rain and snow off the interior.  For a universal, cut-to-fit mat, they ended up being a perfect size!  They are not too thick as to interfere with pedal operation but weighty enough that they look like they will hold up well.<br />The material is flexible enough to have some give unlike many of the other types that are so rigid that the high points actually break off.<br />Overall, I feel like for the reasonable price point, these should hold up well and they are attractive :)<br />Hope this info was helpful for you as you make your buying decision :)
B000E8OTJ6|1|I ordered two sets. One had just no gas in it and did not work. The second was the wrong Shock in the packaging. That sums it up.
B002S405DI|5|Installed on my 2005 Duramax LLY. It fits 2004.5-2010 duramax's. It's the flange style, not the bolt on LB7 pipe like in the picture. Start by removing the 3 heat shield bolts on top of the turbocharger. Flatten it out with your hands and remove from engine bay. Next remove the 3 10mm heat shield bolts from the stock down pipe. The middle bolt can be tricky. The best way I found to remove it is from the top engine bay, drivers side reaching down with a 1/4&#34; drive ratchet, 10mm shallow socket. Next remove the passenger side inner fender well. It can be removed by taking out all of the plastic clips. Unbolt the stock downpipe from the back pipe using a 7/16 or 14mm wrench on the band clamp.(varies from model to model.)  Next unbolt the large 14 mm bolt from the engine block bracket. Next remove the two 1/2 inch nuts from the transmission dipstick. You can get to these through the inner fender that you previously removed. Take off the nuts but do not remove the dipstick as it is very hard to reinstall. While pressing the now unbolted dipstick against the firewall, pull the stock downpipe heat shield through the top and out the engine bay. Next unbolt the 14mm or 7/16 band clamp that connects the stock downpipe to the back of the turbocharger. sometimes the band clamp will get stuck. I suggest using WD-40 to loosen it up. You may have to use a flat screwdriver and a small hammer to get it free. You should now be able to remove the stock downpipe from the engine and out the bottom of the frame. Reassemble everything like you took it apart and don't forget the nuts that hold the dipstick on. Replacement of the stock heat shields are not necessary, but are optional.<br /><br />I just did another one of these on an 08 LMM. The only difference was that I did have to pull the dipstick all the way out and cut about 2&#34; off the end. Other than that, same process.
B00TFWIKAG|5|This looks great on my bar next to my humidor. Liked it so much, I had to purchase a second one.  Can't wait for my next cigar party.
B0000AZ6NH|5|Exactly what I hoped they would be. Fit my wakeboard boat perfectly with just a little extra strap that folds up nicely and tucks into the hook and loop wrap.
B00MMLJ0BU|5|Works great came in 2 days
B00AAHU7EC|1|Poor quality plastic, The Thin Blue Line Deserves more respect! Garbage.
B010RFFG38|2|Alignment pins were too close together to fit cam gear holes . Had to grind one pin out , relocate & reweld it . Worked fine then . Maybe just the luck of the draw that I'd get one mismade .
B00MGSC2IW|5|Exactly what I needed and delivered very timely!
B001C9E59U|4|Very nice kit.  Belt had no &#34;helper&#34; cam or crank markings, no big deal just use those on the vehicle.  The bearings were NTN, I could not identify the OE Hyundai manufacturer which were just marked &#34;Korea&#34; so I feel confident they are at least the same quality or better.  Gates put together very high quality kits, most with OE parts as available.
B0080KN7RU|5|Great price
B00062ZIN6|4|Fits perfectly but feels cheap
B000C31J9G|5|Good product, good prce
B00MH4663C|1|This was an Amazon Warehouse Special - so I expect it was returned by someone else.  It came fully discharged. I charged it for 6 hours and it seemed OK but was DEAD when I needed it the following day - It will not hold a charge. Also, the instruction booklet is smaller than tiny and written in the worst english I've ever encountered, and I've read lots of manuals written by non-native english speakers.  There was no instruction on how to turn on the red safety light - I found it on line (double tap power button) but it did not work, even when the unit showed a full charge.  The one time I tried to put the battery clamps on my battery, one of the cheap plastic clips flew apart - half the clip went one way and the spring went the other way! Product advertises 8ga battery cables, actual cables are marked 10ga which is thinner.<br /><br />All in all, I don't think I'm going to order a replacement unit.
B00F68GYXI|5|Enable me to do a fix myself that the shop charges $300 for! And I am NOT particularly handy. Thank goodness for the internet.
B00EW6BSU4|5|Fantastic!! Now I can put my pirates of the Caribbean on the front of my black Chevy Tahoe!!!!
B000G72VHM|5|Good quality product
B000C5YFUE|5|About a 25% discount from the lowest price in my area. OEM for Toyota so the quality should be there. Original equipment lasted 15 years and 140,000 miles plus. Saved a minimum of $33 over local prices. They don't give my mechanic as good a discount usually. It's Japanese OEM too which usually means twice the lifespan of American OEM (if they just meet specs). Manufactured in Taiwan.
B0009IBJE4|5|Great battery charger!
B005VFWOOE|5|very nice, especially for the price. always seems bigger in the pic, but just grab a ruler and see for yourself how big it is, since they give dimensions
B00DZ6GR2G|5|Common failure item in BMW Z3's.  Look on the Internet for any number of write-ups on this repair.  Not easy, but worth the result.
B00CPKV8JU|4|Just as described wife really enjoys riding more
B005MX2RPG|3|is not nearly as loud as my factory, back up alarm. I am dissappointed
B00EVY2SKG|3|I expected these to be better than a regular hand towel in some way, but they really aren't. Nothing special about them, but nothing wrong with them either.
B001O7PNS2|5|I have used this product twice, now. I am very satisfied with the ease of application and apparent effectiveness of this product. Water beads up on my car as it should and there is a minimum of polishing when applying. Spray on, spread it around just like cleaning a window, then rub off with a clean cloth and a few swipes. It isn't anything like the paste-style applications. No film, no dust, no laborious buffing.
B005LD3VF2|5|Right part the first time. Thank you.
B0089LTFF8|5|Perfect fit as expected. took no more than 2 mins to replace.
B000TYOQVQ|5|It fit perfectly. The price was great plus I have 2 extra knobs if needed in the future,
B007M2Y1FE|5|Very nice quality
B001JT12A8|4|good on my utv
B006NSN7OE|5|Just as described.
B00C1YI2XA|2|Lights are bright and easy to install. Only problem they are poorly wires and one stopped working after 2 weeks.
B00GWFB4NO|5|Great novelty tire or tube valve covers
B00B0NY33G|5|Perfect fit. Thanks!
B00THR39SC|5|Awesome. Installation took almost exactly 30 minutes. Mainly just getting each piece lined up correctly. Made from very flexible material so you can adjust if for some reason the holes do not line up exactly. Double sided adhesive was better than expected. Smooth finish like a typical jeep fender flare.<br />Only complaint was that some hardware was missing, had to go to autozone to get a replacement.
B00W6YSCVC|5|They look so cool  fast shipping
B001OMVCIC|5|If the air springs holds up over time, this will be the best upgrade to the truck. Easy to install.
B00NQ83SKM|4|good light, but support cant be installed because dont fit!
B00J733A2Q|5|I purchased this back on Sept 2014 for $436 with free ship for my 2002 Accord coupe 4 cylinder EX-L . The original problem was a weird loud rattling noise coming from under the car. I put the car on jack stands and listened with the motor running. After diagnosing that a piece of the honeycomb had broken off (it happens often for cats), I got this. The installation was easy, but you will need to buy 6 new longer bolts. Yup, the old heat shield is a throw away. Be sure not to park on dry grass to be safe.<br /><br />July 1, 2015, I passed the Cali smog test. They no longer stick that thing to measure emission in the tailpipe. Instead they plug a computer to the port under the driver side dash. My concern was that sometimes a vehicle might fail the smog test if new sensor or a new cat is installed. It takes about 20-50 miles for the car's computer to adjust. Aftermarket parts such as O2 sensors can be a bad idea but this aftermarket cat worked well for me.
B002UCAEU2|5|Worked great.  Bought them to replace my broken ones in my truck camper.
B011CVKW76|5|Have used pump three times so far. It has performed flawlessly transferring Kerosene. It's so easy to use, just hook it up, transfer fluid, and done! Far exceeded my fondest wishes and did the job quickly with no effort on my part.  And it's durable so I know it'll last.
B0018NI4LA|5|Got stolen when we came back in town.... 1-2 weeks after we got back felt like a complete waste of money.
B00NW8PSUO|5|Received item promptly - easy to install - seems durable & well made - and most importantly IT WORKS!!! Cool beans.
B001HXZT14|5|Great price on these well constructed key chains<br /><br />Good quality, sound construction, good stiching..<br /><br />Good value
B0073WGOLW|4|Solenoid fits the 400 xplorer as advertised and it showed up on time.
B007RHX2FY|5|This Product fit my 2000 BMW 528i perfectly and has not provided any issues at all. I will purchase from the seller again.
B00AKA6QC6|5|Great product. Now I can take the cap off of my oil housing without buggering it up. Fits great on my 2007 e92 328i.
B00JM766IC|5|bought to replace a missing table support in my 2004 Roadtrek 190 popular. Fits great!
B00E63THQA|3|Just received this so the 3 star rating is an initial review as I have not had the chance to test the vacuum seal out to it's fullest yet. Why the three stars? Well, when I took it out of the box and moved it around it sounds like there is sand or something loose inside it moving around. So I figure something is inside, I open it up and remove everything inside, then I turn it upside down and it still sounds like sand or tiny pebbles are loose moving around in there somewhere. I know this is a minimal complaint but not so when I am in an ASL class that is filled with silent hearing people trying to learn and here I am making all of this noise trying to drink water because of some manufacturer defect. Also, don't bother getting the powder coating, chips off so easily, I rubbed my thumb on the bottom and pieces of paint chipped off.
B006H1P3TE|5|Very expensive but worth it.  If you can afford it, I heard this is best wrist brace money can buy.  Prevented another break to my wrist.
B00EKE77DK|5|Great helmet!
B0006SH4NC|5|Easy on, Easy off. Great shine!
B002OKGQ02|5|It fit perfectly!!  Thanks!
B00NG87WBI|4|First, the sound. These pipes definitely sound excellent; simple, throaty, and muscular. The sound is more aggressive when accelerating but mellows once you come off the gas at cruise. This exhaust will turn heads without being so loud as to be obnoxious. I haven't been overwhelmed in the cabin, either; while you can't miss the sound when accelerating, there isn't really any drone at speed.<br /><br />As for power gains, I can't really say. I am not going to dyno over just adding an exhaust. It might be a little bit more responsive, but nothing more than a subtle bump. I highly doubt the manufacturer's claim of 39hp increase, as that would amount to nearly 9% gain. A catback just isn't going to do that, nor did I expect it to do that. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to bump things up 10-15hp though.<br /><br />Now for why I dinged it a star. I would have given this a five-star review, but an inherent design flaw prevents me from doing that. As I was finishing up the installation, I noticed that the pipes come very near to the driveshaft at the junction of the X-pipe with the tailpipe/muffler assembly. I triple-checked my installation, and everything was setup correctly. There is really only one way to install an exhaust on this car; the hangers and rubber mounts make it pretty fool-proof. As I inspected things closer, I realized the reason for the low driveshaft clearance is the way the pipes are (not) bent. The factory pipes route wide around the driveshaft, whereas these pipes essentially go straight back with no bend to stay clear of the driveshaft until after the X-pipe, at which point the tailpipes have bends to accommodate the differential. In any case, the clearance to the driveshaft was so low that I was uncomfortable using the factory-supplied clamp to join the X-pipe to the tailpipe. It is a thick clamp and would have further reduced the clearance. I ended up buying aftermarket band clamps to connect the two pipe assemblies. The final clearance was probably about 0.5&#34;-0.75&#34;. There is virtually no play in the exhaust assembly so I was okay leaving these pipes, but I did for a second consider going back to stock out of fear for the driveshaft. I read reviews for these pipes on several web sites, and I was very surprised no one else mentioned this flaw - but it is definitely something to think about before you purchase.<br /><br />All in all, I like this exhaust and I will not remove it, but had I known about the driveshaft clearance issue before purchasing then I might have considered other competing catbacks more seriously.
B005R4LFTY|1|The LED light is not bright at all. Plus it hard to see the road when it's raining or snowing. I would not recommend these lights
B00AZ4S4RM|4|Good for the price
B000GZVDK0|3|Needs instalation kit need to specify coustomer
B00ON0K9TK|5|Bought this for the BF. He got a new M4 and I knew he'd love this to go with it! Which he does :)
B00S1K4P48|5|It was what I expected, it came unbroken(!), and it fit my car mirror.  Very pleased.
B00G49NYKY|5|I put this on my work truck I drive through job sites and it still kept my tires looking good. I have recommended this to alot of friends
B00F2B80YK|5|Works as it should
B00CUXCQCK|4|This thing is solid and does exactly as it is supposed to.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is because i had to open up one of the holes that aligns with threaded holes on the frame.  Opened it up maybe a 1/16&#34;.  Other than that, everything lined up as it should.  Be prepared to do some trimming to make the factory frame covers fit correctly.
B001B79AVG|4|Bought two of these for a couple of my Saab 900's, quality looks decent, but it'd be nice if they didn't cheaply spray paint the whole unit, but that's probably what people want, gotta have it look like it's been rebuilt!
B00FOOV40W|5|Just what we needed, and a great price :)
B001VYX3DU|3|Order came quickly, and fit my 89 chevy truck pretty well while also covering the wheels.<br /><br />Would have given 5 stars, but the cover does not have an antenna cutout, which means you either have to leave part of the front fender out in the weather or cut a hole in it yourself. Doing this could lead to tears if not done correctly.<br /><br />I would still recommend this cover though. Very durable feeling and great price!
B00KX9U3SW|5|I am very happy with this purchase. I finally have air conditioning in my van again.
B008P17RPC|4|I like them
B006RUJ2D8|5|Good product; timely shipping.
B00ABW7U6Y|4|Fits great, looks good ( not quite oem but acceptable )  and works but the mirrors no longer tilt down when I put the car in reverse like it used to.  I'm new to the car so maybe I pushed a button that disabled that!  I do believe most of the people that have trouble with the switch not moving the correct mirror for the position it is in are installing the switch upside down, possibly.  but it is a $10 switch.    I also wanted to point out that negative reviews stating it didn't work could also mean that the person did not diagnose the faulty power mirror problem!
B00DP4ZHL0|5|Bought this for my daughter, I'm always trying to get her to run with me so she thought this was great! Quality is good and it gets a laugh from everyone!
B006FUT0CS|4|WORKS GREAT
B004XOO442|5|I needed a reversible fan because of the serpentine belt driven system on my small block 350. Cured my overheating problem right away.<br />Moves plenty of air and is very quiet even at high RPM's. Will eventually probably go with electric fans but this cured my overheating problem quickly and cheaply.
B00OGN85UO|1|Put both rear axles on 5 minutes in trying them out one broke it was malfunction sent back didn't get paid for had to fight with Amazon to get money back.
B005JDSSP2|4|Good deal
B00PQ7Z0BQ|5|Use this attached to our pet bearded dragon to help find him when he's out in the fenced back yard. It's light and has a loud beep. Will be using one of the spares for his new brother arriving shortly.<br /><br />Comes with four batteries, one for each finder which is nice!<br /><br />I'm visually impaired and can think of lots of uses for this. Great product, very happy.
B004SFKJIQ|5|Great product!
B003TAB6Q0|1|Looks dazzling and blingy initially but the stones/crystals fell off a couple of months later after I installed it.
B0011WNPJY|5|Must have for Ford.
B0015RGQKK|5|Great ow dust, no-squeal brake pads. Have good stopping power and fit perfectly.
B00TJRMX0K|5|All good.
B00HJD4DRC|2|Normal bulbs appear to be much much brighter -- Disappointing
B00NSGH70Y|5|awesome product still works great price
B003TTL0TE|4|buy two for both hands
B005345MFQ|5|Exactly as described and fits great. Can actually ride without it sliding or flying off! Will be buying more in different colors!
B000P0M8AU|4|There is more white space around the main Rangers printing. However can easily be trimmed. Overall sticker diameter is 3&#34; however the main portion that's important is more like 2.25&#34; in diameter. It worked perfectly where I wanted to mount it though. So that's why I gave it the 4 stars. It is Very very reflective, of great quality material. It is difficult to place if you don't have experience with placing decals on cars.
B008QXZ6Z2|5|5 star
B008LY5HWS|5|received the product fast,  excellent product and transaction, will definitely buy from DB Electrical again
B000C2GF32|5|Works great.
B0037W38K2|3|The extra large is loose in the shoulder armor but the large was too tight in the stomach.  Love the high vis!
B00826OVWW|5|Excellent creeper/shop stool. Very well made and comfortable.
B00CO85970|2|i took the chrome to my people in fort wayne,indiana and they had a terrible time installing them. Now mind you these are professionals who have been in business for years. also i think one of them is coming loose already. I just noticed it while pumping gas today. Very disapointing. sandra mitchell
B007LICL56|5|LOVE IT
B002E39XXG|5|Perfect fit, easy to install. Very Happy
B009EK71PO|3|Not an exact fit
B007TYB42S|1|Mis-advertised, once I bought it and found out that it didn't fit my truck, then the merchant changed the advertising and blamed me for choosing the wrong product. Of course, I had to pay for return shipping too. Not impressed.
B005EKY1EM|5|Great charger every one should have one
B000CAINDE|5|Works good on daughters Toyota Camry (2000 model)
B00FM1CKK0|5|I love it and so do my passengers!  Whoo hoo!
B009XJARD4|5|I have been trying for a long time with a jack and other techniques to break the bead.  They did work eventually, but it was dangerous, the rim got damaged (the jack pushing a dent in the rim), the car got damaged, it took ages, or made me really tired.  I also used the bead breaker from a Sealey TC960 - Tyre Changer, but it did bend after a while.  After some research online I bought the Beadbuster.  It works like a charm.  Just read the manual.  The price is worth it, because it will stay in my toolbox for a very long time.  I also recommend the Roughneck 64470 Tyre Lever 600 x 32 x 11mm (to get a grip on the tire) and the Stanley Wunderbar.  The Wunderbar is the only tool I need to install the tire on the rim and a lot soap.  A rubber mat is also handy to protect the rim.  I have used the items on 16 inch alu car rims.  Be very careful while trying to re-seat a tire bead safely.  It can be done with a lot of soap and some air pressure from a bicycle pump (use the pressure meter). Don't lean over the tire, stay away from the tire as far as possible.  The safest way is to install the wheel on the car  before trying to re-seat the tire ( no need for fire or ratchet straps). You have got only one life, so be knowledgeable before doing this.  Google for tyre bead failure.
B004RCV08S|3|Thin, cheap material
B001DUK484|5|works well
B000C2Y0SO|5|Great product.
B00G620ZVU|4|aux light great
B006V3YJZW|5|good quality
B000EQU15Y|4|I wish this switch would operate a little smoother but it works just fine.
B005CRE2K0|3|As a 20 something year old woman, I still as an adult am very much so still in love with Hello Kitty. I love the design of these seat covers. They fit on my car seats, but at the seams the fabric is coming apart. I didn't get the chance to put them on until a while after I got them, but it just shows the &#34;life&#34; of these seat covers. Yes, I am in my car every single day. But these covers should be able to last a little longer than that, and not come apart so easily.
B0015PTV0Y|5|fits perfect for my 2002 Dodge RAM 1500. Like the looks and installation was a breeze!
B001GN0XDO|1|It was tiny and expensive. It was a little bent when I received it.
B007JS3I28|5|Awesome plate
B00Y1HT2ZC|5|Very satisfied with this product, wouldn't program through car, had to take to the dealer.
B00FY80XW8|1|The discription is wrong does not include a key and is not pre coded for the  key that is not with the lock set.  does include tumblers to code the cylinder to an existing key but i need a new key as i was trying to change the key for security reasons.  ended up buying a key from the salvage yard so i could code the lock to that key and have my keys with FOBS cut to match.  may be usful if you want to code to your old key but not to rekey your car.  what you see in the pic is what you get do not go by the description as is is wrong.
B000JZYWQO|2|I have a 1998 Honda Civic sedan.  Yes this muffler will fit my car, but I wouldn't bother installing this one unless maybe I was getting ready to trade my car in.  For a few bucks more you can get the Walker stainless steel one which will last 4-5 times longer than this one.  That model is far better in materials and workmanship than this one.
B00009PGNS|5|We bought one of these (not from Amazon, sadly) 2 years ago. It quit cooling, we called and were told to return it on our dime (~ $50 worth) were told the cooling chip had gone bad and received a new one. Just over a year after that, the second one died - the fan still ran but it wasn't cooling again. We gave up on koolatron: It cost as much as our old Coleman and didn't last as long.
B0015GPQX4|4|i tiny bit flimsy / floppy but the tiny cut out in the back for a power usb cord is a nice touch. For the money, its good. I would recommend it since it is not expensive and it is useful. It is soft and holds glasses nicely. I put Cell Phone (smaller S3),  Sun glasses or reading glasses, A few pens and an air pressure gauge. It holds all of that pretty well.
B00063073Q|5|I decided to purchase this for my 97 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0 since I change the spark plugs, spark plug cables, and the distributor cap/rotor.  It seemed to give my vehicle a bit of boost in performance and better idling.  Also, the port on the ignition coil fits the standard harness without the need of an adapter.
B0040IADRS|5|Very well built intercooler. Nice piping. No guide to installation, but it was easy to install.
B0057Y5EFK|5|Quality and value are there.
B00CAKILAO|5|Great heavy duty mat!
B00SS0PVAI|5|Excellent product fast to ship!
B0073MF9JK|5|Fast delivery- Perfect fit!!!
B006GJL6RA|5|Great product and a Fair price..
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Purses big or small, Purse Pouch holds them all! Larger purses can nestle into the Purse Pouch like a hammock - in FRONT of the pocket. I've been using mine like that since I bought it, and no problems, no spills.  The pocket is great for smaller purses, umbrellas, books, etc.<br /><br />Edited 8/23/15 - I am attaching a picture of my purse in the Purse Pouch. My vehicle is a Chevy Suburban. I purchased my Purse Pouch when if first came on the market, and it has been a God send. It is also easy to access while driving if you need something. My stuff was always falling on the floor on the passenger side - no more!
B00K6DNFMG|3|Sturdy.  The directions aren't great, but as long as you recognize the brackets are labeled &#34;P&#34;, &#34;P&#34; and &#34;PC&#34; for the passenger side and &#34;D&#34;, etc. for the driver side, it goes really quickly.  Do not drop one of the bolt assemblies inside the frame, they are tough to extract.  I recommend installing the thin plastic keeper on the fixed bolt before you insert into the frame.<br /><br />Once installed with all the bolts loose, only then do you tighten the brackets to the nerf bar, and after that the brackets to the truck.  Once I had the brackets tight to the bars, I was unable to tighten the brackets to the truck without having the front of the driver side bar touch the quarter panel.  The passenger side cleared by less than 1/4&#34;.  In my mind this defeats the purpose of a nerf bar.  Any damage the bar might experience would be translated direct to the truck body panel, which defeats the purpose entirely.  Sure they look good, but I took them off and returned them.
B005FR30NW|1|Wrong part.
B000HCKO0C|5|fits perfect
B000BTFBWM|5|Handy little straps if you've got a trailer with e-track. Lets you use conventional hook type straps with your e-track, once you have these, you'll find all sorts of new ways to strap stuff down.
B004O5IDHE|4|This works great for multiple types of bikes...no need for adapters.  It needs more padding, we are going to put all the black ones that came with on one set of poles and use a pool noodle over the other set.  I also like that it comes apart, it makes it easier to load, and we can easily store it in the van or garage.  Do wish it had a secure option for the back portion, other than locking all the bikes together.  One other con, it sits low, so you can necessarily see it though the back window when there are not bikes on the rack.
B000GV10ES|5|Great seat!<br />  Fits my Shadow ACE vt750 perfectly.<br />  Looks great and I love the studs!
B000VUC51G|5|Got this for my husband's new Tacoma. He's been using it nearly a year and loves it. He hauls equipment in his truck bed, and the mat hasn't torn or broken in all this time. He recommends it.
B00KVOI0GG|4|I give it a 4 because the threads were rusty. Took about 30 mins to install. Came packaged well and other than the rust on the threads it was in good condition. Arrived on time, exact color and product as pictured!!
B000DCNG2O|1|a very bad ad way over priced they show a roll when in fact they sell it by the foot
B001IDGR96|1|Li order the  passenger-side mirror and the passenger-side mirror came and everything was good had the Backshell It had the right mirror objects seen closer than whatever this one come and you could move the mirror with a touch of a finger the mirror looks like a house mirror n there's no backshell
B00AVW15NI|5|God Product I recommend !!!!!
B00BTLEIIY|1|Not the best product. The material was very poor quality.
B00EV64BMC|1|The keychain broke within a month. Total disappointment and waste of money.
B0009IQXCC|5|works well and lasts
B006GLA8TA|5|Easy installation and looks great!
B005OURT5A|5|My original had a leak that caused low fluid and an overheating scenario in my trans.  This caused the reverse sprag assembly to break.<br /><br />This new OEM trans line was a perfect replacement.
B0010E1LYY|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B000OV31M4|5|For the bigger job. Works great so far
B010NL3EIK|5|Well made Toyota part. I just got these installed in my Corolla LE (which does not come with steering wheel controls). They work perfectly! Makes my wheel look more modern and less dull. I could keep my focus on the road. I normally drive on highways, and it really helps to have these controls on the steering so that you don't take your eyes off the road.<br /><br />ONLY CON: The buttons don't light up in the night making them a little difficult to decipher which button is which, but you can feel the buttons. On the bluetooth side, the &#34;answer&#34; button has a bump and the  &#34;hang up&#34; button has a depression. The same goes for the other side with &#34;track up&#34; and &#34;track down&#34;, and &#34;volume up&#34; and &#34;volume down&#34;. You pretty much have to memorize (which is not much the memorize) and feel for the bumps and depressions.
B00BHM9Y8Y|5|Very nice plate
B00HQYTUYA|5|They feel good against my neck... There is no shedding & they do a great job of protecting my skin...
B000KITSMI|1|DOES NOT FIT 2005 Ford Freestar. Seller should provide accurate information. I am sending it back.
B00HV0RUVO|1|Not worth ur money
B001AWLTX4|3|Eh... I guess it will be ok mowing the yard with,  wouldnt want to keep adjusting this thing doing 70 down the highway! Quality is good i thought it was the sleeve type, not velcro.
B00062YW7Y|5|The auto meter products work great.  In past 10 years, I have replaced a variety of other supplier gages with auto meter.
B000C57LFK|5|As always a great Monroe product!
B010OT6FX2|4|Haven't really used it yet. It is set up and installed easily. Satisfaction with the quality and appearance. Looking forward to the convenience of the backseat organizer.
B00RAHZDBC|5|Great look on my 2015  Busa. Would recommend to a friend.
B00RVUGJES|1|I only received one!
B00YIA2VH8|5|It's wonderful and cute. Wonderfully cute!
B000RNW5NK|5|Ultimately didn't fit my truck 2003 ram 1500, but that was my mistake. Great build quality and an awesome price.
B000VU9D1G|5|Very nice.
B007TG7IJY|3|They fit my 2012 Camry XLE perfectly and were easy to install.  The drivers side (which is this longer one) chatters and squeaks the first time it rained and I needed to use them.  They were inexpensive though, and they cleared the window nicely, they are just loud and annoying. The shorter (passenger side) seems to be better.
B000IZ1CNQ|1|Chinese junk. smoked melted and reversed polarity on my starter feed the second i plugged it in. So i just dusted of an old rusty run i had lying around worked great.
B00869A60G|5|classes and very well made
B000BRCKTG|5|No problems...they're filters
B001FCB4JS|5|This is good for boat and camper fittings.Stays flexible and adheres. When it gets hot it reseals itself.
B007M2Y1FE|5|Excellent price and fit my 911 perfectly
B0012TPVC0|5|A must have if you're an MC
B0037NVKRO|4|Fitment was good and price was right.
B000HDLQ58|5|fit was great,works well.
B004M09N0C|5|These were perfect party favors for our Casino night.
B000C9WLM4|5|This fit my 1994 F250 4X4 with a E40D.  The filter looks just like the OEM.  The filter has the longer return pickup for the 4WD E40D (deeper pan than 2wd).  The gasket seems nice and thick.  It fixed my leak.  I used about 7qts of atf to refill my pan because i did not drain the TC.  There is a nice guide with lots of pictures on fullsizedbronco.  Google E4OD transmission fluid and filter change
B00M1Y3NL6|4|Only use Chrysler approved ATF +4 in Chrysler vehicles that specify ATF +3 or ATF +4 - use of any other fluid, like Dexron or &#34;Universal&#34; ATF will result in a unhappy transmission and an unhappy owner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many Chrysler transmissions fail after their owners get a transmission &#34;flush&#34; from the local monkey lube and a universal fluid is used to fill the transmission. These places use additives that supposedly &#34;tune&#34; the universal ATF for the application, but many transmissions - especially Chryslers, are very sensitive to the fluid and will not work properly unless the proper fluid is used.
B000CSGT64|2|I used this housing for a CAT filter on my diesel truck.  It works, but I was not impressed with the machining quality on it.  There is a lot of loose flash on the inside of the housing that you will want to pick out so that it doesn't contaminate your fluid system.  Also, the threaded nipple wasn't straight.  When I tighten the filter the seal just touches on one side but the other has about a 1/16&#34; gap.  Luckily I was able to tighten it down to the point that it didn't leak.  Also the 1/2&#34; NPT ports on the side were tapped very deep.  When threading in a barbed fitting it threads in so far that its just barely tight before the hex part of the fitting hits the housing.  Comparing to a similar housing I had from Parker which had none of these issues.
B0110CO95S|3|Don't expect to have 100 amazing stickers, I only liked about 20 of them. I gave away the rest. But I was happy with those stickers enough to make it worth it.
B001O7PNXC|5|good stuff
B00F5MU5YY|3|Does the job but kind of flimsy.  Easy install but the hose is plastic.
B00DFMP8F2|1|Doesn't fit 07 A4
B0089SZQMM|5|Good parts fit dodge caliber awd
B00FLFZCBQ|3|Good quality part. Took forever to ship (4 weeks).
B00EDQ2EM4|5|The original equipment at a good price.  You can't find this electronic strut, the same as the one you're taking out, at any of the dealers or parts stores anywhere near the price I paid here.  Installation was smooth, but it helps to have a good strut compressor.  The struts on my Suburban were so hefty the made the strut compressor I rented from Advance bow out while compressing.
B00110P8QY|2|Very cute! However it fell apart after a few weeks and immediately the item came with TONS of painful plastic pieces sticking out so I had to trim all of them down just to touch it. Unraveled after one wash. Great fit for a large wheel but sadly I had to toss it after a month.
B00725WTRI|5|Great addition to my leather vest I have one of these patches for all my bikes!
B00R85445C|3|It was a fairly good, but not perfect, fit.  I had to get out my utility knife and hack a whole in the left side of it to accommodate protruding parts on the seat for the backrest adjustment handle.  Thankfully, my hack job is not visible due to the plastic enclosure that covers the area.  I just don't really like the idea that I had to cut into it at all!  I'm hopeful that the X cut I made doesn't cause it to tear from normal use over time.  It was also overly pricey in my opinion (for what I would consider mostly FAKE leather), but if you have trashed crappy &#34;leather&#34; seats from Ford, what are you gonna do?  ...there just aren't too many options available.  I will probably order the passenger side seat next.  Once installed they do appear to be OEM quality in fit and general appearance.
B00CG5RYEW|5|Awesome sticker! Very funny, & they sent me two instead of one!!
B007PLZGO2|5|I've had this on the exterior of my car for months. Never peels, fades, rips, or puckers. Easy to apply and a high quality material. Highly recommended.
B003AOKF5S|5|Installed in my 99 Cherokee along with a new timing chain. Jeep is silent as ever now on cold starts and runs amazing.
B00JWAE29Y|5|Very bright great price
B002ZBWKAU|5|Great feature as the unit shuts off when the proper pressure selected is reached.  Mine works great!
B008O70R2M|5|Local auto store does not carry this anymore.  Glad I found it here. I use my wiper washer a lot.  When I first used this, I thought I mixed it wrong cause it was kind of streaky.  After a couple of seconds,  it dried super clear.  You also save by mixing your own.  Lasts a long time. GREAT PRODUCT!
B000N3CP7A|5|Just like the one I took off,works Great!
B00PLWRS9S|5|Exact fit
B00HJ15C88|3|Great design but to narrow for a Texas plate.
B001KS8I32|1|Even though it state's so it did not fit my 2007 Tahoe LT. It is a 2-pronged bulb
B005DNGKLM|5|Haven't used them yet but they look like a quality product
B00UCKVOIA|5|Excelent product
B010V254AW|2|scratch easy and finish is not the best
B0046BWUWA|5|They look nice
B00S2099IY|5|Boyfriend loved it. Got dirty in first couple days on keychain but he thought it made it look more rustic. Great choice.
B010PUUI1K|5|A tire gauge comes in handy and should be used at least once a month to maintain proper tire pressure. Unless your vehicle has integrated tire-pressure monitoring, a reliable gauge is a necessity. This is digital with a backlight which proves useful at night. Based on the box, it appears to be a generic vendor product. In fact, I’ve seen similar gauges in national stores; typically on a rack near the men’s section. I’m not sexist, blame the retailers.<br /><br />Included on this 5-1 tool is a glass break, seatbelt cutter, flashlight, and red LED. I have not tested the glass break or seatbelt cutter. If I find a volunteer, I will be more than happy to test those two tools and update this evaluation.<br /><br />Personally, this is something I'd just leave next to my air compressor in the garage. I can do monthly air checks quickly and fill tires as needed. Remember to follow the vehicle tire settings by looking at the sticker on the door jam on the driver’s side. For the price-point this unit works fine. It is plastic, so a couple big drops and you may be kicking your tire vs. checking its PSI properly.<br /><br />This is a semi-generic product with multiple vendors.
B0085IDD0S|5|Great
B0014KQJ1E|5|Bought this to use with my CDA-9855 and it works like a charm.  It is actually daisy chained off my XM receiver (where I removed a KCA-420i iPod interface) and I had to remember/figure out how to enable it in the head unit but it has been working great for me.
B004HII1G6|5|They are great looking on our truck  would highly recommend them
B00Y90M9X8|5|Exelent
B00VATON4E|5|Great graphics
B0054HNPDS|5|Good quality. Great price.
B00GHT8NM0|4|Works good easy to install. Not one of GM,s best designs. I should have probably bought 2 as I know it will break again.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Good product, we like that it's adjustable and easily sticks to the window.
B000C5G2KU|5|For all you Spec Miata racers out there who drive around with a spare hub/bearing assembly in your parts bin, you should have a couple of these too.  Cheap enough to carry one or two spares.
B00OBWB6WY|5|as described, no issues
B00GR2W7AG|1|Disappointed with the quality. Poor colour and detail. Not worth the money.
B00BT7WQ3C|5|long lasting.. love them..
B0009IQZH0|5|Great
B007Z8VG30|5|What can I say it's a sticker and its greek
B0049GLGF4|4|I bought this for my 2002 lancer es and it's an excellent replacement for the oem one. The only problem was the 2 top left mounting holes for the fan housing. The mounting holes are set a bit low so in order to make em fit, I had to drill holes on the fan housing to match the height.<br />Aside from this the radiator has been working great with no issues and yes it fits oem radiator cap.
B00G49DUJY|5|Great
B00PGC99XQ|5|Good pads. Measurements were spot on except for the underside screws.
B000C9I4AM|5|everything Excellent
B007DMBQSS|5|Good
B00ATPCXVA|5|Looks great on my car! Doesn't fade and was made of thick material. So glad I bought it
B00IOU1BPQ|4|I have used this part for over two months, at first I was not a fan, the engine noise at high torque low speeds was a bit overbearing, however after the ECM made its adjustments it wasn't as bad an know gives a throaty tone that just makes the engine sound like a V8.  No real increase in MPG however the big change was the throttle response off the line, really quick and nimble with no delay when you hit the peddle.  It was easy to install, only took 40 min.
B0068C9HM6|5|My cbr600rr looks awesome, it roars
B002OI3SNW|4|good fit
B001SG8Z1Q|5|5 star
B002R0ASEE|5|Great product! Very good fit and came on time.
B002MW6HRO|5|As described.
B00D1GZBT0|4|Stickers were shipped and arrived in a timely manner. Quality of the stickers seems good, and application was fairly easy. Directions were clear and easy to follow, I used both of the wet and dry method of application, and the dry method was faster and easier. It's pretty easy to get the stickers on without air bubbles if you take your time. The only reason I give it four stars is because the stickers do not match the factory stickers exactly. They are close, and from a distance he won't be able to tell. If you are applying over old stickers however, just be aware they will not match exactly. Final product is pretty dang good. Would buy again.
B00DKDFVVC|5|This company's products all work wonders on my sailboat! Much better than anything marine stores sell.
B00QXZ0NOO|5|A nice replacement for broken BMW candleholders in the E39 cars
B00HN361NM|5|Works great!
B000CB3Z54|5|item as described
B00CB22V7K|5|Excelent product
B003YMRO82|5|Great brake rotors that fit and perform as good as the original equipment parts.
B00T66EY74|5|Great fit and color (Gloss Carbon Grey).  This one I've purchased from Chrome Supply is much better than the poor fit one I had bought from eBay.  The key pouch is [[ASIN:B013HY9FJ2 Leather Keyfob Holder Case Chain Cover]].
B00M229MIA|5|Works perfectly
B00GBONC68|5|Have used this item on other cars they work great and take less than 10 minutes to install.
B00AHJOM1C|5|Looks so good on my car! Easy to apply as well. Definitely recommend it! :D
B00DCBS38A|1|The scent actually made me ill.  It smelled nothing like the honeysuckle that grow here in East Tennessee.
B00GIZZGLO|5|Just as advertised, Perfect fit
B00A14QNP6|4|It's exactly what I ordered, fit good, only complaint is the window switches are a little stiff.
B0028PJ10K|5|Life savers!  Great, easy item to level your rig.  I had a camp site with a large drainage ditch that I needed to get over to park.  My drain pipes would have dragged so I built a little ramp from these to get the trailer into the site.  I think 10 is a good start but will be adding another 10 to have for those sites that are really un level.
B00BITI522|5|Put this into my 2000 Prizm.  Took five minutes to install, at best.  Works great.  Worth the couple bucks.
B000RXNLK6|5|gets the job done
B007MCZZ86|5|Product was a direct fit. Part worked perfectly, as expected.
B000HZRTDE|4|Good
B006EI7IAM|5|as described, no issues
B0022ZUUPG|4|Was as expected. Shipped on time
B001LQL5UG|5|I installed this on a 2012 Duramax. I'm not sure why the parts stores list it as a factory part for the diesel when it's the exact same sensor used on the gas engines they do have a listing for.<br /><br />Just a quick installation tip, have a drain pan ready. You're going to lose about a half quart of oil when you pull it out.
B00M04KNDI|5|I didn't have 2 original keys, so I had to take these to the dealer for programing after I had them cut at the local hardware store. they worked great and we're all set.
B0010GG7YG|5|exactly as described, delivered ontime and worked like new
B00E9FSSRO|4|Used on a Toyota Venza: Did what I paid it to do at about one third the cost of what dealers wanted.
B007OW6MD6|5|Great price!
B00O0HZLZS|1|Paint did not match and clear coat was horrible. The spray can had a horrible spray pattern.
B007BKFY30|5|After reordering I found my purchase to be excellent.
B00DUFC974|4|Great cover for the price. I wish it fit a little more snug, but better a bit loose than too small. Very easy to use, just get a couple long and durable bungee cords and you're good to go. It's nice and soft on the bottom side and durable and water resistant (not proof) on the outside. It definitely keeps the scorching, damaging sun off of my car.
B00067BV6Y|4|Much whiter color than my standard Halogens which is what I wanted; would have preferred 4300K to 4500K color but that was unavailable. One of my H1 halogens burned out so I didn't wait to drive around with only one headlight, and I wanted to try these.
B00I5LCEAA|5|I purchased this item for dishes in our motorhome.  The non skid bottom keeps them in place and the dishes are easy to remove for use.  I would purchase them again!
B001A6VN72|5|Great product at a great price.
B00CMX20H4|5|It sounds great and annoys everyone
B000CIPUR8|5|yup, it passed.
B00HWIALWU|5|Good
B000PSMVTA|3|Worked great until I go to a curved (tight spot).
B0013HFWYS|5|Quick delivery, thank you for a good price too.
B004GCVW7S|5|Fits perfectly thank you amazon the price is also fair.
B00T02O0W8|5|Fits great!
B00BGGYVXY|5|great
B000CM3I1Y|5|Moms car got side swiped And had the mirror knocked off. The housing was OK so just had to replace the glass.<br />Perfect fit. Warning though, the double face tape is strong. It is a one shot deal. So make sure t is lined up right before pressing in.
B00G6UE3LK|5|works great.
B008NDGSHA|1|Pure garbage..cheap stickers on a plastic plate...the roundels dont fit correctly at all...do yourself a favor and buy elsewhere...pure garbage
B00N48KZ4G|5|Work great
B004EK0E5S|4|Fit good.  Just a little off color.  Old dash is faded a little
B008U1IBO8|1|Did not make any sound difference even with my flow master exhaust, fell off in less than a week with normal driving.
B005FIHDN4|5|use whatever TP you want with this stuff just use enough water.
B001AWLJG6|4|Excellent product,install with ease in my toyhauler,good quality, recommended for all you motercycle enthusiasts.
B004S7YAR0|5|They work great!!
B00NLMD574|3|received my product, every thing was perfect until I realized that the string was missing.......
B00S58ANDI|5|perfect fit.
B0002ILK2C|5|Installed the battery in the trailer and checked by activating the disconnect to see of the brakes would work once again.<br />The brakes are working well again should the trailer break loose..
B001CA9CGU|5|Perfect!<br />Exact Fit for 1998 Ford Ranger 4.0
B00080QHMM|5|This is a very good pressure guage.  I have a second very accurate gauge to cross check this one against, and this one is right on target every time.  Great product.
B00OVB7LGA|5|Cut it down and fit perfect
B00G3BTV5A|4|The grease is dark red in color.  It is on the thin side but sticks nicely to metal surfaces.  The tube has writing on it but it is not in English.  I think this should have been noted on the product description.  Product seems good so far.  I will check it again in a few weeks to see if the grease stays where I put it and also to see if it breaks down or not.
B000E347M0|5|Excellent it needed not additional parts to install and is working perfectly!  2 Weeks Later and Still working great!
B00DUGSOJ0|5|Very nice. The local Dodge dealer was able to program this easily and they even were able to cut the key at the same time. Works great.
B0007Y4P9G|5|We lost the side clearance light lens cover on our 1999 Thor  Motorhome.  This replacement lens fit perfect!
B000BVRZ74|5|We all know what this is.... just Saved me a trip to the auto parts store
B009DIWCDS|3|The subaru is a little loader.  No directions, hope I put it in correctly.
B00AOAFP9C|5|I have only used the pump once and with the small tube provided it took about seven minutes to empty 5 gallons of diesel fuel. I will try again with the 10mm hose provided and expect the time to be greatly decreased. The pump works great and I am very satisfied with it.
B00NX6PGYS|5|The are really comfortable and durable, its a little tricky to install them without a helping hand but once they are in you will love them, besides look at them, MINIONS!!!
B008D26PRO|4|Liked it, but can't be found as an XL anywhere.
B0007ZG9TO|4|must be prepared when you are ready to use this!
B00MV1JYMG|4|Great
B00GNR2XKY|5|Perfect sharp looking fit on my 94sporty 1200.
B006EGAIII|4|These are mostly ok.  The major issue I have is that my truck is very heavy compared to these ramps, so unless I have sandbags behind each one, they just slide before I can drive up them.  The anti-skid bottom is no match for my truck, apparently.  But, once I am on them, they hold the weight just fine.  They stack for easy storage, which is great.  I do wish they were a little wider, though, as my tires tend to stick off of one side.  But, they are wider than the steel ones I almost bought and hold up just as well, so all in all, a good investment.
B005VTSWW8|5|Works Perfect! Thanks
B00ASY5PIA|5|After immediate installation, car still was leaning, got car towed to Mercedes and they couldn't find issue. Car had fixed itself after running for a bit. Company was awesome in shipping asap as I requested!! Will be ordering a second for passenger rear.  Update: After less than 2 years, my car now needs another new spring, same side while the old OE passenger side spring is still holding strong. Not happy.
B000BPLNXC|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. Had a longer reach so I can get the top of my small SUV.
B003YDY7YK|5|Well built.  Plug and receptacle ends are molded one piece and sealed.  Cord is flexible.
B006P88TJ0|5|Good quality, well made and great detail. The back has a thin, clear, plastic like coating on it. I wouldnt say the patch is heavy duty but the quality is very good. The patch doesnt have velcro on the back but you can easily put 3M sticky velcro on the back.
B0023VBP1C|5|Great and fit my Saturn prefect.
B000KYYM46|5|Very please with this Rav 4 replacement key. I took my vehicle to the dealership and they program the key for me.
B00JQ4FMEU|5|Perfect fit fast s/h and great price A++
B000E2AR5C|2|Neither gasket included with this filter fit my 1997 Triumph Tiger, despite the website saying it would.<br /><br />Next time I'll get a OEM filter.
B0002V9LAW|5|good transaction. Can arrived quickly (small dent doesn't affect performance) and this stuff works great! Thanks!
B005Z2JGL2|5|these are excellent, I held off because i couldn't figure out how to remove the map light, but it was simple, just snaps into place and pulls out, same with trunk and license plate, great illumination too
B00496MAWC|1|It is what it is. Fits my 2002 Chevy S10 perfectly.<br />UPDATE 1JAN17: I have purchased 5 of these E filters now and two of them have leaked at the seal and one was EXTEMELY difficult to remove. I have one left and I can't wait until they are used and gone. My local parts stores only carry the E filter now too. I look forward to purchasing a non-AC Delco filter for future oil changes. AC Delco should have left the original filter alone as I never had one problem with them. Jerks. Extremely disappointed.
B009FNX2EO|3|Received on time but was damaged.
B000KRQ0TS|5|They worked great
B00A1AX1VE|5|It's perfect. It's sturdy and doesn't come lose in the car wash. It looks so much better than the stock one too, especially because it says TRD
B00029WVIS|5|looks good on my car
B00UJ5YNYU|5|I don't know much about light bars but my son does.  He says that this is a great light!  He does off-roading and mudding and uses them on his truck.  He was very happy with my purchase.  Easy to install and dependable.  I bought this at a discount for my honest opinion.  My son gave it thumbs up!
B008TTD2TU|5|Wish I had found these years ago, great in every way.
B000CP86ZE|5|These splash guards are just like factory ones!  They fit my 2015 Spark LT like a glove!  I would recommend these easy to install guards!!
B00LISFFBC|5|Thanks its cool
B00PE2BH3S|5|The ashtrays R cool! Love them!
B008KOA332|5|Had the key cut and programmed, Works great nice to have a second key again.
B008R95GA0|5|THE TONGUE OF THE EXTENDER WAS JUST A SHADE TOO WIDE.  I HAVE A 1999 INFINITY Q45.  DID NOT MEASURE THE FIRST TIME, BUT YES, I WILL MEASURE FOR ANOTHER SET.  THANKS FOR QUICK ORDER  PROCESSING.  ORDER #108-4465374-0425062
B006VFEJJQ|5|Replaced the factory battery in a 2005 Prius, fit no problem. Also this is $100 less then at a local parts store.
B009FUF6DM|1|Impossible to clean glass without leaving behind lint.  And I don't mean light particles that can be flicked off like with paper towels. I mean persistent, almost sticky fibers that won't come off without scrubbing with another (real) lint free cloth.  Even tried running them through the washing machine first.  Just terrible.
B002UIW65C|5|Good odor absorber. Not a strong air freshener smell but absorbes odors to eliminate bad smells.
B004FVTU1A|2|This mat looked beautiful online and it is but distorted size.  The problems is for a mat is that it is too thin, too soft and will snag for an outdoor mat and wold serve better as a picture so don't think I'll keep it.
B005NIKOUU|5|Good stuff.
B000P72ES4|5|It's great
B001OCXI2U|5|Much better than the j hooks that came with my UWS crossover tool box.  No play and line up perfectly, I used these to secure a UWS slimline low profile tool box #TBS-69-SL-LP-BLK on 2015 F150 King Ranch
B00E9W2PPS|5|Exactly as advertised.
B00AKH0BS4|4|good clamps
B0079XC0Y0|2|Bought in September 2014, only ran for less than 2 months.
B00752TRNW|5|Just plugged it in and everything seems to work great.
B000C7VYMY|5|Good product . ..good seller
B007RW19YA|5|Worked great
B0002JMUY8|5|worked perfectly with my 1996 f-250 7.3 power stroke
B00TY5SID8|5|Si Yuus Ma'ase. I ordered one for myself and as a surprise for my sister. It is just as described and arrived at both our addresses even before expected!<br />I received an apron and t-shirt as a gift from your shop and love them still. Keep up the great products!
B00KVC78RU|5|We love the lights. It gave the car a nice new look.
B0065G36WW|5|great product
B0041R50XK|5|Great helmet. The built in visor feature is a must.
B00DBEQK7Y|4|A bit low on light power (lumens) but within expectations
B000O09VPG|5|The exact same replacement. Plug and play.
B000C11JSE|3|Replaced the driver side motor on a 1993 F-150 XLT 2-door.  Installation was fairly straight forward using [[ASIN:1563922134 Ford Pick-ups & Bronco 1980 thru 1996 2WD & 4WD Full-Size, F-100 thru F-350 Gasoline Engines (Haynes Manuals)]] for instruction.  The provided screws worked great and replaced the hex screws that were used in a previous installation.  The provided wire that connected direct to the motor was also the correct connection to the installed wiring, no further wiring/connectors needed.
B001DRI5LA|5|Easy to install.
B00L4OE3O0|5|I have gotten so many compliments!!! Love the set! I had to have help to install the seat covers.
B00LNOTM0G|5|Great led driving light replacement. Match the color my Hids in the headlights.
B0016KABFC|5|Works great draws boat right up on my trailer!
B00J7RB72M|5|It is a lot easier to carry my CD's in this case than individually. Thanks, well made.
B005OVM1KC|5|The fit was perfect just like the original that I had until it failed.this replacement was packed nicely<br />And neat it would of been nice if it had instructions for the do it your selfer.but otherwise the over all experience was a 7 out of ten scale.saved a lot of money from avoiding the dealership it would of been a lot of $$$$.
B00K53DSZ6|5|This battery fit my 2010 Kawasaki Ninja 250r<br /><br />This battery is designed closely to the OEM battery it was replacing and was the same dimensions and weight as the original. I had no trouble installing this battery, the screws were even included. The original harnesses from the bike fit perfectly and I was able to start the bike with no problem at all. No leaks, funny smells or residues from this. Please do recycle your old batteries. For the price under $30 this is a great bargain.
B007Z8VG30|5|Great
B000E71BNO|5|Direct complete assembly replacement with 2 uncoded keys. Dealer coded for under 40 bucks and I was on my way.
B00065L2D8|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B00ONGXKMC|3|The sensor was smaller than original. Using it would have caused oil leaks. The vendor was willing to correct it.
B000MQ6BYQ|4|Great product, sitting on a 1972CZ250 vintage motocrosser.
B0031I20CE|2|meh. too cheap for real protection. just use it to keep dust off.
B00USCUZ0A|5|Very good quality
B003BL1H0M|3|Works great but a few LED lights stopped working about 6 months after installation... Also, the bar built moisture inside the &#34;tube.&#34; The company was really easy to contact and got a replacement easily.
B00620PXMW|4|Has done the job very well.  Only problem is that hose is very short.  If your fill point is on top it is fine but if hard to get to them purchase a unit with a longer hose.  Also this does not have a temperature adjustment like other more expensive gages so you need to keep the package that has the table for pressure adjustments for hot or cold days.  Basically you just fill it up at the bottom of the green sector when outside temperature is cold and at the top when hot.  I have used on four cars without a problem.
B005CREADY|5|Looks great will give it 5 stars.  Will be back later with another update if they don't hold up.  So if you don't see an update from me then they are good to purchase.
B000S0KY80|5|I already own a B&W 5th wheel hitch, and was so impressed with the quality I ordered this item. All American made, and the best quality out there.
B0061X4S5S|5|Nice
B00JVP667G|5|Very nice replacement ! thank you, these work and look perfect - also they were packed very well
B00144BIC0|5|Nice
B000C2SIMS|5|Still the same great quality that they've always had.
B00D42AFS8|1|Verry bad use it once and it almost exploded on me it got very hot and it got fat like it was going to explode<br />Very disappointed.
B01093QDWQ|5|These are wonderful. They give a lot of support and are small enough that I move mine from car to car.  We use them at home, work and in the cars. My kids even use them while doing their homework. Great product.
B001AIZ5HY|5|This headlight lens restoration system worked wonders on my 1997 pickup truck's headlights.  The lens had become foggy and were not giving good light. The process did take longer than the instructions indicated, I worked several hours over a couple of days.  The process wasn't hard, just time consuming. I am so pleased with the results.  Headlights look like new!
B008HMBUDY|3|These goggles aren't to bad. I use them for motorcycle ridding. At night they aren't bright enough, so during the day is best to wear them. They get really foggy, but then you start going an they defog.
B00U868BN4|5|good product
B0010GK3SM|5|Perfect fit.
B00HXCIA32|5|Great product....priced right...has 17mm nut for easy installation and removal...gained about 3 lbs in oil pressure.
B002UBZJQ2|5|Met my stringent expectations.....
B000E7SY16|5|good product
B000JFNAAS|1|Does't fit standard thread 1/4&#34; or 5/16&#34;! It must be clearly shown in description. Wasted money.
B0068FYKVQ|5|Fast shipping. Exactly as advertised. Haven't used it much yet so I can't comment on the product except to say it is nicely chromed and fits perfectly.
B00D3HZYUS|4|These look good and offer good protection, but they are WARM and not breathable at all.
B006B2XKHQ|5|Just right
B001VQDNA6|5|Excellent fitment.  Easy to assemble, everything went into place without a hitch.  The packaging was superb and the exaust arrived in great shape.<br /><br />It's very quiet, but has a good growl when I get on the throttle.  It looks reasonably adult when installed, not very &#34;boy racer&#34;.
B001OK6Q2Q|5|Goes great with the aftermarket carb I bought!
B00EP3PX2S|4|I live in NC, ordered on Thursday, and the bars arrived the following Tuesday via Fed Ex. Came from California via truck. The box was slightly damaged from handling at the different Fed Ex hubs, but I made sure everything was ok and all installation parts were in tact before letting the driver leave. Driver's side nerf bar was bubble wrapped in green and the passenger side in clear. Hardware supports(3 each side), and bolts were color coded in plastic in a sealed container the same as the bars . So far so good. Easy to remove the Toyota bolts. Takes a 12mm socket to remove the old, and a 13mm to install the new bolts. However, I ran into a minor problem, more inconvenient than anything. The manufactured had the nerf bars mislabeled....the driver side was actually the passenger side. That slowed things down about 10 minutes. The whole installation took about 45 minutes. The bars look great and were a nice addition to my truck. As per instructions, I put a coat of wax on them for weather protection. I gave the product a 4 because of mislabeling and having to remove the mislabeled bar. Otherwise it's a 5 product.
B002W7XDIU|5|As advertised.
B00M9DCMNE|5|exactly what I needed
B00DX87WJI|1|I think you guys need to redesign this you said it fits a 04 crf150f. It doesn't the kick starter hits on it. You also need to work on your customer service. I left several messages and no one has returned my call. This could be a great product with some tweaking.
B00VZO35QG|4|Only used 1 set so far but it works great in 5 feet of salt water!
B000GU5JOQ|2|Look great on my 750 Shadow, but rubber keeps popping out of place. I will try some glue.
B00V9IVIGW|1|Product does not work; will not fit as designed. Still under dispute with supplier
B00CZDQU3G|1|NOT DIE CUT. JUNK LOW QUALITY CRAP
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Fits my Ram 1500 perfectly and it folds up small enough to hide under my seat. I'm so glad I finally replaced my old accordion style window cover.
B001974S06|5|did not get a chance to try it, had a hard time removing the old one from underneath my M3
B00D8QE112|5|Wipers fit perfectly and work great. It was my first time replacing the wipers and they were very easy to install.
B000C83Z4I|5|Very nice fit and looks to be high quality.  Got this through Amazon for half of what local stores wanted for exact same part.
B00KOAX42C|3|Good Design, Good Workmanship, Quality Materials and they work Very Well
B002SAUY74|5|Genuine Toyota part. Easy to install with great quality and security. Very good price on this also.
B00QWVROIC|4|So far so good<br />Love them
B000JKORIW|5|These fit my 01 Toyota Vienna perfectly and were very easy to install. Unlike most products, these fit within the window track decreasing the chance of loosening.
B001G9KC1G|2|Would not buy it again. Doesn't really clean unless you scrub it. Motul is much better.
B0019C17H8|3|Didn't fit exact but with a heat gun it's perfect
B00DDV6T5I|3|Had to do some trimming, and the width could have been cut a little wider. Managed to get them looking good with more patience and time than I originally anticipated.
B00U1Y14NM|3|I am actually very pleased with the product itself though it does not come with instructions. I installed in a matter of an hour. Very straight forward installation if you know what you're doing. I am unpleased with the sound. It makes a highpitched wistle at idle that almost sounds grindy and is very bad for first impressions. People look at my car like a dead cat when I'm idling the parking lot. At acceleration, it sounds good but a little too loud for my taste. Just my warning. I will be sound proofing the fire walls in mine.
B004I15M14|5|Looks identical to OEM.  Way cheaper!
B000BUOSGG|4|It's so small, it's cute. It doesn't take up the whole counter. Only buy if you plan on using as a single person living alone or in an RV and need to conserve space.
B00FY0S61Q|5|After driving on the freeway behind a tar truck that started leaking tar all over the road, Tar X was able to remove all of it from the car!  I tried the spray and hose off method, but there was simply too much tar on the car.  I had to use a microfiber towel to wipe the tar off and then threw the towel away.
B00290YD2U|1|I bought this for my exboyfriend a so in giving it one start because my exboyfriend is one star but the lanyard was dope!
B00TSV244C|5|Great
B00144CZE0|5|great
B00192JFI6|5|Easy to install and does the job.
B001THVNCM|5|An amazing product!  I have personally used on boats and cars, even tiles in my bathroom! Holds up well in the Florida sun, guarding against UVA rays. Recoating after 3/4 months is effective, and in some cases obviates the need for another coat of wax.
B00LQESGE6|4|Nice and bright
B0049ETJF0|5|My 2005 GT cruiser was bringing up a emission evaporation code.<br />After further research I found out that there is a high possibility that is the gas cap.<br />I found this part sold by mopar.<br />brand new, fair price, it does come with the tether<br />and was a perfect fit.<br /><br />2005 GT cruiser<br />2.4L high output turbo.
B00DHVJK4Q|5|USA all the way.  Awesome pin and well made.  It has 2 point of attachment on the back
B00F4MGG2U|3|Worked about 9 months and started to fail, flickering at first - - total failure after a year, possibly due to extreme Arizona heat.  Board looked scorched upon removal.
B0015YBYCS|5|These Tire Protector worked perfect and are the best priced I could find.
B005CLMQNG|5|Worked out great
B00D1CQVIY|5|very simple to use harness! highly reccomend. heavy gauge wire, quality connectors, i didnt recieve an inline fuse, but i had one on hand. so no big deal.
B00A8J9PKO|4|Bend a bit too easy when installing but fits
B006A2JGHU|5|Matches all of the Pink with my wife's new Jeep
B003ZS32CW|5|Product as described, fast shipping, easy installation. Flawless process...thank you!
B00GHYDE6A|5|Great collection
B001TFE38A|5|Fantastic ! Very easy to remove the residue and is very durable. Still beads off water and it makes keeping the car clean very easy even after 7 months after applying ! Will buy again maybe next time ill top it off with the butter wax to really make it shine.
B0009IQZH0|5|i was looking all over the place to found these towels. Walmart has a lot of Meguiars products but not this one. I used these microfiber towel to take off the paste wax off my black car and it works amazing. These might seem a bit expensive but trust me it's worth the money.
B00PC5TJ5A|5|great service  quality parts i would recommend this to anyone.
B00I6VTUWY|5|We ordered a dozen to give as gifts. They feel substantial. Ordered this one due to all the good reviews but hopefully will never have to use it.  Everyone who received one was very appreciative.  May not be something you would buy for yourself but would be placed in your car &#34;just in case.&#34;  A  family member is in law enforcement and he said the metal tip is really needed for breaking a window.  He also stated that not only is it good to have if you need to escape from your car it is also a great tool to have in case you come upon someone else trapped in a car.  They arrived on time, in original packaging and were well protected in the shipping box.
B002M5IQRU|5|Just fine
B0057QENLY|5|Easy install my wheels haven't been stolen yet so A+
B00NGOPFE8|5|Extremely easy
B00FGPTBJU|4|Bought this for my '08 jk cause as jeep owners know, there is practically no place to put anything, (wallet, phone, smokes, etc...). Extremely happy with it. Took about 10 min to install. You have to use the new screws supplied with it to re-mount the compass module as the stock ones are too short. If you have the satellite radio, this will still fit. You just have to slightly relocate the satellite antenna which is mounted with sticky tape. Only reason for 4 stars is because the color of the tray doesn't exactly match the color of the stock trim. But, its close enough to where you wont notice it. Highly recommended.
B00BDV8UF2|4|These seat covers were alright, albeit ill-fitting for my mom's 91 Toyota 4-Runner. I ended up sending them back, but the customer service was excellent!
B00T54J4AE|4|they fit good and were easy to install. both of them had a small dent in the same spot.<br />looked like it happened in manufacturing. I contacted steel craft and they were quick to<br />correct the problem.
B00823FSRC|4|We have a lot of rocks, sand and seaweed to cross to get our kayak into the water. It handled that very well. The only problem occurred with the snap on the strap. If you pulled it really snug it would pop open. Also, when the kick stand is open, the part that you set the boat on is at an angle rather than flat. Not a big problem, just a little annoying. Over all I'm very happy with the product, but I will buy a different strap.
B007QBD4TU|5|everything Excellent
B00F1FKQXK|5|F150 2006, XLT Triton 5.4 L. Installations was very simple. It makes under the hood look super sweet. You can here the difference when you Rev the engine up. More Torque and More Horsepower definitely.
B0084UJ04A|5|They fit!  NICE!  I ordered these for my 2004 F250 Ext Cab and they fit like a glove.  The color match is spot-on and the piece-of-mind of having my carpet protected is worth every penny.  Just GET THESE, you won't be disappointed.
B005IGSOJU|5|These are genuine yamaha,they are real leather.Nicest out there,far better than the others on the market.If you want the best,buy these.
B00D3290EO|4|Great value and durability. Both driver and passenger side mats stay in place. The back seat mat comes up a little short but that may be due to the type of vehicle used in; F150. Still a great buy when compared to the &#34;other&#34; brand.
B00IO98A56|5|07 mkv GTI fitment on this kit is perfect!!!!  I have been using these now for a few months and they feel great the car wants to stop on a dime this is definitely a high quality setup just by the look and feel of everything so needless to say I will continue to use these and will recommend to anyone with a mkv GTI so everyone keep calm and DUB ON!!!!!
B00RW8560M|5|Really great product. Above and beyond customer service. The small fits my Honda Elsinore 175 perfectly. I'm pretty happy my bike will be a little more protected now. Should have purchased this a long time ago.
B00480J4PU|5|they work  and they came earlier
B007GGJLWY|3|The mounting did not fit on my 2002 Acord LX. I had to use the existing mirror base, the price was good.
B00R6S0MEI|5|The hose nozzle performs exactly as described. It is a solid built product.
B00540RHMU|2|Doesn't stick very well
B001AVSIOI|5|solid, strong
B000CMKG6E|5|Good product!
B000BRRHZS|5|My motor couldn't be any happier!
B00AYA3Q0M|5|Well made and fit great!
B00CGTVESK|3|This cover works well enough, though I'm not thrilled with it. For one, it's not leather, which you could divine from the price and the reviews--but you shouldn't have to. More of an issue is that I doubt it really fits most steering wheels very well. It makes my 2001 Prius steering wheel quite big and leaves a half-inch gap in the middle most of the way around. This is just the nature of a cover that isn't laced, I guess, but having used those in the past, this one's disappointing and I hope I don't have to clean too much debris from the gap over time. At least it is snug, it feels pretty good, it doesn't smell bad, and the price is right--thus the three stars. And I no longer have to clean my hands from the disintegrating steering wheel.
B00FH8P1DG|3|Plenty bright but leaked a little around the gasket when I pressure washed the truck. I recommend using silicone to seal it up before installing
B00SWJ6TOM|4|Got me out of a couple jambs at sea when my batteries would not fire up my Yamaha f250 outboard  New batteries now but won't travel without it.  Charges my iPhone and other gear fast.
B002TIR892|3|The chrome color is pretty dark compaires to the chrome colors in the car. It's not the bright chrome we regularly see in cars. That's why I didn't like it that much since it doesn't play along with the chrome color in the front grill of my Lexus CT 200h
B00U36ASNA|3|PARTS LOOK GREAT, BUT DON'T FIT QUITE AS WELL AS THE ORIGINAL PARTS, NOT QUITE FLUSH.
B0046DQTQQ|5|Awesome frames!  Got matching tire caps for this also
B00APM0AKS|5|Cheap and nice to have around - otherwise you can break you TPMs, ask me how I know.
B007ZDIXY0|4|Very simple to install, I just took my old corner lights off and used the same screws for these lights. Car looks much better with these matching corner lights and gave it more of a JDM look
B00OLP4I9O|4|Works great.  Fits my RDX nicely.
B000XY1A1G|5|Best I've owned !!
B000M2QQUO|5|Good quality!
B00HS0GTNW|5|Direct fit, good paint, fine build quality, and good packaging. These are not performance struts so don't expect any gains in cornering ability, but they are great replacements.
B000GV6SK4|2|I'm giving this review two stars not because the bag is bad, but the product description.is incorrect.<br /><br />Amazons product description<br />T-Bags largest rigid roller bag<br />Glides smoothly on high-quality ball bearing blade-type wheels<br />Sturdy telescoping handle disappears into its own hidden pocket<br />Convenient cargo loading through a full front opening<br />Expandable mounting system adjusts to fit all backrests 7in to 14in.

B00891DIF6|4|Came with everything I needed.  Now more drips behind the toilet.
B001DKUTR0|5|Fine product as-is. It does the job
B00823FSRC|4|Worked as expected on a 12' recreational kayak. I didn't notice any bad smell from the tires so maybe that has been fixed. The strap that came with it is pretty useless unless you are on perfectly flat ground. I used a ratchet strap wrapped through the dolly to really hold the yak. I was able to take it down a steep rough river bank to the water without it coming off the dolly. Be careful going sideways on steep terrain. If your hand is in the tow loop and the boat flips over as mine did you can get injured if you can't get your hand out in time.
B000CIUF5K|5|Works as advertised
B001C6NL52|5|I am a retired auto tech.  I have always had an issue with keeping sockets upright in my toolboxes for easy access and to save space.  This product seems to be the answer to my problem. I am very pleased.
B004IARKDI|5|Great product and a Fair price..<br />2014 F-150 : Looks awesome
B00EKTJHCO|5|Just as advertised.
B000WJC7Y6|5|It's a cap. It fit.
B0023VOXIO|5|Great buy and easy to find the Right parts..
B002ZTGLCK|1|Very hard/stiff line. I would not buy again. The line from motion pro is way more pliable/bendable. application was motorcycle fuel line
B00PZDTZT4|1|Very bad quality.. Came with a lot of scratches..
B00BFE61HG|4|skeptical on if it would fit and it would work but the fuse fit like the old one did, and haven't had any issues with it the month ive had it installed into my 200sx. only complaint is the price for tiny piece of plastic and a dab of metal
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Looks good and appears to be made of good quality. Will go on the back window of my SUV so we'll see how long it lasts.
B0015YD3AY|5|This fits our rv spare tire nicely.
B010PWSDEW|5|Great little lights! I haven't installed them yet because I need to get a push bar to put them on first but I have wired them up to test them and they are great. Super bright and a decent field of light. The casing is super durable and really seems like it's going to hold up to just about anything I could run into on the trail.
B001G64710|4|Good fit.  Quality is mediocre...what you'd expect for the price.
B000O8462Q|5|Good product fast service
B002U729UA|5|Great product!  I have been using it for years.
B007S0LDME|5|Great Stuff! I tried EVERYTHING I could get at the marine stores and this puts them all to shame.
B001CF1A7O|4|I wanted one for a 2.5&#34; Hitch (Ram 2500) but this one will do. I will need to use a 2.5 to 2&#34; reducig sleeve (which came with my truck). It's solid metal feels great. You will require a hitch pin. Not sure how the paint will hold up but my intent is to keep this in my truck as an emergency.
B00CUO2BXS|5|Order received when promised, beads pour and flow easily through the bottle and tube included with the order. Do not rush the installation of the beads; continually tap the tube and the beads will very slowly flow into the valve stem. Do not pour too many beads into the tube at one time. Do not completely remove the valve stem valve when deflating the tire until air pressure is gone or the valve might be blown away and not be found.
B00K71W938|5|Great fit, looked great on the pickup.
B004A32UK6|1|Cheap
B00ZY2AE6E|5|Love these pads, they take all the pressure off my elbow in my car. Great size, not too big and they are super easy to move.
B010N7RW2S|5|The Anker 600 jump starter is like dynamite. So much bang in such a small package. Performs better than I thought it would Jump started a car that had been sitting for 3 months. Charged 2 iPads and still plenty of juice left. Here is my video enjoy. https://youtu.be/kmfQdbGOjv0
B000NPDL76|5|Worked for testing a vehicle I suspected of having a bad head gasket. It was nice to know for sure that I DID NOT have a blown head gasket! This tool is sensitive enough that you can literally blow on the fluid and it will change color due to the Co2 in your breath.<br /><br />Out of the container, my fluid was green. I found after the first attempt to use it that it was bad. While this was disappointing (especially since I was out of Amazon's return window before I figured this out), I contacted Uview directly and their response was better than expected. They had an excellent support staff and they were quick to replace it for me.
B00480J4PU|5|Works perfectly. Not too blue, more of a soft white color, which I like rather than yellow. Easy to install works with my 2000 Kawasaki ninja 250. no complaints.
B0001EXKNY|5|very easily attached and looks great.
B00U075ARG|5|great
B00LEBLI82|5|Nicer and brighter lights for about 1/10th the current the incandescent bulbs drew. Switching out these bulbs made a HUGE difference for our camping experience.
B002R0R38S|1|Installed this assembly 10 months ago.  It is full of water/condensation.  Outside Amazon's return window.  Spend your money elsewhere.
B00FRHOI86|3|I've always used Latitude blades on all my cars but this last set has let me down a bit. They shake and squeak on lower speeds. I am constantly lifting them off the windshield because they randomly leave streak marks. Not sure if I just got a poor quality set, or if they are cutting back on quality.
B00V2VF5GU|5|So far the lights are awesome. It's bright for utility purposes like back up light and for bikes like quads. Haven't really soak it to see if moisture builds. The mounting bracket is easily bendable which is a plus and con in itself. I would again.
B00LSTO43Q|4|Works great.  Easy to install and operate.
B00DL6T2YK|3|Didn't realize air would not hold after you took off the valve stem
B00FQ0ROZS|5|I am very pleased with these. Bright and compact.
B006BVK7DM|5|Fit the rear of my 2007 R1200R perfect.  Much cheaper than OEM BMW pads (must be made of gold...retail is over $120 a set for pads!!!) and they work as well if not better.
B00BZSE5CK|5|If it fits, it sits and sits it does.
B000GTTJM0|5|came fast, had it programmed and away we went
B00GNU1TUQ|5|Nice fit on my 74 Chevy
B00Z7KIZPA|5|LOVE IT! I have bought several for gifts.  You can just rest your purse on top of the pouch which is a bit like a hammock  (which is what I do) or put it in the pouch. Either way it holds my purse securely and conveniently.  Definitely a girl's friend!
B00H9S71LW|5|Yadda yadda yadda.
B002E3V9XI|3|under this blue cover is all grease. not even a tight seal to keep dirt or mud out<br />not very protected.
B000S2RYZE|5|Easy install - perfect fit - corrected my weak braking issue.  My 99 3/4 ton Suburban missed the recall.  This was the replacement part.
B0002ILK72|5|Great replacement for the weak battery in my Kawasaki teryx.  Size is different, so I had to pick up a universal bracket from pep boys, but my bike starts every time, with no more dead batteries and flickering headlights when using accessories.
B009V04CEK|4|Took an extra day to arrive but when it did, I wasn't able to set it on my own. I went to pc richards and they set it in 5 min. It works but the only issue is the settings are all messed up. I have the lock and unlock, automatic start and trunk open features but the alarm feature is not working. But I think its because it wasnt set right. So I'm going to have to go back. But im happy that it works great. It feels strong in my hand and I love it. Another thing is that the button on my old key fob was yellow and this one is orange which makes no difference. Still works.
B000FW2NEY|5|all was good
B00QRHDIPY|5|Works great. It has odd power connector and cables not that long.<br />Works great so far. it maintains my chassis batteries on my RV.
B0028ZKMM6|5|Buying an aftermarket horn? Buy this, as well. Motorcycle, auto or truck the application is the same. Built well and with an easy to understand wiring diagram, you'll have your horn installed quickly and the quality will shrug off the perils of driving conditions.
B00MUF1APW|5|HOLY S*%T these are bright. They are a great quality product, will buy again! NOT a cheap Chinese knockoff like others I have purchased.
B00F5YW6VW|5|Love these mirrors. The work great on my SUV. Very slight distortion on edges but just exchange until you find a set that you are comfortable with.
B004O844DS|5|Good product, was a little small for my 98 Blazer so I also installed the cargo extension and its perfect now. Install is straight forward, tightening a few bolts and mounting to the cross bars that are on the roof rack. I also ended up buying another for another Blazer, so I have two now and love them.
B0092P19T0|5|Fit our Escape perfectly.  There is a little white logo that you can remove with alcohol.
B00PTVU7UI|5|I put this on a 2014 Teryx 2 seater. It fit like it was made for it and made a huge difference in the amount of dust in the cab!
B00JRYHJZY|5|Best ball mount
B005VKLGUW|3|solid build. didn't end up being what I needed and the tools that came w/it are horrible.
B00WH6M9OU|5|Great
B00CWA09TS|5|No more scratches or cracked paint at my door edge
B00HS5LDX8|5|I've been using the brakes and rotors for about a month now, and so far so good.  I like how smooth it feels to brake.
B00BAKMTG2|5|Awesome cleaner
B00FRM6ZFK|5|Right part and timely delivered. Thanks
B004GCBE1C|5|Fits perfectly on my 2000 Honda Civic. Got here about 4 days before the expected delivery date also so that is awesome. Thank you! Awesome buy!
B002F4SOAC|5|Quality was great and great on time delivery
B00P179CW4|5|Purchased for use in 2013 Mazda CX-5 2.0L Skyactiv-G.
B00L5PO33O|5|Very nice quality.
B007TG61TW|5|Very good gloves.
B00MYEY4ZC|5|Worked great. Great price and fast shipping
B00LTKF3E8|4|The product works as advertised.  This was my first time attempting to recharge the A/C myself and if you haven't done this before I would highly recommend you do a search on your specific vehicle to correctly identify the LOW PRESSURE AC valve.  In my case, my 2004 Dodge Ram and 2006 Expedition have high pressure AC valves easily visible as I open the hood.  Thankfully the connector is different else I very well could've hooked this unit up to it by mistake.  I had to go online to learn the correct low pressure valve that you hook this unit up to (very easy BTW) is located near the firewall where the AC hoses are returning to the passenger compartment.  The hose attachment and pressure gauge are easy to use and seem to be of a pretty decent and reusable quality.  I think I've seen the recharge cans available without the gauge for the next time I might need it.  I have to take off 1 star because it appears the can seal is permanently punctured when the hose/gauge is screwed into it.  So now, I can't really discard the unused portion of the can in good conscience without releasing refrigerant into the environment.  So, I will have to wait til the next time I need it, use it up, and then go onto the next refill can.  I screwed the thing down tight, but I can't help but think refrigerant will leak out if stored in my garage for a year or two?  Would really have preferred they use a valve on the can and I'm actually a little surprised the EPA would even let it go to market like this.
B011JA8BVE|5|I was skeptical at first as I've never heard of this brand and you never know with these things.<br />So far, this car charger works quite well.<br />All 4 of the ports function at their advertised output, which is actually quite a bit faster of a charge than several of the store bought wall charges that I have laying around.<br />For comparison, it charges slightly slower than the stock OEM charger that came with my Galaxy S5, I'd say about 80 as fast, which is still really fast for a car charger. Construction feels solid, and it fits in the car power port without any wiggle. I received this item at no charge in exchange for an honest review.
B004VTF25O|5|Better then expected easy install no problems<br />Very brite
B005G21JP2|5|Easiest
B004B8GTQG|5|I wasn't expecting much considering that the foam-rubber seals on a 35+ year old car are just plain OLD. With minimal to loose, rubbed this on the seals and let it sit. Washing the car is just an exercise in mopping up all the water that gets inside so squirting water around the doors and windows is minimized. The following day I opened and closed the doors and it didn't have that usual rattle. Looking at the seals, they swelled up some. Being brave I splashed some water around the glass and it didn't get inside. Still hesitant to squirt it with a hose though nice that it did make the seals feel softer and look a bit puffier around the glass.<br /><br />Also had applied this to two other cars and one has been sitting outside for the past 7 years. Noticed that after two days the door seals had also swelled and closing they sounded almost as more like &#34;foompf&#34; rather than a a dull &#34;thump&#34;, hard to express the sound difference. Driving it I want to say that I didn't hear as much wind noise from the side mirrors. Very slight though.<br /><br />Overall very happy.
B001VXXUWK|5|Great Fit and Provides great protection
B00LAFAXVK|4|reflective and easy to remove for when the new driver is not driving :)
B00B0F8182|5|Bought this for my sister since she loves Doctor Who. She loved this episode so I bought his this decal. she loved it so much she could wait to use it.
B00192JFBI|5|Easy to install and does the job.
B00936PB60|5|These go well with promaxx wheel covers for ford fusions. Look just like oem.
B009436GDO|3|Unfortunately these are only Jeweler's-grade pliers. I had bought these in order to install a steel press-in PEM nut in a tight corner of aluminum without further scarring an alodine finish. However, after the first application, the plier jaws bent backward and are no longer parallel.<br /><br />A close-in examination of the black-oxide jaws reveals a semi-circular cutout milled out of the inaccessible portion of each to account for that rivet hinge point. And these are FLAT rivets - the cutout did not need to be made all the way through, yet it was, which added a perfect stress point in which to bend the jaw backward if enough force was applied to the tip. And this force was achieved by my bare hands.
B00NFJP576|4|K & N has been around.  If you know anything about their product then you know what i am going to say.  Great product.  You must follow directions with the pre-oil spray to be effective in dusty conditions.  I am using this on my Razr 1000 in the dunes and on trail riding.  A must one time buy to eliminate paying $40 for paper filter over and over again.<br /><br />TMB-VEGAS
B003SS62PS|3|While mechanically and electrically it works fine, it fails to make any difference unless its an inch away from face.....the flow is simply insufficient....then again I live in an area where its really hot in the summer (yesterday was 105 outdoors and my in-car thermometer showed 118)
B00ERK03V0|4|Difficult to set on the wall, however beautiful when it's finished. Looks like I painted the letters on the wall, and it looks great!
B006GHQE1K|5|Quick to install with no problems.  No splicing or cutting, just snap the connectors in and bolt it all back up (about 90 minutes).  I installed on a 2009 FZ1 and now have much better visibility, even in daylight.  I had someone ride it it so I could see.  The light is easy to set with included instructions.  I set mine to flash when using the brakes.  Also the yellow LED turn signal is safer than the tiny after market ones common with fender eliminator kits.  As of the review ridden around 2000 miles with no issues from the light, including a trip along NC's Outer Banks complete with sand blasting, scorching heat and sea spray while on ferries.  I've also been caught in two torrential down pours, no fogging or apparent leaks.
B001G8AIMU|4|very good!!
B00JR572XW|3|It don't sound great. The sound isn't so clear. You can find another that it adjusts to your needs.
B000C2S92M|5|precise fit
B00FBPM5WK|5|Very durable product.  I have one indoors in a high traffic bathroom,  and one in our garage entrance into our home. They can be vacuumed easily, and cleaning is a breeze by hosing down with an outdoor sprinkler head! Would definately order this product again!
B009II5DMK|4|Nice small size portable 12V battery - works as advertised. My only issue and its minor is the built in &#34;clips&#34; (for the red/black power) - when attaching to charge or power a device - do not always stay on. That is the &#34;price&#34; you pay for a a &#34;mini-sized&#34; battery but that is fixable as well.
B001UCDFDQ|5|good ceramic pads. comparable to $70 one at auto parts store.
B007IQFJ5U|5|simple enough for my kids to use and effective. they both had bikes stolen before we got this
B00NXDA088|5|A+
B00P9R8PPG|2|The seat is comfortable, but the strap came off after a couple of uses.  We stapled the strap back on and it soon came off again.
B006IZZUB0|4|Pros:<br />They are easy to use and hold well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Unlike other models, these are use-one-throw-away. If you have access to the underside of whatever it is holding, you may be able to recycle the clip, but otherwise, when you punch the pin down, it keeps on going inside the body work. If it hadn't been for that, I would have given them 5 stars.
B00R5R8CNS|4|They fit my 2011 stryker pretty good they come from china so shipping takes awhile.
B010Q4GSQY|5|Super in love with it, especially since it's so hard toonfind &#34;Ursula&#34; products
B00652G4TS|5|Great Tool, every car owner should have one
B001C7RTCW|5|Used to seal cowl vent hats on a 67' Mustang and worked great.
B007S0LDME|5|THE BEST! no smell!
B0006IX7YC|5|awesome
B001F02NCW|5|Ive had more people stop me asking where I got it they Love it
B00651CLCS|3|Love the look of the antenna.  Signal is greatly reduced though.
B000PA03AC|5|easy install, BMW stereo recognizes the additional input immediately
B006X8AT5Y|1|Mount broke as soon as I got it it looks nice but the bolts don't hold tight it's build is very flimsy the bars bend easily
B00AV2F23M|4|Overall a great experience but I ordered the white jugs and received the red ones. Not a huge deal.
B00RKMUT0W|5|Great product
B000NS71H4|5|It appears to be the right one based on the old part.  Not installed yet due to other parts needed.
B00THK6GKC|5|Exactly as advertised
B000C9FI8S|5|good
B00JWDDUF8|5|Great product. Had a defective one and got sent another. AWESOME CUSTOMER CARE
B000CIQ5DG|5|The village elders still speak around the campfire about a time with automobiles were equipped with things called &#34;carburetors&#34; which were Byzantine contraptions designed to atomize gasoline for mixing with oxygen at a stoichiometric ration of 14.78 to 1. Legend has it these devices were perched atop gasoline engines for many moons, but were wiped out by the dinosaurs around 1982. There are still a few carbureted engines among the villagers to this day, but most suffer from a myriad of problems, including a proclivity for &#34;vapor lock&#34;, a condition that my old Ford Bronco developed on the high-mountain passes of Colorado.<br /><br />The elders told me to latch on to one of these Carter P4070 electric fuel pumps, and I did so in order to curry favor with the village council. I installed the Carter as directed, knowing that it's PSI rating was perfectly inline with the requirements of the carburetor. I installed a fuel pressure regulator to give me a bit more control, but I don't think I really ever needed it. Afterwards, the Paleozoic Bronco churned up those 13,000-foot passes like a asthmatic rhinoceros, no longer sidelined by the spectra of vapor lock.<br /><br />Easy installation, not too noisy, rock-solid reliability. Make the elders happy, and slap one into your junk today.
B00F3FJPPI|5|Great product
B00C0SQ8KG|1|I was looking forward to this light so much. And when I got it I instantly started running all the wiring and I put led lights together. And we'll it sucks because I was only able to put one side of the lights stand and I was unable in the other side because there was no track to guide the hex screw in the slot.... I feel so disappointed. I've been trying to contact seller and they haven't responded I'm so aggravated I'd like to be able to try they're product and possibly get a second chance to see maybe it was just a bad light. But I don't know if they will consider that. If they can't even reply to my emails. &#34;What a great seller they are&#34;!!!!
B00O9R16SU|5|Great product! Worked perfectly!
B00HZSNV4C|5|I had 8wk. worth of bugs on the front of our RV. In about 1hr it was all clean.
B004P1YMRC|5|took awhile to get done even after watching video everyone recommmends. common sense helps, take your time.
B005OO7CCQ|5|Nice to have a tinted view when sunny and bright!
B001AVU36Y|5|Cheap steel sprocket, fit my 2006 klx250s perfectly.
B008968SAG|5|Product came quickly, but was poorly packaged. It got wet in the mail. Thankfully they still adhered after drying out. Also I expected them to be bigger. Other than that they were cute little decals
B00M9NJGMO|1|Not what I expected .... Not worth the time to ship back
B00P90QS5W|2|Does not fit 84 Magna without replacing the tube and extending the wires. Nice lights.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|“Works as described. Used it to clean leather recliner. Goes on easy. Buffs off after prescribed drying time. Looks like new.”
B006OB0A3G|3|The panic button sticks out of the FOB.. I ended up just putting my old panic button back on.. disappointing...
B00MWH72IW|2|If this cover was listed as &#34;water resistant&#34; I would probably have given it 5 stars, but it was listed as &#34;waterproof&#34;.  This cover is NOT waterproof.  I needed something waterproof, this is not, 2 stars.<br /><br />That said, this cover seems pretty decent for your typical car.  The material is relatively thick, water resistant, but also breathable.  During our last heavy rain, water penetrated through the cover, but the water under seemed to dry pretty quickly.  For the price I think this is a very good option for a breathable/water-resistant cover.
B00MQ5Z5F2|1|Confirmed fake from Antigravity's customer support.  The genuine product worked so well so I decided to get another one, but this time I got a fake product.<br /><br />Fake - glossy black<br />Real - Rubber like matte finish<br /><br />You can easily see the difference between fake and real packaging from the picture.
B001DKV5H8|5|I use Pro Long products in any combustion engine I have!  Boat, Car, Truck and even an air compressor!  My 1999 Silverado Pick up has 430,000 miles on it and I have used Prolong engine and transmission products since it came out of warranty .
B002GP87NO|5|Perfect
B002FYUO2I|1|The lights are dim...nothing I do seems to change that.
B009UZ1TE2|5|I don't know if I'd call it Wash and Wax, but it does an excellent job on light cleaning while buffing up to a real good shine. Great for quick touch ups and other like applications.
B000C5449G|5|Moog is the way to go.
B0026JK8GE|5|good product
B00IZ9ZD5U|5|Worked like a charm and delivered fast!  Would buy again.
B005ZH4GO4|5|Great product. I just wish the rear mats came with locking holes.
B00KBKOAGY|2|I bought two of them, one for each car. The visors have a lot of distortion. One of the brackets broke from the heat because the car was parked in the sun. I would not buy them again.
B007Y7YMNI|4|Nice price, nice starter. Only issue is the connector for the starter wire isn't located in the same position as the factory starter, requiring some re-routing of the wire harness to reach.
B00BDF9CQO|5|The Chemical Guys hit a home run with the clay block. Easy to use on vehicles with minor paint imperfections. I must have in the cleaning arsenal.
B00062ZX5O|5|This product is what Auto Meter said it was. Fit great. Thanks
B003YMTJ9O|5|Bought an old 1992 Jeep Cherokee Laredo and the pads and rotors were garbage. The rotors were completely torn up, WAY past the time for replacement. I installed these rotors with new pads and the Jeep brakes fine now.
B00G620ZVU|4|They work great.... I did what everyone said to do and put clear silicone around edge and never have a problem with these lights.. Very bright..
B00108G6TK|4|Fits Tacoma PU perfectly. Same size as OEM Toyota oil filter. I am sure it does its job well as made by Denso.<br />Addendum: Only filter that has similar dimensions as Toyota OEM oil filter. The dimensions of all other brands are much smaller.
B003NBFKDK|4|For the price, this is a steal, but it is a bit on the wobbly flimsy side. Don't let that scare you though, this handles everything I put on it like a champ! Carried my grill and my bike on this thing and it was rock solid! easy assembly and easy storage in my garage! Had to deduct a star for flimsiness! Would recommend!
B00W2XFFJ4|1|Cheap made they won't stay on the car
B0002F66I8|5|We love this cover. We received today with anticipation. It fit perfectly on our ATV trailer's mounted spare tire. We are very satisfied with this product.
B00BNRQSZK|5|Nice shirt.
B00J6GXXWG|5|Works and fits great!!
B00JVHLS3G|1|I've had this on my car for about a month and it's changed color from crisp white to goldish color.  Poor material quality.  On a positive note, I guess it was only 6 bucks!  Buyer beware.
B00EC2CA0K|4|Works really well, easy to tighten straps down to whatever tension you might need.  Could use some chaff pads to go under.
B001NYHNW0|4|Good fit, above average quality
B00QY3T6PM|5|Great product for great price, thanks!
B005R4LH92|5|Looks great and install was simple.
B00CXY1FGO|5|Nice
B0034NS9BM|4|These work very well to level our RAV4 when we are towing. The installation is nowhere near as easy as portrayed in the instructions. Trying to cram the bladders into the springs while lying under the jacked-up vehicle was a royal pain. After 3 tries I took it to a specialty shop and they laughed at the instructions supplied. Instead, they removed the coils springs and just dropped the bladders in. Unless you have access to a lift, be prepared for a really tough install, or to pay to have it done for you. Firestone: if you could pre-compress the bladders into a long thin cylinder (with an easily removable compression wrap), these might be reasonably easy to install. Other than the install hassles, these work great.
B00JCHGFII|1|The description said lens; I expected it to have glass. I would like to return it.
B0056YRBW0|5|Just installed these on my 2010 r6 with Galfer wave rotors and the setup is excellent. Very, very pleased! Will update over the long run if need be.
B000M27WOI|5|Have a jeep with a thin from a GM motor, supplies with more than enough fuel. Just be prepared though it is loud but it helps let you know it's working.
B003VTBFBA|5|I've had this sticker on my car for a while now - still holding up well. No problems with it. :)
B000BROATE|5|Hitch extender is solid construction and has a powder coat finish. Would definitely buy again.
B003FCNX2C|5|I think i could see a mile on flat road with my brights on... and yet nobody flashes their brights at me when running standard lights... just bright enough to not be a danger to others but i can see really well.
B00GSAUHB8|5|The sun protector arrived promptly and was exactly as specified in product description. I have a nissan altima with a fairly large windshield for a sedan and it fits just fine in case there are some of you that don't want to take the time to measure. 😊
B004ZBD50M|5|You cant find a better soft top it holds up and stays in place even when being towed keeps the sun and rain out
B007TYPD8Y|5|Bought this to fix our kids window on her car. My husband is not the type of person that normally works on cars but he was able to get it done. The CS support was great, the first one we were sent was broken and they immediately sent a new one, no questions asked.
B000H9K4JQ|5|I'm restoring a 1974 Yamaha Enduro 360 that had a gas tank full of trash, rush and gum... this POR-15 kit helped me clean it thoroughly and seal it after getting most of the rust out. I haven't finished my restoration, but I have no doubt this sealer kit will have me ready to ride in no time.
B0065N0XG2|5|what i wanted & at a good $$$$$
B00S38NDRI|5|as described, no issues - nice addition!
B00UNTU3VO|5|Many years ago I had a &#34;the original&#34; car duster. I remember it working very well, however you could not use it on the windshield or hot metal as it would leave steaks. We recently purchased a new vehicle and I decided to again purchase &#34;the original&#34; duster, however I was unable to find one at the local auto parts store. I ended up purchasing a knock off. I was immediately disappointed as not only did this duster leave streaks, it also left red lint everywhere. I went to the Amazon website and found that others were reporting similar problems not only with this brand, but with 'the original&#34; duster as well! I then discovered the UltimateCar Duster. The reviews looked good and the concept of a different material for the fibers seemed to make a lot of sense, so I purchased one. I am very glad that I did. This duster is very well made and works exceptionally well! I am extremely impressed and elated with my decision and purchase. This is an excellent product! I also received a very nice email from the company, soliciting my feedback, good or bad. This is great customer service in my book and was one other factor in my giving this product a five-star rating. If I had one suggestion, it would be to make the storage bag a little larger in diameter, particularly at the opening. The duster is large and fluffy and you need to take some extra care when putting it back in the storage bag so that you don't damage the bag. This is a very minor thing for a superb product, and after all, you're probably more concerned about the performance of the duster itself, and not the bag!
B00BQYCJKI|5|Low cost and very durable. I personally will not be using it on paint, though. It'll be my everything else towel.
B00JGQLUBC|1|advertised as $16.97 for 5 qt bottle , got charged $26.99 because I purchased 3
B002UJ4WUS|4|Worked as promised, just an effort to get the mix right.  I heartily recommend it.
B006H34BUY|4|Cute
B005YP38EQ|5|Very happy with my purchase
B00Z7BXK5O|5|Me encanto !!!!! love it !
B00MB3IYWK|5|Nice waterproof cover for the money. Fades from the sun pretty quickly but that was not a big issue for us.
B000GTYBZ0|5|Perfect fit A+++++
B0066PI35M|1|Glue did not set up and never hardens to pull out porcelain  good idea needs better glue to work properly ended up buying a dofferent kit to push porcalin in so extractor would work
B00KB76DEY|4|Real simple and straightforward to install. Hopefully they stay in place - seems like they're sturdy. These don't say Subaru on them, but they are genuine Subaru parts because they had a Subaru part number and came in Subaru logo wrapping. The price I paid for these here versus what the dealer was going to charge me was less than half the amount I would have paid if I let the dealer install these in my 2016 Forester.
B00G6KIIH0|5|I get a lot of people stopping me and asking where I got this.
B001FAI9Y8|5|These work great!
B008XNZZ7O|3|ok
B00C10WNMK|5|Fit well on my small four going-on-five year old.
B000Q8GVPY|5|It got the job done on my '97 4runner. Held pulley in place over 200 ft lbs. Finally replaced the timing belt. the 60.00 spent on this tool saved me over 500.00 not having a shop do the work. No breaks or failure of the tool.
B007ZCQD9S|5|great product , as described , great price .  Happy Customer !
B00XKSYXCU|5|Bought these so everyone in the neighborhood would know what a crazy cat lady she really is.<br /><br />She loved it. They are now on the back of her car.
B00C0XDTZI|5|Vary nice ezey to install makes my dodge ram look higher love the product
B002EOGPY0|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00306YG3S|4|I use these when I am working with chemicals that require the protection such as with aircraft remover.  Obviously these are not form fitting and not made for grip.  They do a great job of protecting hands and I had no problems using hand-held power tools with them.  The only drawback is that the interior does become fouled with odor after some use, pretty normal symptom of any glove of this type over time and exposure to moisture from hands.
B00LCFDDVU|5|Delivered in a timely manner.  Product quality was as expected.
B00HEDJ7OG|5|Works awesome 80 degrees out on Stevens pass pushing hard highest transmission temperature was 150...
B005LA03OC|3|Fit and work well -however, I lost one already..  may need to look at getting another set for 'spares'
B000C7QGCC|5|Excellent. Perfect condition. Exact fit.
B0032H37LC|4|Fits good. The brackets feel cheap but work well.  Good cover
B008M7SVBS|5|Perfect accessory for your Mercedes-Benz
B001EOV3JS|5|Easy to install!
B001O0CIQO|5|This is OE Hyundai.  If you look closely at the picture you can see the Kia/Hyundai hologram tag.  I took a gamble based on that picture and was very happy to see it was genuine.  I was priced $175 from the Dealer.
B0049J6YKS|5|Perfect fit and super low price
B00NQGDIOU|5|These are awesome; great appearance, fit and quality. I get many compliments on them!
B00MJ438Q8|5|Had to make a minor adjustment for my 94 F250 regular cab diesel because of the front tank but I am very happy with this product. Looks great on my truck.
B001V9V6SE|2|While the light looked nice, it didn't fit my 2004 Softail standard.
B00I3JWJV8|4|these smell great-  the pomegranate and fresh linen had the longest lasting smells though
B000C9444C|5|Exactly what I needed...screw you Advanced Auto Parts!
B001QIUGVI|5|This is a great scanner for the money.  Well featured and allowed me to troubleshoot my truck very quickly.
B002FT3JMU|5|good fit, good quality, it works.
B00HWGX9X0|5|Outstanding !  Beach Graphics Pros do it right!
B00LGYFGZI|5|Just put it on today, went well, pulled from top instead from side, work great.  Looks good.
B00CPYC9BC|5|Works great, and this was the cheapest price I could find
B000CMDEBI|3|Is ok for the price you pay
B00L7TQMJ6|5|Better than average rotors.
B00GX4Y9AY|5|Very nice product.  I can now charge my phone, tablet and jump start a car if I have to. Love it!!
B00QWGVTFQ|4|Just got love the way they look<br />Let's see if they gold up
B00YB99CUK|4|The mirror fit perfectly!!  Great price, and I like the full adhesive!!!  However I would put the adhesive on the mirror first next time!!  Great Value!!!
B001TJ70ZE|2|Product does not stay in place nearly as well as I had hope.
B000GU25XE|4|really heavy..suppresses the sound a lot.. i wouldn't recommend if you are looking to put it on a cafe racer
B00AK7NDL6|2|So, I was led to believe these weren't just 'stick-on' chromed plastic pieces, but that is just what they are. If you were needing to replace the gasket behind the original black plastic surround, this is not the kit for you. If you just want a chrome look for the existing handles, then it is OK. Frankly, the center pieces for the actual door handle (moving part) is worth the price of admission since the pricier kits that have the gaskets and locking surround parts also use a stick-on piece for the handle. I'm satisfied, but not overjoyed.
B00FPT6P5U|5|PERFECT
B000FOYBOW|5|Quick process. As expected.
B009FUF6DM|5|Love them! Durable and washes well!
B00ZTSBCA0|3|smaller than 2001 bumper but worked ok
B00WTODKRU|5|This light bar is amazing
B00BJJZI6W|4|It fit and was the same quality as the one that broke. I plan to buy a 6 pack next time as they seem to randomly fall off when my wife drives.
B00NUIY6XQ|5|I'm in love with this jacket. It's comfortable, I love the little thumb holes on the liner. Not only does the liner zip out (and button and snap) but you can ware it on its own. There are little rubber zipper pulls on all the zippers that pop off super easy. If you want to keep them, I recommend a little bit of glue. If you do not, super easy to remove. The reflective material is noticeable. It is currently still very warm here so I can not say how it is in cooler weather. The side of the jacket is stretchy over the hip area. I ware an XL shirt and got the jacket in an XL and it fits great. I can see it being a bit squishy if you are a busty lady, but that seems to be par for the coarse with anything. Don't worry though if you have hips. They thought about that and fits great. If you are looking for a nylon, classy, breathable, functioning jacket that works with cruisers or sports bikes with out making you look like a power ranger... I can not recommend this enough. The detail is pretty buy not over the top flowery and pink. And it fits like you ride, not like you're just holding on.
B0053HPFDW|5|works great
B00EVVHCC8|5|good product
B00IG0C202|5|works great and the intall was simple!
B00O9ZUQV0|5|This motion light works great. It was delivered very quickly.  The solar panel works really well. It lights up my entire back yard at my camp.
B00M3HYPXQ|5|Very good!!!
B000G156WA|5|No problem with installation.  Everything bolted on as described in instruction sheet. I was very happy to see that it actually fit tightly and only the receiver was visible in the end.  I've notice many other installations and  you can see everything hanging below the bumper. Not so with this unit. It's hidden like my other chevy truck which had a factory installed hitch.
B000M8U6RM|5|This is my second Slime. The first one lasted about 7 years before the battery went out. I looked at other models, but came back to the Slime because I knew it can do the job. This is a solid device that is well built.
B000VKTUD2|5|I can't believe that I paid for the oil change place to replace this!  This is so easy to replace, it takes 3 minutes or less.  Look at the videos on youtube and it's easy.  Great price, it looks like same quality as what I replaced, and it save a lot of money!
B00EVMT6A8|5|Does the job it is intended to do.Eliminates the blind spot plus makes parking easier due to lines being visible.
B00Q7LW2G6|5|Awesome, the part fit and while I was shaking the bike to check for leaks it slipped out of my hand and fell over and didn't leak a drop.
B000BZG742|5|Excellent.
B000AMBOFS|5|A+
B00EW4NPGQ|5|Great
B0000C6F0W|5|very good product..... what I needed..... very very fast delivery.....
B00JWVQAR0|5|Awesome
B00D3RDOKK|5|Bought these coils...they are great my accord sitting Purdy...
B00U8RP7T4|5|Excellent toolkit, I'm getting ready to restore a twenty-year-old pickup truck. I will need to remove door panels, trim and dashboard components. The reason I purchased this tool is because I can remove all these items without damaging them, because of a budget I will need to reuse most of these parts.
B006XH77H8|5|So far so good. It comes painted as opposed to the driver side one that didn't and has now started to rust.
B00AC8BPYK|5|Nice replacement lever. I don't want skulls or iron crosses, not my thing. If you need a stock replacement lever this is a good choice.
B004TO0VLG|5|good $$$$$$
B001JT5OL6|5|clips onto my footman's loop and unclips easy for quick storage, holds a cobra 75 MIC pretty well even bouncing on a trail.
B001EDBEZM|2|When I originally ordered this product I didn't give myself enough time to review it in an honest way. It was my first time making soaps, I did make a pure Castile soap, just a hint of coconut créme perfume, this didn't trace right. I realize this only after using a few different brands. It has been about 6 months now since I poured the first batch, there's a ton of discoloration, the soaps are still very soft and they don't really bubble or sud as much as my other Castile soaps that were made the exact same way, just using a different brand lye. I want to like it, but it's not good quality 99% pure like they advertise. It would be great for beginners like I was, or testing batches, something you wouldn't need great quality for.
B001N2O3PM|5|Very sturdy, high quality license plate holder.
B000I04Z7Q|1|Arrived broken (only one light color worked). Lights were so dim they could hardly be seen at night. Returned for a full refund.
B00CMUD8E6|5|good quality
B00P2D3VZG|5|Great product.  I have used the bulb in the last three of my vehicles. It is very bright and I haven't had to replace one yet. I would definitely recommend.  The price is also the best I've found,  especially the package of two. I have used them in a 2011 328i BMW, 2013 Jetta and now on a 2015 Toyota Tundra.
B00G2KI9L4|2|It lacks the detent to lock the window button into the down position for the driver's window like the original dodge part had.<br />I am talking about how you press down and it locks into position for use with toll booths mostly.
B00B117U0U|5|I am very happy with this sunscreen.  It fits my Avalon perfectly.  I used it recently when it was very sunny and hot outside.  The car was so much cooler than it would have been without it.  No more hot steering wheels.  It also protects the inside of my car from fading.  With the custom fit, it is much more attractive than a lot of sunscreens I see and it is easy to roll up, fasten with the Velcro strap and stow away.
B00HSTRYMS|5|PROUD TO HAVE IT ON MY CAR I LOVE MY COUNTRY,AND PROUD TO SHOW IT
B011JNP9Z2|1|Front seat mats did not fit my 2006 Scion TC like site said they would when I ordered them.
B006WPQNB2|2|very disappointed.  very difficult to manage the weight of water when filling and emptying and if you have a weak stomach don't purchase.
B001TO1D48|5|Works as expected
B000BSYAX4|4|Seems to be of a good quality, the one knock was ease of install.  I had to get the sledge out for a little &#34;gentle persuasion&#34; in order to get it all into place and had to loosen the bumper brackets and put a jack under it to get the two flanges that bolt onto the bumper to line up.  The only lack that I wish it had is the flange to mount my light hookup which keeps getting abused on the bumper.
B005N737P0|4|Alls good but I thought the large cross was going to be on the back...I thought the pic was showing the back but that's the front. There's nothing on the back:(
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Nice
B000GTTYAC|1|crap product, bolt holes off,
B00BO3UBNI|5|Love the fit and design. Great for whatever hits your floor boards. Easiest to sweep out.
B00NHX76LS|4|Everything was great but use my old straps.
B00495UQT2|4|Good product
B00HTP8N0I|3|These are OK but pretty thin, They will work alright i am sure, If you stay within the 1200lb load limit i am sure they will hold up just fine. I have some other brands that are double the thickness.
B00GHRWSUA|5|First time, I chose the wrong color, returned it, received a refund and then chose the khaki. The kit contains everything you need to replace your door handle, thing is the instruction, suck; they mostly say &#34;remove panel, replace handle&#34;. What I did is look for a video in Youtube and that video contained all the necessary info to perform this task.<br /><br />It took me no more than 45 minutes at a very leisurely pace and I have very basic mechanical abilities.
B00IKSN0CE|4|Worked great was just as I needed.
B00SUNHB7Y|5|OPT-7 Motorcycle Kit is the best 3-LED set you and find on market! It include all of what you need with exception to the bike itself and a heat gun. If you are considering cheaper brand LED kits for you motorcycle, DON'T! Save your money, in the end result you'll appreciate the added luxury of an OPT-7 light kit.<br /><br />So many cool combinations you can do with this kit, you can put the light strips almost any where in any position!<br />This kit comes with so many awesomes for its price range:<br />Water proofing heat shrink tubes for the connectors, four splitters to connect all your lights conveniently, many single wire extensions, an extra LED strip for back up, a on/off main kill button that you attach with included Velcro, a ton of black zip ties, a very nice key chain, and remote that gives you even more options!<br /><br />5 (*****) Over all; this kit is the best simple and EASIEST I've installed on a motorcycle or remote vehicle. BRIGHT 3-LED pads on the strips, ton of colors, AND a dimming option; If you are looking to pick up a LED kit, this is the one!
B00KL3ALGO|1|These don't stand a chance in Southwest FL summer. They fall off. They also stick to one another when kept in your blisteringly hot car.
B00D457BMI|5|I purchased this sensor for my 1996 Avalon.  The cost is around 10% of the OEM sensor.  I relpaced it myself and saved about $700.  I have driven around 50,000 miles on it since I installed this sensor.  It still works great.
B002OFXF5Q|5|Works awesome.  My tank is now holding air like it should.
B00HVER23G|5|It's held up great! Looks good. Just make sure you hear set it with a heat gun. I hear of people using a blow dryer and it not staying stuck. A blow dryer is a woman's tool.
B002MQDY4O|5|Excellent. But the clip came installed backwards. Had to take it out and reverse it. Other than that, very easy install.
B00L42VGUG|4|Served the purpose ...
B00DNGEHM0|4|I like the looks of this product, unfortunately one was ruined and you cannot buy them individually and I had to order a complete set again.
B00S9OM0AM|1|The crystals themselves are perfect. My license plate doesn't fit right in the nook that it's supposed to. The covers don't fit the screws so it was a waste to put those in the box.
B00SLT90CQ|5|Awesome product. Fit tight and no leaks. Looks great on my F150 as well
B008EEYWKI|5|Put it in my 2004 Sequoia 4X4 and everything works great after 6 months.
B00UX1Y7H8|5|These look mayve a bit cheap in the picture but they are very nice, heavy aluminum body with heat sink fins and WOW very Very bright, an awesome buy.
B000HBGHRW|2|They rip really easily
B012P87APM|5|Great product and excellent service
B00UCP6HKK|5|Keeps charge very well. Saved my phone from dying countless times. Great capacity. Used for few months and I see no deterioration yet.
B001B6IF6S|3|The glue on the bottom tailgate piece is not the best.  Had to buy a tube weather strip cement to fix it.
B0009IQXFO|5|works well and leave no film
B00RITSYKE|4|for a B8 or B8.5 its a little smaller than oem badge, doesnt fit in oem grill.  broke support off the back so it was flat and glued it on new grill. looks good and got here quicker than expected. dont order if you want OEM badge for 2010-2015 its for earlier models.
B003YBMDRU|5|Excellent quality, even better than expected
B00B7WYLIC|1|Lasted only a few months not worth it
B001RBQF4G|4|Have not actually used it yet. It is very large. I have to wrap it around the back of my bike to keep it on. Looks fine, rubber comes off metal hooks fairly easily.
B00275JKCK|5|Better then I expected.  Looks great on my jeep.
B000JZY5ZW|5|Received on time as promised. I decided to install them the same day. No instructions, but Youtube fixed that. Because the old lifter were so warn out, I had to hold up the window with my head when I removed the first one. The removal and re-installation took less than a minute, so no headache. Once the first new one was installed, it held the window up so I didn't have to hold up the window to replace the second one. Once both lifters were installed, the window operated better than new. The window opened, lets call it briskly, with a smoothness I haven't seen in years. Closing the window was stiff, but they are new. A great replacement for the cost.
B00JGQM3CM|5|If your looking at this and wondering if it's right for you pull the trigger and purchase this
B00CAYFHRU|5|comfort for my bike & I
B002SN9CM4|5|Arrived in record time and was packed to survive armageddon! Thank you!
B000BO6P5E|1|Can't believe people have been complaining about the deceptive picture since 2013 and it is still the same! The pic is a LIE! This is not a variety pack. They are all 15 amp!!
B0035R0TEC|5|Used to us Napa fuel filter.  This is just as good at a good price.
B00CIJ5Q50|5|love this sticker ..cept for the tip of the seat that looks like he got a woody.. you can cut it out..like I did..
B000CLSQ0I|4|They are very quiet when braking. Not much force is needed, and the stopping distance is reduced. It feels very good under heavy / high speed braking. I will buy it again but there is one  thing that annoys me about it. It's the sensor cable. It's too short (Like this sentence). It is much shorter than the OEM brake pads, and that causes my disc brake light to stay on. But overall, it's a great product!
B00D99RJOO|1|Shipping was quick. I received 2 of the 3 items I purchased, and the 2 do not even fit my vehicle despite the description indicating so. Sent for return/refund.
B006FUT09G|5|very good product I use on all glass
B0043RUXE4|5|Excellent.
B003L60ERE|3|good product
B00EKUKJWA|5|As described, delivery not as quick as I had hoped.
B00J43KXJW|5|Very good.
B00WHS3OR4|3|Product took about two weeks to arrive. It's not bad quality for the money but some of the silk screen painting is starting to crack after just a few weeks.
B004QEQIN4|1|The auto down button did not work and you have to hit down a bunch of times to get the window to go down.
B000BWCDDY|5|I put these on my 1998 dodge Dakota and it took the &#34;bump&#34; out of my take off awesome.I highly recommend these traction bars
B007VR6S7O|5|Replaced the stock distributor in my Chevrolet pickup. This distributor has no high performance claim but I like the machine work of the housing itself and it works just fine. Great for the money.
B00HVNO2LM|3|It faded rather sooner than expected.
B00KPQYV0E|4|-- My experience with the selling dealer was great!<br />--  My experience with the manufacturer once I needed answers and help left a lot to be desired.
B004HEE0VA|5|Awesome roof rack! Love the look of it. Looks so nice on my Blue Lagoon Jetta MK4. Very happy with my purchase.
B00270RHUW|5|Great!
B001AMHPNM|4|seems good so far
B0074BPAS0|5|Love my lights!
B0060YHLHU|5|Worked as expected.
B0009TAOBC|5|works as advertised, nothing fancy
B007VRAH30|4|All as I expected.  Gauge is within 5 pounds of being correct.  Quality is okay for the price (welds, fittings, hose).  Should include a ball valve for purging.<br /><br />Glad I purchased.
B0009JKI72|5|Easy install and worked like a charm
B00TORH3S2|5|Seems like a great towel. Nice and plush. Definitely a cut above the cheap branded towels you can find at your local discount stores. No indication of where it was made.
B00K7XWNKA|5|For the price I think its exactly what you should get. The wording is a little larger than the original keep one. Fit my extra tire perfect and its doing exactly what it needs to do!
B004GE6M8U|3|Its fit and work but the motor is reversed due to this the switch is  vise versa
B000GV0YEU|4|Way too high.if you ride in heat stay 13&#34; or below.But these are too expensive.If you get one you are happy with.quality is great.just shop around.Try J&P Cycles,Cruiser custimizing or Dennis Kirk.
B00N8LUV4I|5|I like these lights better than the original factory like that they give you it lights up the road more and I can see better the only thing I don't like is when you turn on the high beams the regular lights don't turn back on half the time is there something wrong with my lights
B001PN78BK|4|It fit my CS-2N helmet with the longer screws that came with the shield. You get eye protection which is why I purchased them, them as in I ordered the clear, and dark ones. Although, my intent was to change shields over from daylight to night riding. Not going to happen, at least not out on the road or in rainy weather. They are NOT snap-ons. It takes a screw driver and some hand manipulation to remove/install. I would have given a 5 star rating if not for that significant detail.
B00QW3PZNQ|5|Arrived an worked as stated
B00OZ6SOGM|1|Did not work. Leaked more than before I installed this new plug.
B000182EXC|5|Easy to install. Does what it is supposed to do.
B003VLBPJA|3|Weak bungee cord.
B0085XV9JA|3|If pretty durable but would have liked some instructions on how to attatch the hook and the clip thing.
B005JZQU2S|5|Screws sucker but made them work.
B00CMXCJLQ|5|Excellent
B0010GDGFY|5|Excellent replacement part.  I toasted the mass airflow sensor in my 2010 Chevy Equinox 2.4L by spraying intake cleaner on it while the engine was running. The MPG's dropped from 29 down to 22 Hwy.  The original sensor was slightly dirty from using a popular oil coated washable air filter.  This is a common problem generated by those type filters.  Please do some research on the internet before you try cleaning any mass airflow sensor because they have very sensitive electronic parts which are damaged easily and be sure to use a cleaner specifically made for cleaning mass airflow sensors.<br />I can strongly recommend this product.  After replacing the sensor my first day back on the road showed 27.5 mpg which included stop and go traffic.  Problem solved!
B000F5JM0O|5|These things have come in handy more times than I can count. I don't touch an engine now without having these in my tool cart. I can't imaging not having them now.
B002OPPSGU|5|Good quality for a great price
B001O048EO|5|Fit my 99 chrysler 300 m perfectly
B00UYMRNOU|1|Didn't measure 5 &#34; across like expected and I don't think they are the pencil beam!
B004WE9I3K|5|best thing ever for removing doggie paw prints from my leather couches
B00029WYEY|5|This is the product you need to clean and restore your reusable filter.  Be advised that too much oil can, and will, lead to a dirty mass airflow sensor.  Check the internet for proper cleaning of your mass airflow sensor.  This kit is for cleaning and restoring the filter only.<br />Instructions for using this product are clear and easy to follow.
B00G1Y3ERA|5|Very sharp looking and easy installation
B00JAO5L9W|3|Its a nice helmet for the price, good looking and quality seems ok. But not ideal if you are going to use it in high speed. The medium size is slightly loose for me (i normaly use M and fits tight). The problem with this is that at high speed the air pushes the helmet against your face and your chin ends up crashing against the front of the helmet making it almost impossible to ride above 200km/h. Also, it is on the heavy side (probably because it has the dual visor and opening mechanism). I have another regular full face helmet (single visor, tight fit, lightweight) which i will keep using in my high speed motorcycle. I will probably keep this one for passengers only.
B00429NKWK|5|Worked great!  The instructions were easy to follow and the results were as promised.
B00WFHFG4G|5|Good quality
B00NN3RZ9K|5|It works get. Thank you
B00ERXG4TM|5|Used this on a 14 hour motorcycle trip.  It takes a little bit of trial and error to get the friction correct.  Although not true cruise control it gave my throttle hand a much needed break.
B00W58P1AY|5|Replaced the factory bulbs in my RV with these. Installation was simple. Caution: You do have to install the bulbs with the correct polarity on DC systems. If it doesn't work, rotate the bulb 180 degrees and re-install. The light is a little &#34;bluer&#34; than the factory incandescent bulbs, but the light output seems to be similar. Will check back on power usage.
B001P4DKI4|5|Purchased prior to my 2000 mile trek to Sturgis this year, and man am I glad I did!!  Enough said.
B00BJUEVLO|1|wouldnt fit my bike like it said
B000AME50Y|1|S*** product nothing more than car wax !!!
B00T3E8XBC|5|Easy to apply and it looks great!
B0009OR90Q|5|Works great, not much to say, it gaps a spark plug!
B002G3PHSE|5|These are the only wiper replacements available for my Audi A6. The adhesion to the windshield and clearing capacity are remarkable. They are more upfront but are a value with their performance and longevity.
B008YL91U2|5|Budget badassery.  It works and it's a lot cheaper than you'd pay in a typical shop.
B000O0O3CC|5|Exactly like the original
B00CYLWV6E|2|Not sweat/waterproof, so does not protect my seat from sweat at all
B007R4GUZ6|1|Cheaply made. Its like a vinal patch ironed onto a bandana. Won't form to your face
B002X9TNFE|5|Great product and a Fair price..
B0032YVDEI|5|got it for someone else love it
B00OKX9CLG|5|Plug it in and turn on the ignition (the order doesn't matter) and the thing goes to work.  The description of the error codes are easy to find on the interned so the accompanying DVD/CD went untested.  It has a handy feature for flushing the car's computer log.  Beats sitting around with the battery disconnected for five minutes or so.  It distinguished between upstream and downstream O2 sensors calling us to task when we only replaced one.  A bargain too!!!
B00DUV105K|5|It goes right in easily. It's probably an OEM filter for the car too. No drama, just one rubber seal and not two like the aftermarket brands.
B0045WBVUM|4|Sweet on the seat
B00029WR78|4|It's a good plug.
B00GWFKSOK|5|These mats fit and work as advertised. I have an in-floor 4x4 shifter and these mold right around it. I don't have carpet so they slide around on occasion but not to impede my driving. I am in and out of my truck quite often and my boots pick up mud and gunk as various as the jobsites. The mats are easy to remove clean and replace.  I recommend buying these.
B004RCUY5S|5|Fit perfectly
B00G2GRY4Q|1|Both broke in a matter of weeks. Very cheaply made.
B000U0Z2L2|5|I like these for the price and the quality but I am not using as often as I thought I would. I bought this to connect all of our devices when we were going on a long trip. This worked well for me.
B01037HBCY|5|Easy install and directions were user friendly, looks great only con is that you do not retain the key lock cover<br /><br />My first time doing any work on this bike, took around 30min to put everything together
B001FAZWRA|5|Liked them a lot but my SO didn't want to put them in our car because we have leather seats, but they look great, very vibrant color.
B004PL4H0O|5|they hold great
B003OY8OHK|5|They did the trick.
B009AA220W|5|Perfect!
B00I548U0K|5|These look great on my 2015 Honda pilot the guy who installed them said every thing was there and in place, no drill holes to make .These cost 149.00, I tried to order the 249.00 from another company they did not ship free  to Alaska, I feel like I got a great deal, These are sturdy And they look awesum !!!!
B000E3CYJ8|5|I am still a bit old school where I like the sheepskin covers. I am in a warmer climate but I still love the feel of the wheel cover as well as the seat covers.  As long as I am driving, I will keep this type of cover on my cars. I think there may be a misconception that they are hot but they keep the seats cool in the summer and warm in the cold months.
B0064QQIT6|5|Good value did not fix gas cap error code. But hey it looks nice on jeep.
B000C0YP3Q|5|Got it yesterday and was fast delivery and March's the original house perfectly!
B003TXH6XE|1|no screw come in the box.....i need to buy !!!!
B001F0IE7A|5|Got the 3x3 version.  Worked out very well.  You'll need a cut-off blade to cut the tongue.  Supplied center punch works well.  Make sure to follow directions and step the drilling.  Very happy with this product.
B00EECL90U|5|im saying they look better then the philips but lets see how long they last thats the real test... btw if its a bmw you have to take the wheels off and the plastic wheel well cover to get to the lights
B007JMTS14|5|Worked great to connect a removable inverter to a battery under my vehicle seat.
B00BJ5Y7YK|2|I got this kit at half price. The cool factor is awesome. But! If you don't pay attention or people that don't know that you have them will bang the crap out of your door around the lock. The kit will sag with temperature change. The shocks don't really work very well in the cold. I'll be building my own kit next time. Glad I didn't pay full price.
B008VLVDII|5|The material is heavy duty so it will protect your expensive leather if you need to carry boxes or other items that may cause wear and tear. If you have a new sedan like me, the extra straps are useless. Modern cars have the rear bench molded into the interior. I use the head rest straps to hold up the seat cover and that is about it. But I don't intent to carry people. I would expect for SUVs and perhaps older vehicles the straps would work better. The size is perfect for a mid-size to smaller vehicle. It barely covers my rear seat and my car is mid-sized. The scent is interesting. The cover has a heavy petroleum solvent pistachio scent. I like it as it gives you a new car type smell. But mothers with young children or some pet owners may want to air the cover out for a few weeks. I can carry my rifle cases on the rear seat and not worry about scuffs and tears. Plus if I want to impress the cover comes out in seconds. For the money it does what I want. If I want tailored seat covers, they don't make them for my car.
B001AI9L0G|5|This kit did a awesome job I my Vulcan 800. When I acquired it, the chain hadn't been cleaned in over 6 months and looked hopelessly rusty. After approx. 30 minutes the chain looks practically new. I Don't think I used quite 2 ounces. Still have almost a full bottle left.
B00VIVH1LG|4|Came as a complete kit, everything fit as labeled, and after installation performed as expected. Would buy again if needed.
B00F09ACMM|1|THE CHROME CAME OFF IN FRONT OF MY CHURCH I WAS SO EMBARRASSED THAT I JUST LEFT IT ON THE GROUND<br />AND DROVE HOME
B007TYN6A6|5|nice fit
B0059XCVVO|4|works well. decent price.
B005TTZ78M|5|My 97 tj 's sway bar end links broke off when the previous owner had it, so it had no sway bar at all when i bought it. These things are great. Easy to install. Easy to connect/disconnect. I give them 5 stars. A+++
B000CO81KA|4|Install was pretty easy on a 2002 F150 Supercrew, though it doesn't sit exactly right and will sometimes rattle.  Could be something with my truck or something with the unit, I'm not sure.  Overall, I have definitely noticed more power when accelerating, especially with a load.  I can easily get up to speed to merge on the highway without worrying about being too slow.  As for an increase in miles per gallon, I have noticed a small increase, but only under certain circumstances.  Stop and go traffic, there is no difference, as I spend too much time idling.  When I am maintaining speed, I can usually get 0.5 to 1.5 more miles per gallon, which on a truck that was getting in the 15-16 range and is now getting in the 16-18 range, is very nice.  I plan on installing a throttle body spacer and making a few more minor modifications in the future and I think that is when this kit will shine.
B007VRDDTK|3|worked wonders
B001BW8BCU|5|Works great!  Looks great!  Easy to install - 5 minutes!
B00CHCZU4K|5|Great  and dilivery  was fast
B000VAZHFC|5|It's going on two years now without a problem
B000H84UVK|5|My VW Vanagon had weak horn syndrome... New fuse improve the flow of current... but the stock VW horn is small and not very loud even when working properly.  This one is pretty close to the VW beep beep sound much with much more authority.  I am not a big honking person but when you need to send out the alert you want something that can be heard.  A big safety improvement for my van.
B003V63FCU|5|This rocker set worked perfectly on my 350 small block chevy. The prior set constantly had chatter noises these were fine after tightening them done after so many miles. The price was right too. The auto store by my wanted a hundred more for the same ones.
B006STTIVY|5|perfect and great price.
B00YAW45IC|5|This pump is great. Now my wife can fill the generator if I'm away without spilling a drop. It also fit both of my cans.
B000B5QFE4|5|Used for about 700 miles of towing so far, no problems!  Mirrors are mounted solidly, no rattling or shaking.  They look great and are highly functional.  It's also nice having a set of slip on mirrors I don't need to re-adjust every time I put them on!
B00PV37ZEA|5|Love it so much it's very convenient to use and it's waterproof. GREAT ITEM !! Usually we have a lot garbage, food package and drink bottles in the car but we don't know where to put, usually we will put things in the car mat, but that makes it very easy to get dirt. When you have a lot friends in your car that sounds not funny at all.  After we got this bag, we no need to worry about where to put our garbage. It's really convenient. For a safety consider, just don't put any expensive stuff in it in case it is stolen when you leave things in your car.
B0006JLU22|3|This product arrived in an opened box.  When I tried to assemble this product one of the hinge rods broke immediately.  I am going to use it anyway, but I can't recommend a product that breaks so readily when assembling according to directions.  I am skeptical that this product will be able to handle driving as it is milk jug type plastic and is both brittle and flexible at the same time.  I think it is going to blow apart going down the road, but I hope not.  The directions are not good either, btw, but they give you the general idea.
B009II5LVI|5|Good quality batteries and fast shipping
B0009IR0FG|5|Works just fine.  No problems.

B005C1Y9D6|2|Bulbs are bright but my issue is that the ones in the drivers side door stay on all the time and with doors close and while driving I swapped out with another one from the pack but they all stay on no matter what
B0062BHOOG|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B00MY4P0RI|4|Perfect fit, good price
B00CN855QQ|4|made a huge difference. no more play in the shifter. must have for any hurst shifter on a 6060
B001TI5IIQ|3|Cleans a bit, but not the best, and not really shiny neither. A month later it's all yellow again. Better bring your car to mechanic and let him clean it professionally.

B002N5DE2G|1|5 fuses for the same price as 120 fuses in other listings. Ridiculous.
B00AQAFDNS|4|Perfect fit, too bad Smith is discontinuing the IOX get them while you can they are awesome ski goggles and my son and I teach and ski over 60 days a year
B00RJUZY9Q|2|The clip does not fit snug on my Chevy S10 sun visor. Whenever I try to take my sunglasses off the clip, it frequently swivels and tries to come off the visor. Unsafe while driving, so o have to use both hands before I drive.
B00J7YZ640|4|Very good
B004Y9ADDC|5|Works great!
B00EBU3YDA|5|perfect fit, works great.
B00K0AQVE4|5|Loved it.
B008N69C7U|5|I bought a brand new bike and rather then letting the monkeys in my service center touch my &#34;beloved&#34; Yamaha R3 I will clean and lube my chain myself. I already know MOTUL makes great products, I use their brake fluid in my vehicles so why not buy this along with their chain cleaner.<br />This chain lube sticks well and I get minimal splatter after lubing up. No funny smells and makes the chain run smooth and quieter.
B000C2E6A6|5|Matches the OEM gasket perfectly.
B00Z7KIZPA|5|great
B007GLCO3W|5|good product
B00SQHBL1G|2|This is a STICKER not a decal.  When I saw the description i wasn't expecting a paper sticker.  Maybe my idea of a decal and sticker are wrong but this is not at all what i expected, but for the price i paid, it hardly worth returning.
B000CNAVKE|5|As described.
B003O0Z2O2|5|worked perfectly and didn't have to buy from the Dealer!
B00004RA7R|5|Works Great.
B0007VQ3CG|1|Do not buy!!!! Purchased for my 03 expedition and they went on perfect, looked great but there is no room to put your foot on it
B00A66GYDA|1|Used this 3 times and worked fine. The fourth time it was used it did not work. Out of warranty by 16 days.  :-(<br />You get what you pay for.

B00QXWL850|1|Shows 6 components but kit ships with only Belt and 1 pulley and a couple seals...
B0038QV2S2|5|Fantastic price for a Breather set that look Great. I love the Red flame print on the Breathers. They come with grommets which really were needed. My previous Breather had a smaller neck but a much thicker grommet. This Breather did fit my valve cover on my 79 corvette even with a much larger neck but the included grommet did fit. Two grommets are included with two chrome Red flame Breathers. Great product and price.
B000CODGXW|5|Good product, good prce
B0070Y36NC|5|very good and fast service would order again
B008Y8J1GY|5|Brand New Part just as Described, Super Low Price !!!
B000S2U6QI|3|Just like the original..except that my antenna mast won't fit the new base.  Had to weld up and adapter.<br />Typical GM changing part specs in the middle of the assembly process.
B005LHN248|5|Love this tire cover! Fits my jeep well
B009FREAGO|5|More heavy duty than I expected
B006WQSD1O|5|Good part
B00NEL6ONO|5|Why continue to purchase throw away cabin air filters.  This reusable filter eliminates that ongoing expense.  It seems to work as well as a disposable filter and can be cleaned a frequently as you desire.  If you plan to keep you Tacoma for a long time, this filter is a good investment.
B006Z907TY|4|Being a 'person of girth', (frankly..fat) there is much anxiety boarding a plane that has nothing to do with fear of flying.  Having my own extender puts my mind and middle at ease.
B00IZCNK20|1|I did not receive the correct parts. The part number on the plastic bag was the correct part number according to the site. The part I received was a one quarter inch male pipe thread. The description read one quarter inch male inverted flare, which is what I needed. I am NOT very happy.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|I am really enjoying this product.  It makes my leather sofa look and feel amazing.  It is easy to apply. And the application lasts a good month.
B005H7DRQA|5|I purchased the care kit to remove some sunscreen from my black leather seats and boy did this stuff do the trick.  Great product.
B00BAZBYTU|1|antenna  did not work
B00M8BEWBM|1|Didnt get work to dry lile sand paper
B000E322DQ|5|Got it quick!  And it was just as described.
B00M468ZSC|5|I was seeking a replacement for an 8+ year old duffle style overnight bag to carry my diabetic supplies in. I did a lot of searching; checking measurements and reading reviews before deciding on this bag.  I am very glad I did and am extreemely happy with my choice!!! This bag is quality nade and though it appears small ihas more than adiquate room for my needs. The end compartments are large enough to hold blood sugar meters (one on each end), the front zippered compartment is great for carrying extra pump batteries. And; although there are no inside compartments for smaller items I ordered some draw string mesh cell phone  bags to group the smaller items together and cause less fumbling. The main compartment is large enough for a cool pack(for insulin), an extra syringe (with case) as well as extra pump & diabetic supplies as well as needed medications so; with just a  little planing I can just 'Grab & Go' to visit family orfor get togethers.
B00CRT8VPS|5|I wanted some safety glasses with a bit of flair and I love purple. I got these and I'm pleased. I don't have an issue with the nose area like others have said, but I have a smaller face. So for me it was a plus these were on the small side. They fit me perfectly.
B00SS3TWGY|5|Love it already stuck it on my easel after my trip.
B00EFFZ8TY|3|Works well, but likes to try to tip over.
B008CFVV0I|5|Quick. Easy to install/ replace. Ready to go with dielectric grease already in sockets! Thanks!
B000C1HTJC|5|Had 2 others that return spring failed within a month and this Airtex seems to be working great. Most people won't need one as this is for older classic cars.
B00AE27O08|1|Junk. Metal clip snapped under the slightest amount of pressure during install. Do not buy.
B00VNBDVOC|5|I have used HID in the past, other companies and OPT7.  OPT7 is the best by far that I have used.  These lights are easy to install, work better in my opinion since there is no warm up time, and fewer dark spots.  These lights are awesome and are just what I wanted.  I will say though that only after 4 days installed, one ballast, or driver with LED, went bad and stopped one headlight from working.  I contacted OPT7 through Amazon and although no reply over the weekend, Monday they responded and, as with past experiences, they replaced the driver with great support.  Try these LED lights out and I think you will not regret it.
B001DCF0XQ|3|Take note...this is only the cap. If you need the retaining strap and well as a new cap this isn't what you need.
B00P1N8QU2|5|These are a good product at a good price.  They came quickly like they said they would
B000C5UFG2|5|Nice OE quality sensor.
B00B3WB9NQ|5|Exactly what I needed and on time.

B00HCWZXZ6|1|Was unable to get the system to work would not lock on to satellite. contacted manufacturer and Dish Network they were unable to help me received the service. returned it to Amazon
B008KWLBKI|4|fits great on a 2006 prius. highly recomended.
B005NLQAHS|5|After following the instructions, it works fine with my Nissan Maxima and Android tablet.  The transmission temperature is not working, I'm not sure if this isn't available on the Maxima, but I hope it will just need some configuring to get it working.  This OBDII reading is very good at a very low price.
B003D3PP6K|5|fits well in the explorer . grocery bags work good for liners ..
B001AGP8TG|1|Doesn't fit my 2007 MDX, flange bolt holes don't line up with the CAT.

B007KCY8P4|5|Purchased for 2003 Honda Pilot. Exactly as listed, packaged very well, and fit perfectly! Thanks!
B007CISU6Y|4|My son and I installed the 2.5&#34; Teraflex Budget Boost with Shocks. Everything went well and it was an easy install, took us about 4 hours. We used the video posted on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixC0OzIF5Go).  Ever since the install I hear metal clanks and pops, even when I drive on a smooth surface. I have checked all the bolts and discovered that one of the nuts on a passenger side sway bar was missing. It happened because the sway bars was defective; the sway bar log kept spinning while I was putting a nut. Right now I put a nut back while trying to hold the log with a pair of pliers. I know this is not the ideal and that all the nuts need to be tightened with the torque wrench, but I am waiting for a new sway bar from Teraflex. Overall, there seems to be a lot of confusion on JK forums. see here http://www.jkowners.com/forum/showthread.php?t=41429. Some even suggest that the sway bars that came with the products should go back and the back ones should come to front...  Long story short, I DO NOT recommend this product.

B00HAOX10A|5|Fast, part was correct, and part fit my car and is doing great good buy at a great price
B00230QR3E|5|Easy to install and a perfect replacement for the air filter on my GS750
B00FYLGNFQ|5|Good quality
B011AOBCPG|4|Fits nicely on my 2015 T4 and is easy to install.  It doesn't quite fit like the picture in the ad.  Granted, the T4 is a larger machine.  It reaches half way down the front wheels but doesn't reach down to the rear wheels.  I don't mind though, the elastic edging snugs up tightly under the rear storage bed.  Has an underside and a backside strap to keep it tight on your machine.  The two access openings are very convenient for reaching into the machine without removing the cover.  Would have given five stars if it weren't for the cheap zippers.  While zipping one side closed, the zipper pull-tab broke off in my hand the first day.  Having said that, it is a nice cover for the price.  Product was received the day after ordering it, what a nice surprise!.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Great, everything fit perfectly and was easy to install.
B00AYAICW4|5|Great
B000C9Q2LA|5|Works great.
B000PH73SU|5|came well packaged. They fit my hoses and were easy to put on.  worked great and solved the problem I was having.
B001AIZ5HY|1|no it didn't work

B007W6X2M8|4|Instruction it would've been very helpful.
B004N96EKO|5|Absolutely Awesome
B001TNKZB6|5|Awesome Product. Keeps Van from bottoming out. Recommend them on any vehicle. Is as was describe. As we all know many products are not!!
B007USSKE8|2|Unbelievable but the color from Touch up direct and other brands is much more accurate. Also the pen part (you can remove it to get a brush on the other end) never gets enough paint (maybe due to thickness) so forget about fine lines.
B00P0BFPK4|4|As described and works great.
B00KTHXN1M|1|Piece of junk.  Stopped working after 2 weeks.  It's past the return time so I can't send it back.  Waste of money.
B000CFIC4E|4|I replaced the original spark plugs in my van with these (which are the OEM part) and the fuel economy and power are right back to where they were 60,000 miles ago.  The gap had to be adjusted to spec on most of the plugs I purchased.  It's not a major issue, but you'd expect them all to be consistent.  No two of them had the same gap out of the box.
B003UT3S6Q|5|Great
B0018IDTU6|4|good
B001AEX48K|4|At this price point though, we didn't expect perfection.  We have been very impressed with the top so far. Amazed since it was so inexpensive.<br />Installation was not bad - would have been much smoother had my husband read the directions before attaching it upside down to the header panel. Luckily, that was an easy fix!  There is a slight fitment issue on the drivers side. It seems just a bit too far, maybe 3/4-1&#34;, forward where top hooks onto door surrounds. However, it doesn't seem to interfere with overall fit - top does fit tightly. It is surprising quality for the price.<br />It is amazingly quiet. We get more noise from the seatbelts rattling in wind with windows out than from the top. When windows in, still quieter than expected - can hear stereo & hold a conversation with no problem. There is some noise, but if you have a Jeep, then you should be used to it.<br />The fabric seems heavy enough to last for awhile. Its not as heavy as OEM, but it is a good, hefty weight.  The color is good. We got black denim. It is a black with a slight grey cast - almost perfect match to our slightly faded fenders.<br />The windows are a nice dark tint.  Very nice on super sunny days! The zippers seem sturdy & strong. The teeth are substantial.<br />Have had no issues with the top (other than slight fitment issue). Definitely no leaks. After all the rain we have had, if there was a leak, the TJ would be full of water.<br />We had needed a replacement top and we needed it fast - got 1 day shipping. Had it on just in time for a club trail ride. Have had this on our 2001 TJ for about a month now. We have had no issues zipping windows in and out or putting top up or down. Still amazed we got it at such a low price point.  It has really surprised us with its quality and performance.
B000Q0U7ES|5|Great product.
B000S8G02Q|5|All good, thank you
B00KTIYZ5O|1|Doesn't work with m my vehicle

B005XV26RG|5|great price
B00CEX4L9W|4|In order to hide the cord, an extension is required. I thought it is long enough to do without another purchase
B00N9XVPAE|5|These are great!
B00ZOKJVAG|1|Horrible do not protect anything , is made from a cheap cheap material. Returned!
B00X9V7W4E|4|Good buy
B004HEE0VA|5|Works perfectly on my MKIV 2000 Jetta. Attached a Rhino Rack to the top with a bag and hauled from CA to OH with zero problems. Stayed secured the entire time, and did not come loose. Very easy to install and remove following the instructions provided.
B0056ELT8C|5|great fit
B000BAT5Z0|5|Love it.  Works great!  Mounted it on the front of our washtub/sink in the garage.
B002FKHN9O|5|Great product fit perfectly on my Harley.
B003HOWSYC|1|This is not what it looks like dont even bother buying this is a waste of time and money
B0055ALUL8|5|Good quality, fits and works perfect.
B008I7OU0S|5|It was a perfect fit and it got here fast which was awesome
B00JA1C4MM|5|Bought it to get rid of the tight equal length stock headers on my 2005 2.5RS. Came 4 days sooner than it said it would! Hardest part was getting the bolts off of the catalytic converter, as exhaust parts usually bind together from heat and moisture off the ground. It didnt line up, but that is normal. Just took the O2 sensors off of their TERMINALS, I didn't unscrew them from the cat. Took out the mounting bolt behind the cat, dropped it down about a foot and could easily bolt headers on to the cat. After it is attached to cat I loosely bolted one side of the manifold then pulled the other side on, tightened her down, drove a day or two then got under and checked the tightness again. No leaks, nice looking welds. Be sure to shine a flashlight down the tubes when you take it out of the box to see if there are any holes ANYWHERE. The smallest leak in your exhaust will cause a loss of back-pressure, which is crucial for engines. I am very happy with the rumble I get at idle and low rpms, with no other exhaust mods
B0012PZ5SE|5|A little difficult to get on, but that is my inexperience. RV handles much better now.
B00D7LXY6Q|1|Plastic
B005GECGQQ|5|Exactly as advertised, good value.
B002P8L7M0|4|Good mirror
B00C43BOE2|5|Good oil at a great price and free shipping with Amazon Prime.
B00829I2ME|5|Installed on my 2008 Lexus IS250.<br />This came with the gasket and rubber washers. I spent $150 total that day including all parts and lunch for me and a friend. Compared to $800 Lexus wanted and $711 plus liquid and tax Firestone wanted. Actually simple install, just take your time. Side note I used a gallon concentrated antifreeze with a gallon of distilled water. Saved even more money there. Could not be happier.
B003YMTJ9O|5|Great deal
B005HMOSSG|5|Very nice product.
B00THHE8JG|1|Flew off somewhere the next day
B00VSDZAVM|5|Great quality and looks awsome on the back of my truck!
B00PSEWTDO|3|OK...<br />This is my third armored jacket.<br />As far as motorcycle jackets go its &#34;ok&#34;<br />the &#34;cool&#34; factor is there, but the jacket itself is a bit bulky on the arms, but nothing major.<br /><br />The major flaw on the jacket is its length. The jacket doesn't provide enough coverage, mainly on the backside. which at the end of the day leaves you showing your crack to the world.<br /><br />nonetheless... the jacket is unique and POPs even though is all black.
B000AY3H6K|4|Nice looking; high quality.  A bit pricey, but otherwise great.
B000GTIR5K|5|Item arrived on time and performed as advertised.
B00MY3V2WQ|4|Great quality! Met my expectation!
B0068C281I|3|Minor fitment issues easily fixed under 5 minutes with dremel tool (overall trimming for aftermarket parts on bike along and trimming the fairing due to injection mold runoff ect), I bought this setup for around $220 shipped so the price was right. If you cant find it for what I paid I recommend auctmart or profairing for under 400 shipped they also come with free gifts like complete bolt kit and tank pad ect.
