B000YXMMAO|5|This is one of my favorite albums. It is nice to be able to add it to my vinyl collection...
B000WN4MVS|5|this is a classic, this is a classic, this is a classic! if you've never seen this movie please look at before you see the remake!!!!!!
B00881VLCE|3|I love this app but I am so bummed that the newest version has a watermark background preview. I would much rather look at an actual picture for the preview. It's too hard to see. Give me back my preview and ill change it back to a 5 star. Disappointed.
B004RSCWZ2|5|I bought this CD, for my hubby, for his birthday.  It arrived in the mail yesterday, and man, he loves it!  This band is awesome, they totally rock!  Both my hubby, and I, are looking forward to more stuff from this talented group.  Oh, yeah, and the actual CD product, was superb - Thank you amazon.com.<br /><br />In addition to,  my hubby, really likes the song lyrics which are printed out on a nice little insert,  and are included in the deal.<br /><br />If you love blues music, then you will love this band.  If you like Bonnie R, you will love this gal too - She can SANG!!!<br /><br />Peace, Out - Z
B000FA5STS|4|This story kept me on the edge of my seat. Lots of twist and turns and keep me interested. It was hard to put down.
B00KA7JIII|5|Love it
B00OALBUZY|4|ok
B00SXK316E|4|It was ok.  I heard friends going on about it so much I expected a little more.<br /> I ordered it while stuck inside for 5 days during an ice storm.  Doubt I'll buy season 2.
B000053VAZ|5|No leading man in his right mind would have taken on the challenge of this film.  Not only was the physical comedy extremely difficult, the theme of a peculiar man falling in love with a mentally ill woman was off the charts.  Yet, this is a tender love story, full of smiles, good feelings, fear, anger and ultimately grim satisfaction.  Depp proves his dedication to art rather than box office and he shines in this film with an astonishing array of physical comedy, deep, sensitive characterization and a sense of wonder and amazement no actor has ever been able to achieve.  \\"Innocent,\\" \\"slightly off,\\" \\"low IQ,\\" \\"a stranger in a strange place,\\" Depp captures the awe and mystery of loving life and discovering tender emotion for another.  Certainly his greatest role in an unknown film, following \\"Ed Wood,\\" the ultimate, most brilliant achievement of his career.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|great game you should get this and it is very fun. my kids can play it very well. we have contest to see how well each of us can do.  thanks for having this game for free.
B00MWD7XR6|4|Loved all three books
B004QSQML8|4|If you love fairy tales, films like The Hobbit, fantasy, magic and Tom Cruise, this film must be in your collection. It includes two versions of the film. Spanish subtitles.
0345803485|1|Without doubt, the worst written and most immature \\"novel\\" I have ever come across. Curiosity is fueling lots of readers. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't buy it... but was persuaded to borrow and read! Puerile, laughable...the same phrases repeated throughout with gob-smacking frequency. Non-erotic sex scenes with no sense of the magic and mystery of sexual passion. References to idiotic \\"sub-conscious\\" and \\"inner-goddess\\" personae (!), the protagonist \\"flushing\\" and biting her (erotic) lip constantly, and she can't even call genitals by name, instead there are the incessant references to \\"down there!\\" How old is E.L. James, for God's sake?<br />Like other reviewers, I also thought this must surely have been written by an adolescent, and one without a good command of English! I agree with the person who said that the first few chapters made her want to gouge her own eyes out! Yes indeed! This is gouge-worthy reading at its worst. One star is really a generous rating for such poor quality prose, laughably lame story line and characters so hollow, who cares about them anyway?!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Keeps you busy!
B000068TP0|3|Ten out 11 songs are in Spanish. The only English song exists is called \\"Inevitable\\".    I returned it for a refund. Why is this information not listed on Amazon?    I can't rate this DVD fairly because there's no category for \\"N/A\\". So, I gave it 3 stars.
B00979CS50|2|I used to say that one day, Bruce Springsteen would release an album of nothing but the sounds of passing gas, and that it would sell in the millions. Such is the cult of the naked emperor - if you really love someone's art, you'll buy the crappy stuff and pretend it's golden to avoid the wrath of other cultists who are deeper into the muck than you are. Well, I'll be damned if Neil Young didn't beat Da Bruce to it. Granted, this album isn't all wind, but there's so much gas in it that you're too numb to appreciate most of the good parts if you have any discerning taste at all.    The opening \\"Driftin' Back\\", a 27-minute-plus free-association opus that could mostly have been written by your 8-year-old sister, is three chords and a dream, without the dream. Young and the Horse sit you down and swing a watch in front of your eyes with the opening acoustic hippie chant \\"hey now now / hey now now\\" (these lyrics might actually be from a Journey outtake - they're only missing the \\"whooooaaaahhhh\\"), then fade it into the rarest of monsters, a boring one that stays too long and eats nothing. I kept thinking about the old SNL skit, \\"The Thing That Wouldn't Leave\\" - Neil blathering about Picasso and bad mp3 sound, the band hitting and missing chord-change cues while listeners strapped to their chairs with eyes propped open \\"Clockwork Orange\\"-style scream for mercy, at least until they realize they can just turn the damn thing off. This track is easily the biggest wind Young has ever released, and he's blown a lot of gas out over the years, especially the last decade or two. Two tracks later, in the other song that also easily wears out its welcome, \\"Ramada Inn\\", Neil whines \\"seems like lately / things are goin' south\\", and your inner voice says, \\"Gee, ya think?\\"    Elsewhere in the album Neil rolls out a few nice ones. \\"Born In Ontario\\" pulls off a goofy-cute \\"Time Fades Away\\" vibe that makes you forget that he's basically letting you know he's Canadian for the 232nd time. This is immediately followed by \\"Twisted Road\\", which has much better lyrics about driving and rock and roll but musically sounds just like the last song. \\"She's Always Dancing\\" starts like \\"Driftin' Back\\" did, non-electric (in this case, a cappella) as the song itself fades in (which probably means the original opening was so bad they had to cut it out - a rare moment of editing), but it's one-third as long and three times as interesting - the harmonies keep it from sounding like every third song Neil and the Horse has ever released.    As the disc heads toward wrapping up, its best song by far is a ballad. (On a Crazy Horse album. Go figure.) \\"For The Love Of Man\\" has a cinematic, gospel elegance that overrides the occasional bad cliche in the lyrics. It's a trap, though, lulling you into submission for the 16-minute \\"Walk Like A Giant\\", which starts off like Neil Young And The Seven Dwarfs whistling over a classic (i.e. same old) Crazy Horse loop and ends with the gang working the last chord for minutes in a desperate attempt to get Neil worn out so he'll finally stop playing. Finally, an alternate mix of \\"Psychedelic Pill\\" with less-phased vocals clears the palate and snaps its fingers to wake you from your hypnotic state refreshed, forgetting that you heard any bad notes. At this point you are programmed and will fawn over this bloated mess as if it were a great EP. Which it could be, if Young trimmed an album-and-a-half from it.    In his book a few years ago Young bemoaned that he was in a writer's block and didn't know if he could write music again. Despite occasional steps in the right direction, this album verifies every fear he had, and gives us new ones. Like, \\"Oh, God, what's next if this is the norm?\\"    Spoiler alert - it's a country covers album recorded live in an old-time recording booth, complete with Neil chatting up his dead mom. You have been warned.
B00F3W9NQ2|5|Gotta love those vampires! Especially Damon. He is so hot! I am happy that he & Elena are finally together. I just hope it lasts.
6305428042|5|I love this movie.  Have wanted it for a while and just never got around to picking it up but watched the movie every year on TV.  So much better to watch as a movie.  It funny and they all play their parts so well.<br />Great Movie!
B00F880BWG|1|I love the show but its not the full episode just clips and pieces..
B00A11AN6O|1|On Feb 16, 2015 i discovered a &#34;date taken&#34; problem and reported it to amazon.  Any JPG that has a &#34;date taken&#34; of 1970 or earlier displays on Iphones as &#34;no date&#34; - however the date displays on a windows computer correctly. Anyone taking the time to edit &#34;date taken&#34; via windows & store older photos will not be a happy camper if attempting to retrieve them on their Iphone. Those photos will all be lumped under &#34;no date&#34;. Hope Amazon will soon address this serious problem.
B004H4XDBI|5|Excellent book!
B00000J7SO|5|I didn't buy this record for many years because of poor editorial reviews.  However, some good reviews on Amazon changed my mind.  <br />This album is AWESOME.  I think the only post-1967 Dylan record better is Blood on the Tracks.  <br />Dylan's words and singing are mysterious, smooth, and ingenious as only Dylan can be.  The band is terrific, the sound simply transports you back to the glory days of 70's classic rock.
B00127RAJY|5|This is the best product I've ever bought! Jillian is amazing and she WILL give you amazing results all you have to do is give her 20 minutes of your day, only TWENTY MINUTES! Who doesn't have that kind of time? If you can come up with a \\"good excuse\\" then you are not serious about losing weight, gaining health, muscle, and a better you!<br /><br />There are three levels, I'm on my 16th day (level II) and I am definintely seeing great results. I won't lie to you, you probably will get sore the first few days, but don't give up! It's worth it and it goes away! Now, of course if you follow her program but keep up your nutrition with sodas, chips, and burgers, then no, I almost garuntee you nothing will happen. BUT keep up with her program, follow a good diet (no need for extremes here just be sure you're eating healthy while keeping an eye on portions)  and you won't be sorry :)

B000002H4C|4|I am still enjoying this selection. I saw this movie, thus heard the soundtrack back in 1985, but saw it again in January 2013. My only regret is that i spent that many years with out it in my collection.

B000WCBPOG|5|truth be told, I think this is even better than the original. While I appreciate their song writing talents, I've never really gotten into the Beatles vocally. But I love the vocals on here. And just for the record, I'm 51 so I'm not speaking as one who didn't grow up with them.
B00K0OI42W|5|Classic, still a great read
B005S9EK1S|1|I got this for my sister in law and due to the fact it was a chick flick is why I gave it a 1.  Sorry nothing personal.
B00IZUY0AS|5|Wow. This album is a privilege to listen to. Such a diverse compilation of sounds with the unifying thread of Natalie's rich and haunting voice. Serious topics tackled with depth but I didn't feel lectured to or dragged down....I felt simultaneously hopeful and hopeless listening to her lyrics. Her voice and lyrics are nothing if not moving, though with a beautiful subtlety that does not resort to the overly dramatic. Music is at it's best to me when I sense a communion with the singer's and my emotions/soul because of the melody/lyrics, and she certainly did that for me on this album. I think her long-time fans will love it and hope some newer fans craving more meaningful music try it out.
1576754227|5|Heard the CD version of EAT THAT FROG!, written and read<br />by Brian Tracy . . . he's a well-respected author on such subjects<br />as personal and business success . . . and since I've benefited<br />from his teachings in the past, I looked forward to this program--in<br />large part because of its catchy title . . . I also liked the premise of<br />the subtitle; i.e., that I'd learn 21 GREAT WAYS TO STOP<br />PROCRASTINATING AND GET MORE DONE IN LESS TIME.<br /><br />So you're probably wondering like I was: What's the deal behind<br />eating a frog?

B000056IKS|5|For those of you who are not familiar with Neu!, they're a duo from Dusseldorf, Germany. Neu! is made up of two outstanding guitarists Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother. The two created three cosmically wonderful ground breaking lp's between 1971-75. This is their self-titled debut originally put out in 1971. 'Neu!' starts off with &#34;Hallogallo&#34;, that's ten solid minutes of pure brain floating magic. Some weird sound effects and monitored feedback are combined in &#34;Sonderangebot&#34;. Then there's &#34;Weissensee&#34; that is TRUE progressive krautrock. &#34;Im Gluck&#34; is seven minutes of more superb feedback with sound effects of water and seagulls nearby, unreal!&#34; Negativland&#34; tends to show case Neu's industrial side. Needless to say, a brilliant lp and that was produced by the legendary record producer Conny Plank. Totally ignore the rather primitive cover art. As it turns out, Neu! has been an influence on several of today's artists such as Stereolab, Sonic Youth, late '70's David Bowie, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Johnny Rotten. Highly Recommended.
B00000JCB2|5|OK alot of people say Limp is just a bunch of [stuff], but then u look at the figures and u gotta realize alot of people saying this have to b hypocrites cos whenver a Limp album comes out there is ALOT of sells going on. Anyway about the CD itself its a essential rap-rock Cd of the finest quality. ...Anyways I highly reccomend this record!
B000SEFNMS|4|An interesting story. The outcome perhaps the folly of the overconfidence of indestructabilty of youth, perhaps the need to push one's self to the brink of death to feel in control in the rest of one's life or the OCD that is often exhibited by intelligent high achievers. The story is weaved with examples of others who have walked similar paths and the author's own experiences. You are left to decide why.
B00PB5AO4G|4|Lots of fun

B009KWU6Q2|3|My son wanted me to watch this movie after seeing the live TV presentation of Peter Pan.  He had seen the movie before and loved it - he would give it 5 stars!  But I was not as crazy about it and got a little bored (but not as bored as I got with the TV show).
B000N4SHPS|4|When Rocky Balboa, the sixth installment in the series, was announced, there was almost a unanimous cry of \\"ugh\\" from people. Like the Terminator getting a horrible third outing or Alien which had a really lackluster fourth one, the idea that another Rocky was coming out was almost like saying another franchise was getting another unceremonious finale. Imagine people's surprise when it actually didn't suck and it was - gasp - pretty good. It's not an awesome movie though but when you think about what it is and what it could've been, it's quite an achievement. <br /> <br />Rocky Balboa is having a hard time dealing with the highs of his youth and constant reminders of his current lows. Make matters worse, he has a rather shaky relationship with his son Robert and his wife Adrian has passed away. He's incredibly nostalgic for the old days and he has to realize the old days are over and he's seen as part of it. In the boxing world, current heavyweight champion Mason Dixon is underappreciated and booed since he keeps beating anyone he comes across and there's no heart in his fights. When a \\"what if\\" computer simulated fight appears on TV, it gets people curious and Rocky and Dixon seem up for it. <br /> <br />But Rocky's old age and a \\"has-been\\" aura brought on by critics tries to deter him and while billed as an exhibition match for charity, it becomes an even bigger match for Rocky and for Dixon who wants to be appreciated by actually proving he's a good fighter since so many of his fights were rather easy. With the help of his son, Adrian's brother Paulie and Marie, now all grown up, Rocky steps into the ring and proves he can still pull off the impossible. <br /> <br />If there's anything that's bad about the film is that there's a little bit too self-conscious tone to the film where it knows it's an underdog story and meant to be inspirational but it kinds of pushes it. Nearly every line of dialogue Rocky says is some beat-all-obstacles tagline that they'd put on movie posters (the one they probably didn't use for the movie ends up being the cover tagline I bet). And the whole thing just feels like a big downer after all since there's so much hardship Rocky has to deal with, you're almost surprised there wasn't a scene of him jumping off a bridge. Obviously this is meant to reinforce the more inspirational aspect of the film but it feels like the film's a walking Chinese cookie dispenser. <br /> <br />Sylvestor Stallone I always saw as being lumped into that \\"action hero\\" stigma of guys who look tough and can say one liners but they can't act. In this, he's actually pretty good (though not Oscar-worthy) and if it wasn't for the aforementioned lines he says, it'd be a quite poignant performance. Milo Ventimiglia does an admirable job as his son Robert and Geraldine Hughes is also quite good as Marie who isn't really portrayed as a kind of \\"Adrian Part 2\\" but instead just a female friend Rocky can count on for support.  <br /> <br />The film as a whole is kind of erratic for the most part. The pacing during its initial two-thirds is sketchy with many scenes of Rocky reminiscing and trying not to let things get to him (such as a humorous scene where a young punk girl goes after him cause he didn't buy them beer). It takes a good hour before the fight is actually officially announced and then we go into the training montage, complete with the infamous music and the museum step run although amusingly, it has a dog in it. But the big star is the fight which is a big knockdown drag-out fight between Rocky and Dixon and, shot in HBO-like format rather than the \\"in the ring\\" approach Raging Bull had, it's still quite a rousing scene. <br /> <br />I got a huge truth to spill: I never saw the original. I've seen snippets of scenes and I have seen IV but let's face it: I was 10 and I forgot most of it. So I can't really comment if this is the best Rocky since the original or a pale comparison. What it is though is a pretty good film andnot the embarassment people thought it'd be, including me. Now, let's see if the Rambo sequel is the same thing.

B000021YCI|5|Deguello is a CD that will change the way you hear music.  This is ZZ  before they sold out and at the peak of their powers.  The production on  this album is so good, that it sounds like it just came out today.  The  tracks are amazing, HiFi Mama just flat out rocks, Fool for your Stockings  is electric blues at its best, and I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide might be the  best song ZZ Top ever wrote.  If you think of ZZ Top just simply for Legs  or Sharp Dressed Man then you have overlooked the heart and soul of this  band.  Deguello is one of the most important rock albums released in the  20th century.  But don't listen to me, buy it and judge for yourself.
B000B8QEZG|5|The album is absolutely fabulous!!! Especially the songs like \\"Hung Up\\", \\"I Love New York\\" and the best of the best - \\"Let It Will Be\\", which is just simply mindblowing!!! Not to mention the perfect mixing of the album, which makes the song start in the previous tracks ending and without gaps feels like it's a one big composition that u just can't get out of...
6305558167|1|I fear I'm going to get an ear bashing when this gets read, and I expect to have just as many people voting against it like my original Dawn of the Dead movie. I LOVED the Merlin TV movie that was made a few years ago with Sam Neill, and that got me interested in seeing other movies about the King Arthur myth/legend. This got recommended, so I really looked forward to watching it. However, I'm sorely disappointed, and hate giving this movie one star, but I can't give it anymore. Anyone who describes this movie as \\"enchanting, bombastic, captivating, breathtaking, operatic\\" to quote another reviewer, was obviously not watching the same movie I was. I strongly suggest you watch Merlin. I don't know why, but the scenery was so much more breath taking, and the characters had more of a prescence about them rather than the ones in Excalibur. Sure, it's the same characters, plus a few other British actors. Merlin in this I felt was almost evil. And the rest of the characters were just dull as dishwater. If I could NOT review this movie, and pretend I did like it, I would, but don't make me sit through anymore King Arthur movies. I'll stick to Merlin and be quite happy.<br /><br />Sorry.

1449410243|4|I love The Oatmeal, so if you enjoy the website you will definitely enjoy this book.  This type of humor is not for everyone, but since I like quirky stuff that doesn't take itself too seriously, it works for me.  I've been pleased with my purchase content/humor wise, and think this would make a good gift.  Though I wish the cover was made of slightly firmer paper, the overall quality of ink/paper/printing is very high.

0312263120|1|It's bad enough that this book seems to have been written by someone who has never seen a computer, much less understands such infosec concepts as viruses, cryptology, and programming.  But even common intelligence community subjects are beyond his grasp  (he claims that there is a single database that holds ALL of the countries secrets... and this database is accessible via dialup connection throughout the world... are you kidding me??)  This book is an insult to anyone who ever took a class in PowerPoint.  If you are a complete computer neophyte however, I still wouldn't recommend this book.  As difficult as it was to get beyond the countless inaccuracies, once I did, the book was dry, and the whole concept was ludicrous.  I can't recommend this book to anyone, the Wizard of Oz is more technically accurate that the drivel this guy spewed.
0385504209|5|Obviously this is one of the most controversial novels in recent history, made even more so depending on one's religious faith and perspective.  This great work is immense and important because of the author's interpretations of theology and history.<br />The codes deal with Da Vinci, his art, history, and theories related to him and the Christian church. I found suspense, conspiracy, imagination, a fast moving plot, great writing, and endless food for thought. He has integrated the mythical gray areas of religion and history into a brilliant thriller. Religious zealots need not read this work as it will either cause them some doubt about their religion or much consternation as they read and become filled with rage.<br />I just finished reading `Crossfire' by Jim Marrs, the highest selling bestseller about the Kennedy assassination and `Alien Rapture' by Edgar Fouche and Brad Steiger, the best selling government conspiracy novel dealing with the UFO cover-up, written by an authenticated credentialed Special Operations `Insider.' So if you like controversy, conspiracy, cover-ups, thrills and great plots, read all three.
B00G15MDI0|5|My wife insisted that I see this. I am usually not a big movie fan so it took some convincing. I am glad she did. The story was creative and well told by polished actors. The cinematography and editing were spot on. It may help that I love books but I got it.
B00BB3UYS8|5|Outview is a Young Adult spiritual fantasy that follows a 16 year old Nathan Ryder on a journey of self discovery. Haunted by horrific dreams, he seeks out his institutionalised elder brother for answers. What follows is a fast paced game of cat and mouse and mystical mystery. I thought Outview had well formed characters and it left me feeling that there was a deeper meaning flowing through the whole story. As the first in a trilogy, Outview has left me wanting more.

B00DMCV7K0|5|Tbh I did not like the author's last book of fiction but I had hope for a comeback and this did not disappoint! I'm only 70% through, but I don't want it to end---a very good sign! Beautifully heartbreaking in parts, dramatic historical moments and some humor. Hope it turns out well :)
B00003CWL6|1|This is the kind of film that Europeans love about America: it has every single ridiculous stereotype about suburban life, from hiding your true feelings from the neighbors to gun-totting nut cases who beat their children.<br />It was so bad that I was stunned at the attention it got.  Not a single scene or emotion rings true.  Is this, along with film versions of cartoons and old TV shows, the best that Hollywood can do?
B001ANSS5K|4|I really liked Paper Towns<br />It is different from The Fault In Our Stars in the sense that the love story is not the main subject of this book. The book is more about accepting yourself for who you are and not expecting others to completely understand what that means. Also, the scenes in which Q disappoints and acts irrationally, makes me doubt the reality of any of the situations. Good book overall though and one I am glad I read.
B0006GVJEE|5|Too Cool
B0067Q42BY|4|Nice puzzle game with a little something extra. Worth downloading. Runs good on my Droid Bionic, but I have experienced a small stutter in game play a couple times.
B001OQCV2E|5|The harsh reality!  People with money can do just about anything.  It would be extremely sad to know 90% of the people and everything else in the world was gone....It really blows your mind if you think about it.
B007T7MIR0|1|It's not very good for me.
0446677450|5|I loved this book; I couldn't put it down.  If you want your money to work for you, instead of constantly working for it, I would strongly recommend this book.
B0013AWUFO|4|Only wish the last song from the movie was on the soundtrack.  Otherwise still great cd.
B004O3YGMC|5|It is good because using it works good when I need it to be working good. I like it. It is good.
0525478817|5|The book was an excellent book and instantly became my favorite book of all time and most likely for the rest of my life (until John Green makes a better one). I feel nothing can surpass how great this book was. I wish I could tell you about the book but I believe you should get the book and read it for yourself because not one letter of the book should be spoiled.  DFTBA to all Nerdfighters
B003IKMR0U|5|I bought this game shortly before going to a convention to give my group something to do in line and it did not disappoint.  This is an easy to learn game that anyone can pick up in a few minutes, and it's small and portable enough that you can play it anywhere.  I'm no dice expert but they seem to be durable enough, they have been dropped from about 6 feet onto a hard concrete surface with no chips or dings that I have seen.  The only issue that I have with this game is the cardboard zombie tube that it comes with.  I would recommend replacing this with a bag instead so you can just draw dice out of it if you are standing and don't have a surface to roll the dice on.  This is by no means a dealbreaker though, I highly recommend this game and the expansion.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Always 5 stars for an Outlander series book. And no matter how long the books are, I am always sad when they come to an end. This one tho, finished with a sense of completeness to the series so that if Ms. Gabaldon doesn't write another one, you are not left 'hanging'.
B008LH4YYC|5|Awesome !!!!
B009VSW15Y|1|I am embarrassed that I bought this app.  It is not a real camera.  You have to hold your kindle over your shoulder and look sideways to see what you are filming.  How dumb.  Last weekend I used a friend's iPad to film our runs at an Agility trial and was very impressed at the ease of use.  AND you don't look stupid trying to record your video.  Wish I had purchased the iPad instead so I could really take pictures and videos without looking like a fool.
B0064MPXFA|4|We enjoy watching several programs in the series. We watch of the Roku we bought from amazon.com and use our Prime membership. It is a great combination.
0385341679|5|The 5th book in the Fever Series.  If you have not read the other 4 books, you will not understand, or appreciate, the delicious answers and continued questions in Shadowfever.  Start with Darkfever.  Oh!  The end to 5 years of questions and theories in the forum!  But wait, it's not!  The Fever Series will continue through other characters!  Karen Moning's plot, character development, twists...sigh.  I can't find the words to express how much I love this series and its characters, or Karen's abilities as an author.  If you enjoy paranormal books with characters who have to earn their place, instead of starting off invincible in leather, then Fever Series is for you!
0316286850|5|I love this book. I have brown eyes and blond hair and do my make up the same everyday... till I got this book.
B004EARTN8|5|It was slow in places but the ending was totally worth it.  I thought it was a pretty good movie.
B000WTLDPU|5|This movie far exceeded my expectations as I had heard it compared to The princess bride which I personally feel got a little confusing with the flashing from reading the story to seeing it.  While I had liked that movie, this movie I love as the story tells itself so gracefully.    Stardust is a delightful fairytale full of adventure, romance, humor, and some violent death scenes not suited for children. The scenery is beautiful...both the real and the special effects. The character development was perfect as knowledge was shown over time and as characters grew.     As one that loves fairytales, this is designed to be a classic and perfect for a home library.  Having it in hd dvd just makes it more visually appealing as the quality is as beautiful as the story.  Each of the characters makes the story what it is but I appreciated that the cast did a great job of bringing each character to life. Whether you like prince, princess, witch, pirate, etc. there is something for everyone as each character has a quest to fulfill often in competition with each other.
B00KTFJ8F4|3|I am very fascinated by the glowing reviews this album is receiving, especially from music critics (who have hated the past two Interpol albums) and fans who are comparing this to Turn On the Bright Lights and Antics, saying those are the only two Interpol albums that are good.<br /><br />This is a very average album, and I feel like their self titled album (which people hate) has songs that are superior in many ways to most of the tracks on this album.  Examples are &#34;Summer Well&#34;, &#34;Memory Serves&#34;, &#34;Try it On&#34;, and &#34;Success&#34;.  I feel like if Interpol held off on releasing their last album, and replaced some of the more experimental (and in my opinion, FAILED) tracks with some of the ones they created while recording &#34;El Pintor&#34;, they would have had a GREAT record.  That is what made &#34;Turn on The Bright Lights&#34; such a great album.  They had so many years to finely craft songs that each had a lot of focus and sounded completely different, and they all fit perfectly on an album.  If they combined those songs from their last album with songs such as &#34;My Blue Supreme&#34; or &#34;Tidal Wave&#34;, we would have something with much more scope.<br /><br />The worst track on this album I think is the opening track and lead single &#34;All the Rage Back Home&#34;.  I feel like songs like this are what makes me embarrassed to like Interpol.  Some of their vocals, lyrics, and droning guitar riffs can be kind of cheesy... but in interestingly crafted songs, there's some kind of &#34;coolness&#34; factor to it.  I guess I felt this way the most when Antics came out.  We were so used to this gloomy, low register voice over the songs on the first album, it definitely sounded different hearing Paul's new vocal style on Antics (higher register, definitely more bold with his strange lyrics).  Evil is a great example of this, it rocks and has a good melody but definitely has some cheesiness in it.<br /><br />The verses to All the RageBack Home and especially the intro sound like a self parody of some of these &#34;cheesy&#34; moments of Antics.  Not the really interesting ideas from Antics (Take You on a Cruise &#34;we sail today, tears drown in the wake of delight, the chorus of C'Mere, Narc).  Songs like &#34;Ancient Ways&#34; also have that self parody feel.  Opening the track up &#34;ooooooooo FUCK the ancient wayyyyyyyyyyyys&#34; definitely seems cheesy and big Interpol fans will know what I mean.<br /><br />I guess this is less of an album review and more of just analyzing this in comparison to their other work (which a review shouldn't be about, but it's VERY interesting hearing how people love Antics and this album, but push aside anything else).<br /><br />Interpol is a really interesting band that has some great ideas, but I think their albums are not as polished as they should be.

Holder is such an amazing person and I wish he was real so I could know him personally. I laughed and cried while reading this book..I'm so glad I purchased it.

Dave Matthews should take this guy to court for ripping him off to the point of even copying his knock-kneed stage moves. If you enjoy Matthews (safe, bland music with lame non-sensical lyrics), you'll love this. How such bloodless, passionless music that sounds if it were made by a eunuch could have such a large female following is very bizzare.

B000BGH22W|3|I like Doyle's flighty tone for this score, but I hate the fact that there's very little subtlety. It's just so noisy and simple. Where's the complexity of John Williams? The whole score pretty much uses the same beat and it grows tiresome after a while.

0307352145|5|Quite: The Power of Introverts in World That Can't Stop Talking is an enlightening and powerful book for either side of the extroverted and introverted spectrum.  Author Susan Cain sheds light on the subject of introversion through a series of stories and begins her work by detailing how the powerful character of the introvert was lost to the outwardly charismatic and powerful extroverted personality.  The book first takes reader through a backdrop of extroversion that can make any self-conscious introvert feel guilty of being themselves.  However, this powerful technique is meant to open the reader's eyes to the cultural constraints placed on introversion in today's American society.<br /><br />Through historical accounts of different introverts, the introverted reader starts to understand how powerful introversion is in forging change and may even find themselves relating to some of the stories.  Extroverted readers, hopefully, see these historical accounts as intriguing and recognize the potential introverts have to catalyze change.  As an extreme introvert I started understanding why I feel uncomfortable in certain instances.  Public speaking or public displays have never been a strong suit of mine unless I can act my way through the situations.  I often need to push myself through this uncomfortable time and when it is over, I feel exhausted beyond understanding.  There have also been times in my life when I feel my \\"social battery\\" powering down.  At this point I become rather \\"grumpy\\" and sometimes unreasonable.  I find I want to hide in my room and take a nap.  As Cain explained, there is nothing wrong with that.  That is how an introvert recharges.  It takes a lot of energy to be social.  Cain also points out that being an introvert does not limit a person to the life of a hermit.  Introverts are perfectly capable of social interaction but she reminds us that introverts are careful speakers who will often listen far more than they will speak.<br /><br />Quiet had a significant impact on me as a reader and I highly recommend it to anyone, introvert or otherwise.  I no longer feel I have to justify myself or make excuses for my lack of social desires.  I understand myself and others around me in a much better way because of Susan Cain's work.  Easily, this can become the introverts \\"self-help\\" or better yet, \\"self-realization\\" guide.et had a significant impact on me as a reader and I highly recommend it to anyone, introvert or otherwise.

B00IHMEAYA|1|Didn't like it, didn't finish it.
1612183956|2|I finished it, and then I said, \\"What the heck did I just read?\\"<br /><br />I was intrigued by the author's comments about being influenced by Twin Peaks, as I too was a big fan of that show.  But if you're looking for something similar to that, look elsewhere, because the only similarity is the town where things are somewhat...strange.<br /><br />Others have recapped the plot, so I won't bore you with that, but I do have a few things to say.  The chase scenes are extremely long and tiresome--I found myself skipping ahead because I don't need to know about every single step this guy takes.  And while there's a decent \\"message\\" at the end, it isn't enough to reward the reader for following Ethan Burke through so many torturous scenes (and torture there is--let this be a warning to squeamish readers, the violence is intense, graphic, and happens  so often that I began to think, really?  He's getting the snot beat out of him AGAIN?!)  Several threads were left dangling.  And speaking of dangling:  was it really necessary for Ethan to be running around naked so often?  Mr Crouch--gratuitous nudity is only good in a visual format.  I didn't want to picture this poor guy running down a street in the middle of the night, stark naked.  Why that was that necessary?  Scene after scene...oops, I have to take my shirt off because it smells.  Oops, my t-shirt is smelly too.  Guess I have to leave my pants on till the next scene.  Oh no, I don't have time to get dressed!  I'm going to rush out in a hospital johnny!  Oh no, it's torn off me and I'm naked again!  Really, stop it.<br /><br />BUT...it kept me reading.  The writing overall is pretty good, if a bit choppy, but Blake Crouch has a distinctive style that others might really enjoy.  Others have said that it's hard to categorize this story and I agree.  It could be horror, sci-fi, post-apocalyptic, or all of the above.  To sum up, I'm glad I read it, but would not seek out more books from this author.
B007MB5OCE|5|A significant step up from water for elephants and entirely delightful. Nine more words are required so I would repeat that
B00006ALGL|5|This is my album of 2002. It proves what a simple thing of beauty can be created by a voice, an acoustic guitar and an aching, heartbreaking melody. \\"Delicate\\" and \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" are absolute bliss.<BR>Damien Rice should become huge, but I almost hope he doesn't - I'd hate to see such a pure and precious talent corrupted by fame. Listen to this and see him live if you can, before intimacy becomes impossible. Treasure him.
B007R11DKQ|4|Good decent family movie!  Good clear story line and no bad language!  I would definitely recommend watching this one with the kids!
B0040I09RM|5|Its addicting

B00B7FXZQS|2|The film was too choppy and made you feel like you were on a small boat. Almost like Rocky over done.
B00KY7PEAA|5|I am loving this game.  It encourages people to be friends and work together.  The graphics and world map is beautiful.  They need to improve in copy/paste and in being able to share reports.  The tiny keyboard with the horrendous kindle autocorrect is my biggest complaint.
B00005JKPF|4|I've been reading the X-Men comic books since the 70's.  I really enjoyed the first movie.  The second one picks up where the last one left off and takes us from there.  It's still primarily focused on Wolverine, but the others do get their share of screen time.<br />After an assassination attempt on the President, a guy named William Stryker is authorized to infiltrate the Xavier School after showing evidence of a military operation beneath the school's surface.  He's really looking for Cerebro, which could be the key to wiping out all mutants<br />I won't give anything away more than that. Just be prepared for a better movie, with a lot more action and better special effects.  Those who know the comics or the animated adventures of the X-Men will get to read between the lines and anticipate would could be coming in future films.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I started watching the series after everyone had been viewing for 1 year... I was behind the curve and had to catch up quick... Soooo I watched all of year 2 and then bought this series and have watched all that I can so far... I knew the ending before the rest of the viewing audience. Wow I love this series and hope for more years of watching... Thanks Amazon for providing me the ability to catch up with the rest of the world....
B000077VR3|5|This movie is a beautiful love story. I love Nicole Kidman as I always have and in this movie she surpassed my expectations. I easily related it to my first and still ever love after over 40 yrs, when I first met Marsha I was 18, and she still is the one for me, though she is married to another she will remain in my heart forever. This movie stirred those longings for my first love. Though some may think the movie was long, I hardly noticed as I enjoyed it so much. I wish I could have seen it on the big screen, but widescreen is good enough. If you like love stories and musicals, you will like this movie. Enjoy it as I did.
B00K2R50RE|3|this game keeps crashing after every goal and I tried to uninstall the reinstall it but that wont work either

B00GST8UB8|5|Loved this one in the 80s and it hold up to the test of time. I guess if anything good came out of the awful remake, it was releasing this one on blu.
B0009I7NNA|5|I have to start out saying I love their self title album and miss The Rev. My goal was to get all their old stuff, starting with this. At first I didn't find myself a big fan, but as time grew, this CD is pretty sweet.   First off, this isn't JUST thrash, even though a big part of it may seem like it. Yes, it is alot different than other metal, but that is why people, including, LOVE IT. If your a newer fan, you must get this album.
B00F91H666|4|I actually enjoyed this movie and thought it was well acted and entertaining.  I was however trying to find some similarities to the book and it didnt really jive to well with what I was expecting.  I am a lover of most things zombie.  I am a big fan of Walking Dead and I had read this book at the urging of a cousin and the book was fantastic.  I know how hard it is to match what people expect in a movie from a book that was so well received so I would give the movie a B- for effort. There are a few lame moments in the movie that I wont rehash here so as not to spoil anything.  I would recommend this movie to someone who just wanted to watch a simple action movie.
0380796090|4|I love books that make me laugh out loud and this one certainly did.  Marian Keyes has created a wonderful story that makes you care about what really happens to Claire.  So much so that I was truly sitting there with  bated breath when James came to Dublin to bring her home and then elated at  the very end with the right-on conclusion.  I'm waiting on Lucy Sullivan  Gets Married from the libary right now.
B00005JOE8|5|I found this movie to be intelligent and engaging.  The characters were fascinating, and my only real problem with the movies is that many of them were never really developed or revealed. <br />  Several people have mentioned to me that they were outraged that V, the main character, was glorified erroneously, that that the movie glorifies terrorism.  While any person who fights a government with violence might be billed as a terrorist (especially by said governement), V seems to focus all of his retribution on members of, and symbols of the facist regime.  He seems to go out of his way to avoid harm to civilians, and it is that tie to his essential humanity that sets him apart as more than just a terrorist. <br />  The dialogue and cinimatography in this movie were beautiful, and I found the story's intelligence a breath of fresh air after the parade of tripe that Hollywood had inundated me with lately.   <br />  While some of my conservative friends rail against this as anti-bush/republican, and my liberal friends hail this as a return to the sixties, I find myself disagreeing with both sets.  This movie targets totalitarianism and intolerant governments more than any one specific regime, and I found the anti-establishment message harkened far less to the marijuana hazed sixties sentiments than to the American revolutionary war. <br />  The message was delivered masterly, and while the movie had its share of violence, it was delivered with tasteful effectiveness instead of the sensory saturation 'gross-out' that marks the average modern action movie. <br />  This is a movie that will hopefully make you thoughtfull, and act as a warning to the dangers of doing nothing and allowing any government or group to manipulate you with fear.  If you leave a theater having been not only entertained, but intellectually stimulated I consider it time well spent. <br /> <br />  Give it a try...
0553565915|1|I read this book because my girlfriend at the time asked me to.  I'm sorry but it was filled with one clich&eacute;' after another.  Unfortunately, the vast armies of the wide eyed faithful will believe every word simply because they have &#34;faith&#34; - which means belief without evidence.  I found the whole story of angels and demons and armies of angels, etc. completely laughable and absurd.  It's garbage like this that perpetuates peoples belief in angels and demons.  Their existence have never been proven.  A rational person would conclude that it is because they don't exist.  Unfortunately, most Americans are not rational.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  This book makes the former but does not provide the latter.
B000BGH22W|5|I love HP and this is a great way to celebrate the greatness of the movie. I mostly listen to this for long roadtrips and while doing homework.
B00004SVID|5|This Album Is one of the best Live albums That I own. I have never found a live album as appealing as this one. The crowds are usually overshadowing the music but this one has very little crowd noise during the songs. The  Version I have had 2 booklets with interviews and pictures. The Interviews  with the band members give even more background about The Wall and what it  means to the band members and the people who organized the performances. A  must get for fans of Floyd!
B0070ZLZ1G|5|Great book! Gave me a lot of insight on how to raise my own daughter. It also gave me a good idea of other programs that work.
B00BC5I6Q2|3|The very promising first three episodes successfully transposed the original English, brilliant, dark humor political satire. Thereafter it simply reverted to typical bloated off-the-shelf plot and dialog soap opera. By episode 9 some of the dialog was so inept it challenged the actors to maintain credibility.<br />This is what you get when cinematographer, director, producer and writer(s) change every episode. Impossible to maintain character and plot credibility because the actors simply stand as mouth pieces for whatever is put in front of them for that episode. No character development, no sharp, incisive, suspense-filled plot development. Spacey (F.U.) is perfectly cast  as the American equivalent of the original brilliant Richardson's Urqhart.  But that's about all there is to it.<br /><br />Presumably he gets paid very well to phone in a caricature of Kevin Spacey being Kevin Spacey. The rest of the characters are as believable or credible as any in any soap opera.<br /><br />The original series &#34;suggested&#34; more than it stated, and that was part of the engagement and &#34;fun&#34; of the series. This  version grinds out in mundane detail every possible (ripped from today's news) factoid, spiced with the occasional soft porn.  And that is not fun, nor entertaining, nor engaging.<br /><br />Three stars because: If you enjoy soap opera, this is fine. If you enjoy a &#34;realistic&#34; portrayal of the the political fiction we are fed by the news media, this is fine.<br /><br />I watched series one and, being an optimist, watched series two. It didn't get any better. Time to move on to other things.

ALL OF US NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AUTHOR MICHAEL POLLAN IS SAYING ABOUT INDUSTRIAL AND 'ORGANIC' FOODS AND TO SUPPORT A POLYFACE APPROACH TO FOOD PRODUCTION.

B00AJER3SE|5|I've been waiting for this movie to come out on Blu-ray for quite some time. I was hesitant to buy it due to some of the reviews I read on Amazon about the other version(s). When I finally read the reviews on this version, I bought it right away. The picture is great for a movie made back in '84! It almost looks as good as T2 when it first came out. The sound is better than I thought it would be. If you're a die hard Blu-ray buff and like to be REAL picky about the quality of 30 year old movies working on 21st century technology, then you'll probably lose some sleep on this one. But for the rest of us, it's a winner!

I have it on my phone and tablet and it works great.  being able to change the card backs and background is pretty cool but when I tried to change the background to a picture on my Asus Transformer, it would not work.  Very, strange, but no big deal.   Asus Transformer and Samsung Fascinate.
B009MF5BXK|2|The draw to this film is the cast...all the greats of action flicks.  However, Bruce Willis is but a few brief minutes in the story, and then disappears. Jason Stratham is his usual best in any film he participates in.  Dolph Lundgren is genuinely repulsive, both in character and non-acting ability.  The biggest downer is to see Sly Stallone....at all.  He was engaging in his early  action films....ASSASINS, GET CARTER, the ROCKY franchise,and he somehow survived such material as the \\"clifff\\" movie with John Lithgow who stole the show, as he is wont to do.<br />Here, in the EXPENDABLES IS TRULY IS THAT...EXPENDABLE...!!!  His body hardly looks made for heaving around as he wants us to believe he can(not)...His mumbling has become disconcerting.  His facial expressions are missing.  It was a bitter disappointment
B007MNV5WU|3|ok so I paid for the full version when it first came out and have been waiting for updates. on other devices there is the whole version plus the danger zone free and I play the first stage in danger zone then have to pay for the rest? why???
B00CNQ7HAU|3|Although it was well written, it only took one chapter to know where this story was going.  The storyline was way to close to &#34;Time To Kill.&#34; I began to lose interest when the end unfolded just like I had predicted.
B00IX9UTLU|5|I really enjoyed this series.  This is the first time I read anything by Laurelin Paige and I am now a fan.  Thanks for the suggestion Amazon!
B00UPSUYU8|5|AMAZING!!!!!!!
B00IKZX1ZI|5|Entertaining for kids and adults alike! The story of unconditionally loving yourself for who you are as well as others is timeless.
B008YKGQR4|4|A good approximation of the PC version. Still doesn't have the full flexibility and functionality but is adequate enough most of the time.
B0000DD7LB|4|What bothers me when it comes to Britney is how people who don't even like her to begin with will put in their two cents when it comes to her music.  Sure, she may not have the greatest voice, she admits that herself.  Sure, she lip syncs maybe a little too much. But who cares, she puts on an awesome energetic show.  If you don't like her, close your ears or listen to something else. \\"In The Zone\\" is a music extravaganza chocked full of sexiness, and not the overt \\"Dirrty\\" kind.  I am sure she didn't set out to make a Carol King \\"Tapestry\\" or Fleetwood Mac \\"Rumours\\", but who cares.  Music shouldn't have to always be so \\"will it be a classic 40 years from now?\\"  Big deal, let the girl have some fun. It's a much better cd then her last three.  If you liked \\"I'm A Slave...\\", you'll like the whole cd.  Standouts are \\"Boom Boom\\", \\"Toxic\\", \\"Outrageous\\", and the ballad \\"Everytime\\".  If you are not a Britney fan, never have been and you consider yourself \\"anti-Brit\\", don't even bother listening to the cd.  But if you want something interesting and unique and aren't afraid of a little sexiness, give it a whirl, you may be surprised at just how catchy the songs really are.
B008JFUO72|5|great movie...received item quickly
B002KEZ96Y|1|Horrible?  I like Jeff Bridges and expected a mature comedy.  Unfortunately you would have to be between the ages of 15-23 to enjoy this movie.  I knew I was in trouble when Lebowski said he goes by the name \\"Dude\\".  I made it through about 2/3rds of the movie and then gave up and didn't finish it.
B0055PGUYU|4|This book was interesting... especially all of the different aspects of habits. I was fascinated by the part about plane crashes and pilot communication. Not really what I expected to learn about going into the book, but it definitely made me think differently about a range of subjects.
B000UVT3OI|5|what can I say about this cd that has not been said,  Garth was the pioneer in 'flying' across the crowds during concerts , he was the greatest at that time and still is today.  Will buy from this seller again
B006IGZWB2|2|Okay, I was born in the 50's in the south, although not the deep south.  I tried to like the book, and I tried to be open minded about the movie, and I couldn't warm up to either one.  Nobody had to tell me that the author was NOT born in this time period, it was very evident.  I don't remember ANYBODY who actually looked like these characters or who acted like this.  It just didn't happen.  An enormous &#34;fail&#34; as far as believability.  She's tried to use 60's social issues as a vehicle to make the rest seem realistic.  It barely works.  I lost interest in the book well before the end.  The movie was slightly better, probably because there were many artists involved in making it, but it just was a huge disappointment.  Not entertaining.
B0089EHWQE|5|Excelent book
6303422020|5|Yesssss, they don't make 'em like this too often. This movie is truly bone-chilling! I love all 3 stories on here, the best one is definitely The Raft, followed by The Hitchhiker, and last but not least The Indian story.  Rent this baby, or better let, just buy the freakin' tape, watch it super  duper late, and sit back and embrace True horror! This one is alot better  than the 1st one. The Raft story alone is worth buying, have the pleasure  of viewing this enormous-grotesque looking blue blob that floats in the  water, and is in desperate need of some fresh blood! The 4 scared teens  have to escape this death trap somehow... Some other movies worth checking  out are... Necronomicon:Book of The Dead, Bodybags. Creepshow 2 rules!
B00004REF1|5|I LOVE This Movie! The Movie Came EXACTLY How It Was Described! Thank You :)
B008YZXYY2|5|i love this new cd from ston sour my fav track are last of real drosy god and the first 11 cant wait for pt. 2
B000FCKC4C|5|this is my all time favorite book.  I have read it at least 8 times.  every time I learn something new.  you will love it
B00IRISI42|5|Exciting read and an enjoyable finish.
B00000J7JO|3|I wasnt hugely impressed with this CD. That doesnt mean its a bad CD. But its different. Its not quite Blood Sugar and its not quite By The Way. Its basically a bridge for their transition from rap rock to melodic rock. Some people would like the mix, but not me.<br />This album actually has some good songs. Californication is okay, Around the World is okay, Scar Tissue is great... Its just that theres too many okay songs and not enough great ones. Therefore, although its not a bad effort, it doesnt keep me listening to the CD. At times I think it gets very boring. Its not hard at all. I often turn it on when I'm going to sleep. However, the CD would appeal to some people. Die-hard Chili Peppers fans should get it, and so should people who like not all that hard rock. Just be prepared for a different sound.<br />Closing Comments:Are their lyrics meant to make any sense at all?
B0047SF41G|2|My son wanted to watch this because he was in the mood for a sci fi movie. He actually fell asleep mid way through it. That should tell you something about this movie. Also look at the list of &#34;stars&#34; in the movie. Adrian Brody (?), Danny Trejo and the dude from &#34;The 70s Show&#34;. Reading some of the reviews I question whether we watched the same movie as they did, but some people seemed to enjoy it.
B0031KE9C6|5|my wife watches it she loves.
B0079R8KXG|5|Easy to put on and use, and does a great job of protecting the kindle.  Wished it had come in yellow, since I'm  Steeler Fan
B00447G29S|5|It's already a great movie as is, but the 3D is one of the best I've seen for home entertainment. If you're into it. It's a must buy.
0060558121|4|The main character is a man called Shadow. He just made it out of prison and is excited to get home to his wife. Unfortunately, the night before he's released he finds out his wife died in a car accident with his best friend. Now Shadow has no ties to the real world, and he makes the acquaintance of a business man named Mr. Wednesday, who offers Shadow a job. Through Mr. Wednesday Shadow meets many strange and unusual people, but the funny thing is that Shadow seems to fit in with them.<br />I know there are a lot of metaphors and religious messages in this book, but don't look at me for what they are because I was not thinking that deeply while I read it. Mostly I enjoyed the book. The only time I didn't was when I felt I was supposed to know the people/Gods that Shadow or Mr. Wednesday were talking to. I felt a little confused at the ending; it felt like there was too many people in the pot.<br />As a character, I liked Shadow and related to him through most of the book except(warning this may spoil the ending for you) when he returns at the end. I just couldn't understand why he would come back after being done with the world. I just didn't see it happening.<br />In the end, I enjoyed the story and the characters, and I would read the sequels and short stories connected to American Gods.
B00003CXB4|5|I was very pleased with the condition of the product.  It was shipped in a timely manner and the condition was as stated \\"new\\".  Though many said I payed to much for it, seeing that it is no longer offered in stores and there were many who wanted more for the same product, I was very pleased with everything.
B00G4EXNNM|5|Almost as good as the Everlys.
1780674880|5|What a stunningly beautiful book!  Amazing detail and surprises throughout. Plus it's very big. There's also a puzzle to it which makes it a lot of fun. I just opened the box and am in awe!  I'm new to the world of adult coloring books and this has me sold. I'm going to order another to send to a college aged niece--she'll love it!
B0032UYFA6|5|this was a fantastic show I enjoyed this season as much as I have enjoyed all the others thus far
0805095535|3|I have wanted to read all of Paul Auster's books, including Winter Journal. When the word \\"winter\\" is in the title, then I expect something about the \\"winter of life,\\" meaning, of course, life in the older years, let's say, 77-88??? (For those people who are not aware of this, and are perhaps too young to hear this, then take care of these words: it is not fun to be older knowing what will happen in a few years). Well, Auster at 65 is hardly in this category of old or older age, in my opinion. Usually I remember whole books when an author such as Auster writes, but I hardly remember this book, except that I feel that his other books are better than this one. Auster gave us in his book snippets from his life, but why are we interested, except to find some value in the kind of life he lived. I did not find universal themes, so sorry to say. Mr.Auster, please forgive this unpleasant review: I hope that other people like the book and recommend it to others. Nancy S
B002G1YPH0|5|This is the second Hyper 212 Plus that I have used, the first on a 1155 board which had no install issues no matter which direction<br />the cooler was rotated. However on my second 1150 board I could only install the cooler with it's width facing the top of cpu case<br />because the cooler makes contact with cpu clamp when aligned width wise with the RAM slots.
B00CWY76CC|5|This is a good app and its challenging and time consuming if you need something fun to do. It's well put together and has great graphics.
B006LSZECO|5|First chapter is odd, but once you get past that, you can't stop reading it!
B001NHN7TU|5|Fun and story moves right along. Handymen and side kicking off each other,its great. Gross and Reba (guns guns guns). And the Monster great movie.  thanks agian Amazon  LJ
B000FC1JAI|2|This was a little cumbersome to read.  I read &#34;The Obstacle is the way&#34; and really enjoyed it but this is a tome.  This seems just the daily recordings of Marcus not an application instruction book.  Everything thought is an insight.  this needs to be explained.
B003DZX3SA|5|Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney movie. I was very pleased with the quality of this film. And I am so happy that I was able to order it from Amazon even though this film has went back into the vault. Thank you!!
0783225482|3|With the talent here, one would expect a fabulous film. But only Goldie Hawn carries it out. The irony is that the two who hate each other the most are doomed to be together for eternity.
B00R2LZ41K|5|I loved it!
B00M5MBOG0|4|Not what I was expecting. Good story, classic but not as good as I remember.

B00DR0PDNE|5|I spend time to figured out finally after a little struggle to connect my moto g then ipad to hdmi.  Finally works and enjoy the espn.
B0031KC8OC|5|I had wanted to watch this for years, because Kristen Bell is one of my favorites.  She is terrific as Veronica.  Smart dialog, engaging plotline.  Thanks for including it on Prime,  Amazon! Can't wait for the movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Excellent show
B002KDUDG6|5|From the first note of this gift box of music, I knew I was in for a ride!  A fan of Buble's from his beginnings, I listened with my eyes shut so as not to miss a note...also, without looking at the song list so each one would be a surprise.  The opener \\"Cry Me a River\\" done in spooky Spiderman style and obviously arranged by David Foster made goosebumps on the top of my head instead of on my arms.    Perfection in Foster's arrangements and perfection in Michael's interpretations of each gift make this album stellar. You critics be sure to watch the Grammys.  I predict this album and some of the individual songs on it will bring multiple nominations for Michael and David.  I have a pretty good track record of predicting Grammy winning songs and albums from the first minute I hear them.  Wish I could bet with you.    As for Michael's voice, anyone familiar with it couldn't miss it from the first few seconds you hear of it.  He may have a 'potty mouth' when he's talking (maybe he's cleaning that up) but there is no other Michael Buble' when he's singing! And I'm thrilled to hear him reaching down into the lower baritone range on this album.  Yow!
B00C7KXUOE|5|Another show recommended to me by my sister, Hannibal could be her best choice yet. It's well cast, despite my original hesitation concerning the good doctor himself. It isn't that Mikkelsen is bad, I was just unsure how well he could carry the torch so well lit by Anthony Hopkins - thankfully he does it well, and even brings something to the character that may have been missing. Both leads are very well portrayed, and have a strong supporting cast. The show is surprisingly graphic, especially for a network tv show. I don't want to give any spoilers, but this is taking place before the events of Red Dragon, centered around the \\"friendship\\" and working relationship between Will Graham, and Dr. Hannibal Lecter and each episode deals with smaller bait while encompassing a larger story arc over the season. It's well directed and the mood is mostly somber. It does fall a little into the American tv trap of mostly casting the bold and beautiful, but doesn't distract from it. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys darker shows such as American Horror Story, Dexter, Whitechapel, or possibly even Sherlock.
B002O320TA|4|If you are a Mr. Bean fan you will enjoy the antics of Johnny English. Rowan Atkins is England's national treasure
B0058VW36U|5|cut the rope is super addictive! I just love the game! &lt;3 there is nothing wrong with it, but it can be hard.. I think it is cool how you can switch from candy, Donut, and cupake! I highly require u you to get this app! ;)

B006VRDZ44|5|Riveting television.
B00FHB2XB6|1|My 5 year old got this for Christmas. She asked for it because the pictures looked good. After playing with it for 5 minutes, she declared, &#34;This is a plastic piece of junk!&#34; None of the parts fit together right. Disney and Mattel: this product is an utter shame.
B000002MX7|4|Should have more Rufus tunes on it to be a real best of collection.  Still, Chaka has had her share of great songs.
B00MIA0KGY|5|It's Barbara....
B009B8YZKS|5|They really impressed.  Not a low budget but for a studio that isn't in the &#34;big leagues&#34;, they definitely impressed.  If you are a Halo fan - get this movie.
B00ATSBIIG|5|Great Game. Lots of fun to play.
B000QGAU4E|4|I really enjoyed it very much
0811879542|5|I got this book for Christmas and my daughter loves it. All the pages are interactive and she giggles the whole way through. It is a lovely little book and one of our new favorites.
B00004VVNB|4|This movie is just plain fun.  The story is a good one, the acting is passable more often than not, and the special effects are often so dated and cheesy as to feel nostalgic.  I first saw this film when I was a child and I remembered much more than I would have imagined possible.  With a child the most important aspects of a film are plotting and interesting characters, and that is what this film has in spades.  The fact that brassiers are out of style in the 23rd century also makes for a promising future. ;)  Michael York plays a Sandman named Logan, a police character who hunts down and 'terminates' what are called 'runners.'  Members of this enclosed society who have come of age (30-years-old) are up for possible 'renewal' in an event called 'Carrousel.'  Those who are of age that do not show up at 'Carrousel' are considered 'runners.'  Michael York (an upstanding Sandman) is summoned by the great machine that oversees this seeming Utopia and is given a mission that requires he be thought of as a 'runner' to gain the trust of unacquired 'runners' still at large throughout the city.  As a result, his final four years as a citizen is wiped away and he starts to consider the possibilty that the great machine is not 'renewing' anyone at all, but that they all die in 'Carrousel.'  The seed of doubt is sewn in his mind and \\"Logan's Run\\" begins.  The miniatures used as buildings, etc. are all fake-looking but are still great to look at, the special effects are often laughable, but the story is good and the film is ultimately entertaining all the way to the last scene.  Recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|1|Before even figuring out how it works, you want a dollar for me to continue!!  Nope. At least this was easy to quit, unlike your Sims game.
B005OCFGTO|5|What can I say? I love Harry Potter!
B00AREIAI8|5|Very fun! Passes time. Not too childish to play and doesn't make you pay for coins etc, you can earn them which is nice!
B00417HV14|2|I have owned both the DVD and this new Blu-ray.  True:  the DVD is exceptional!!  Awesome video and audio!  The Blu-ray audio is same...Great!  BUT, the video quality on the Blu-ray is WORSE than the DVD!  Especially the white or light sections such as Joe's face....Very fuzzy and pale.  TOTALLY disappointing.  Do NOT upgrade your DVD for Blu-ray in this case....NOT worth it.
B004MC8CA2|4|There are many Bible apps out there but this is one of the best.  Works really well on the Kindle fire.

B009GQ57ES|5|MACKLEMORE IS AMAZING!!!
0765365286|5|My biggest problem with Game of Thrones was that everything seemed to get away from Martin.  The story.  The characters.  The world.  While, I loved The Way of Kings, I was worried that these books would also degrade in a similar manner.  This is only the second book, but so far so good!  This book is just as good as the first.<br /><br />It seamlessly continued the story, but changed the focus.  Shallan gets the highlights and flashbacks, and she is an incredibly interesting person.  Her background is complex and not all fun and games.  Besides that we get glimpses of the other potential Radiants and they are as diverse as any group.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first, I would definitely tell you to pick up this one.  Meanwhile, I will eagerly await third!

6304936362|5|It has all the new \\"RAT PACK\\" from the 90's and 2000.  It was good and one of the best WWII movies for airplane battle fights I ever saw.  It is not the documentary and that has an awesome review too, my friend 43 yrs service retired now Aircraft mechanic wanted this for his birthday and said \\"It was one of the best MOVIE dogfights I have ever seen!\\"  This man went through Veitnam and Korea.  Full of tons of stars that we all know most became famous all star cast and a story well told and lived.
B00005JLKB|3|When Smallville first debuted, I was initially skeptical of the premise. It was one thing to delve into Clark Kent's psyche (as did the earlier Lois ans Clark) but not being a fan of my own small town existence, I wondered what a pre-Superman cannon addition could seriously offer myself other than brooding good looks.<br />Vauglely remembering the Dukes of Hazzard from my own early childhood, I also wondered what strange grip John Schneider had on hollywood (incriminiating conversations, photos..etc) to cast him as Jonathan \\"Pa\\" Kent, who should (by all accounts) be a heavyset bespectacled older man. Annette O'Toole (Lana from the movies) is a generally agreeable choice for Martha \\"Ma\\" Kent in the tradition of intra-franchise joking, but the two seem too sophisticated for the roles, even by previous series standards which made it clear open-minded people lived in all areas of the country (including small-town family farms).<br />Also problematic is the series repeated inistence that Smallville is only a short distance from Metropolis when it has been previously established on the East Coast (approximately where New York City resides)in numerous earlier Superman incarnations (his being able to travel home in minutes for counseling from the parents).<br />Reeling from Buffy's untimely cancelation, I managed to find some captivating portions of this series which would be memorable for anybody willing to wade through and/or overlook the earlier mentioned nitpicks. This series obviously borrows heavily from the long-established DC franchise, but it also subtlely infuses a healthy dose of sophisticated political commentary.<br />Hinting at the real-life current challenges facing many students with disabilities and/or GLBT students, Clarks parents encourage him to be careful whom he tells the truth about himself to in their small 'close-minded' town and to remember his physical limitations (in his case being stronger than others, and/or staying away from the meteor rocks which dot the landscape and provide much of the challenges). Being different in a small town is different, and periodically stiffling for teens who do not fit a pre-defined cookie-cutter ideal, but internal strength (self esteem) immeasurably helps find your way through (and yourself in) the tourtorous ordeal.<br />Partly as a result of this same leveling experience, Clark develops great empathy for others and concern for social justice---later becoming the famed \\"Man of Steel\\".<br />In one episode which remains eerily reminicent of the real-life murder of University of Wyoming college student Matthew Shepard, Clark is [unclothed] and tied to a fence post by the popular Smallville High jock in retailiation for making eyes at his long-time crush Lana Lang.<br />Because Lana is still in the phase where she wears a fragment of the meteor rock around her neck in memory of her dead parents, Clark cannot physically get near her for most of this season without getting ill.<br />Indicative of his future with Lois Lane (of the Terri Hatcher era), we also meet Chloe Sullivan, the editor of the high school newspaper, the Torch who favors herself a cross between Woodward/Bernstein and Gloria Steinem. Lana's polar opposite in both dress and demeanor, Chloe suspects there is far more going on in the town than what the authority figures are telling her, but cannot yet figure it out despite her most persistent intentions (which are amazingly accurate in many instances). Even at this point in his life, Clark recognizes he is attracted to strong and independent-minded women, but cannot himself figure out how to reveal his idenitity without being reduced to [strange] status on her infamous \\"Wall of Weird\\" and presumably carted away to a research lab. If taking history seriously, he's eventually supposed to go out with Lana, but I really want to see these two together instead and think the resultant generated plotlines would be more interesting.cks which dot the landscape and provide much of the challenges).

B0082XJGRK|4|I have gotten so much heartfelt wisdom from this book... it was surprising to me that a ruler from his era would be so down to earth and caring!  We need for some of our government officials to read and consider what Marcus Aurelius felt, considered, and acted on in his life. Perhaps there would be more caring for &#34;the people&#34; than there is.
B00005JNPZ|5|Hitch shows Will Smith at his best - funny, original and at times sophisticated. As Alex Hitchinson (short Hitch), he is the date doctor who shows poor souls how to impress women and treat them well. <br />While helping other men as a 'private consultant', Hitch has to take some of his own medicine when he finds Sara (Eva Mendes). The visually appealing couple hits it off after some smart but sincere moves on the part of Hitch. <br />Without wanting to spoil any of the essential parts of this movie, it's a hilarious flick for guys, girls, couples and just everybody interested in a quick LAUGH that lasts the whole two hours :)) <br /> <br />The dance scene at the end is hilarious. <br />New York looks beautiful in many scenes.

B000002MUW|4|This was Madonna's, follow up to Erotica. I feel that Erotica is a classic, Bedtime story, however does not meet Eroticas greatness.<br />  Still the cd, is worth the buy. Survival, Don't Stop, Sanctuary, are among my favorites.<br /><br />  The singles, Secret,and Take a bow, were overplayed. Still they are good.<br />  I prefer the singles Human Nature, and Bedtime story.<br />  Bedtime Story, is awesome, because it is so different.<br />  The song Inside of me, is a song about Madonna's mother, who died when Madonna was only 7. I love it, because it reminds me of my father who died.

0385504225|3|I was disappointed  in the ending.  The lead-up was great, but a dissappointing ending.  I was hoping for much better!
B002PYW26O|4|Just kidding! It was a fun adventure back into the cinematic world of the late-nineties when this cgi was cutting-edge. Even by today's standards, the visual effects are pleasing and the overall movie is upbeat and entertaining. There are times that the dialogue feels a bit rough but that doesn't stop it from being fun and engaging. Grab some popcorn and enjoy!
6303234844|5|My husband and I were getting ready to walk out the door when the concert started on the Disney channel. We couldn't tear ourselves away during the first song, or the second, or the third.... After standing in front of the  TV for about 15 min we gave in, turned up the stereo and settled in. It was  THE BEST CONCERT I HAVE EVER SEEN. I've bought every CD I've seen of his  since then, but my favorite is still Secret World double CD.  I'm torn  between playing it LOUD and conserving my hearing.

B002BRRTUO|5|This is a great classic movie. Don't expect modern sci-fi action. It has a campy old comicbook feel with a legendary soundtrack by Queen. Anyone who remembers this movie loves it. Showed it to my kids and they loved it too.

B002JVWQSW|5|Already a classic in just two years!  After watching a few episodes of the second season, we just had to see what we missed in its first emmy-award-winning premier season.  The writing and sets cannot be matched.  Thanks to rapid-fire dialog and unbeatable acting by THE PERFECT actors for each role, the plot/plots race ahead, and before you know it, that record player is in front of you and it's over for another episode, your face hurts from laughing so hard, and you're thinking about a line(s) of dialog that especially cracked you up.  Thank you, Amazon, for an excellent DVD!

B00HUNP5F0|3|I'm not a sci-fi movie person at all.... but I heard this was a great movie and I absolutely loooove Vin Diesel.  This movie was kind of weird, just as I expected, but the graphics were great.  I would not watch this again though, not because it was bad, but because I'm not into sci-fi movies.
B00006L90T|5|Scenario: What would you do if you were suddenly plunged into a world where you didn't belong?<br /><br />&#34;Carnival of Souls&#34; was presented originally as a drive-in horror flick for teen consumption. However, it certainly was superior to the usual fare of the time. Had it been filmed in Europe instead of America, it may have even been given the status of an arthouse classic. It's maker, Herk Harvey, was a specialist in industrial films and, as the story goes, he made this &#34;B&#34; movie cheaply as somewhat of an experiment to see what he could do in broader cinema. In Harvey's only concession to glamour, he introduces the story with pretty young ladies and that serves as an obvious hook for the mostly adolescent-targetted audience the film would have initially reached. &#34;Carnival of Souls&#34; may have, in part, been inspired by a &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episode called &#34;The Hitchhiker&#34;. Be that as it may, this film really works.<br /><br />Brief synopsis: A young woman thinks she has survived a car accident. Then, on a dark and lonely road trip, there appears a ghostly stranger who follows her everywhere and demands her hand in a macabre dance that takes place in a derelict carnival site. Mary tries to put this aside as an illusion brought on by the shock of her accident... or perhaps she is the victim of a stalker? So, after having arrived in a new state, our heroine attempts to work a normal job and lead a normal life. However, she periodically loses touch with the stream of life around her, seeming to go out of existence as far as the world is concerned. In one of these dissociation episodes, Mary is directed to a departure gate and, anticipating a way out, instead finds a bus loaded with souls who want to spirit her away. She flees from them and arrives at another gate but when she attempts to go through it, it is locked by the gate-keeper. Another interesting element is introduced when we find Mary in the dressing-room of a clothing store. She is initially unable to manipulate the lock, as if she still feels trapped in the car and trying desperately to get out: simple tasks have come to reflect her trauma. In fact, hardly anything in her world is what it once seemed. For example, the people appear as typical yokels but may hide a transcendental role as angels and demons directing her strange new journey (take special note of her annoying neighbor, Mr Linden, emerging from the waters with the other souls near the end of the drama). Mary is regularly drawn to the abandoned carnival site and wanders the grounds, alone and bewildered, occasionally startled by echoes of life once abundant there. She no longer feels an attachment to living people because she has become separated from her soul and is now a phantom, haunting her own world. This is a problem that needs to be resolved, so the characters in her strange new environment must play their part in uniting her with her soul and its brethren in death, a process she resists with the determination of one clinging to the last, thin threads of life. Mary Henry - Henry Mary, the name is interchangeable as everyman and the plot is emblematic of the dead warrior's journey in purgatory... The ending is less important; it only serves to complete the circle.<br /><br />&#34;Carnival of Souls&#34; is more ghost story than &#34;B&#34; horror. It is themed on dread and isolation; of being &#34;dragged&#34; into a corporeal nightmare, and so doesn't require the obligatory violence that attempts to shock the audience with scenes of blood-curdling murder. The eerie tale seems almost innocuous at first, but eventually inveigles its spell into the viewer's sub-conscious. I must admit, it got into my dreams once or twice, as did the creative music and some of the better cinematography.<br /><br />Depending on the temperament of the viewer, this film could also be regarded as a dark comedy when seen from the perspective of a girl being pursued for her charms and talents by both the living and the dead, in a grotesque &#34;tug of war&#34;. However, I prefer to think of it as existential horror rather than a veiled farce.<br /><br /> &#34;Carnival of Souls&#34; has a few flaws in both script and filming but this can be excused due to the lack of financial resources available in its making. In spite of its &#34;home made&#34; appearance and some mediocre acting, this supernatural tale is surprisingly nuanced and hence highly recommended. Make sure it's the  black and white, 1962 director's cut.<br />Yes, it could have been done more professionally, but what do you want for 35 thousand dollars? This film deserves 5 stars for achieving so much with so little.y both the living and the dead, in a grotesque &#34;tug of war&#34;.

B00AKO93JK|5|Really works you out!
B00005JKOI|3|1986 brought the third of three John Hughes / Molly Ringwald movies, \\"Pretty in Pink\\", and I'm afraid it's the worst of the three. <br /> <br />The storyline asks us to suspend disbelief over and over again, Molly's character seems weak and childish at times, and Jon Cryer is just annoying as the misfit \\"Duckie\\". <br /> <br />I am a huge Molly Ringwald fan, but \\"Pretty in Pink\\" is certainly a step down from the heights of \\"The Breakfast Club\\" and the pinnacle of \\"Sixteen Candles\\". <br /> <br />On a side note, Annie Potts is great (as usual) in a supporting role. <br /> <br />\\"Pretty in Pink\\" will be a necessary purchase for any 80s, Brat Pack, Hughes, or Ringwald fan, but it lacks a certain \\"something\\" that the other movies seem to have.
B008Y720JU|5|Only heard about this from a rental preview but thought it looked interesting so we rented it and loved it. Ewan McGregor is such a cutey and it was so different from many movies today. It had a wonderful message and kept our interest throughout.
B003G4W49C|4|The text was very good with lots of good lit The best book in years I call it but a little bit to long
B005LAII80|5|Simply fun...with a great dark/dirty feel to it that is not your typical post-apocalyptic story.  Karl Urban represents Dredd in a way that fans of the graphic novels will appreciate. And for those who are new to this universe, enjoy the trip...

0316143472|3|Here you will find essays as funny as anything Sedaris has ever written.  Unfortunately you will also find some of the most self-indulgent.  When Sedaris writes of relationships -- with family and friends and lovers -- we can relate.  He takes the ordinary and stretches it to the absurd, often tapping into secret feelings and emotions we thought only we had, and that makes us laugh at him and ourselves.  But when Sedaris takes several months off to quit smoking and rents an apartment in Tokyo, as he does for about the last third of the book, he loses something.  It's not that he has to smoke and be high to be funny (he doesn't), it's that most of us don't have the time or the dough for such extravagant vacations.  We have jobs and we have bills.  When Sedaris becomes not an exaggerated one of us, but a neurotic twit with so much money and fame he can slap his name on the cover of anything and know we will buy it, it is hard not to feel a bit duped.  The last section of the book is mostly a collection of paragraphs, not essays.  It feels lazy.  It's hard to imagine anyone outside of his loyal fans (I consider myself one) finding any pleasure here.  In the beginning the Sedaris wit says, \\"Look at us.  Aren't we funny.\\"  Here, Sedaris is simply saying, \\"Look at me.  Look at me.\\"  The joke is growing stale.  I am reminded of Picasso, who in his last years would scribble on paper, sign his name, and laugh all the way to the bank.  \\"I am so brilliant, I deserve this.\\"
B00GY0HJ4K|5|Easy  to use  Fun. Long plan time without costing money.  Makes you use strategy with out realizing it. Fun for all ages
B0050CQY1W|1|Our expectations from our \\"stars\\" are so low.  I can't image anyone actually enjoying this music and this is another example of how someone name sells instead of their talent. We must demand more. Black music has always left its mark on the world -- how does this compare to the very talented artist that has come before. Very disappointing.
B006S08RLU|5|A beautiful, quirky, feel-good foreign flick, full of interesting characters with charming flaws. Great cinematography and music. And of course, Audrey Tautou is adorable. This is one of a very few movies that I can watch more than once. The traveling garden gnome from Travelocity... this is where he comes from!
B004SJ3BCI|5|Great fun! Helps get your mind off of the troubles of the day. I would highly recomend it to others.
030758836X|2|Fairly good story line until the end.  The ending ruined the whole book.  I wish I could get my money back.
B004ZRV3AU|4|Great product.  Works well to score round glass bottles.  Takes a little practice to get the scoring right.  The trick is to use oil every 2-3 bottles on the diamond tip and apply even pressure when scoring.  I've made some really great decorations with old bottles.
B000002NJS|5|After a four year gap since her last studio album, the R&B flavoured Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna returned to the studios in 1998 and came up with some of her most stunning, artistic and compelling work. The album would go under the title, Ray Of Light and encapsulated a multitude of styles - Dance/Techno/Indie. The project would be produced by Madonna herself with the aid of Dance master, William Orbitt.  <br /> <br />Ray Of Light (1998) opens with the hypnotic sounds of Drowned World/Substitute For Love. The track is mellow in it's content and shifts tempo midway through the recording. Madonnas vocal delivery is soft, sensual and warm.  <br /> <br />Swim is another tempo shifting number that is utterly compelling whilst zooming in on the swirling psychedelic vibe is the fantastically upbeat, Ray Of Light. Madonnas voice is impeccably strong, seemingly delivering this with a vengenace. Ray Of Light became a monster dance-floor filler that remains as startling as it was on its origanal release.  <br /> <br />There is a startling combination of Indie/Rock/Dance on the bizarre Candy Perfume Girl. Though not quite having the immediacy of some of the other recordings on here, still has significant musical merit.  <br /> <br />More adventurous was the hypnotic, trance-like effect on the stark, Skin which contains vast undertones of red hot, pulsating dance and Madonnas performance sounds heavenly. Skin like most of the other recordings on here is hauntingly atmospheric and has such immediacy.  <br /> <br />The album then swerves and steers back into a more commercial sound with the bouncy,upbeat, Nothing Really Matters which is utterly infectious and a guaranteed dance-floor filler.  <br /> <br />One of the ultimate highlights on this album has to be the stark, Sky Fits Heaven which has a more hardcore effect. Complete with thrashing guirtars and bizarre, synchronised effects, the track is one of the most memroable recordings on the album. A far cry from the sweet popsounds of Holiday and Like A Virgin!  <br /> <br />The remainder of the album careers along at a leisurley pace. Outstanding is another mesmerising and hauntingly atmospheric tune, Frozen which Madonna delivers compellingly whilst The Power Of Goodbye is breathtakingly beautiful, delivered with a sensual and soothing performance from this unbeatable pop diva. The profound religious and spiritual undertones on the fantastic, Shanti, conveys Madonnas undoubted diversity as an artist. Only let down is the slightly forgetable Little Star, but apart from that, Ray Of Light emerges as her best album yet and was one of the most important albums of the 1990's. A masterpiece! <br />
0393072231|5|Now I'm better informed as to what happened to us in the financial melt down of the last two years.  Doesn't make me any less angry, but I'm a lot better informed.
B00EMXBDMA|4|As a space travel enthusiast and an engineer, I found the book exciting and the ingenuity reasonably plausible.  I turned it over to my teenage son to read so that he could appreciate the thinking on your feet and the infinite possibilities that can be realized if one is forced to think out of the box.  Travel to Mars is something right down the road for society.  I would recommend it as a must read for aspiring engineering students.
B00E8AVNAE|5|I really enjoyed this movie but I have always liked westerns and I love Danny Trejo. He's in so many movies but usually only for a minute or two, this one he is in  all the way.
B0002XVQNU|4|I didn't care too much for Colin Farrell's obnoxious one-dimensional character, Bullseye, nor Michael Duncan Clark's unconvincingly cruel Kingpin.  The script short changes the dialogue for the villians but more than makes up for the intimate interactions between Ben Affleck's and Jennifer Garner's characters.  This is the movie's saving grace.  Affleck plays a convincingly somber Daredevil who serves justice to the common man by taking the lives of the guilty.  Despite his physical blindness, his other senses have become extremely amplified and gives him the perceptive powers to fight crime.  He lives his life through revenge and violence.  His alter ego is a lawyer who defends only innocent people or people he knows to be innocent.  This biased character flaw is was makes his dark nature so convincing and deeply touching.  What he cannot see, he feels very strongly.   <br /> <br />Besides his late father, there is a strong love for Elektra, the lovely socialite aptly played by Jennifer Garner.  And definitely not to be outdone by her secret superhero lover, Elektra seems to hold her own as a martial arts expert (gotta give tribute to the Alias complex).   <br /> <br />So what is it about Affleck's somber nature and Elektra's survivalist instincts that brings this pair together and make them feel strongly for one another?  A chance for hope, maybe? Whatever it is, the chemistry works well between them and very convincingly, with or without the superpowers. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by the trailers.  There is less action going on in the story than appears, but this is still worth a watch. I give a C for the action, but A for the romantic intimacy.
0812550706|4|Someone at school told me to read this book. I don't know why I never heard of it before because its been around awhile but I loved it. Ender was awesome. I liked how he outsmarted the other kids and I loved the way his sister and brother created secret identites. I'll defintiely tell my friends.
B001GQ2TGA|5|I just got Enya's latest cd. I love it. My 15 year old son and I listened to it repeatedly on a long trip to the doctor.  I read a review which someone else made, and the comment was expressed that Enya needs to get some new instruments! That is like telling Kenny G that he needs to throw away his saxaphone for another instrument!!! Enya is a uniquely different musician, and her background music speaks ENYA!!! The songs are beautiful, some are fun. My son and I both loved this album!
B00KIAMIFW|1|Pretty weak. No substance. Nothing you can really sink your teeth into
B005ZOBNOI|4|Love stories can either end in death or estrangement. .I have read many a tale of love ending in a tragic death. I thought I will close the book as soon as I get a gist of the plot. After all , what new will this love story have?  So what kept me going till the last page were the characters Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. They have cancer and they are teen kids. But they have super cool personalities. Indeed they have this mature attitude towards life that it is hard to believe they are so young. But imminent death could do a lot to people. When you do not have ample time, you try to focus on the big picture. Hazel and Gus are in love inspite of the futility of their relationship. They think it is worthy. To quote from the book , some infinities are larger than others. A short time spent with someone special might feel like forever and infinite. I read some reviews that people cried a lot. I cried a little at the end but that's it. What I felt was sadness and wanted to get over the book as soon as possible. I did not want to be haunted. As long as the characters were with me , I neither loved them or despised them. I was just a silent observer. But as soon as I closed the book, I felt  a terrible loss. Though I wanted to move on to another book so that I can stop the haunting , I still cannot let go of the book until I went through all my notes and marks. I reread sections of the book and fell in love again and again.<br />&#34;I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly at first and then all at once&#34;<br /><br />A beautiful book in retrospection!
B00MU9R5OI|3|Its just an okay game.  Nothing exciting.
0553386794|5|An amazingly readable epic fantasy novel. Excellent political intrigue in a medieval world. A worthwhile read for anyone that loves the Lord of the Rings or any fan of the fantasy novel genre.<br /><br />It took a little while to break into the story -- lots of names and families to learn -- but once I did, I was hooked. I went through the last 200 pages like a glutton, reading faster and faster to learn what would happen.
B000A2RRF4|5|This DVD is the most awesome concert ever!!!!  I am so sad I did not fight the crowds when Michael was with us to go to his concerts.  Last time I saw him was 1970 in Frankfurt Germany, I was 11.  This DVD is crisp and extermely clear, the sound and picture quality is superb to say the least. He hit all the major songs flawlessly & I am awestruck all over again.  I will miss Michael, but I can now see him anytime with this DVD!!! What a musical genuis and talent!  I am excitely awaiting Michael's DVD concert in Japan, ordered also from Amazon (which is a great site).     Buy this DVD and you will fall in love all over again!!!!!  Oh yeah, there is a surprise ending that is pretty freakin awesome too!!!!!!

B00004U2GH|4|After seeing the movie \\"Walk the Line\\" I thought it would be nice to get a couple of Johnny Cash's albums.  I read that the \\"At San Quentin\\" and the \\"At Folsom Prison\\" were great albums.  They are both very good.  If I had to do it again and I only wanted to buy one album, I probably would have purchased a \\"greatest hits\\" type of album.

1401307450|5|\\"Scar Tissue\\" covers the life of Anthony Kiedis from birth to 2004.  It gives a first person look at the \\"Sex, drugs, and rock n' roll\\" lifestyle that was such a large part of Anthony's life for so many years.  Along the way you learn about the people, places, and things that inspired the music of the Peppers as well as a detailed picture of what life as a drug addict is like.  The book is written very well and it never seems like co-author Larry Sloman was part of the story.  You definitely need to read this book.
B0042U94UQ|4|A very cute cartoon movie, with unexpected twists and turns.  Well written.  A bit long in the last part, but still worth watching!  Beautifully drawn and animated!
B000007O9L|5|In the early 1990s virtually everybody from Eric Clapton to Nirvana released an Unplugged record. The Rolling Stones didn't. In several of the songs recorded for Stripped (1995), Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood play electric guitars. So all those who had some appetite for an unplugged Rolling Stones record were probably left a little unhappy. <BR>That said, Stripped is a really nice live record especially for their hard-core fans. Most of the live records that the Stones have released over time, from `Get yer ya-ya's out! (1970) onward (with the possible exception of Still Life, 1982), were centered around classic Rolling Stones hits such as Honky Tonk Women, Satisfaction, Sympathy for the Devil, Jumpin' Jack Flash and, more recently, Start me up. Stripped represents a step in a different direction as most of the songs recorded live for this album are the sometimes unjustly neglected Stones B-Side. The Stones recorded one song from their 1969 album. Interestingly what they played was Let it bleed instead of Gimme Shelter or You can't always get what you want. There are three songs from Sticky Fingers (1971), but two of the them (Dead Flowers and Love in Vain) are not neraly as well known as Brown Sugar. Two of the songs that appear on  Stripped were originally released in Exile on Main Street (1972). But even in this case, the Stones opted for Sweet Virginia and Shine a Light, instead of performing the superfamous Tumbling Dice or Happy.         <BR>But the overall quality of Stripped is great and record is nice treat not only for Stones fans. A final note is order, this is the second record with Darryl Jones on bass and it just shows how well he blended with the rest of the band not only in studio but also in live performances.
1595141715|2|I truly had high hopes for this book. Reading a bunch of reviews, not just on Amazon, but I did do my research prior to purchasing. I tend to not pay attention to bad reviews for anything and give whatever story I'm about to get into the benefit of the doubt. I'm one of those readers that like tearjerkers, so the synopsis of the book seemed promising. The use of audio tapes as the voice of Hannah Baker, with dual narration with clay was indeed creative. And the plot reminded me of \\"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\\" but instead, 13 Degrees of Hannah Baker.  The story did pull me in much like a thriller, and it took me only a day to read this. I admit, I couldn't put the book down. But it was only in hopes that the story would get even better. But to my demise it didn't. Teen suicide is such a sensitive and sad topic, especially after watching the HBO documentary \\"Boy Interrupted\\", and hearing about real teen suicides and their reasons.  The book started off good and intriguing, but some parts made Hannah Baker seem a little creepy. But I just kept reading to really find a justified reason to empathize with her suicide. But I couldn't find a \\"real\\" reason.  And the premise of it all seemed so trivial compared to what some of the other characters in this book went through and what she put them through.  She kind of just made me angry, her character was just far too sarcastic to even feel like she was depressed. The tone of Hannah Baker made it almost hard for me to feel sorry for her. Quite frankly she seemed like a jerk and bully almost. Or maybe its because I didn't translate her tone in my head very well. Either way I found it to be such a cowardly move for her to confront these people after she has already taken her life instead of recognizing what the actual problem was and addressing it to actually make a difference and possibly help other kids in crisis going through the same thing. So if you're looking for that kind of book this isn't it.  If it weren't for Clay's character, I would of rated this book a 1 star. Because he's the character I really connected with, the one I really felt bad for. But even that, to me he was the main character, and his portion of the tapes were only a few pages. Clearly he was fond of this girl, and his feelings for her started to unfold throughout the story, but it leads you nowhere.  The whole book was really about Hannah coming up with reasons and blaming it on other people, I mean, I understand, some of what she went through must of been painful, sexual harassment is serious. But at the same time some of her actions that lead to her suicide just made her seem selfish. It's like she wanted more of a valid reason to end her life, so she created one. But I guess you have to understand, this girls is a young teen, and I remember when I was that age anything could strike a series of depression, and raging hormones could cause extreme irrational behavior.  Its kind of hard say this but, If you're going to write a book on what lead to a fictional teen suicide, then the reasons should've been more deep to resonate with the reader. But I guess It's because Jay Asher never knew what it felt like to be a teenage girl. And if it was a book to make you realize how your actions affect other people, then that topic should of been more emphasized towards the end to give us a sense of what the \\"moral of the story\\" was.  Those reading this review please don't be discouraged to buy this book. Give it a chance, you never know you just might like it.

B000002I53|5|The album is awesome!  It's another classic that shows Coltrane and his ensemble at their best.  I was pleasantly surprised with the 4-song album that is definitely a jazz classic!  If you love Coltrane, you should love one of his best works!

6303014100|5|If your a Civil War buff like I am this movie is for you.  It vividly portrays the 3 day slaughter by actually putting you into the front lines with Col.

0307592839|5|Record-company executive Bennie Salazar wonders where the years went as he listens to another horrific band of young untalented egos that believe they belong at the top.  Divorced, he feels removed from his tweener son as if he still lives in analog and the kid is digital.  Bennie thinks back to the late 1970s in the Bay area when he was young and part of the punk band Flaming Dildos that thought they belonged at the top.<br /><br />Bennie's former assistant Sasha is a mother hiding out in the desert after a youthful life of impulsive thieving.  Her tweener daughter Alison thinks her mom is out of step with the digital world.<br /><br />Meanwhile Bennie meets Alex who dated Sasha.  He later hires him to obtain the services of fifty paid \\"parrots\\" to pretend to be fans of a group performing at a concert.  His target audience he informs Alexis is the silent future majority who text rather than speak.<br /><br />The key to the five decades of Bennie and others is what happens to a person when cynical age fueled by addictions and complacency overcomes youthful rebellious fervor.  Character driven with a powerful ensemble cast who all seem fully developed, the loci points anchor the epic story line are Bennie and Sasha.  Jennifer Egan is a virtuoso as readers will relish the changes of the information age as music is a terrific milieu as the industry travels from vinyl to cassettes to CDs to DVDs; mirroring society.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00DR0PDNE|5|I love Chromecast! It is very easy to setup and use. The one misconception is that it runs off the tv you do need to plug it into the wall
B00FRVH3V6|4|Definitely liked it, but not my favorite. The ending felt a little abrupt. Still, love the book and the series.
B006LSZECO|4|Very good book, it kept me in suspense the entire time waiting to see what would happen to the main characters! I was disappointed at the end, only because I wanted to read more about what happened with them later on in their lives.

B005FFW46S|4|Vimes in full flow with his family along for the ride. Welcome to the countryside where all is not well.<br /><br />Overall a thoroughly entertaining read.<br />One quibble is that occasionally the dialogue is a hit trite like it's trying too hard to be witty, but compensations are found in most cases.
B00008CLOA|5|This is still the best rock/opera style recording of all time, in my opinion, of course. The sounds are mystical, dreamy and creative. The mix of guitar, drum and special effect sounds are still mind altering. Thank you Pink Floyd for this all time classic.
B00H8AXO1W|1|This Movie is not worth the hour and a half of wasted time.<br />Should have watched another episode of Stargate Atlantis.
B00005JNEI|1|This thing was a total joke.It completely lacks objectivity.It's full of sound bytes which are removed from the context of whatever conversation was going on.A documentary as I understand it,DOCUMENTS facts and events within context to allow the watcher a complete understanding.[...]
B002BVOYBW|5|I love this movie. The characters are so real and they face struggles in a unique way. Theerw are lessons to be learned.
B00005LK94|4|A very nice movie overall. Thirteen year old Amy looses her mother, and has to live with her estranged dad who is well, strange- He spends his time flying ultralight airplanes and making odd sculptures and inventions. She copes by raising geese, who have also lost their mother (due to evil developers). The geese think Amy is her mother and follow her everywhere. The problem is that geese generally migrate south every winter, but there is no one to show Amy's geese the way- until Amy, her dad, and family hatch this brilliant scheme to show them the way south by leading them on an ultralight airplane.<br /><br />The movie works quite well until the actual migration. We get to see Amy's complex reaction to loosing her mother, and how raising the geese helps her adjust to her wacky father and family, and her new life.  But the movie changes tone and becomes rather silly and unrealistic during the flight scenes, pulling tricks of a Disney movie to get cheap thrills: they land on an air force base with no consequences, they suddenly find themselves flying in the middle of Baltimore city due to fog.  There are the one-dimensional villains (the evil developers), and the random, `family moments' which in this case are awkward, ill-placed conversations between father and daughter about loss and the importance of family.<br /><br />With all that said, the migration scenes are still very, very nice (but could have been truly spectacular without the silliness mentioned above) because the real stars are the geese themselves (who are extraordinarily charming and graceful) and the fantastic scenery.<br /><br />It is worth it to watch some of the additional material. But note, you will find that the REAL story is quite different from the story told in the movie.  The actual story is not about a young girl and her father bonding over geese, but a serious scientific venture to save endangered birds such as certain crane species.
B007J4T2G8|5|I love the story. It is one of the best romance book I ever read.<br /><br />I would recommend this book.
B004LOMB2Q|4|I use Evernote for grocery lists, to-do lists, to store random thoughts and ideas for future reference. I use it keep lists of writing ideas and projects, writing outlines and more. Since I can access it on my laptop, pc, phone and tablet it is always handy.<br /><br />I loaded Evernote on a phone years ago but never tried it. Big mistake. Having begun a few months ago to use the app I cannot imagine getting along without it now.
0375869026|4|A young adult novel that could be read by adults too.  Puts you under the main character's skin.
B000FBJG04|4|I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of World War II.  I was a very young person during that time, but remember some of the details and reports on the news.
B00IX9UTLU|5|Omg what a hot HOTT book! Just when I thought Colton was my book boyfriend along comes Hudson. Great book.
B00P5968FC|3|scary, but not as scary as it was hyped to be. solidly meh.
B0043RSK3K|5|Stone and Kuznick state right in the Introduction that our country has done much good in the world, but we already know about that. Their purpose is to document our less creditable actions, the stuff that our Fearless Leaders and their academic & journalistic sycophants don't want us to know.<br /><br />Much of the material in the book has already been covered by Chomsky and the late, great Howard Zinn. But Stone & Kuznick are better writers.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in what's been done to us, and to others in our name, this book will inform you.
B00FY84E9G|5|This is a classic film that everyone should see.<br /><br />Despite its age, the film holds up very well, and is compelling in spite of their failure to truly predict what the future might look like.<br /><br />I really wonder if the remake of this film will capture any of the same magic.<br /><br />&#34;I'd buy that for a dollar!&#34;
B00AGOGOLE|5|Great app. Love taking pics with this app. Easy TO use way better than others. No problem with video or any of the other complaints. Great app!

B004LWZW7O|5|JT is great in the movie In Time
0451169514|5|Stephen King's best book, without a doubt. The only one that comes close  is The Stand. The book develops a real history and becomes very believable  from the immaculate description. All the dialogue is realistic for the ages  of the characters and the time periods. Perfectly seams together flashbacks  with the modern lives of the main characters and never disappoints.
B00P7PJ9P0|5|Amazing, heart felt movie
B007V693YK|4|I haven't looked at all of the features, but so far, i love what i see.
B008MEM24S|5|This game is a puzzle that keeps going. It's soooooooo much fun.  I was sad when I finished where's my water, then so excited when it recommends this game. Both very entertaining and hours of fun because I can't stop.
B004DLPXAO|5|I really like the kindle for Android.  I like to be able to use it where ever I go -- thank you Amazon
B007SOQBCM|2|greatly disappointed in this app. I am a avid twitch user that has many channels followed but the amazon fire stick does not allow you to log in and view the followed channels. I can forgive the lack of chat but the as long as you can make a favorite section. Also the resolution seemed to be much lower than i expected but that is just a minor point
B008MEM24S|5|So much fun, even if you don't like the show. I had played Where's my water on my iPod touch and it's so much easier on a tablet.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is one of the best games I've ever played in my whole life. At first it looked bad but when I played it, it was a great game
1478230096|5|So I decided that THIS TIME- before going to watch Les Mis I am going to educate myself about the story.  Just finished it last night so am now ready to make the plunge.  Great book- super easy to understand and everything is crystal clear!
B00ARF92HK|4|I enjoyed the movie.  Not all &#34;hollywooded-out&#34; like the Stallone version was (and the way the previous Batman series got).  This was just a gritty, dirty, in-your-face action movie.  The story was there (not amazing but served the purpose), and the characters stayed true to form without necessarily being stereotypical.  Funny watching this-and then Star Trek: Into Darkness right after each other and seeing Urban in such different roles.<br />The violence was excessive-if you have a problem with that sort of thing (I do not).  But I think that it all fit within the story.  The place they were was a bad place and bad things happen there.  I'd definitely watch it again.
B00E9A656K|3|ok
B00L9B7IKE|2|Very depressing read.  There is not one likable or admirable character in this book.
B004LQGXPA|5|For me, Patton represents one of  the most important military leaders in the world.  He defended the inviolable truth of human rigths, not the false message of socialists and populist leaders  we have today across the board including many in the actual Administration of the United States and the POTUS 2008-2016.  USA love Winnners. not losers, like Patton said in his initial speech in this valuable movie, and so, USA must be the Guardian of freedom in all the world.

B00479SVBU|4|This is the second one these I've purchased.  The first one I had, the blue LED light went out after only a few months.  But it continued to play music for another year and a half until I pulled it out of the cigarette lighter 1 too many times by the front.  I drive for a living so I use this device 8 hrs a day up to 50 hrs a week.  It works well, it's easy to use, but make sure you turn it off when you turn your vehicle off, (hold down the middle button) to preserve the life of the LED light.  And always, always, remove from the cigarette lighter by pulling the back (tube) portion and NOT the screen portion of the device or it WILL fall apart on you.  Enjoy !!
B00632HWOG|5|This is the best email app client, especially if you are a yahoo user. One of the best applications to have for free overall. I recommend this to all
B004A8ZWVK|4|I'm from the south and this is a bit over-the-top as far as attitude, treatment, etc.  Some people were great that had different racial help, and it was a time when there weren't many jobs around - not too long after the GREAT Depression - don't take it too much to heart since it is a bit exaggerated.  Good movie, however.
B001AVCFJM|5|I really was not sure at first what to expect when I had first seen this movie but when it was over I was very impressed. I wasn't sure how it would be without the original cast playing their rolls but showing them as they are maturing in to the USS ENTERPRISE's crew and where they come from and their back stories I was quite surprised. I really enjoyed every minute of the movie and can't wait to see the sequel. AAA+++
B00CF34B2I|4|I absolutely love this game! I play paper Magic, and whenever I don't have  a friend to play against, I can play this! Everything about the game is amazing. The graphics, the gameplay, even how smooth it runs are all major pros on M14. Definitely worth the 10$ in my opinion. There is only one con. It is why I did not rate this 5 stars. It takes up 3 GIGABYTES of storage! So, if you have room for it on your tablet, download it. If not, you can be sure that you are not alone.

0316017922|3|I read this book in less than 2 days. It was an easy and enjoyable read. But there were several problems that kept me from giving it four or five stars.<br /><br />The author's point is that innate talent or genetics are not sufficient to explain successful outliers, whether in music, sports, business, etcetera. He states that there are other factors, some of which we might designate as \\"luck\\", that are often downplayed but are critical for high-level achievement or success. There's nothing new or revolutionary about his thesis. In fact, I would even state that it is obvious, although he provides some very interesting and entertaining examples to make his point.<br /><br />However, his research was almost all from secondary or tertiary sources. He rarely considers opposing points of view and significantly downplays innate ability (perhaps to help sell his book and comfort the average reader that he/she is not completely to blame for his/her underachievement). He also reaches conclusions that are based on conjecture, rather than compelling, independent research. For example, he states that Asians excel in math because math makes more sense in the Asian languages than in Western dialects, and their rice paddy culture instilled a strong work ethic that was not conveyed in traditional Western feudal societies. While this is interesting and may have an element of truth to it, there are some problems with this view. First, why do 3rd and 4th generation Asian Americans excel in math despite an inability to read, write, or speak in their original Asian language? If hard work is the answer (i.e. innate ability is not the reason), then why has research shown that Caucasians do better than Asians on verbal tests, whether tested in the native Asian tongue or in English? Does hard work only pay-off for math? He also cites a psychologist that claims Asians have a higher IQ than Caucasians, but then he cites another psychologist, J Flynn, who says that the Asian IQ has been historically lower than Caucasians. He seems to cite Flynn to bolster his position that intelligence is not the reason why Asians are excelling in academics, yet he never considers the possibility that perhaps the IQ testing method and questions may be flawed, which is why there are conflicting results from two prominent researchers.<br /><br />Gladwell also mentions Ericsson's work showing that it takes 10,000 hrs of deliberate practice to achieve high-level success or become an expert in a given field. But he inadequately defines deliberate practice. It does not mean practice, in the generic sense. Ericsson had a very specific meaning when he used that term in his work.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this book is entertaining and an easy, enjoyable read. However, it should not be read as a well-researched text or reference. It is a great introduction into the field of expertise and success research, but nothing more. For this reason, I've given the book 3-stars.ically lower than Caucasians.

B00004SCX6|1|Oh good gracious me, where should I start?  This &quot;music&quot; is downright awful!  Bubblegum pop trash with not an ounce of talent whatsoever!  Britney can't sing to save her soul.  And don't get me started on her version of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction!  My advice:  Don't buy this ridiculous bubblegum pop trash!  Buy some REAL music like Styx, Journey, REO Speedwagon, etc.  THOSE bands are capable of putting out REAL music.  They write their own songs and play their own instruments.

B00G4Q3NDA|5|There’s a moment towards the end of 12 Years a Slave where Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) looks directly into the camera and seemingly at the audience.  He stares for an extended moment, as if to say, “Can you believe that only 150 years ago – this happened…in the United States of America?”  12 Years a Slave is the quintessential American slavery-era film; it is heartbreaking, disturbing, tender, raw, and also beautiful.<br /><br />Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northrup, a free, New York citizen who is a victim of a horrific kidnapping scheme where Southern slave traders abduct free Black citizens and transport them South forcing them back into slavery.  Northup’s life and family are ripped from him so suddenly that it is astonishing.  The title is pragmatically evocative of how long Northrup will endure his injustice, and director Steve McQueen makes sure the audience feels every bit of it as well.<br /><br />The film is based on Northrup’s own memoir, a literary example preciously rare as so many slaves died before they could tell their stories or were never taught to read and write.  A pervasive struggle Northrup faces in the film is searching for tools or opportunities to write.  The film opens with Northrup covertly trying to make ink out of blackberry juice and fashion a pen out of stray twigs.  McQueen wisely emphasizes the oppressive silencing that occurred in order to, in some way, try to explain how such outrageousness was even possible for so long.<br /><br />McQueen frames Northrup’s experience by casting recognizable faces as various archetypes of 19th Century Southern society.  Paul Giamatti plays a slave merchant in all of its absurdity, Benedict Cumberbatch plays the hypocritical plantation owner who seemingly appreciates humanity but wants to turn his eyes from the horror he knows is happening right under his nose, and Brad Pitt plays…Jesus; I’m pretty sure he’s playing Jesus.  However, one player, other than Ejiofor, gets to sink his teeth into a role that is far more substantial, Michael Fassbender.  Fassbender plays Edwin Epps, a slave owner who owns Northrup for nearly 10 of his 12 years in slavery.  Fassbender is terrifying; his character is reminiscent of Ralph Fiennes’ character in Schindler’s List, yes – he’s that chilling.  However, what sets him apart from being a typical embodiment of evil is that as the film goes on, it is clear that Epps is mentally ill.  This element does not garner sympathy for his actions, but it does reveal some of the helplessness inherent in a society that avoids the value of human life.  The end result is a decaying infrastructure that eats away at itself until it collapses.<br /><br />Of course, this is a showcase for Chiwetel Ejiofor, an actor who has been on the brink of greatness for some time now.  Ejiofor’s performance is certainly in the running for the best of the year.  He harnesses strength as he portrays the effects of a dark and obtuse time in human history.  As Solomon Northrup, he leads the audience through a series of events that certainly require a bold and fearless guide.<br /><br />12 Years a Slave is a moody masterpiece that I’m sure offers more context in repeat viewings, but I don’t know what kind of person would be able to sit through this film more than once.  McQueen contrasts the most abhorrent events of our young country’s history with some beautiful filmmaking, glorifying the Southern landscapes in rich, luscious irony.  His camera is up close and personal, using countless close-ups with the clear objective of putting slavery “in your face.”  The emotion is real and raw, not melodramatic.  Towards the end of the film, Northrup finally breaks down, which is inevitable.  He weeps for what he has missed.  It is a history lesson of the best and worst kind.

0689829590|5|I can't say anything negative about this book.  We purchased it for my husband to read to our grandson.  The story is sweet and as always, the illustrations are phenomenal.  An added touch is the pages that expand to show the highlights of the story.  This is great for young ones who just like to look at pictures or those who love to be read to.  Another excellent story.
B00DUGCLY4|4|Seems too easy at first... but then you get a puzzle that makes you stop and think! Fun overall! Hints help a lot!
B000E41MS6|4|I purchased this DVD set as a gift for my husband who has been a fan of Doctor Who since its beginnings. We have watched all the seasons of David Tennant as Doctor Who. My daughter has even become a great fan and plans her social calendar around new episodes. We will miss David Tennant as Doctor Who but look forward to the new Doctor and new adventures.  The Complete First Series is very good to watch and see how it all begins.  I highly recommend the series and will be purchasing more seasons in the future.
067164159X|5|ISBN 067164159X - Ironically, I picked this one up right after I finished Ludlum's The Gemini Contenders, and they have a lot in common - a secret hidden during WWII comes to light and becomes the responsibility of a later generation and the chase is on. I gave Ludlum 4 stars and give this one 5 for two reasons; Archer's book is an easier read and the hero of his book is around long enough to care about.<br /><br />Thought to be a traitor, Gerald Scott resigned his commission from the army. When he died, he had little to leave his family, other than the taint of that resignation and an unopened letter from a Nazi war criminal. Adam, his son, inherits the letter and takes a simple one day trip to Switzerland to retrieve the contents of a bank box the letter refers to. From that moment on, Adam's life is anything but simple. Chased by the Americans, the Russians, the Swiss and the British, and unaware of the secret he's got in his possession, Adam has to get to safety. First, he has to solve the mystery of his inheritance, figure out where safety is and who he can trust, and manage to stay alive doing it all.<br /><br />The secret itself seems a tad silly, but other than that, the story is fast-paced and very easy to follow, putting it a little bit above some overly convoluted thrillers I've read.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks
B000053VAZ|5|Love the movie. I love Jonny Depp. I am glad that it was a very creative movie that even I tried making grilled cheese with a iron. It was fun but not something to truely try. But fun to try I really would say it is worth the money to buy you will not be disappointed.
B00BH0VSM6|5|Very twisty plot. I was as confused as Harry Hole seemed until end of the book. What a story! So many characters in the story richly described by this author. I just wanted the book to go on and on!  One of the best books I have ever read. I'm sooo glad I waited until the 1st book in the Harry Hole series was published and sold in the US to start reading Jo Nesbo's series.  Now I look forward to reading the rest! Yeah!!
B000002GYG|4|This is a refreshing Tom Waits CD.  Tom tells a lot of jokes in this recording and the audience responds well! A lot of good beatnik-style, talking-type songs on here as well!
0545615402|5|Nice little set of three books.  Very easy to read and it doesn't add too much more to the stories, but even seeing familiar names/places/magical words in a book brings a smile to a Harry Potter fan's face.  They look and feel great too.
B00IOVH8AW|5|This a great song and I really love how it just makes you feel so happy about life this is the jam!

When I finished Best Kept Secret, I know and expressed to my husband that I wanted to read the next book NOW.  This was one of the best endings to a book and I'm looking forward to the next.  The next book can't come soon enough for me.
031603438X|5|Keith Richards should have been dead many times over, yet somehow he survives while the young punks who would claim his throne as the drugged-out Guitar God of Rock fall by the wayside. How come? Well, according to Keef, he gets only the best drugs. Also, he's a very hard worker.<br /><br />\\"Life\\" is by no means perfect, but it doesn't have to be; it's refreshinly honest, something that you would hope from other luminaries of rock music's past and present but really don't expect when publicists and agencies often control what a celebrity says. Richards has laid bare the past almost seventy years of his life to show us the lonely kid who grew up to be one half of the Other Great Songwriting Duo of the Sixties (behind those guys from Liverpool that you may have heard of), as well as a genuine survivor of all the excesses that his particular lifestyle and profession can offer. He's candid about his drugs abuse, his attempts to maintain a relationship and a family while constantly being on the road, and his near-death experiences and the friends he lost along the way (Gram Parsons perhaps being the most famous of the \\"Friends of Keith\\" now pushing up the daisies). Through it all, he writes in a rambling fashion that grows on you.<br /><br />The story of the Stones is here, of course; Mick and Keith's first meeting, first songwriting session (in manager Andrew Loog Oldham's kitchen), and the first rush of success, followed by the conquest of America, the death of Brian Jones, the horror of Altamont, and the excess surrounding \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" If you're looking for a blow-by-blow account of the Stones' career, sorry. This is Keith's story, and the Stones play the biggest role (especially the on-again, off-again partnership with Glimmer Twin Mick Jagger). But I found his descriptions of his childhood and his time as a solo artists in the late Eighties just as interesting as the stories behind \\"Satisfaction\\" and Altamont. The fact is, he's more than just the guitarist in the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, and \\"Life\\" fills out that portait.<br /><br />Like the best rock memoirs (John Densmore's \\"Riders on the Storm\\" and John Lydon's \\"Rotten\\"), \\"Life\\" isn't content to rest on the oft-repeated tales of debauchery, though those crop up. The real meat is the parts of the story you didn't know, and Keith is a great tour guide to some of the highs (and highs) of his life. The man speaks the truth, and he's damn entertaining at it. A hard skill to acquire, for sure, but Keef has it in spades.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and get \\"Life\\". Keith Richards did remember all of it, and thank goodness he did.Greatest Rock and Roll Band, and \\"Life\\" fills out that portait.    Like the best rock memoirs (John Densmore's \\"Riders on the Storm\\" and John Lydon's \\"Rotten\\"), \\"Life\\" isn't content to rest on the oft-repeated tales of debauchery, though those crop up.

B007FG9LIE|5|Mind blown!!! What a great story. So many twist and turns!! A must read. Loved every minute of it! Wow
145210655X|5|This is really clever and fun to read. The author, Jeffrey Brown, does a great job of taking common Star Wars tropes and making cute and entertaining jokes, and situation out of them.
B00SBNVLWY|5|Absolutely amazing as all of them are!! Red Phoenix is one of the best authors I have ever come across!!!
B00005JKJA|5|The movie of our lifetime.
B00HXYKYIE|5|Jenna is determined to find out what happened to her mother, Dr Alice Metcalf, a researcher of elephant behavior. Is she alive or dead after going missing 10 years ago?  The chapters are character themed as Jenna remembers her mother from age three and seeks help to find her or learn the truth. Alice's chapters which deal with her research on cognitive and behavioral facts about elephants are amazingly interesting.  Ms. Picoult promises on her website that once you read Leaving Time, you’re never going to think about elephants quite the same way. This was certainly true for me.  The ending was so unpredictable.  Every page from 70% onward changes your thought on how this book will end. The conclusion is amazing!

630196697X|5|Shot in just ten days on the mean streets of NYC, this Samuel Fuller film epitomizes the essence of noir.  Grifters, detectives, and spies emerge as stark characters interwoven in a plot tainted with desperation, betrayal,  and loneliness.  Pick Up On South Street is the canvass that reveals urban  realism painted in its most blackest and whitest.  Every aspect of the  film-from the gritty on site location shooting to the effective use of  close up facial shots warrants uncompromising attention.  Manhattan's  apartments, streets, subways, and harbor are masterfully landscaped into a  montage of darkened shadows highlighted by light grays and luminious  whites. Richard  Widmark has never been better as Skip McCoy the two-bit  pickpocket whose multi-layered persona slowly unravels within this seventy  minute thriller. Jean Peters is equally convincing as the street tough who  conceals her vunerability with a tight dress and a loose mouth.  Thelma  Ritter steals every scene she appears in as the aging grifter who has the  dope on every hood worthy of a police record.  At the time of the film's  release (1953) American loyalty and patriotism in society was being tested  by the fervor caused by McCarthyism. A shift from the threat of gangsterism  to Communism had engulfed the American psyche.  The FBI had proclaimed that  the most notorious gangsters from John Dillinger to Al Capone no longer  roamed the country.  Instead an even more menacing evil was threatening the  sanctity and integrity of American morality and only a vigiliant public- be  it cops or crimminals could combat this covert force. In the wake of the  McCarthy hysteria, a pickpocket was frowned upon,a Red was condemned to  purgatory.  No film captured the triangle of forces- crime, Communism, and  American justice as deftly as Pick Up On South Street.  For all fans of  noir classics, this is one to own and enjoy.
B00FAX6XQC|3|like the game. thought it likes to freez frequently and am unable to purchase in game items. rather wish the developers could fix the problem with it freezing
B0049J3QF4|5|Little guy loves it.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Excellent novel. World War II from the point of view of blind French girl and a lonely teen age German soldier. Their lives cross in St Malo in Brittany in 1944. There are bad guys or good guys only the tragedy of war.
B00E8KLWB4|5|it is a great game. pretty cool on kindle. passes time quickly. a must have APP! I likf it a lot
B005J9ZFQG|5|Perfect condition! This was my favorite one growing up and it was the hardest for me to find.  I normally don't like to have to resort to online to buy my movies but...I'm very happy with this purchase.
0140620303|4|I am on a quest to read classic literature. Frankenstein wasn't at the top of my list, or even near the top probably, but my best friend continued to encourage me to read it as it is one of her very favorite books.<br /><br />Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus (Penguin Classics)<br /><br />This classic book has inspired no fewer than fifty films. It definitely has a firm place in classic literature and in culture. I had no idea that Mary Shelley was the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. They married when she was age 18/19 years old, in 1816. It was upon a dare, by Lord Byron, to write a ghost story, that Mary Shelley wrote the novel. I like that she didnt just write a \\"ghost story\\" and developed a plot-line like no other before.<br /><br />The review I am in the midst of writing, here, is going to be a mixed bag. I must say that I was quite surprised that the story was written in such a way that it was not difficult for me to finish; not a drudgery as I read it. I somehow felt compelled to read it. I suppose I would say that her writing style is very agreeable. The story is written in the form of a person retelling the story he has been told, in letter form, to a far-off loved one. Writing a story in this manner required an additional back-story. Shelley gave this story the same attention to depth as she gave the main one. I like that; so many of today's authors just do not write in this manner.<br /><br />Overall, however, I do have issues with the story. The premise of the story is that Dr. Victor Frankenstein is on a quest to create life. I think that in order to indulge the story one must suspend reality and choose to believe that man can create life, even in the late 1700s. Done. I do, however take great issue with the fact that in the story Dr. Frankenstein has finally succeeded in creating life when, all of a sudden, he looks at the creature he has created and, aghast, decides he has created something too hideous to allow it to be. Does he destroy it though? Nope; that would end the story. He allows it to remain \\"alive\\" and falls asleep. This of course, comes back to haunt him. The monster leaves, unhindered.<br /><br />Frankenstein learns language and the ability to read through watching a small family without their knowledge. I enjoyed this part of the story. He views them with great longing. His only wish is for communion. Human communtion? Why, he isn't human. But at the very least, human communion would provide him with some form of relationship, his deepest desire. Even his own creator chose not to commune with him. One of the characters from this portion of the book is blind and that gives the \\"monster\\" an opprotunity to speak with him, hoping that he can gain favor with him and then with the rest of his family. This character quickly recognizes the \\"monster's\\" true circumstances and it is summed up well in his words here:<br /><br />\\"Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.\\" Pg 91<br /><br />The next part of the story with which I take issue is that Frankenstein sets off on a long trek and somehow ends up in Geneva and on the property of the Frankensteins without any stated assistance in finding it. That's a bit neat, isn't it? Pretty unbelieavable; there again, it allows for the progression of the story.<br /><br />When the \\"monster\\" finally has an opportunity to speak with Frankenstein he says this:<br /><br />\\"God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image' but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am slitary and abhorred.\\" Pg 88<br /><br />He pleads with Frankenstein to create a female for him, one as equally hideous as he, as a mate with whom he can share love and life. He wants only to be accepted and have a person whom he can accept. Love...isn't that the desire of all people? And wasn't he created in the image of humanity? He offers that they will go live in the farthest reaches of the north where they will bother and be bothered by no one.<br /><br />\\"It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.\\" Ppg 98<br /><br />\\"Let me see that I excite the of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!\\" Pg 99<br /><br />Frankenstein's monster is so adamant of his need for a mate that he threatens to take vengeance upon Frankenstein if he does not concede to his request/demand. At once Frankenstein agrees that he will create a mate for him; the story progresses a bit, and, voila, Frankenstein rethinks his impulsive decision and determines he will not create another being. Queue the scary music. The monster vowed vengeance if a mate is not created for him; he followed him from Ingolstadt to Geneva; can engeance not be imagined by Frankenstein at this point?<br /><br />Vengeance...it arrives. There is death, and more death. Eventually, Frankenstein ends up chasing the monster to far reaches of the north. Did I say \\"vengeance\\". It doesn't take a lot to figure out what happens next does it?<br /><br />It's easy for me to pick away at the threads of a story. I am not a writer, am I? And so, I feel it would be unfair for me to do so without also finding praise where it is worthy. As I said, the story was compellingly written. I did not avoid or put off reading it once I began. I am glad I read it.<br /><br />And the premise...the creation of life by man. What a premise! It is one that only has greater implications today; perhaps moreso than Shelley could have ever even imagined. She wrote this stunningly well for it to have been written in the early 1800s.<br /><br />What if man could create life? Just because one can do something it does not mean it is something that should be done. Truly, I only believe that God can create life, eternal life, life with a soul. Science has been used by man, to do many things that have direct connections to life. Transplants are just one of those things; there is also research in the lab, on the cellular level. Scary stuff. Yes, the result of some of these things can be great good; it can also be great devastation, as this novel, in great foresight, warns.<br /><br />My husband and I had an interesting conversation with regard to all of this. Frankenstein initially was only sorry he created the \\"monster\\" because of its hideousness. Really? Isn't that fantastic?! He was sorry he created something so ugly! That begs the question that my husband raised: \\"If you could create aesthetically pleasing, beautiful life, would it then be okay to do so?\\" I hardly think so. And that is wherein lies much of the inherent beauty of this novel; it causes great thought.<br /><br />Some of my favorite lines from the book are:<br /><br />\\"A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a tranistory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not be enslaed, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\\" Pg 32<br /><br />\\"Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.\\" Pg 133<br /><br />It's only been days since I finished reading the novel. While it was still very fresh in my mind I wished to watch a well acclaimed movie version of it. I watched 1994's release \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" starring: Robert DeNiro, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hulce, Helena Bonham Carter. A bit of artistic license was taken with the story but not so much that the essence of the story was changed. In fact, I feel that it played out quite well. I was afriad it would be way too gory for me. It had its moments but I think it was handled well given the subject and necessity of including a certain amount of gore. The cultural significance of Frankenstein does not end with the questions it brings up.

0062060554|4|I would add this book to be one of my favorites. I do not understand all the negative reviews.  I thought the book held ones interest throughout the entire story.  I found myself trying to guess what the outcome would be only to be somewhat surprised at each turn of events. I can't imagine waking every day not knowing who I am. This was a unique concept and I truly enjoyed reading how she coped.
B0012GMZMW|5|While this album didn't feature Steve Perry on vocals, I had heard the track &#34;Remember Me&#34; from the Armageddon movie soundtrack and really liked it. Shame that track wasn't included on this release as it would have been near perfect. New singer did a great job, the songs are consistently good, and there's a few new classics here. Have listened to it continuously. Way better than Trial By Fire.
B00U7VDC7A|5|It's a great game but some places are hard to touch maybe if I had a bigger screen it would help
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game but I wish there could be more energy's and treats
0882709194|1|This 150th anniversary version with Ray Comfort's 50+ foreword is a disgrace to science.<br /><br />Comfort has a clear Christian Creationist agenda. He knows NOTHING about Evolution, yet writes as if he has actual knowledge on the matter. His assertions are laughable.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor (since Amazon isn't being helpful yet), and search for the REAL 150th anniversary edition on here, or at your local book store.
B0090KZDSK|3|I decided to still give it a read as I'm invested in the story by now and wanting to know what happens. Yes, parts dragged on but I still enjoyed the story and the emotion in it. I would rather have read it than not!
B00DF0ZP8Y|5|nice
B0000TB03W|5|This dvd instantly became my favorite and i'm sure you'll feel the same way. The sound and the look of the video are fabulous. Shania looks so incrediblely happy. If you saw the tv special you'll find by watching the dvd 6 extra songs.No way will any fan be disappointed by adding this to your collection. If you went to the chicago concert you just might see yourself as there are plenty of fans shots.
B009UX2YAC|5|Its fun to be chased by police while trying to collect items the game also gets faster as you get further along
B00FATEJYE|5|great game but make it easier to get money and the characters cost a little too much, if they fix that this will become one of the best games
B00270WH3Y|5|i have always loved simon and garfunkle. i listen to this at work and i can actually move to the songs from my past.
B00W3V83QW|4|Can't put it down.
B0069JBKHI|5|This is the best of its category by far after looking extensively on the web. image quality is excellent,installation easy. to be able to bring it to friends withtou having to take the charger (works on battery for 2hours) is great.
B0047WJ12K|3|This movie has potential but it is too confusing!  Too many flashbacks to previous scenes, too many story lines going at once.  Ending leaves you feeling disappointed.
B008SAZHLQ|5|An excellent read!
B00B2V66VS|5|It a very good apps.only play now for thr first time. On my lg motion.grafffic and scenery .excellent.keep dying  didn't get the hang off it yet
B00CHVIAS4|4|Good movie. I actually found myself into the plot. Great animation and 3D affects. Get this one, it is worth it.
B00AOCVKC6|5|This is a great, fun movie. There's both action and comedy. I watched it years ago with one teenage boy and just watched it again with the last teenager of the family. It's about a teenage girl whose boyfriend stands her up for the night and is asked to babysit this little girl and her teenage brother who has his friend come spend the night. The girl's friend runs away to downtown Chicago but gets has second thoughts when she's stuck in a bus station with some crazy people. She asks the babysitter to come get her and that's where the fun begins. It was hilarious then and still is which means it's a good movie.
B00003W8NM|5|Every negative review I have seen of this film I have to ask myself what movie these people were watching.  Most critics seem to be completely numb to such things as subtlety, metaphor, sub-text, and content.  this film had  all of these in spades!  I thnk that a lot of people simply did not get the  meaning of this film.  It goes far deeper than the  &quot;fight-the-power&quot; plot line that one reviewer on Amazon  describes.  This film is worth a second, third, fourth, etc... ad infinitum  viewing.  Even paying close attention (I had some idea what to expect) I  probably missed stuff that will amaze me when I buy the video (which I will  do the day this thing comes out! ).  Ignore what the bad reviews say  because those people couldn't see past a couple fist-fights to see the  brutal beauty of what this film is.  This film (as well as the novel it is  based on) are like Hemingway on steroids, but with more intelligence.
B00CNQ7HAU|2|Passable story but pretty easy to guess.
B00HXYKYIE|5|I didn't see THAT coming! Great book that spans numerous genres. I loved the facts I learned about elephants but I loved the story more. The ending will blow your Sox off.
B00FAX6XQC|5|This game takes u to every place u can hunt and kill all sorts of animals. It will take away it boredom and make u all up to play it unlike Farmville on Facebook. Lol
B009KS4XRO|4|The  bingo is fun. Fast but so far easy to follow
B009DCOU9S|1|After 2 hours of trying to get the last stupid ball to stick to a scroll, one level before the end, I give up. You win. Making the game impossible to finish qualifies, sure...<br />If you ever fix it,  I'll reassess the game and go from there. Until then, this game pretty much blows.
B008KOTNVA|5|This is a great tool set to have to fix electronic items
B005LAIII0|5|Excellent movie at a good price!
B008220AVW|5|Amazing movie
B00DVKOYBM|1|I liked it a lot until it randomly started crashing everytime I opened it! cant even play it now! but it was a good game before that.
B005XQLBU4|5|this game is awesome and I luv it I got to Lvl 23 and got the high score so thank you creators of this game
B0036G8IQS|5|The lightning thief is a great book<br />It has adventure, tragedy, a little bit of romance<br />And that's what makes it a really good book
B00EOARZ4G|3|Debt of Honor and Executive Orders were far superior to Command Authority. Maybe it was that sequals usually never live up to expectations. In this case this was a threequal. Debt of Honor laid the ground work for Jack Ryan to become president. Oh, if we only had him for prez now.Evecutive Orders showed what he was truly made of. Command Authority was kind of a recap of life for the last 25 years or so. It was O.K. to bring his son on board but Jack Jr. would never measure up to Pop. Maybe this was the last one before Tom's demise. Maybe he knew it would be the last and he was just out of ideas. Maybe his co-author was not quite up to par.  Who knows? But Tom Clancy will always be one of the outstanding authors of our time. Attention movie makers. Debt and Exec. Orders are made for mini-series.
B00DJFIMW6|5|The game is exciting and funny at the same time with the bombs and rockets ,slides and minion links awesome game.
B008K8VDPU|5|It's an awesome game plus it's educational. It teaches you how to use a piano.so it is basically giving you a piano lesson. There's just one thing.I keep having to erase the game and redownload it
B0002TJGQS|5|:)
B009ZFPQOQ|5|great app
B0055SWM08|1|I did not care for this game. I did not keep it for very long. I guess I did not like the game play or subject matter.
B00HV8T1WC|4|It was really good. It was amazing that Robert Redford was the only one in this movie plus he only spoke maybe 20 words in the whole movie but yet I was riveted to the screen only he could do that
B005TBN3EU|5|Love these movies.  Every one gets more and more exciting.  Not to mention funnier as they come.  Can't wait to see the third one.
B008JFLWLE|5|I love this app! By far my favorite calculator app because of its EASY navigation. My only recommendation for the producer would be to add an algebra option. Love everything else about the app though!
B000SUKPKM|5|Great tunes from a different musical era!  I miss hearing these songs on the radio, but now I have them readily available.
B00441GYZ6|5|I LOVE this movie! Woody Harrelson plays an awesome Larry Flynt. You might not agree with his way of making a living, however, the way he has fought to defend things like freedom of speech.<br />I watched this with my husband, who has never seen it before, and he was very into the story line. It has a great cast (Edward Norton, Courtney Love, etc.). Wouldn't recommend for family movie night though. It has sexual content and some nudity.
B0094BB4TW|1|some features don't work/aren't accessible.  you'd think otherwise, right?<br /><br />save yourself the frustration & just bookmark it.  don't bother getting this app!
B00005YW4H|5|Whenever I play this disk and close my eyes I see a dark jazz club with a piano, drumset, bass and guitar on stage.  The musical arrangements are clean and sparce, just the thing to set off her wonderfull voice.  The voice is soft and smooth, clear and a bit husky.  Listening to this disk takes me places I very much like to be.  What else can I say, I am just blown away by her voice and the music.  I am REALLY glad I bought this disk.
B00JFKEQBK|4|Cute addictive game - it can be really challenging, but it passes the time.
B00BD99JMW|3|Frustrating and unnecessarily sad ending to a great series. I'm glad I read it, but I rewrote the ending in my head and I like my version better.
B000002KBA|5|Certainly, one of the best Deep Purple CDs ever.  I never get tired of listening to Speed King - plus, this disc contains the original version of Child in Time - what a great ( really great ) song !!  Everyone in the band played superb on this recording.  Too bad it wasn't a double album.  Hard to believe it came out in 1970 - it could have been yesterday.
B001993Y3G|5|Being a Kevin Costner fan makes it easy to enjoy most of his movies. But the supporting cast in this one is excellent making the film fun to watch. Morgan Freeman is a great as always with his portrayal as a Moor. Alan Rickman is off the charts as the Sheriff of Notingham
B0043URV8M|2|I remember listening to the Half-Blood Prince before watching the film and being unimpressed at first. However, watching the film completely changed my opinion and resulted in some parts of the score becoming among my favourites in the entire series. I hoped that this could be the the case once more Deathly Hallows: Part 1, however I was mistaken. This score simply doesn't sound like a Harry Potter score to me. Although Hooper's scores tended to be somewhat minimalist at times, they always sounded like Harry Potter soundtracks to me. I was especially disappointed about the lack of Hedwig's Theme as Desplat had said that he believed it hadn't been featured sufficiently in the last few films. I know the theme does make a few very brief appearances, but unfortunately these are easy to miss and we are never given a true statement of the theme. Hedwig's theme appears to be the only homage to any of the previous scores and they are not even replaced - brief moments, e.g., in Snape To Malfoy Manor appear to be building up to something but ultimately left me unsatisfied. Although I can understand the fact that the films have been growing steadily darker as the story progresses, I don't believe that this a legitimate reason for the signature themes of the previous scores to be ignored. For example, Howard Shore did not decide to abandon the main themes in the Lord Of The Rings just because the characters' situation was growing darker. Even in the darkest moments, the Shire themes can be heard, albeit matured versions and although I can understand the fact that the music is going to subtler as much of the fanfare-style music of the earlier films would be out of place, I don't think that it should reach the point of being unmemorable - I literally find it difficult to remember most of the tracks on the C.D., having listened to it multiple times. Overall, I don't believe that it is a terrible score, however, as I mentioned it just doesn't sound very \\"Potterish\\" and I have gotten the impression that some of the music could have been written for just about any run-of-the-mill soundtrack. It just doesn't send the same chill down my spine as the previous scores did. While Hooper and Doyle might not have made much use of the majority of John Williams signature themes, the music always felt like it belonged to the films. I almost think that some of James Hannigan's scores for the video games were superior to this. I will certainly still listen to this soundtrack, but is such a pity that the first part of the end of the series had to be so low-key and underwhelming.

B001OGNOES|4|For the most part there are two types of Metal fans, those that like Testament and those who haven't heard much Testament. Obviously there are a few exceptions, but it illustrates a point, Testament are the kind of band to make loyal fans out of the vast majority of people who listen to them. Should you be reading this and wondering whether or not to try out Testament, I would strongly recommend that you do as you will almost certainly become a life long fan.<br /><br />Its pretty difficult to argue with The New Order really, any album that contains `Into The Pit,\\"Disciples of the Watch,' and `The Preacher,' is pretty much guaranteed, to put a smile on the face of any right minded metal fan, being as they are three of the absolute best Thrash Metal songs ever recorded. Should you be in any doubt as to whether or not to buy this album, then listen to any one of those songs, which will likely provide you with the all the convincing necessary.<br /><br />To be considered anything other than wonderful whilst containing the aforementioned tracks, the album would have to be pretty damn poor for the rest of the run-time and thankfully The New Order is anything but poor. The album opens with the effective `Eerie Inhabitants,' a straight up Thrash number with a clean beginning for added interest, contains a number of pummeling thrash classics, two relatively interesting instrumentals and a heavied-up Areosmith cover to prevent the album being too repetitive.<br /><br />Overall, the music is hard and direct Thrash Metal, with enough variety to escape tedium while still remaining true to the formula. The vocals as always are top quality and the level of musicianship is very high. There is a reason this album keeps turning up in lists of The Greatest Metal Albums Of All Time after all.<br /><br />If you have an interest in Thrash Metal then you really should check out Testament, and The New Order is a very good album to try.
B00NQKWAIQ|3|more singing and less instrumental
B00881VLCE|3|I really enjoy this app...especially the free daily puzzle. I hats that the app crashes at least one time per use. sometimes the crash comes when I'm exiting, so not such a big deal, but there have been several times the app has crashed in the middle of a puzzle and then it lost all of my work...extremely frustrating. Please fix the crashing problems... you would then have a 5 star app in my opinion.
B0000669JL|5|You have to own this fine selection of tunes, it's Marley at his best!!.I was so so happy with this purchase, and would reccomend this collection to Everyone!!
158270208X|3|I thought this would be a book to read. How ever being that it's for me to write in I'm satisfied with it.
B006LSZECO|5|Lots of twists and turns in the plot kept me reading through the fast moving novel. I loved it! Now to go back and read the earlier Flynn titles..
068987474X|5|While I recognise that it's flip and casual and fun, this book also gives great advice: it could be a revolution, if only women would stop beating themselves up over men who aren't worth one coat of lip gloss.  This book may sound harsh to some, but I truly appreciate it's straight-forward manner.  <br /> <br />My favorite was Chapter Nine: He's Just Not That Into You If He's Disappeared On You.  This chapter provides a fine roadmap away from guys suffering from SIDS (Sudden, Inexplicable Disappearing Syndrome.)   <br /> <br />Ladies, do yourself a favor: buy this book. Keep it nearby and re-read it ever time you're tempted to let some guy into your heart who isn't worthy to lick the soles of your shoes!!
B006LSZECO|5|Loved it! Exciting thriller.
0743298039|3|The Thirteenth Tale kept my attention throughout and I was actually surprised by the ending.   Though I thought the mystery closed up a little too quickly, I felt the characters were strong and I would recommend this book. I'm going to look for other books by this author.
B00F35B8F8|5|Awesomely classic !!! Well acted and perfect !!!
B00CKOYVG8|1|Not impressed
B005544TRQ|5|This show is so awesome!  I love all the actors. After I watch one episode, I couldn't wait to watch another episodes. I highly recommend this show. ...
B000001IQH|5|This is the first and only Rancid CD I have so far, and I love it.  Excellent singing, very unique voice.  I love the catchy tunes, the lyrics, it's an all-around good CD.
B00I3DNUR6|3|Murakami is always interesting. Here is another book in that same category. Compared with many other writers, Murakami is never predicable meaning there's always a surprise in store. Not his greatest book, but very good, and well worth reading.
0345451325|5|I read this as soon as I could get my hands upon it and let me tell you that it was not in the least a letdown. I loved the book from start to finish and now know a lot deeper into the story of Halo. The book starts out with Dr. who started the whole Spartan project looking for candidates into the program for the soldier that is seen in Halo. The story progresses focusing on the boy who would grow up into the Master Chief [I don't want to give anything away] But, as the covenant begins to close in the story escalates to a large battle between the human and covenant that ends where Halo begins. So this is a great book if you wish to delve deeper into the story behind Halo and why it is one of the most innovative storylines in the gaming industry as well as the best game for Xbox. Enjoy!
1781162646|4|Nice, old fashioned Stephen King, more slow paced, not such a long read, lovely.  I especially enjoyed the setting of the beach carnival life from yesteryear.
0316010669|2|I would prefer to read something written by a philosopher who cannot write than by a writer who cannot think.
B0097EWK3A|5|This is another great HO game, with the normal mystery behind it. Games are good, HO screens are excellent!  Very nice graphics. Thought this game was just nicer to play than some. Has a good story line and pretty constant games and HO screens without a huge amount of back and forth like some other similar games. Worth the 2.99 unlock price.
B00ESY7QXI|4|One of the more creative movies I've seen this year.  Jay Z helped produce this and there is a lot of his music on here.  Great flick.
B00AOCZOLO|5|Got this for my wife and she loves the series. Good characters and story lines. It's goofy but fun to watch.
B00F3VOL38|4|Fine, more previously unreleased stuff, all good.  The real issue is, why is this the only new Beatles release we are getting for this holiday season.  Specifically, where are the re-issues on vinyl of the original albums in mono?  It was bad enough that we didn't get them last year when the stereo ones were re-issued on vinyl, but I thought for use we'd then get the monos on vinyl this year.  I suggest all Beatles fans agree to boycott all Beatles related releases including this one and McCartney's new solo album until we get the following:  1)  The first 8 albums in mono, on vinyl, mastered in pure analog from the original tapes.  2)  The last three albums in stereo, on vinyl mastered in pure analog for the original tapes.  3) Forget this Past Masters and MMT album crap, we need a box with all the 7\\" singles and e.p.'s on vinyl.

B004SJ3BCI|5|My wife plays this game on her Kindle and really likes it.  She recommends it to anyone who plays computer games.
B005KDWUFA|5|Absolutely fantastic CD from four fantastic men!  All the songs on this are well worth the price paid for the CD.

B00BVYNSLC|5|Great show!
B00HV2KPNW|5|This was so good all my kids sat down and watched it even my one year old and my husband. That is saying a lot. My husband don't  usually watch cartoons with us.
B004HW7JMY|5|This arrived as expected.  It is great to have the complete season and watch it without worrying about missing an episode.
B000002J23|4|Three of the songs on this album- Machine Messiah, Does It Really Happen?, and Tempus Fugit, rank as some of the best songs Yes has made. That may not  sound like much, but it's one half of this short 6 song set.  The other  tracks range from passible to lame.<br />Sure, Jon Anderson is somewhat  missed, but Trevor Horn's vocals fill the job very nicely- in fact casual  listeners might swear it's Anderson singing anyway!<br />Technical  perfectionalists take note- the album is remastered, but there are  occasional moments of annoying distortion.  The ending of Machine Messiah  is practically ruined by what sounds like an overdriven mixing console.  I  don't know if this is from the original tapes or the fault is in the  remaster, but it's a shame.<br />However, it's an inexpensive album and those  three songs are WELL worth the purchase price.
B000JMKNJ2|5|The twists and turns were fun and exciting.  As a regular reader of fantasy, I thought this story was really unique. Locke is a great central character, I can't wait to read the rest.
B000FC1HBY|5|Awesome story. A whole new chapter in what has to be one of the greatest books series of all time!
0060873027|1|Boring, superficial, far from real Michael Crichton's techno-thrillers. Neither thriller nor techno. Maybe kids can enjoy. It is just a product for making money.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|It copied floppy bird it's addicting boring ans fun free<br />So far I just want all the colors of the bird
B001NLKT60|5|this book will keep you on your toes the entire way. These books are ment to keep you on your toes and keep you reading.
1476746583|5|I recently ordered ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE from Amazon and did, in fact, just finish reading it.  It was one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  The author takes you into the hearts and souls of those surviving through World War II in Europe (the Germans and the French&#34;) The two primary characters are beautifully written and the author weaves their stories throughout the book.  Also, I loved that the chapters were brief, none more than two or three pages.  It made the reading so much more fluid.  I found it hard to put down.  I totally recommend this book to those who love historical novels, or basically just great stories.  Anthony Doerr, the author, truly deserved winning the Pulitzer Prize for this book.
B002MQYOFW|5|Heard a lot about this book!! Really enjoyed it will get the rest of the series!!!! Hope the others are as good.
B001EC2ISA|5|What a classic
B003YL4LYI|3|[[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5)]]<br />I bought this book (kindle edition) because I read the previous 4 books and I wanted to find out how the story progresses. Given all the loose ends, I suspect the author will publish several more books before he will deem necessary to present us with the conclusion of this epic soap opera. Overall, I found this book less enjoyable than the previous ones. At times the pace of the narrative slows to a crawl and the author seems to take a questionable pleasure in his detailed glorification of total human degradation.  Some of the characters tend to become increasingly inconsistent (for example, Jamie Lannister seems to discover some latent sense of honor), the Ironmen appear increasingly like a time dislocated version of the Viking raiders and Braavos looks like a mixture of Venice and the ancient Greek port of Rhodes where the Colossus straddling its entrance has now become a gigantic statue named after deities of the Greek mythology (i.e. the Titans).  I missed the part where Greek mythology was taught in the Free Cities but I keep wandering why the author went through the trouble of creating such imaginative new geography (obviously the planet this story takes place is not our good old Earth) but kept the same moon (which scientists tell us is an anomaly in our solar system).  However, I will not question the ability of the Wall to stand for thousands of years in the same place and not becoming a moving glacier, (especially when it goes up and down hills) because I know the answer: it is the embedded magic.  Finally I was disappointed with the change of the very likable and assertive character of Daenerys into a woman who thinks more with what she has between her legs than between her ears.
B006RXQ8RI|5|every time just to try to catch all the &#34;elements&#34;, the dialogue, the scene, the music, and nice to know it now could be streamed
B00LZXOI5E|1|I too dislike being asked every few puzzles to rate, so I caved and decided to rate it.
0553801473|3|first, wanna say i'm an old hat to the series. but i don't know where it's going or how it can resolve all the loose bits. the ending will make you want to give up on the series. i can't recommend this until we see how it resolves. GRRM wrote an excellent world, fun characters you're invested in and a big convoluted plot. before this book. series went off the rails at a feast for crows. i used to tell everyone who could read to read these books. but not since the last two.
B00BRUYQFC|4|Let save you some time slogging through long reviews.  Here are the tracks not to be missed:<br /><br />\\"Pusher Love Girl\\" - Fun r&b beat, a head-bopper for your car<br />\\"Suit & Tie\\" - Great track... but first single, so you've already heard and downloaded this one<br />\\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" - Perfection.  Smooth intro followed by an old school groovy ode to the girl around the way and jazzy outro. To the reviewer who thought this track was too long and wanted to cut it down-yes, its long, but that's not always a bad thing.  This is the kind of song you can put on your summer chill mix.<br />\\"Mirrors\\" - This is the other single from this album. Pretty good, but currently on heavy radio rotation and the pop edge is not my favorite<br /><br />Other songs are just okay, although there are some that feel like they can grow on you with time.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I think that the game is good because my 3 years old brother can play it wy can't you just do it.
B008Y6MKSW|5|This film is a classic!  It's as funny today as it was when it first came out - the comedic timing, writing and directing are perfect!
B00004Y6O7|5|This is a great album in and of itself but it's also an obvious milestone in the progress of the band.<br />Prior to this album, Van Halen had made a name for themselves as a young and firey band that would come off tour just to record their next album. They would go into the studio and pretty much nail the recordings in one take and six weeks later hit the road again. But with Fair Warning, they actually slowed down a bit to get the recordings as near to perfect as possible.<br />This album is probably the slickest, production-wise, of all of their albums. The atmosphere of &quot;let's party our a** off and record it too&quot; was forever gone, to be replaced with the quality that would finally get them on the radio.<br />Van Halen &quot;cleaned up&quot; very nicely. Hearing Eddie's guitar playing is like hearing it for the first time. His technique is finally defined on this album and everything about his playing that was eventually copied by every garage-band kid is upfront and center.<br />I think of this as a &quot;dark&quot; album, especially as the listening progresses from &quot;Mean Streets&quot; to &quot;Dirty Movies&quot;. &quot;Dirty Movies&quot; still grabs my attention during the choruses. Michael Anthony's bg vocals are based on minor notes and lends a very sinister quality to the song and it should. The song is called &quot;Dirty Movies&quot;.<br />Interesting historical-tidbit thing here. When the band was recording this album, the division between David Lee Roth (DLR) and Eddie was beginning. Evidently, DLR began to become buddy-buddy with Ted Templeman (producer) and was leveraging this relationship to succeed with his ideas. Frustrated, Eddie almost quit the band (imagine quitting your own band). Alex convinced him to hang in there and find a way to get his ideas into the mix. So alot of the solos and guitar fills on the songs were recorded by Eddie when he would go into the studio at 3:00 in the morning, long after the session was over and everyone was gone. When everyone returned for the next day, Eddie's ideas were committed to tape and it was hard to not use them. They were so good.<br />When you hear the solo to &quot;Push Comes To Shove&quot;, it's hard to imagine that someone wouldn't have wanted to include it in the song.<br />A great album in the growth and eventual demise of one of rock's greatest bands.
B003XF1XOQ|3|The first two of the trilogy were great, the third lost something. I finished it, but it was a chore at times.
B0050SYS5A|5|A friend recommended I buy the Zoom since our Kinect was in a fairly small room and we were having trouble getting it to read everyone playing and not bystanders.  The Zoom did the trick, it recognizes more people in a smaller area which makes the dance and exercise games so much easier to use.  Another big plus, it is so simple to install.  Also, if you move your Kinect to a large area it is quick and easy to remove the zoom.
B000002JB3|4|This album is one of Phil's best. It exibits all that is Phil Collins. I am especially pleased with the song &quot;Lorenzo&quot; The story behind that song is inspiring. Lorenzo is a man that is living with ALD (Adrenoleukodystrophy). Before him, every boy that had had this genetic disorder had died within two years of diagnosis, mostly before the age of ten. Lorenzo's parents invented an oil which stops the debilitation of the disease, but does not reverse that damage that is already done. These parents fought for their boy who is still alive today (He's 23). Michaela and Augosto (Lorenzo's parents) wrote the lyrics to this song for Lorenzo. It is truly inspiring and adds to this album.
B0090SI3GQ|5|Great product at a fantastic price with lightening fast shipping!!  Great seller!!<br /><br />Thanks!
B002EWD0I6|5|I have watched many a British series, but this is by far the best. I wasn't so sure the first few episodes, but by the fourth I was hooked! So much more uplifting than any of the other characters. And I've read a few negative comments about Thomas the postman and I must refute them. I think he is played splendidly. And I've actually known people like him so I don't think it was ridiculous writing at all! In fact, all of the characters are believable and well developed. It's a joy to watch.
B00NJT3A5Q|5|Love Penatonix!  And their rendition of these Christmas songs is really amazing!  I have always loved Mary Did You Know...and I believe this is absolutely the *best* version I have ever heard.  Their voices are, individually, outstanding...and they blend them amazingly well.  As I listen to the songs, it's just so hard to believe it is all done a cappella.... as they add in the beatbox sounds to top off the amazing vocals.. It's such a joy to listen to them...
B004RJMUJO|5|I played the free game but I love the paid game even though you only get like three or four more blades.
B00TEJB8JK|4|Took a few weeks, but this has really grown on me.
B0054JZC6E|3|the games are pretty. basic, but it kills time.  games get points, but i don't like the touchscreen controls for some of them.
0688152023|5|I heard about this book several years ago, and never bought it.  Now I am sorry for my lapse.  It made me feel so strong and beautiful.  But even more so, my body felt fantastic when I was done.  It is wonderful to feel  how every muscle in my body works, and that is what this book did for me.   The exercises are challenging, but they made me feel great.  I highly  recommend it to anyone looking for a new and exciting way to tone their  body.

B000BRBA8S|5|At the core of `2046' (the sequel to the ravishing `In the Mood for Love') lies that provocative question.  Can one truly love another and receive the same burgeoning love in return?  One may quickly respond in the affirmative, but one must really sit back and question what their idea of love really is.  When watching `2046' it almost because too obvious that no two people can love one another in the same way, thus proving the point that no true form of love is reciprocated.<br /><br />Sobering, I know.<br /><br />In `2046' we once again follow the character of Chow Mo-wan (thankfully played once again by Tony Leung).  The film takes place a few years after the affairs recorded in `In the Mood for Love', this time focusing on Chow's affairs with a number of women.  2046 is a hotel room number.  We first see this room when Chow accompanies an old acquaintance, a beautiful woman who is later stabbed by a jealous boyfriend.  On a whim, Chow offers to rent out the room, only to take the room next to it, 2047.  Over the next few years the room 2046 becomes somewhat of a symbol for Chow's determination to find love.  Through his interactions with three women (a card shark named Black Widow, his landlord's daughter, Wang Jing-wen and a beautiful prostitute named Bai Ling) we discover many sides to Chow but also discover the root of this film.<br /><br />No two loves are the same, thus no love can truly be reciprocated.<br /><br />2046 thus becomes the focal point of a work of fiction Chow writes to reflect his own emotional feelings.  2046 becomes a year, a year where everything stays the same, a year where many people travel to regain lost memories.  2046 represents the love that Chow felt for Su Li-zhen (his love portrayed by Maggie Cheung in `In the Mood for Love').<br /><br />While I found Tony Leung to be truly effective, I also found him to be a canvas on which his female co-stars painted their elaborate pictures of self expression.  Gong Li, Faye Wong and the brilliant Ziyi Zhang were all phenomenal here.  Zhang especially is all sorts of Oscar worthy here.  It's a shame that the performance getting all sorts of Oscar awards buzz that year was her weaker `Memoirs of a Geisha' performance.  Here she is utterly astonishing, carrying the emotional cavity of her character without every losing the flirtatious quality that made her mysteriously engaging.  Wong also holds her own VERY well, creating a woman who is young and naïve yet enticing.  Li is always marvelous, but what she does here with such little screen time is unforgettable (that breakdown against the wall...OMG).<br /><br />While I don't think that `2046' is as strong as `In the Mood for Love', I must say that this is a perfect compliment.  It takes that films burning desire and amplifies it with luscious sequences that burn themselves into our minds.  Director Kar Wai Wong's stylistic approach to his work is in full effect here as he creates unforgettable imagery that perfectly compliments the emotional gravity of his story.<br /><br />Pain has never looked so inviting.Zhang especially is all sorts of Oscar worthy here.

B006RUJST6|5|Colleen Hoover has written one fabulous story! It is indescribably amazing. Like wow! You need to check this out. One of the best chick lit/romance books I have read! They need to get on making this into a movie! It would sure be a hit!

B00FAPF5U0|5|Completely addictive game. Doesn't matter if its me or my 4 yr old we love this game
B00BD99JMW|5|Best book series I've ever read. I thought it was better than the hunger games trilogy and I didn't think anything could be better until I read the divergent series
B006LSZECO|5|I thought Gone Girl started out a bit slow, but hold on because it really blows up.  It is told from such a unique perspective that I can't say I've experience in another book.  It alternates between the male and female main characters.  They are narrating from their perspective, but never fully revealing the truth to the reader.  What results is that you are constantly changing your opinion about the characters and what actually happened.  Gillian Flynn creates the some of the most complicated, flawed and disturbing characters of any author writing today, and this book is no exception.  Highly recommended!
0380002930|5|I first saw the cartoon movie when I was only 10. I was so enthralled with the imagery that was in the movie that I checked the book out of the school library the very next day. I remeber that it was a hard back book with a map of the fields inside the cover. It took me all of one week to read the entire book. My teacher thought I should have read a shorter book to do my report on as the book was so long. I received an A+ as I usually did on my reports. I highly recommend this book for kids, and adults. It is one of my favorite all time books.<br />The imagery that you get from the book is so much more than the movie tried to provide. The book deals with the society of a warren of rabbits. How they deal with each other, leadership, their culture and their journey on finding a place to call home.
0812548094|1|Is this only the second book in the series?  Feels like it was written 1000 times before, only better, and by better writers.
B00G3L6KQI|2|Liked the first, tolerated the second, didn't like the third. The story was not engaging. I'm a fast reader but found myself bored and had to force myself through parts. I think this is partly because the author has trouble writing interactions between the characters. The dialogue is flat and the POV changes inelegantly. There's a lot of explanation needed because the no texture comes from conversations or character interactions. I also found that what little depth the characters had in previous books was lost completely in this one. The villains were especially one-dimensional and boringly simple. I would pass on this and imagine your own end to the series.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I did not like mockingjay by Suzanne Collins I loved it! It's the best action and love story ever written. I have read this series at least twice.
030746363X|5|I thought Tim did a great job with this book. He explores new avenues towards redefining yourself as a person, and while I can't yet state the effectiveness of it all (this stuff takes time), I do hold out significant hope for some of his suggestions. I am not a gullible person, have tried many exercise programs before, some very successfully. What is enticing about Tim's is that they are significantly more simple and less-time consuming, while still following some good science.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Up until 1:30 a.m., unable to put this book down, I loved the depth of the characters. My favorite line in the book is the description of marriage being \\"love hovering over aggravation.\\" (Maybe that's not quite how it was written, but 42 years into my marriage, that hits the mark!)  how wonderful it is to find a new, favorite author. Thanks so much.
B00SH00N3Y|5|Great movie! Love the special effects and it had plenty of gun play for those that like it. Really like the way Lucy put it to the bad guys. I would recommend this movie to anyone that doesn't mind a little violence or blood. Thought the end was over the top. Great movie for those that are a little into SC-fi. Had a great balance.
B009LMTDL0|5|As a young woman in college, this book has already taken my success to new heights.  I have recommended this book to all my female friends and family while giving my significant other chapters to focus on!  READ THIS BOOK!  It will empower you.

0062502182|5|This book was assigned reading in an english class i took, and at first i thought it would suck. After all, who wants to read a story about some kid from Andalusia who follows his dream to egypt? Once I picked it up and started reading, however, I found that I genuinely enjoyed it. It is one of the better pieces I have read concerning the interrelation of God, luck, omens, coincidence, destiny, and one's part ina ll this. However, readers who do not want to view this book as more than a simple story will miss out on the bigger messages; whether the messages mean anything or not is a personal choice. I recomend this book to any prospective buyers.
B00FL3C8E2|5|Very funny and realistic book on the life a self made millionaire and some of the workings of shady Wall Street firms... I now spend more time doing my own due diligence on stocks and bonds instead of believing what my broker tells me !
B004U7JYXS|5|Great deal!! I love it! :)
1476746583|5|Very nice and intriguing story.Good summer reading
B000001FA4|5|This album is the quintessential must have for any U2 fan! The songs eb and flow in a poetic ballet to bring out emotion and instant loyalty to the listener. This album is very powerful in lyrics and music all wrapped together in huge beautiful package by the masterful production talent of the great Brian Eno. A MASTERPIECE!
B004YM6JI2|5|Supernatural is simply addictive viewing. I watched season 7 as it was screened on tv so I can't wait for this box set to be released, so I can watched it again and again and again!!

0425252868|5|I found the complex intertwining of lives in the balance, and their ultimate fates, to be moving beyond words. For such a young author who is of a generation that is only now re-learning the terrible price of history and its consequences through no fault of its own, Adam Makos has done a remarkable job. He writes in a concise yet evocative and very personal manner that arouses tremendous empathy without excessive indulgence in graphic details, very much in the same vein as Peter Townsend's \\"Duel Of Eagles\\", John Bushby's \\"Gunner's Moon\\", Robert Denny's \\"Aces\\", Spencer Dunmore's \\"Bomb Run\\", N.J. Crisp's \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" and Martin Caidin's \\"The Last Dogfight\\", yet describes enough to leave the reader both shaken and deeply disturbed about some of the real costs of war. In the end, it leaves one saddened but wiser and perhaps hopeful that we, as a race, may learn from generations of foolhardy political ambition and unmindful pride that the destruction, suffering and dying --- the sheer waste --- are simply not worth it when there are better avenues, if only we had the courage to take the pathways against those who would lead us astray.<br /><br />Of great noteworthiness is the in-depth look at the very real humanity of the Luftwaffe's fighter pilots ; their hopes, dreams, fears and emotions, and their ultimate black despair in the face of the rolling tide of war that would drown most of these young men. There is a terrible, breathless inevitability in the chapters that cover the period towards the war's end. It is now better known that of 28,000 fighter pilots who flew with the Luftwaffe, only about 1,200 survived the war, an appalling casualty rate by any standard. The one salient feature that stands out from all this tragedy is the seemingly indomitable spirit of the \\"Experten\\" ( aces ) who fought and died with chivalry and honor against all odds, and never lost sight of their humanity and self-respect in the process. Thankfully, at least a small handful survivedto tell their side of history and impart many priceless, hard-won lessons to the rest of us. Legendary names such as Walter Krupinski, Hans-Joachim Marseille, Adolf Galland, Johannes Steinhoff, Hannes Trautloft, Gunther Luetzow and Gerhard Barkhorn --- both the quick and the dead --- are all there in the text, and seen in a very personal and human light as individuals in their own right.<br /><br />Another thing that Makos highlights, both directly and indirectly, is the indescribable physical and emotional toll the war took on the families of the aircrews on both sides, reminding us once again that the effects of conflict have an impact far beyond the front lines.<br /><br />The only issues I had with the book comprised mostly small but glaring technical errors such as the line on Page 169 describing Engine 1 on Charlie Brown's B-17F as being a Pratt & Whitney ( every B-17 ever built, with the exception of the prototype Model 299, XB-38 derivative and perhaps a few other experimental testbed aircraft, was powered by various models of the 9-cylinder Wright GR-1820 Cyclone radial engine ), and the reference on Page 174 to the aircraft's aluminum skin being a few centimeters (!) thick ( I think the author really meant to say millimeters, which would have been more correct ).<br /><br />Other than that, I feel that Makos has written a well-balanced and poignant account that encompasses on a very intimate level the threads of so many lives that have been inextricably entwined forever by fate and the winds of war.
B001G5ZNFK|5|Wow! A classic Jazz Album -- a must have for Vinyl Jazz Collector
B00475AYJQ|5|Very original concept. Very well written  continues a interesting tail
072325804X|2|The book in the photo is what I wanted and have given as a gift before. The one I received was a totally different cover not even similar! I didn't like it as well but there was not enough time to try an exchange with you before I needed to give the gift at a special occasion. Totally disappointed in you. Meredith
B00NDEX0W0|5|I remember reading QB VII by Leon Uris in college and enjoying it greatly.  I was later excited to see the tv mini-series, one of the first ever.  I enjoyed it and had not seen it again for many years until watching this dvd set.  It still holds up well.<br />One of my favorite actors Ben Gazzara gave his usual intense, outstanding performance as Abraham Cady, a Jewish-American author sued for libel by a fairly-young Anthony Hopkins as the Polish/British refugee doctor, Adam Kelno, who Cady has  accused of war crimes in his best-selling book on the Jewish people.  Leslie Caron appears as Kelno's wife, Dan O'Herlihy as Cady's publisher and the beautiful Lee Remick as Cady's British girlfriend.  The film is also populated by many outstanding British actors of their day: Sir John Gielgud, Anthony Quayle, Jack Hawkins, Robert Stephens and Michael Gough.  (There is also an interesting James Bond connection: Cady's orthodox religious father is played by Joseph Wiseman, who earlier portrayed the first Bond villain, Dr. No.  Other Bond veterans in this film include Julian Glover, &#34;Kristados&#34; of &#34;For Your Eyes Only&#34; and Vladek Sheybal, &#34;Kronsteen&#34; of &#34;From Russia With Love.&#34;)<br />Much of this excellent mini-series was produced on location in Israel.  The outstanding musical score is by the great Jerry Goldsmith.<br />Sadly, there are no extras on this double dvd set.  However the picture quality is excellent and it was great seeing this classic again.  Highly recommended and well worth the money.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Great game....when will I get the next Room? It took me about 3 hours total, I think, I got lost in the fun! I'll be watching for the next one. Well worth the $2.
B0073XV2W2|5|Great techno-thriller! I fly RC helicopters as a hobby. Last year, I remarked to a friend of mine that, in just a few years, the government will probably make it illegal to fly these &#34;toys&#34;. This book describes a very plausible scenario, where autonomous drones, big and small, could quickly make our current military weapons obsolete.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Bought new Fire phone and gave up level 386 to start over at 1!!!!  Argh!!!! Still worth it
0375812024|5|Fantastic book with great pictures. I immediately plasticized it for durability before allowing the little kids to look at the pictures.
B00EL8I8IS|3|The movie concludes rather abruptly, holes in logic of plot. That said, it is decent brainless (pun intended) movie for Prime watchers, I wouldn't pay to see it.
B005CRQ2IU|4|Very enjoyable read, took a while to get in to the groove of a comics book, but once you figure it out - you find the story to be compelling and fun to read
0142421715|2|Of the trilogy, this one is the dog. As with a lot of middle books, this one slowed down and didn't get a lot accomplished as far as truly advancing the story. It could have been condensed down into a 60 page or so Part One for book three. Really, all the that was accomplished by this book was a lot of teen angst in the desert. Dull.
B00ESNDQWY|4|Love the characters
B005LAIIPS|4|Not anything like the Bourne movies but it was okay.  I guess this way we know that we already knew, that there are other people in the program.  Sure miss Jason.  Nothing can compair.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I have always been fascinated with John Grisham's books. I love how he focuses on the South and its people. Always exciting and yet an interesting and, I believe accurate, picture of things that can happen in real life.
B008Q0D32S|5|great movie

B00ABGEFWC|5|My daughter is 7.  She can't put this game down.  This is the first time that she is as interested in &#34;gaming&#34; as my son.  Furthermore, she is practicing recognizing large numbers and their related values and even getting some exposure to saving and spending.
B00785P2QC|4|I enjoy this game, though it needs a better tutorial.  Some of the pricing makes it difficult to proceed also.
B002QE3CTY|5|&#34;Maze Runner&#34; begins with a teenage boy waking in a moving cargo elevator. He can not remember anything about his life prior to that moment, except he knew his name was Thomas. All of his other memories had been erased. Many things brought about a faint recollection but remained just outside his grasp, like looking at images through an opaque glass. The elevator was moving up, and at the completion of this journey the doors at the top were flung open and a rope was lowered to bring him out.<br /><br />Thomas found himself in an immense square courtyard surrounded by massive walls. In the middle of each of the four walls was a doorway, which he later found led into the maze. He met Alby, the leader, and second in command Newt. All the inhabitants were teenage boys, perhaps 60 total, and ranged in age from about 12 to 18. He had many questions, especially since his memories were gone, but Alby acted like answering questions were an inconvenience he didn't have time for. Newt was a little more accommodating, but for every question he answered Thomas thought of two more. As it was getting late, Thomas was told to get some sleep and he would be shown around the next day. Chuck, the previous &#34;newby,&#34; was to find him a place to sleep.<br /><br />From what Thomas was able to piece together, some of the boys had been there for as long as two years. They had runners out in the maze every day, looking for a way out. The other boys all had jobs to keep busy. Farmers, butchers, carpenters, and more, the little community was almost self sustaining. Once every month a new boy would arrive, Thomas being the latest. Once a week supplies would arrive from the creators, the name the boys gave to their keepers. At the end of each day, the runners would come back and make a map of the portion of the maze they explored. They found that the walls of the maze moved from day to day, making it more difficult to find the solution. At sunset, the walls next to each doorway would slide closed and seal the courtyard.<br /><br />On his first night there, Thomas was taken to a window to look into the maze. He got his first glimpse of the grievers, a combination of animal and machine. About the size of a cow, the grievers had no discernible head or tail. They had robotic arms with tools attached which could maim or kill. The arms could be extended or retracted at will, as well as small spikes which the creature used for locomotion. If a person was stung by a griever, they would have to take a serum or face death. The serum caused what the boys called &#34;the change&#34; and consisted of about three days of painful withdrawal like symptoms. However, the change would bring some of the victims lost memories back. The grievers could appear at any time, but they always came out at night. Therefore, the two most important rules were 1) stay out of the maze unless you are a runner, and 2) under no circumstance get caught in the maze at night.<br /><br />On Thomas's second day in the glade, as his new home was known, everything changed. The siren sounded announcing the arrival of another new member. There had never been more than one arrive per month, let alone on consecutive days. Also, this time it was a girl, another first. She was somehow familiar to Thomas, but remained just outside the grasp of his memory. These were not the only things to change. Thomas knew he was there for a reason, but again his lack of memory confounded him. Working with his new found friends, and against his enemies, Thomas must help find a way out of the maze. Time was running short and failure meant a certain death.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this dystopian view of the future. I especially liked the memory wipe and finding out things as Thomas himself was. The cause of the world's problems is very believable and actions of those pulling the strings were understandable, if not loathsome. The action flowed smoothly and the book was hard for me to put down. Iwould put this on par with the hunger games, although I will have to finish the other two books in the trilogy to get a more complete picture.
B004LWZWGK|5|Great movie, and those shots in IMAX cameras are just crazy, high resolution.<br /><br />A must to have to test/demonstrate your Home Theather :)
B002UM5BXW|5|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book? I have wanted to read it for years. First purchase I made on my Kindle. Devored the book in two days. If you have every worked in a restaurant you will be laughing and shaking your head yes through out this book.<br />The only person who might not want to read this book is the person who loves to eat out and just doesn't want to know all the bad things that might be happening to their dish before it hits the table. Other than that buy, consume, enjoy and thank me later.
B008MG1E4A|5|Well worth the read - a fascinating story from beginning to end. I had just finished reading it when 60 Minutes aired their interview with the author.  That interview covered the highlights, but there are more details in the book.  I couldn't put it down!
B005Q1W10A|5|This is the best series to come along in a very long while.  I have purchased all 3 season and love every one.
B00AQ71FLK|4|It is a great game,  ut it really needs to have an offline mode.<br />I spend a good bit of my time without wifi, so I am left without any way to play this.<br />if it ever gets an offline mode, then it would be perfect.
B0000562RG|5|Midnight's soaring vocals and Jon Drenning's blazing leads make this album an instant classic. Crimson Glory set all of the standards with this groundbreaking release. Don't expect to hear musicianship like this in today's hopeless atmosphere of grunge, alternative, and RB garbage. Crimson Glory was everything that most so-called &quot;bands&quot; of today are not. Shifting time signatures, inventive melodies, fiery lead runs, vocals that fly into the stratosphere... it's all here.
B000002VCU|5|\\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" was The Alan Parson Project's 5th album.  It came out in 1980, and remains one of my all-time favorite APP discs.  This concept album focuses on the attraction and despair associated with gambling.<br /><br />Overall, this album has the same general force and feel as \\"I Robot\\", thus departing from pop efforts on \\"Pyramid\\" and \\"Eve\\". This album, therefore, sees APP going back to its earlier harder driving progressive rock sounds of \\"Mystery and Imagination\\" and \\"I Robot.\\"  And, there is still something for just about everyone on this disc.<br /><br />As for the individual tracks...<br />- \\"May Be A Price to Pay\\" is reminiscent of \\"The Raven\\" in its general overall feel...good stuff!<br />- \\"Games People Play\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Go Home\\", and \\"Snake Eyes\\" have upbeat tempos and a solid progressive rock sound.  They have great techno-support and, at least to me, epitomize the definitive APP progressive rock sound.<br />- \\"Time\\" is one of APP's top all time hits.  It is a calmer, reflective piece, somewhat like \\"To One In Paradise\\" from \\"Tales of Mystery...\\", and is one of my all-time favorite mellow APP offerings.<br />- \\"Ace of Swords\\" and \\"The Gold Bug\\" are both strong tracks. I always looked forward to seeing what APP was going to do for an instrumental track or two on each of their albums.  These did not disappoint.<br />- \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" - This is the most mellow, and reflective track on the disc.  It suggests the hopelessness that gambling sometimes sdaly produces.<br />- Finally, the title track \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" is included in two parts, and they tie the album together.  It's a great sound.<br /><br />\\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" is, in my opinion, hands down, one of the absolute best APP albums ever produced.  If you are thinking about seeing what APP music is all about, this is one of the albums you should definitely investigate.<br /><br />5 stars all the way!!!!!<br /><br />-- a 30+ year APP listener

B000002H70|5|This was the album that got me (and a lot of other people) into The Cure.  You've heard &quot;Love Song,&quot; &quot;Fascination St.,&quot; &quot;Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Pictures of You&quot; on the radio, and if  you have a heart, you liked them.  So did I, and that's why I bought the  album... and was just blown away by the sound, the songs, the lyrics, the  voice.  Every song on here is a classic, that really stands up against any  song, anywhere.  I almost feel bad recommending particular songs, but  &quot;Last Dance,&quot; &quot;Prayers for Rain,&quot; &quot;The Same Deep  Water As You,&quot; &quot;Disintegration,&quot; and &quot;Untitled&quot;  are absolutely flawless songs, perfect in every way.  Buy BLOODFLOWERS  because that will keep the group on the radio, but after you do, you must  own this album.  Even if you aren't a Cure fan, you must own this album.   Except for THE SOUL CAGES, I can't think of another album that I have liked  this much from the first time I heard it until now.  Take this one to your  desert island.

0375707972|4|I will give you some good reasons why you should read this book.  <br />Although this is a book about the Holocaust, it is not primarily a book about the suffering of the Jews.  It is instead a book about the Germans  and, more importantly, the legacy of the Holocaust which has been left to a  new generation who have had to deal with the disturbing and sometimes cruel  knowledge of what their parents and loved ones may have done (or failed to  do) during the Nazi era.<br />When reading this book, I found myself wondering  what I would be like if I were a young modern German and had to deal with  the knowledge that my parents and grandparents did nothing to stop the  horror of those times or perhaps may have actively contributed to it.   Michael has the misfortune to fall in love with an older woman who was  complicit in a horrible crime.  The question that torments him is this; how  can I be a good, warm, loving person if the person I love more than any  other has done such a terrible thing?  The story of Hanna, and his own  inexplicable love and regard for her, haunts him throughout his life.   Michael's quest to understand why this should be so is the basis for much  of this subtly compelling book. <br />Perhaps it is the banality of Hanna's  secret - ie. that she is illiterate - that is the reason some reviewers  have felt disappointed by this book.   We are so used to stories of the  Holocaust such as &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; where the magnitude of the  suffering seems to dwarf anything we could possibly imagine and if that is  the type of story you are looking for, &quot;The Reader&quot; will not  deliver that.  However, the value of this work is that it looks at another  aspect of the Holocaust, that is to say, the way in which young Germany has  had to try to come to terms with the crimes of the past.  This is an  interesting subject to me.   <br />If you do not want to read yet another  forumlaic book about those dreadful times, and if you want your mindto be  open to another perspective of the Holocaust, then I recommend that you  read this book.
B000WEMH3C|1|Too flimsy.  I bought it in December and the top ripped open in July with a normal wind.  6 months and it's destroyed itself.
1932100660|5|very well written and presented with data you cannot argue with.  It is a shame larger hospitals, corporations, and government are spinning information to increase their financial livelihood versus our well-being.  A must read for everyone of all ages.  As consumers, we have the power to demand changes from these large entities.  Becoming informed is the first step.  This book does just that.

0790731452|4|This has got be to be the ultimate parody of every 50s sci-fi alien flick. You can't possibly take this movie other than the comedy it was intended to be, it's got spoof written all over it. My favorite scene is Glenn Close, as the presidents wife, getting creamed by a huge falling  chandelier due to alien firearms. The ending is endearing when they discover the remedy to the alien beings lies within a hard of hearing old grandma who fancies the worst melodies on vinyl, repeatedly. The other great scene is the interchanging of human and animal forms in alien saucer. Even the promo for this flick had the aliens with uncouth eyeballs stirring about. Very campy to say the least, and I think Independance Day has met it's match!

B000OCXF0Q|4|The way this record was made is rather interesting... I want to make things clear, I LOVE Avril and her music, and that I do like the songs on this album.. It's just that I think that she's taken a step back in terms of personal growth and maturity despite being married... <br />First, the look... Pink hair extensions?? So Christina Aguilera in 2002, though Christina's was dark red and black extentions... <br />Next we go into the making of the record. I can say, from what is documented, about a third of the recording was done when she was high from alcohol... Like I've mentioned, the process maybe rather interesting, like using the sound of blowing into a beer bottle at the end of Girlfriend, but it somehow just doesn't connect to the Avril we knew before and that it seems a little childish... <br />However, there are nice creative input from other famous artists, like her husband, Deryck Whibley (Sum 41) and Travis Barker (Blink 182).. <br />Overall, I think Avril is great! Though, she may need a little more time in the maturity department.. However, I think that the antics of her recording process haven't compromised the quality much and I can't wait to see what comes next!

0553108034|5|Reading through some of the reviews posted about this book I was upset but at the same time in agreeance with the reviewers.  I WAS initially surprised at the language and sex scenes portrayed in the novel.  I hadn't  encountered that in many other fantasy novels. Katharine Kerr includes some  but they are more inventive and funny than offensive.  Not to say that  GRRM's use is offensive, however.  It was refreshing almost to have an  accurate portrayal of a kingdom vying for control of the throne by using  some occasional swear words.  We all know that those words were'nt invented  for the '90s so people must have used them in GRRM's world also.  As to the  sex, its out there and its rampant!  To not include it in one form or  another in this type of story would leave out one very important key: the  falibility of human kind.  You can't have perfect characters set in this  type of environment.  the two just would not mesh.

1439107955|5|For those of us who are fascinated with science and medicine, yet do not read heavy textbooks for pleasure, this is the perfect book.  I first heard a review on NPR, and the author was interviewed on another show, and I was intrigued.  How can you make such a difficult and emotional topic sound interesting, entertaining and understandable.  This book does it by providing almost a Fiction approach to the autobiography of cancer.  It is a long read, but a worthwhile investment of your time.
B000RHFZ9C|5|From the liner notes of the 1997 CD, \\"Sgt. Peppers Monomix\\":    \\"The only real version of Sgt. Pepper is the mono version,\\" says former Beatles sound engineer Richard Lush.  \\"There are all sorts of things on the mono, little effects here and there, which the stereo didn't have.\\"    Because stereo wasn't as commonplace in the 60s, the mono mixes were always given top priority.  That meant that in this case the mono mixing was done with much love and care, with the Beatles in attendance, whereas the stereo mixes were made in just a few hours afterward by producer George Martin alone.  Of course, stereo was soon to take over and this meant that this original mono mix with all its subtle differences (like, for example, \\"She's Leaving Home\\" played at the right speed rather than slowed down as it is on the stereo) was soon deleted.    So we belatedly celebrate the 30th anniversary of this masterpiece by releasing FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 60'S the 1967 mono mix with the tracklisting in the very order as it was originally intended, with BONUS TRACKS.    Track Listing:    1. Intro: Crowd Noise  2. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  3. With a Little Help From My Friends  4. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite  5. Fixing a Hole  6. Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds  7. Getting Better  8. She's Leaving Home  9. Within You, Without You  10. When I'm Sixty-Four  11. Lovely Rita  12. Good Morning, Good Morning  13. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)  14. A Day in the Life  15. Run Out Groove  16. Applause for Sgt. Pepper    BONUS TRACKS  17. Only a Northern Song (\\"true\\" mono mix)  18. Strawberry Fields Forever (rough mix of the best unreleased orchestrated version)  19. Penny Lane (recorded \\"off\\" monitor, no flute overdubs)    From \\"The Making of Sgt. Pepper\\" TV Special; early takes of:  20. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  21. Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds  22. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite  23. Within You, Without You  24. Good Morning, Good Morning  25.A Day in the Life (fading into an unused rough mix without orchestra overdub and without last chord)  26. Outro: Animal Noises (for later use in \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\")
B00C74SHRK|4|The Goldfinch<br /><br />It deserves four stars for the wonderful language, the highly original plot, the well -developed characters. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is the few instances of too much of a &#34;muchness&#34;... detail that just becomes a trifle boring. Well boring is perhaps not the right word, because during the last 200 or so pages I wished the book would never end.
B0017ANAZO|4|I bought this movie ..along with a much earlier version of it....they were both great ...recommend it for anyone wanting to enjoy a good time.
B00006JDSI|5|Still the eeriest and most atmospheric of all the Dracula films, Murnau's \\"Nosferatu\\" gave the German director an opportunity to explore experimental visual techniques--like stop-motion and negative exposures--in bringing Bram Stoker's version of the legend to the big screen. But his biggest coup was in casting the mysterious Max Schreck (rumored to be another actor's alias) in the title role. With his rat-like features, ghastly pointed ears, and long, talon-like fingers, Schreck doesn't seem at all like a creature from our planet. Murnau completed the effect by filming on location in Eastern Europe. The result is a Gothic chiller you simply can't miss.

B00E8KLWB4|2|You need to change somethings. First, when a &quot;new goal&quot; comes out and tells me to go to a picture to find it and I waste what little energy is given on it and NOTHING is found. That is just plain pissing off BS. It happened 3 time in one setting in 3 different pics. Then you want me to spend money to get more energy. Ridiculous. If that doesn't change I'm deleting it and not getting any more of your games. The other is way too little energy and no way to generate crystals. Would be a great game if these were fixed.
B003MC5N28|5|This book was GREAT! I really enjoyed the book, tells a really good story about living a life in uniformity. Very good book. Would definetly recommend to friend. I say the age group is 6th or 7th grade or above because the author uses some very strong word choice that may be hard to understand.
B0002XH9Z4|5|Unless you are going to include EVERY Michael Jackson song and EVERY demo and EVERY B-Side and EVERY Remix, you can't call any collection of Michael Jackson's music \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" but the normally sloppy Sony Records did a nice try with this package. <br /> <br />Out of all the \\"Best Of\\" Michael Jackson stuff flooding the market these days, this is the best. <br /> <br />Why? <br /> <br />Well for starters it includes some awesome unreleased stuff from different eras (Sunset Driver, Monkey Business, In The Back) <br /> <br />All the usual Michael hits are here (Except Scream and a few others from HIStory *Disc 2*) <br /> <br />It even offers a very interesting remix on 'Who Is It\\" (I like Michael's album version better - but the remix is an interesting change of pace.) <br /> <br />The new songs are AWESOME. (The Way You Love Me & We've Had Enough) are just proof enough that Michael never lost his talent and still has it. <br /> <br />The concert DVD shows Michael moonwalking, shaking and singing his heart out from the Dangerous tour. (Must see performances of Billie Jean and Human Nature make this concert a must.) <br /> <br />Personally, I'm still hoping one day Michael releases either a full album of vaulted songs. Because, honestly, some of the vaulted songs on this package (Sunset Driver, Monkey Business & more) are awesome! While they sound dated, they still hold up better than 95% of the music being put out today. And that says a lot. <br /> <br />Will The King of Pop stand up? Welcome to the stage Michael Jackson. Or in this case your CD player. Buy The Ultimate Collection and you will have Michael's hits waiting for you to discover over and over again along with some vaulted songs and new stuff! Ultimate Collection - Nah, not hardly. Awesome Collection - Without a doubt!  Cheers!

B0067Q42BY|4|This is an enjoyable game and a great time waster. The only issue I have is that when a call comes in and my game is interrupted, it doesn't save my progress in the board layout I'm currently playing. Even if I'm nearly finished in a particular tile layout, it will make me restart the layout after the interruption. Please fix this glitch and I will change to five stars. Otherwise, a very enjoyable game. Will consider Artifacts 2.

The story is inane,the subplots are isipid,the score is even mundane.

B0017ZB8M6|5|Katy Perry's One of the Boys is definitely one of the top CDs of 2008.     Why?  Because her lyrics are crisp, witty, & genuine, the music bright & foot-tapping memorable, and the studio production masterful. Taken together, this is a great example of a true artist who holds nothing back & brings a fresh energy to an increasingly self-absorbed & cliche music scene.    I myself enjoyed all of the songs. My favs of course are \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" with it's driving beat & haughty lyrics and \\"Ur So Gay\\" with it's clever quick fire lyrics sung with emotional exapseration ... & I love the horns & great production on this track. The production of the entire CD really brings out everything that Katy puts into the lyrics and music. Listen with your headphones to see what I mean.     It's an album which never runs out of energy or authenticity. \\"One of the Boys\\", \\"Thinking of You\\", \\"I'm Still Breathing\\" & \\"Mannequin\\" each has a story to tell both in words and music. Perry's energy & intuition flows through each song.    Not all may like her edgy delivery, but as a singer/songwriter, Katy nails it. Don't take her lyrics literally, they're more an exploration of emotions & ideas . . . though I do feel sorry for the guy with no penis.

1250007208|5|I don't want to explain the story or tear it apart...not my style or what I'm good at. I do want to say I loved it. I'm, shhhh, almost 50 but enjoy YA a lot. This is one book I read faster than I usually read books. Thoroughly enjoyed the world created and the spin on the Cinderella fairy tail. Enjoyed the writing style, tone, and nature in which the story was told. I laughed quite a bit, even cried - but get emotional that way pretty easily.<br /><br />Some idea of what I do like to put in perspective to your own tastes: Adult books from Pride & Prejudice, along with regency romance to Lois McMaster Bujold's books featuring Mile Vorkosigan and Tolkien's Fellowship. For YA I will not apologize for enjoying Twilight series, loved The Hunger Games series and have enjoyed multiple readings of Harry Potter to name some.

0307277453|5|Excellent read.  A nice account of Tiktaalik's discovery and impact by the primary investigator, and a fascinating round-up of various bone shape and function changes in the evolution of fish to amphibians and thence to mammals.<br /><br />It does get bogged down in a couple spots with unexpected reviews of VERY basic concepts of evolution, inheritance, etc -- appropriate for middle-school science students or maybe evolution-deniers, neither of which are likely to be the audience here.  But these can be skimmed quickly to get back to the juicier content.

B00K3Q0XGM|3|Being born in 1972 I mostly missed the early years of Chicago (1969-1975). I remember hearing &#34;If You Leave Me Now&#34; (1976) and of course other top 40 Chicago hits from then on, particularly their 1982 reinvention &#34;Hard For Me To Say I'm Sorry/Get Away&#34; and all their 1980's hits. Something happened after &#34;Chicago 19&#34; in 1988--the band faded out of the limelight, particularly with the truly awful &#34;Chicago Twenty 1&#34; in 1991, followed by an average big band album &#34;Night & Day&#34; in 1995 and a Christmas album in 1998. I thought the band all but relegated to the touring circuit until 2006's surprise &#34;Chicago XXX&#34; followed quickly in 2008 with a long delayed released of &#34;Stone Of Sisyphus&#34;, and yet another Christmas needless Christmas album.<br /><br />I was surprised to see &#34;Now&#34; coming down the pike, and without hesitation I bought it. I wanted to see where the band is at, now. Meanwhile, I finally went back and bought all of their albums beginning with 1969's &#34;Chicago Transit Authority&#34;. I believe the first Chicago album I ever bought was 1986's &#34;Chicago 18&#34; (I know, I know, why, right? Well it was 1986, and I was only 14! What did I know?!)<br /><br />Prior to making this review I took weeks to listen to every Chicago album in chronological order to see how they began, changed, changed again, and where they are now in comparison. I skipped their live albums and compilation albums and holiday albums and stuck with just their studio albums.<br /><br />First, the biggest change with &#34;Now&#34; is the absence of Bill Champlin who began appearing with the band on 1982's &#34;Chicago 16&#34;. Second, in listening to all of Chicago's albums I am keenly aware of how important Robert Lamm was to the band in the beginning and how he somehow became sidelined, especially after the death of Terry Kath in 1978. Third, it is my stubborn observational opinion after listening to all of Chicago's albums that after Kath's death the band changed and never returned to their 'glory days' which I consider to be 1969-1977. To me, the band's albums during that time were pretty damn strong, consistent and, overall, very good.<br /><br />So, &#34;Now&#34;? Well, it does sort of have a 70's vibe to it. It does feel like the famous Chicago horns are more front and center than they have been since, say, 1979's &#34;Chicago 13&#34;. Lyrically, there are more politically themed songs than any Chicago album since &#34;Chicago XI&#34;. Robert Lamm is more present here. The album is produced by the band and not David Foster. So, it would seem on the surface that &#34;Now&#34; would be a step in the right direction, and it is. But, like so many other bands/artists, Chicago doesn't quite hit &#34;Now&#34; out of the park. I would like to see what they do if they had to make a few more albums in quick succession to see if &#34;Now&#34; could be improved upon. Still, it's slightly better than &#34;Stone Of Sisyphus&#34; and &#34;XXX&#34; and better than &#34;Chicago Twenty 1&#34;.<br /><br />I agree with others that &#34;Now&#34; suffers from slick production (again). It also suffers from the band not playing together in a studio (like the good old days). &#34;Now&#34; comes off as adult contemporary jazz pop. There were some songs that I felt were pretty good like &#34;More Will Be Revealed&#34;, &#34;Love Lives On&#34;, &#34;Something's Coming, I Know&#34; and &#34;Naked In The Garden Of Allah&#34;. In fact, &#34;Love Lives On&#34; has the most potential to be a top 40 hit and is very reminiscent of their 80's ballads.<br /><br />Anyway, I would consider myself a belated Chicago fan. I can find things to like on each of their albums for the most part. I have never seen them live. I think, after listening to all of their albums, that I really enjoy &#34;Chicago Transit Authority&#34; as likely their best work--a stand alone work, in fact.<br /><br />So, here's how &#34;Now&#34; comparesto Chicago's other works:<br /><br />1969 Chicago Transit Authority: Five Stars<br />1970 II: Four and a Half Stars<br />1971 III: Four and a Half Stars<br />1972 V: Four and a Half Stars<br />1973 VI: Four and a Half Stars<br />1974 VII: Four and a Half Stars<br />1975 VIII: Four Stars<br />1976 X: Four Stars<br />1977 XI: Four Stars<br />1978 Hot Streets: Two and a Half Stars<br />1979 13: Two and a Half Stars<br />1980 XIV: One Star<br />1982 16: Two and a Half Stars<br />1984 17: Four Stars<br />1986 18: Three and a Half Stars<br />1988 19: Two and a Half Stars<br />1991 Twenty 1: One Star<br />2006 XXX: Two and a Half Stars<br />2008 Stone Of Sisyphus: Two and a Half Stars<br />2014 Now: Three Starsto Chicago's other works:<br /><br />1969 Chicago Transit Authority: Five Stars<br />1970 II: Four and a Half Stars<br />1971 III: Four and a Half Stars<br />1972 V: Four and a Half Stars<br />1973 VI: Four and a Half Stars<br />1974 VII: Four and a Half Stars<br />1975 VIII: Four Stars<br />1976 X: Four Stars<br />1977 XI: Four Stars<br />1978 Hot Streets: Two and a Half Stars<br />1979 13: Two and a Half Stars<br />1980 XIV: One Star<br />1982 16: Two and a Half Stars<br />1984 17: Four Stars<br />1986 18: Three and a Half Stars<br />1988 19: Two and a Half Stars<br />1991 Twenty 1: One Star<br />2006 XXX: Two and a Half Stars<br />2008 Stone Of Sisyphus: Two and a Half Stars<br />2014 Now: Three Stars
B00881VLCE|5|This was the only puzzle app that I found with numerous free puzzles, all of the other puzzle apps I downloaded charged for more puzzles.
B00C8S9W0G|4|I fell in love with Clair and Jamie and their children and friends. Life is an ongoing adventure for them all. Parts of the saga finally come together. There isn't really another book to read. This is #8, so I'm glad the author tied up some of the loose ends. I felt lost for a few days without being able to read more about their lives. It was especially nice to put their adventures into historical perspective. Of course the time travel aspect also added excitement. Well written. Worth reading.
B007IXWL2C|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The characters personalities were described in detail.  I was led to believe this story was about the sexual activities of the main character and almost didn't start reading the series.  Was very surprised and pleased to discover these three books were a very interesting love story about two very different people.
B005MLOKXA|5|Can't stop watching.
0007247095|5|This has to be one of the best books that I've read in a long time. It really makes you think about war and how it affects us. And how we need to stop children form becoming soldiers.
B00EW9GQR6|5|I own all of her albums, she definitely has a style of her own. There are some great tunes on here, sexxx dreams, do what u want, applause, g.u.y.<br /><br />Great dance music!!
B007IXWKUK|3|I thought the book was repiticious ultimately boring, however the main story line at least had some merit, and it definately leads you to the next book

B0060MYM3S|5|love this season had me hooked from the first episode! instantly ordered seaons 2 and 3 and binge watched them. The series is amazingly written and acted. I was constantly on the edge of me seat.
B00EV4EUT8|5|Pros:<br />Great perspectives on the US from the lenses of domestic services staff who worked in the White House . Very powerful and empowering. I am huge fan of Forrest Whitaker and really respect his body of work, even his role as the &#34;Drunk deadbeat father&#34; in Jason's Lyric. I am proud to see some insight on the many perspectives of the African American Community and glad that actors and directors are shedding light on those perspectives because these stories need to be uncovered.
B001ANSSDC|4|Amazing characters and storyline. Kept me interested and wanting to know more throughout the entire book.<br />Would recommend this to all of my friends.
031606792X|5|Absolutely breathtaking, the fourth book of the Twilight saga is by far the most intricate, delving deeper into the complicated facets of Meyer's magical world of innate abilities and immortals.  The sexual element that was more demure in the first three books was stronger here, but still not graphic, keeping it appropriate for slightly younger audiences.  I eagerly await further work from this author.
B007D2XSW0|5|this game is awesome because you can do what you want. and I like the frames you can put on. who woulden't like this game well it's not really a game more like an app.
B000KKPN5C|5|Cheap and works better than I could have ever expected.

0375704027|1|i can usually trust readers' reviews but i felt like i was steered in the wrong direction with this book.  i thought this book was so flat.  if it were a food, it'd be communion wafers.  i can appreciate the story of young love, the coming of age, the loss of innocence but the characters are so emotionally weak, obtuse, stupid.  i really disliked this book.  this was my first haruki book.  i wish i had read another one of his books before this one.  i'd like to give him another chance but this book left a sour taste in my mouth.  correction:  it left a chalky, bland taste in my mouth.
B00H4LL9JE|4|Another good volume of the Clifton Chronicles.  Now looking forward to number 5. Although left us up in the air, can only guess what happens!
B006ZDS7CE|5|This album is well worth the money. To be honest though, the first time you listen, you say to yourself \\"this is weird. Why did I buy this?\\" But then you keep listening. Somehow it goes from weird to \\"can't stop listening good\\". Highly recommend. Also, if you have some speakers or headphones that play the low-end frequencies, you will appreciate it on a whole new level.
B001AX9DT0|5|This is such a refreshing album.  Considering all of the dance/pop/synth voiceover stuff that is on the radio, this collection is such a breath of fresh air. I can't pick any one particular song, as the parts truly make the whole.  A must have!
B00RWJPS2C|5|Not just a classic--a companion forever.  &#34;I can think, I can fast, I can wait.&#34;  Words to live by.  If you have read it, nothing more needs to be said.  If you haven't, reading it is a life-changing event.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Loved it! Enjoyed every season. They are a very kind, loving family even with all the wealth.
B003CF0XDE|5|OMG! How could this be any better?
B00AVFO41K|4|At first I didn't like this game. I thought it popped up too many new ones with each move. I was determined to figure out a strategy and once I did I began enjoying the game. My top score is above 1500...so far. I keep two things in mind...diagonal and clear more than five.
B007XC9BSK|5|Great!!!
B008458O3S|4|Fun game,  some levels need more information on what's needed to complete.  Being from Edmonton I love the place names.
B00SWWPVSY|5|Wonderful! Picked up as FAOTD, but would have been worth a purchase. The Bot character instantly endears himself to the player, while smooth gameplay delights all around. Not too easy, not too hard, and beautiful to look at. Clean exit, no invasive permissions, runs offline, hooray! This is the type of game I normally can't put down -- it's binge play all the way. A user review heads-upped me that there were only 100 levels; this game was so cool that I actually STOPPED myself at level 20, to make it last longer. More fun for tomorrow! If/when the developer adds levels, I definitely feel it's worth $1-$2 to purchase the next pack.

B00003CX8J|5|When I went to see this movie at the very first showing in the morning on the day that it came out, I was praying really hard that they wouldn't totally butcher the comic that I had grown up with my whole life, but when I saw it with my not as enthused friends, I was totally awed and amazed. My friends loved it too, its action packed, with an actual really good plot and some twists thrown in that anyone can enjoy!
B00GOZQ2E8|4|It is a pretty good game over all. But it is annoying to pay to go fight monsters and pay more to build your city faster.
B0029EDMEG|5|there was Jesse Stone. Tom Selleck is great in this series. Night Passage is actually the first book in this Robert Parker series but apparantly was the second movie made, after Stone Cold.<br /><br />The action takes place in what is supposedly coastal Massachusetts but was filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, so, no, MA does not look like this at all. But, that is a quibble. The story is very good.
B00AQ6ZWV0|5|I love this book, this is my 3rd copy. I gave the other 2 to friends/family to read and pass on.

B005AVIW54|1|eople shouldn't make money from crime
B00933JF74|4|Fun game and slightly addictive. It is the sort you can keep spending real money on even if you have the premium version. To get the upgrades and xp points you can do little challenges as you grow your village or you can just buy extra xp from the app store. I'd give it five stars if I didn't have to see the little pop-up every 10mins asking me to buy xp.
B005MYEPXC|5|I had not seen the trailer for this movie nor really heard much about it. I was in the mood to travel so I watched it.  If you are a reader, writer or an art aficionado you will find this movie delightful. The movie is easy on the mind and has a great cast. It is now part of my movie collection. Makes a nice gift too.

The Heath's draw on psychology studies, marketing successes, as well as their own analyses to develop a book which is very useful, informative and entertaining - although I will say that I found the beginning a bit repetitious, so stick with the book, you will constantly learn new things.  Sticky ideas are important in all kinds of areas: technicians learn to do their jobs better by swapping job anecdotes.  <br /> <br /> The Heath's recognize that getting an idea to stick is not the same as conveying the full dimension of complex ideas, and they do not over simplify.  In fact, I wish some of the scientists would recognize, as the Heath's do, that while it is highly useful to draw on an existing schema to develop and present new ideas, such as the \\"selfish gene\\", schema's are approximate and are not sufficient to tell the whole story - maybe there would be fewer fruitless scientific arguments over which schema is correct. <br /> <br /> \\"Don't mess with Texas\\" (hugely successful anti-litter slogan). <br />

B00000JQFM|5|This cd absoultly just Rocks! ..Joe is brilliant! Nuff Said.
B000FSME1A|5|WOW! What an improvement. When I first saw the original, I thought:here's finally a movie for Vietnam vets. The cinematography and acting were great, but it looked like it had been edited with a hacksaw. Why is Lance water-skiing with Air CAv shorts before they run into the 1/9? And where did he get 'em? Where does he get that compact when he's putting on the camo face paint? Is that standard issue on a PBR? What's Kilgore's surfboard doing on the boat? How did it get there?Why is Clean so trigger-happy when they stop the sampan? And what happens to him after he's killed? They just throw his body overboard? That seems unlikely given the elaborate send-off Lance gives the Chief after he's wasted.    These questions and more are answered in this greatly expanded version of what's now my favorite movie. Alot has been made of how much the French Plantation Scene slows down the action. But I find it analogous to the Night Music in Stavinsky's Rite of Spring: after all the violence and discord you get a few minutes of breathing space before the insanity starts again. I speak French so maybe it's easier for me to relate to what's going     Unfortunately, not much can be done with the bizarre and incoherent last 20 minutes( the included deleted scenes at least show us what happended to the Photo-journalist and Colby and even give us the very interesting Monkey Sampan). But getting there has been maded so much more enjoyhable.    Anyway, this is a considerable improvement on an already great movie. Now, if they'd just bring it out in Blu-ray.
B00005RY7X|5|This CD is great. Well worth the time and money. From the first strains of It's Time to Party, through Don't Stop Livin' In The Red. WOW! I love it. Get it. Now.

The paragraphs are flowing attractively, and the more I read, the more I found the interesting knowledges and ideas within. This is a great true story, and also inspirational one I happened to stumble upon. There are not much sports writings that left me feeling good, energized, intrigued, and eager to try the techniques myself. This one does. I felt grateful and happy for McDougall to be willing to share this good writing.
B00006879E|5|I received this CD from a friend for Christmas, before the band released some of their other singles. I knew right away that this was a hit CD. I have never owned a CD where I can actually listen to all of the songs without skipping 1 or 2, or like so many CDs these days almost the entire album. This CD has so many great songs, I'm surprised they've only released 3 as singles, there could be at least 2 or 3 more that would make substantial play time on the radio. This is by far my favorite CD, and one of the best that I have ever owned. I've given this CD to many of my friends as gifts, and they all agree. I've also seen them in concert, and they rock! They sound really great live! Buy this CD if you haven't already!!

1559409002|5|Carnival of Souls aka &quot;Corridors of Evil&quot;, is a crowning jewel in American Cinema. Despite the low budget and poor film quality, this 1962 masterpiece stands as a cult more than 40 years after it's release. Candice Hilligoss' fine performance will overwhelm you as she portrays a character caught in a purgatory between life and death. Her beauty alone will strike the viewer in a way few actresses can. Her physical acting, facial gestures, and line delivery will leave you wondering why this woman did not become a household name like Marilyn Monroe or Raquel Welch.<br />The story is as simple as it is complex. A woman is an innocent passenger in a car that gets into a drag race with some teenage thugs. The result is her car going over a bridge into a fast running, sandy river. As she crawls out of the wreckage covered in mud, the viewer thinks she has survived, but has she?<br />Ms. Hilligoss' character is a musician, an organist to be exact who takes a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Utah. As she begins her journey she is terrified of images of a phantom of sorts who seems to be seeking her out. Anyone who has driven for an average of twelve hours straight can tell you that driving can take its toll, and the mind can play tricks on a sleepy driver. However, after she checks into her room, she finds the same phantom lurking in the window, then in the hallway. Who is this creature, what does he want, where is he from?<br />The main point of the film is not horror, but human nature. Are we all alone in this world? Is everyone an island unto themselves. The lesson is thrown upon our character by a minister, a psychologist, and a would be male suitor. They all try to help her in their own way (except the suitor who is only interested in her for a chance to have sex). But our character waves a hand at them all, convinced that she can do it her own way. She is an independent woman who needs no man or companionship; a view that may have gone against society's thinking in 1962.<br />The male suitor (or 'just your normal guy' as he likes to call himself) is an obnoxious oaf to say the least. His headstrong pursuit of her is only his own selfish desire to have her. He's not an alcoholic he claims, yet he drinks at dawn. He quit college because he doesn't like to learn. This is not an ideal resume for a long term relationship for her or any other woman. When she is truly frightened by the visiting spectre, and she reaches out to him as a last resort for help, he runs. Not wanting to get involved, he was only interested in her for her body and his own sexual desire. Yet another lesson in this film for all the young ladies who care to pay attention.<br />As the story goes on Candace's soul seems to deteriorate. She slips in and out of reality and a strange sort of parallel world. This dimension looks the same as real life, but she cannot be seen or heard. The department store dressing room for example, shows how the lost spirit must learn that she is no longer of this world, but now belongs in the spirit world, where yet another companion awaits her.<br />Who is this man that haunts her in visions? We see at the end of the film that they are to be together forever. In the final seen where we see Candace's peek at her after-life. She screams in horror as the ghosts dance eternally as the haunt the carnival. She is finally captured by the ghosts and is spirited away. The police and minister are confused and baffled as her footprints and final body print leads nowhere. The minister gives a knowing look as if he has known all along, but says nothing.<br />The minister must have known there was something wrong with his new organist when he first met and eventually fired her. She had not the soul of a musician, she only had a knowledge for music. She was told this too by the organ builder in the beginning of the film. When she is possessed in the church and her true musician ship comes out as she plays without control, that isher true spirit, but the misinster fires her for 'blasphony'.<br />This film cannot be watched once and dismissed. It deserves to be watched over and over again. It is a timeless movie where something seems new every time you watch it. I applaud you 'Carnival of Souls'. One of the greatest movies ever made.s her true spirit, but the misinster fires her for 'blasphony'.<br />This film cannot be watched once and dismissed.

0783225857|3|This is a great movie.  I feel a bit taken however, since the description of the disk lists it as \\"widescreen\\" 1.85:1.

B001NTWFXW|5|I'm a fledgling Bossa Nova fan. I bought this as my very first album after studying the reviews here on Amazon. Now that I've listened to it enough times I understand why it is such a seminal work--it seems to underpin so much of the music that came after it. Thanks to all the knowledgeable Bossa Nova reviewers out there, you didn't steer me wrong!
B00H6LS59E|4|This is a fun, fast-paced, delightful story of 5 children who suddenly discover they are not like everyone else.  They have superpowers, each with a different ability.  True, this is a reoccurring theme in a lot of Young Adult books, but it’s the characters and settings that set them apart.  And that’s what Jan Raymond did with her book.  Each child has his or her own voice and character tracts, all the way down to each family dynamic.<br /><br />Out of the 5 children, Maya and Ryan are the protectors of the group, and Sam, even though the youngest, is their leader. And you can’t help feeling sorry for Cassie as she takes last place, with her Mother, to her younger brother Sam.  The way her Mother treats her corresponds to how Cassie relates to her brother, Sam.  Then there’s Seb, the spoiled, rich kid, neglected and looking for acceptance.  The Circle of Five doesn’t always get along, as they learn to adjust to their powers and each other, but they back each other up, without question, when danger rears its ugly head.  I figured out the villain almost as soon as the character was introduced.  No surprise there, at least for me.  But then, this book was written for a younger reading level.<br /><br />Sam’s character keeps the reader wondering, are they following the right path with Mr. Harris?  What is his motive for helping and training them?  These questions don’t get answered in this book.<br /><br />Even though I immensely enjoyed the story, I was taken aback by the poor quality of the writing.  It’s written in a simplistic style, which was fine for me, but it’s all the needless empty filler words and redundancies which will lead to my lower rating.  The words “that”, “had” and “gotten” are used over and over.  An editor or a good editing program would’ve eliminated most of these.<br /><br />I do recommend this book and I give it 4 feathers.

B00JPUUSEE|3|The Big Chill is the very sentimental, very forced story of college friends who reunite after the tragic loss of one of their own. This premise is actually rather promising, bringing together very different individuals with a shared past into one space for the duration of the story.<br /><br />The film’s best moments come from this difficult friction; life’s circumstances has drifted these once-good friends apart so far, it is hard to understand why they were drawn together in the first place. Instead of exploring this underlying tragedy, though, The Big Chill takes the obtusely easy way out, and forces the friendships right back to where we were told they started.<br /><br />Everything about this film feels phony, from Kevin Klein as host ordering running shoes for all the house guests (a plot detail that doesn’t manifest into anything) to Glenn Close encouraging her own husband to impregnate a childless friend. The beloved 1960s Motown soundtrack plays a purely nostalgic, not a timely role; nothing about these characters implies they came of age during an era of such turmoil.<br /><br />It is truly mind-boggling to grasp why this film has been so lauded over the years. Perhaps, like the very characters of The Big Chill, we have developed a forced sense of nostalgia.

B00AYB0TOW|5|There is nothing original, or Judge dredd in this movie. the story line was stolen from both Escape from New York and die hard. I'm curious about who told the actor to use the batman voice and snake plissken attitude. It didn't work, although it was less amusing than the Stallone original voice. The Stallone version was large and enthralling. The latest version is contrived and overly in love with the slow motion violence that little gamer boys love. I'm curious as to why they didn't just hire Sydney the janitor to play Dredd. They could have covered him and had a voice over and gotten as good if not better performance. the actor was never seen, (unlike the little girl who was the focus of the movie)and he was simply used as an accessory, like a purse. Non of the Judge Dred storyline was used and the film had none of the massive reality of the cursed earth and why these people were herded into this city. It was just intended to be a two advertisment for a video game and it failed badly. Weak writing, incredibly weak directing and wasted acting talent. It cost $190 million and made $37 million world wide. It could have been so great with the addition of talent on the writing and directorial end, but then they possibly couldn't have used that cute little blonde girl, which I suspect was the real point of the movie making process.<br /><br />p.s.<br />At least they worked on the costuming. The cod piece was left out and the bright 90's colors. Too bad they didn't use the costumes and steal the story from Judge Dredd. That would have been a good movie.

B0002KVULG|5|I was in the audience to watch the stage & film versions of Dracula, Frank Langella has duplicated his role on film, there was nothing that can tell you how appealing to the audienece this role was played, and to signify this, was to watch the Ladies in the audience litterally pull down their collars and show their want for Dracula to bite them. His elegant moves upon the stage and his eyes, voice and mannerism gave Dracula a New Look a Much Better look to the audience. There was no fear in the audience, but a want for more from a great actor such as Frank langella as only he could play Dracula as it should be played.
B00004Y6NP|5|Let me start off by saying that there is not a bad song on this CD.  The first four songs are some of Dire Straits most popular and for good reason.  When you put this album on there is absolutely no reason you would need to skip any of the songs in the beginning.  Unlike some albums where there is a less than superb song in the middle of a great run this album is simply perfect.<BR>     Now we move on to the second half of this album, a lesser known half.  So maybe you don't know many of the songs on the second half.  All i have to say to you is \\"Why worry?\\"  There truly is no need to worry, Dire Straits will come through.  I will agree that songs like \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" and \\"Ride Across the River\\" are not as good as some of the other songs on this album, but you can't say that they are bad.<BR>     Not only are the songs on this CD wonderful but the order in which the band put them on the CD is also very well thought-out.  The CD starts off with a Bang with 4 of the band's top 5 songs.  The only song missing in this is, of course, Sultans of Swing.  But what do you think would happen if Sultans of Swing was on this album?  The album would then be TOO good.  God only knows what would happen if an album THAT good was made.  Then after taking you through some of the lesser known songs the CD finishes with title track, Brothers in Arms.  Brothers in Arms is just another of many many great songs on this CD.<BR>     You cannot go wrong in purchasing this album.  There is just too many good songs and 0 bad songs, what have you got to lose?<br />Oookkkkkk....So what i really meant to say was : YOUR LATEST TRICK.  Your.  Latest.   Trick.   it's over and done with.  If you know anything about that you know that that's all you need to know.

0143038583|5|This is a very worthwhile book. A lot of it is not new to those of us who think about food and its relationship to the world.  But it is well told and full of insight that enriches that thinking and examples and metaphors that flesh it out.  For example do you know how many calories, of fossil fuel energy it takes to produce a calorie of corn energy under our industrial agriculture system? I forget, but its in the book and its a depressing number, especially considering that the actual calorie of corn energy was a free gift from the sun and the corn plant.  If you don't have some idea of the unsustainable fuel guzzling industrial food chain, then this book will be a revelation to you.    However, the book is more than just anti-industrial food.  In fact, I don't know that it is anti-anything.  It just describes and meditates on these things. It does not solve any problems.  You come away with a deeper understanding of the world as it is and our place in it as big smart omnivorous animals.  Like all the rest of the animals we came up through evoltionary history on the abundant free lunch that the sun supplied and that plants made available directly to us and through food animals that also ate plants.  Now we find ourselves dependent on an industrial food chain based on productivity cranked through the roof by petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides.  And that is a real bargain with the devil.  Humanity's numbers may have already grown to the point that we are addicted to that food chain as moral creatures in that to abandon it would be let certain populations starve to death.  At the same time, there are alternatives that offer some hope, or at least offer individuals healthy, flavorful food with integrity.  One can even still hunt and gather one's food in a way that pay's tribute to the ten or 20 thousand generations that lived this way.  The books last chapters conclude by capturing some of the inherent joy and satisfaction of hunting and gathering and preparingand consuming our food.  That satisfaction is the joy of participating in the world, because, as the last line of the book says: \\"...we eat by the grace of nature, not industry, and what we're eating is never anything more or less than the body of the world.\\"  I could not have said it better.  I can't wait to read Botany of Desire.

0307476073|5|Cheryl Nyland was crippled by grief when her mother died at the tender young age of 45. Barely a woman herself, Cheryl had no clue how to go on with her life without her rock, the one person who had taken care of her during all the tough times they’d encountered. Without her mother around to bond them together, Cheryl’s relationship with her family—her brother, sister, and stepfather—disintegrated. She singlehandedly destroyed her marriage with a series of one-night flings with random men who meant nothing to her. When the meaningless sex no longer comforted her, she turned to Heroin in an effort to ease her pain. Four years after her mother died, desperate to save herself from her own self-destruction, Cheryl quit her job, sold all her belongings, and began an eleven hundred mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.<br /><br />When Cheryl divorced her first husband, Paul, the state of Minnesota gave her the option of choosing the surname she would use going forward. Instead of returning to her maiden name, she created a new name for herself, a new identify for her new life. She felt the word “strayed” defined her lifestyle. Not only did she consider herself a stray, a homeless waif, she also had strayed from her journey in life.<br /><br />Cheryl was totally unprepared to hike eleven hundred miles on the PCT. She bought plenty of gear, so much that she couldn’t lift her backpack, but she did absolutely nothing to get into shape physically. Despite her aching muscles, the blisters on her body, and her toenails that turn black and fell off from wearing too-small boots, she never gave up. She hiked through rain, snow, and scorching summer temperatures, making friends with all sorts of interesting people along the way. At times she only had pennies to her name, not even enough money to buy a bottle of Snapple Lemonade, the thing she craved the most while she was on the trail. A group of men, the three young bucks as they were known on the trail, dubbed Cheryl the Queen of the PCT, because people were always offering her free meals and places to shower and camp along the way.<br /><br />From the start, Cheryl was never afraid to be alone. In some ways, her journey reminds me of a wilderness programs for troubled youth. With her life stripped of all modern conveniences, Cheryl was forced to live off the land with only the bare necessities to survive.<br /><br />I admire the courage it took for Cheryl to go it alone on the PCT, but mostly I admire the courage it took for her to be so brutally honest in writing about the darkest years of her life.the Queen of the PCT, because people were always offering her free meals and places to shower and camp along the way.<br /><br />From the start, Cheryl was never afraid to be alone.

I'm huge fan of everything Ash and his team are doing and find myself referencing Running Lean principles often and going back to reread different sections all the time.  Really indispensable.  Thank you Ash.
B007JM4CWY|5|This game is awesome. I only wish there were save points while working on the puzzles. 1 slip of the finger and your not sure what was damaged. Over all I loved it and look forward to more.
B0026OR1UK|5|The talent code explains how we learn and what practices and procedures are employed by those who excel above and beyond the norm.  It also discusses why there are clusters of talent such as a hugely disproportionate number of major league baseball players coming from the Dominican Republic.  Based on scientific facts, it is nevertheless an easy read and easily understood.  Excellent for students or anyone else who wants to learn or master a specific talent.
B002ZG98Z0|4|I didn't know there was a Sex and the City 2 till one day I was shopping at Costco and saw it. I really enjoyed Sex and the City Movie so I was pretty excited to order Sex and the City two. I just finished watching the movie and I'm not as happy with it as I was with the first movie, but it wasn't bad.
B0015DYIH2|5|Love this book. Love the series. Not a book I recommend for young readers though. Ages 18 and older recommended
2352500796|5|It is a complete book covering everything. I have used it numerous times at gun shows to verify originality. Easy read lots of pictures.
B0031YJFCQ|5|Rarely will you find a book where the second or third book is better than the first.  This series definitely gets better the more you read!  :)
0062287338|4|This book was a great book until the end when the main character died(tris).<br />I chose this rating because of the ending.<br />all in all a great series and highly recommend book.
B00005JMD3|2|No, it's not very good but what can be expected of a show based on a dullish 70s (short lived) TV show? There wasn't too much material there to begin with. At least it wasn't based on a Disneyworld Theme Ride.<br />It begins with a little promise of some real story about SWAT sniper Jim Street (up and coming Irish hottie Colin Farrell, who does an utterly convincing American accent) who has both career and girl friend troubles. Street's lifestyle, apartment etc., are presented realistic for a change -- he's not a fantasy cop living in a condo overlooking the ocean -- and the early action and training scenes when he gets back into SWAT are convincing. <br />It goes downhill in the 2nd half with an absurd \\"caper\\" involving a French billionaire drug dealer who offers ONE HUNDRED MEEELYYYION DOLLARS if some thug will bust him out of prison. Oliver Martinex, marginally convincing in last year's \\"Unfaithful\\" is utterly ridiculous in this role, although he didn't have a chance since the part is written absurdly. He too young, slightly built and \\"fashion model-ish\\" to be menacing, plus how scary are the FRENCH anyhow?<br />Samuel L. Jackson and Michelle Rodriguez are wasted in this. Jackson reprises his unexceptional role in \\"The Negotiator\\", to no great effect, and Rodriguez -- the rare actress who can believably come across as physically tough -- is just a PC addition to the rainbow coalition cast. She is given literally NOTHING to do, not even fire her weapon. There is a vague suggestion that she and Farrell's character will or have hooked up romantically, but something was left on the cutting room floor and this plotline isn't developed. The filmakers clearly haven't got a clue what to do with a female SWAT officer.<br />The rest of the cast are treated with such indifference, they barely register. Soundtrack is annoying and extremely LOUD, apparently designed for a urban audience close to deafness from listening to very loud boomboxes. This is a hugely irritating trendin action movies lately and is totally out of control.<br />SWAT units are an interesting part of the police force, and it's too bad that an ORIGINAL (non 70s TV series) script could not have been developed, especially one focusing on female officers in a male dominated arena. This movie lets down in virtually all aspects. Just a by the book, loud action flick with no character development and relying on noisy violence instead of the precision and cleverness one would normally associate with SWAT. Only worth renting for the testostorone impaired.
B002WY65W4|5|This is one of 5 movies that I absolutely love and will watch once or twice a year.<br />Twinkies, Zombies and Bill Murray cameo, it doesn't get bett than that
B004JN1D2I|5|The books are fantastic and the Kindle version (mine is on the Mac) is perfect.  Only con is that there isn't a 5th book, yet.
B00AE5R2NO|5|Everyone wants $45 for this toy or more because it is so hard to get. They must have released it a while ago before Octonauts was big in the USA and then stopped producing them. Normally this toy is $19.99 but I had to have it for my daughter because it was the only one we were missing. Its going to be her favorite. Is just as described and came new in the box. Also shipping stated it was going to take almost two months to get to us and it took about 2/3 weeks. We love it  =)
B00CWY76CC|5|It started out easy and gets more difficult. It's a fun and challenging game. Great for killing some time.  :)
B004O3YGMC|3|Works great on local network but i cannot connect using 4G. I can find my computer but cannot connect. (Bionic)
B00BEIYP1W|3|Good story as a follow up to the F1 documentary.  Ron Howard did some good stuff here.
B004SJ3BCI|5|Angry Birds! I love it. There's perfect levels and it hasn't crashed yet. The birds are better than ever on this one. Pick it up. The ads dont even bother me.
B00J3AW23G|5|There seems to be some very good graphics the music could get annoying but that is what the volume button is for. It is a good game.<br />Kitsu_ne@yahoo
B0050DIWFC|5|What a surprise ending.  Loved it and would recommend to everyone.  You think you know what's going to happen<br />but you don't.  Couldn't put this one down.
B000005HN6|5|When I first heard Opeth, I was mystified. The single, clear thought that swam through my head was, &quot;What the--!?&quot; &quot;In the Mist She was Standing,&quot; the first track on the debut Orchid, explains my reaction. Glorious but heavy guitars (care of Mikael Akerfeldt and Peter Lindgren), a deft &amp; tuneful bass accompaniment (Johan de Farfalla), the complex drumming (Anders Nordin), and the fierce growls and enigmatic poetry (again, Akerfeldt) makes it all seem like ordinary death/black metal. Strikingly melodic, yes. Intense, definitely. Poetic, of course. But otherwise conventional.<br />But listen more. The song is 13-minutes long. The band's apparent demeanor changes moods on a dime by dropping the heaviness for beautiful acoustic passages and softly sung vocal sections (this is done often). It's consistently very melodic. The lyrics are dark and romantic, not violent or Satanic. There's also the cover, with its nice pink flower. Quite a contrast from the blood-splattered, diabolic art of many bands in the metal section, eh? &quot;What the--!?&quot;<br />Few debut albums are written and recorded with such maturity and sophistication that they sound years beyond the incipient factors normally ascribed to a band's first release. Orchid is by far one of the most astonishing debut albums I've ever heard. The finesse and tightness embodying the band's progressive music this early in their careers is just unbelievable. I would have never guessed it was a debut if I hadn't known beforehand. I can't name many bands whose debut is this interesting...and even fewer whose debut is so original. The band has grown, obviously (their 2001 release Blackwater Park exemplifies their progress over the years), but this is still an astonishing release. Remember, it's a debut!<br />I don't think anyone can call this death metal or black metal. It's metal, yep, but otherwise it's impossible to pigeonhole. I agree with another reviewer that it is &quot;Opeth Metal.&quot; The music is heavy, but melodic. It is never brutal or abrasive like, say, Cannibal Corpse (which I hate and it makes me nauseous). There are no blastbeats, no Satanic lyrics about eating babies (yes, I'm stereotyping). This is just good, melodic progressive metal -- twin guitar harmonies, heavy riffs, reams of acoustic passages, and a blend of death/black vox and low, chilling clean vox. At this stage in their careers, Opeth's songwriting style is fairly unique. Their approach makes the beginning and end of each song almost arbitrary. Since each Opeth song is a sequence of musical &quot;scenes,&quot; the album could almost pass as one full song. Usually I would criticize a band for this lack of structure, but Opeth never loses my interest. I guess they must be doing something right. They've got a very different &amp; good thing going on here. (Starting on Still Life, their fourth album, they would start to introduce conventional things like &quot;choruses&quot; [what? choruses?] into their songs.) However, if any debut characteristic is to be found, it's the production. It's still pretty good, but sometimes the soft vocals are too quiet and the bass isn't as rumbling. But that's the only complaint I have...not bad for a first album.<br />It's hard to discuss individual songs because there aren't really any that stick out more than others, and they are all pretty similar. Well, &quot;Silhouette&quot; is different...just a short piano piece. Everything else (except the interlude &quot;Requiem&quot;) is pretty long, usually around the 10-minute mark, full of the band's characteristic diversity -- the acoustic sections, the heavy parts, the eclectic vocals....and the absolute beauty of it all. The lyrics are usually abstract musings on love. Combined with the music, they are romantic and often sad. The music often has a medieval touch influencing the melodies.<br />Look, I'll level with you here. I'm trying to make this album sound good so you buy it. It's truly incredible, but heck if I can eloquently convey this band's supreme greatness. It's impossible to dissect the goodness of Opeth's debut and articulate it. The best reviews for this album are those that express enthusiasm for the music without explaining all the songs. I don't do that too well...but it feels right to add my voice to the chorus of acclaim this band is getting.<br />Listening to Opeth is like falling in love with a woman who is beautiful in both body and mind. You are drawn to her exquisite appearance, but it takes time to really gain a full appreciation for the depth of her character. Over time, love grows, and the relationship gets more rewarding. Opeth is like that...it starts good, and gets much better over time. This is not a band that you listen to for a while then forget...it is an enduring experience, and a promise of reward. Listening to Orchid and enjoying it is like a gift that offers ineffable delight.<br />The true spirit of great music is here.ible, but heck if I can eloquently convey this band's supreme greatness.

B0052RDHTM|5|Pretty much addicted to Ken Follett's writing. Really like how these books tie-in with history. This is a great read and as usual, he shows his incredible talent making you feel like you were there. My favorite Ken Follett trilogy begins with Pillars of the Earth, but Fall of Giants is an easy recommend. You won't be disappointed.
B0094M2ITG|4|Started out slow but turned out to be a good movie.
B004YEJGEO|5|This game is quick to learn, but takes time and patience to master. Game had tons of stages. It is lots of fun!
B00EPFEY44|5|This CD/DVD will transport you to Portofino, Italy.  It's fantastic!  If you have never listening to him before, now it the time.
B00063F8B2|5|The soundtrack from this film is a winner.  From Kate Smith to Bing Crosby plus Steven Tyler and Josh Groban?  This music will put you in the mood for Christmas!
B004SBX112|4|HOWEVER! It doesn't not update your old installation (ad version) of the game, it installs a new copy of the game.  If you're rooted you can copy and paste your scores/saves from the ad version to the ad-free version then delete the ad version.  I gave it 4-stars b/c the ad-free app should update the ad-version like the original copy of Angry Birds.  Users who aren't root will have to start all over as their info will not carry over from the ad-version to the ad-free version.  Glad to be playing Angry Birds without ads, but I shouldn't have needed to copy my save files to make it work.
B00B2V66VS|2|I appreciate the fact that Imangi Studios is trying to make a knew temple run and I guess that's okay. But here's the thing. Temple run is better than temple run two. I want the old temple run back and whenever I try to get on it says &quot;force close app isn't responding.&quot;  That's not cool guys. I want to play the origanal. Not this new crape. So you can get this app if you want but it will never be as good as the first and now I cant play my favorite game just beacause the company wants more money...?
B00BATG18K|1|So disappointing, I am a fan of Amy Tan writing but I can't believe she actually wrote this one nor that the publisher actually sent it  out. Sorry about the one star but this reads like a first effort and not a good one at that.The story is an old one and much better told by other writers. Can't recommend this one and sorry I wasted my time and money.one star for managing to get the publisher to buy it.
B000HSKUBE|5|Ian Richardson is superb in this highly entertaining drama.  He doesn't chew up the scenery, and the story is captivating.  There's a &#34;Macbeth&#34; feel to the whole thing, lacking in the American new version, which is also superb in its own way.  Intelligent, adult drama at its best!
B007IXWKUK|4|The whole rumor of this &#34;sealing the deal&#34; didn't really work. Other than that she said it was a good book. Fellas it depend on you woman.
B004XJRQUQ|5|Great product and quick delivery
B002ZM74Y6|5|I love Ray Liotta for me this is his best movie role. & Mr. De Niro  & Joe Pesci are a classic in this movie. You can't go wrong with this movie: The best!
B000XUBFE2|5|A book that keeps you up all night.  I loved this to the very end.  I read this first then watched the movie.
B003QSOE0U|5|Incredibly powerful.
B00BEZTMFY|5|I guess I've become a Hobbit fan.  Great movie. Saw part two in the theatre last week.  Hated the cliffhanger they left me with.
B00C5XBAOA|5|I love Sofia! Aaaaand so does my daughter, which is why I bought her this. The funniest thing was while I was looking up my orders on Amazon, she saw this and started hollering, &#34;Mom! I want that!!!!! Get it for me!!!&#34; (a bit spoiled, yes.) Good sized dolls, and they look wonderful.

B000005AYM|5|Odd as it sounds, I really enjoy listening to this album when I'm sleepy. It lets me relax and eventually fall dead asleep.  The rhythm and music is just so soothing and relaxing.  This definatly isn't driving music if that's what you're looking for.  Though some of the songs on this album sound the same, I give Erykah Badu credit because she was truley an influence in modern day r&amp;b and soul, thus paving the way for such artists as Angie Stone and Macy Gray.  She is definatly an interesting figure in the music industry, known for her body jewlery and hair raps (I remember hearing Billy Crystal commenting at the Academy Awards on her infamous hair wrap: &quot;They finally found the last missing Oscar.  It was found under Erykah Badu's wrap.&quot; LOL)  Hit songs include &quot;On &amp; On&quot;, &quot;Appletree&quot; and one of my favorites, &quot;Certainly.&quot; Another song I also enjoy is the catchy, &quot;4 Leaf Clover&quot; as well as the &quot;Intro&quot; and &quot;Outro.&quot;  &quot;Next Lifetime&quot; I also remember hearing on the radio and is catchy as well.  So, if you're interested in modern Soul/R&amp;B that you can relax to (Whether it be at dinner or going to bed) this CD is reccomended.
0143038419|5|Most readers will be well rewarded if they hang in through the initial whining.  The author embarks on a true journey of self discovery.  She is witty, insightful and she delivers with a first-class prose style.  Is she narcissistic?  Definately, but so what?  She eventually gets around to helping someone besides herself.  There is much to be gleaned from joining her in her travels.  Enjoy!
B002Q1YDLI|4|The author did a good job with the second part of the story. As always, she is very detailed in her story.
B001SN78JO|4|\\"Yes Man\\" is a movie in which Jim Carrey goes back to his roots of comedy.  Although the movie never truly made me laugh out loud consistantly like \\"Ace Venture\\" or \\"Liar, Liar\\" I still found the movie to be funny.  I think it hit the spot for comedy movies and I will watch it over and over again for its entertainment value.      What I liked most of the movie is Zoe Deschanel. Yet again she made the character her own. Giving a quarkiness to her character in \\"Yes Man\\", as she usually does; which is a major part of her charm.     The supporting actors do a solid job, although none do an excellent job.  But they all add to the movie as a whole.      Storyline wise the movie was your prototypical Jim Carrey comedy movie.  So if you like Jim Carrey Humor you will most definately like this movie.      Overall, I enjoy my exprience with this movie and I recomend it to all those Jim Carrey Fans out there!
B00DR0PDNE|4|This is a fairly nice device, but it hasn't quite grown to be as useful as I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />I think partly its google's fault for not doing more, but also because a bunch of the other major guys decided to make their own instead of just adopting a standard.<br /><br />In general, this would be a MUCH more useful device if it would have been a pass-through switch instead of a separate device.<br />If you could just start it, or maybe even have it do its own picture in picture, I think it would have been a much more used device.  As is, I usually forget I have it.<br /><br />A bonus though:  the deals you can get through it has made it a pretty good deal, even if it didn't get as much use as I had hoped.
B002NN5F7A|5|Although you always know you are watching a film of a play and not a piece of cinema, it is very well done. The acting by all the principals is terrific, which helps to keep the viewer engaged throughout, and the play itself, with its insights into self interest, self promotion, and self deception, is great. Well worth seeing.
B00Y6QF0PE|3|I read EL James's Fifty Shades of trilogy in last than two weeks before I saw the film. I can see why readers/watchers are intrigued with this story. I paraphrase James in an interview for the movie, her story is a fairy tale with a kinky twist.  The main reason I kept reading Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freedom is because of Christian Grey. For me, dark characters are intriguing due to their motivations and their psyche. I wanted to further know why Christian felt like he had to become a Dominant and his need for control.  I was quite excited when news reported that a new EL James novel would debut. I was interested in how James would portray Christian's character from his point of view. I am always interested in, not only in writers writing a good story, but how writers write a good story.  The first 3/4 of the book are not good due to the type of language James uses in regards of having Christian tell his story. Stylistically, Christian's point of view reminded me of Ana's first point of view. The way James uses language doesn't support Christian's characteristics. The way James characterizes Christian in his first point of view makes him a very weak character. What was missing for me is a fine balance of James trying to show Christian being the Master of his Universe and his vulnerability, hurt, and anger in what his mother did. What crippled 3/4 of the novel is having him behave like a love struck fool and adolescent. The combination is brutal on someone who is supposed to have it somewhat together.  Christian also uses the same words as Ana's does in the first book. &#34;Heady,&#34; comes to mind. As a writer myself, when you develop characters, they must have their own language...and it must be own in the book. Christian's language was not own, and the type of language James uses to characterize him, it actually puts the character off. James does too much of Christian behaving like an adolescent, teenage, childish, and childlike character that she doesn't write it in a dignified manner.Bottom line, the juvenile, immature way she characterizes Christian made him come off as a creepy sociopath instead of someone in agonizing anguish about what haunts him.   The only part of the book that rises to any surface of the water is the last 1/4 of the book where you see Christian really having an issue with what he has done. Then, I saw some maturity. However, I wished that more of the language matched with how he was characterized. The lack of how she uses language to characterize the protagonist weakens his overall image from prior three books. It is sad that through Ana's eyes, I saw Christian as a stronger character than in the way James exposes him in Grey.
015206396X|4|I first became interested in Graceling after reading a review at The Book Nest. I'm glad I followed her recommendation, because pretty much from the first page I was hooked. This is the perfect summer read for either laying by the pool or relaxing beneath a shady tree.    Our heroine, Katsa, is blessed, or cursed at times in her opinion, with a grace. In Katsa's world, a grace is a sort of innate ability that certain people are born with. Graces can be as simple as being able to play the flute really well, or as powerful as being able to read minds. Katsa's grace just happens to be killing, and as such, is exploited by her Uncle, the king, to preserve his own power and ensure that his demands are met. Katsa's role as royal enforcer often leaves her troubled, and somewhat afraid of her own powers. Deep down, Katsa is also lonely, although she doesn't realize it. That is, until she meets Po, a prince with a powerful fighting grace that seems to rival her own. As Katsa learns more about Po, and his mysterious grace, she also learns more about herself and finds the freedom to choose her own path.    This book was pure fun. The story had plenty of action, beginning even from the first page, and I found Katsa to be a complex but likeable character. The romance was sweet, without being overly sappy, although I did find Katsa's negative views of marriage as somewhat puzzling. This may sound strange, but I also really enjoyed the antagonist in the novel. We don't actually see much of his character, but his grace was just so sneaky! Cashore kept me guessing to the end as to how or if he would be ultimately defeated. I am glad that I gave this book a try and I plan on reading Fire, Cashore's soon to be released second novel.
B000RZIGVS|2|Just got this set a few days ago and man is this thing cheaply made.  I'm not sure who approved the design of this box but it is extremely low quality. Each green plastic tray contains 2 dvds and all the trays are held together with just 2 strips of packing tape!!! The tray itself is brittle and when i received it many of they had chipped pieces of broken plastic lodged at the bottom of the box.  Some of these pieces were actually lodged between the dvd and the tray thereby damaging the discs....     Many of the discs them selves were severely scratched because of the poor construction of the trays and I would estimate that no less than 70% of all the disc had moderate to heavy scratches on them. Also the discs themselves were of poor quality as there was protruding plastic nubs on the side of many discs where i guess they were left from when the disc was being molded.  I had to physically file down at least 4 discs to avoid damaging my dvd player.      It short this is a overpriced box set that is definitely not worth the money. If your a collector just spend some extra bucks and get a better set.
0439023483|5|I bought this book yesterday and started reading it at 8pm. I was transfixed. I continued to read until 12am at which point I decided that I was in for the long-haul. I finished it at 2am. The first thing I did this morning was make a run for the bookstore.<br />My point is: this book is so freaking good that I couldn't put it down. The main character is likeable, fully-developed, and kick-ass. The supporting characters are also captivating. The story of the survivor-like \\"hunger games\\" is mesmerizing and facinating. Part love story, part sci-fi, part man v man adventure.<br />All I have to say is, if you buy Hunger Games, go ahead and buy the other two books as well--you're not going to want to let Katniss go after the first one and you don't want to have to wait for another order.
B00AZRBLHO|4|This novel is one of the better referenced works I've read which explains DevOps and the concepts behind making it work in a down-to-earth way.  The author also engages the reader in a game to reach the conclusion.  Recommended.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Awesome book couldn't put it down!
B00AREIAI8|4|A great app and game I believe people should try it because you don't know what your missing until you try it for the first time
B00GY0HJ4K|5|I really enjoy playing this game.  It is an addictive game.  It is great for children to play. Well worth the download.
B00FAPF5U0|1|I think the game would be worth more, but to throw in a cost is brilliant for the developers only.  I prefer to buy a game and know that what I paid is the only expense I have.  I think I'll stick to Bejeweled which is strikingly similar.
B00KIGRRRU|3|Uneven pacing
B002MQYOFW|5|Katniss seems so real to me, as well as all the other characters, witch i love. The romance is sizzling and crackling and i can only hope katniss ends up with peeta. On to catching fire!! :)
0671701800|5|It is not simply about science: it's about personal achievement, polotics, religion and human relations, about a dream you have for your life and pursue until you get it.<br /><br />This was the first sci-fi book most of my friends read and they simply loved it. You can't stop reading..
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Great Grisham novel. Lots of twists and turns with great ending. Kept picturing Jake Brigance as Matthew McCaughnehay. Several subplots and just a general good read.
B0009KA7BS|1|Really bad horror movie that has only the great performance of Rachel Weisz from keeping it from being a total waste of time. Keanu is miscast to the point of him hurting the film and the script is so horribly written that it literally almost too painful to the ears.    Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only good thing about the entire film.
B0099Y2MYK|5|I loved this series since the first season, so now have all three so I can watch it over again.  I received it right away, thanks to Discover, and in perfect condition.  Could not have been more plesase with the product or the service.
B0000VCZK2|5|The Alien Quadrilogy is absolutely the best science fiction quadrilogy of all time. The combined set covers every aspect of a superb sci fi that one would expect--science fiction based on existing and projected sci fi realities about space travel, space ship design, space travel, future technology, the intrigue and mystery of unknown planets and other life forms, some horror, excellent drama, and a well edited film, with superior directing and superior acting. The set includes not four, but nine DVD's, four of which cover two versions of the movies--original and director's cut; and the other five covering the making of the movies, including interviews with the actors--sometimes a few humorous and enlightening moments during the filming. This quadrilogy is a classic, and can serve as a science fiction course on the college level.
B007IXWKUK|5|I completely enjoyed this book. It focuses more on the people than the sex but it's still mesmerizing none the less.
B001O3B2M2|5|Love this Album so many good songs some of them were underrated but very good songs gotta say buy it and love it!
B009YP9L7U|3|Cute but predictable love affair, easy read but no suprises you can see every step of the book comming.  It's about a couple who both decide to remain single despite help from friends, they meet marry fall in love split up realise their love and start again.
0307716988|5|Even if I am not a die heart Michael Jackson fan, I will still love reading this book.  I got the book in April 2011 and finished reading it the first time in May 2011.  It took me that long because I live a very busy life with 2 jobs and busy travelling schedules.  To me, fining the time to read the book is tough.  I think everyone, including those who are not Michael Jackson fans, will love reading this book and will be fascinated by Michael Jackson's autobiography that openly and honestly tells the world everything about how he was brought up, how Jackson 5 and he rose to fame, how he became the most popular and most accomplished entertainer.  I really wish Michael Jackson has continued to write about himself after finishing this book in 1988 to dispute all those so-call biographies that, in fact, were written with bias and opinionated judgment
B00T3DNKIE|2|Terms I'd apply to this book are muddled, lumpy, and meandering.  It certainly wasn't a compelling read and in fact, I struggled to finish it.  The childhood reminisces were interesting but towards the end, far too many lectures that might have been deemed insightful during the civil rights era but not so much in 2015.  Ultimately, the &#34;watchman&#34; is all about Scout developing her own conscience and values apart from her father's.  I'm sure glad I downloaded this as a Kindle through my library as opposed to purchasing it.
B004XJRQUQ|5|I saw the first two movies, but with the way Catching Fire ended I couldn't wait for the third movie, so, I bought the trilogy.  While on the first book, I wondered why I didn't get the books to begin with, OMG...the movies were great but the books...I actually reread it shortly after having read it already. I thought if a technology existed where a book can be turned into a movie verbatim, for lack of a better expression, that movie would be AMAZING!!!

0547572298|5|Science fiction writer Philip K. Dick has imagined a world of the future in which those who die, if they are frozen quickly after death, can be kept in \\"half-life\\" for a period of time and can communicate with loved ones through the use of a \\"protophason amplifier.\\" In this future, some people have developed strong psychic powers, many working for a company that specializes in sending psychics into businesses to be spies. To protect businesses by counteracting the psychics, \\"prudence organizations\\" employ people who can sense psychic activity and ferret out the snoopers.<br /><br />Thus enters Glen Runciter, owner of the foremost prudence organization; his wife Ella, who is in half-life; and Joe Chip, his second-in-command. The company receives a big job on Luna, taking 11 psychic-sensors along, only to be caught in an ambush staged by its psychic competitors. And Glen Runciter is killed, or is he? Everyone else lives and escape back to earth, but then time begins to shift for the 11 survivors, sometimes with disastrous results. And they keep receiving cryptic messages from their dead boss, sometimes written on bathroom walls. Just what is going on here?<br /><br />This is not your standard sci-fi novel, needless to say. \\"Ubik\\" is short for \\"ubiquitous\\"--existing or being everywhere at the same time. In the novel it is a product which can be used for almost anything, including an aerosol spray that can halt the killing effects of time-shift. Questions are raised here about the nature of reality and belief, and the reader thinks he has received the answer to the puzzle, until the last chapter. Then, oops, maybe all that was the wrong answer.<br /><br />Science fiction is often dismissed when critics are choosing \\"great\\" novels, probably because it tends to be formulaic. Even though his chosen genre was science fiction, Phillip K. Dick didn't always follow the rules. This novel is funny; it gives you some philosophical matters to think about; it keeps you riveted to find out what happens next; its main character is engaging. It is well worth your time even if you are not a sci-fi fan. Highly recommended.
B00AEJM6H2|5|I LOVE THAT GAME
B00B4VI8MQ|5|I think it was a very good game. the lady that did the dialog spoke in edible words that you could under stand. the find the object was hard.
B000088E6D|5|Michael Bubl has arrived!! What a treat to hear such an array of beautiful songs, sung by such a delicious voice. This album is fresh and alive - what a combination - the smoothest, richest vocals I've ever heard and absolutely gorgeous arrangements!! <BR>I say TEN STARS !
B006X415GK|5|Love the doll. Box was a little dinged up but I'm still happy. I purchased the doll as a collectors item so the damage to the box was a little disappointing, however, the doll seems to be in perfect condition and there is no sign that the box has been opened or that the doll has been removed. I wish there was a .5 rating system because it wasn't a perfect five stars but I don't think four fits either.
0553801473|4|Great story, but I am ready for resolution!  What will happen to my favorite characters (Tyrion, Jon Snow, Arya, Samwell, Theon, Brienne and Jaime ?  That being said, I'll continue to read his novels till either they or I run out of steam.
B000GCFO0I|5|I must admit that I have never played SILENT HILL, the game. Consequently, I was completely mind-f'ed by the gloriously gruesome visuals and über-nightmarish set pieces. I had to watch it a second time in order to pay closer attention to the actual storyline. I consider this movie to be like a much  darker (considering what is required of anyone wanting to enter SILENT HILL in the first place), more adult version of LABYRINTH. Rose (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) loses her daughter in the ghostly town of the title, and must go on a life threatening / mind altering adventure through its many mouldering halls and alleys. Along the way, Rose is joined by officer Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden from The Mist and TV's X-Files), who is drawn into the same hideous encounters w/ the various demonic denizens of this hellish place. Together, they must not only face legions of demons, but also a crazed religious cult led by Kristabella (Alice Kriege from Ghost Story, Star Trek: First Contact, and Sleepwalkers), who is Jim Jones in a woman's skin. Rose and Cybil find themselves in the middle of a war between two dark forces bent on destroying each other. The monsters are memorable, especially the main demon (w/ his gigantic cheese-grater helmet and telephone pole sized butcher's knife!!), and those murderous, knife-wielding nurses! Highly recommended...
B00KWVZ750|5|I like this app it's worth downloading its the game i played most
B00AIUUXHC|4|Amazing game for anyone that likes shark games, but it won't stop freezing up and I don't know what to do about it. Overall this is a great game.
B0055SWM08|5|First time in quite awhile that Amazon has given us a really good free game. I may have gotten it for free, but I'd say it is easily worth its $0.99 price.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Good game!

B00CNQ7HAU|5|Fast moving, lots of storytelling and bouncing around, but the circle is closed at the end!  Add this to your summer reading!
B000063V8R|5|I have read review after review that has praised the third season of TNG and I absolutely agree with them.  I have always thought that TNG is by far the better Star Trek series compared with, say the new Enterprise series and I'm sorry but that theme tune does not cut it.  It is one typical aspect of that series which comes across as obvious back slapping on the part of America (sorry but true) as opposed to TNG that has none of this as I'm sure Gene wanted and is all the better for it.  That said, all the scripts are improved as a result of writer reorganisation at the time and it shows.  <br />As a series this ranks as the best along with Season 5 but as a DVD set I have my misgivings.  As one other review noted unlike say, X-Files, there are no commentaries of any kind, no deleted scenes or even bloopers.  (I have heard that there are reels archived away) therefore like the other sets they are let down by this.  That said this is still worth owning as Paramount won't be re-releasing these sets with all new extras any time soon (or at least they better not).<br />Everyone has given an episode by episode account of the series but all I feel inclined to say is this: Borg.  There are no obvious let downs in the season but then I never felt that let down by the first seasons when I first saw them.  The difference with the third season is it stands up to the test of time.<br />Amazon offer the best price on this set that I have come across and aside from the little nit picking relating to the features is a fine set.
B008LV8TSU|5|Loved it
0385504209|5|Loved it from beginning to end. One of the best books I've read in years! Now I've got to go back and read Dan Brown's earlier works, too.
B0054JZC6E|5|A lot more than I expected for free. There is a game for everyone. The games are fun and challenging. Its easy to earn coins to unlock games as you go. My kids enjoy the games as well. This is one of the best game apps runs perfectly on Kindle fire HD.
B008DW6VOQ|1|Kindle needs Yahoo Finance.<br /><br />Hated lack of options. The black background sucks. Graphically poor you'd thinks something on the Kindle HDX would look better.<br /><br />Doesn't show Nasdaq movers or most active stocks. Something about about a contract issue?
B0030MM68O|3|I don't know what everyone saw in this movie.<br />To me, the story was dull and the actors were just muddling along through their parts.<br />Seems to me that Renner's character acting the way he was, would have been pulled from duty. I understand the point of the movie was to see the toll war has on people, esp ones in dangerous situations day in and day out. But I wouldn't want someone this reckless protecting me. Maybe I'm blind and naive but I hope our military is more competent and  mentally stable than this guy.

B000MNP2KI|2|When a formula works, you really should stick with it.  The team behind Casino Royale obviously decided to move in a new direction, abandoning key elements of the formula: debonair Bonds, drop dead gorgeous vixens, and incomparable special effects.  Let's start with Daniel Craig.  He just doesn't have it.  He looks too old (this story is supposed to occur early in Bond's career).  His stockiness kills any hope for a fashion sense.  Still, a great actor can overcome these shortcomings to look like a hero (like Tobey Maquire did with Spiderman).  Not Craig.  This man cannot act.  He has a total of two looks in the movie:  a poker face and a constipated canary face.  The later he uses to woo women and to stare down villains.  Apparently, that looked took a lot of work since even it disappeared in the second half of the movie leaving us with a blank poker face. <br /> <br />I guess to keep with a somewhat ugly Bond (whose most notable feature are his satellite dish ears), the producers decided to cast more down to earth females.  I never imagined seeing ladies like this in a Bond movie.  I thought I was watching The Facts of Life.  As for the special effects...they started off good, but just faded into ordinary low budget action thriller effects.   <br /> <br />In short, it was disappointing.  BTW, I won't delve into the lack of continuity of the movie (when compared to other Bond films) as this seems to be a common problem with these movies.
B0055QYKQO|5|I would recommend this board to any first time installers.  It was easy to install and over the phone tech support was great!
B0000C9V3T|4|I loved this CD, but of course... it's missing quite a few songs. The Hattori Hanzo sword song and every song missing from the cd can be found at killbill2.net in the rare music section. Would've gotten 5 stars if it had those songs in the first place.
B0089LOG02|5|Amazing Story! I am so glad I read this story. My family was familiar with the geography and historical details of the story. It really makes you think about fostering children then and now and how the children feel.
B003R1B9MW|4|Heartwarming story to watch if you like sports stories like The Blindside. It's not going to give you the ups and downs or shocking plot twists of more racy movies, but quite honestly sometimes I feel like curling up with a<br />Hot chocolate and watching a non-controversial, solid, heartwarming movie. It's a good family movie too.
B00005YXZH|5|Enough has been written about this album to fill a Proust novel. Sure the record was finished a year before it was released. Sure the same label ended up paying for it twice (after being dropped by a major and then picked up by a subsidiary of the major). Sure critics have been wetting themselves since leaks and live sets started showcasing songs nearly two years ago now. Bottom line is, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is a great record. It chirps and buzzes like Radiohead and the Flaming Lips. It rollicks like the Replacements used to and the Strokes do now. It's as heart-felt as a Neal Young album, as universal as Sonic Youth at their broadest strokes, as expansive as the late Beatles, and yet as simple and tender as early Joni Mitchell. And it does it all at once.<br />The first track, \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" picks up where \\"She's a Jar\\" left off, wistfully abusing a pop melody. The latter's line, \\"you know she begs me not to hit her\\" completes a wash of romanticized images the same way the I Am Trying does before ending on an endless negative mantra worthy of a Nirvana song. Great simple pop songs like \\"Kamera,\\" \\"War on War\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" are gracefully interspersed with sparse compositions like \\"Radio Cure,\\" where singer Tweedy croons, \\"there is something wrong with me,\\" as if he were terminally pensive. Two songs later he tries to cheer up Christ, singing, \\"Jesus don't cry, you can rely on me honey.\\" And the timely (although written long before 9/11) \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" goes somewhere in between, stating simply, \\"I want a good life, with a nose for things / a fresh wind and bright sky to endure my suffering.\\" <br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is probably as close to a Paxil-loving Pet Sounds as we'll ever see. It's something to aspire to, and something to celebrate amidst all the tattered pop clichés. It's a hype worth the wear, a box of tunes worth the listen, an independent triumph, and a achievement that proves American ingenuity goes on despiteall the warnings of life during wartime.
B00ILHW6AG|2|What a disappointment.  It started off with all the wonderful and well drawn characters for whom you could wish.  By the end of the first quarter of the book, it began to become boring and nonsensical.  The ending was one of the worst of any book I've read.  King is capable of genius; I don't know what happened here, but it's not good.  I don't read much fiction, but I always buy the latest Stephen King novel.  I can only give it 2 stars instead of one because of the quality of the first quarter of the book.
B008CJ0KBU|5|Not since \Season Four of Buffy the Vampire Slayer has a show been so smoking hot.  Anna Silk and her friends steam up the screen so much you forget that the plot is kind of lame.

B004ETVAH0|1|The first few songs were ok, but overall this is one of the worst CDs I have ever purchased. I could not even make it all the way through. There is very little that is rock n' roll about this CD, title notwithstanding. It is sappy, pop crap stuff. The woman singer is insufferable. I simply do not understand how anyone could give this CD a five star rating. I would give it zero stars if I could, and I wish I could get my money back.

B00IFMHZ58|1|Kristen Bell is a great actress, the premise of the story is believable, however, the direction, the editing, some of the casting, and just about everything else that goes into making a good movie is missing in this one. I really tried to get through the entire movie.... it ended up insulting me for a number of reasons. Most of all because I felt duped for falling for the hype.

B009WO7NQO|1|I let my 6yo son play this on my Kindle and then one day I notice that I have a $1.99 and $9.99 purchase on my Amazon account. He bought something called Mighty Falcon Small Bundle and Mighty Falcon Large Bundle. I looked around on the app and found there is even a 19.99 bundle that you can buy. It just takes 2 clicks to make the purchase, no password required. I had no idea they added in app purchases on this one. This will probably be the last Rovio purchase that I make.
B005LAIHY0|4|[[ASIN:B005LAIHY0 Prometheus (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy)]]<br /><br />I will say on it's own merits, the movie is good but not great. There are many theories about what RS was REALLY trying to say about who the Engineers were. I won't get into that because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.<br /><br />I think if you're a fan of religious studies or mythology, you will be able to see certain patterns and read in between the lines, at least enough to realize certain themes, and that no info, plot point, date, or number given is a mere coincidence but rather a reference to someone else to help give subtext to the story.<br /><br />While I enjoy the movie quite a bit, more so the second viewing, I was left wondering if RS edited himself and the story he intended to tell to have the answers be in future movies, or because he was afraid of the backlash from religious fanatics if he outright said what he wanted to say.<br /><br />On a different note, the movie is visually fantastic and stunning. The sense of scale is literally awesome, and it does a great job of showing us how puny us as humans really are.
B0028IDXDS|3|Binky detached from the monkey :( my kid was heartbroken
B0090SI3EI|5|Good.
0140288503|5|Like the average citizen, I don't know much about military strategy, foreign policy, etc. and was unsure if I'd get a lot out of BHD. But the book held my attention until the very end -- through the epilogue, AND afterword, AND comments in the &quot;sources&quot; section -- the book was 100% accessible.<br />There has never been a book I've read yet where I felt I was there. Anyway, I don't think I can say much that's not already been said, except this:<br />I would advise EVERYONE who's not read the book but has seen the movie to go ahead and read the book. Even though the movie was good, it's only 10% of what the book is, both in it's detail and emotion.<br />What a marvelous book. I regret not reading it sooner or going to any book signings.

B00002MZ2T|5|Savage Garden has done it again...their second album is amazing. Darren Hayes has such a beautiful voice, and he puts it to good use!  (i.e., he doesn't sing only ballads like Sarah Maclachlan) And Daniel is incredibly  talented--they're an awesome duo! The slow songs are so touching, with  great lyrics and catchy tunes.(I want to play them at my wedding) And the  fast songs have good beats and a lot of infectious energy. I love it!   Admittedly, some of the lyrics in the title track are so sappy they should  be in a Disney flick, but it doesn't detract from the overall presentation  of the album. This is an absolute must-have for your collection!

6305907145|3|Mansfield Park is one of the more problematic of the Austen creations, mostly because of the heroine, Fanny Brice, who maddens readers with her passivity, goodness and inability to take any initiative. Her method is to be good and wait for good things to happen to her. Of course, ultimately they do when she captures the heart of her drippy cousin Edmund.<br />  This movie inserts a few little touches to \\"bring it up to date,\\" notably a few allusions to the evils of slavery upon which the Mansfield Park finances depend (there is a distant, unseen sugar plantation in Antigua) and also a slight hint of lesbianism which is enough to titillate the senses but no more.<br />If you don't expect too much, we have all the traditional Austen themes in plentiful supply -- the obligatory ball, the walks in the country, a bit of horse riding, a little hint of poverty, a little sexual politics, a rake, a scheming gold digger etc etc.<br />It's fine for an evening in front of the fire. No more, no less.
B007J4T2G8|5|The book was fabulous. I had heard the hype and thought it would be a ridiculous romance novel but it was far from that.  It pushed the boundaries of literature far past what I expected.  I cannot wait to read the book 2!
B005GFPZYK|5|Easily one of the best books I've ever read.  I can't even begin to imagine what the SEALs have to endure just to earn a Trident.  And it only gets worse when they're actually out there protecting themselves and other brave warriors.  They are a big part of what makes America great.  They are a big part of what makes me proud to be an American.

B0039M3RH4|5|This rare and beautiful film, based on a book that is felt as much as read, transcends the medium to become art. Painted on a vast desert canvas with deep rich oils, its beauty is felt as much as seen. This film will find your heart and remain there forever. If love had a face, it would look like this.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella's screenplay shifts the center of Michael Ondaatje's story slightly in order to capture on film the essence of his beautiful prose. Ondaatje's novel is one of poetic beauty, a potrait of a rose beneath the water's surface. The film brings that beautiful rose out of the water and into the sunlight. The book and the film are so deeply intertwined you can not watch this film without wanting to read the book, nor can you read the book without wanting to see the film. The story itself centers around three people either in love with, or haunted by ghosts they have loved and lost to war.<br /><br />Juliette Binoche gives an Oscar winning performance as Hana, a kind nurse with a gentle spirit but a damaged heart. She latches onto the burned and charred body of a man known only as the English patient, and ends up caring for him in a shell ravaged Italian villa in Tuscany where she feeds him plums and reads to him. When a man named Caravaggio with scars of his own arrives, the mystery of who the English patient really is begins to unfold via flashbacks. In the present, Hana begins to let her heart heal when she falls in love with a Sikh who disarms bombs left by the Germans.<br /><br />It is the memories of the English patient, however, which are at the heart of this film. Ralph Fiennes gives a subtle performance as the introspective Almasy, part of an international expedition mapping an unending desert with both the romance, and the danger of the sea. Kristin Scott Thomas is wonderful as Katherine Clifton, the stunningly beautiful and enigmatic wife of a fellow mapper. An instant but unspoken attraction between she and Almasy finally becomes too unbearable to ignore and the affair that holds the key to the mystery surrounding the English patient begins.<br /><br />This is one of the most romantic films ever made and is filled with the joy and anguish of love and war. It shows that while war may create logistical lines that can not be crossed, the heart has no boundaries. Anyone who has ever experienced a love of such emotional intensity and physical longing that love and need became one will understand the love affair of Katherine and Almasy.<br /><br />Cinematographer John Seale has given this film a grace and beauty seldom seen on film. A haunting score full of mystery and romance from Gabriel Yard accompany scenes never to be forgotten, and will not be described here in case you have not yet seen them. Director Anthony Minghella explores the mystery of the desert, and the heart, which according to the \\"The Histories\\" by Herodotus, a book the English patient clings to, is an organ of fire. If there is but one ounce of romance in your soul, you will love this meticulously charted and romantic map of the human heart, as wide and treacherous as the unending desert.

0062073486|4|Mystery novels are one of the most popular types of fiction. Anyone who loves the genre is, at some point, going to run up to Agatha Christie and her most famous mystery, \\"And Then There Were None\\". Of the eighty books she wrote, this one is the most popular for a reason: it's unlike anything else you'll read.<br /><br />On a sunny August day, ten strangers are summoned to Indian Island. What begins as a holiday in an exciting locale turns deadly when, after dinner, a record is played that incriminates each of the eight guests, along with the butler and his wife, of murder. Each of them has killed another person (or people) in a way that makes them untouchable by the law - a drowning that seems \\"accidental\\", a car accident, a death on the operating table, etc. Shortly after the record is played, one of the guests is found dead. Initially, the others think that is must be suicide, but when the bodies start piling up, they realize that there is a killer in thier midst. And the murderer is using the verses of a nursery rhyme, Ten Little Indians, to determine how each victim dies.<br /><br />As the number of people on the island begins to dwindle, the tension increases. The strangers, who initially cling to each other, begin to turn against one another as they realize the killer is still hunting. But what will happen when there is no one left?<br /><br />This novel is quite different from most of Agatha Christie's work because it does not feature either one of her two most famous characters, Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple. It also has an ingenious way of dealing with the murders - and the murderer. My only beef with the book is that the killer's name is printed in large font on the final page. If you're like me, and you like to see exactly how many pages are in the book you're reading, try to skip it on this one. You don't want to be spoiled for the ending like I was.
B00GTCECVG|5|Really great game very addictive need lots of money to play properly though.be careful don't get sucked in
0385343175|3|Although I completed the book, it was not without physically making myself.  Nothing in the book was extraordinary, nothing leaped out and grabbed my attention and made me want to finish reading it, as I was expecting.  Seems like a bunch of fluff for Danielle steel fans to get their fix, without any real substance.  I finished the book, and that's about all I can say positive on it.
B001EZ2T7W|5|I purchased this after the series was over. It did pretty much follow the movie. With Stargate was still on the air.
B007KOYEOC|5|An amazing ending to such a good triligy of the 50 Shades series. It was one of the stories that really got you in. once you started reading the first book you couldn't put it down wondering what was going to happen next. Not a story that I normally would be interested in, but a girlfriend talked me into reading them. Just couldn't put it down. Loved the set, great story line, that just sucked you in.  Loved them !!!

The bad news is that you need at least two: One modern a la Uchida for example, and one period, a la Gardiner for example. There are lots to chose from...<br /><br />This is a much valued addition to my collection. A stunning box set. Personally, I love the sound of the piano. As a whole the music on this box is alive and electric.<br /><br />As for you, the one who is unsure about this- get it, rip it, keep the box as a collector's edition...
B000286SCO|5|i saw the live in japan show on vhs years ago and i thought it was great. with this two disc set you get to watch the band grow from images and words all the way up through the falling into infinity tour. there are many gems in this set and it is strongly reccomended to any fan of dream theater
B008KRJWEK|2|I started out and everything was great. Played it for a while then it froze. Now every time I click the Icon it acts like its loading then it brings me back to my homepage. It's ridiculous and they need to fix it.
B00KNWYDU8|5|Great game.:)
B0041KVZ0Y|5|I bought this vinyl edition of Rubber Soul to replace my original copy which was over forty years old and needed to be retired. I also have it on I Tunes and CD, but there is something about the old vinyl that provides a richness and depth of sound that digital just cannot reproduce. Its a great album and its wonderful to listen to it as the Beatles intended for us to hear it. Sometimes you just can't improve on the original
B00P77ZAN8|5|Verry addictive very fun
B00KWVZ750|4|I love it! It's a great game, but so addictive..keep wanting to get farther and farther and beat those mean piggies!
B00BEIYM42|5|A co-worker recommended this movie to me.  Unfortunately I did not get to the theater to see it so I ordered it on-line as soon as it was released.  I loved everything about this heartwarming movie!
B00CKOYVG8|5|angry birds beats me everytime, but I will not give up!!!  ITis another game I have to play for hours
B004ISVH6G|4|Been a fan for years, actually got to see John at a small venue in Birmingham called WorkPlay. I gave this record a first listen today and can say John sounds fantastic, the songs are well written, recorded and produced. John is back at his Rock Roots, many people undervalue his ability on straight up Rock --- DON\\"T UNDERESTIMATE JOHN WAIT----<br /> Buy this record!!
B0000B1OGD|4|This was one of the least financially successful of stop-motion animation master Ray Harryhausen films, which is a shame, since it's one of the wildest and most interesting. Based on an idea by Willis O'Brien, the visual effects master on the 1933 \\"King Kong,\\" \\"The Valley of Gwangi\\" is basically a re-imagining of \\"Kong\\" as a Western. Yep, you heard that right, pardners: this is a Giant Monster meets the Western film.<br />Now come on, that's got your attention, right?<br />\\"Gwangi\\" is just a blast. Watching the mixture of cowboy antic with a lost land of dinosaurs is the ultimate Saturday morning matinee experience. The kid in you will just wake up right away and start cheering. (As for kids themselves, do you really have to ask? They'll love this!)<br />At this point in his career, Harryhausen was producing masterful effects and getting more ambitious with each film. Here he has a sequence of cowboys roping an Allosaurus (astounding!), and later a rampaging dinosaur caught in a burning cathedral. Even with today's computer effects, Harryhausen's effects have a wonderful marvel to them, a magic that CGI can't really capture. (Unless you're Peter Jackson.)<br />Like most of the films Harryhasen produced with Charles Schneer, the actual dramatics and script are a bit lacking. James Franciscus is right on the money in his part as the smooth-talking frontier huckster, but Gila Golan is wooden and terrible as his love interest. The dialogue often clunky, but don't worry -- the dinosaurs or a cowboy shoot-up are right about the corner.<BR> <BR>The DVD also contains a featurette interview with Harryhausen, where he explains how the film came to be made and talks about how he achieved the incredible \\"dino-roping\\" sequence. Your appreciation of this visual effects genius will only go up when you hear what he had to do to get this amazing scene to work.<br />Fans of plain old fun films: BUY THIS! Visual effects fans: BUY THIS! Anyone who wants to capture the feeling of beinga kid and loving dinosaurs and cowboys: BUY THIS!
B0000640VN|4|I love both Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan so what could be bad in pairing them up? This film was a joy to watch. It had old New York, time travel and a good love story.After falling through time, Jackman adapts pretty quickly. The small scene with the cop and dog is quite telling of the differences he encounters.Although he's an aristocrat, he is quite the gentleman. Meg is the typical \\"career girl\\" as he dubs her and it's all fun from there.The acting by the supporting cast is wonderful. The movie is just delightful.Watch and enjoy!!!!! Definitely a \\"Chick Flick\\".
0792839625|3|A Chorus Line is a truly great show, when performed onstage keeping true to the original *ahem* SONGS, but the movie kind of failed in the attempt  to re-create the magic. I mean, &quot;Music and The Mirror&quot; is a  perfect example. Did they think it was too subtle for the movie-watching  American public? Did it really have to be replaced with something as blunt  as &quot;Let Me Dance For You&quot;? Puh-leaze. And they cut out the entire  montage, which really helps in exploring the character's personalities,  etc. Why did Cassie seem like such an...annoyance? She did interrupt  &quot;I Can Do That&quot;. She did harass him into giving her a role. She  didn't seem graceful, like in the stage version. (ie, falling while getting  into the taxi)  I really liked the Sheila, and I loved Terrance Mann. I  also found the drag show monologue very well done. It's good, but not even  close to the singular sensation it was onstage.
B00F3W9NQ2|5|I know it's a show for teenagers, but I just love it! I will rent every episode they make !
B00004YRQA|5|Plug it in it works great game flows  smoothly ,these are really had  to find.
0805091742|5|This man is a great story teller, clear writer, with some great stories. Highly readable and an important message - Have already loaned it to others who loved the book too.
B00A3NQNUU|3|WTF. I went to check on the status of the metal habitat I bought yesterday, and all my dragons were gone. I spent money on this game. I was so close to getting the time traveling dragon.<br /><br />I managed to get everything back after uninstalling, reinstalling, logging off and on of Facebook, updating the game, and checking the game for a couple of hours. Warn people when you are going to do a software update. Not all of us are linked to the Facebook page.
B00BD99JMW|3|I love the divergent series but the ending I would so had prefer a better ending am sorry 😔
B002MQYOFW|5|Just stopping in to put my five stars into the pot. I couldn't help comparing this novel to King's The Long Walk, in which I liked better. But, I still need to give credit where credit is due. Very emotional story.
B003MC5N28|5|Classic
0792844890|5|Love anything Mel Brooks does, what a genius. Even my grandchildren love this movie. The man really makes you laugh!

1608198065|5|Fabulous and Brave
B00H58VGIA|5|An excellent read...wish I had something like this book when I was younger.
B007URVZJ6|5|I used this book as I edited, reformatted and uploaded my first book on Kindle. It walked me through the steps. A great feeling to have been able to accomplish my goal. Thanks for the clear directions and help.
B003VVFGWC|5|Great! Witty and dry humor. Kristen is awesome.  I wish it didn't cancel.  I need a 4th and 5th  season.
B00005U122|5|I'm not a huge fan of Pink Floyd but purchased this dvd for the sole purpose of seeing Doyle Bramhall II perform. Wow! The whole dvd is awesome and the sound is great. I can't get enough of the guitar jam at the end of 'Comfortably Numb'! Bramhall and Snowy White rock!!! (This is by far one of the best bargains at $14.98....!)
B00452VF4O|5|Wonderful characterizations and historical depictions.
B004UJTG6Q|5|I read this many moons ago as a young lad and am glad I took the time as an adult to come back to it!  An easy read for the most part, I did get tripped up in some of the dialogue as it was representative of the book's culture and timeframe.  It was nice remembering what it was like being a kid again as I followed Tom's shinanigans.  One important item to note is terms are used that are not considered politically correct in today's day and age.  Keep in mind these terms were accepted as the &#34;norm&#34; at the time the story takes place.  Don't get wrapped up over the axle about it...just enjoy the book for what it is...the adventures of a boy with a very active imagination and a lot of energy!
B00HBQWGXK|3|Not as good as previous books by Lee Child's that I have read.
B000NA2776|5|Songs are unique and funny.  I only knew one song when I bought the CD but like all the rest just as much now.
B009NT4D8E|5|Oh boy i love this.....I really do. Gives hope to dummies like me who didnt know what to think when i 1st saw it. And after watching it 100 times i really can say i understand alot about the regular film.Now with the added information things are even brighter. you have a fan forever over this film 20th Century Fox. Please do a Prometheus 2 i want more information....An A+++++ from me...  PS. You WILL need a blue ray DVD player for all but one of the discs. That being said it is well worth the money.....
B00005YUNY|5|This is, as many others have said and will continue to say, a terrific album and well worth the money. I get chills when I hear Alan playing innovative fills (for once) in Starship Trooper. Gates of Delirium just blows me away. I could probably watch this DVD 4 or 5 times without stopping. It's just that good. With that in mind, I'm going to pick out some of the details and blow them out of proportion for the sake of illumination. I'm an audiophile, so little things stand out to me. <br />1. Close to the Edge is my favorite song, but they need to put more energy into it; they keep slowing it down. This is mostly in the beginning, but later it gets better. <br />2. I do have a problem with the mixing. Although some people like it, Jon's voice is just too loud, and there needs to be more bass, keys, and symphony. After all, this is Yes Symphonic. <br />3. Owner of a Lonely Heart is the worst-performed song on there. The song is designed for a thick, aggressive sound (think House of Yes), and when you put Chris's square white bass (which is not adjusted well, sound-wise, as opposed to his Rickenbacker) in with, frankly, lazy guitar playing by Steve, along with keyboards that are half the volume they should be, or less, with Alan playing as tight-hattedly as possible, you end up with a very thin, weak sound. <br />4. There really needs to be more keyboard sound. Really. I know it's the third time I've mentioned it, but it's true. Guitar, vocals, and drums do NOT make up the entire group, they don't make up 80% of the group, they are 3 entities out of 5 (plus the orchestra). The other guys should have their say. After all, they're virtuosos, too. <br />5. I made a remark about Alan hardly ever playing innovative fills. I didn't really mean for that to sound negative or critical; it's more of a rejoicing that he put in something really cool rather than just supportive. I listen to a lot of Yes and I hear all sorts of places that he could just throw in a few beats of wildness and get away with it, but he very, very rarely does. Not a crack against his abilities (he's a friggin' genius), I just think he should break out of his box a little more. <br /> <br />As I said before, I'm making mountains out of molehills. This really is a great DVD and I would readily recommend it to anyone who likes Yes. Yes has always been an amazing band and they'll continue to be, if not in person then through their great legacy of recordings.
B003E8P9G0|5|awesome I like this book very much.now I'm just adding words because my kindle tells me I am supposed to.
031606792X|1|I've read the entire series and I found the books unfit for children.  The author attempts to make this a teenage love story but it isn't.  The female character is 17; the main male character was turned at 17 and has been around for another several decades. (This is clearly an adult having sexual relationship with a teenage.  Then theirs the imprinting of the teenage wolves on small girls. This series has strong pedophile undercurrents.  I don't recommend this book for tweens or teens.
B00FATEJYE|5|I love this game looks good and great flow of combat I like how u can link it to console version also. An amazing game to play..
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is great and if you can not get flappy bird this is the game.  I like this game because it is exactly like flappy bird. I think it sucks that u can not get flappy bird on a kindle or kindle fire.
B00T4837W2|5|Awesome movie. Saw at the theater and has to see it again. One to keep for your collection
B005AKFXZW|5|This is a novel of lyrical language, that is neither inaccessible or overwrought. Multiple viewpoints and timelines can make the reader focus a little harder at first, but I soon relaxed and felt in secure hands. Nothing is extraneous and everything is interwoven into an exquisite whole.  I often think if a reviewer gives away too much of the story that there is no point in me reading the book. This book follows the story of two children suddenly cast as the pawns in a bizarre wager between two men.  Nevertheless, as they mature, they evolve into people capable of subverting the game. The manner in which they do so is both sacrificial and transcendent. If ever a book lived up to rave reviews, this one did.
B00BLCHYKU|5|Great show!!!!
B007HACDLK|5|Vince Flynn is my favorite writer. I have read all of his books.<br />Would recomend to anyone that likes fast action packed reading.
B0031YJFCQ|4|I was glad to read this series although it wasn't easy reading. I loved the story line but didn't get lost in it as I do a lot of the books I read.
038533348X|5|One of my favorite books by him. Book came in perfect condition. Very very happy
B000HKYA1I|5|spoiler alert.<br />this movie is hilarious and it packs a punch.
B001DJLCRC|5|If the first ten minutes of S1E1 of this show don't immediately hook you and gain your interest, just give up:  it's not for you.  There are reasons that Bryan Cranston won so many Emmy awards for 'Best Actor.'  Watch this show to see why.  The show-runner, Vince Gilligan, used to write for the X Files, and he and his team of writers really know how to pace a show.  This program is right up there with the best television shows of all time.
B001BTG3OQ|3|This is a decent speedlight.  But I have two issues with it.  1) The hole where you put the sync cord or the cord to the Pocket Wizard is too big and the cord falls out.  The only way to fix this has been for me to keep a rubberband around the cord pushing it into the hold tightly.  Even a screw-in cord hasn't been successful. The other issue is the over-heating.  It doesn't happen that often but it's annoying when it does happen.  At least the unit stops firing and doesn't commit suicide by overheating or that would make me REALLY angry.    But overall, it gets the job done and batteries last pretty long too.
B006UW4OB8|5|This works great I will use it for the rest of my days so be glad. So yes it works.
B000O77SRC|5|Okay, this is one of those action films that really works. Alongside Speed & Face/Off, Die Hard is superb as it delivers a whole lot of high-octane action. The story is...well, who really cares about the story? You already know that it's a bit cliched and doesn't really offer anything fresh. But what's so obviously great about this film is the action. The gunfights and the explosions (as well as the stunt work) are spectacular, and many of the action sequences still hold up today. Both Bruce Willis & Alan Rickman are excellent as the hero & villain, though I do think that the villain here, named Gruber, is way more interesting than Willis himself. Rickman's character is still the best villain in the entire Die Hard series, and his suave but cynical appearance/personality is proof of that. So basically, Die Hard is one of those action films that you MUST see before you die. It's got what you would expect in an action film: intense gun battles, clever dialogue, and a mano-a-mano between Willis and Rickman. The only problem is the music, which can be quite over-the-top at times. But still, this film is solid.<br /><br />Grade: A-
B00GTCECVG|2|I think this game is great but I'm a girl and I guess boy's are desperate for girlfriends because I got asked out a lot. I wish they could change that to where if somebody asked somebody else out they should be banned from the game. Seriously, why would you ask somebody out when you don't know the other person and you could be under 15! Like I said, enjoyable game but boy's who are under ten are so desperate for love it's creepy, annoying and you feel threatened. I deleted the game twice and I don't think I'll get the app again. I almost think this war game have turned into a dating site. I heard it was really popular and I can't deny it is but they ask you so much personal stuff I thought the players were stalkers. This is not for people who feel paranoid sometimes because before I played this game I felt fine but when people started asking me personal questions I felt threatened. If you get this app, make sure you read this and you're at least 14. But if you're not 14, DON'T GET THIS APP!!!!!!
B00FRVH3V6|5|Great ending to a great story. I recommend this book and the whole series and anything by this author. Excellscior
B00B2V66VS|5|Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Babkoonosh happy to you. I heart t. Run 2 and so will you.
B0007Y4TVU|5|In my opinion this is the best I've heard of System of a Down. I also read a few other reviews and would like to correct someone who stated that they fired Serj. This isn't true, in fact the band just announced a summer tour with The Mars Volta which will definately be cool.  <br /> <br />Now back to the album. There are few albums in my collection that I can started from track 1 and leave all the way through. All though Mezmerize is somewhere around 30 minutes, each song changes so often that it seems much longer. I don't mind Daron taking a little more spotlight as he and Serj compliment each other well. I'm very anxious for the next CD Hypnotize this fall, and encourage you all to buy this album and support an original band that you can just about positively say will NEVER sell out.
B003VPWXRO|5|I was completely captivated by Portia's view of herself...this is truly a brave and compelling journey of loving yourself...I am glad she had the courage to open herself up and write this book.
B003H6KRIE|5|It's Bourne with Matt Damon OK, that's all that needs to be said. Not enough thumbs for the amount of awesomeness that is this trilogy.
B00CSR2J9I|5|When will we get the  beach format with the air boat ???  Just got it on my computer with Windows 8.  We need an update . Love this game .
0767836324|5|arrived perfect
B000002B7O|5|That's right folks, this album not Master of Puppets, not Paranoid, not ZOSO, not Machine Head, not Back in Black, is the greatest metal album I've ever heard in my life.  Why?  Because this is the fullest extent of the heavy metal experiment, an experiment started in the late 1950s to today.  It isn't about how heavy the album is, how ridiculously virtuosic the guitar solos are: it is about mood.  This album is the epitome of metal; it has both crazy thrash your head metal music and dark oh my I think I'm insane music.  The definition of the heavy metal album.
B002OR0RP0|5|kid loved it.
B00881VLCE|5|Exceptional puzzle app.  Love the sound effects when you turn or place puzzle pieces. Makes it sound like you are sorting real pieces. You have options of creating puzzles with more or fewer pieces depending on how difficult you want it. There are other ways to modify difficulty as well. Although you do need to buy additional puzzles after a while, they are well worth the nominal fee and by that time you'll know if you really like the app. For those who have a motto against purchasing apps there is the option of creating endless free puzzles using your own pics.  Imagine a picture of Aunt Debbie's Annual family picnic as a puzzle.<br />You will not regret getting this app.
B004SIIBGU|3|Greatly restricts your ability to search for items.<br />Very good to monitor items you are bidding on.<br />Would like to be able to shop more.
B009CF7JDU|5|Nice and funny.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Very fun game. Nice graphics very smooth a bit tricky to play on a tablet but it makes it all the more fun and challenging.
B00T47ZXIE|5|It was a different and interesting view!
B0026OE2NY|5|The best documentary ever. It sums up our history and relationship with our planet earth; and predict our future.<br />Beautifully done.<br />A masterpiece that everyone must keep at home!
B00DR0PDNE|5|What to say about this. One of the great electronic device, that I purchased in recent times. Very easy to use and loving it. People say that, why do you buy a new product, just use your laptop throught hdmi. Just use this once, you will change your statement.
B00AECDDYY|5|You are the pirate against not only opposing ships, but cannon and embankments. There are not only 5 levels for each round-up starting at easy continuing up to challenging, etc. But 4 different pirate worlds to sail your ships. Strengthen your ships and homesteads and use the clock wisely.<br />My 5 year old can play on easy, while I sneak in the game at challenging. Wonderful!
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Great, quick read.  Lots of characters to keep track if at first so I didn't want to put it down.  They all weave into a tragic story so beautifully.
B00QLVY7J2|5|New quests are fun...
B001PJ7TUE|4|Like most who have posted I am a long time Prodigy fan. I heavily criticized their previous CD: Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned for it's new (scream punk) approach that some liked others didn't.<br /><br />And now we have Invaders must die.<br /><br />Hmmm let see... its...<br /><br />Cyber-punk incarnate, It's a blend of their new punk image with a mix of their rave/techno past. With hints of chip music (which I like) and old school recycled 90s dance riffs (like streets of rage).<br /><br />Overall I love most of it... the innovation is there without alienating their original fan base.<br /><br />The songs I like:<br /><br />Omen<br />Worlds on Fire<br />Take me to the Hospital<br />Warriors Dance<br />Thunder<br />Stand Up<br /><br />In pretty much that order.<br /><br />It's a solid CD and it's a personally exciting because no band has the same formula as prodigy. They are unique but consistant in their ramping and (beat-breaks)&(breakbeats). The songs warp, glitch(figuratively speaking), with unexpected twists but leave you with a ultimately satisfying adventure.
B00005YW4H|5|As a jaded, been there listened to that, 36 year old, semi-professional jazz musician, I was astonished to find myself instantly and utterly transfixed by Norah's music when she first came to the UK. This does not happen to me any more than once in a decade and it certainly never happens with music that it so heavily indebted to the country tradition. Yet there I was, almost beside myself with joy.<br />From a musician's perspective, her control, tone, intonation, timing and the sheer beauty of her presentation are extraordinary, but, far more importantly, Ms Jones manages to reach those areas of emotional understanding that touch the very depths of what it means to be human. This is a life affirming album of the utmost quality. Without any hint of pretentiousness, restrained, cultured and yet bristling with that raw energy and passion that can only come from a potent cocktail of youth and immense talent, Norah Jones encapsulates the real meaning of jazz as a lifestyle, rather than a form of music.<br />Greater versatility and a few more years will be needed before serious comparisons can be made, but I genuinely believe that Norah Jones has the potential to achieve true greatness. Not the kind of `pop' greatness reserved for the likes of Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston, but the true musical greatness of a Billie Holiday or Ella Fitzgerald.<br />I feel privileged to be part of a world in which such beauty is available for all to hear.
B00DPM7TIG|5|This book was beautifully written.  I felt very connected to all the characters. The only thing I disliked was in my opinion the ending felt rushed.
B000ZK4466|5|...of their first three albums. Also boasts one of their finest album closers \\"Conjugal Burns\\". In my opinion they keep getting better with every successive album (despite what DITC & FTM fanatics may say). This cd is definitely worth buying.
B00D6BQG1W|5|Love this movie. It is over the top, ridiculous, and fun!
B003KLGKAA|5|This season is the best as all previous seasons lead up to this one! The writers set it up from the first season to combine a perfect funny and dramatic season. Donna Noble is the best companion for the Dr. as she is not in love with him and her comedic, stubbornness helps the Dr. be more humane. Best season of the series but I suggest watching all the seasons first along with the specials!
0307887448|5|Fantastic book!  I read all the time but haven't read fiction in probably a decade.  Heard about this book on Reddit.  Absolutely loved it, and could totally see how much fun the author was having in writing it.  Great ending too.
B005DMNS4A|5|This album is a concept album about teenage angst sang from all different angles and perspectives. It's flow is very similar to how \\"Tommy\\" worked in the sense that all the songs connect to a general theme and the music is arranged in an orchestral fashion. Sometimes this album can get pretty dark lyric wise and the music also sometimes reflects teenage frustration. The music has the rock and roll feel embedded in it but at the same time, psychedelic tendencies are found a lot throughout the album. Even in an album about how hard life is as a teenager, the lyrics have glimpses of hope and messages about rising above it all. This is definitely one of the Who's best albums, right up there with \\"Who's Next?\\" and \\"Tommy\\". It took me a couple listens to completely absorb it all but every time I finished the album, I wanted to push the play button again so I highly recommend this album to Who fans and to people who like psychedelic rock or rock that has a raw honest quality to it with amazing arrangements and composition.<br /><br />Buy.
B00B2V66VS|5|My son loves playing this game!
B0000640VO|5|I held out to get this movie for too long. Really, this is the movie that you will be passing around the neighborhood with great reviews. Your friends will be asking your opinion about other movies. The secret is all in this remarkable story that is guaranteed to charm. Subtitles only. It has an R rating, but in my opinion it wasn't deserved.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Beautifully and realistically written. Worth getting emotionally involved with.
B0015AARJI|5|no difference between it and the original. very reliable and good product. still i test it for time of discharging
0141192410|4|Little Women is a wonderful classic, worthy of a space on anyone's bookshelf - especially with this version's beautiful binding.
B0006L16N8|4|After I listened from Square One to Til Kingdom Come, first thing that came to my mind was that this cd doesn't sound anything like Parachutes or Rush of Blood to the Head.  I liked it though. I don't necessarily think it's better than Rush of Blood nor as good. Out of all the songs from the three Coldplay cd's, I think the weakest lay in X&Y. But, this just shows how amazing Coldplay is: There are only 2 or 3 weak songs on X&Y, a few good ones, and a few amazing ones.  IMO the best cd's in order are   A Rush of Blood To The Head  Parachutes (Close second)  X&Y  (really close third)    Highlights:    Square One  What If  Fix You  X&Y  Speed Of Sound  A Message  Swallowed In The Sea  Twisted Logic  Til Kingdom Come
B00F5FBE82|4|I'm a Drake fan and I think that this album was great (lyrically developed and very professional production) but Take Care was better just because his flows had more cleverness and rhythm variation.

B003AYPMBU|5|Metal Gods Judas Priest released its sixth studio album British Steel in May of 1980.<br />The album was a change for the band in several ways. First, the band (which consisted of lead singer Rob Halford, lead guitarists Glenn Tipton and KK Downing and bass player Ian Hill) got a new drummer out of ex-Trapeze drummer Dave Holland (who would be their second long serving drummer (only his successor Scott Travis has been with them for 19 years)). Second, the band recruited producer Tom Allom (beginning a decade long association with the band after being an engineer for Black Sabbath in the early 1970s and also produced Def Leppard's superb debut album). Third, the band released their first album of the decade they would reign supreme, the 1980s. Recorded at Titenhurst Park (the estate of Beatle Ringo Starr (previously owned by his deceased bandmate John Lennon)), they created a masterpiece which is still one of the best albums ever made (as I found out when I bought the original US cassette edition in 1997 (I was familiar with three tracks on the disc &#34;Breaking the Law&#34;, &#34;Metal Gods&#34; and &#34;Living After Midnight&#34; as they were on the 2-CD best of Metal Works)).<br />The original US album opened with &#34;Breaking the Law&#34; which is one of the band's best loved tracks and a great song still to this day. Next is the track &#34;Rapid Fire&#34; (which opened the UK issue of the album and opens the remastered CD (the US version switched tracks around)) which is a fast, prototype speed-metal kick*ss rocker. Great lyrics and superb guitar dueling by Tipton and Downing. Next is the great rocker (which became the band's nickname by fans and rock journalists) &#34;Metal Gods&#34;. Halford's superb singing and sci-fi lyrics coupled with Downing and Halford's riffing makes this a killer rocker. We then have &#34;Grinder&#34; which is another rocker with raunchy, in a good way, lyrics, and another staple of the band's. The first half ends with the track &#34;United&#34;. Like &#34;Take on the World&#34; (on 1979's Hell Bent For Leather), this is an uplifting, singalong anthem and is also one of the greatest rock/metal anthems ever written.<br />&#34;Living After Midnight&#34; (which kicked off Side Two of original US/Canadian release) is next and was one of Priest's first US rock radio hits and became a staple of American rock radio. This track may have been seen as sellout city but its hook, riffs and lyrics make this song rock. Next is &#34;You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise&#34; (which was the first track on Side Two of the UK release of the album) and is an underrated, great track. Next is &#34;The Rage&#34; which starts with a cool bass guitar riff from Hill before turning into an epic rocker with some uneartly Downing guitar solos. We close the album with the fast heavy rocker &#34;Steeler&#34;. It has more classic guitar work, singing and lyrics. A kick*ss way to close the album.<br />British Steel became Judas Priest's first US Top 40 charting album and first Gold seller (would hit Platinum after the success of 1982's Screaming For Vengeance) for good reason. The songs, production, playing and the resurrection of hard rock and metal at the time made this a timeless album.<br />The remastered CD version of the album features the tracks in its UK sequence (&#34;Rapid Fire&#34;, &#34;Metal Gods&#34;, &#34;Breaking the Law&#34;, &#34;Grinder&#34;, &#34;United&#34;, &#34;You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise&#34;, &#34;Living After Midnight&#34;, &#34;The Rage&#34; and &#34;Steeler&#34;) plus an outtake from the scrapped double Twin Turbos album (which became Turbo in 1986) entitled &#34;Red White and Blue&#34; which was a great power ballad. It's ironic that Judas Priest, (a British metal band), wrote a song about what is also construed as an anthem for American pride. There's also a live version of &#34;Grinder&#34; from 1984's Defenders Of the Faith Tour.<br />In 2010, the album was re-released for its 30th Anniversary. The 2001 CD is included but also a live DVD of the band performing the album at the Hard Rock in Seminole, Florida in 2009 (this was one of KK Downing's last shows before he would retire from the band in 2011) plus classics like &#34;The Ripper&#34;, &#34;Prophecy&#34;, &#34;Hell Patrol&#34;, &#34;Victim of Changes&#34;, &#34;Freewheel Burning&#34;, &#34;Diamonds and Rust&#34; and &#34;You've Got Another Thing Coming&#34; in one killer show (I saw this tour a month before the show was filmed and Priest were on fire). Plus a 2010 interview with the band on how this album was made. Also there was a 2-CD/DVD edition which featured all plus the audio CD of the concert (sans &#34;Prophecy&#34;) and packaged in a digipak which folded out but a stellar reissue to a classic album.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!rsary.

B003XF1XOQ|4|The ending was the best part of the book! The test was not as good as the other books were.
B00BATG18K|5|Amy Tan has an enormous talent for creating a layered nuanced plot.  In books like &#34;One Hundred Secret Senses&#34; this richness and character development is created through the past vs present life, the mundane converging with the spiritual and unseen.  In &#34;The Valley of Amazement&#34; it is created by the ever changing experience, maturing of the protagonist, her descriptions and impressions of her mother juxtaposed with her mother's actual history and feelings and an epic sweep of time and events.  As with other books by Tan a sense of place, historical context and culture bring the book to life and lend a depth and complexity that makes reading her books so incredibly satisfying.  In this book in particular the meticulous descriptions of the clothing, the details of furnishings, food, add to this heady brew.  And there is suspense, mysteries, adversity that made it an addictive page-turner.  It's almost hard to read anything else after reading Amy Tan.
B007L96SI6|5|I've been waiting for this release for a long time. Haley was my personal fovorite last year on American Idol. Not a bad song on the CD. Haley co-wrote all but one song. Favorites are Liar and Wasted Tears. Not sure how it will be received but personally I think this has multi-platinum written all over it. I can hear her songs being blasted from car stereos all Summer long. Nicely done.
B00127RAJY|5|I went from 122 to 114 in about 6 weeks doing 30 Day Shred M-Th, No More Trouble Zones (also Jillian) Sat, and rest on Sunday. I have never been in such good shape and have arms I didn't think were possible!<br /><br />**Tips for beginners**<br />1.  Your first goal should be to finish the workout. Nothing is more deflating then to get all excited about a new exercise routine and crash and burn on the first day. You are much less likely to stick with it if you feel like a failure off the bat, so take it easy at first. It is better to go 50% and finish the workout then to blow through half the workout at 100%. Go as easy as you need to, but never stop a workout once you start. The psychological difference is huge.<br /><br />2. My calves were so sore after the first time it took me 3 days to recover. The second time I restarted the program I was smarter. Err on the side of caution and back off if you feel burning during the jump rope or jumping jacks. Again, you want to finish the tape and be well enough to repeat the next day.<br /><br />3.  There is no time for drink breaks by design; if you feel thirsty during a half hour workout you aren't drinking enough water during the day.<br /><br />I have also recently started a newer Jillian DVD, Ripped in 30, but will hold off on the review until I complete a cycle. So far it is comparable to Shred and a nice change.<br /><br />Good luck and happy sweating!
