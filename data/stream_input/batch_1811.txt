0143115014|4.0|So many good, critical reviews here I won't repeat their remarks.<br /><br />To sum it all up, the 2012 Hall of Fame FiFi award went to Issey Miyake's L'Eau d'Issey.<br />And, imo, well deserved.<br />But the authors review is an adequate rating- 3 star-  and an almost complete brush off.<br /><br />The book was fun to read- the snark, the vernacular, the absences (What? Where is...?) but I'm glad I got it from the library. It's not worth my bookshelf space.
0307744434|5.0|I am officially a 'dreamer' after this book.  In describing it to my family I said \\"A cross between 'Harry Potter' and 'The Time Traveler's Wife'\\".  It combined all of the best elements of both for me and captured my interest.  VERY GOOD READ!!!
0547884591|5.0|I am a long time amazon shopper but this is the first time I felt compelled to write a review.  Tim Ferris' first two books have had a lasting impact on my day to day so I was going read the 4HC no matter what.  And I was not surprised to find that his 3rd book is a true gift of information and he shares models/approaches which you can apply to learning anything.  It's an enjoyable read and you can absolutely make an amazing meal in just a few minutes of prep time - but that's just the tip of the iceberg with this book.  I enjoyed both the Hardcover and Kindle Editions and am very happy with both purchases.
B008CJ0KBU|4.0|everything was great except the case was busted which makes it hard to close.  would love one that wasnt cracked but otherwise great service
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Great movie.  Showing you that your not alone when it comes to difficult times in a partnership.  Looks at the sad times but leaves you with a feeling of hope too
B003JHKORK|5.0|I loved the books and this movie really brought back that feeling. Wish they would have made the rest of the books into movies!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I'm so happy that this game finally came to the android store:) I have this on my ipad and am addicted to it. Over all it's a fun game with being able to breed any two dragons you want to create a brand new one. It's diffrent from other games, because you can buy gems but you can also earn them by completing challanges. I would recomend this game to people of all ages.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the most epic game ever you have done amazing I have to give it to you Mojave notch and jeb
B000F8O35U|5.0|A great movie that my grand-daughter wanted so bad for her birthday. I bought it for her and it is going to be her birthday gift on Friday.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|It was not as funny as the commercials made it look; we were disapointed and did not enjoy watching it.
0679809015|1.0|It is a very small book. It can fit in your back pocket. It is a board book, so it would be better for small children
B003U6BE8I|3.0|I'm not going to take a lot of time with this.  The premise:  there is an elite group of kids running around the planet who are the offspring of the gods, Percy Jackson being one of them.  This is very light fluff, folks, and as such, it entertains in spite of it's very flimsy plot.  Yes, it's all very predictable fair.  The acting is just okay; no real stand-outs here.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Fantastic read! Great follow up to the 1st book. Kept my attention the entire book. The plot Climaxed at just the right time
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This was just a thoroughly enjoyable time.  Fun and full of action and some great acting and writing.  Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law made a great team.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very excited to read the entire saga. Very similar to &#34;50 shades of Grey&#34; trilogy however kept my attention a lot better
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Even if you think you dont like classical music this album will change your mind. My granddaughte plays cello after hearing Mr.  Nelson play she has practiced more and is saving up for an electric cello.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This story had me in butterflies, had me mad, happy, sad, excited, almost in tears & more. I was happy when Abby & Travis got together, mad when they split, sad when they didn't communicate & on edge when he fought.  The last fight had me clutching my chest from heart palpitations & then almost in tears. I was so glad when that ended. I will definitely be reading this story again. I'm sooooooo happy with how the book ended that I really didn't want it to end. I highly recommend this story for those who love a great love story.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Great movie and I love the fact that it can be watched with only the music of the film.  Great film!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|received much earlier than i expected! strongly recommended!<br />i loved this movie. and the music is wonderful. it is worth buying.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|I'm not a movie critic but I love Syfy movies. This movie is very slow at the start and the acting is just okay.
030758836X|5.0|The plot of GONE GIRL: A Novel by Gillian Flynn concerns a wife who disappears from her home in Mssouri while her husband is at work.  The details of this plot are covered elsewhere and most of those who are disappointed focus on the conclusion.  They hate it.  SInce most of these same critics say they enjoyed - even loved - the story that preceeded the 'ending', I have a hard time figuring out how they thought anything else was even possible much less more appropriate.  If you believed that a long term relationship (5 years+) was even possible between such disfunctional, dishonest, and even violent people the the ending is powered by the same logic and circumstance that kept them together through the part of the book those readers enjoyed. The idea that one partner could eventually accept, even enjoy, going back to living (for the rest of their days?) with a murderer who has also tried to send them to jail, makes perfect sense if you look at the forces that attracted and bound them for the duration of the first five years.  This couple had built a relationship on perverse motivations with twisted strategies for dealing with those motivations.  Of course any 'resolution' should be just as unconventional and bizarre.  What would have made these readers happy?  Should one of them just been taken to trial, convicted, and sentenced to jail.  If this 'normal' outcome makes sense, then this couple should have had a more 'normal' relationship to begin with; the book should have been  a more 'normal' mystery.  But the characters did not, and the book did not - so the conclusion should not have been 'normal'.  Perhaps even more significantly an ending that has these two weirdos ending up having to live with each other, depend on each other for companionship,  is so much more 'punishing' than simply sending them to jail or killing one off.  They got the life they deserved and the book had a twisted ending that was a logical - and appropriate -  outcome of that life.  [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]
B007DIQAXI|5.0|OMAM have made, IMO, one of the top ten albums of 2012. If you haven't yet listened to the album past Little Talks, do yourself a favor and, at a minimum, listen to Lakehouse, and Slow and Steady.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Thanks to all who reviewed this and the ridiculous add-on. I will NOT be purchasing this main app or the add-on. Especially since the integration between the two looks like it doesn't function properly anyway!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008J05EL8 OfficeSuite Font Package]][[ASIN:B0051UP5NQ OfficeSuite Professional 6]]
B000089A06|5.0|Great movie! I would recommend this movie if you like these movies! It arrived on time with no problems! I am satisfied
B008J05EL8|1.0|Thanks to all who reviewed this. I will NOT be purchasing the main app or this ridiculous add-on. Especially since the integration between the two looks like it doesn't function properly anyway!
B009IQG5M4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies so I'm thrilled to have it on Blu Ray!  It has so much depth and soul to it, bringing together women in the bond of friendship and family through life's happy and tragic times.  A classic \\"chick flick\\" that every woman should own but with so much more profundity than that phrase portrays!<br /><br />Two generations of Chinese women come together as June (Ming-Na Wen) is grieving over the death of her mother.  Her mother's three best friends, or aunties as June calls them, and their daughter's, have shared a lifetime of friendship that binds them together throughout the years and the milestones of life.  Weddings, funerals, births and tragedy shape their lives.<br /><br />We flash back and forth through the different women's stories of heartache and triumph.  There are a lot of tears and tragedy but the lows of their darkest hours make the highs of their victories felt so much more strongly.  I always appreciate this level of realness in a movie.  Some people only want to see happy but the reality is that's not how life works.  I feel like you can connect so much more strongly to a film when it has this element of truth.<br /><br />The struggle between mothers and daughters is a timeless one that no culture is exempt from.  These four \\"Americanized\\" daughters experience it even more strongly with the added complication of a Chinese culture rich in it's heritage and traditions.  The mother's hold onto the very traditions that the daughter's struggle to break free from.<br /><br />Laugh and cry and walk away feeling touched and enriched which is a rarity in any film.  Pick this up for the women on your list.  Mothers and daughters will love it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the first fiction book that I have read in a very long time.  Although I actually really listened to it on my kindle fire HD.  I read it with the professional narration, which was great.  I really enjoyed this book and the descriptions of the woods and the food and the symmetry between the characters in her life within and out of the games.  I look forward to the rest of the books, which I am told are also excellent.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love ThePianoGuys' music! I was so excited to get this for my birthday. I pre-ordered it, and it came just in time! I also love watching their videos on YouTube, I recommend their channel too!!
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Love chuch sorry it's gone this season was good but his mother and john coner's mother shouldn't be the same doesn't seem plosible
B002GHIPYI|4.0|pros: clean crisp highs that sound excellent, very comfortable for my head type, and I havent had any durability issues so its a decently tough pair of headphones.<br /><br />cons: highs can almost hurt to listen to at high volumes, mids and bass are lacking but solid for whats there.
B005FISBTO|2.0|Dexter Seasons 1-5 were cutting edge, inventive and down right shocking at times. I'm not sure what happened with Season 6.<br /><br />The plot of Season 6 starts out with so much potential and truly reels you in only to get bogged down in poorly written plot points and predictable resolutions half way through. For a show whose past season have made me gasp, Season 6 made me ask, \\"Really? How has this show become so predictable? None of this makes sense.\\"<br /><br />Let's hope Season 7 changes things around, but not feeling too bright right now.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I picked this up when it was the free deal of the day and I dont regret it. Its just like the card game and it keeps kids who like the game busy on the car rides. I know it says the kindle tablet edition but i used it on my Toshiba Thrive tablet without any problems. If you are looking for digital card games than you will want to pick this one up. Hope you have fun and dont forget.... UNO!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Got this for my brother for christams, he loves zombies and loves AMCs walking dead.  I got this to accompany the special edition season 1 dvds.  Great gift for all the Zombie lovers in your house!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My kids will even listen to this with me. My whole family loves it. It is fun to watch their youtube videos but the CD is awesome as well! We love it.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|Peter Cincotti has such a smooth voice that this album will sooth the even the worst day away.  I bought this for my Nana for christmas and she loves it!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Most writers don't dislike their protagonists, but you get the feeling that Serena is I.M.'s target for everything he doesn't like about women. While writing is expectedly lovely, descriptions detailed, the characters are all a little hard to like or even hate with I interest.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Got this for my brother for christams, he loves zombies and loves AMCs walking dead.  I got this to accompany the special edition season 2 zombie head.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|If you're a fan of director Wes Anderson, you're going to love this movie. Duh.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of Wes Anderson, you're going to dislike this movie. To each his own.<br /><br />If you don't know who Wes Anderson is, you'll like this movie as a whimsical look at the innocence of young love. Check it out!
B004V5A7K8|4.0|A great way to &#34; waste &#34; time while waiting in a doctor's office or elsewhere.<br />Reminds me of the days when video games first made an appearance. Many years ago ;)
B0035G5IOE|4.0|If you like author Roald Dahl, or director Wes Anderson, you'll love this movie. If you don't know who those people are, think of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (for the former), or The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (for the latter). Great family movie with a smart edge for adults.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|I think CC outdid themselves on this number, though this album may be a slightly unexpected turn from the norm for them. Although I enjoyed the music, and listened to it a few times, this album to me was not as engaging as I or even II. May just be the mode I was in though after waiting for a show of theirs only to be disappointed by an abrupt cancellation.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|For a movie that is clearly made to &#34;wow&#34; you with special effects and colorful settings, this is the ultimate tester of the quality of your home movie setup. Also, it is just a funny movie that can be great for all ages.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Like 50% of the reviewers here I am one of the unfortunates who received not one but two defective boxsets. Really a major disapointment that the greatest group of all time has to have their beautiful music butchered and released to their loyal fan base in such a shabby way. I have returned yet another boxset and will get a refund rather than put up with the hassel and aggravation. I realize there are far more pressing problems going on in the world today and I put this into proper perspective, but I was expecting just a little sunshine and joy from this long awaited vinyl reissue. Whomever was in charge of QA on this project needs to look for another occupation. My advice, as much as you may want this dont buy it. Send a message to the clowns at EMI.
B000W9DSVW|4.0|Great buy! I love all of these movies so it makes sense to own this set. If you love the Ocean's movies, this is obviously how you want to own it.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I went out and bought this after I saw it played on TableTop. It's easy to learn and tons of fun!
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|I honestly questioned if I would like this movie before seeing it. I mean it is a movie about the A's. If you aren't a baseball fan you may really question watching it. Even if you are a baseball fan you may question watching it. It is still the A's. This movie is awesome, though. One of my favorites in sports. It is up there with Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights. The movie feels a lot like The Social Network if you have seen it. Muted colors with some strong greens. Definitely check this out if you appreciate a good soundtrack, too. Very Friday Night Lights-ish.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I loved it, it will be a classic.  This movie will be one I hope my grandchildren enjoy.  This is me signing off.
B000077VOY|5.0|Product arrived in timely manner, and even though they were used. All the DVD's are in great shape.  I had been looking for these for several years, as I had purchased the whole series of Thunderbirds. This sparked memories of this series.  I told my husband when they arrived, that I'd be in front of the T.V. set with my bowl of cereal, re- living Saturday Morning cartoons... although these are not cartoons, but they were part of my Saturday Morning cartoon favorites.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like it, but after about 10 or so boards it gets a little boring. Over all good app. ****
B0011Z8S8E|5.0|In Tracy Chapman's 1988 album named Tracy Chapman, the album consists of highly sentimental, political, and controversial themes that made her music a good reflection of the eighties atmosphere.  The most popular song in Tracy Chapman is Fast Car.  It has a wide audience because it speaks of economic struggles in a manner that allows for introspection and not just pity.  The simple but mesmerizing classic guitar chord throughout most of her songs brought out a grassroots type of feeling.  It is very personal and therefore relatable.  In Across the Lines, the subject is about the borders between White and Black Americans and speaks of the ever present racial misunderstanding between both races.  She starts by making the line of separation apparent through \\"Across the lines/Who would dare to go?/Under the bridge/Over the tracks/That separate whites from blacks\\" singing about the true American reality.  This is also another inequity found in the U.S.  The feelings of discrimination are made apparent through song.  \\"Why do the babies starve when there is enough food to feed the world?/Why when there are millions of us are there people still alone?\\" are powerful lyrics that ask questions that make the listener think about the true state of the Earth.  Chapman's ability to amplify her message in each song is because of the unique tone in her voice.  It is naturally genuine and it mixes in perfectly with the real life situation lyrics.  Although her voice is plain it fills the spaces because it remains so true to itself by not changing.  It is riveting because what Tracy Chapman sings about is true and in some ways very depressive but that is what gives this album an authenticity many artists never reach.  She expresses the hard news in life and includes none of the frivolous, superficial and distracting aspects of American life.
B008OOYALE|4.0|it is a good creative challenge the part I don't like is you have to wait a long time for things
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Love this book. A must read for case interviews. Do read Case in Point before reading this and Wetfeets Ace the Case
B008J34466|4.0|I didn't LOVE the songs immediately, but the more I listened, the more I liked.  In typical Pink fashion - the songs are catchy but there is more than just surface appeal.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Everybody in the family enjoys the game.  It's very challenging.  I usually play for a long time after the children go to bed.<br />I love it!!!
B005LAIHQS|1.0|if you like gore buy this movie.I dont and will never buy any more mib movies.It is a terrible movie.I watched about 30 minutes and shut it down.If you have small children this is not a movie to let them watch.I was terribly disapointed.I liked the first one.I will give it away.It does not even deserive one star.Inez
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I own every Christina cd and have been through her hits and flops. Honestly, I didn't expect much from this album because she has done everything. However, Lotus has such an upbeat mood and you just want to dance. In my opinion, the best tracks are &#34;Red Hot Kinda Love,&#34; &#34;Your Body,&#34; &#34;Let There Be Love,&#34; &#34;Just a Fool,&#34; and &#34;Best of Me.&#34;I even like the immature, curse word laced &#34;Circles.'&#34; The intro is beautiful too. &#34;Army of Me&#34; is kind of stupid, dubbed 'Fighter2.0'.. I liked the original song &#34;Fighter&#34; 1000x better. Overall, this Cd holds its own and isn't really comparable to any of her previous albums. The mood is very young and fresh. Great buy :-)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Choose it for an easy read and got so much more... this book kept me on the edge of my seat. I hated to put it down!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Lovely album. You guys have so much talent which is rare in this day and age. keep up the good work.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Fun and addictive.  I would recommend this game because once you start, it ishard to but away. Each level is very good at keeping. you enthralled.
B00992CF6W|5.0|to me if your life is not so great play this game cause it is like a new life in this game
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Best show I ve ever watched plus its based in NM where I'm from and I personally know a few of the actors
B0050KEVO6|1.0|i THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD GAME.  NOT SO, VERY BORING. i HAVE DELETED IT FROM MY APPS. SORRY
B009F879HK|5.0|I have always been an avid Beatles fan.  I have some of their old albums issued on Capitol that are monophonic.  I have an old Love Me Do 45 (American type with the large center hole), but have always wanted this version for my collection.  Quality is excellent and the vinyl, label and sleeve are very accurate reproductions overall.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|Fantastic performance from one of the greatest songwriters today.  Some great covers as well. Wish there was more camera shots from away.  Too many neck and above shots. Small point though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this was free so I bought it and glad I did. its easy to start and keeps u into it....great game!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The raw, pure talent of these two is incredible. I use it as study music because it is lyric-less but not as insane and intense as like Mozart.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|An extremely wide variety of music and videos . . . old and new. Pass it own, download now you will not regret it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The whole family loves to listen to the Piano Guys. Especially my daughter who is learning to play the piano.
B000000W3G|5.0|This is great box set that will bring back great memories from the past.<br /><br />I will rate this 5 stars!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I purchased this book on my kindle after reading the good reviews on Amazon.  I am an avid reader and enjoy a variety of genres.  What I enjoyed most about this book was all of the churning my brain was doing trying to figure out WHO is the protagonist in the book!  Strangely enough, I didn't LIKE any of the characters, but that didn't really matter - I wanted to know what was going to happen to these people.<br />The book is written from the point of view of the husband and wife (in diary format in the first part of the book).  The author does a good job of making you dislike a character for a chapter (hence, making you like another) and then flipping it around in the next chapter.  You never quite know who you are &#34;rooting for&#34;.  Love that angle.<br />SPOILER (don't read unless you want to know part of the ending):  Unlike others, I really like how the book ended.  I thought those two messed up people deserved each other.  Strangely, I liked that the wife didn't go to jail for murder (heck, that happens in every book - this one was different!), but they each got some of their own punishment by being together.  I think the kid will likely be messed up too.  Good thing it is a book! haha!
B003B17YZE|5.0|This is such a great CD this is my favorite by Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />I would give this a 5 star rating!!!!!!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love love this series, it gets better and better every year, the bonuses on the dvd's are worth every bit.
0399159029|5.0|I very much enjoyed this novel, although I didn't find it as strong as some of the other entries in the series. Still and all, well worth the read.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|the fights were so good i want to watch this again should have bought the movie...i think ill do that
B008YWY0HK|4.0|While this falls into my second tier of pixar movies, it's still better than most. Good viewing for the whole family.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|They have a interesting take on many new songs that sound amazing!! I could listen to this cd on repeat all day! I definitely highly recommend it!
B001NFNFIK|3.0|I enjoyed the film version of Heaven's Prisoners, but this was muddled. Take a pass and read the book. The cast is good, but the story is wanting.
B0091REZMW|5.0|My idea is then at well this games is OK I mean it's not that good if what they say it's amazing but then when u play with it it's just boring
B005LAIHY0|5.0|With expectations this high, people were going to be dissapointed. But I was not one of them. I almost like it better than the original. Can't recommend it highly enough!
B0097GTUCC|1.0|Read all the hype beforehand and have always been a fan of Duff. Loved his book.<br />Was really expecting this to be something. Bestbuy doesn't even carry this so I had to spend 16 bucks for it. One, maybe 2 good tracks, the rest don't do anything for me. Sounds like it was thrown together to meet a contractual obligation.  Send me 10 bucks and you can have my copy.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It doesn't play as fast some that I've played, but it is really good game, I would recommend to others.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I loved the old Bubble popper games when i was younger, this game doesnt quite have the charm as those did but its still a decent game. My main issue with the game is the font which is terrible.<br /><br />I can easily see myself playing this game when i am bored.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is one of the best trilogies ever made so don't waste any more time and get this now!!! The only thing I don't like about this set is that it comes with ultra violet...and i HATE ultra violet. Just give me a digital copy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome. I love playing minecraft. it is one of my favorite games and I'm sure you will like it too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is fantastic! I loved the series and the action and the sexiness of this book. These books are a fast, exciting read!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Mark Watney is one of the most engaging characters I've had the pleasure to read in a very long time.  This is an amazing book.  I have no idea how technically accurate it is, and I could care less.  The author (bless you Mr. Weir) created a never say die character with an awesome sense of comedic timing. :)  There is a bit of profanity in the book.  Guess what, real people, they curse when in stressful, life-threatening and/or unexpected situations.  I read, a LOT.  The dialogue in this book was done very well.  Especially considering the gentlemen was alone, on Mars, with ZERO communication with anyone for the vast majority of the book.  Freaking great book.  Can't say it enough.  Very well done Andy Weir!
B002U1F32M|5.0|Zooey and JGL are great together, extremely beilivable because there's not a happy ever after. The soundtrack is great too!
B009HELT3C|2.0|Average movie, Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's 90. Josh Brolin and Will Smith were both good. Story was a bit convoluted
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Abe Lincoln..the man who is on as much US currency (Penny & $5) as Washington (quarter, & $1) because his presidency meant that much to this country in it's total scope, not just the slavery issue.<br /><br />Now this man's name and rise to presidency has been turned into a very pathetic Vampire movie?!  Someone ( or more than one) please do the following for me in no particular order...<br /><br />***(please take this as metaphorical, not real - ok?  Geez, I even have to put in a \\"warning label\\" for a movie review since the world has gone completely off its rocker with all this PC crap and all the other stupidity encompassing what passes for entertaiment these days on TV or at the movies.  Also the ridiculous over-sensitivity about everything that never even entered anyone's mind during the majority of my 50+ years of being alive)***  With that out of the way...<br /><br />Slap the person(s) who wrote this story, slap the person(s) who thought this was a good idea, slap the person(s) who liked it at the production level before it was even started to be filmed, slap the person(s) who paid for the production, slap the person who chose to direct this, slap all the actors who got paid to be in it (and many of the actors are actors I really like and respect), Give a pat on the back to all the persons involved in the production design and special FX, slap every single person who paid the movie theater price to see this film. I've already smacked myself in the head several times while watching a rental of this movie for paying $3.99 to rent it out of sheer morbid curiosity.<br /><br />While this movie is certainly a well budgeted production - I rank it up (or should that be down) there with movies like Bad Taste (and look who directed that turd of a film from New Zealand and how far he -and the whole country- has come in the movie business since 1988) as a movie that serves no purpose other than to disgrace the name of a president who was very WORTHWHILE and SIGNIFICANT.<br /><br />Why couldn't they have switched presidents to Barrack Obama as the vampire slayer.  He's been scaring the crap out of me since his first election to this countris highest office.  I'd have an easier time believing that killing vampires is what he's really doing than believe he has anything to do with running this country other than into the ground even further than the other presidents before him.

B008LZHA3G|3.0|Since buying this cd I have not yet been able to burn this on any computer for iTunes yet without hearing skipping in some tracks. Not sure if it is a production issue, but even playing direct from the cd is poor quality. Not a dirty cd, and have tried on three computers then gave up
0060254920|5.0|This is definitely one of the best kids books of all time.  The story is whimsical and fun and the illustrations are gorgeous.  It is now and will always be a classic.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I couldn't wait for this CD to come out - these guys are able to take songs on the radio which are only so-so and turn them into something simply incredible!  What depth of sound and feeling!  Peponi?  \\"Paradise\\" made better!  \\"Code Name Vivaldi\\" - This one is meant to be played over and over again!  And \\"What Makes you Beautiful\\" IS beautiful!
0142403873|5.0|I love this book almost as much as my son.  It is simply adorable and fun to read.  This one is a future classic.  You must also check out the movie as it is fantastic!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Greatest movie with combined reality & animation ever produced.  Even had a redeeming plot. Get it; it's a classic.  Avatar
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Okay, we're huge Star Wars fans in our house so we had to buy the complete set as soon as it came out on Blu-ray.  Bad thing is that the original cuts are no longer available.  It makes me want to scream to see Jabba talking to Han Solo near the Falcon - wrong!
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I watched this with my grandma and she was even laughing at the raunchy humor, but unless your grandma is awesome, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with her even remotely close to her.  This is a great quality product.  It is definitely well worth the money.  The seller made sure the item was processed and shipped very quickly!
0142407542|5.0|This is a really fantastic book and sequel to the original Gruffalo.  No doubt these two books are going to be future classics.

B004LWZWGK|2.0|i have always been a batman fan. even the first 2 in this series i liked. but this last installment i am glad to say was a fitting end. this movie to me sucked. from start to finish. the only thing i liked was the action sequences. the rest of it was so far displaced from any kind of originality of batman was insulting. i bought the blue-ray, and am very sorry i did.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I originally bought this for my preschool granddaughter to play.  I'm not sure at this point what age range was given, but it is too advanced for my granddaughter. However, I certainly enjoy it!  My daughter also swipes my Kindle Fire  whenever she's over and plays it.
B000BTGY7I|4.0|Although this isn't the best or funniest movie I've ever seen, it is definitely worth a watch and a purchase at a reasonable price.  Brad Pitt's character Mickey makes the movie memorable.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I loved the new album!  I have to say, though, I love your music best in combination with the videos!  The combination takes my breath away..... Keep on playing guys!
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|I really enjoyed this film \\"Ted\\", of course it's funny, but I also think that it could've been better..... Other than that it's a descent film
B0067R0APK|5.0|I'm so glad I shelled out the extra 99c for the ad-free version. Worth every cent. Had already learnt to prefer Accuweather over my previous weather apps, for it crisper graphics, easy customization and handy links to radar/news videos. Really like how this version links your favourite location's current weather and temp to your homepage toolbar. Nice. Updates well and with this app I never get 'unavailable service/status' issues.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  It was recommended by a friend and was a wonderful read.  I escaped into this novel and<br />was surprised by the ending, which is not usual.  I am an avid fan of detective, mystery novels and true crime and enjoy<br />figuring them out.  I recommend this one highly!
B004LWZW42|2.0|They really need to make villians like Apocalype and Mr Sinister in these and stop cutting corners with the whole budget saving &#34;guy in lounge suit or funny outfit&#34; thing. All these X-men movies had potential but fell so short. Some aspects to this one were good... Fassbender's performance for one. Most the rest not so... casting for just about every other role in this movie and the the inconsistency to the comics (Alex older than Scott, Beast gets Blue from Mystique's blood, yeah, seriously ???). The comics were fertile ground for a closer translation... lots of good material over the years.

B00846REIS|5.0|I can not wait to see the Movie...I loved that is seems to be more realistic and easy to relate to.
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|Giants, ogres, werewolves, Frankenstein, Mulan, Captain Hook ... what do all the things have in common?  Once Upon a Time Season Two, that's what!  This is the series that has single-handedly changed the face of television fantasy and made ABC a major player in creative, prime-time entertainment.<br /><br />This show has almost limitless possibilities and (at the writing of this review) is creatively satisfying the potential of an ever-expanding setting while maintaining continuity with previous episodes.  To date Once Upon still hasn't sold out to the prevailing model of dark/edgy/gritty, a thematic bandwagon I'm so sick of I could literally hurl, and more importantly they stick with the main characters from season one, continuing to develop them in a huge way (e.g. the welcome \\"manning up\\" of Charming) while constantly introducing new ones.<br /><br />Also, I've sort of come to expect sub-standard or straight-up cheesy FX from television as a given and this is where Once Upon just continues to amaze me.  What I really find astonishing is when I hear other people actually labeling the CG as bad... I guess I just don't get it.  I mean if we see a dragon on TV we already know it's not real; we just hope it's convincing enough to maintain the illusion that the events we're watching might actually be taking place somewhere... out there.  I say kudos to the producers for their frugal reliance on CG which is inherently a technology always one step ahead of being outdated and overly scrutinized as more people become fluent in graphics tech.  In other words, too many people know how the trick is done to maintain the illusion if it's the only trick up the sleeve, so to speak, and so I guess it's a good thing that Once Upon excels in the areas of camera-work (including green-screen), costumes, sets, lighting, makeup, fighting and action choreography.<br /><br />This is a bigger season with more action, lots of unexpected and clever plot twists, new realms and more fantasy than season one with just enough added drama to enhance adult appeal without detracting from the original premise; less emphasis on Emma, spotlight on Charming and Snow as their characters are reinvigorated, less of Henry, much more of The Dark One (i.e. Mr. Gold), sllightly less screen-time for the Evil Queen as new dangers and villains are introduced and based on the way this series is gaining momentum, I'd predict it may very well be a five year run because it just \\"feels\\" like the writers, producers, actors etc. actually enjoy what they're doing.  :o)an season one with just enough added drama to enhance adult appeal without detracting from the original premise; less emphasis on Emma, spotlight on Charming and Snow as their characters are reinvigorated, less of Henry, much more of The Dark One (i.e. Mr. Gold), sllightly less screen-time for the Evil Queen as new dangers and villains are introduced and based on the way this series is gaining momentum, I'd predict it may very well be a five year run because it just \\"feels\\" like the writers, producers, actors etc. actually enjoy what they're doing.  :o)

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Top quality music skillfully spanning so many genres. The Piano Guys have been awesome on Youtube, and blasting this CD at full quality on good speakers is audio nirvana.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read about a book per week and quickly forget my last book as I delve into my new pick.  However, Wool is one to remember. Not only was I enthralled with the story, it made me rediscover my love of sci-fi. Highly recommended.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book is well written . The subject matter is compelling and heartbreaking.<br />It is absolutely a page turner. I found myself &#34;haunted&#34; by the topic and thinking about it long after I finished the book.<br />I highly recommend it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's a fun way to give my brain a rest from stress! The game tends to get &quot;bogged&quot; down and slow at times, but it's rather minor.
B0086700CM|5.0|Well... It goes on forever until you die and you jump, slide and trip over obstacles. Just don't let those weird monkeys get you! I really love this game and so will you.
1579129129|5.0|It's a lovely book with very clear pictures.  It has skull pictures of fish, birds and mammals of all kinds. Sometime an entire skeleton is pictured.  I think  it's a wonderful book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What more can I say?! With technology changing like Seasons, depending on what latest gadget you have, one will always run and quicker better than the other. This app is fine to me. It lets me view, pin and like. Only thing my Fire doesn't let me do is give me a option to Pin a photo I'm viewing when ever a image is displayed. Other than that, happy pinning! :)
B000026C3T|5.0|Recently uploading a huge batch of music,it has been interesting to listen to music in ear buds.A experience most younger people take for granted, but to a young man who enjoyed the sixties through to the present mostly through speakers it is way to easy to come across recordings.that leave allot to be desired.<br />This group of remasters however does not disappoint.,and is far superior to the original issues of their lps on disk.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I was listening to and watching the Piano Guys long before they made a name for themselves as geniuses in the classical/pop/rock/whatever world. They have a little something for anybody that loves music. This album is only the third CD I've ever bought (one of the others was their YouTube Hits CD). Excellent set of music that I can listen to constantly!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|be ready to get addicted to this app. play many times a day. glad it was free. only drawback is having to pay for more coins.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Much better than the stock bulb, but not nearly as great as the TerraLux Ministar2.<br /><br />I bought it mainly for the switch, since I didn't want an IQ switch after reading the reviews.  I've been using the switch with the TerraLux, and it's worked well.  It doesn't have a &#34;click&#34; when pushed on or off, but that doesn't affect the functionality, which is much better than having to twist to turn the light on.
B0091XRL86|5.0|It was funny and the kids loved it. It was also clean and taught some good lessons and we're pretty pleased.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|From Story to Special Effects this movie does an excellent job of gathering the Marvel Heroes that make up the world saving team of the movie's title.  Really can't be compared to the solo movies, which in my opinion, except Iron Man, were mostly average movies.  In fact several characters were much improved by this joint effort.  I think everyone agrees that Mark Ruffalo is the best Bruce Banner since ink and paper.  Another highlight is Scarlet Johansson's portrayal of The Black Widow, she deserves a chance at a leading role.  Great to see such an excellent addition to the feathers in Joss Whedon's hat.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Wow, what an orchestra!!!!  The sound track equals, or exceeds, the quality of the filming and editing.  Which says a lot, because it's a GREAT movie as well.  John Williams and the Chicago Symphony ... what else could you want for a movie sound track?  Bravo!
B004SIP8OI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino what more needs to be said? Kill Bill is awesome in both scope, direction, art, writing and effects.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved the whole series, but thought the hero and heroine should have been treated better after winning the Hunger Games - at least for a little while.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|This is a great app for my android tablet but I had to uninstall this and reinstall it several times because it just stopped working. Not sure why this is has happend and if it keeps on happening I will probably stop using. I do enjoy the ease of use and how fast I get the books. I also love the selection it is one of the biggest I have found. Overall not too bad hopefully I have stopped the issues and will love this app in the future.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Wow, I was really skeptical when I saw this was such a low price. 18 dollars???? But, all three dvds worked perfectly, and it came in this cool holographic case that changed depending on how you looked at it([...])    If you love the movies, but dont care about collectors edition, or anything like that, then buy this. Extremely good deal and also comes with a cool little picture book on how they made the movie.
1781163243|5.0|The concept and finished artwork is absolutely stunning in this book. Details in the CG can easily be missed when playing the game, but this book captures every stunning detail up-close.
B000FC0ZAI|5.0|Like so many others, I bought The Cloud Atlas thinking it was Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />It is not.<br /><br />I've never been so happy to make a mistake before.<br /><br />The Cloud Atlas is beautifully written. I was sucked in right away, and couldn't stop reading this haunting tale about war, love, loss, faith, and balloons.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham is a master.  I love his stories and the legal plots.  Highly entertaining.  I could hardly put the book down.
0553385461|5.0|This book explains the beginning of the universe (the big bang) with even more concision and understanding (for a layman) than the original, \\"A Brief History of Time.\\" \\"Even if there were events before the big bang, we could not use them to determine what would happen afterward, because predictability would have broken down at the big bang. Correspondingly, if as is the case, we know only what has happened since the big bang, we cannot determine what happened beforehand. As far as we are concerned, events before the big bang can have no consequences and so should not form part of a scientific model of the universe. We should therefore cut them out of the model and say that the big bang was the beginning of time.\\"
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am always excited about a new Grisham book.  I have read all of them and this one is just as action packed and thought provoking as all of them have been.  I know that I was very surprised by the ending.  I did not expect it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This version is great! Very user friendly! I can keep my boards way more organized now with the app for some reason
B004SRWW0C|5.0|I haven't been too happy with stock file browsers, but this one is dead-simple to use, quick and efficient.  No goofy interfaces or loads of useless functions here, it just allows you to get to stored files easily, move them around, whatever you need.  Buy it, it's well worth it!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Sometimes it is a little laggy.. and sometimes when viewing peoples profiles it wont let you scroll down.. it just stays at their top timeline photo
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This is a must-have, Wainwright at the top of his game.  His other music is fantastic, but this disc always keeps me coming back to it.  'Go Or Go Ahead' is the peak of this album, in my opinion. It may take a few listens for you to get into the whole CD but it's well worth the time and you'll love it forever.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|This is what i play when i am waiting on words with friends lol. I would recommend this to friends and family also.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Watched it in the theater and it was so good that we just had to have it for watching at home. Good family fun.
B000002UDV|5.0|Greatest concept album of the sixties, maybe even of the twentieth century!  Beach Boys only sing on top of a dozen or more Hollywood studio musicians directed by Brian Wilson.  The inspiration for Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by the Beatles.
1439102430|3.0|This was the first Kathy Reichs story I've read, and the story was intriguing.  However, for my personal taste, I was hoping for something with more feeling and emotion and more character development.  The story was very technical and admittedly, a lot of it was over my head.  It was interesting and I found myself drawn into the story, wanting to know what happened next, but so much of the terminology had me confused.  I think this book would appeal more to CSI buffs or at least people who have a bit more background in the subject than I do.  A good book, just out of my comfort zone and different from my usual so it threw me.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you enjoy puzzles this is a great app.  It runs smoothly and you can decide the number of pieces you want to work with.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was not expecting much when I got this book.  To tell you the truth, after reading the Fifty Shades trilogy and Bared to You, I was feeling a little burned out from this genre.  But this book was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />What I liked was that the sex descriptions were kept to a minumum.  There was an actual story here, much moreso than in 50 Shades and even in Bared to You.  More is revealed about Gideon and Eva's pasts.  The first 20 or 30 pages were a little slow, but after that I couldn't put this book down. There is a great plot twist at the end, and while some of the twists and turns were predictable, some were unexpected (at least for me).<br /><br />The only thing that kept this from being a 5 star book, in my opinion, was the fact that Gideon is an unrealistic character.  Being one of the richest men in the world at the age of 28.  But then again, if this book were about everyday, middle class people it probably wouldn't \\"work.\\"<br /><br />The best book thus far that I've read in this genre, and excited for her next book!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Honestly it is a shame it is entertaining but lacks the spark of it's predecessors I & iI. I really like this sequel and it was written and directed well but it left you waiting for more action at times. Maybe I expected too much or missed Tommy Lee Jones playing his full role as K but Josh Brolin did an excellent job playing K of the past with excellent K&#34;ish&#34; quips and cuts.Everyone looked a little tired I guess that comes with age and the down fall of making 3rd sequels did not leave out MIB III.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down until I was done with the book. Only complaint...there are only three books in the series.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I could listen to music from the Piano Guys all day every day (and I do, quite frequently). They take classical music (which is already beautiful) and make it phenomenal and they take modern music and make it astounding. My personal favorite is the Titanium/Pavanne mash-up. They're so enthusiastic about their music and put so much joy into it that the music is truly out of this world.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Thin Plot line, Eye candy for the girls. For me the story line was weak. While the main character had some great moves I feel the whole movie was overrated .
B00190OHD6|5.0|I'm just a sucker for romantic comedies and this had it all.  This is a movie I would buy and watch over and over when I had the time.  It's a feel good movie, although the story is sad, it does have a great ending.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Works great, which is what I would expect from the folks at Plex. I love Plex and how easy it makes organizing and accessing my home video library. This app looks and works pretty much the same as any of the other Plex clients. Not quite as polished as the Roku app but all the basics are there to allow you to stream your movies over your home network with just a few taps. Video  looks great on my Samsung Note 2. Would definitely recommend getting this if you have Plex media server running on your home PC. Haven't tested over 3G/4G.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|Loved this, all round! Perhaps not as much as Books 1 & 2, but still a wonderfully written book which kept me enjoying not just the plot but the language and style right up until the end.
1589944607|5.0|Let me start off by saying that you don't have to have seen the series to enjoy this board game, not all of my roommates have seen the series but they love playing this game none-the-less.  If you are a fan of the series you will be amazed at how accurately the board games emulates the events in the series AND the atmosphere of suspicion and politics.  So where to begin...<br /><br />This game has everything you could want for in a board game: action, strategy, suspense, cunning, teamwork, the list goes on.  Without a doubt it is my friends/roommates and my favorite board game we've ever played (and we've played maaany).  You DO have to have the patience to be willing to play a single game for three hours, if you can't do that then this game isn't for you.  The first few games may take five or so hours to play as you are learning the complex rules but you will catch on pretty quickly and it will mostly become second nature.<br /><br />Even after having played it more than thirty times in the past few years we still love the game.  We recommend the expansions as they expand upon some elements in the original game and provide slightly better balance; Pegasus was good but Exodus is where the game really shines.  If you are really dedicated you can find some rules variations online that tweak the game even further.  Given the fact that you can grab all three games on Amazon for 100 and it is one of the best bangs for your entertainment buck that you can get.  Next crisis!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Some books are so good you just have to share your enthusiasm, and Wool is no exception. Even with 2500+ reviews and counting, I've got put in my two cents because this book is fantastic! If you're completely new to the Wool series, start here first. The Shift novels are prequels, but they're not completely separate from the Wool storyline. You'll enjoy them either way, but I think books like this are more fun when you have to work for the reveal.<br /><br />I didn't expect much from Wool at first, since dystopian novels tend to be very hit or miss for me. But it blew me away. I'm sure there are many folks who can explain the plot better than me without spoiling it, so I'll leave that to them. I want to spotlight Hugh Howey's skill as an author. First, the characters practically leap off the page. They each have their own voices, complexities, and contradicting motivations. The romantic portions flowed naturally from the story--there was no lightning strike, love at first sight moment shoehorned in the middle of an unrelated scene. Secondly, this is a book for smart readers! Howey doesn't spoon feed you anything. You have to pay attention and put the pieces together. And the big reveal raises as many questions as it answers, which makes it more fun. Finally, the cliffhangers leading into subsequent books are organic and flow with the storyline--Howey doesn't write sequels for the sake of having a sequel.<br /><br />Bottom line--give this series a chance! It's one of the best books I've read, period. And there's culpability to be had on the part of the villains and the victims--it's not black and white, and really makes you think and compare this to our world today, which is one of the hallmarks of a great book.
0743216458|5.0|I would advise any WWII history buffs to read this to get a better idea of the comaraderie that prevailed throughout the theaters of wars. Very well written by Mr. Ambrose, whose PBS documentaries are always first rate.
B004SBULWE|4.0|I like this to kill apps that I don't even know are running in the backround, only think is sometimes my phone freezes when I'm using it.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Action packed and funny at the same time. Unbelievable story line but this is a bang bang shoot-em up action flick that does not dissapoint.
0571195121|4.0|Very good service and the expected edition. I've not seen it yet, i've to wait a few days. I'm travelling
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|One if Bruce Willis' bet movies yet. Absolutelty love to watch this one, especially at the end of a long bad day. Would recommend for just about anyone, not too child friendly though. Definitely worth purchasing even if you've never seen it before.
B002ZG9774|4.0|This is one of those movies that my wife would watch day after day. I don't mind it myself, Christina A. is in the best shape of her life. She sings her butt off & there's lots of eye candy.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great for many ages! Excellent family movie, though there is some violence so I would probably say it's better fir ages six? and up depending on the child.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|We wanted to like this film...we really did, but it was a complete waste of time!  Yes, there were a few minutes of dancing that most women would appreciate, but those few minutes were the only thing interesting about the entire film. Any storyline was virtually nonexistent and Matthew McConaughey was downright creepy!
B001DZ9GRE|4.0|Had the missing Eurythmics music videos from my collection - very nice. Been looking for this for a number of years.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My family can't get enough of this movie. Great storyline, fantastic animation, a soundtrack that will have you singing it all the time. This is amazing on Bluray on our 65&#34; Panasonic through the Bose surround sound. If you are looking for a kid-friendly movie that you won't have issues letting them watch daily (like most 2 year olds do) or more often, then this is the movie for you. Highly recommend to all audiences.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is wonderful; some of their best songs are on this album. I definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys classical and pop music.
0547848412|4.0|This film tie-in edition (film soon to be released in cinemas), is a real page-turning, absorbing narrative and a wonderful story to loose yourself within. Inspirational, touching and totally moving `The life of PI' tugs at the heartstrings of human emotion and alters your entire outlook on life itself. This is a tale that will leave you breathless, making you contemplate afterwards and think about those powerful words that you have just read. It is absolutely stunning and totally brilliant, with every page offering something different about humanity, electric tension, surprise and even ecstasy that is brimming full of emotion. It is so fresh and new that I couldn't compare it to anything else nor another author, for Yann Martel's writing style is just so individualistic and distinctive.<br /><br />The Life of PI is about a boy, a boat and a Tiger. You plunge head first into the dramatic aftermath of when a great Cargo ship sinks and only a solitary, miniscule lifeboat remains bobbing in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The only survivors of this incident are a young boy called PI, a Zebra with a broken leg, a Hyena, a female Orangutan and a four hundred and fifty pound Bengal tiger (which is the central focus of this tale in regards to noticeable symbolism).  One follows the Oceanic wonderings of this young boy and those wild animals, with his voyage to Canada. In the midst of his travels the animals end up slaughtering one another with such cannibalism and a veritable frenzy of allegorical bloodlust, so that PI and the Tiger are left together reflecting upon the meaning of life. Wondering the wastes of the Ocean they ponder about their fate, God's intended meaning for them whilst enduring raging storms and figuring out how to survive...<br /><br />Yann Martel spent many long years in Alaska, India, Mexico, France, Costa Rica, Turkey and Iran, before settling in Canada and so put his experiences of various different cultures within this work. The realism and exacting authenticity of atmospheric prose is exceptional, and which the author really brings vividly and clearly to life. This spicy, vibrant and cultural piece of fiction is full of tantalizing delights that are just as exciting as if you were traveling the world yourself, embarking on the greatest adventure of a lifetime. It is totally uplifting and an extraordinary tale that brings your wildest dreams alive, with such clarity and originality as to astonish. This extraordinary tale is full of engaging characterization and such detailed descriptions that enliven and enrich the tale of hope and aspirations.<br /><br />I would say that this bewitching book is sure to be universally loved and which deserves the title of a `modern classic', being something that would stand the test of time by being re-read in fifty or more years and remain just as relevant. Philosophical and playful, the enchanting narrative captures your heart and soul as you prepare to be taken on a rollercoaster of a ride into the unknown where you will explore the unbelievable and delve into the depths of reality.<br /><br />This deserves no less than a 4  star rating.<br /><br />(Almost 5 except for the slightly simplistic storyline- where perhaps something ELSE could have taken place too, thus heightening it even more).ng authenticity of atmospheric prose is exceptional, and which the author really brings vividly and clearly to life.

B00000IQW5|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies, I will watch it again and again!!!!  One of the best chick flix ever!
B006OKOZGU|5.0|I've been watching To Catch a Thief since I was a little girl. With the switch from VHS to DVDs<br />I neglected to replace it, so I'm making up for that mistake now. It's such a beautiful movie, and<br />it's even better in Blu-ray.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I absolutely lovee shazam because it works so quickly and efficiently. There is no other product that can give you the song title and artist as fast!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I bought this for my mother, but I may have to steal it from her if I keep hearing all of<br />these songs that I like. It's a pretty good album, and I like how Taylor is trying new things.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|My little Brother is a Big Fan of 3 Doors Down so when he enlisted in the USMC and shipped over to Japan I bought him this Cd.<br />He loves it and is jamming out to it whenever he gets Down.<br /><br />it was very fast to arrive and was in great condition upon arriving.
0783240236|5.0|This is a really good movie. It's very interesting and visually nice to watch! I'm glad I picked<br />it up, although with Hitchcock you can't really go wrong.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are simply amazing.  They are some of the most cutting edge, technologically adept and inspirational musicians that I've heard and seen in decades. I've listened to most of these tracks on YouTube and plan to buy the album for Christmas, both for myself and for gifts.  You should too!
B008N1V11U|5.0|this app is great I love it so much it is great and fun. I would buy it again and if it still cost $0.99 it is a steal
B009329ZF2|5.0|I am a nice, middle aged woman but this is a movie that is full of fun and some heart-string tugging.  I actually visited Pearl Harbor many times before the Missouri was permanently docked there and the part with the &#34;real&#34; battleship was awesome!  A real &#34;get her done&#34; moment!  Otherwise, the story line was very clever, the actors were terrific and the homage to the game &#34;Battleship&#34; was cleverly intertwined.  I would completely recommend it.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|This game is free for all other smartphones and tablets except Kindle Fire HD.  Amazon asked us to purchase this suppose to be free App with $2.99.  Well, I don't like the charge, but comparing the desperation of playing this game, 3 bucks is not a very big issue.  So, I decided to spent my money on it.<br />The game itself is pretty good, but it is not finished.  The stages after 3-20 (Hoth) was not coming out yet.  But this is not why I give it one star.  I skip Hoth to the next level, JEDI training, and completed the first stage.  When I tried to play the second stage, the message came out, &#34;PAY $1.99 or get 3 stars on all stages.&#34;  What a greedy company!! That's the thing really pissed me off.<br />I don't think I want to play this game anymore, and I will not purchase anymore angry bird game app.  Further more, I really don't like Amazon charged us for free game.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this game but I LOVE it! I love how you can change the amount of pieces each puzzle is. it is wicked fun!
B005XN31LY|5.0|great spin , and wonderful how they make all the fairy tales intertwined. Must see tv for our household. bravo
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easy to follow and lots of settings.  Could come with more default alarm tones but i like the snooze options.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following The Piano Guys a while now a YouTube, and it's great to listen to some incredible music from true and inspiring talent.  This album is exactly what is seen on YouTube, just awesome!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This one tops my list of Men in Black films all of which are praiseworthy for the tongue-in-cheek, sci-fi comedy, neo-classic spoof genre. Which MIB largely created. We expect a certain continuity of MIB elements, but this one has a whole lot of unexpected nuances.  I'm a sucker for any plot that delivers time travel in a novel way and MIB III does not disappoint!<br /><br />\\"K\\" (Tommy Lee Jones)is taken back in time to a former self portrayed in an outstandingly believable parody of Tommy Lee Jones' younger self by actor James Brolin.  This chaotic uncertainty is all, of course, in order to preserve the right outcomes and perfect the not-so-right outcomes. Besides saving the world, \\"K\\" must defeat a formidable alien opponent but is assisted by an equally formidable and somewhat kooky, soothsayer alien.<br /><br />And what would Men in Black be without the ever-cool and comic \\"J\\" (Will Smith) who also has to jump back in time without knowing how anything will turn out! His presence is absolutely required both in plot and in cast. This one is truly worthy of the MIB name. Fun and thrills throughout.....I was thoroughly entertained.  Good Job!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This story isn't about the monster it's about the perseverence  of an amazing child/woman And her will to survive  dispite the odds!!! This is a MUST read!!! God Bless you Jaycee and your two precious children!!!!
B002OPZ37E|5.0|Love this band and this album was a great price so i went ahead and purchased it. my bf stole it from me.... so yea... its a good album.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I loved this book.  Another book I couldn't put down.  This man gives you great pointers and tools you can use and work with.  Austin is very encourageing and makes you fell that you can create whatever you want.  I dabble in art and loved all the apsects he gave on being creative.and the how to's.  I was so encouraged by his writing I starting practicing some of the tips he had in the book.  This is book I will read again and again.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love love love The Piano Guys. Their music is so beautiful. I can't get enough of it. Five stars!!!!!!!!
030758836X|1.0|I found this book in the recycling bin at work. At first I was really impressed by the wit and flow of the book. I was ready to give it five stars! I wondered why someone would toss this book. Soon it became clear to me why it was put in the bin! Total rubbish! It stopped making sense after the first section. I could not dispend my level of disbelief after that. I find it REALLY strange that it could be going so well and then turn and go so bad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first, which was actually pretty decent as far as movies go, but it made me wonder what they left out, so I decided to read the book. I took advantage of the Kindle lending library and was immediately hooked. I finished this book in less than a day. I wasn't even half through when I realized I was going to end up needing to buy the whole series. I know the language and writing style is more geared towards teens, but even adults can get into this story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a a a a a a a a a a awesome game thou should toatallly get it it mere me lollipop
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|The acting is great and the story line well done.  I'm a little squimish with violence and this movie had that, but not overwhelmingingly.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Great introduction of the first avenger to the movies. Action pack and it is kind of realistic. I just can't wait for the sequel of this movie.
B000JIHP88|4.0|We have the rainforest activity mat and decided to get the mobile after seeing how fascinated our baby is with the 'mobile' on the mat - I'm so glad we did!  It's been amazing because now we can turn it on when we put her to bed sleepy and she will quietly watch the mobile and usually she will fall asleep rather than just cry like she used to.  Bedtime is much easier than it used to be!  My two complaints are that the remote doesn't seem to work, and the product description says that there are three different lengths of time but there aren't, unless I am really missing something.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I don't care how old is this movie, I love every single detail about this movie and I can watch it over and over again.
B007XHWROK|5.0|I bought this CD for my daughter. I should have bought earplugs for myself but she loves it! Lord help me
B001GCUO16|3.0|For fans of the wolverine, I think that this is a good entry point for the franchise and that's about it. No deep plot, no great acting and a lot of things don't make sense. If you can put all that aside and just enjoy mindless action and nostalgic characters from the comics, you will be ok.
B004TN7QPG|1.0|This product claimed to be compatible with the kindle fire, but was not.. at least it would not load properly for me. So, basically I couldn't use it. Went with another product that would.
B004EPYZXU|2.0|This movie could be really interesting but it just takes too long for the plot to develop. The extras don't give you a whole lot more about the movie. They recover the tapes but I don't know how if we haven't send any more missions to the moon.
B009POHHRG|5.0|Ever read a review and say the best, yeah, sure. This isn't that review, simply because it's the truth. Batman: the Killing Joke, is the best Barman story ever. Don't believe it? Read it for yourself.
B0017HEX76|1.0|The description on Amazon's website stated that this DVD was in both English and Korean. When I put it in the DVD player, the menu was in Korean. I clicked on each of the three icons to see if I could find one that would change the language. The first one started the movie in Korean, the second one selected the scenes to view and the third one was for bonus tracks. These were the only choices.. There were no other screens to go to.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I read this book by paper last year.<br />It lead me to look around myself last years and throws me another vision of my life.<br />Thanks Elizabeth.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son loves legos and minecraft!  He wishes there were more sets.  The pieces are really tiny.  Good for a kid with lego experience.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Works great- fits my iPhone 5 perfectly, and let's me enjoy the phone without having a bulky shell around it. Fits easily in my front pocket. Nicer than average material, nice construction, worth the extra dough, in my opinion. Recommended!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|The story to this movie was silly, the actress playing the love interest of Channing Tatum was lacking. But, I did enjoy seeing Channing Tatum in almost every scene and of course his dance scenes were great, and Matthew McConaghey was pretty sexy too! So, I would say if you just want to see some hot guys and truly don't care about the story, then watch this movie! ;)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I fell in love with this series after 2 episodes, and I am not a TV person. The acting is amazing, the characters are definitely not forgettable, and each episode leaves you wanting more. Very highly recommended!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I went through this game a few times. The game has a really nice storyline. And the graphics for the game are wonderful with the storyline. This game is like other jewel matching games in a way, but this game has it's barriers to keep you from getting your pieces you need to get so it takes some strategy on how to move your pieces.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I'm a John Cusak fan and I like to watch his movies.  I can watch this movie over and over and it doesn't get old.  Love the Russian's in this movie.  The big guy is so hilarious.  Love it when he says, &#34;Its Russian.&#34;  If you are just into a rainy day movie choose this one.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|It is nice you have unlimited pages and can customize covers for your notebooks. I really love the leopard print cover and would love to see more animal print cover choices.
B00337KM2S|3.0|Not a George Clooney fan.  I bought it for my husband.  I made it through 2/3 of the movie and just quit watching it.  There is nothing good or funny about people all over the world losing their jobs.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|Excellent so far! The boys are working together to kill evil. Lol! The other seasons were sometimes too dark with their battles with their own dems was sometimes depressing. I haven't gotten to the episode when castile returns so looking forward to finishing all episodes.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|As you can tell with my movie selection, I choose  movies that have no substance or literary importance.  I love movies I can watch or listen to without having to think about all the troubles in the world.  I will leave that to other people.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is one of my most favorite albums. It energizes me and I love the way the Piano Guys make it their own.  Very clever and tastefully done and entertaining all at the same time. Love the song choices too.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Bounces from one Scene  to the next way too fast, makes it hard to follow what is really going on<br /><br />Batmans voice sounds retarded
B0000E1WKE|3.0|Alas, dear Ms. Houston left us during this past year. Certainly one of the strongest vocalists ever, I'm glad she left us a Christmas Album. Unfortunately, her desire to extend every other note (whether it needs it or not) works well for some songs such as 'Oh Holy Night', but ruins others like 'I'll be Home for Christmas' and  'O Come O come Emmanuel' . If you are a Whitney fan, you already know that and probably like it. If not, it gets annoying rather quick.
B004UOE7VA|3.0|So it has some creative music, however I think I like the original better! The beats in this are great, but...nah. Just pass.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|I have to be completely honest. I had never heard She & Him before getting this Christmas MP3 album through an Amazon Local deal, but I am certainly glad to have stumbled across this duo. I have really enjoyed their takes on these Christmas classics and will definitely be checking into some of their other work.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I love this movie for the holiday season, but I get so much static from people who feel the movie looks terrible. I'm confused when people say that, do you remember that Rudolph the Red-nosed reindeer stick-animation movie we used to wait for every year? Those shows looked terrible, but we still loved them. This movie looks 1,000x better than those movies, and still captures the same kind of feeling. i say give it a chance - memorable, and the hot chocolate songs kicks butt, pick it up!
1452110581|5.0|Out of stock every other day?  Yes, it is a testament to how much people want this book.  You almost don't have to be a cat person to love it.  Hilarious and poignant at the same time.  A must-have stocking stuffer for all the cat people on your list.  BTW, my order came back in stock within 24 hours.  I think this book is proving such a hit, the presses are running 24/7.  So order it -- order a dozen -- it will be money well spent.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Would recommend this book to anyone who is seriously trying to improve their love life. Sorry the series is over.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|We enjoyed the movie.  It was entertaining!  Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep are so great in this movie. Rent it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Took a little time to figure out how to find the instruction.  Other then that; they are fun games to pass the time waiting or just waste time.
B008N1V11U|1.0|Bought a week ago and it won't download, tried rebooting several times. Can't seem to troubleshoot the issue and looks like I just threw my money away. Very disappointing.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Definitely my favorite super hero movie of 2012, continuing with the quality that the first Iron Man movie started off with (we are not counting the Hulk as starting this series; either one).  Hopefully the individual Avenger story lines that come after this keep up with where this left off.  And can only hope the sequal is as good!  Totally worth a watch if you're into super hero or sci-fi type action movies!
B007SSEBCU|3.0|Love the content and of course, Meryl Streep knocks the role out of the park, but the content is pale.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Its a great movie.  Who doesn't love Forrest Gump? The blu-ray high def has definitely enhanced the movie watching experience.
B000NY12LO|4.0|Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors.  In this book you will find your self sympathizing with all of the main characters in the story, even the villain.  This is not a book for the faint of heart, you must be open minded to read this book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love that you can see the exact percentage of batterly life left on the upper left hand of my phone at any time. Seeing exactly what is taking up power is a super plus and helps me when monitor usage better.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This book is great!  My only dislike is that I am not getting anything done around the house!  My husband and I are reading the series and having a great time
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My nephew and sister love playing it. When my nephew is over he asked to play it on my Kindle Fire. The Fire is so awesome ... easy to take anywhere.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Even though I had already watched the HBO series I loved this book.  I was able to follow the story line.
B002KYXO7A|5.0|My 11 year old daughter, who is a musical theater lover, and I watched this musical together and just adored it.  While I had watched it years ago, to see an old, classic show through the eyes of someone who is discovering theater classics, was phenomenal.  It's amazing to see how well this help up over time and Gene Kelly, Donald O'Conner, etc. show the same enviable performances that viewers of all ages can truly appreciate!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this application daily!  I like that it is easy to navigate on the Kindle.  Even my husband uses this application
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome book<br />Best book I have read in my life<br />And my opinion is the best diary of a wimpy kid book ever
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I didn't think that the first book in the trilogy was good, but I coulnd't even finish this book.  This is very poorly written and frustrating to follow.  The author needed to have a better book editor
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Such a great book! Loved everything about it - it had me not wanting to put it down after one page. Loved the characters, loved the relationship - highly recommend
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I purchased this book because of all the hype that surrounded it.  I thought it was slow to start and it promoted an abusive relationship.  The editing was not done very well and I found it hard to follow because of it.  The author often times used words incorrectly.  I would much rather read an Ann Rice novel any day
527139378X|5.0|the translation is amazing! very current and accurate so far. Also, you could hardly tell this book was used, it looks brand new! thanks a lot!
0061537969|4.0|A not-very-successful racing-driver marries a nice girl, has a daughter, loses his young wife to cancer and then has to fight a lengthy legal battle against his parents-in-law for custody of his daughter.<br /><br />This is a story of Ordinary People. What makes it extraordinary is that it is narrated by Enzo, the family's loyal and loving pet labrador. A bit jealous when Denny marries Eve, Enzo comes to dote on her and, of course, on baby Zoe. But the great love of his life is his master Denny whom he supports and idolizes through good times and bad times.<br /><br />The novel is written with hindsight, so you know from the first chapter that Enzo's hips have failed and is he waiting - yearning even - for the release of that last (one-way) visit to the vet. You will need a whole box of tissues when the story comes full circle.<br /><br />Enzo doesn't write - or think - in doggy-talk. He writes beautifully. Beyond mere intelligence he is blessed with intellect and immense sensitivity. \\"How difficult it must be to be a person,\\" he observes. You will believe - you will want to believe - that every dog - that your dog - is thinking thoughts like these.<br /><br />MARLEY AND ME was a slight and pleasing novel that became a soupy, soapy movie. THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN is vastly superior, a book that touches your heart - and touches your soul.<br /><br />[Reviewer is the author of THE DROPOUT]
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Great for the price, but only the blu ray has the complete stuff. the DVD only has the movie, gave it 5 specially for the price !
B0019IB0II|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, but I just found it plodding and slow and I could not get into it, even though in theory a first-hand account of what a brain injury feels like should be fascinating.
B00975L81Y|5.0|It's a very good album, more appealing than the last one. Reminds me of the older albums like midian and chaos a. d.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love it<br />Chuck full blimp hull full full top p shop shop Dahl shop all think full full full scull
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is the cutest game. I got it for my kids but I play itjust as much as they do! I love it. It is soadorable.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is the best notes program i ever used. i started using this after i read an article as being one of the 7 best android apps to download. i use it everyday at work and on all my personal devices (android cells, android tablet, ipad, and windows desktop and  laptop).
B00479SVBU|5.0|This item was received well within the projected delivery tune - no complaint there!  this is a christmas gift for my son - so we we will see how it works in his vehicles after Christmas day - we have only heard good feedback from others who are using the product - we will keep you posted with our exprience !  Thanks for the prompt and courteous service!<br />Mary Kuschatka
0393327345|5.0|Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to talk about it much other than to say; If you're familiar with the film, you should give this a read. Check it out for yourself.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|The kids liked the movie, and we thought it was okay. I could only give 3 stars cuz the Christmas movie competition is steep.  It's worth watching if you have some time to kill around the holiday.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Rihanna outdid herself with this one! Cant wait for the Diamonds tour! My faves are Diamonds, Love Song, ,What Now, Numb
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great series keeps getting better! Cant stop watching it,keep coming back for more. Cannot get enough. Waiting to see next episode.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Just recently came across The Piano Guys & I was immediately enthralled by their amazing talent & beautiful music. They put such feeling into each song! I downloaded their album & play it each day in my library as background music. The kids love it! I'm a librarian at an elementary school. Love The Piano Guys!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Game is fun. But it can get too addictive if you are not careful. Play with caution. Allocate your time for it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I have been looking at these since they came out.  Reading reviews and wishing I had the money to do a build with it.  I finally did .  Paired with an SSD and a MB with the Z77 chipset this setup flies.  I used to have time to grab a coffee and make toast in the time my old setup took to start up.  Now, I turn in my chair to get up and its already loaded.  I am just starting to put it through the paces with 3DS Max.  I will add to my review later.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|my grandadaughter told me about this game.  it is addictive.  it is difficult to stop playing and the time goes by quickly while playing.
B009O07NDY|5.0|By all accounts, this movie and soundtrack should not exist.  10 days before the \\"end of the world\\" on December 21, 2012, humanity has been treated to one of the most anticipated soundtracks of this century.  Shore's Lord of the Rings music brings back fond memories of Middle Earth bringing to live the fictional world and all of its wonder.  After three masterpieces composed to accompany the original trilogy, the announcement that not only would the Hobbit be made, directed by Peter Jackson, and extend across three feature films, but it would also feature three new scores by Howard Shore, I knew this would be an opportunity that could not be wasted.<br /><br />Howard Shore accomplishes the near impossible and delivers that perfect score that was both required and expected by audiences across the world.  After one playthrough, I have only just begun to delve into this complicated and dense work filled with familar themes and fresh motifs.  The brilliance of the work lies in its \\"replayability\\" in that multiple playthroughs are a requirement to fully appriciate the score.  This ultimately leads to an enhanced experience as you gradually become fimilar with the nuances of the work, discovering new features of the score every time through.<br /><br />As far as the soundtrack is concerned, Shore pulled no tricks and stuck with everything that made his original work so successful.  The score is entirely instrumental and maintains that distinct Lord of the Rings feel.  As the listener moves from track to track, you recognize many old themes ranging from the Shire, to Rivendell, and the Dwarves.  Shore expands upon these familar cues by balancing old sounds and new to create a rich expansion of his original score.  In addition, to the familar themes for each character and geographical regions in Middle Earth, Shore also mixes in some of the best \\"filler\\" music of any composer.  The transitions from one cue to the next is what makes this work so memorable.  Additionally, Shore's use of the orchaestra is what makes this soundtrack so complete.  Cues range from dramatic, epic, mysterious, sad, and triumphant, while illiciting a comprehensive set of emotions that few composers can match.  As you listen, you will be reminded of events, people, and places that you experienced throuhout the original trilogy as it draws the viewer further into the movie.<br /><br />At this point, I can only superficially recognize the brilliance of the work, yet I cannot delve into the specificity required to analyze the nuances of this score.  Accordingly, this score is far more complex than the movie could possibly be.  While movie critics will draw potent analysis from one viewing of the film, it will take years of parcing through this dense work to explore all of its mysteries.  That is what makes this such an amazing accomplishment for Shore.<br /><br />Overall, I highly reccomend this score to any classical, LOTR, or movie score fan.  I also don't consider it a compliation of tracks but rather an aggregate symphonic story that guides the listeners through the movie.  Without having seen the movie, I can feel the character arcs, the locations, and the action unfolding without the visial aid.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This music is appealing to a large range of listeners. No matter what your taste....you'll love their stuff! I believe these guys will be on top for a very long time! Love this music!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Only read this one to find out why he was the was he was. A high school student could've done this work.will not be reading #3.
B00114RKT8|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've watched in some time.  Very wholsome, while not being boring.<br />Story of a man who faught to end practice of slavery in the U.K.<br />The only thing that would have been better is to have it included in the Amazon Prime collection.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This author stole so much stuff from other places. At least three scenes from pretty woman and the glider scene from the Thomas crowned affair. In fact the whole thing just reminded me of a naughty pretty woman. Her writing does not impress me at all.
B00005ND42|5.0|There are many good recordings of Beethoven's violin sonatas, particularly of Kreutzer. But this is a duo that has no equals. Even the original recording is so spruced up that you can hear them live. I highly recommend that you consider it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I read Gillian Flynn's second novel, Dark Places, after I read her intense thriller Gone Girl. Once again, the author held my interest thoughout the entire story. Not once did I figure out the jaw dropping ending. Not once. I could not put this book down. Much like Gone Girl, Flynn has dynamic character interpretation. It is dark, scary, haunting, heart-breaking and shocking and at the end, you just want more. It hit my emotions right in the gut. Flynn's first novel is next for me to read and I hope she gives us more.
B003YL4KS0|2.0|I have curly hair, and like most curlies have had it all my life and for the past year and a half I've really put a lot of effort into learning about taking proper care of my hair since I decided to stop straightening it.  I expected to learn more from this book since I had heard great reviews however I didn't learn any more than I had already learned for free online.  Additionally, the video component of the e-version did not work because I own a kindle and it only works for iPads.  I think there should have been a reduced price for kindle users or it should have been made much clearer that the video would not work on a kindle.  (If it weren't for that issue I would give it 3 stars)
B0076DEJMO|5.0|What a great book.  You need to read all the others but not required.  I'd be glad to see more books in this area of his world.

B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My 3.5 year old is terrified of most movies, which is why we didn't see this in theaters. There were definitely some scary parts for her, but cuddling up against her dad got her through them and she was really proud of herself for being &#34;brave&#34; after. My husband and I really enjoyed it too, so she's getting a copy for Christmas!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Such a pleasure to listen to this album.  During the past month my children have listened to it every night as they fall asleep and yes, I think the dreams have been sweeter:)!
B000002GB2|5.0|I grew up on this band's music and a lot of my fondest memories are attached to their songs. Is it any wonder why I had to purchase this album. Glad I did!!!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I downloaded this game last year &amp; played it many times with no problems, it was actually very fun &amp; challenging.  today was the first time I tried to play since the update last month &amp; I cant open the game AT ALL anymore.  I am very unhappy with this.  PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE ASAP!!!!
B007GE2H3G|2.0|The movie was great but was very disappointed in the video quality.  The picture was not clear and had several blippy interruptions.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Listening to them is like a happy drug to my entire being.  And I put this CD in over Thanksgiving in a CRAZY house.  CRAZY.  Like 8 kids under 12 years old crazy.  And all the madness stopped, and all the little ears became entranced by the sound coming out of the stereo.  See what I mean?  A happy drug.  Why is it a happy drug?  Because the music is GOOD.  Its good for your soul.  It makes you happy.  God's love for you comes through that cello.  Geniuses!!!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|What a great movie. Johnny Depp does it again. Showing how much of a versatile actor he is. Very different from the tv series, but great on it own.
B00973DDN2|3.0|I give this album a 3/5, but compared to Day & Age it would be a 5. The first few songs (and the last) on this album are enjoyable and Sam's Town-y, but the rest feel as if they're obvious filler. For all of you looking for Hot Fuss 2, you'll be disappointed, but that's to be expected. This album may not be able to light a fire in you, but it could probably warm your hands. Whatever the hell that means.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have always loved The Piano Guys.  My whole family loves it, and it is always uplifting and inspiring.  I like the way they arrange their songs, and it's fun to download the sheet music to play myself.  I could listen to them for hours.  Great album; always great music.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Really addictive and highly fun  adventurous cool as well as to play it like life  and you get to own your own town
141659521X|5.0|Constant action, well developed characters, current subject, Vince Flynn is the best in my opinion.<br /><br />The only problem I have with him is that when I get his latest book I can't wait to read it and then have to wait for a whole year for his next!
0345803485|5.0|I liked it and it has become one of my favorite books. I would recommend this book to everyone not just women.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What an ending...could this happen to us?  Real or not real, I hope not, but you never know. Loved these books!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|brand new like i got it from walmart!!! Play great and great quality<br />If your a bat man fan i recommend it
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I bought the blu-ray, director's cut of this film because I just love it. If the over 3 hour, director's cut edition had been released, this film would have gotten the Best Picture nomination AT LEAST. The blu-ray looks great and I just can't say enough about this film, it's one of the best. Makes you question your religion's teachings. I am an atheist and would recommend every person to watch this film at least once in their lifetimes.
0446580848|5.0|Fast captivating reading.  Combination of 'reading today's newspaper' as to it authenticity and 'side comments' from the author that make this the first book of this sort that I have ever read.  Fast moving and hard to put down.  I felt as if I was included standing there with him as he lived through this part of his life.  The asides and comments he made under his breath catch you by surprise and suddenly there's realistic humor in a serious mission.<br />I read Special Ops books.This book is a WINNER!  People who see me reading 'The Panther' are drawn to ask me why I was smiling or turning the pages with such interest. Every one of them is going to order this book one even 'bought it' on her Nook while I was enjoying the book waiting for the Physical Therapist.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|I have enjoyed DiCaprio's evolution and this movie is one of his best. All characters were done well and lent to the credibility of the story. I read that it was a thin plot, easy to figure out and so on, well too bad for those because I sit back and watch the story unfold without trying to play &#34;whodunit&#34;. If you can do the same you will enjoy this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|No cable & no satellite means I can't watch this show when it airs.<br />Thank goodness for Amazon on demand that I don't have to wait until next season to see it on Netflix.<br />The video quality was sightly jumpy at times but the ability to watch the very next day legally without a contract to a digital television serivce of some sort makes up for that very slightly lower video quality.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I think it is time for Harry to retire.  One of the draws for me has been the reality of the Bosch series.  Beiing a retired officer these are generally well researched books throughout the series as to police procedure and the dynamics in a law enforcement agency.  However, I calculated, being a Viet Nam era veteran, Harry is in his sixites.  Time to retire him and cocentrate on the Lincoln  lawyer series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like book two because it has a bit of mystery to it.  I can't wait to read book three.
B000002L99|1.0|The record quality is poor. Can barely hear it.<br />My guess is that the item was a cheap copy of the real thing.<br />Go for the more expensive item as this was the cheapest.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box Keeps you reading to find out how it ends. It is long but enjoyed the way it goes back in time to bring you back to today.
0670023329|5.0|What an amazing book.  All this hell has been going on for years and we never knew about it.  How do you teach someone to love who has no idea what it is and could even watch their mothr gt killed and brother and have no sad feelings.  It's incredible
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Was a little skeptical at first, but APU (combination of graphic processor and CPU on one chip) is the way to go.  Very good graphics and great processor for a great price.  I expected a cost savings, but was amazed at how well this system works.  Graphics plays games well, and browsing the web is super fast (better than my old 3ghz phenom + 5750 graphics card).<br /><br />Also like the lighting fast boot I get with SSD drive (10 seconds or less - again way faster that separate video card).  This processor is not only very cost effective, but is a better solution for most users ( every thing except high end graphics users expecting to spend more than the cost of this processor on graphics alone ).  Build a system around this, and I think you will be very happy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Excellent read - kept me on the edge all the way through!!  Highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys excitement.
B003DO13O2|5.0|Maybe it's because I've only had a mediocre taped copy of an old cut-out pressing of the original Lp to listen to for all these years, but this new edition is amazing, breath taking, even stunning. It almost makes me think I've never heard half the notes here before....<br /><br />This review is for the deluxe edition which actually includes an extra 3rd disc (DVD of a 5.1 surround of Oldfield's 2010 mix). Disc one is of his 2010 stereo mix plus some extra single tracks from that time, and disc two includes both the original 1974 stereo mix as well as a previously unreleased 1974 demo recording. So that's four different versions of Hergest Ridge! Wow.<br /><br />This has endured as my favorite Oldfield recording since I first got it in the mid 70's (because of it's unassuming and peaceful simplicity), and I'm delighted to see it reissued in such a complete way (although reportedly he wasn't much into the original writing/recording process, so he may not have the same appreciation as us fans for the original version). Coming after his phenomenal debut of Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge (pronounced \\"Harguest\\") is still clearly the work of a young artist trying to find his way (he was just 21), child-like in it's simplicity but also a bit stiff and serious. It lacks the warmth of a group of live musician playing together, but as a mostly solo studio-layered creation it has a different charm, introverted and contemplative, the work of a gifted (even if reluctant) musical recluse.<br /><br />Disc 1 - 2010 stereo mixes by MO - This is Oldfield's preferred version, as he was never very excited or satisfied by the original. To me it has a slightly different feel to it, softer and yet... slightly less human (ie sterile). What is most noticeable is the amazing clarity and separation of the various instrumental tracks. It shows the precision of Oldfield's arranging and playing, especially the classical guitar parts. The result is a mix of pastoral images - really feels like a simple melody that might pop into ones head while out hiking on a gentle ridge like Hergest, which is where he was living at the time, along the border between England and Wales, and multi-layered building blocks. It really sounds like something a young and earnest music major would compose (and it turns out to have been somewhat of an assignment from Virgin Record's owner Richard Branson). Overall this mix shows the parts extremely well, which include great layerings of horns, pipes and whistles as well as percussion, organ and guitar - his signature fuzzy electric and a hyper clear and clean classical. Part 1 - 19:21, Part 2 - 18:46. Compared to the '74 version, clearly Mike felt he needed to discard a couple of minutes from Part 1, although I don't know why.<br /><br />The single bonus tracks are nice and in keeping with the rest of the disc. \\"In Dulci Jubilo\\" is a playful, traditional, light, medieval sounding ditty, with a couple of electric guitar bits that tells us its Oldfield's. \\"Spanish Tune\\" is a promotional single from '74 giving a 3:10 minute edit from the end of HR Part 2.<br /><br />Disc 2 - original 1974 mix - This is my favorite, unadulterated version, the one I'm familiar with, and the reason I bought this in the first place. It does not disappoint. It seems warm and clear. There are still plenty of moments when the sound becomes over-saturated and muddy, and the tape splicing warbles, but that doesn't really detract as much as add contrast and authenticity (it is a multilayered analogue recording after all, with something like over 1,000 distorted guitar overdubs in some places on Pt 2!); absolutely lovely. Part 1 - 21:32 minutes, Part 2 18:30.<br /><br />The 4 track demo version is really interesting in that it has even more dramatic tape warble with a harsher, less married sound, sounding not as much other worldly, as under worldly. It can be hard to listen to at points, probably especially so if you've drunk too much or have vertigo... but it is sweet to hear Hergest Ridge in it's infancy. Part 1 - 21:21, Part 2 - 18:12. The similarities in length and instrumentation show just how much a written composition this was, and how close Oldfield stayed to his original when he finally entered the Virgin studio.<br /><br />Disc 3 - DVD 2010 5.1 surround mixes by MO. (Haven't checked it out yet, sooner or later I will...)<br /><br />The quality fold out case also includes a 20 page insert with an excerpt of the hiking guide to Hergest Ridge, and a detailed essay on Mike and this recording by Mark Powel, plus a nice selection of photos from that time (and the original cover).<br /><br />Any doubt about getting this? Of course not.weet to hear Hergest Ridge in it's infancy. Part 1 - 21:21, Part 2 - 18:12.

0525952926|5.0|I can hardly wait for Book 3!  The whole series so far has been excellent.  I love the mixture of the different families that it follows and have learned a lot about what was happening in the different countries during this period of history.  If you like historical fiction, I think you will like this series.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I got this app for use with my kindle. It's extremely handy as the normal battery monitor does not tell you much.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Get this great app and end frustrating wait times! This game plays with no glitches and no annoying extra graphics.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Daddies who know what real manhood and fatherhood csn be like: fun & responsible in leading their family.<br />Movie is full of action combined with heart and humor!<br />Never experienced this before when watching a movie in theatre: at some point all spectators laughed out loud and had tears in their eyes... ;)
B0054YHB8Q|3.0|3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />I was disappointed in this album the first time I heard it, & didn't pick it up until several years back. It seemed like an eternity that I waited for Boston's second album, & I was mad I had to wait so long after the first, just to be let down.<br /><br />In retrospect, this is a very good album, not the masterpiece the first was, but how many albums are? Funny title though, \\"Don't Look Back,\\" for if anything this band looked back far to long at their first in making this album. What resulted was the same formula, but knocked down from 100 proof to just 75. Still, this is a good album!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following the Piano Guys forever!  I have loved them and heard all of their music.  My seven year old loves it too.  He plays the air cello when we listen to it and he wants to play the cello as well.  I just love that my young children like it so much.  Good music is hard to come by and this is definitely good music!
B0063GORYU|5.0|good way to pass the time. just like the Pc version<br />fun and challenging<br />I like that there's more than one suit you can play
B0076DELIG|5.0|In the best tradition of Harry Bosch novels, if you like past Connelly-Bosch, you will love this one.  Five stars!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Like a lot of people, I found the Piano Guys on Youtube.  I was really excited when I found their album on Amazon and immediately got a copy.  These guys take both classical pieces and contemporary songs and make them their own.  Their covers show a great degree of musicianship and when you listen to them play (or watch them) you can tell that these guys love making music.  They're having a lot of fun playing.  I highly recommend this album and can't wait for more.
1616960922|4.0|I almost decided to give this one a pass due to its price and short length, but glad that I decided to buy and give it a read.  This isn't Sanderson's best and I think I feel that way because it was just short, yet if you are looking for a short read that isn't going to take a number of books to come to a conclusion then this one might be for you.  I hope Sanderson builds off this book and `Elantris' as he continues that series.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|thanks for making the app free.  but it should automatically come . per loaded on the kindle.  The only way I found out to download the app is because I was reading reviews.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Bubble Mania is so much fun. It is a good challenge and passes the time when having to wait or when I can't fall asleep. I like the different levels and sound effects!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I sound like a real homer, but The Settlers of Catan might be the most intuitive, fun, well designed board game currently being sold.  While the mechanics of Settlers may seem familiar (collecting resources, rolling the dice, gaining points, etc.), what makes Settlers fundamentally better than other games is how well balanced it is.<br /><br />Most games of Settlers have EACH player doing well.  No matter what strategy you choose to follow, you can be successful.  It's not a zero sum game.  Everyone can be winning before one person actually wins the game.  In comparison to a game like Monopoly, where one person tends to beat everyone else into oblivion, Settlers really does allow everyone to have fun throughout the entirety of the game.  Monopoly games almost always end in someone leaving in frustration after another player luckily gains the green and blue monopolies.  Game over.  Not so in Settlers.  Everyone can really be within striking distance of winning until the very end of the game.<br /><br />Klaus Teuber did a wonderful job creating a game that is engrossing, easy to pick up, and rewarding enough to keep people playing for a long time post purchase.  So much of the game is reliant on the human element (trading, bartering, politicking with the robber) that no two games can ever be the same.  It looks formulaic, but the number of variables keep the game fresh almost indefinitely.
145162445X|5.0|A well presented book on a complicated subject, that brought  a non science person though a hugh subject. please read It.
1451650728|1.0|Well I was really excited to read this book and had seen good reviews about the writer. I'm not sure why exactly and not sure if his previous books were different.<br /><br />The good: is that the plot points are intriguing and kept me wanting to see what happened next in this new Star Trek canon.<br />The bad: is a few things. One is that the characterization is just awful. Not once did I feel like the characters' voices and personalities matched anything to the ones I grew up with. Another, and the most important to me, is that book is painful to read; every little unimportant piece of information is extrapolated into pages of exposition that contribute nothing. I found myself skipping paragraphs until I saw something actually happening that was important.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Ever since I began following the PianoGuys on YouTube about a year ago, I have been consistently amazed and awed by their musical prowess.  Their ability to blend classical and contemporary songs has wowed thousands (millions, even) around the country, and their latest album epitomizes their musical originality.  I really appreciate artists like Jon Schmidt and Steven Sharp Nelson who produce music worthy of the genre \\"classical.\\"
B00AHSINKO|4.0|I laughed while watching this film, but it is not a comedy.  It is a serious film for older adults about marriage and commitment, about being honest with one another, about giving to the other.  I am not sure that young people, even young people who are married will get this movie.  But if you have been married for awhile to the same person, and you not a kid anymore, you will get this film.  And you will like it.
044042335X|5.0|Jack Reacher is back, and sort of down on his luck, when he not only gets financial help from an old colleague, but is recruited to get to the bottom of a pressing murder mystery. With the help of what is left of their old, deadly effective covert strike team, Jack eventually uncovers an extensive political, corporate conspiracy that threatens to do no less then threaten the lives and security of thousands of people in the good old USA. In his own, inimitable way, Jack eliminates, with deadly accuracy, each of the, even highly placed corporate, and police agents involved in carrying out the greedy and reckless sale of massively destructive weapons. Of course, he also gets the girl, and ends up on top financially, big time in the end, with alot of interesting government and military operations story thrown in for good measure. All in all, this is a lengthy, but riveting read, and vintage Jack Reacher story for all fans, and newbies of the genre.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I saw \\"Inland Empire\\" in the theaters when it first came out in 2006. It was certainly one of the strangest experiences in my life. It was a frustrating, uncomfortable, and a nightmarish experience. I did not like it very much. However, something interesting happened over the next few weeks. First of all, the night after seeing the movie, I dreamed about it. The next morning I couldn't stop thinking about it. As I remembered this surreal experience, I realized that maybe this film was not as bad as I originally thought. Over the next few weeks, I kept dreaming about this movie and couldn't stop thinking about the images. This film entered my subconscious and I frequently thought about it each day and kept dreaming about it. After a few months, I realized that what I had actually experienced a few months ago was the finest film ever made. I bought the DVD and confirmed my suspicion. I have since seen this film about 3-4 more times and I still believe there is nothing better out there. David Lynch was able to create a truly unique piece of art which can only exist in one medium - cinema. This is what it's all about - pushing the boundaries of what constitutes cinema. Federico Fellini has done it in his masterpiece \\"8 1/2\\", Tarkovsky was also successful in furthering this art with his masterpiece - \\"Stalker\\". And David Lynch belongs in this company by making this magical experience of a film. Cinema doesn't get any better than this!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought this CD as a Christmas Gift for my Father-in-Law. I download all of The PianoGuys music as soon as it becomes available through iTunes. In the summer I manage a small store where I have teens working, and whenever I have any of their music playing, all of the boys come in and ask, \\"who is that, and where can I get it!?!\\" They reach across all ages and bring so much life to their music!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Its seriously hilarious from the first minute of the movie until the end. I usually dont like Wahlberg in funny roles, but he was good in this one, and Ribisi was hysterical, as was Seth MacFarlane.
B009NPA3Q4|3.0|It isnt what I thought it would be considering some of the reviews I've read in print...doesnt really grab me like my Chief CD does.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This book upset me and at times irritated me but I could not put it down.  I was completely immersed in this family's story  and where it would go.  It went where most do not.  A book for those interested in psychology, family dynamics and truth that is blinding this is a good read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm so glad I started reading the first book, because now I can't put them down. I finished the first book in just a few days and can not wait until I can pick up the second and third! I haven  even watched the movie yet.

0525478817|5.0|Hazel Lancaster is proclaimed a miracle patient, having undergone a medical procedure that shrunk her tumor and prolonged her life. Three years after the surgery, Hazel begrudgingly attends a Cancer Support Group with other teenagers who know every waking moment may be their last. It's enough to bring anybody down and Hazel despises going. One day, however, she spots a new face in the crowd. Augustus Walters. He's witty, interesting, and just plain weird. They strike a simple friendship that soon grows stronger as they bond over books, video games, and the trip of a lifetime. Despite the constant scrutiny of those around them, Hazel and Gus determine to live a life that is not defined by their illnesses.<br /><br />I was hesitant to start this book at first- not sure if I had it in me to spend a rainy day reading about terminally ill cancer kids. However, I was hooked from the first page. This was my first John Green book and I absolutely loved every word. He has a way of bringing characters to life and making their world real. That's not to say that I know any teenagers who actually talk and act like Hazel and Gus, but I don't think that's the point. While other reviewers saw this is a negative aspect of the book, I think one of the purposes of good literature is to challenge your assumptions and show you a part of humanity you might not have understood before. As a teenager, I probably wouldn't have been friends with Hazel or Gus, but I can still become emotionally tied to them as a reader looking in on their world.<br /><br />I found this book extremely moving and well-written. It's a quick read that is great for both teenagers and adults. Highly recommended!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have always loved the Piano guys. John Schmidt has impressed me from the beginning. His music is inspirational and moving. I have played the piano since I was 6 years old. I do it out of hobby and to help at church but his music motivates me to become a pianist. When I watch the music videos of the Piano Guys you can see in his face and hear in his music the love he has for what he does. It is wonderful to see that. The other members of the group add so much to it especially Steven Sharp Nelson. Their music together is inspirational and moving. And I can't begin to express how much I love their creativity. With their love of the music that they play with the creativeness of the variety of songs and renditions, their music is very easy to fall in love with. I love it.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Great quality and fast shipment - but most of all it will provide grandson with 24 daily surprises as rewards for doing  extra good deeds.
B009NTNHJU|1.0|I expected the clean version.  There is an explicit version listed.  Searched for clean version and this one came up.  Didn't see the print that said &#34;parental advisory&#34;.  This was purchased for a 12 year old.  When you search for a clean version the explicit version should not list!
B005LAII3U|2.0|I was excited to see what the remake had in store for fans of the Schwarzenegger Total Recall but unfortunately I was disappointed on several levels. First off, I own the old version on Blu-Ray and have watched it too many times to admit. You've got classic Schwarzenegger muscles and bad acting coupled with Sharon Stone as a fit and feisty femme fatale set against the backdrop of interplanetary espionage and sordid love triangles. What's not to love about that? And of course, my favorite - the essential element of a midget prostitute involved in a gun battle at a Martian t1tty bar!!<br /><br />So in the remake we've got Colin Farrell - who was poorly cast as the lead here. He doesn't exude confidence in this role and personally I think the role demands it in order to keep the viewer engaged. When Colin Farrell looks like he forgot how to spell his own name, the only thing I'm thinking about is Schwarzenegger and his commanding performance that left me no time to wonder what the heck I was doing watching such garbage. Aside from the lead, the character development is shallow as a paper plate. We don't give a damn about the lead's female counterpart since we only experience her for a few minutes on screen before she turns into an action all star and promptly kicks our lead's butt. Does that make you care for either of them more? Not in my case. And sorry to say it, but the brief fight scene between Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone was palatable whereas the scene here with Farrell and Beckinsale reeks of stunt performance. Honestly, by that point, I was already disappointed in the setup and the main characters.<br /><br />Also - did anyone get the sense that the set was more important than any aspect of the plot? The sets here were very elaborate but they seemed to be more of the focus than the actors interacting with them. The crazy housing sets or even the posh digs where our lead gets to interact with a recording of himself were all very detailed - but they didn't further the plot. They didn't move anything along. They didn't engage or compel the viewer. So they ultimately fail at achieving their goal, which is to enrich the authenticity of the experience for the viewer.<br /><br />I could go into more detail about how the director and casting director failed at making this remake strong enough to stand on its own - but I think you get my sense of disappointment here. I give this film a resounding thumbs down and refer all viewers back to the Schwarzenegger version for their entertainment needs.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|Love this movie and being able to add it to my collection at a great price..... . . . .
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the best movies for Christmas time. Always in the classic movie picks for the season.You must watch this every year!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Bought a copy for myself and one for a gift. Nice to have it around to enjoy when we want to watch a movie with good eye candy, but no plot!
B009MF56GC|4.0|Who doesn't love all the movies all these action-movie giants have starred in over the years?? Most any of these guys have carried whole movies by themselves in the past, so it's pretty cool to see them all together in one movie, wise-cracking each other with funny one-liners like bunch of brothers!<br /><br />The actual plot of the movie is just OK...not much to it. Clearly this movie is more of a vehicle to pay tribute to all the great action stars of the '80's and '90's...at least that's how I view it. There just isn't enough \\"movie to go around\\" to really make good use of all the stars...lol. Just seeing how they interact with each other is the real entertainment value, for me. Pretty good fight scenes, but again, not enough to go around. :-)<br /><br />One reviewer makes fun of the amount of total plastic surgery performed amonst all the cast, who he called \\"aging movie stars.\\" Well, I'd be fine looking like Van Damme or Stallone when I'm their age! And BTW, what young, hulking, hotshot actor these days is there for the old guard action stars to pass the action-hero torch to?? Who has the charisma and style (even if most of them aren't top-notch actors...lol) these days that these guys have? Again, I look at this movie as a tribute to all the great 80's action movies, which, thanks to technology, we're all able to still enjoy in the form of DVD and Blu Ray!<br /><br />So yeah, not a real in-depth storyline to this movie, but there's still plenty of action and mega-macho attitude to satisfy anyone! Some think this sequel is better than the first, but I think the first one is better, to be honest. It had more character development, a better storyline that wasn't so rushed, and the fight scenes were better. Still, though, the sequel is fun to watch, so I still recommend it for fans of the first movie.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Love the batman movies and this is a good triology to buy. . . . . . . . .
B00555X8OA|5.0|While this is one of the best books on its subject, you must work hard to read it.  The concepts are not easy but anyone interested in how we think should read this book.  Kahneman offers solid evidence to support his ideas and explain how he came to believe this approach of thinking fast and slow.  He does at times offer more than most readers want.  One of my colleagues who worked at the local state hospital for the mental ill attempted to read the  book but gave up due to the depth of information.  Bottom line: read it for the knowledge of how we think and how we often deceive ourselves about how we think.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Bought this for my daughter and the cover is very protective. She does have a little difficutly plugging the charger in sometimes and the touch screen requires a little more pressure than it does without the screen cover. BUT, it is very protective.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever &amp; Ice Age Village I am a freak over tthem 2 games
B005LAII94|2.0|This is one of those films you see and then promptly forget. Not only does the casting of Blake Lively ruin any hope for watchability (with a grating narration from her throughout), most if not all of the other cartoon characters in it are laughable and/or pitiful.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I wanted a collection that I could listen to as I unwind after a long day. This album is great for listening any time of day as well.
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|Bought this album 'cause I really didn't care for her last one, but heard potential. She really blossomed in this. It's very brooding and interesting, with moments of real passion and spirit. It's not all gloom in this  record, but even the less shadowy tracks have a hint of something...unrequited. The only flaw I really see in this album is that the choruses can be more than a bit one dimensional-- lyrically /and/ melodically; but it's still a pop record after all. That being said, some magical and thought provoking lyrics can be found; &#34;still not too old to die young..&#34; and the simpler (and titular) &#34;..anything could happen..&#34; both seem inspired when mused over. At any rate, I'd really give a 4.5 out of 5, but I'll go ahead and round. This is great listening music, and cool to just hear as well.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book because it has a lot of action, adventure, and shocking events. This book is good for anyone who likes Rick Riordan books.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The Fault in Our Stars was a great book. Although sad at times, it makes you grateful for the things you have in your own life. It also makes you laugh and cry. Overall, I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone... especially those who have dealt with loss in their lives.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Halloween is the greatest horror film of all time. When you factor in the moody nuances and the homage to a great film that had come before it (Psycho, 1960) there is really no denying this fact. Written, directed, and scored by John Carpenter, this film gave birth to the slasher genre.<br /><br />The idea of setting a movie on Halloween had never been done before 1978. There had been a few films where a killer had stalked a group of teenagers (one being The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, 1974) but none had really captured the imagination or delivered such a subtle yet terrifying experiment in horror before this.<br /><br />The film still stands up to any horror movie before it or sense. It of course tells the story of a deranged killer by the name of Michael Myers who in childhood murdered his sister, Judith Myers, in cold blood in 1963 on Halloween night, only to be put into an insane asylum from which he escaped 15 years later, to return to his fictional Illinois town, Haddonfield in search of his other sister, Laurie Strode.<br /><br />What makes this the greatest horror film of all time is that it set up so many rules for the slasher genre and also broke so much new ground at the time of its release. It is a terrifying film to this day and yet relies completely on suspense to scare its audience, unlike the gore-filled clones that had come after it. For it's time it was the number one profitable independent film ever made, and after almost thirty years, no film as good as this one has ever been made.<br /><br />This is a true horror classic!
B009VB97EY|5.0|This movie reminds me of how little we really may know someone.  It is a great chick-flick and it made me really grateful to watch it with a bunch of my girl friends.<br /><br />Not recommended to watch with older brothers or parents... lol
0307276902|4.0|Before reading this, I really thought that the book will be really boring and uninteresting but once I started reading it, I started really liking it. The book itself sounds like it is about the author due to being really descriptive and all but it turns out its a fictional story. Anyways I really enjoyed reading the book and I do recommend reading the book.
0375842209|5.0|This is a wonderful book that I read for one of my children's literature class, and I love how it uses Death as a character in it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Reading Follett is like taking a trip around the world while tagging your whole family along.<br /><br />You never know what's going to happen.
B000059TEQ|5.0|A movie to be watched over and over again. I'm glad to have this movie in my collection again. I am pleased to say the DVD condition was good and it worked well.
B00571F26Y|3.0|This book was a bit too medical in some parts for me. And I would have enjoyed it more, if it was more of a 'how to' guide on living a wheat free and healthy life. Rather than just having one little chapter on that at the end.
6305212112|5.0|A movie to be watched over and over again. I'm glad to have this movie in my collection again. I am pleased to say the DVD condition was good and it worked well.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|If you like the first 3.liked the flying off of rooftops and moving objects.the staight in your face attitude.It'z there.not a remake with a new looks.it's a very curious continuation of more to come.don.t look and you will find!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is perfect!  My eyes aren't what they used to be and the display is large and easy to read.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|fun for the first couple of hours and then you have to spend money for credits to buy more cards.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|This CD is another wonderful release of such amazing talent from Justin Bieber, Our entire family enjoy this CD at Christmas.
B00499K9E0|5.0|This show is the best show ever!!! That's not entirely constructive but it's what I've got, I don't see how this show could be any better. I watched both seasons faster than I wish I did because now knowing I'll have to wait at least another year to see another episode of Sherlock is driving me crazy!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I was turned on to the Piano Guys by my son who saw one of their videos/songs for orchestra class.  All I can say is, \\"wow\\".  They have taken current songs and blended them with the classics.  Their creations are brilliant, moving, funny and witty.  What I like most is that it touches all ages, young to adult.  My boys love listening to their music as much as I do.  How many times will that ever happen?  You won't be disappointed.
B0034G4OZE|4.0|Craig is a confused, depressed, and borderline \\"suicidal\\" teen who visits an ER and subsequently gets admitted to the mental health unit.  He is introduced to Bobby and Noelle, plus his roomate, Matata who spends all his time in the room.  The psychiatrist played by Viola Davis, of \\"The Help\\" helps Craig confront his problems and try to cope with his family situation. Craig becomes aware of hidden talents he has as he's forced to join in group activities, like art and music.  We are also introduced to other characters like the Hasidic Jew who tripped on too much acid and other characters, who Craig discovers have far and away worse troubles than he has.  Through this process, Craig is able to recognize his inner strengths, able to verbalize his reluctance to attend a high achieving program that his father wants, and develop some relationships with people that he otherwise wouldn't meet.  The actors all portrayed their roles very well and even brought a lot of humor to this movie that could end up being very down and dark given the theme.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This author has had a truly life-changing experience, that is clear. It is also clear that the author is a doctor and does not have a PhD in neuroscience. His interpretation of what he experienced is not correct.
B005F3XV62|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone.  It is good to know there is still some clean humor in our nation which good families can watch together and enjoy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I LOVE Downton Abbey. It is fantastic. The only disappointing thing is that I have to wait to see the next season.
B004EPZ034|5.0|This sequel is just as awesome as the first 2.  There are actually some cool life application lessons for, not just young people, but for us all.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I originally rented this movie on Netflix, and knew I had to buy it after watching it!  Excellent movie and the quality of the Blu-ray is above and beyond!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This album is so dark. I mean that in a very good way. From the beginning track to the end it is a the journey. Radiohead never ceases to amaze me with their style and the albums that I have bought so far I enjoy quite a bit.
B009DB60W4|5.0|Sure it's not the Band we would have died for in the past. I'm serious. I have told my kids: I want my three hour Best of personal CD to be my death bed music, when it's time for me to go.<br /><br />For sure, nothing from the last two albums is on there. This album has three songs that I can add. Sure it's in French and that's a little weird but the music slams along pretty damn good. There's even some growling. And sure, it's \\"a little\\" pop, for them, and that's why it isn't the best they have ever done. And Lori is no Sarah Jezebel Deva but if you just let the music flow around you, some of it is sure to get into you.<br /><br />For the record, I like Lori. She takes some getting used to but I like Aesma Daeva. The thing that decided me is that she doesnt have to strain to reach her higher notes. It all comes naturally for her. Her voices merges with the metal effortlessly, with power and energy. Makes her ok in my book.
B000002UJQ|5.0|One of the best albums put out by Radiohead. There is not much else that I can say about this album that has not already been said. I thoroughly enjoyed this album and picked it up on a recommendation from a friend.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|the first time i heard bruno mars i was getting ready for work and from the living room came this awesome funky music... it was him and his band performing on the today show my wife had on. we both stood riveted to the tv watching him. it was some of the best played music i'd heard in awhile... so i rushed out that day to buy the then-new 'doo-wops and hooligans', put it on in the car... and hated it. it was not the same experience as the band when they perform live...<br /><br /> then a few weeks ago, and a few years later he's on the tonight show, and once again he blows me away. just this morning he did the same on the today show once again... i knew he had an album coming soon, but i was not too hopeful... so i went on itunes, liked the samples and bought it. on my way into work i soaked in the funky glory of this record. it's just awesome, and sounds like a band, not an experiment in pro-tools like the first record... frankly i think the perfect way to record this particular group would be to record in one take, in a reverby big room with old equipment. but i digress... this album is absolutely killer. i especially like the motown groove of 'treasure'. i gotta see this guy live.
0553801473|4.0|I know that history is made of a lot of characters but in a Feast for Crows we saw more about some good characters, like Arya, and the rest of Stark family.<br />A Dance with Dragons lack of some characters and sometimes it's not that interesting, It's still a great book and I will keep reading the next to come, but when I heard that a the 4 and 5th book were 1, I kinda knew that would be too separate.<br />Maybe the 6th will not be so &#34;separate&#34;.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|This cd has stayed in my cd player home car since I bought it, never a dull moment. Ian challenges a few topics the election, our nations treatment of the Indians. This is on par with Dylan's Tempest, Hiatt's Magic Pinball and Robert Plants live shows of the Sensational Space Shifters. If you love good music, great lyrics pick it up. Could be the album of the year since I dont know of anyone else putting out anything new.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Loved it. Took me awhile to get into it but I'm glad I did. Good book. Want an interesting story read this trilogy.
B00123IB32|5.0|No they are not the Clash, Buzzcocks, Sex Pistols or Iggy Pop but this cd gives them merit to this exclusive club of musicians using accordians, banjos stand up bass along with traditional rock n roll instruments and they not only rock but deliver a message.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is such a great product.  The quality and sound that the Piano Guys produce is simply astounding.  They are the first album I reach for when I am studying for my finals or any other tests that I have to prepare for.  Definitely keeps you awake and awe inspired.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|This film is not a musical per se, but any music lover will most definitely dig this insightful and dramatic movie.
0783232039|5.0|Amazing Movie, I loved it (: it has an amazing soundtrack. I loved the whole movie. I love Chucky &#60;333
B0053O89KG|5.0|This was on my grandaughter's Christmas for Santa and she loves CASTLE.  Now she will have her own to watch anytime...if she loves it, I love it.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|I took this after knowing that a Yang Lee decided to make a picture based on this, so I had lots of expectations. But I just managed to finish the book without any curiosity and just because I had to !
B005CVWWJY|3.0|An easy read (perhaps a bit too easy) and moderately entertaining, I would guess the audience who will enjoy this book the most are 15-30 years of age and have a well above average interest in computer games, movies and all things related.<br />I usually read more hard core sci-fi like William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, so to me it just wasn't serious and complex enough to really interest me in a profound manner.<br />That being said, I found the book very difficult to put down and read it at a faster pace than usual, so it couldn't have been that bad.
B006ZZQH4W|5.0|Bite size Maeve. Perfect  commute fare.<br /><br />I love these short story collections, just made for Kindles & daily commutes - publishers take note!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is the best album so far in my opinion by Susan Boyle. Her voice never ceases to amaze me
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This sharpener may be alright as a back up to carry in your back pack but it certainly did not work as well as other Smith products I have used.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love the album, love all of The Piano Guys' music.  The videos are great too.  I cannot wait until the tour to my neck of the woods!  Congratulations!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|So far, it works as advertised.<br />I really like it because I like to hear my talk shows and news through my wireless bluetooth headphones rather than wake the household in the morning!<br /><br />Plus, I get really bad reception for many of my &#34;local stations. With TuneIn, I get crystal clear stereo radio, exactly as if I were listening on the regular radio (slight time lag, so don't try to win any call-in contests while listening via TuneIn!)<br /><br />Add to that, I can listen to other stations across the country... not just in my tiny closed area with little radio choices.<br /><br />I'm using it on an AT&T-branded Samsung Galaxy S3, and so far I've had no problems at all.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I started this book listening on tape as my husband and I traveled to see our daughter.  We didn't quite finish it so I just downloaded it and finished on my Kindle.  I have mixed feelings.  It bogged down in spots and became predictable (the kiss of death for me).  I enjoyed the fact that it put you in the shoes of an expat living in Europe.  How I wish I could take a day trip to such exotic places!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|This album was on repeat for me back in the early 90's. I thought this guy had killed himself and was really glad to find out he didn't.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The plot and unique way of writing this book from the perspective of both the husband and the wife was refreshingly different.  It is a real page turner and has you guessing for a long time.  The end is believable based on the character development.  A good job!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Ok, first of all, the premise is absurd to begin with - billionaire orphan becomes masked crimefighter with near superhuman abilities. But you go in knowing that, so you give it a pass. What I find hard to give a pass to are all the inconsistencies and leaps of logic and/or faith you are asked to accept or ignore. These are detailed in many other places and some are spoilers so I won't go into them. But, if you suspend disbelief and just watch it for what it is - a comic book story with pretensions - you'll enjoy it. I did. But that doesn't mean it's worth more than three stars.<br /><br />Plus, be advised - you need the flixster app to watch the ultraviolet copy. It won't download to iTunes.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one of my best read this year. I read all the other books from William Landay after this one.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Well worth watching over and over again.  A message that is much needed for our time.  You won't regret the purchase.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Gillian flynn has a very good and interesting story, but she's expediting the end, and the book is suffering from that.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|900 pages and unlike most of his books I would have only cut out about 75 pages (unlike Tommyknockers where a good 300 pages could have been lost). Great story that makes you think long after the covers are closed.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I don't generally like to buy dvds, especailly if I haven't already seen the movie, but I caught this movie on special for 3.99$, so I snatched up a copy for my daughter and one for my niece. It was a really cute movie that my 2 year old loved and the colorful animation and fun story and songs captured and held her attention (which is hard to do unless you're Mickey Mouse!) I would highly recommend this movie, even for older children and adults, as my husband and I both enjoyed this movie as well. The main lesson of the story is also a really really good one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is my second best  book this year (the fault in our stars being first). Love the characters. Love that they are real. Love that I cared for them.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|What begins as a straightforward, lightweight spy tale takes strange turns into mind-numbing bureaucracy, odd romances, and the world of literary fiction.  Through it all, the reader senses that something isn't quite right.  There's a pea somewhere under the narrative mattress and crafty Mcewan doesn't let in on the secret until the final page.  Narratively, the book is quite clever.  Unfortunately though, the plot required a few more twists and a little more character resolution.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It was love at first listen. Ever since I found their music on youtube I couldn't stop listening! The album is fantastic! Cant wait to hear what they come up with next.
B005LAII08|4.0|it's a great movie but for pixar?? i would have to give a 4 star rating on that<br />my toddler son loved it but it seems like this movie is for girl...............
B004MC8CA2|2.0|This program will periodically start itself up and run in the background. I use Tecarta's app for my Kindle Bible; I only use this one for the audio version. I&quot;m going to find an alternative for audio and remove this prgram. I don't trust programs that start themselves up on their own.
034580404X|1.0|when i read the review of the people saying &#34;this is the best book ever&#34;, i think they never read anything good in their lives.<br />i read them cuz everyone was talking about it, and i realized i should not listen to what everybody said
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the Piano Guys' work. John and Steve have so much to give! My friends and I wish that there was a DVD of their work to showcase the rest of the Piano Guys' video-making talent that helped bring so many fans on YouTube. It's so fun to watch these guys play and see their love for music!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is typical Grisham and if you like Grisham, which I do, you will like The Racketeer, which I did.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I hadn't watched this movie in years and bought it for my 6-year-old twin girls after they heard my mother and I sing &#34;Do-re-mi&#34; They loved it and were singing along and for days after! I forgot how many songs are in there that we all know and love and how much of the movie I remembered. I'm so glad I added it to our collection!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|What I love most about this CD is that these guys are masterful musicians. The songs are not originals, but its clear that you are listening to world-class musicianship. It's clear they are at the top of their craft. Look forward to every song.
B0028NSE5K|4.0|These two make a good pair. Music is really good. Some talking in there, but overall, good cd.Came new as advertised.
B004SIP98S|4.0|Helen Mirren does a wonderful job of portraying the Queen.  You see the Queen as a person not just a royal figure head.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Im a big fan of Zombie movies and usually have to wait a few years for a new one to come out.
B0045HCJRQ|4.0|I'll not give away the ending but suffice it to say that Sommersby has a very strong storyline.  And must be followed closely if you are to understand the story.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I enjoyed the best exotic marigold hotel. The pictures of India and the Indian people was so beautiful and interesting to see.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works great.  Very uick delivery of the product.  Needed it in Afghanistan and arrived in a very timely manner.  Would recommend
B003VWU2WA|3.0|I had one of these a couple years ago, but I took it back because the drivers weren't working properly on my 2006 Intel MacBook Pro. Anyway, after 6 years I decided to buy a new one for use with my 2010 Mac Pro, which runs Mountain Lion. It works well, but it seems a little limited. And it DOES NOT work if the display is asleep, so I can't control the iTunes volume without waking the display and logging in to my mac.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Not the best in the series but very good.  Vince seems to be making Mitch a little more &#34;human/normal&#34; and I don't particularly like that aspect.  Great insight on other characters & definitely a path to another few books to continue the saga.<br /><br />Heartily recommend. I read it in 2 days & my wife in a little over 2 days.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|I bought a couple of these, one for my old MacBook Pro charger that I leave at home, and one for my Cinema Display. It does the job, and I'm glad that apple decided to make them after designing a slightly slimmer version for use with the new thin rMBPs and MBAs. Though, it could have gone for $5 IMHO.
0316182060|5.0|Received really quickly in the mail in good packaging.<br />The story is really interesting and is also a book series which I just found out. Book 3 won't be out until June 2013 but you can read the book instead.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|At first I thought this was just a moderately decent erotic book.  The plot is actually fairly engaging and kept me wanting to read through all three books.
B00005NRN9|4.0|if you have the other one, forgot the name, Dralion or so, you have most already. But still it is classic.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Game frequently freezes up and will not allow movement of pieces.  Colors are beautiful though.  Fills in the time while watching tv.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great feel good movie with excellent seasoned actors. I love the interactions between the British hotel guests and the young Indian hotel manager. :)
B002M87V0A|4.0|Not much for musicals but this is a good one. Great story, and good acting.  The music is actually part of the story and not contrived like most musicals.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Hey the dancing was great, but the storyline was a lot more depressing than the trailer made it seem. I would give it 2.5 stars because I did like parts of it, but it didn't keep my attention.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Protagonist is a great original character. Plot theme about fate and freedom is a nice change from most of the movies out today, though there are some contradictions on the subject in some of the scenes. Definitely worth renting. I wish that it had been extended a bit longer, and I think the plot and the characters (all the members of the family are great!) could have easily supported it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie is great for kids and adults alike. It is inspiring, emotional, and funny. I highly recommend it, and the Pixar work is amazing!

B000VK99Z6|5.0|Funny, dry humor, interesting storyline and a little gruesome. Any guy would love it.  Simon Pegg always makes a movie a hit.
B004USRKR4|5.0|Wistful alt-rock perfectly captures the bittersweet of a boy's first love. The music was perfect in the movie but is even better on its own.
0307730697|5.0|The tale of Adam Brown is the most motivating tale of persistance and courage I've read in a long time. The undaunting courge of Adam and his team mates but of the wives and children of these extrordinary men. This book os a must read for all.
B000KBCHRS|3.0|this movie is slow and ridiculous to have to pay the regular Amazon fee for watching a movie at $1.99 for a half hour episode. very very slow
B009RI4FRU|2.0|The best part of this movie can be seen by watching the movie trailer - very disappointed in movie particlulary given the actors.
0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One is a great, quick read for nerds and former nerds who obsessed about movies, music, video and pen and paper games in the 1980s.  The characters are easily relatable for those of us who struggled to interact with others in our adolescence, and the concept of a global contest testing old nerd culture knowledge is pure awesome.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am new to the hunger games series and quite pleased with Suzanne Collins work. You feel like your right there in the arena with the details to every character well written. I'm looking forward to the movie to do this second book justice.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|A joyful, funny read. An innocent and slightly nerdy young man goes to work in Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore and discovers a network readers working on one of the greatest questions of all time. The characters are amusing and the plot is as twisty as a bed spring. Neil Gaiman fans will probably like this.

1594744769|3.0|I loved seeing all the pictures in the book, but the actually content out of the book was...weird. Didn't enjoy the actual story line. I realize that this is a fictional book but it was still pretty outlandish and hard to follow.
193609648X|4.0|The photography is beautiful and there are plenty of projects included that are worthy of my time and energy. I made the bobble mitts and they are beautiful-- many compliments! All my friends want me to make them a pair. The directions are pretty good-- although, I'd rather the author didn't assume I know anything about crochet. I like every step written out clearly.

0439023513|2.0|Some spoilers below.<br /><br />I was so excited to read this book after Catching Fire, which I devoured in one day. That one left me eagerly anticipating this final book and wondering how all the different plots and subplots were going to be wrapped up. After reading it in one sitting last night, I have to say I feel fairly empty and somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />I understand it's a novel about war, war is hard, war changes people, and I appreciate that the author didn't shy away from some truly horrible events and the hopelessness that accompanies them (though killing Prim - the ENTIRE reason Katniss got herself into the situation in the first place - made it all almost seem worthless; the one thing she wanted to do was save her sister, and it made it seem like all her efforts and self-sacrifice were for naught..), but a lot of the soul seemed to be sucked out of this book. The final bit in particular felt so rushed and incomplete that it was almost like reading someone's quick notes on something they intended to flesh out further later on. Collins spent the first two books painstakingly, carefully, gently cultivating and growing this complicated relationship between Katniss and Peeta, only to throw it on its head and then sum it up in basically a summary paragraph at the end. It felt very unfulfilling as the \\"closure\\" on something she was so careful to develop in the past books. The whole last part of the book after Katniss returns to District 12 could have been a few extra chapters on its own and I'm not sure why the novel just picks up speed at that point and becomes more and more summary-like, almost like you were already reading the epliogue.<br /><br />There were some bright lights scattered in the book - Katniss' initial heartfelt speech as the Mockingjay, Finnick spilling his \\"secrets,\\" the brief moments when Peeta's old personality breaks through his confusion, Johanna fleshing out as a character, Finnick and Annie's relationship and wedding, etc. Katniss, however, seems to become a shell of her old self, and even in the end you get the feeling she's just as depressed as ever.<br /><br />In all I was somewhat let down by the end to this series. The first two books were fantastic and I just felt like the conclusion could have been so much more epic and wrapped up the loose ends so much better. Instead we get a bleak, hopeless war where no one is trustworthy and characters you've come to love are so damaged and changed (or vengeful, or depressed) that you don't really know who to root for, or if there's anything left rooting for. Again, I do understand the message that war sucks, and there are no real winners, but I feel like there should have been something left to hope for by the end, and maybe just a few more glimpses of the heroine from the first two novels... I wouldn't have minded seeing more of the old brilliant, well-spoken Peeta as well; he was the character I probably admired most.<br /><br />Anyway, it's probably still worth the read (especially if you're dying to find out how the story ends like I was) but don't expect to be completely fulfilled by it.niss, however, seems to become a shell of her old self, and even in the end you get the feeling she's just as depressed as ever.<br /><br />In all I was somewhat let down by the end to this series.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|The best book yet written by Tim Ferriss. I had never envisaged cooking not to be about food, but about life. He has also become a master in marketing, pure genius to sell this book for $4.99 it one of the few books I would have paid $14.99 for with Kindle. Besides Free, $4.99 and between free is the perfect price point. BTW I purchased this book because I enjoy Tim's work net because of the price. However, I do like it when there is a bonus like this, quality writing, pin point subject and a price that is on point. KUDOS Tim Ferriss.
0385535147|5.0|This book I could not put down.  This book like his last one(The Litigators) profiles the &#34;underdog&#34; in the law business.  Both were real &#34;page turners&#34;.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|I watched this movie just because Tom Cruise was appearing in it.  My wife and I wanted to turn it off after the first 5 mins.  We were thinking that this was going to be a movie similiar to Grease.  But it seemed like this movie was just a long music video. So we ended up finishing the movie by fast forwarding it to the parts with Cruise.  If this was the last movie on earth I would burn it just to entertain my self with the flames.

This album is so beautiful and enjoyable that we find ourselves listening to it in the car, at the computer, on the stereo, and never grow tired of it.  Their music is fun, classical, inspiring and beautiful.  You have to buy one for yourself and family friends too.  What else can you spend $9.99 on that will give the recipient so much joy?  You will love it. [[ASIN:B008XX6J4C The Piano Guys]]  Check out their Youtube site also.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|The new version is in Blue Ray format had enhance this movie's panoramic beauty . This 1995 version  had great cast with Jennifer Ehle and Collin Firth as Mr Darcy. Very dashing and handsome and a great actor. The movie overall  is a great movie fun and full of romantic comedy and i can watch the movie over and over again. The acting quality of Jennifer Ehle and Collin Firth had set the bar for future adaptation of Jane Austin novel.

1439148813|5.0|Okay, I think we can all agree that Gene Kranz isn't the most polished writer in the world, but he was a first class flight director. He doesn't dive much into personal details except for the occasional note about his growing family and the fact that the white vests were his wife's idea but he does a job of describing the culture of Mission Control in NASA's early days. From his first encounter with the Mercury astronauts (\\"Yeeee-haw!\\") to Apollo 13 and beyond, he takes us behind the scenes to show us what it was really like.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Regardless of your opinions of the film series, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy is legendary in every sense of the word. Howard Shores' scores for the three films have won industry awards, portrayed him in a new celestial light among film score composers, and won him the infinite adoration of countless fans both consumer and professional alike. With his score for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, what's presented is both an improvement upon legacy themes as well as introduction of new ones, making The Hobbit's score yet another rooted and timeless classic in its own right.<br /><br />Opening track \\"My Dear Frodo\\" encapsulates and epitomizes so much of what we've come to expect from Shore's work on the original LOTR trilogy's scores, incorporating majestic horns and strings and both female and male choral vocals, portraying hope, optimism, trepidation, and reluctance all rolled into one. \\"Old Friends\\" outlines a comfortable and fun vibe, furthering to feelings of relaxation and content, yet displaying a barely noticeable surrounding of cascading apprehension. And thus the first of two discs continues, building upon a foundation of Shore's legacy material with development into new and extrapolated themes: \\"Axe or Sword\\" alternates between striking confluences of string-construed hills and horn-excavated valleys; \\"The Adventure Begins\\" rouses the soul into a quick pace following its introduction, and \\"The World Is Ahead\\" carries upon the strength of Shore's original trilogy inasmuch as its blood-stirring, triumphant, and inspirational construction. \\"An Ancient Enemy,\\" one of the first disc's highlights, reintroduces male choral vocals shown at a prior point in the score, yet layers them over scathing string and horn work, thrusting forth a grandiose and impressive statuesque scope, reminiscent of the Balrog scene from The Fellowship of the Ring but brandishing a more gentle beauty and tumultuous evolution. \\"Radagast the Brown\\" begins with yearning female vocals and soon incorporates spiraling strings and quick-paced yet low-key percussion thrown into a cavity of scant LOTR thematic material which ends on a hair-raising escalation of horns. Tracks on the first disc continue to follow a similarly treacherous yet whimsical pattern, beginning with \\"The Trollshaws,\\" continued by the existential flair of \\"Roast Mutton,\\" and seemingly culminated in \\"The Hill of Sorcery,\\" introducing the pending and rousing tracks of the second disc with a quickened theme, intermittently slowed by cautious horns and strings that quickly break into a cavernous and intimidating volley reminiscent of The Fellowship of the Ring's music surrounding the Moria scenes. \\"Warg-Scouts\\" ends the first disc's collection of music by displaying an involved yet troublesome and somehow amiable web of orchestral provenance.<br /><br />\\"The Hidden Valley\\" begins the second disc with recurrent themes with an undertow reminding of Inon Zur's score to the wonderfully exalting The Lord of the Rings: The War In the North video game. It's an excellent leadoff track, going from serene and heartfelt strings to a rousing march leading to \\"Moon Runes,\\" which yields female vocals that evoke majesty, egregious beauty, and utter timelessness early on. Soon later, \\"The White Council,\\" a personal highlight, floats onwards through volition through hapless, boundless acquisition to storied and fanatical gravitas, an ultimately influential and consequently important piece on the album. \\"Over Hill\\" carefully incorporates traits of the triumphant Bag-End theme from LOTR as it's poisoned with suspense, while \\"A Thunder Battle\\" will move the listener to the musical accompaniment to LOTR's Moria scenes yet again. \\"Brass Buttons\\" boldly defines the destiny of the score, injecting an exciting and imploding track of commanding authority and casual musical competence, all the while cementing the listener's desire to retain synergy with the remainder of the score and its merits, after which it transforms into a haunting track of illustrational heritage as well as efficacious and developmental beauty. \\"Out of the Frying Pan\\" shows an insurmountable effectivity in suspense and nonchalant aplomb and compositional countenance, leading into \\"A Good Omen\\"'s singular string/horn lead being pummeled by juxtaposed string/synth and orchestral, serene conglomeration. \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain,\\" an acoustic yet pronounced piece, illustrates Neil Finn of Crowded House playing a monumental and summarily beautiful song, that strikes as slightly ineffectual relating to the film's score itself, into which \\"Dreaming of Bag End\\" soars, soon and lovingly collapsing into tranquility rather than peaceful finality, alternately ending the original score on somewhat of a curious prelude (but perhaps intentionally). Additional tracks \\"A Very Respectable Hobbit,\\" \\"Erebor\\" (the first to incorporate bagpipes), \\"The Dwarf Lords,\\" and \\"The Edge of the Wild\\" simply encourage further involvement in the score, the last of which contains striking, distinct, and reckless awe via bass and horn branches reminiscent of Cliff Eidelman's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.<br /><br />With the score drawing to a close, I sensed an incalculable gap between it and any future scores in the series, which is much how I felt following The Fellowship of the Ring. I sincerely love Howard Shore and his music, and love it or not, The Hobbit will undoubtedly shape your opinion going forward. Whether you're a fan of Shore's Lord of the Rings scores, or not familiar with them at all, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey will dazzle and uncontrollably undulate your senses with effortless character throughout its massive length. Make no mistake, Howard Shore has created a masterpiece here that rivals his work for the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, that somehow seems to not only incorporate his legacy series music, but also capitalize upon it with new themes and frighteningly apathetic motivation given the music's quality. Howard Shore's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey will rouse you more than Fellowship of the Ring, inspire you more than The Two Towers, and impress you more than that of The Return of the King, because what he introduces with The Hobbit score is the beginning of a new legendary and epic journey rather than a casual lap around the tracks which made him originally famous. I implore you, do not miss this work of heart-stopping beauty!<br /><br />Note: The extended version of Shore's score (reviewed here) contains six tracks of extended material totaling almost eight minutes, within \\"Old Friends,\\" \\"Radagast the Brown,\\" \\"Moon Runes,\\" \\"The White Council,\\" and \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain.\\" Also included in the extended edition are six bonus tracks totaling over eleven minutes, including \\"Blunt the Knives\\" and \\"The Trollshaws,\\" along with the second disc's ending tracks \\"A Very Respectable Hobbit,\\" \\"Erebor,\\" \\"The Dwarf Lords,\\" and \\"The Edge of the Wild.\\"er which it transforms into a haunting track of illustrational heritage as well as efficacious and developmental beauty. \\"Out of the Frying Pan\\" shows an insurmountable effectivity in suspense and nonchalant aplomb and compositional countenance, leading into \\"A Good Omen\\"'s singular string/horn lead being pummeled by juxtaposed string/synth and orchestral, serene conglomeration. \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain,\\" an acoustic yet pronounced piece, illustrates Neil Finn of Crowded House playing a monumental and summarily beautiful song, that strikes as slightly ineffectual relating to the film's score itself, into which \\"Dreaming of Bag End\\" soars, soon and lovingly collapsing into tranquility rather than peaceful finality, alternately ending the original score on somewhat of a curious prelude (but perhaps intentionally).

Sometimes you need a sweet love story that takes you away for a while.  Sometimes you need to believe that love like that exists.<br /><br />This book does just that.
B0014GVCI8|3.0|Well it is an ok movie if you like depressing things. When I bought it it had been a long time since I had seen it and I thought that it was just ok.
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|It has really neat ideas and is visually very nice, but it is too confusing to just pick up and use.
B002PZ1H6E|5.0|This is an adorable movie, and I love it! How Peter Rabbit came to be, and many more of the wonderful children's books that Miss Potter wrote.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|The retailers now days should watch this movie about 10 times and listen to the message.<br />We really loved this movie :)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good story<br />Kind of far fetched storyline, but I enjoyed reading it. It is definitely worth your time to read it.
B003UPEH8S|4.0|The rhythm is a dazzling array of percussion, mostly African and Brazilian samba, from artists around the world. It's a soothing and ambient high that rarely lets you down. When the songs aren't great, because the melody of the lead vocals can't keep up, as on the Cool River, Paul Simon himself is to blame. But this is his best, most poetic album so far; timeless in the sense that live tribe music never dies. Even if you're not an Elvis Presley fan yet Graceland is one of your favorite places to visit, it takes some time to unravel the musical complexity and fully appreciate the beauty of The Coast, Spirit Voices and the like.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love Buddy's infectious innocence, his wide open love for all good things, is truly heart warming. I watched this movie recently with my two year old granddaughter and she really liked it. We had to fast forward through the parts about the creation of the book, Board meetings and whatnot, she wasn't interested and I suspect didn't really get it. She really liked Buddy and Santa's appearances. I just love this movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was captivating. I couldn't stop reading. I can't wait to read the next book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Gratifying ending to the journey of Bruce Wayne. I'm a Marvel guy, but this trilogy and this ending is just much better than any movie Marvel has ever produced. I equally love Avengers, but this movie hands down has a message where Avengers is mostly action.<br /><br />I will say something very controversial here: This is the MARVEL version of Batman how Stan Lee would have envisioned Bruce Wayne. A man filled with tragedy and emotions, that did his best to arise above it all.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a very good book... it was funny and for kids are age.....Jeff Kinney has just made another best seller.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'm a Marvel guy and this one is definitely their best comic book movie. Dark Knight Rises and Avengers are top of my comicbook based movies. Lots of action and it is great seeing all these heroes come to live. DKR is hands down a deeper movie with a message, Avengers is full action.
1849904251|5.0|It's everything I wanted and more. Gives information about the show in an interesting manner. I was a bit worried it wouldn't get on time, but it just arrived in mint condition. So glad I got this!
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I love this movie. It is really great. Watch it now. Will take you on an adventure. Great for everyone to watch.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever. The photography in the beginning was amazing. Really a must see movie.
1401307450|5.0|Reading this I felt like I was there.  AK is one of the greatest front mans in the world.  So sexy, so unbelievable he is now in his 50s!!!!  LOVE HIM!!!!!!  Anthony could write a book about his everyday life and I would read it!!!
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I just moved and couldn't help thinking about this movie. I enjoyed it as if I've never seen it before.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Their music is universal in its appeal.  It has something for everyone, and the songs never get old or tiring.  They are perfectly rendered, the music is both thoughtful and exciting.  The pianist and the cellist are extremely talented.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Ever since I first heard their music last summer, I've been a huge fan of the Piano Guys. I haven't bought the album but I have downloaded several of their songs and I never get sick of them. I love the way they take their pianos and cellos to exotic places to film their videos. I love the way they put a new twist on hit songs, sometimes remixing them with classical music. They are the right mix of the right kind of talent.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I loved the movie. It arrived promptly. I would recommend this movie to a friend. I would watch it again.
B00846REIS|5.0|Better then 50....more of a story line,  couldn't put it down can't wait for Entwined in you to come out!!  May can't come fast enough
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I loved the movie. It arrived promptly. I would recommend this movie to a friend. I would watch it again.
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|Too busy to have watched this copy but have seen it enough times before and it's one of my favorites. Cheesy but when you're in the mood for it, it's the best!
B004XZR63M|5.0|this is a basic s starter book a in the whole series for this, author. lots of  Stories wrapped up with lessons on how to start a solid financial life. It w was a no putdown for me. Read straight through and reading it again for the lessons. Makes a lot of sense what he is saying.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|My first venture in to e books, so I may be doing something wrong.  I'm enjoying reading my purchase on the Kindle for Android, but I enjoy reading on the FRB reader more.  Wish I could get my purchase on the FRB.  Can't get the portrait orientation to apply on Kindle on my Toshiba Aspire.  Perhaps my bad.  Good book, though.
1426308469|5.0|What a great book! The little guy is going to love it!  The pictures are fabulous!! And the facts are stated so that kids can totally relate. Great job!
B00846REIS|5.0|I started reading this book and couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the last bok to come out.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|great movie, a must see.  well written, great actors, makes you stop and think, had to by it to add to my collection
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was consumed as soon as I started this book. I read it within a day. I wish they would have come out with a 4th book.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Michael Buble offered me 20 bucks to give this thing a good review--said he's trying to drive up sales so he can buy a sweater for his dog. I would have done it for 7 dollars, that's how good this thing is. BE WARNED: he sings some of these songs in a real gravelly 'hardcore' voice.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was consumed in this book as soon as I started reading it. I loved this book and can't wait for the next book to come out.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Don't believe the bad word--this movie is a true classic, tragically (and inexplicably) fallen by the wayside. Big adventure 100%.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Truly is an amazing work, definitely worth purchasing to help support these guys. Anyone with interest in classical music should look into these guys, a friend showed me their stuff recently and I haven't been able to stop listening since.
0446547654|3.0|I have read every novel by Nicholas Sparks.  I feel like his books have become more movie scripts than books.  &#34;he Best of Me&#34; was slightly disappointing to me.  I hope he comes out with a great novel again.
B001A3GSFW|5.0|Loved the Ramones then, love them now! The price was a great deal as well. First music I've bought on line, stored in &#34;the cloud&#34;.
0061438294|3.0|My husband needed  a book to guide him with job interiviews because he tends to have poor body language.  He didn't really like this book and didn't find it very useful.  I think he scanned it and never really read it.
B000002P6R|5.0|This is a very underrated album in remixed and remastered form, if you like The Who this belongs in the collection just like their 1970s era all-time rock classics.
B00A73PSDO|5.0|... for what its potentially worth in years to come (un-opened)- when sold with an extra copy including disc(s)(which you can pick up cheap enough) then I'd say this particular Pixar steelbook is worth its weight in gold!It is annoying that they distribute that way, as a collector- the idea is that you wouldnt have to open the product to then put the discs inside to then sell it.... Disney!!! sell your steelbooks with the discs in them!!! (muppets, beauty & the beast etc)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really can't add more than all the other 5 star reviews have already said.  I just finished \\"First Shift - Legacy\\" and came on to order Second Shift.  So I thought I'd add my two cents and five stars to the pile for the Omnibus.  Once I finish Second Shift then I'll start on the rest of Hugh's catalog.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Non-stop, raunchy laughter! Had to watch it more than once. Definitely recommend it. Instant video was a plus when deciding upon purchasing options.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been listening to Jon Schmidt and Steven Sharp Nelson individually long before they were part of \\"The Piano Guys\\" and I still love the energy that they put into all their music.  The only thing better than listening to their music is watching their free videos!  Their energy and enthusiasm make listening to their music a joy.  Is every song on here my #1 favorite?  No, but they are all worth a listen!  Great job guys!  Can't wait to hear more!
B0091V6TF4|5.0|I have listened to both CDs several times and well worth the money.  The first CD has all the title music and the second other music that was played during the various movies.  Both CDs are very good.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Very dark and disturbing family issues surrounding Libby after her family is murdered.  She testifies in court that it was her brother.  She was seven years old and the only survivor.  Interesting path to finding the truth about that day.
1439152802|5.0|Since I've been reviewing books from various companies, I've read some pretty mediocre books.  I thought that The Secret Keeper was well on the way to being one of those.<br /><br />I picked it because of the synopsis.  A woman goes in search for the story behind a violent event she witnessed as a girl.  I caught the words \\"love\\" and \\"World War 2\\" and I was in.<br /><br />When I first began reading, I was tempted to quit.  I rarely quit a review book.  There have been a few I've skimmed though.  The Secret Keeper seemed to have a slow start.  It was also written with flashbacks- one of my least favorite writing techniques.  Through the first chapter or so, I considered not going on.<br /><br />When I had made my way  through the first chapters, however; I began to be drawn in to the story.  Laurel's search to find out what happened when she was a young girl was intriguing, compelling.<br /><br />Last night, as my Kindle noted that I was only 60% through the book, I couldn't put it down.  I so wanted to know how the story ended.  Unfortunately, as the clock neared 1 AM, I decided to put it down.<br /><br />When I finally had a chance to pick it up again, I devoured the remainder of the story.<br /><br />The Secret Keeper turned out to be more than just a mystery to solve.  It's a novel of coming of age, of personal growth, of love, and of forgiveness.  It was a wonderful read.<br /><br />As I finished it, I sighed deeply, looked around, and tried to again be present in the real world.  It was difficult after this novel because the story was so captivating and the ending was so wonderful.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this one.  I give it 5 stars and a PG-13 rating.  There is some reference to sex but no description and there are a few inappropriate words.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.  All opinions expressed are entirely my own.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|The Mobo Team did a great job on this one. I had an issue with a .MP4 file not being able to pay due to a separate .SRT file. The problem was solved with a simple click. Thank you Mobo Team!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great book that kept me guessing the entire time... David Baldacci really knows how to keep you on your toes!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following Piano Guys on you tube for a while now. It's always exciting to see what their newest video is, and the arrangements are fantastic! You won't regret buying this, and definitely look up their music videos!
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|Great package deal, brand new. Fantastic movie at an even better price. My friend loved getting it for Christmas. Definitely recommend
B009VB97EY|2.0|I rented this movie in the company of some ladies and gents.  The ladies were really interested in watching it however gents were not very interested.  After some convincing that it was a male-friendly movie.  The fellas budged.<br /><br />It was not at all entertaining to me.  The acting was very poor.  Poor story line.  And lots of dudes dancing around half-naked.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to other men.  Women seemed to like it though.
0545265355|4.0|Skip the movies and just read the books. The story arc is well done and enjoyable to read but the ending left something to be desired. The girl on fire burns hot but the spark is lost before it's over.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Good mic, I am getting good quality sound using it together with zoom h1. I highly recomended. Good quality fast shipment
0525953728|5.0|I bought this book for my husband  he never reads but sat and read this whole book in just a few days.  Anything I can purchase him to keep him reading is a good thing
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I actually saw the movie twice in the theater and then rented it on Direct TV and watched another 2 times.  This movie was a gift to a dear friend for his birthday.  I hope he enjoyed it as much as I did.  If you have not seen it you go and rent it  because you will be missing a truly wonderful movie.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|I can't stop playing it.  Easy to play and the many levels of play make it great for all ages.
B00000K31Q|5.0|There are few films from the 90s and 00s that defined that &#34;High School&#34; movie sub-genre, and &#34;10 Things I Hate About You&#34; is one of them.  Great cast and overall a good, fun film.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Beware. I decided to stop eating wheat by the time I was done reading this. Have you ever tried to stop eating wheat when toast is your favorite comfort food? Now Im hoping to get rid of this wheat belly. At any rate, I'm sure I'll be healthier, having been diagnosed with an unspecific colitis a few years ago. &#34;No!, &#34; said the gastroenterologist, &#34;Eating differently won't effect this condition at all.&#34; BTW,  I've also tried making my own bread with einkorn flour, which can be purchased online. It's delicious! But I think I'll save it for when I've gotten used to being off bread for a while. A no-wheat diet really does seem to result in not needing to eat so many meals and snacks. Maybe there'll actually be some weight loss. That would be a miracle.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love my science fiction books.  This series is by far one of the better ones I have come across.  Couldn't put it down,
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|I expected some kind of twist or something interesting to grab the attention.  Unfortunately, it was pretty much the same old movie.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I love this game. This is easily the game I've played the longest and I keep going back.<br /><br />My only complaint is that with the new update it no longer zooms in and out with the volume buttons.<br /><br />Other than that, I've really liked this game. It's got a slow but steady progress that doesn't leave you bored or overwhelmed. Lots of updates, tons of puzzles, rewarding when solved. Great work!
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I recommend this book to everybody and I wish I can rate infinite stars out of five read all three books
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Too many explanations of Canadian provinces - did not feel this was up to par - disappointed BUT LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|it was hard to play so i didnt keep it for long. I couldnt figure out turn at first and once i did it was hard.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are awesome.  I'm so happy I stumbled onto them last year.  Anytime I want to listen to anything instrumental, I always find myself listening to The Piano Guys.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Very entertaining, nice graphic, nice interesitling story.  Many puzzles which you could either solve or skip as per your choice.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Addictive with good variation of skill levels. Suitable for all ages and abilities. May even help the experienced golfer think outside the box!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I Finished this book in less than a day...i loved it! I recommend it to anyone in between longer novels.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've loved Jon Schmidt and Steven Sharp Nelson for years. Just glad to see them be able to take their talent to the next level. They truly have a gift of being able to turn classical music into something that younger generations will love, by mixing composers like Beethoven and Mozart with modern artists Adele and One Republic. LOVE the Piano Guys!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The best ever for a tablet. I'm addicted. I always loved the cards but this is even better how you can have the cards jump and it keeps store to see how many wins you have. You can set it for a sure win for beginners which is great. Lots of settings like Vegas style or to go back if you made a mistake.
6302994063|5.0|This movie..Strictly Ballroom was a wonderful dance movie. It is set in Australia where dance contest are taken very seriously. Paul Mercurio looks and sets the stage for great Ballroom dancing. The costumes are a bit silly but the energy is truely there. This is not a family movie but for individuals over 18.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Hard to win. I never have. If you're up for a 'real challenge in solitare this is it. I'd say ages 15 and up. I'm 51, but I love the regular solitare. It's fun though you have to try it to see for yourself. All spades so that's different right there. My 24 year old son loves it. I don't.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|The slant of this book on Lincoln tells alot about our sixteenth president. He surrounded himself with the people who ran against him in politics. No yes people for thid guy. Incredible amount of research and work writing this historic story of these incredible times. Connecting the historic dots of the people and events opens your eyes to  decisions and plots surrounding the man.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Kearns' book, though immaculately researched, reads like an historical novel. And that's not a bad thing at all: the history comes alive in this true story of ambition and politics in the 19th century.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have the CD on and my family can just listen all day.  Its beautiful and creates peace in my home.  I love the music and look forward to another CD!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Watch the series first!  The movie is great, but the untimely cancelled TV series was some of the best TV ever.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This is one of best movies, if not the best movie, that I have seen on unconditional love. It exemplifies the unconditional love and devotion that only a canine companion can give. What is very special about this movie, to me, is that it is a true story and for those of us that have been blessed to have had a close relationship with a four legged family member, we know that a special bond does exist between a man and a dog. I believe that DOG's unconditional love is only matched by GOD's unconditional love. If you are fortunate to share your life with a canine companion like Hachico you have been truly blessed. I would recommend movie to everyone.
B001NBEWN6|1.0|Could not get into this book. All the positive reviews must be from English teachers. Felt like a school assignment.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I just could not get into this book, I have to confess that I did not finish it, but speaking to others in my book club they did seem to give it a higher rating.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Its great on my knifes. It work on kitchen knives and my hunting knife, good job it work great. And. They're small they fit anywhere.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Just don't like it.  Maybe should have read the first one first.  Anyway just not my taste!  Three more words required so I say nay...
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I watch the Castle TV series and this book shows how the show is closely based on the TV shows characters.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I had to have this movie as soon as it came out. Few movies intrigue me as much as this one did. Great concept, perfect execution.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. It covers this seals life in the seals and finishes with the raid to get Bin Laden. Highly recommended. Clears up the bull the media and he government has put out on this
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I thought there was too much written about the Secret Service that took away from what the story was actually about
B0088TG252|5.0|Great movie. Great story, acting, as you would expect from any movie starring Denzel Washington. Highly recommended his movie anyone who likes spies and action.
B005JABU82|4.0|I didnt use the stickers sense it looks like I will need to use some special tool with it.<br />But i did finish building the model in just one day so it won't take that long to build it.<br />Pieces are organized and well label and the instructions arent that hard to follow I was easily able to understand the pictures and how it was suppose to go.<br />The only bad thing is that the plastic quality is really cheap:as with all the models<br />And the pieces are very small; because of the size 1/144<br />It does move and work like the one in the show after u finish it. Its also quite something too to show off ur accomplishment =)
B008764ZQ4|5.0|Great movie and sound track. I bought the sound track I liked it so much. I highly recommend this movie.
0385504209|4.0|Recommend this book. Great read. If you haven&#34;t read this book yet go ahead and pick it up. read it
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys have an amazing talent to bring a ray of sunshine into the lives of their listeners. The first music video I ever saw on You Tube was 'Love Story meets Viva la Vida'; after that I was hooked! I pre-ordered this album as soon as I heard it was being released and have listened to it many times since receiving in October. A huge thumbs up to the guys; thank you for creating such beautiful music.
1401937268|5.0|I think this is a well conceived, well executed product and I'm glad I purchased it. You can tell that Doreen put a lot of thought and care into creating these cards.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|...I've seen in the theater in a long, long time! My girlfriend and I could hardly wait to get it on Blu ray, and watching it at home (twice already) has not been a disappointment.<br /><br />I ordered this thru Amazon Prime and it arrived in 2 days and in perfect condition.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|I like all 3 albums, but this one it great to listen to all the way through.  a more polished sound
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Actually, after all the hype of the movie, we were let down.<br />The story line was really weak, we fell asleep 2/3  of the way thru it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - my first by this author.  The format (telling the story from two different vantage points) was a very interesting way to unfold the plot!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I actually didn't have to purchase this app since it was the FAOTD but I would pay $10 for it! Better than any other keyboard, even the stock Android Jelly Bean.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|It's probably not my favorite Reacher novel (I still like One Shot the best) - but this is a page turner nonetheless.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am huge into Harry Potter and scooped this up at a very good price. I get a lot of use out of these DVDs. I just wish there was more books written!
B0044C6V0S|5.0|We got this because it's a very interesting series; Never had problems viewing the chapters...takes a while to download, but it worth it.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|In 1977, George Lucas released a film that pushed special effects farther than ever before, and made an instant classic. One thing that should be noted is that this film brought the sci fi genre back to life, and it's success gave films like the original \\"Alien\\" the greenlight.<br /><br />The plot of this film isn't hard to get into: It is a period of civil war, and the evil empire (lead by the diabolical Darth Vader) is getting stronger and stronger. However, the rebellion won't go down without a fight. After winning their first victory, Princess Leia and a band of rebels have stolen secret plans to the empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored Space Station with enough power to destroy an entire planet! Now, Leia must team up with a band of rebels; the farm boy Luke Skywalker, the theif Han Solo, and wise hermet Obi-Wan Kenobi, to stop the empire before they gain complete control over the galaxy.<br /><br />THE POSITIVES:<br />-The story is very creative, and the script is really tight.<br /><br />-The characters are all great, developed well, and the acting is great. The stand out role here has to go to Harrison Ford as the witty Han Solo, he brings and extra degree of fun to the film (and yes, he DID shoot first).<br /><br />-Overall, the pacing is pretty good, and there is plenty of action to satisfy.<br /><br />-The directing is great as well, George Lucas deserves every bit of credit for his work on this film.<br /><br />-Words can't describe the amount of spectacle Lucas gives us with the effects here. The scenes in space specifically gives us a more open environment in space like never before, and the \\"dog fights\\" with the fighters are extremely well done Audio, video, everything is amazing.<br /><br />THE NEGATIVES:<br />-The pacing is really good MOST of the time. The section on Lukes home planet, Tatooine, is easily the slowest point of the film. Some of these scenes either could have been edited more, or could have have a tad more action. BUT, the opening sequence of the film is great, and the audience can greatly appreciate the build up with the characters.<br /><br />-The acting is good most of the time, but there are still a few lines of dialogue that are delivered ackward, or are just written poorly. But, this is merely a nitpick (especially considering much of the cast here are newcomers) so it's easy to forgive that.<br /><br />THE CHANGES:<br />-This being a Star Wars review, I am pretty much required by law to list the good and bad (mostly bad) \\"Lucas changes\\" to a film trilogy that was already perfectly fine. I don't want to bore anyone with a list of every single Star Wars change that is in this film, but I will address my least favorite change of this film:<br /><br />-Han shot first, period. In the original cut, when Han is held at gun point by a bounty hunter, Greedo, he kills him without mercy. BUT, George Lucas tamered with this scene, and now, Han and Greedo both shoot at the same time, making it as if Han shot in self defence. The change simply looks terrible on screen, and it's very obvious it's been messed with. What made Han Solo a relatable character is that he starts out as a guy who only cares about himself. But, as the film goes on, we see him become a better man. George Lucas' \\"logic\\" with this change is that Han could never kill in such a merciless way. But, isn't the whole THEME of the Star Wars series redemption? And according to Lucas's logic, I guess you can wipe out a bunch of innocent kids and be redemed, but killing a bounty hunter in cold blood is just too much...<br /><br />-Yeah, there are a few CGI dubed parts that are stupid, but I can easily ignore those. And honestly, there are some scenes that extra footage does help clean up some scenes, and makes some of the flying sequences \\"flow\\" better, and some changes help make the Star Wars saga feel like one series. For example, when this film was released, it was simply titled \\"Star Wars\\" and he later had it retirled \\"Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope\\", which I think is a pretty fitting title. But, that's pretty much all the good I can say.<br /><br />In the end, Star Wars was an instant classic, filled with genius film making. There are very few times I would call a film \\"revolutionary\\", but this is definately a film I would say changed the way we view and make movies, and many of the sci fi classics of the 80s might not have been made if it wasn't for Star Wars. If you are a sci fi/adventure film fan, this is a film you should check out. Sure, sci fi films are a dime a dozen now, but the reason why we have films like Avatar are BECAUSE of the original Star Wars trilogy. And to any Star Wars fan, I think this is a set worth getting, simply because it has the original theatrical edition. Yeah, the quality is pretty bad, but not unbearable. Besides, DVD's last much longer than VHS, so as of now, this is the best way to own the original theatrical edition. Although this isn't my personal favorite of the Star Wars series, it still deserves all the credit it gets, which is why I am giving \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope\\" 5 stars.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Okay, I know that nobody will ever read this review, but I have to write it anyway. I bought htis book because of all of the hype.  I wish I had headed the warning reviews. Why do women like this book?  Really? And why is this on the bestseller list?  This is just plain pornography.  I am embarrassed to walk down the aisle with my daughter by this book. She is 14 years old, and is at that crucial age where she is learning to respect herself. She asked me about this book, and we talked about it. (I figured she would find out somewhere, so why not from me?) I told her the story line, with no emphasis on how I felt about it and let her tell me her comments.  She was appalled that women liked this stuff.  She said it sounded like a book that only men would like. I think that this book could have been a good story line without all of the pornographic scenes. My mother-in-law read this and loved it...just makes me shiver thinking about why.  I can't imagine why women like this stuff.  I wish I could return it.  A waste of money!

B005723JSQ|5.0|I love, love, love Sophie Kinsella books.  And I know taht some of her books may not be the best in terms of writing, but I love her humor and wit. When I start reading her books, I am taken away from my everyday boring life, and I feel like I am part of the character's world.  The premise of this was pretty common (think Lifetime TV movie), but again, the humor and wit in her writing is why I continue to read her books. I can't wait for the next book!
B0037MSGH2|5.0|We got this because it's a very interesting series; Never had problems viewing the chapters...takes a while to download, but it worth it.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Every so olften along comes a production which flies in  the face of all we hold dear, and then blows us away with it's fantastic story, superb action and acting, marvelous sets and CGI'd effects.  Robert Downey may seem more at home being &#34;Iron Man&#34;, but his conditioning makes him a formidable Sherlock Holmes as well.  Jude Law makes Doctor Watson seem much more credible, as he should be, and since he is an ex-Army surgeon his decision making must be spot on, or else death takes over!<br />Fortunately for us there is ample backstory to this film, wherein we can see how the London of the 19th Century was magically restored.  The dialog allows the story to move at a quick pace, but yet does not swamp one with too much detail that obscures or confuses the plotline.  Just the opposite!  Holmes brings everything we need to know to the front, leaving only a few sparse details to be unfolded at the penultimate moment.<br />I have loved the old Rathbone/Bruce films for years, and can appreciate the following they built for the &#34;adventures&#34; of the world's first and foremost forensic detective.  The Jeremy Brett/BBC productions also brought a sharp degree of authenticity to the series of adventures — and like the Rathbone films, these also kept basic adherence to the original Conan-Doyle writings.<br />What seperates those fine presentations from the one being reviewed here is — cleanliness!  That wonderful time was not the age of antiseptics, clean water, unspoiled food or clean clothes.  Horses littered the streets (along with their undeisrable leavings), drawing the carriages of the day — and hence their passengers, to the desired destinations.  Sewers were just beginning to come into being, not to mention proper indoor toilets.  Truth be known, the Romans had it much better than Londoners did in Holmes original time!  Yes the film is a bit dark, because those were not the brightest of times!  Plague eliminated whole families and classes of people due to the lack of practical hygiene and medicines to deal with unknown pathogens.  As my parents told me about the Great Depression here in America: &#34;Those were not 'The Good Old Days'!&#34;  So I can aappreciate what the producers went through to see their vision of the time come to fruition.  In my book it succeeds marvelously!  And, if you — like me — find this film outstanding, then be sure to just go ahead and get the 2nd one as well: &#34;A Game of Shadows&#34;.  And, if you have the proper equipment, get the Blu-Ray versions, as they will reveal a whole other world to the viewer who appreciates the fine details and wonderful atmosphere that make a good presentation WONDERFUL!  Five stars seems too little reward for a film of this stature, but because the stars do not interfere with the movie, nothing is lost.<br />(P.S.:  I also liked the film &#34;Sherlock Holmes Smarter Brother&#34;.  That should show that I am NOT biased.)

B000HT3PPG|5.0|I was only 4 years old when this film came out, and so if my folks took me to see it, I do not remember!  However, in the following years it became a popular film to show at Christmas time, and it richly deserves all the adulation it gets.  I can just see the parents at the beginning of the film thinking: &#34;Uh oh. This is going to be a problem.&#34;  You don't want to lie to your children, but you have to give them something to look forward to, and what better person than a jovial Grandfather figure who hands out gifts of encouragement.  I remember a black period in my younger days when being naughty was NOT a good thing at all!  You don't get rewarded for naughtiness!  As with so many other things, it is the parents responsibility to instuct children in the ways of proper behavior, especially right from wrong.  I do not think that Santa Claus is kept a secret for very long, and it is not too traumatic a thing to let the truth be known — eventually.<br />The film is so well cast and produced your worries over what the kids will think soon disappear.  John Payne always seemed to be overlooked as a versatile actor, but this was one of his shining moments.  Maureen O'Hara could always light up a film with her beauty and diction.  As for child actors, Natalie Wood shows a remarkable grasp of what is demanded of her, and delivers a very convincing performance.  Of course, none of this matters without Edmund Gwen — IMHO the best Santa ever!  Throughout all difficulties of having to simply say, &#34;I am who I am&#34;, he convinces us that a straightforward approach is always best.  His simple belief in himself carries over to those he contacts and enriches all their lives — save for the professed psychiatrist!  And as he says, Christmas is not just a time of the year, but a year-round attitude!  If everyone thought that way, we wouldn't get ourselves in some of the predictaments that we do!<br /><br />&#34;Does Macy tell Gimbel's?&#34; is something you always heard growing up in New York.  So it must have come as quite a shock to theater-goers to see them shaking hands and exchanging customers!  (I confess to having done the very same thing every where I worked in my life.  Wonder where I got the idea from...?)  So many films today try to be clever and fail because they do not have the simple characteristics of films like this.  First of all, a great storyline/screenplay; terrific actors, wonderful direction and a production that sets it apart from films NOT shot like this one — lots of live stuff and letting people react naturally.  Could this be done today?  Maybe not.  I think it would require some very special, dedicated people and circumstances to carry it off!<br />As for the film that came after this, the re-make starring Mr. Attenborough is certainly very good, but it does not quite have the appeal of the original — at least not to me.  Re-making a film decades later puts the producers and director in a quandry.  It is ever so hard to re-create the mood/atmosphere/appearance — whatever you wish to call it — that it is best to just go for a complete updating of the story.  For this reason so many classics remain just that — Classic film-making of a story in a certain time.  Consider &#34;The Bishop's Wife&#34;, for comparison.  The remake does not try to be anything more than a facsimile, and in that it succeeds!<br /><br />Getting back to the DVD Special Edition of &#34;Miracle on  34th Street&#34;, the package is just right.  We get a competant colorized version (done in the hues that I feel best reflect the 1940's era) and the original Black & White... We can choose which we wish to see.  I found the colorized version very compelling because of its lack of brilliance or color saturation.  I also own what I consider the best &#34;colorized film&#34; I have yet to see — &#34;The Mark of Zorro&#34; . (also purchased through Amazon!)  The drama of black & white seems best for some films of that day.  (Once again: &#34;The Bishop's Wife&#34;, &#34;Casablanca&#34;...)<br /> As for extras, what more could be asked for than the wonderful Maureen O'Hara giving us a look behind the scenes!  The price being offered by Amazon is a small Christmas Miracle in itself.  And if you order things frequently enough (like I do) then &#34;Prime&#34; makes it even better.  It's hard to convey the 1940's into todays lifestyles and attitudes, but this film should make it easier for Gran dpa and Grandma to explain to the Grandchildren!  Do yourself a favor and get this edition for Christmas this year!  It's lost none of appeal to me over the last 65 years, and I think you might like it as well, given the way the story delivers its message.<br />Hope you and yours enjoy the Happiest of Christmases and a Great New Year!
B009ESIGHI|5.0|The Muppets just don't get any better than this!!!!!  They are at their best when they tell this traditional Christmas story.  I love it!!!!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I went and saw this movie in the theaters with my mom and she loved it so this made the perfect birthday present
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love it!  Addictive.  Can't put it down.  It is so simple yet so much fun to keep trying to beat another level.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This was a story primarily focused on the selfish killing of others in very explicit ways, described in details that are dark and disturbing and diminish the value of both love and life.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I bought this for my wife, she loves Hugh Jackman, the movie is great, lots of great action would recomend it to anyone.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's fun, little glitches here and there but it is pretty fun, upgrades take a bit too much to pay for but I still recommend it.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Muddy Waters was one of the finest Chicago Blues Players ever to lay fingers to strings.  He inspired countless musicians and bands to seek a career in Blues or blues-related fields, including the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Eric Clapton and countless others.  In his later years he ended up opening for many of these bands...a travesty as the bands knew who was the teacher and who was the student.  Many made the statement that the situation should be reversed with them opening for Muddy.  Live at the Checkerboard Lounge featured Muddy in good form, doing what he did best.  The Rolling Stones went to the show, got invited to sit in and the rest is history.  Any video featuring Muddy Waters is worth buying, without exception.  This one is prime, indeed!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|bought this to suurprise our grandson @ thanksgiving.  all the generations loved it as it was assembled.  great nostalgia, great detail exterior and interior and great fun.  lego is wonderful and everyone could relate to the VW camper.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just love Sylvia Day. Bared to you was much more than Fifty Shades. The second book of the series is much more darker with more frustrating twist and turns. Can't wait for book 3!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This group started as a Youtube sensation and has now moved on to create a record!  I love having their sound at my fingertips at all times.  The cello + piano make for a unique blend, and a wonderful way to introduce a different genre to the next generation.  They have taken some big hits and arranged them, as well as created their own music, and let's not forget the blending of multiple songs and genres to create a unique sound and feel.  Absolutely amazing, so glad they were signed and continue to make music for everyone!
B000MQPKVG|5.0|Item arrived quickly and was packaged well. No complaints here! So far all my DVD purchases have been up to my expectations..
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been a long time follower of the Piano Guys on YouTube. They make absolutely amazing music, and this album is no exception.<br /><br />I love how these guys have become successful on their own without resorting to the big record labels that are doing little but stealing from content creators and working to pass laws (SOPA & PIPA) that make it harder for content creators. Sorry. Little tangent there.<br /><br />That being said. The Piano Guys' music style is absolutely brilliant. Their combination of the piano and cello is beautiful, enjoyable, and never gets old.<br /><br />I highly recommend not only purchasing their album, but also checking out their Youtube channel which contains even more music. Simply amazing stuff.
140591243X|5.0|This is the best book ever! Gabriel Emerson's love for Julianne is real, intense, unstoppable. He is gentle, loving and worships Julianne. Gabriel chooses to sacrifice himself so that Julianne's dreams may come true. The addition of art and literature and the study of Dante is captivating. Can't wait for the 3rd book in the series to come out. Author Sylvain Reynard is to be commended on his writing.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are great musicians with a tangible passion for their work. Their renditions of classics and new pop are absolutely stunning. This CD is no exception. It's full of both beautiful and catchy tunes and are great listening for any mood. The music is accessible both to seasoned musicians and to those who listen just for fun. I've never met someone who has given the Piano Guys a chance and haven't fallen in love with their work. Whether you're considering this item to add to your collection or if it's your first experience with them, you won't be disappointed.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|I saw this when it was originally released years ago and if your into war flicks, I highly recommend it
B008XX6J4C|5.0|As one who plays piano and cello, rather poorly I might add(!), their music is sooo refreshing...and the way they choose to \\"play with it\\" and the interaction they have with each other and the ever changing locations only adds to each piece. Their whole team/crew have created SUCH special way of expressing music through not just playing the notes but really getting into each piece...expressing it...feeling it; bringing the listener along for the ride.<br />If you don't know about The Piano Guys...you  MUST SEE, to believe!! Go to YouTube and type in The Piano Guys...there are at least 38 video's. Amazingly fun, incredible and uniquely The Piano Guys!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i love it. so much like the show with alot more detail. it is so fun and exiting. i just love it. it makes you feel like you are a pony with them. just awesome.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this album and I love everything the PianoGuys put their talents into.  You won't be sorry when you buy this music.  Well, you might be sorry they don't have a lot more, but you will definitely enjoy the experience of getting lost in classical melodies that come to life with creativity only the PianoGuys can muster.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I figured the movie had to be at least decent since so many people reviewed the title.  I could not have been more incorrect.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|So happy to own this season. When you get the 2nd season in please let me know. American horror story is the best!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Three books and its done. A great way to end the trilogy nothing really left hanging. It wraps up the story nicely
B004D2A04M|1.0|I use this holder for my Klarus 11 and is does a minimal job. Would want to put anything larger in this holder. But there are problems with this Fenix AB02 holder. In a nut shell, it's cheap,...or I should say cheaply made.<br /><br />I bot this clip &#34;holster&#34; hoping other reviews were wrong. But this is a very minimal flashlight holder that I would not even call a holster. It is a lightweight design. For example, when removing from your belt it's best to somehow get your fingernails underneath end of the release clip and pull to release the clip from your belt. That's not easy.<br /><br />The easy and natural thing when removing from your belt is just grab the side of the holder and pull.  Good holsters take this into consideration in their design to avoid premature failure. But with this toss away AB02 holder all that pulling pressure is transferred to the small swivel pivot pin in the center of the holder and that will rip out quickly,... & the stops will quit holding their positions,...as somebody previously reviewed.<br /><br />There is very little in the way of adjustment for holding lights. There is a 2 inch wide piece of elastic that provides most of the tension to hold the light. But elastic's holding power fades fairly quickly with time & use then you're left with a narrow velcro strip to do the job.  Not good.<br /><br />Over all it's just a &#34;cheapy&#34; product & in my book worth about 3$ and no more.  Somebody will eventually come out with something better one  but haven't found it yet. If you like cheap, go for it.
0321356683|5.0|Java developers should all have a copy of this book with it's clear explanation of best practices.  It's thorough and timeless.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|With all the hope and run up marketing speaking, I found this book predictable and somewhat boring. I probably wouldn't rcommend it.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Ridiculously addicting.  It's like a bad boy night time soap opera for bikers and outlaws.  (Five more words required to post)
B006KX3GXO|4.0|The only thing I don't like about this app is that you need to have tokens for some of the frames.
B0043RSK3K|3.0|this book is informative and eye opening.  good reading for a history class. I would recommend it for a college class
1936608618|5.0|I loved all of the information in this book. Highly recommend this for all athletes and especially those wanting to &#34;get fit&#34; through running. Start here!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Talk about psycho drama!  Except for the adult language - which in my opinion was totally unnecessary to the quality of the storyline - it was definitely a story that kept you reading.  If you don't mind the profanity, it is a masterpiece of storytelling.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great product!! The kindle app is really convenient... Especially when one is on the go.......... I love reading the books.....
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this app rocks i cant belive its only rated 4 stars. i can download easy and convert it to my mp3 player as well.i recommend this for YouTube lovers:)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am addicted to this silly game.  I have to force myself to leave the Kindle alone and get to my &#34;to do&#34; list.  Once I pick up the Kindle and start up this game, I'm lost.
B008469DGY|5.0|This game becomes addictive. Fun, fairly easy, and just hard enough to keep you interested. Great game for the price.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|The ship was really cool. The plot and special effects should have been better.<br />Skip this one and look for another.
B0091CWYQ6|4.0|I have a whole bunch of Fiio products. They are all solid performers relative to their price point.  The Rocky is a great addition to your mobile listening setup...if you need all the features.  Comparing the E02i/rocky to the E6, there's a lot more noise in the Rocky. This is especially true with IEMs, but persists with 32 Ohm Grados. You can mitigate it to some extent by operating without amplification or bass boost.  But then, you lose a lot of what you might have bought the Rocky for. Seeing as you can buy many IEMs with in-line microphones, the Rocky may have aimed a bit more toward the low-impedance on- or over-the-ear headphone market, and if so people with those may not have any background hiss. It is barely audible but since Fiio plays in the budget-audiophile space, I figured I should mention it, especially if you're replacing the much more silent E6/E5 mobile models with this. It is also easier to get bad pops when plugging in/unplugging from the Rocky. They mention this though in the instructions and I would follow that to protect your headphones.<br /><br />But the metal housing, the control layout, the clip, and the bottom-facing headphone input are all very nice features if your primary use is going to be more than sitting at your desk and all worthy upgrades from the E6. The controls are a big step up for on-the-go listening, and the housing is really solid for a product in this price class. The clip could be a little tighter if you plan on using it for something like the gym but will suffice for clipping to your shirt or pants while walking to the office. It is not as tightly clamping as the E5. The battery is a step up from previous models but still suffers in the cold. This affects any battery, but wanted to mention it for anyone who may be walking to work in the cold or using it for skiing/snowboarding to control an iphone buried deep in your coat. The bypass is great for this though; you can boost/amplify to your heart's content and then continue to use the control set even when the battery dies. The E6 blocked your sound once the battery was out.<br /><br />So this is a good product if you need all of the features it offers.  Fiio continues to play smart and keep their prices such that it doesn't hurt to hold on to a few of their products.  I wouldn't put your E6/E5 up for sale, but stash it in the office or your travel bag and make the Rocky your mobile choice.  Just be careful with IEMs.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This film was recommended by a trsuty friend, who knows my taste for sci-fi, philosophy, and intellectual stimulation.  In spite of his well-wishing however, I found this movie to be too much of the same thing.  The bule-black color scheme, the metallic ship that lloks like a ship from the 80's, the typical crew of misfits, the feeling android, the lusty captain, the token black, stilted conversations, ... you get the picture, right.<br /><br />Why should aliens look hominid?  Why must they be the bad guys?  Why ...<br /><br />The production, visuals, editing were good, so I gave it an &#34;okay.&#34;<br /><br />Partially satisfied.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Bit short on battery life but that seems to be par for the course with mini amps in this class. Where the E6 still shines is in its low noise floor.  I generally use this class of amps with IEMs while on the road but o  I have compared this with the E3 and the newest Rocky and even with bass boosted I have a nearly silent background with the E6 and 16 Ohm IEMs.  The Rocky, in comparison, has quite a bit of noise that persists with 32ohm Grados with amplification and bass on. This may be a function of having bass boost, amplification, and a microphone circuit crammed in there. But, there you go.  If you don't need the mic and you don't have any particular preference for the controls (the E3 is significantly harder to manage in your pocket or such) the E3 seems to be the better package for pure listening. A solid worker at an acceptable price point, which seems to be the hallmark of Fiio.
0312427573|1.0|I ordered two books (after hearing a review on NPR) for guys who travel a lot.  NO way can I give them a book nearly two inches thick, almost 700 pages, and weighing a ton.  So sad.
0979019710|5.0|This book will change your life.  If your like me you hate waking up in the morning.  Once in high school I had to have my mom go in and talk to my teachers since I missed so many morning classes from oversleeping.  I was struggling with chronic insomnia almost all my life.  Hal is an inspiration and the miracle morning gives you the tools you need to wake up like its christmas every day!  Not only that, but you will start doing all the things you know you should be doing but put off.  Don't get me wrong, you need to be ready for this book.  You need to willing to actually put the effort it and stay consistent.  But if your a growth minded person and want to take your life to the next level this is the way to do it.  I promise you won't regret buying this book.
B00006JU7T|5.0|This is a great movie with some great acting.<br />Really takes you back into life in New York in the 70's...if you lived there, then you know what it was like.<br />Pacino was fantastic and you knew he was on his way to becoming a star.<br />Where is the USA Bluray for this movie?<br />How come 3 or 4 other countries have it and not in the country it was made.<br />Anybody hear any dates or rumors of it's release?
B007PFD90G|2.0|Boring after the first couple of chapters.  Rushdie comes across as too self-involved and defensive.  He should have waited another 10 years before writing this memoir.
B009JBZH54|5.0|im not sure about all of the other people's reviews, but i didnt have any problems with this. I got everything i asked for 2 days before i was supposed to get it (i missed them yesterday so I actually got it this morning). everything plays fine in my ps3. glad i got this when it was only $30
B0063GORYU|4.0|I use this mostly in Doctors offices or when I'm sitting in a hunting blind waiting for my future trophy to appear.  Nice, and it was free.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is a good game. I like the looks of the dragons. I wish that you could do other things while going through the tutorial.
B009C7JS14|3.0|Nice, for a FREE basic app.  I however needed more, so I bought the full version.  It's a great value for the money.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I've read better of his, but it was a fast and exciting read.  There were many surprises in the road.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I liked it alot and I am a Termintor fan,It is a good show even though there is only 2 seasons.
0547564651|5.0|This book really gets to what works in a child's learning.  I like the back up of research.  I lived this approach to learning and it is nice to see the redearch to back up what I saw in the lives and success of my students.
B004SBX112|5.0|so like I love this game is awesome its the world boss like you can play the different seasons like for example since Christmas is coming up I play most of the Christmas fun its so fun :D ;D &lt;3 :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its free,  and I don't have a calculator anmore because I lost it so this is getting me through Algebra right now. So I'm happy with it!! :D I highly recommend this calculator app.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|This album is over-the-top Christina Aguilera. If you're looking for beautifully sung holiday classics, look elsewhere. Her vocal gymnastics come across as WAY too much, and at times even un-melodic and screechy. The Mel Torme classic The Christmas Song is just butchered with long unnecessary runs that are all over the place and hard to listen to. If you enjoy the sound of cats fighting you may enjoy this album. My advice: save your money on this one.
B000002GK1|4.0|Great follow.up to their last cd. It still has their overall heaviness in both the lyrics as well as the guitar. Outshined is the best and stands out as one of their best ever.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Can't put it down. Now I want to see the movie. Ordering it with my Kindle 3G was fast and easy.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Season one sets the tone for this incredible series. None of the other seasons match the originality of the first season. The season finale is the highlight of who did it.
B008S4FZHI|4.0|Maybe not one of the best Scarpettas but still good.  I enjoyed the read as it had the unpredicatable finish.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|Hea y be tby name. Slayer proves why they are the heaviest band of all time with this thrash classic. The album is just under 30 minutes but it kills! Angel of Death. But Alter of Sacrifi e and Jesus Saves are equally as good.It closes with Raining Blood!!!
B004I1AGTC|4.0|Is this product blu-ray or not. I did not want Blu-ray but when I put it in my computer or DVD it says that it is....good thing I have a blu-ray capable Lenovo and a PS3. Good movie though (already knew that). Arrived quickly.
B00000IMTF|3.0|I like Rainbow but tbeir so.gs are basically the same format. If you like Dio then get this but it gets old.fast.
B008SVFX96|5.0|Richie sounds better than ever.  I love that the members of Bon Jovi can each go do their own thing and then come together and sound as awesome as they do on their own.<br />Richie has been through some difficult times the last few years and no matter who you are - in the limelight or not - it affects everything you do.<br />Richie has turned all that around and into his music and it sounds terrific.
B000003TAR|3.0|I like about half.of the cd. I understand tbat tbey wanted creative control, but it gets too mellow during certain songs. The best real nirvana song is Rape Me.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise.  Yes, there is the obvious sci-fi component, but there was also quite a bit of history in the movie as well.  I enjoyed it.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|Action packed. great humor and it is just an overall action packed roller coaster of fun that is guaranteed to keep everyone in the family entertained.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great read. I loved the first book and now i cant wait to read then third book!
B000003TAB|5.0|This cd kills. Its angry and gets to the point. The songs get to the point. Best song is Dive which can be played over and over.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|I was really hoping for something different but it was the same Bourne theme with a slight twist. I guess I was hoping to see closure on the Bourne movies but instead it left it wide open for future movies and that disappointed me. Jeremy Renner did a fantastic job as always and it really made this movie interesting to watch. Not as action packed as previous Bourne films but still had its moments.
B00000IMTH|3.0|Rainbow does rock, but their music just gets old too quickly. Gates of Babylon is the highlight point of the cd.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It's taken several years to finally get to this point where all the movie/comic book characters come together. I'm sure it will give many more years of entertainment as the Avengers battle their foes.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Great read! I normally wouldn't have read this, but it was recommended to me, so I did. I am so glad I read it; it easily transforms you to the trail and you feel like you are hiking right along with Cheryl.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|The guys who thought this up were really out there.  I would never have put two such different characters together. All in all it was a really well thought out movie and I liked how they integrated much of the past history into this fantasy. I'd recommend this film but definitely not for kids, it is very graphic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read this one in one day. by far the most drama packed book in the trilogy. this one will make the best movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|a little disappointing for grisham. i will continue to read his novels. good characters, he developes good plots  but this guy was so superior to work out all the angles, maybe a bit unbeleivable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one had a better storyline than the first book. More suspense and drama.  the third book is my favorite though
B00003CY5J|2.0|THis was very dark and cheerless.  Good suspense and acting but not one I would recomend. It is too bad faul language has to be put in when it does nothing to contribute.  I get the fact that many people talk that way in these situations, but it serves no purpose to have it in this movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Slightly embarrassing to read but I couldn't put it down. the first chapter is pretty boring but the first book sets you up for all the drama in the trilogy.
B006ZT47O0|3.0|Epica is my all-time favorite band, so I'm not going to outright bash them, but what I see this album as is just slightly above an average release. I understand that Mark Jansen was also busy writing for MaYaN while this was being written, and so it makes sense that it seems half an effort.<br /><br />Let me continue by stating that Delirium, Monopoly on Truth, Dark Water Horizon and, of course, Serenade of Self Destruction are all amazing compositions that I enjoy. It's not that it is bad music, it is just the fact that it seems as if Epica did not try their absolute hardest on this release.<br /><br />That said, I still listen to this album a lot, it just doesn't scream Epica at me.
B000MQ58VS|5.0|This movie has some of the best actors and the best acting that I've seen in years.  We loved getting the blu ray.
B006JJBFK0|4.0|I really enjoyed this album, had it on repeat for months after purchasing. Some say it isn't original and that it's &#34;copying Nightwish&#34; but that does not take from the fact that it is solidly well produced, enjoyable, and very accessible. Lisa Middelhauve, though an amazing and talented vocalist, never seemed to me that her voice was strong enough. Manuela however holds her own and shines with beautiful strength and emotion.
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|We have had the dvd of this movie since it first came out.  It's amazing the improvement in the clarity.  The movie holds up over time.  It's just a good movie.
B004RJZA1E|5.0|I found them randomly on YouTube around a year ago and I was hooked instantly. There's just so much variety and yet it is so smooth, both in composition and production. While each song has basic structure and similar melodies (especially in the choruses) this release is solid and very, VERY engaging and addictive. I've listened to each song at least 70 times as of the time of this review. Standout tracks are Leave Everything Behind, Hunger, Amaranthine, and Act of Desperation, but each and every song has something special and each is very enjoyable. Looking forward to their follow up album for sure!
B0042AGNAK|4.0|This is one of those strange movies that Cage is known for.  My sister loves it and I'm not that into it.  Sam Elliott is the best part of the movie.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is a terrific writer.  Precise detail.  Characters you love and empathize with.  The action is non-stop and I can never wait to turn the page or start the next chapter.  I just never want his books to end.  I have read every single one and the only problem I have is waiting a year for the next one!<br /><br />Love Flynn and Rapp.<br /><br />The Last Man by Vince Flynn
B001LL9YP4|3.0|I bought the version with the \\"I Love the '80's\\" cover. The movie presentation is in a letter boxed 4X3 format rather than a true anamorphic widescreen. Movie's not bad with a great car chase scene, but the presentation format was disappointing. The 2nd disc in the \\"I Love the 80's\\" version is an audio CD with 4 songs on it (Lips Like Sugar, Chains of Love, Need You Tonight, Take On Me).
0553801473|5.0|Sure, his prose isn't as technically proficient, but in terms of sheer power of imagination and force of description, Martin is the only fantasy writer in the world who is deserving of comparison to the father of modern fantasy, J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />The Song of Ice and Fire series is a masterpiece. In this, the 5th volume, the true depth of Martin's creation becomes apparent. We are looking at a work for the ages, folks.<br /><br />Immerse yourself. Throw away your expectations and let the story wash over you. Above all, be patient. The wait for the next book will be long (three years, at least), but it will be worth it.<br /><br />I envy those of you who have yet to experience this book. You're in for a treat.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is great and I got it for a great price on Amazon.com<br />The quality and the easy access to all of the easily viewed copies made it a good choice.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great album, I've been listening to their music for quite a while now and the album was a nice touch! It's nice to support artists who put a lot of work into their music!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|A standout : all new material, magnificently recorded and performed. It is not a walk down memory lane. More a continuation of the walk of life. Whether you joined the walk 10 years ago or, like me, 50 years ago, this music will make you appreciate the beauty of the endless summer and the timeless appeal of the Beach Boys..
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|would I ever buy the coins for this.game?  No. It's fun but I wouldn't spend money on it. I think that's. dumb. just walk away from the game for a few and you will earn up to 41 coins.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, as I didn't know much about it before watching it. I knew it was a &#34;western&#34; and it was supposed to be good, but that was about it. I have to say, it's not what I expected, but that's not a negative. Shia and his brothers are moonshiners in the prohibition era. There's a little bit of gun fighting, a little bit of romance, some gangsters and a fair amount of violence. It all works together very well, although I thought it got a little slow in the middle. Overall, a good movie and I would recommended it others. Forest (Tom Hardy) was my favorite character by far, he's a total badass.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham's style is captivating and simple.  The first half of the book was very easy to follow and I thought I knew what was going on, but then the true plot started unfolding and I had to hold onto my chair.  I didn't know what to expect from the ending, as I thought there would be an even more dramatic turnaround, but I was glad it did not happen.  Suffice it to say I loved how it turned out.<br /><br />They'll probably make a really bad movie out of this book, like they did with The Firm.  But the book is fun, suspenseful, and exciting.  If you liked his other legal thrillers, you'll love this one.
B0076DELIG|5.0|i love Harry Bosch and MIchael Haller.  can't get enough of Michael Connelly books.  i read EVERY one as soon as they come out.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Trying to download everything before viewing. Would have been better to provide an option to just stream live. Overall it is and OK app to have.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Grand daughter really likes this group, would give to any of my friends who wanted good music. thank you much.
B004EBZX6W|2.0|Shows you the signal strength of all available WiFis. The app needs more clarity. Not very helpful. Would not recommend
B005ARYEPK|4.0|I love this movie.  Kevin Bacon made the movie more real for me.  However I am a big fan of his any way.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|This was a pleasant surprise.  It was good enough that if the Halo game was playable on my PC I'd of bought the game to continue the storyline.<br /><br />The show took the time to introduce you to the characters, give some background to their life situations, and then out of the blue, wham!<br /><br />I give this 5 stars because it was actually written and directed like a show, and because so uncharacteristically to the science fiction/fantasy genre it did a good job establishing character development, action, threw in some jump out of your chair thrills, and left you a little hungry for more.
B005OZ4E3A|5.0|This is the latest CD by Pausini and is a great CD to own.<br />I just can't tell how many times I play it and enjoy it everytime!
B000BNI99K|5.0|I've listened to Rod from way back. mom never got him! but now she loves him! since he came out w/old songs w/ his voice and great orchestra to back him! a must for the songlover and Rod lover as well. a good listen!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I really enjoyed it, but I think it's a book meant to appeal to a much smaller audience. It's not really anything like Harry Potter and very much a book for adults. There's very little plot (I'm pretty sure I could summarize the whole book in one sentence). There's not a ton of action or anything out of the ordinary. Instead this book is a character study. Rowling captures Life. It's that simple. Just life. What it means to live, what it means to have hope, to love, to feel pain, to be ashamed etc. etc. There's no need for anything \\"major\\" to happen because life in itself is a series of celebrations and tragedies. It's hard to like any of the characters because we see what they think, but then again, it's hard to like anyone once we get a glimpse at what they're really like. It's simply humanity: we're not perfect, no one is. And so, Rowling is brutally honest about what society is really like. She plays with the way people perceive others and even the way, people perceive themselves. This book is proof of her great writing skills because by the end, I found myself really caring for some of her characters, even with all their imperfections. And isn't that one of life's biggest challenges? Learning to love others, learning to trust people even when we know that they will eventually fail us? Not all the characters change. Not all the conflicts are resolved by the end. It's more like Rowling captured one moment, one glimpse, in the much-less-than-perfect lives of the citizens of Pagford.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|A great movie if you enjoy Harry Potter type movies. It also makes a good present for your friends if they enjoy this stuff.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have made me smile so many times. Their music is upbeat and fun. They give a new twist to classical music in a good way. They put a lot of thought into this album and it shows.
B000TTRGUE|4.0|These are very good mics for the price. Well packaged, good sound quality and very durable. They do not have an ON & OFF switch thou and that is there only drawback.
B007V65R54|4.0|It is impossible to give this book a single rating. I bought it to find out why Nate is such a successful pollster but the book really isn't about that. On the one hand, it is must reading for anyone who wants to learn about the inherent inaccuracy in forecasts and predictions and why the more precise they are the more we should doubt them. In today's polarized world this information is incredibly important, hence the &#34;six&#34; stars for this part. The next part is a long and tedious analysis of applying his technique (Bayesian) to everything from poker to terrorism. This part is too long and detailed for most readers (hence 3 stars.) This is a terrible shame because everyone needs to read the first part about the predictions and forecasts they see in the media.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This is a very good DVD collection. Well put together and if you enjoy this type of action then this is for you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story unfolded crisply, with sharp unexpected turns the whole way. Felt a sense of panic that was eerily genuine even though I knew it was fiction. What a ride!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I read the series.  But, quite honestly, I'm not sure if Kay is getting old or if Patricia Cornwell is tired of writing the books.  There is no adventure, no real drama and the ending was pulled out of the hat.  I don't even remember who the killer was from the story.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|While a feast for the eyes, the movie fails to initiate a new fan base and serves to confuse a great portion of the base left that was excited for a new &#34;Alien&#34; movie. While not marketed as a prequel to Alie, the film certainly lives in the same universe and is a strong first cousin. The characters could have used more development and a great many that get killed off have no meaning to the viewer as they were used only as window dressing to start with. The twists and turns of the movie leave the viewere bewlidered and only those few who have a special interest in tracking down rare ind-european languages will be able to know what is said between the Engineer and David and the rabid alien fans will seek to understand the questions that are elf tunanswered at the end of the movie. Charlize Theron was not used ot her full potential and culd have easily been a top rate villan while Noomi Rapace held her own.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Our whole family loves The Piano Guys. (We range in age from 13 to 52.) Their latest album has some of the best music ever. Perfect for everyone's music library.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|this is a very User friendly app. I like that it allows you to use already purchased music as alarm tones. I wake up yo jack Johnson every morning.!!!!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Still love this movie after all this time even though I have to admit I feel sooo old lol :)
B008XX6J4C|5.0|You won't regret this purchase! A great gift for all ages! Every song is unique, and addictive! After buying this, you'll want to check out their other songs (if you haven't already!!!!) :D
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Continuity of storyline takes backseat to over-the-top special effects.  This could have been a great movie with good direction.  Annoying.
B00005K424|5.0|Quarto was delivered on time and in great shape.  As far as this game... I Love it!  There is nothing like playing someone face to face in a non-digital way.  A great gift.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I love the eighties mainly and I remember how good the music was so I got this cause mostly all her songs are good
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|There is a lot of great action scenes that actually look believable. Especially because of one of the characters. All actors played great roles.
030758836X|3.0|In reading Gone Girl, by Gillian Flynn, I love this book, it's a great surprise for me. Gillian is a very talented writer. Also Flynn, a gifted writer.<br /><br />I don't know how to rate this book. I'm very sorry I'm giving 3 because the book was well writing.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I've been loving reading this books.  I really appreciate that they are all in order, which makes it very easy to read them sequentially.  I am somewhat disappointed however in the typos that appear.  I find I can read quite quickly but when there's a typo it takes a moment to reconcile what it should be, disrupting my reading.  They are not major typos, thankfully, but disruptive nonetheless.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I have read quite a number of reviews on this product, and it seems to be 50/50 for whether it works well or not.  I guess I received the better 50%.  It works great for me on my Kinect.  With the way I have my entertainment room set up, I lack depth from the TV.  This Zoom allows me to utilize a smaller playing space and it works perfectly.  I cannot speak for anyone else, but I can encourage you to try it for the price.  What is easier, trying this out, or changing your room/setup?
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|You see this game all the time in arcade-type places, but I've never been interested. One day I down loaded this and was almost imediately absorbed. Surprisingly fun way to pass the time. Only thing missing is an explination/use for the dozer dollars.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love the recurring character John Corey and as usual he is always entertaining. I love his sarcasm. The events and background of Yemen are intriguing. Great Book!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|One of the best Christmas films of all time and one of my favourites! If you haven't seen it yet, you really should!<br />A true classic, with a timeless message of charity,hope and faith triumphing over selfishness, greed, disappointment and despair.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I bought a ProScan tablet and was happy to see I could send the Amazon app to it and then download and activate my kindle books.
B007MJSQSK|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie and perhaps in general that is the best way to enjoy a movie.  It is a fast paced movie that is not too complicated but instead invites you to relish the ride, enjoy the characters and guess at what's next.  I enjoyed the fact that the movie was well thought out and that the language and content was clean.  The action sequences allowed for the surreal and took advantage of CGI's flexibility.  Looking forward to more.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|I should have read the reviews prior to downloading since I didn't know it was not really &#34;free free&#34; but only temporarily &#34;free&#34;.
1599218011|4.0|This book is all about how to redeem your body the way G-d intended it to be through diet and exercise. The author was diagnosed with an incurable, barely researched liver cancer and is still living to tell about it. However, she is not only living day to day, she is living vibrantly, healthfully, and loving life. If we could all have this attitude and zest for life then we would all be better off. She doesn't necessarily get you with too many details, but there is enough that you will want to do further research. However, she definitely hooks you in emotionally and gives you the basic understanding and very clear means to excel at changing you dietary and attitude plan with a 21 day rendition of directions. She writes in snippets, easy to read and dynamically focused. Read this book.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I love Amazon and this movie. It is my favorite Christmas movie. I received the package in a timely matter; however, when I opened it I could hear the movie bouncing around inside the case. I opened it and discovered the case was broken and the movie will not stay in place. Hopefully this movie will not become scratched and unwatchable.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie was definitely worth watching.  It was not a waste of money or time.  However, it could have been really great with a better, more unusual plot
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show! I keep asking myself, &#34;Where has this show been all my life?&#34; Best show ever ever!
0547995660|4.0|This is the second time I have bought this book. The first time was for another granddaughter several years ago. I like to see what young teens are reading, so I read it before I gave it to her. It was very thought-provoking. When I saw it on this granddaughter's Christmas list, I knew I should get it for her. It is a Newbery award winner, so you can't go wrong.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Engaging characters, interesting plot, meaningful messages, thought-provoking ideas, and a smooth writing style all combine to create a classic. Hugh - you said you read all these reviews, so please, please, please continue the story!  But until then, I look forward to reading your other works.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The original book that started it all. Earth is in trouble, the Formic's must be defeated but we need a leader. That boy is Ender Wiggins.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|The Reacher series gets you started fast and keeps you interested through the whole book.  I've lost a lot of sleep with Jack.  :)
B003H4I4JU|5.0|3000 years after the Formic Wars Ender is still traveling the universe searching for a home for the hive queen.
159562015X|5.0|I bought several copies to share with some young adults I work with.  They have all found it extremely helpful.  I would definitely recommend it for young adults who are trying to determine what to do with their lives.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|This Christmas, I wanted to treat myself to something I always wanted as a child and the Lego space shuttle was perfect for that! The instructions are clear and easy to follow, lots of fun to assemble, you just need a little patience!
1401937519|5.0|I read the book &#34;Dying To Be ME&#34; on the recommendation of a cousin who lost her husband to cancer. It has been a great solace to her and to others who have lost a loved one. I gave my copy to a neighbor who is fighting breast cancer. When I told her about the book she was less than enthousiastic and asked if I was in a hurry to get it back. I told her to keeep it as long as she wanted to. About a week later I phoned her to see how she was doing and she told me how glad she was that I had loaned it to her and was going to recommend it to several other people she knows. I also sent it to a friend who is fighting cancer in Hawaii and another friend who has AIDS in San  Francisco. When I spoke with Gil he told me of his own Near Death Experience.
0061906220|5.0|This is not a complicated book.  Its a kids book where the protagonist (pete) encounters a number of problems but decides that the results are all good.  This was one of the more important books I read this year.  Kind of silly but worth reading and re-reading.
0375822070|5.0|Like Roald Dahl's many other books, the Fantastic Mr. Fox does not disappoint. It is a great read-aloud chapter book and is very accessible. We first read it with our daughter when she was about five. She continues to love the story.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|A far superior alternative to the ridiculously expensive Amazon case. I have a Marware case for my original Kindle Fire. The standing feature in this case is far superior. I find the auto-wake feature works fine as long as you are in a well lit area. If the light is dim it sometimes doesn't work. The auto-sleep is hard to test. Sometimes you're going to have to use the button. The few flaws seem to be with the Kindle 7\\" Fire HD. They made the operating buttons effectively invisible. You just have to memorize where they are and/or feel around for them. They did away with the charging indicator and mounted the camera opposite the charging/HDMI ports. Still, I love my new Kindle and gave my old one to my daughter. No big deal. Also, you can use the chargers used with the original Kindle Fire with this one, albeit at a lower wattage.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I tried the game and it worked for a while then it broke so I redownloaded it , but it still didn't work.
0316069434|5.0|20 years ago, in 1992, Harry Bosch was working on a special detail handling homicides during the LA riot.  There were lots of cases, and they had to be handled quickly.  Most were never solved.  One case was a woman photo-journalist from Denmark, and something never seemed right about the case.  Now it is 2012 and Harry is back, post retirement, working under contract to reopen cold cases.  His previous lieutenant is gone ([[ASIN:1409136493 Drop]]), and his new lieutenant wants to make numbers to justify his budget - something that does not sit well with Harry and his colleagues.  Harry has drawn the case of the photo-journalist from 20 years before and has become somewhat obsessed with the case.<br /><br />Harry is looking for the \\"black box\\" - the piece of evidence needed to break open the case.  He believes in following the gun, i.e., trying to trace the murder weapon.  Clues are slim, but digging through the original file cards from the case does produce a lead that Harry needs to follow.  In the meantime there has been a complaint that Harry made improper use of official time.  So once again Harry is under investigation - not unusual as Harry tends to follow his own procedures - something he learned from his mentor back when he was a rookie.<br /><br />You do get some additional content about his personal life, including his mis-steps with women including his daughter.  There is a little background on why Harry went into police work after returning from Vietnam, and some side information about jazz music including the saxaphonist Art Pepper [[ASIN:B0059M4KRI The Capitol Vaults Jazz Series]], [[ASIN:B000000X90 Complete Village Vanguard Sessions]], etc.<br /><br />There is a usual blazing finish.  Harry gets in a little over his head, and makes some mistakes (the problem with getting older) that put him in peril.  There is a wrap-up at the end, and maybe another new woman in his life.  We shall see.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Original take on a post nuclear world. I've read a lot of SF and I can't recomend  these novels too highly.  Buy the omnibus edition now!
B005E94WB0|3.0|This looked like a pretty good thing.  I kept dropping my earpiece out of my pocket and wanted something that was convenient to retreive my earpiece when the phone rang.  Unfortunately it is still a hassle with the carrier.  The good news is that at least it is better protected now.  I do wish it had a beltclip.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the piano guys so much. They never cease to amaze me, they create such wonderful music. It gives me the chills! Definitely a must buy album. What are you waiting for??
B008S80OU2|5.0|While I won't go into any technical aspects of this huge release (my only real complaint would be that they should have RE-remastered the first five CDs to match the new 2012 mastering, but......) this set has given me the opportunity to revisit all those mid/late-period albums that I'd sorta forgotten over the years, having relegated myself to listening to bits and pieces of the albums from \\"Spectres\\" on. I first discovered the CULT (to me, there is only ONE band called \\"The Cult\\") the day the first album was released, so the first three records became my favorites all along, while I found their later output, with their increasing reliance on outside producers, writers and lyricists, as well as their turn to a more pop-rock-oriented direction, to simply not interest me like the mysterious and dark early albums. But revisiting the later records from this set has given be a whole new appreciation for this great band, probably my favorite American group of all time, and certainly undderrated in terms of imagination, and shear talent (Buck Dharma is easily one of the best guitarists EVER). Whether it's a ripping Buck solo, a nice melodic chorus break, some kind of mysteriously cryptic lyric, or just another nice Bloom vocal, I've been reminded that there is SOMETHING to latch onto in almost every song by The Long Island Leather Boys. Damn, I've even discovered that I actually like several songs on the much-maligned \\"Club Ninja\\" now! And overall, the remastering is great (particularly nice to have a much-needed re-do on the great live \\"On Your Feet\\" album). But still....there's the question of their increasing change of direction that led me to put them to the back of the listening pile for many years (other than \\"the early trio\\"). And it got to me to thinking: how great would the later albums be if they had simply been produced by Sandy Pearlman?? I mean, the producers they brought in for these releases seemed like solid choices on paper: Tom Werman of Motley Crue fame- who ends up producing their lightest album yet, \\"Mirrors\\"! Martin Birch (Deep Purple/Rainbow) actually did a pretty admirable job returning them to the dark themes and heavier sound in albums like \\"Fire of Unknown Origin\\", so he actually gets a pass, although his two efforts simply don't match the brilliance of what came before. Bruce Fairbairn, on the other hand, was a pretty BAD choice, having spent his entire career (one of EVIL, I might add) injecting a disingenuous pop sheen into albums by the likes of Bon Jovi and Loverboy, ruining any hopes that \\"The Revolution by Night\\" would turn out to be as good as it's front cover. So, yeah...if only they had stuck to their guns, decided that hits did not matter, and brought Pearlman back for every album. But, what we have is what we have, and for a career spanning 40 years, this boxset serves to remind us that B.O.C. was (is?) one of the most creative, challenging and talented groups in the world. And so, I've taken away two things from my almost-revelatory rediscovery of my nearly favorite band: I actually dismiss very few of the Cult songs now, AND, I'm starting to think seriously again of actually going through with my long-considered B.O.C. symbol tattoo!!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Definitely not for me.  And not well written, in my humble opinion.  In fact, I wasn't interested enough to finish reading it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this, and play it every day up in my studio while I am painting!  These guys are so talented.
B008COIWZ6|4.0|I was bored so i decided to give the movie a shot it isn't on par with the Avengers but all in all it was not a bad movie the ending surprised me a bit but will be watching for more from this director
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|it's very flimsy, you can't make a straight cut. i highly recommend one that lays on it's back and has a sturdy base.<br />i've watched all the youtube videos but still can not get it to work.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|a beautiful dark movie that shows how people can really get when pushed tocertain limits. Or really just a great all around movie.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The sound quality is excellent, especially through bluetooth headphones. I look forward to the next update, very curious as to coming improvements.
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|loved it 20 years ago and still love it today. It is nice to have a live cd from 20 years ago.<br />Megadeth sounds good anytime.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Seems sturdy. It has such a sleek look to it and fully protects your kindle. So far I believe it's worth the buy!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The movie was one of the best of the Batman series. Dark and serious it seemed to belong to a real world
1452110581|5.0|This was definitely worth the money. Bought it for my husband and we laughed while we read the different poems. Definitely a good investment.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|While this was an interesting story it was not quite on par with Mitch Albom's other books. Enjoyable for easy reading.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|It installed fine on my kindle fire I did like the simplicity of the game even though it is choppy at times when yo move. There are a lot of these types of games in the market as well as Amazon APP store which makes you move boxes and other objects to solve puzzles. This one does not really stand apart from anyone in terms of puzzle solving but I do like the simple interface and manageable small size app. There is no unwanted permissions and is worth the download if you like puzzles. The reason the rating falls on this game falls by one star is due to the way scoring is done. The game scoring system doesn't actually count how many times you move the blocks, it counts how many moves you move a piece out of its starting spot!!!! and counts less or more depending on where it ends up. This drove me nuts and I feel this needs to be fixed by the developer in the next update.<br /><br />For now, I am going to keep it in the cloud and wait for app update to try the game again later.
141659521X|5.0|I havenot started this book, but I fully expect it to be as good as the ones preceeding it.  I foloow this author and look forward to each release.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game its awesome! but are some people that stupid not to figure out how to do it.
0547564651|5.0|Great book about an overlooked skill set in our children.  The focus on academic tends to overshadow the critical characteristics for success.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|The fact that orbs go through each other is a game breaker. I've played several of these bubble bobble clones and have never seen this before. If they ever fix it, I'll have to go back and update this review appropriately.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many great ideas on Pinterest.  I love to cook and have found some amazing recipes and blogs on Pinterest.
0345803507|3.0|I have not read the third book in the trilogy yet. the first two are  examples of literary expertise, the character talks like a teenager, not a 20-something year old, the plot is weak. However, it is entertaining and captivating. The second book is better than the first and i hear the third should be read.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I don't usually follow American Idol, but when I happened to see Phillip's audition, I was hooked. This guy has talent. The best way to describe him to the un initiated buyer, would be a good mix of Dave Matthews and Mumford & Sons, but enough originality to not get bored. The entire album is good. Worth the purchase, and multiple listens.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|This is a good story, told by a woman, ostensibly, anyway. I found it fun to read, in places brilliant, but it wasn't as moving as On Chesil Beach, my favorite McEwan by a long shot. It didn't seem as deeply felt, though as always he is a better writer than most people writing today, so even his less than perfect novels are very good reads.
B00008OE4W|4.0|\\"Sneakers\\" was brought to us in 1992 by the folks who wrote \\"WarGames\\" in 1983 and is probably the second important hacker film, a subgenre that was sparsely populated back then. \\"Sneakers\\" are a team of black hat-ish hackers and security experts who hire out their services to companies who want to test their security systems. Marty Bishop (Robert Redford), a first-generation hacker who got up to mischief in the 1960s and had to flee to Canada, owns the operation, and, one day, two men claming to be NSA agents insist on hiring him. He is to retrieve a device from a crypto mathematician named Gunter Janek (Donal Logue) in exchange for $175,000, to keep decryption technology from falling into Russian hands. After consulting with his team, Marty reluctantly takes the job, only to find the situation more complicated and the technology more powerful than he expected.<br /><br />\\"Sneakers\\" was in development for 9 years. Walter F. Parkes and Lawrence Lasker, who co-wrote \\"WarGames\\", conceived of the film as a result of research they did on that film. Phil Alden Robinson ended up finishing the script and directing the film, while Lasker produced. This is a high-concept, relevant story, so it's difficult to imagine why it took so long to get the film off the ground. But once it was, it seems that everyone was eager to participate. It's an all-star cast, with Sidney Poitier playing second to Redford as ex-CIA agent Donald Crease. Dan Ackroyd is the team's conspiracy-spouting technician. Ben Kingsley is Marty's old hacking buddy Cosmo. David Straithairn is the team's blind phone phreak \\"Whistler\\". River Phoenix plays the team's young apprentice Carl, the only GenXer among Baby Boomers. He seems hazy, presumably due to his drug problem.<br /><br />Parkes and Lasker tried to cram every interesting tidbit that they discovered about phone phreaks, the security industry, and cryptography into these characters. And they question who controls information and who has access in the Digital Age. This is admirable, but it is sometimes an awkward fit. Occasionally they resort to just having characters mouth the themes, such as: \\"The world isn't run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money. It's run by little ones and zeros. Little bits of data. It's all just electrons.\\" And \\"there's a war out there, old friend. A world war. And it's not about who's got the most bullets. It's about who controls the information...It's all about the information!\\" They sound like cypherpunks -a year before the Clipper Chip was announced. We would have to wait 20 years for domestic surveillance by the NSA, but \\"Sneakers\\" was prescient there.<br /><br />Weaving complex themes and iconic digital underground types into a formulaic caper plot can produce a hokey effect. The characters are a little thin. Mary McDonnell, as Marty's ex-girlfriend Liz, seems thrown in there just to have a woman in the cast. The capers are not as suspenseful as one might hope. But I commend the filmmakers for their efforts to make their real-world inspirations authentic on screen. The prison experiences of famed phone phreak John Draper, AKA Captain Crunch, were the inspiration for the Cosmo character. Robinson consulted Ricky Jay about a slight of hand trick in the first scene. He went so far as to hire cryptographer Len Aldeman of RSA fame to write Janek's lecture and his slides. Wrap it up in a classic caper plot, throw in some humor, a great cast, and you've got a fun, provocative movie that ages well thematically, if not technologically.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal Collector's Edition 2004): \\"The Making of Sneakers\\" (40 min) interviews writer/director Phil Alden Robinson, writer Walter F. Parkes, and writer/producer Lawrence Lasker about the film's conception and long development, the writing process, characters, and where their inspirations came from. There are also brief interviews with John Draper, Len Aldeman, and the cast. There is an audio commentary by Robinson, Parkes, and Lasker as well. They discuss the multiple functions served by each scene due to so much plot, characters, plot, some camerawork, and make comparisons to early drafts of the script. The focus is on the writing. There is a theatrical trailer (2 ½ min). Subtitles are available for the film in Spanish and French. Captioning available in English. Dubbing available in Spanish and French.s well.

B007HGPBRC|5.0|I found it extraordinary that someone could write with such feeling and at the same time such dispassionate intelligence about his life and impending death. His was one of the most honest voices I have ever heard. Highly recommended. Utterly without sentimentality.
B00A757EFW|4.0|....just not the FULL version. Of course the &quot;upgrade&quot; to full will cost you.<br /> However, it runs nice and smooth on my Kindle Fire and the fingertip directional control was very easy to use. You can also change the directional control to fingertip swiping.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is an excellent example of the talent of five men who each have distinct skills. They mash them together to create some of the most uplifting music and videos in their genre. You may be wondering...what is The Piano Guys genre? Well, it isn't accurate to say they fit into the classical group. At the same time, neither the Pop or New Age categories properly describe the artistry. In my own mind, I call it Uplifting Classpop Fusion.<br />  I first became aware of these guys when a friend sent me a link on Facebook. I haven't stopped listening since, and own every bit of music they have released for purchase. If you are the least bit curious, give the album a listen. I think you will be hooked; they are THAT good!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Thanks, this was exactly what i order and it was substantially cheaper than i could find it anywhere else. ill definitely purchase products from here in the future.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the talent of these men, you almost feel smarter after listening to them....and you definitely feel so much happier!
B004UXUUDA|5.0|It's sad that this movie did not fare better in the movie theaters.  I'm sure it was largely due to the fact that it is about half and half in the French and English languages.  It's a wonderful, tender, heart-warming yet tragic story.  Take the time and energy (is reading a few subtitles THAT difficult???) to watch this movie and be greatly rewarded for your time.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites because it shows how dangerous it can be to find treasure at sea.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this movie FOUR times in the movie theaters, with various friends.  It has the great British wit and is heartwarming and teaches many lessons in addition to entertaining us.  Give yourself a treat and watch the movie!!
B002M5E2DW|2.0|I thought it was going to be a story but instead it was more of peoples opinions.  Not at all what i expected
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Great songs, love the harmonies and lyrics and style of these talented folks.  One of my favorite, feel good kind of CDs.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|product fit right in & is working great. sad I had to buy them in a 3 pack, but i guess that'll keep me stocked up for the next 4-6 years.  I hope my headset keeps going that long too, it's about 2.5 years and counting!  I'd buy these again if I ever had the need for more.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Not bad but like Rio better. The game is ok but like the different games available in Rio. Much more exciting, this one is bland.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a awesome and funny book. Jeff you are a wonderful author. Make more books and movies. Good Luck man.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Why i love this game is i play uno with my grandma my mom my sister my teacher and on the kindle fire.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|McAfee and Brynjolfsson offer a clear and clearly supported thesis: we will lose a race against machines for work, leading to \\"technological unemployment\\", because of the sheer scope and speed technologies develop. To win, we must race with machines, using technological innovation to generate innovative enterprise, and thus, new jobs.<br /><br />There is a lot of data to back up their arguments, which, important in itself, is even more useful for the e-book version because they've hyperlinked citations, allowing you to jump right to the source. Because of this, I thoroughly recommend the e-book, and do not recommend the hardcopy; evidently they agree, as they don't offer a hard copy of the book on their website, and Brynjolfsson even disparages its physical limitations in a lecture.<br /><br />Excellent value for $5. It's a concise and short read, with interesting and memorable examples. If you're looking to spark interesting conversation with economists, or just your friends and family, you'll be able to express their points easily.<br /><br />It loses a star because its overall investigation is shallow. This is a descriptive book much more than a normative one, and I would have liked to have seen them confront the argument that technological unemployment is an inherent structural deficiency of capitalism, perhaps even a cause for its undoing (whether they agree with that or not, and I don't think they do). They offer \\"solutions\\" at the end, but they are glibly delivered and have the feel of band-aids.
B000AP04NI|5.0|I purchased this a gift. It arrived quickly. It is sometimes hard to find older movies, especially in DVD format, but I had no problem finding this one.

B004GHNIRK|3.0|A long and complex book. The actual story of the main characters is very good but hard to follow because of Victor Hugo's excursions into the political and philosophical aspects of France's History at this time. It would be great if there were 2 books, one being the fictional story and the other the non fiction.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Arrived quickly. Was not scratched, and the case was in good shape. This was a great value when compared to new.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Not as good as the 1st Book of the trilogy. Too many unbelievable coincidences. A good account of the history of the period<br />as it affects people who lived through it.

B0090NNQX6|4.0|For his third album, Mika does an about face and lunges face first into dance pop. This is more a Pet Shop Boys departure than a George Michael, gilded electronically and laced with precision beats. His unique voice still stands head and shoulders above all the production and auto-tuning (hey he really didn't need this much of it, thanks), and the songs are still catchier than a tackle-box. Once again, Mika borrows heavily from the classic pop songbook; if you don't think of The Buggles during \\"Love You When I'm Drunk,\\" you're missing the point.<br /><br />But there's something missing, which the delightful \\"Lola\\" points out. When Mika isn't being dancified or vocoded half to death, he's a stunningly original artist. Great songs like the title track and \\"Make You Happy\\" are gossamered to the point where the beauty of what was so apparent on \\"Life In cartoon Motion\\" and \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\" is nearly buried. Mika is in a new phase of his career, and he still excels. Just be prepared if you're coming off those first two albums. \\"Origin Of Love\\" is a different animal entirely.

B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Fresh off the 2012 Election campaign trail, Kid Rock continues to rock my world with his new album &#34;Rebel Soul&#34;.  I expected this album to be political the same way &#34;Born Free&#34; appeared to be. However this album at least from my point of view was less serious. Born Free focused more on the issues whereas this album focuses more on how he achieves to still be so political: Rock n' Roll.  One of my favorite lyrics on the album is from the song &#34;3 Catt Boogie&#34;: &#34;Now the preacher man's yellin' that Book of Revelation And Uncle Sam's sellin' us a one-world nation Banks hedgin' bets for the next generation And Wall Street's stirrin' up the whole situation&#34;. I like all songs on the album: (Let's Ride)  The anthem for the troops, the tribute to his hometown (Detroit, Michigan) and the headliner Rebel Soul. Unexpectedly different songs included The Mirror, Cucci Galore and Midnight Ferry.  Tthe songs that really made his point on this album were God Save Rock n' Roll, Celebrate, Redneck Paradise and Mr. Rock n' Roll. Kid Rock is really about good ole Rock n' Roll and he celebrates Rock n' Roll to the fullest. I think this album is amazing.  It is put together to express a certain lifestyle and more importantly, every single song expresses Kid Rock. He is just being himself and living the life he is living.  I am a huge Kid Rock fan. Everything he says on his album and in interviews inspires me. He is my hero.

B00A3DZ61W|5.0|OK, so I figured I was done playing these Angry Birds games.  Rio was a bit weak, Space was somewhat fun.  But, then they added the Star Wars angle, and I was brought back in.  I suppose the next step is Angry Birds Lego.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are amazing. Their music is beautiful, fun, and inspiring. Some of the songs even make a good workout track (like Code Name Vivaldi). My kids love it as well. Now they are pretending to play the cello and are better at practicing the piano!
B001AJ09JW|4.0|Have always loved this movie. I couldn't find it for free on the internet, and Netflix didn't have it either. I got in on amazon for 2.99, which is normal for renting a movie. The great thing about It is that you don't have to worry about getting the movie back on time! The only downside, Is it skipped a few times, which could have been my internets error too. All in all GREAT!
B000M341QO|5.0|The Departed I found out was a remake of a forgein film from China, but what an amazing job Martin Scorsese did with the cast and script.  Truly an all star cast with Leo, Matt, Jack, and Mark, plus Martin Sheen and few others within the film.  To me it is one of the single best crime drama movies I have ever seen during the course of my lifetime watching movies.  I have watched a ton of movies because movies, music, and books are my life.  So if you enjoy Martin Scorsese films and also love a good crime drama movie with lots of great diologue and action mixed with who's working for whom then pick this up and watch this great crime drama movie.  Bonus note to add I truly enjoy the song they played over and over again during the course of the movie the band is called Dropkick Murphys and the song is called \\"I'm shipping up to Boston.\\"  Really good punk rock song to get you going.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I don't buy many cds, but I was totally sold by the youtube videos, and decided I wanted to wake up every morning with a track of Piano Guys to start my day.  Love, love, and did I already say love?, the cd.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|This movie is much different then normal suspense trillers or mystery thrillers that most of us are use to.  Leo does a great acting job and the supporting actors add to the drama and intensity of the film.  I have personally watched it 3 times now since I've have bought it a while ago.  It took me watching it 3 times to fully understand the whole movie and what the main character meant at the end of the movie.  So if you like Martin Scorsese movies then pick this movie up and watch it all the way threw to fully understand the movie and whole plotline of the movie your watching.  It is really a good suspense triller and lots of drama.  Buy it and make up your own mind about the actors and the plotline because it is a good movie.
B004QSQMKE|2.0|I grew up watching this movie over and over. The original soundtrack by Tangerine Dream made the movie for me, and helped create the world.<br />The director's cut has new scenes that were mercifully cut from the theatrical release, and a new soundtrack that puts a weird campy, pathos-ridden feel to the movie.<br /><br />I couldn't even get 20min in without turning it off, it was that bad.<br /><br />If you're going to get this movie, buy the original theatrical release.

B0028AQLYE|3.0|It's like breathing through a straw & feels harder once you get in the water.<br />Keeps it dry if you are in a lake & not in a hurry.<br />Very restricting in a pool if you are trying to swim fast or for a long time even if you are very fit.<br />Snorkel in a pool doesn't really need it, it's easier to stop & blow out purge valve once in awhile so you get more volume all the time.<br /><br />It would be nice if they designed this with a quick release so you can change your mind based on need on the spot.<br />But because you have to soak it every time you remove or replace it, it's kind of a pain & sometimes gets stuck no matter how hot the water is or how long you soak it.<br />Unless you really need it, don't bother.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Muse remains my rock of choice and they continue to satisfy. The sound has evolved somewhat in this album from the prior albums, I assume as experimentation in current trends, but the classic Muse is still in there and still rocks a long road trip like no other.

0571238343|5.0|Having this book makes me feel like I'm an animator through osmosis.  Though that's highly unrealistic, you'll discover through this book some simple ways to break down character actions and animation - but this is after you get through true animation basics and understandings of movement and his versions of the basics/guidelines of animating anything.  Love using this as a reference too.
B009IJJ712|5.0|Just downloaded the pilot of this show and loved it.  I watch a lot of mysteries and this is top quality.  It has the intensity of the British version SHERLOCK, which we love, but with more of a NYC than London vibe.  Can't wait for my son who lives and works in NYC to come home and watch these episodes with me.  He enjoyed SHERLOCK (and DOWNTON ABBEY) and has been asking if I've found another equally good series.  Glad to have them in our private library.<br /><br />The plot was intriguingly complex, good NYC gritty scenery, like the actors.  This looks like a very fresh and original series. These are going to be addictive, I can see already.

Rod's voice, which isn't much these days anyway, is totally ill-suited to Christmas tunes, especially over-produced David Foster ones. This was a gift to me, thankfully - I hope the well-meaning friend who gave it to me didn't spend much.<br /><br />Put on Rod singing 'Every Picture Tells a Story' and listen to Perry or Bing or Nat or Ella or Dean or Frank or Sammy or Andy for Christmas instead.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Awesome CD!  He does an awesome job on \\"Red Suited Superman,\\" the duet with Ella Fitzgerald \\"WhatAre You Doing New Year's Eve?\\" is stunning in its beauty.  The duet with Michael Buble \\"Winter Wonderland\\" Stewart easily outshines his counterpart.  The duet with Cee Lo Green on \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" is comparable to his duet with Mr. Isley on \\"I Love You.\\"  He also does a great version of \\"We Three Kings,\\" with Mary J. Blige.  \\"Silent Night is absolutely wonderful, and beautiful.  And the Scotch Irish celtic lily of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is touching and absolutely marvelous!  \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" is a surprising but sensible choice but a great one, describing the wonderment of a child, or one who is a child at heart.  A total of 13 songs on the album, and there is not a bad song on the album.  In his 60's, Rod Stewart can still sing, and much like Tony Bennett, his voice is like a fine wine that improves with time.  Great album, and a sure holiday classic!

B0047Y17P2|5.0|He is a superb author, and the Lincoln Lawyer series is one of the best I have read in quite a long time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is the second book, by Kate Morton,  that I have read and I must admit I've become a fan.<br />I like the process she takes as she introduces new characters. Her descriptions of the surroundings are such that I can picture them as I read.  The characters a filled out so that they become very real.  I enjoy the bits of history that I find woven into the story's fabric.  This book has kept me interested from beginning to end because it moves right along and takes me with it.  I look forward to another Kate Morton story.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|As previously stated, Judy Dench is one of the finest actresses of our time.  This movie is heart warming, very entertaining and quite poinient.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|AnnaSophia Robb (gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde in \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\") shines as Bethany Hamilton, a real-life young Hawaiian surfer who lost her arm in a shark attack. \\"Soul Surfer\\" may not be the first film about athletes who refuses to give up their dreams (my favorite is James Stewart's \\"The Stratton Story\\"), and true, the film did not win any Oscar, but \\"Soul Surfer\\" delivers nonetheless, thanks to the strong performance from the star and beautifully shot surf sequences.<br /><br />Most of you have already known the amazing story of Bethany Hamilton, and even you don't, well, it's OK. All you have to know that the story is inspirational to everyone, even those who are not particularly interested in surfing.<br /><br />What makes the film special is the presence of AnnaSophia Robb, who embodies the heroine's indomitable spirit. Some complain (understandably) that her portrayal of Bethany Hamilton looks a bit too saintly. It is also true that despite the shocking incident and several complications that follow, AnnaSophia Robb's Bethany remains patient and resilient. But we also should know that some people can really behave like that. And remember, we are talking about someone who lost her arm in October, 2003 and came back to a surf competition in January, 2004!<br /><br />Director Sean McNamara re-creates the shark attack convincingly, with vivid (not graphic) details about the attack itself and how she was brought to the hospital. Another merit of the film is the surf competition scenes, which I find surprisingly thrilling and involving, even though I have never seen one before.<br /><br />My only complaint is Carrie Underwood's character and the Thailand episode that I think need more depth. That said, with a solid supporting cast including Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt and Craig T. Nelson (more like an extended cameo though), \\"Soul Surfer\\" offers an uplifting tale of a real-life person who is determined to move on.

B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|Boris the Animal, a vengeful alien with a grudge against Agent K, escapes the prison on the moon, and goes back in time to kill young Agent K. To set the course of time back into the original, Agent J also time-travels back to 1969, to prevent the criminal alien from murdering K. It's a pretty typical storyline, but still acceptable.<br /><br />In \\"Men in Black 3\\" you don't see Tommy Lee Jones (second-billed) very much. Josh Brolin plays the younger (and more emotional) version of Agent K, and his portrayal of the character is spot-on. Jemaine Clement as Boris effectively manages to balance between a deadly enemy and silly villain. But sorry, no talking pug this time.<br /><br />The story of \\"Men in Black 3\\" takes mostly in 1969, which means jokes often rely on cultural references from the time. Some of them work, like the one about Andy Warhol and his famous soup can, but most of them are not particularly great. What is worse is the thin story that is not very interesting, except the final 20 minutes, where we are finally reminded that the film was about time-travelling.<br /><br />It took five years for them to make a sequel to \\"Men in Black.\\" Then it took ten years to make another sequel. Will Smith looks old, and so does Tommy Lee Jones. It's inevitable, as the first one was made about 15 years ago. I know the magic of the original is gone forever. \\"Men in Black 3\\" is amusing, but I still don't know why this has to be made after 15 years.
B005XN3150|5.0|Over the course of the last few years, it seems as though fairytales have become all the rage. Comics, TV shows, movies, books, and probably more have taken to re-telling fairytales, and these re-tellings are flying off the shelves. I'm not sure what made so many creative minds suddenly turn to fairytales, but I'm certainly not complaining. Amongst all these new re-tellings is Once Upon a Time, an ABC television drama. While a lot of the modern fairytale stuff I've come across has been good, Once Upon a Time is BY FAR the best.<br /><br />So, here's the basic plot, for anyone who may not know: The Evil Queen from \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\\", after failing in her attempt to poison Snow White with her apple, casts a curse. This curse moves every fairytale character to our world, erases their memories of who they are, and puts all kinds of obstacles in their way to keep them from reaching their happy endings. It's fun to see how some of the characters translate into the real world. The Evil Queen, for example, has become the Mayor of the town all the characters reside in, and Jiminy Cricket is a therapist. Every episode has something going on in our world, and flashbacks to the old fairytale world that show us the characters' backstories and motives. The writing is a lot like the show \\"Lost\\", as many of its crew are involved in Once Upon a Time, but so far the show isn't nearly as complex or convuluted as Lost was. It is still complex, but not so much that it makes your head explode. I've been telling people that this show is \\"Lost Lite\\".<br /><br />The show is an extremely enjoyable ride, and I was hooked almost immediately. Every character has an amazing amount of depth and realism to them, and it's very fun to see such iconic and classic characters done in a way that's so real and so complex. Almost every major character has a huge internet following, and rightfully so. This show has become a massive hit, and it's easy to see why. With its complex characters, storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and inventive reimagining of all the big fairytales, this show is easily the best television to come out in years. I have gotten several of my friends and family to watch the show, and they're all about as obsessed with it as I am. You won't regret giving it a shot!storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and inventive reimagining of all the big fairytales, this show is easily the best television to come out in years.

B009IA9OLE|1.0|Dont buy this game. All u do is go back and forth until somebody loses. The best thing about this app is u get to make your place like u want it and even then its boring cuz after u buy like five to six things u can't buy anymore things until u go further in the game<br />Don't buy
0385536828|2.0|Reading this novel reminds me of the experience of having unrealistically high expectations for an auto you've spent too much on: When the auto doesn't meet your expectations, you're angry with the manufacturer. Earlier, I enjoyed McEwan's Saturday and really liked A Child in Time. Enduring Love was another good one. So, I expected much from Tooth and was disappointed when it turned out, so far as my tastes were concerned, to involve characters I didn't believe in doing things I didn't think they'd do.<br /><br />Among the non-credible characters: Serena, whose point of view (albeit for good reason) never seemed to me feminine; Max, who had no reason to fall in love with her or her with him; and Tom, whose final letter to Serena no human was likely ever to have written. The trick ending, which I won't give away, did nothing to redeem 300 pages of slow reading.<br /><br />I can see that readers who have an interest in the cold war, and in the interplay between freedom of expression and politics, may get their literary teeth into this cold fare, but, in my opinion, it will take such an interest to generate any enthusiasm.<br /><br />I may read McEwan again, but not without first seeing how the book was
0345803493|5.0|EVERY woman needs to read this book. You will not be disappointed.. It is a little Twilight ish, but its amazing
B009HEN7LY|5.0|Loved this movie. Brolin did a great job as a young K. The movie was full of alien excitement, and the end was just what the series needed!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been a fan of The Piano Guys since before they assumed that name. Originally, it was just Jon Schmidt and Steve Nelson giving Christmas concerts at The Univ of Utah Kingsbury Hall. As their music became more popular far and wide, they have \\"lengthened their stride\\" and steadily produced music and videos which inspire visually as well as audibly. Their first CD is a wonderful compilation of their most popular selections.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|This is a good story, a bit on the dark side, but ultimately a happy ending; as good animation should be.
0345803485|1.0|The point in reading a book that was not only based off of the crappy series in mankind, Twilight. But a book that is possibly WORSE than Twilight? This is mom porn basically. None of the people are intelligent. And I have to ask, who. the. f*. wrote this? A sex crazed teenager just learning to get out of text talk?!<br /><br />HOW DID THIS BECOME A BESTSELLER?!?!<br /><br />...Women. That's who.<br /><br />Women who want equal rights but yet give into books about being dominated and controlled and turned into slaves. Just wow. How about this book go shove itself in it's own dirty hole and pray I never have to see this again. This is what trash looks like people.<br /><br />If I see you reading this I will automatically think that you are reading this for the fact that you were curious what an even worse book than Twilight reads like, and also what makes this book so infamous and gross and just flat out unintelligent.<br /><br />If you are a woman reading this and tell me this is a marvelous book I will leave a mental note in my head and avoid you in the future.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go read anything but this. Buy yourself a classic mindscrew like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. That is seriously intelligent and marvelous and absolutely crazy! None of it makes sense and it is written like a true pro. (Because Lewis Carroll IS a pro!)<br /><br />However this book...was not. And you won't either if you read it.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Heard a cut from this cd on the David Letterman show recently, and so I went to You Tube (God, don't you just love You Tube?!) to hear it again, and hear some of the other cuts  too. If you liked Steely Dan or are a Donald Fagen fan, then this cd does not disappoint...it's classic! Typical of the style and arrangements that we old heads are accustomed to from back in the day when we listened to Aja, Babylong Sisters, Black Cow, Deacon Blues, and others...I guess Donald, like those of us who are his long time fans, is growing old...or should I say \\"older\\" too, along wit the rest of us...I have to chuckle to myself as I listen to the lyrics of \\"Slinky Thing\\" a little ditty about this little \\"lithe\\" young hottie, who just happens to be drawn to the the vibe of, \\"...the old dude at the club.\\" when all evidence suggests that she'd be better served by being with someone \\"...closer to her own age...\\" uh huh...but it just be's like that sometime, right? If by some twist of fate, time allows you one more little chance at having some joy, you'd better hold on to that \\"Slinky Thing!\\"

B004BSFC46|5.0|I bought these for my daughter when she was two months old and she has consistently enjoyed them for the past four months. They definitely catch her attention and are constructed well. The rattle is loud enough for my little one to enjoy it. It is definitely a quieter rattle than some other toys, I prefer this for younger babies though -- so it isn't a negative. We do no put them on her wrists that often, she likes to hold them and chew on them now, but they still fit easily around my average-sized six month old's wrists.  We used to dangle them from her play gym and she would smile and babble at them. They are great to bring with you while traveling or to just have on hand in the diaper bag. Money well spent!

B0099G7KDQ|4.0|These songs sound almost exactly like Mumford and Sons' last album.  This does not displease me, because I really liked their last CD.  They seem to have found their niche and are not going to shift out of it.  Truly though, if any of these songs came up on shuffle... I wouldn't be able to tell which album it was from.<br /><br />I like it now that I own it, but it didn't really contribute anything new to my music collection.  I might not purchase it again now that I know this.

B002NHGG92|5.0|A year or so ago I started watching this show and was instantly addicted!  I love TV shows... But this show is by far my favorite!  I love the storyline, and even the history that they sometimes bring!! I'd reccommend it to anyone.  And who wouldn't want to watch Ian Somerhalder?
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Such amazing music.  Me and my kids listen literally every day.  My favorite is \\"Peponi\\" but really every song is fabulous.  Also, if you ever get a chance to see the Piano Guys in concert its well worth your money.

B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I saw this, YEARS ago, on TV. I loved it. Of course, ever since have been looking for it. No one knew what I was talking about. They only think of Wizard of Oz, with Judy Garland. I saw this when I was a teenager and I still remember it 15 years later. I wish they would make the other books over, like this was. They did a GREAT job! If you loved the 1939 Wizard of Oz with Judy Garland, you have to see The Return to Oz at least once.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Not exactly what I was expecting, but it was nevertheless a cute movie.  I love any movie about the Irish ;)
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|This movie was something I was not really sure how they were going to adapt to film from the book.  They did an ok job but, I would say they missed the boat on identifying with the characters and Peeta was cast wrong.  Not sure if Katniss was cast correctly either.  Prim was not as small and innocent as she came across in the book.  I do like the casting of Haymitch, Katniss' mother, Effie, President Snow, and Rue.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie was just ok.  Could have been so much better.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I just finished reading the Kindle version of this book a day after purchasing it and I really enjoyed it.  But then, I am a lover of books that relate the message that we are all one and that the physical reality we experience every day is not all there is and in fact is more of an illusion than the spiritual realm of thoughts, emotions, and ideas. I find this type of message extremely comforting and it always rings true to me.  I have to admit that I have been going through a rough time with un/underemployment and searching for decent work etc. so this book sort of acted like a release valve tonight and helped me to remember that we are all loved and not to let things get me down for too long because in the end, like Bill Hick's said, \\"it's just a ride.\\"<br /><br />I'm happy the author decided to tell his inspiring and comforting story and I hope the fact that we are all one, here to experience what we're not, starts to seep into general discourse and belief.  When you get annoyed at other people just remember that they're just you being them and you are just them being you. I definitely recommend the book and admit that I shed a few tears reading the poem towards the end of the book.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Well I never saw the original show this is named after ,but this movie was just alright. Nothing in this film will have you on the edge of your seat ,and though it is suppose to be funny the best I got was a smile but no haha funny. Rent if you like Johnny Depp ,or vampire stuff. On a side note it is way better than Twilight by a mile..lol.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great Read! I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I love the way it goes back and forth from present to past, really puts a good story line together.

B004LROUNG|5.0|Very clear overview of law and qualities u don't want in a lawyer. The characters are interesting and kept me in suspense.  I have always been a fan of this author. Good job.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are the best thing I've ever discovered on YouTube.  Their music is wonderful and their videos are amazing feats considering the very few people involved in making them.  What I love most is the cunning way they fuse modern music with classical pieces, creating something completely unique.  These guys are incredibly talented and I would recommend that everyone check them out if you haven't already done so.

This CD is packed with a number of amazing works that not only sound beautiful, but are able to be enjoyed by those who listen to the music of today, which is quite a large accomplishment considering how music has changed throughout the years.
1400067820|5.0|This book is extremely dense with thought provoking material. I am a radiologist and I especially sympathize with some of his views on the medical profession/system.

0316212377|4.0|I am a longstanding Iain M. Banks fan.  For me, I would rate this about 2 or 3 stars compared to the rest of his work, but 5+ compared to most of the dreck out there, so I'm compromising and giving it 4 stars.<br /><br />This is a perfectly good \\"Culture\\" Space-Opera hard-science fiction novel.  If you are an Iain Banks fan, or you just like spaceships and androids and stuff, you will likely enjoy this book.  But.  For me, it's feeling a bit formulaic.  It has the silly spaceship names, the overly-complex gadgets, the tongue-in-cheek dialog, etc., but we've been there before.  It feels just a bit like checking off all the boxes.<br /><br />In my (highly fallible) opinion, the Culture needs another Idiran war (i.e., a serious opponent for you non-Banks readers).  They need something that they almost can't handle.  Or maybe, something that they CAN'T handle.  Or some great task that they were just hanging around for and now can sublime,  Whatever.  Shake it up a bit, Mr. Banks!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Beautiful-looking, but let down by ridiculous characters. 1 out of 5 stars for Amazon, who streamed this SO SLOWLY (even though my internet is capable) that the quality was similarr to watching a hooky Betamax.

B009HV2JT8|2.0|The trailer was the best part of the movie.  It started out interesting, but the plot and story line got more and more ridiculous as the movie progressed.  Kids might like it but don't recommend it for anyone over 15.
B00881VLCE|4.0|it works great, no complaints. I would recommend it to anyone who likes jigsaw puzzles.  the best part was that it was free.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Cat's Cradle was given to me from a box of moldy old paperbacks back in 1987 in the jungle on the Venezuelan-Colombian border near San Antonio del Tachira. It expanded my mind sufficiently until I gave up smuggling,  eventually gained a PhD and opened my eyes to the inanity of what most agree is reality. Not to be missed by anyone.

B0001I562I|5.0|A fun fun movie for the entire family to watch. Some of the ideas were ahead of it's time when it first came out but still presented well here. The movie deals with some adult problems but it's not too heavy for the younger set. I liked it when I first saw it as a youngster, a long time ago, and my children loved it when I showed it to them. Buy it and see it as a family, I think you will all enjoy it....we did.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book is awesome. I really love stuff about zombies. The author is great and makes the ultimate zombie definition
B0000047CX|4.0|Very soothing and pleasant. Nice background and conversation music. Really enjoy these artists. Would recommend for relaxation and unwinding moments!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Awesome book. Tells you everything you need to know for surviving the zombie apocalypse and a little more. It's a must read.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book actually kept me engaged all the way through. It's pretty ridiculous and the parts about jobs were a bit embarrassing, but hey, I read it, liked the references and got most of them.
034580404X|1.0|after all the hype i picked up fifty shades of gray in the SFO airport bookstore...this book was so poorly written and predictable I left it on the plane. waste of money!
B00574P964|1.0|DIARY OF A WIMPY KID; RODRICK RULES...SOUND VOLUME VERY LOW..COULD NOT HEAR IT.....WASTED MONEY TO RENT....WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FILM.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great way to develop a multi character story by focusing at each time in each person. Great read and great story.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Loved the movie and all the features - still can't believe how cheap it was. Highly recommended for anyone just looking for a good quality DVD.
B009329Y30|5.0|hubby and I both enjoyed this movie- not too sweet, and not too brutal- just enough realistic to keep us roped in and rooting them on! families are complicated- people have their stories, and this flick reminds us to listen to the stories of others and not just assume that we are the only on with a story at all... heartfelt, and not sugary sweet!
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|This is a must see film, full of suspense and twists.  I will definitely view it again!<br />The film is not for children.  It keeps one on the edge of the seat.  Great plot and acting.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|This book started off well, but I felt it got bogged down in stories-within-the-story and boring Cold War MI5 details
B0041B4H1M|4.0|By any objective measure, Deep Blue Sea is a terrible movie. The story is ridiculous, the acting phoned in by actors who have done better and can do better, the dialogue inane, filmed with a color palette that does not deviate from the cliched teal/orange designed to pop and look cool. But, it's so ridiculous that it's just plain fun. You can't take it seriously, so you just go along with it. The Blu-Ray has the same features as previous DVDs, while the picture and sound are excellent. (By the way, a fun little tidbit: The sharks die in the same way and order as the sharks in the Jaws movies - blown up, electrocuted, blown up.)
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We love everything about The Piano Guys!!  Not only do they make music fun, they inspire people young and old to learn a new instrument or pick up an old one!!  The Piano Guys have made instrumental/classical music cool!!  Can't wait for another CD!!
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|I won’t bother going into the merits of the score itself.  If you are reading this review, you probably already know this score is simply one of the greatest in cinema history.  After nearly a two decade search, the master session tapes were located and now film music fans can rejoice.  Finally, with this release we are able to hear every note recorded including source music and alternate takes.  My previous copy was the rare Varese CD which I have listened to so much, I know every nuance of every note in the performances.  This is part of the reason I was never really interested in the re-recording that came out a little while ago.  Anything less than the original recording just didn’t sound right to me.  Even if the fidelity was less than optimal, just the fact the composer himself conducted made the original the final word.  Now we get the best of both worlds, the classic performance in excellent sound quality.  The tapes have been remixed for this release but there is nothing that stands out as sounding “different” other than the new level of clarity and depth.  Producers Fake and Tarantino have done a great job and clearly handled this project with loving care.  The only thing that is slightly different is that “Warpaint” crossfades into “The Kitchen” exactly like it does in the film.  On the Varese release “The Kitchen” did not fade in, which I prefer, so If you have the Varese release and are insane like me, you may want to hold on to it.  The new previously unreleased pieces are varied but mostly excellent.  Some of the best are “Pit Fights”, “The Snake/Infidels”,  and  “Battle of the Mounds part II”.  Others  such as “Warm Welcome”, “Wolf Witch”, “Hopefuls at the Tower”, “The Hall of King Osric”  are primarily atmospheric  in the context of the film and while they are certainly interesting and welcome by completists, are dreadfully repetitive and not exactly repeat listening material.  The third disc of the original MCA release is a nice bonus and worth having if only to have the version of “Anvil of Crom” without the prologue.  I highly recommend this release for all fans of great movie music.  It’s a shame that Poledouris never got to see his complete masterpiece given this deluxe treatment,  but the music will live on forever .
1451688091|4.0|I am only a couple of chapters into this book by Doris Kearns Goodwin, but already I know I like it. If a book captivates my interest in a couple of chapters, then it is worth reading. Mrs. Goodwin seems to have a similiar talent to that of David McCullough: they know how to bring long dead imporant people, back to life, back to the flesh and blood, the good qualities and the flaws, of their long-dead selves. It is excellent so far.
B004V6X90W|1.0|Really disappointed in Carrey for this one. One of the grossest softcore gay porn movies I've seen. It really has utterly no reason to be made.<br /><br />If it were about a heterosexual couple it'd still be gross. The bad taste doesn't have anything to do with the gay slant of the movie.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The charm of this movie, is the fact that I can relate to the aging characters in it. The  characters in &#34;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&#34;, find themselves, at that certain age, at a crossroads in their lives, as I find myself now. These characters are charming and real and find the courage in themselves, and each other, to take risk and change the course of their lives. It's a lovely film, and the actors are all heartwarming.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I have been playing the Morricone CD every day for two weeks, and purchased three copies as gifts.  So rich, deep, and flowing.....  Gorgeous music
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|It's just like like the SAC I remember in 1953 / 1957 while in the USAF , only I was in B 47 .
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is so worth the money.  I listened to these guys on youtube before the album came out.  It's very well produced and the music is excellent.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is truly a fantastic album.  The Piano Guys' fresh, classical take on many pop hits is pure genius!  The covers are musically thoughtful and emotionally exciting!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that it is a fun app but some of the games are really hard. overall I would give it a 4 or a 4 and a half because I really like it. there are tons of games and people would probably be happy with this app. (p.s. its free!)
B009H442DG|5.0|I have to say that I always enjoyed both Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta since I was a little kid. When I happened to come across this album I had to have it. I placed the order immediately and it arrived today. I listened to the entire album and it finally placed me in the Christmas mood this year. Though(in my opinion) John's voice isn't very good Olivia sounds just as good as she did in Grease. The songs they chose are all Christmas Classics except for one and John was able to get by still making the songs HIGHLY enjoyable. For those of you who enjoy the classic Christmas Songs, this album will surely please you. It has become my ultimate Christmas Album so far.
146500632X|5.0|Arrived in good shape! Very nice calendar, and I am sure that my daughter will love it throughout the whole year!
B0002IQOZA|2.0|I would like to start off saying I am truly an admirer of Christina. There has never been a singer who has WOW'd me with the depth of their voice, nor the beauty of their face as much as Christina has done over the years. She is truly a powerhouse. Unfortunately, because of the power of her voice, it just doesn't seem like a Christmas Album(or rather the Christmas I am use to anyways). Her version of \\"This Christmas\\" is the reason I purchased this album and I have to say I love that track but the majority of the other songs are really over the top and just leave me feeling as though I am listening to the R&B radio station, not a Christmas Album. A great singer, a great beauty but she really needs to tone it down in the proper places. I believe this girl could become the next Barbara Steisand of this generation. If you like traditional Christmas music, this album is not for you.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG boring and LOOOOOOOOOOOONG. I watched it in two sittings.  But hey Christian I watched Flowers of War and thought it was great.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is really good I would read it over and over again if I could<br />I can not wait till The House of Hades comes out!!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob Dylan is my all time favorite singer from his first album to this.  Love every song and his aging voice is soulful.
0679809015|5.0|beautiful fun and captivating drawings. If you need to calm you kids down or distract them from their tantrums, this is it!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|She is so gifted and talented.  I love every song she has on this CD and her writing is fantastic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|re- reading the trilogy.because nothing fills the void. loved the ending looking forward to for Christian's side. many can imitate or even duplicate, but if it's not @E L James it's no good.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia Keys is on fire in this one.  Nice mixture of her music style.  Now I may go back and purchase other CD's she has done.  this was my first.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|They have a different take on songs that are beautiful and inspiring. They are really good and have very awesome videos to match the songs. Lots of beautiful places chosen that compliment the song and they way it is performed. I love my copy
B001A3CP5Y|5.0|I have always enjoyed listening to these songs on the radio, don't know why I never purchased the CD before, but it is great.  Fun listening.
030759565X|5.0|I tend to go overboard with buying cookbooks, so my Spouse put me on cookbook purchasing restriction.  But I got this as a gift for my birthday and all I can say is WOW!  I've so far have made about half a dozen of the recipes and all came out great.  I love that she has a story or a write about with eact recipe. It made me want to spend time on each page and look at each recipe.  From someone that owns way too many cookbooks, this one is definitely recomended!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This series exceeded my expectations.  Can hardly wait to see the 3rd season.  Keeps you interested in both servant and master lives--both are equally interesting.  Show loyalty from both classes and the changing of times that take place during that era.  Nice to see
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Like I said, it's a good game.  The graphics are crisp and clear and the aiming mechanism is spot on.  However, the delay at the end of a game seems a bit long.  After playing my first game, I thought that this app had hung up my device.  Finally, the player name box showed up and I was able to move on.<br /><br />Also, I'm not too happy that this app sends information to the Internet without my permission.  True, it only seems to be my score, still I don't like this action being done blindly--it should give the user a choice or at least some kind of warning.  A user option to turn this on or off would be a nice addition.  For now, I'll just play this game with my Internet connection turned off--that will solve it.<br /><br />One other thing, at one point while playing, the sound just stopped.  It didn't effect the gameplay at all, it was just odd.<br /><br />All and all, it is a fun game to play, even with the above issues.
B000TEMRIU|5.0|I love the Smashing Pumpkins and it's great to have this album on my computer now.  The only issue I had with the purchase is that the album was automatically labeled &#34;pop&#34; which I feel is absurdly incorrect.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|For those concerned about the lack of coins, just keep playing. Collect all of the bonus pieces and keep leveling up. Learn the best times to use your shake power and take advantage of the coin walls. I just reached level 187 and have 6132 coins :)
B008HK3XU4|2.0|I like the fact that the kindle snaps into the case and it has the band to keep it protected. However, Idid not like that when it is set up to read hands-free it always slides down into a flat position.  Because of this I don't think that I would purchase it again or even recommend it.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I loved it it let me be batman and also upgrade my character best 7dollars ever. a must get game
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I absolutely love this cover for my Kindle Fire. The embroidery is beautiful and the cover is very sturdy which protects my Kindle Fire very well. I would definitely recommend!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I also have solitare on my laptop and like that version alittle better, but this one is OK...hard to figure out how to get out of the game and not as user friendly
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Excellent for when you are commuting on the bus or train.  You can hear all of your selections from the cloud.
B0047SF41G|4.0|wish the star was the predators, and not the humans. Overall, enjoyed the movie. Still not as good as the original.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I rented this movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. One needs to watch it with a sense of humor. There is a great deal of violence and it is, therefore, not for small children. They might become upset. I found the joining of so many superheroes very entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the first game ive ever rated the full five stars and it is completely worth it. I play it all the time it is so fun and I have had no problems with it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am sure everyone has seen these movies, and it was worth watching again in blu ray. If you have not seen these movies in years this is definately a gift worth buying.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|it was great seeing all the headline action actors in one movie<br />the first one was better then this sequel
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am enjoying it - just got the Kindle so I am very new to this - I don't like the adds between each game so I would like to find a way to stop that
B009GEEMLY|4.0|good story line<br />the actors don't over act<br />great use of graphics<br />great family movie<br />would see it again !
B0063B2BNE|5.0|This show is great!  I love watching it.  Bones and Booth are great together and make the show educational as well as amusing.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Our family has been listening to The Piano Guys since the beginning....actually my husband and I have been listening to Jon Schmidt (the pianist) and gone to many of his local concerts for about 14 years! They never disappoint. What a talented group! Thank you for sharing your amazing talents with us Piano Guys!
B004GJYROG|5.0|My son couldn't get enough of this movie when he was little, so I knew I had be buy it for when I have grandkids.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I recently purchased a new Macbook Air 13, and wanted to use my old MagSafe Cord when I traveled. I have both new Macbook Air 13 and the older Macbook Air 11. I can switch from one to another using the old cord, with this adaptor without any issues. Much cheaper alternative to purchase this converter then buying a new MagSafe 2.
0062014102|5.0|The author gets a little too involved at times in the narrative, but not enough to detract from his great work. Awesome little book for those just starting out on a different path in life. Lots of good information and not too much on the heavy physics of the whole thing. Tons of good little stories and examples of how people can change their perception of the world.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|so excited to finally have this on my kindle. all the cleverness and challenge in a smaller package. and here are some extra words so I can submit this review.
1603420398|5.0|The directions are clear. The drawings instructive. There are so many choices for designs and wonderful suggestions for making your projects interesting.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love everything that The Piano Guys do. This album is no exception. Great work, and so wonderful to listen to!
1603425381|5.0|This is a fantastic book for learning interesting boarders to add to your projects. I can't wait to try some.
B000002HHB|5.0|I had this in cassette, but ordered the CD to upgrade.  The music is awesome and Natalie has the most calming voice.
0547564651|5.0|I listened to the blog &#34;This American Life&#34; and heard about this book. I wanted to read it because I agree with the author. We spend too much time testing students and not enough time teaching them to get along with others.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|That's right, I said it, and I stand by it. Better than Dark Knight, Watchmen, X-Men, Spider Man, Wolverine... simply the best.
B005GG0MIS|1.0|Very very slow read. It took a while to get through the book. It was purchased as part of the book club and needless to say it will never be read again.
B001HN6922|5.0|Loved this movie because it is family friendly.  I would recommend it for anyone.  Fun, funny, and entertaining.  My 2 year old great nephew loves it as well.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Loved it, Great cinematography, and attention to details. Definitely as good as the first movie, and worth seeing it again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story of how a marriage can go astray, with the added complication of a seriously disturbed manipulator. Not happy with the ending but well done otherwise.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I downloaded this app directly to my android device (mobile phone) and it started working instantly.  It downloads the videos on YouTube with many options.  I chose the normal downloaded option, and I didn't need to install any other plugin.  Once you download the video, you can also copy the video in this program, and save it as an mp3 file as well.  You don't lose the original video file.  Also, you can create playlists directly within this program(your option). Overall, this program is very easy to use.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|LOVED this series of Batman movies.  I have all of them (not cartoons) and have been a fan of Batman my whole life.  This is a great conclusion to the Nolan ones.<br />Liked Joseph Gordon-Leavitt in this movie.  He is a pretty decent and diverse actor.
